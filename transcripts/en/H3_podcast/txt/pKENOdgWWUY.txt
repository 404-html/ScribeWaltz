Speaker 1:          00:00:05       Welcome everybody to the h podcast experience. You guys know that today's episode is sponsored by Ring Quip and me on Ds. We have got so many great things today. I don't hear the music because the music play. Oh yeah, great, great, great, great, great, great. Today we've got such wonderful things. We've got Logan Paul tweet of the century erased and reborn. We've got Roseanne finally speaking out. And boy, you don't want to miss this. So good. We have got other and lots of stuff. We've got another episode of know your meme given away a brand new s nine plus. What what? Um, this time featuring everybody's favorite virgin skippy. Actually we have a new call in number two that I think is really suiting that. I think everyone is going to really enjoy it. You can reach us for now and forevermore at eight zero eight hot meme, that's eight oh eight hot meme and e m e as you all know.

Speaker 1:          00:01:16       So that's our permanent number. Keep it handy. Uh, guys, you can start ringing in now to play. Know your meme after the break featuring everyone's favorite virgin skippy ilos back. Thank God, thank the gods she is. It's a little too soon for her to hop in front of the camera. So she is uh, and back right now she's here, she's cracking whips. She is making sure that everybody is crossing their t's and dotting their i's back there. They're all in mortal fear of you right now. It's true. No fucking around this time. But we will be having a special episode next week on Tuesday. I think what it's just gonna be me and Isla probably just like a 30 minute little app where we can just kind of talk, bring her back, get her back in, see how she's doing. And then on Thursday we've got dunky video game donkey and Leah. It'd be great. Would that being said, we've got so much to get to, but first let's start with our goof of the day. I was trying to think of a name of a last week, goof of the day. I like the idea when we do these top of the weeks to start it every time with a beautiful, great little video that we're all going to love goof of the day up first we've got laughter yoga, this video. I'm very conflicted about this video laughter yoga because,

Speaker 1:          00:02:41       well yeah, I'll just show you. It's like these people, they all have these awful diseases and their method of coping with it is by manic laughing. I get it. Like I think it's a cool thing, but it's like it's so eerie and strange. I mean, let me, let me, let's just start it off right here guys. Here we go.

Speaker 2:          00:03:06       God bless. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:03:13       diagnosis and we're going to laugh again. Yeah, and so you go around the room, it's very powerful. Now if you don't, and we'll do it just with a few people here just to get a flavor. If anybody has a diagnosis they want to share and laugh about that, that'd be great. And if you don't, then what I've done is combine it with the ha ha mantra, which is you'll say your name and what happened recently to you that normally would really bum you out and share it with us and we'll laugh at it. So it's that whole psychology of, you know, turning lemons.

Speaker 2:          00:03:48       Oops.

Speaker 3:          00:03:48       Was it into lemonade? Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:03:50       so you guys get it. This lady, by the way, where do you get that Eric? I think on face value it sounds nice, but when you watch it it's like I just don't buy the laughter. It's like the saddest shit I've ever seen.

Speaker 2:          00:04:06       Yeah.

Speaker 3:          00:04:06       So here's, I'll, and I always start and say, here's how it looks. So my name is Geeta.

Speaker 1:          00:04:16       The one thing that throws me off, it makes me feel strange about this is like why laughing after the name? It makes it seem like they're just clowning. Yeah. That was about trauma. Like they laugh, they laugh after they say the trauma, but then like they're like, hi, my name's Ethan. It's like, it feels like you're getting clowned on, you're going to see what I mean.

Speaker 2:          00:04:38       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:04:40       I Dunno.

Speaker 2:          00:04:41       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:04:48       your name for Christ's sake. You know what I mean? It's like, all right, something's not right.

Speaker 3:          00:04:59       And I was diagnosed with Parkinson's.

Speaker 2:          00:05:02       [inaudible].

Speaker 3:          00:05:14       Anybody else want to share

Speaker 1:          00:05:15       the idea? It's a strange, it's a strange thing, you know? Very strange. I get it. You know, I get it. It's a nice wholesome thing and they're trying to do here.

Speaker 2:          00:05:28       I just,

Speaker 1:          00:05:29       I dunno. It's so eerie. That's something so off about it. You'll see it get, it gets more obscene as they go along, but I don't get the whole very good. Very good. Yay. Like all of a sudden they're in kindergarten and it goes where they lost me to be honest. Yeah, you're kind of understand it. But then when the weird like cult chanting started it, it got pretty creepy,

Speaker 2:          00:05:52       right?

Speaker 3:          00:05:53       Error. Yes. My name is dawn

Speaker 1:          00:05:59       don. He took a shot. He took a shot. You know, he put his hand up in class. My name is Don. Why you got to goof while you got a clown on poor don? That's so weird. Or they laugh at their name.

Speaker 4:          00:06:17       I recently acquired insulin dependent diabetes.

Speaker 5:          00:06:22       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:06:24       Sorry. Not to see it like them just laughing at their misfortune. They're not, it just, I don't, I don't see them like embrace from my perspective, I just acquired insulin resistant diabetes. I Dunno. I just sounds like they're clowning on hysterical. That's the funniest Shit

Speaker 5:          00:06:46       I've heard all day.

Speaker 6:          00:06:54       Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:12       That's the funniest shit I've heard all year. This, this woman's eyes really lit up on that one. She's like, she's like, oh fuck. A more tragic to the more hilarious. My name's Vicky and um, I was, I was stranded and had to eat my own son to stay alive.

Speaker 2:          00:07:36       Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:07:58       okay.

Speaker 1:          00:07:58       There's like a real sadness, you know what I mean? It's like they're not acknowledged. I Dunno. What do I know? Healthy? No. Yeah, that's what I don't know. I don't know. Something about this seems so demented and I don't want to goof on these people because, you know, they're trying to cope with some difficult stuff. Just trying to an allen analyze how I feel about it. Let's see. Maybe the next one is just like straight up like,

Speaker 2:          00:08:25       you know,

Speaker 1:          00:08:28       my husband, I'm Dan and I murdered my son. Right. And I ate his corpse. Very good. Very good. Yay.

Speaker 1:          00:10:10       Do you need to leave? That doesn't qualify for Yoga. Laughter. By the way, she wasn't like, Oh, I'm overweight. I'm morbidly overweight. She's like, some people think the way people get the fuck

Speaker 6:          00:10:23       bill and you got crickets.

Speaker 2:          00:10:39       Damn.

Speaker 1:          00:10:42       Wouldn't be great if she was just like, you know what? Stop everyone. Stop laughing, bitch. Get Out.

Speaker 5:          00:10:52       [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          00:10:58       actually laughing now. She's like, this isn't laugh yoga. I'm laughing at you.

Speaker 6:          00:11:03       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:11:08       why would you need a group? Council did cause your, some people think you're overweight.

Speaker 4:          00:11:14       That's great. I have arthritis and diabetes.

Speaker 5:          00:11:27       Arthritis and diabetes. Give it up.

Speaker 4:          00:11:35       Yes. My name's Jim. Sometimes I get really scared about running out of money.

Speaker 5:          00:11:44       You,

Speaker 1:          00:11:45       you, you were. You're in a different room. Sometimes you get scared of running out of money. You and the fat lady need to go start your own laughter yoga. Okay.

Speaker 2:          00:11:57       What, what?

Speaker 1:          00:11:59       They don't need to worry, but you and everybody, dude. Huh? All right. I'm a chuckle at best. Eh, you don't deserve the laugh. If I'm being frank chuckle yoga anyway, I'm not sure how to make of all this stuff. It's like, I know they're, they're desperately trying to cope with really awful, unimaginable things, but it's like, it's just so eerie. It's strange to see these things side by side and I'm dying of breast cancer. Ah, yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:12:29       Anyway, I have one other goof of the day that I wanted to watch with you guys. Uh, the Pedo Lizard, the day, the, it's goofs of the day today, my friend. Wow. This, the story is that this video was used to be shown to middleschoolers back in the 90s to help inform them about, I guess this is one like the pedophile scare started when every random mail, specifically males was looking to abduct you. So this, this little short here was meant to educate the fine innocent young children of America. And to avoiding being taken. So here I give you the pedo hunting dinosaur. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:13:12       Hi Yellow Dano here,

Speaker 1:          00:13:15       Bro. I'm going to tell you straight up if there's any pedophile, it's in that fucking suit. Listen to that voice, man. I don't tell you what else. There's enough space in that suit for a man and a child like he could. He could be like clemen my suit. Young one.

Speaker 7:          00:13:33       Hi there. Whoa. Damn. You're about to see a show for parents and children about tricking people. Now if you're wondering who tricky people

Speaker 1:          00:13:43       people, that's a nice way to say child rapist.

Speaker 7:          00:13:47       Ah, well just put it bluntly. They're people who want to harm children.

Speaker 8:          00:13:52       Drink it, drink it, drink it, drink it. People everywhere you look it could,

Speaker 1:          00:13:56       well you're trying to fuck. And also what's wrong with you? Like why? Like this dinosaur character is just so strange. He's like, I look in everywhere. If there's rapists everywhere, it's like at a certain point, if you see them that frequently, you're looking too hard. Maybe you're looking, you need to look inward like this. Dinosaurs, there's a real true pat o'hare. I mean really, and it kind of,

Speaker 8:          00:14:24       my name is reginald charming. I put the show on here today. Cool. Did I just miss your mom

Speaker 1:          00:14:30       by the way? This is like the main villain was this name Reginald charming. Yeah, his last name charming. It's like these guys are fucking the guys who made this our, I swear to God, you'll have to touch kids to dream the shit up. Like you have to have at least have a couple of children and your slavery dungeon. The dream of this yellow jazz talking Dinosaur Anti Child Rape Superhero and the name of villain. Mr Charming. I'm mister charming.

Speaker 9:          00:15:01       Okay, so you use it on the little kids today. Something subtle like asking them, oh no, no, no, no, no. Wait, I've got some bumpy.

Speaker 1:          00:15:17       Why the fuck did they sound like Chris Rock? Oh No, not the old puppies in the car. He's fucking regional though to, he's like citizen justice. I don't know what they're advocating, but this guy hasn't raped any kids and you're loving you're, you're strong. Arming him against a wall man. Also, it's like such a Chris rock impersonation. It's tripping me out as a great shit. Imagine being in middle school and trying to extrapolate meaning from this. This is just so insane. Is he explicitly a dinosaur? I don't know what else he could be. Yeah, it's fucking weird. Maybe he's you. Did you see sin city where they chop off the pedals balls and he turns yellow? Maybe that's what this is. Oh Shit. This is like the devolution and he's a yellow man. Yeah, he's a castrated pedophile. Oh,

Speaker 9:          00:16:12       I'm an upstanding citizen

Speaker 1:          00:16:19       dude. This shit so fucked up. He tricks all these little girls and into doing a photo shoot for him and he's in there taking photos and look at it as creepy. A little friend like cheering them on and then at the end, which I'll show you the dinosaur breaks into his office to get the photos.

Speaker 1:          00:16:36       It's amazing. It was all a sting operation and the rest of the dinosaur you'll see there. There's a twist in between the lines, which I'd like you guys to watch your budget. There's a lot to unpack here and I'm really not sure. What's the meaning? I think the meaning is the lizards, the Pedo, every once the pedo trust. Nobody at all. Wow. This whole pedo hysteria. It's so strange. Like I don't know that there was this crazy pedo hysteria when I was this age. But these days it's like, don't, don't, uh, don't play outside by yourself or there's a hundred percent chance that someone's going to rape you immediately. It's like how many immediately you're innovating a rapist pedals are out there lurking. I don't know. It's never got show one of these when you were growing up though. No, cause I, not this one, but I explicitly remember the pedo video when I was like in elementary school, by the way.

Speaker 1:          00:17:25       We have the Dan Cam up. We do. Oh Great. How's it look? Well, I'm not on it right now. Oh, have you guys seen the Dan camp? We haven't used it yet. It's hit the Dan Cam. You're talking, it's, it's hard to explain, but if I'm just sitting here like an idiot like this and you're talking hit the damn camp, but then nobody's in the Dan Kim right now. Oh, you're not going to Dan Cam. Yeah, we've got Ian screening calls. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh my God. I know. All right, let me just play it. I'm going to cut to Dan Cameron. It's just an empty room. Alright. Um, I never, I was never shown any that's on the Dan Cameron. All right. Dan Camp. I was never shown any anything like this. You know, all you get is like a don't get in a car with strangers. I mean, what more do you need to know? Don't take, if some can't guys offering you candy, you know, don't let them put a finger in your ass unless it's like a full tootsie roll. Definitely not for like a little to zero. That's not worth the finger in the ass. No bite size bullshit. Full on like king size to cheer all you could basically put fit four fingers up my ass even today, frankly speaking. Good to know. It was a great, all right, well you got a tootsie roll.

Speaker 9:          00:18:31       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:18:31       I will later tonight you have a dinosaur costume. You want to role play?

Speaker 10:         00:18:35       Yeah. Oh my gosh. Your hands off her.

Speaker 1:          00:18:39       Oh by the way, his voice changes from, he goes from,

Speaker 9:          00:18:43       okay,

Speaker 1:          00:18:44       it goes from, uh, what's his name? Chris. Chris Rock. And he goes from Chris Rock that Bruce Willis. Real quick, man, get your hands off.

Speaker 2:          00:18:52       Washes. Take Lyrica is really, how did he change your race? His voice changed race. I thought that was why

Speaker 11:         00:19:14       I didn't do anything good out of my office.

Speaker 1:          00:19:16       I want Carmen's pictures. That's Ed. Looks like a nipple on my right. Fucking got him that record on the wall. So fucking nipple got them.

Speaker 11:         00:19:26       What are you talking about? Pictures. Oh my God. I don't know what Carmen told you, but there are no pictures. Give me the combination. Charming. Figure it out. You big stupid lizard. You think you're so smart? Well, you can't watch them all the time. Nobody can.

Speaker 9:          00:19:56       Cool.

Speaker 10:         00:19:57       Goodness takes off with the scare me. You're just jealous because of the kids liked me better than, than like you. Right? Maybe there's something to that. You hear me right?

Speaker 1:          00:20:12       So the question is

Speaker 10:         00:20:15       target

Speaker 1:          00:20:19       the photos, those that is not, that is not admissible evidence. So the question I have is where's he going with those photos? You know what I'm saying? You can't use those in court. You just barged in and stolen out of his safe. So what exactly is he doing with those photos? Yeah. I mean he didn't show up at the cops. He's just kind of this vigilante. You kicked in the doors, stole the child porn and he's going home. He's going straight home with that. Yeah. What the fuck? Just like Yo, share the fucking wealth man. I loved how dramatic that got that. Like Take Kiki and get outta here. Like looking over your shoulder. Yeah, man, he's going to go beat off to those photos. I've never been sure of anything more in my life.

Speaker 1:          00:21:13       So that's a weird one that, that really, I don't know. That threw me for a loop. That video. That was wild dude. They used to put kids in a, you know, auditorium, the whole class 500 people or whatever. I don't, yeah, and watch this. I mean, what I wish I had been shown that one, the one I was shown was super awkward and just serious. You know what I mean? Right. I did not have probably a better approach because I'm not sure I could extrapolate any means. Avoid yellow dinosaurs. Anyway, that's the goof of the day. I hope you guys had fun with that.

Speaker 12:         00:21:46       Give it up. Wasn't that a good time everybody? Well we are. We have, we have fun out here. They should.

Speaker 1:          00:21:53       Guest experience. Don't wait. We have a lot of fun here. Um, let's get onto the main stories. Logan. Paul. Wow. Who's ever talked about him. Am I right? Is that while there was this one tweet, I honestly couldn't let it go. I had to show it to you guys because it really was so insane. Um, that

Speaker 1:          00:22:17       even, even now I read it and I was just like, whoa. Right. He erased it after shortly after tweeting it because everyone was just like, wow, this is insane. So this is only from a couple of days ago. He says, and I quote board the plane, flight attendant gives me the old eyeball, up and down high socks, short shorts, saggy blonde hair. She shaggy, saggy tits picture. Perfect. Fuck boy. Give him my ticket first class stunned. He goes, oh wow. And points me to my seat. Don't judge a book by its cover. Wow. God, what a hero. There's, there's a lot to actually unpack here. I feel like, well, first of all, this never happened. Let's just establish this right off the bat. Bullshit. The only thing it's missing is everybody in the airplane standing up and applauding. Big applause. Yeah. Albert Einstein gave him that and the only thing that's missing is that flight attendant, Albert Einstein.

Speaker 1:          00:23:32       This never fucking happened, dude. At this point, you're like 24 there's no excuse for running this shit. This is like what a 12 year old fantasizes about. Then second of all, he acknowledges that he dresses like a fucking clown. High socks, shorts, shorts, shaggy, blonde hair picture. Perfect fuckboy picture. If you're a fuck, if you're going to sit there and acknowledge that you look like an idiot and that you're a fuckboy, let's just change your outfit. He's basically, you know what he's saying is I'm wearing all maverick shit to sell it to these kids, but I would never want to wear this because I look like a fuck boy. But I do like there's something in there, you know there's a weird motor come have a self awareness buried in there for sure. Like who is this flight attendant? This never seen a rich person who's apparently works first class, their flight attendant. Oh Wow. Oh my God, you're first class. Just imagine this person. I'm so sorry. Oh my God. Oh Wow. I am so sorry I judged you.

Speaker 9:          00:24:44       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:24:45       And then of course the subtle bragging about being rich and flying first class. But what exactly are you asking? Not to judge. There's no nothing about your character. He's saying don't, don't make a judgment if someone's a rich or poor.

Speaker 9:          00:25:03       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:03       Be careful who you're rude too because they might be rich. The fuck. What's the moral of the story, Logan? He's trying to bring awareness to the rampant persecution of fuck boys in this country that honestly is probably the biggest social issue that we have to deal with it. And not denying that he's a fuck boy. He's like, I'm a rich fuckboy and therefore you judged a book by its cover. It's like, dude, basically he's saying because he's wealthy, he's superior. I mean, that's really what's sewn in here.

Speaker 9:          00:25:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:25:40       And to that I say, and you are fucking, uh, really, uh, this is really one of the worst tweets I've ever read. And he always says, I'm a kid and he always has a 30 year old man and all that shit. He would call me at 33 year old man.

Speaker 1:          00:25:55       You're, that excuse is not, I mean, this is really probably the dumbest thing I've ever read by a public personality. How long did he keep this up before he was 30,000 likes? So I mean, probably half a day or more. Was he getting a bunch of shit for it? Like what? Yeah, I'm sure. How did he become self aware suddenly that that is fucking awful. Yeah. He was probably getting shit for it and he was, he's probably trying to play it like close to the hip these days, you know? Um, he's like, Ooh, I guess he's like, I don't understand why people don't like this, but I'm going to remove it because trying to keep it, you know, coach. But I have to say I, when I read this, I said stunned. I said, oh wow. And then you stood up and started applauding. Right. And then I did judge this book by its cover.

Speaker 1:          00:26:48       I was like, well no, they were right about you, dude. They weren't talking about the price. The fact that you are first class, they were talking about that you're such a douchebag. They saw this, they saw him, they knew it was Logan Paul. And they're like, Oh wow, this guy's a fucking idiot. And then Logan's like, excuse me, I'm first class. And they're like, yeah, you're still, you're, that's exactly what I expected. You're a fucking idiot. This is a Marv. I must want to frame this. You know what I mean? We should wait. What is a picture? Perfect fuck boy. By the way. Oh, when you, when you had done that self image. We don't make someone aware, but it's only got a negative connotation. You don't know what a picture. Perfect. Fuck boys. It's high socks, shorts, shorts, shaggy blonde hair. Right, right. Basically describing and laying it out.

Speaker 1:          00:27:33       Right. He's a pimp or picture. Perfect. Fuck. But I love it. I want to frame, this is the dumbest thing I've ever read. I mean, genuinely, I've always, I've reserved judgment for him and I'm like, he's smart. Like he's old. He's young, he's reckless, he's crazy. But he's, he's smart. No, no. The verdict's out. This book has been read. The covers flipped this books read. We're not judging it by the cover. Logan. We've read the fucking book. It's a bad book. It's a shitty buck dead. It's, it's frankly this book and I think you'll agree it's in the bargain bin. You can buy this book for like $2 on sale right now. Kmart. Yeah. It couldn't even get it into a walmart. It's just kmart. This is in the bar. This, this book is frankly on sale at a salvation army right now for 50 cents.

Speaker 1:          00:28:25       Yeah. We've read the book. Well, anyway, I want to talk about the press conference he had with Ksi. And again, I don't want to talk about everything pillow and Paul does, but this stuff is so good and I got to say, well, let's take a break. We'll talk about it when we get back. We've got the press conference to talk about. We've got BBC had an interview scheduled for him today to promote his fight with KSI that they canceled. They said it wasn't a good interview. That canceled. I love that, that and so, so, so much more. And of course know your meme. Don't go anywhere guys. We will be right back.

Speaker 1:          00:36:25       Alrighty, we are back. Thanks for sticking around. So he's on firstclass. He's going somewhere clearly. Where's he going? I think I know where he's going. Follow the lead. I've got it all tracked out. The press conference with CSI, CSI. Jesus. Ksi sound like an old man. Um, who's this CSI guy? Yeah, exactly. So Ksi Logan. Paul, you guys all know about this boxing match. I'm not going to lie. I'm going to watch the highlights. I'm not going to sit here in front. Like what? Like I'm not even interested on aunt. I'm going to watch the highlights. I'm watching it. I actually, I think this side is going to, I think Ksi will win, but I am standing by that I think is going to be a shitty, boring match ever since I heard. So they're doing two, one in the UK and one back here in La and they always arrange for it to do too. I feel like it's, it's all bogus. Like one is going to win one and the other is going to win the other. Ah, I don't think, I don't what you're, you're saying that someone's going to throw it? Yeah, I'm not going full conspiracy, man. I don't think it's legit. I don't think either of them have neither have, they both have such huge egos. I don't think either of them have it and them to get their ass beat and throw.

Speaker 1:          00:37:45       I don't see it. Hmm. But if there's like a slaughter and the first one, I mean, I have no reason to believe it's weird to have. Well anyway, whatever. Let's watch his fucking video could sit here and analyze this all. It's just a bunch of fucking youtube or xbox it like, it's retard. Like the concept is just so stupid. They're gonna make so much money. Dude,

Speaker 13:         00:38:04       hold onto the stage.

Speaker 1:          00:38:07       Anyway, watching this video, I actually start to feel bad for Logan Paul in a way. He's just, he gets,

Speaker 13:         00:38:17       he's the heel. He just can't go wrestling hill. So embarrassing.

Speaker 1:          00:38:21       Like he just gets creamed by case. I then Logan's Logan's dad of all people come out and try to defend him. It's like, Dude, his dad is crunchy as fuck and it's just like a shit show. It's just so embarrassing. You know what Logan's thinking? He's like, dude, this is my, this may well be my last chance to make money.

Speaker 9:          00:38:44       Okay,

Speaker 1:          00:38:45       so I'm going to ignore this. I wonder how much they both making from this. I want to crunch some numbers right now. Let's crunch numbers. I think there's 20,000 seats. I don't think they're going to sell it. I think maybe they'll sell. Let's be generous and say they sell 10,000 seats. Okay. 10,000. Let's say it's 100 on average per ticket. And they get let's, let's just do revenue right now. Okay. There wasn't charging a hundred fucking dollars. I can do this thing. Yeah, she's, so that's a million. But then they're doing paper view and all this bullshit. They'll have a lot of live streamers. I know. How many, how many paper view tickets can they sell this? I don't know. Not that much. 10,000. I mean, I don't know. Right

Speaker 1:          00:39:30       for the online, isn't it online thing? Yeah, it's a online page charging for that too. Wow. Um, they'll still more than 10,000, let's say it's 25 for the stream. So what do you think they sell? I mean, I, okay, let's say 50 that seems generous, but maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's a hundred I don't know. 50,000 that's another, I mean, you're looking at 2 million. Not Bad for the venue gets half. You're down to a million split between the two of them. I feel like this calculation can't be right. I feel like they got to be making more money from this. You know, it's $14 for an online ticket. It looks like dude, they're fucking not making that much money from this. He's humiliating himself for like a hundred I mean, maybe I'm out of touch a little bit. Most people are like, dude, I would eat my own shit for $100,000 and you're right.

Speaker 1:          00:40:24       But like Mcgregor, like mayweather got paid 300 million fucking dollars or something. How much should he get for that fight? I don't know. Look it up. I'm sure it's somewhere around there. Like so you know, in comparison, which is what they're trying to do regardless is washes. I am very curious how much money they're, they're, they're, you know, about to make from it. If you can look that up, let me know, Dan. Yeah, I just pulled it up. 300 million for mayweather and conor Mcgregor. Hundred around a hundred million. I don't know. Fuck. Is there that much money in a single fight? The fighters alone got $400 million. What am I missing? Well, okay, well what I'm missing is that that was like the fight of the century and probably like a million plus people bought the paper view, right? Yeah. I mean it's two legends, you know? Uh, KSI and Logan Paul. I mean they're legends. Bit of a, of a different, gosh, I'm really care. I don't see that many people buying the paper view because everyone is just going to want to watch the highlights. Just don't. H three h three a live reaction stream built leg there. Bootleg tape review. That might be illegal. Come at me fuckers. No, I'm not

Speaker 9:          00:41:49       right

Speaker 13:         00:41:51       this dick again. Yeah. You already did this dad. Dude, come on the fuck off. Oh, you know what?

Speaker 1:          00:42:07       Let me just skip to the good parts, which is basically he shits on him. He shits on em.

Speaker 13:         00:42:15       Let's go. Let's go. Let's all doors. Fuck. I really liked when his dad gets involved. You see everyone has, everyone has my back.

Speaker 9:          00:42:29       Yeah,

Speaker 1:          00:42:41       His Dad is there on stage. Why is your dad there? Doug? You're trying to look bad ass. Don't bring your fucking dad. Who makes out with little girls? Yeah, I was about to say this is the same dad that they got the keys. He's like, you know what? It'd be bad ass at this press conference. My Dad don't judge a book by its cover. You fucking peasant ass. Stewardist you know what's funny about Logan Paul? He probably buys his data coach ticket cause they come here as like an entourage. You know Logan Paul is the kind of dude who would buy himself a first class ticket in his dad's and coach. Listen Dad, you're not, you're not a firstclass fuck boy like me. All right, you got to run this and dad, the entourage is pretty big. I'm going to have to stick you in coach. All the way back next to the bathroom. Don't judge a book by its cover, Dude. Don't you have a job? How was this his, how was his dad turned into his hype? Man, don't you have a job?

Speaker 9:          00:43:39       Okay.

Speaker 1:          00:43:40       He's like, my son is really famous. I'm going to ride his coattails and kiss as many little 16 year olds as possible. His Dad is like all in like he's Logan Paul's dad now. Like he walks around and people are like, Oh, you're that guy that makes up a little girls and Jake Paul's channel. Yeah. Anyway,

No, but his dad's got his fucking back. Yeah. His Dad's got his back through thick and thin for sure. And then on top of it, BBC was at an interview with Logan to promote the fight and they tweeted this out today. We were going to hear from Logan, Paul and Ksi on their boxing match tonight after listening back to the interview. And we don't feel it's right. We understand some of your strong views on Logan, but ultimately we don't, if we don't think the interview is good enough, we don't air it. They thought the interview, they're like, it's not about that. You guys don't like Logan. It's about that the interview sucked that this guy at nothing interesting to say. And so we didn't air it like this is the best burn ever. That like we acknowledge that we all hate him and that's not why we aired it. We aired it because it sucked. Dick, it's pretty brutal man. He would be a killer realtor though. He could probably, yeah, he would be killed realtor. I buy the trailer parks from him. All right, well, um, guys, it's about that time for an episode of I to sneeze. Oh God.

Speaker 1:          00:55:05       Excellent. I got to say that shocked me when I heard he had kissed 49 cuties. I was like, damn, skippy is fucking like crazy. Like if he wasn't a mormon, he would be like probably have stds still mag. Would you get skippy?

Speaker 9:          00:55:24       Okay.

Speaker 15:         00:55:25       Uh, I would give that a soft. Maybe

Speaker 1:          00:55:28       you give him a peck. Hmm. Yeah. You give them a soft, what does that mean? Like a soft kiss?

Speaker 9:          00:55:34       Yeah.

Speaker 15:         00:55:35       Uh, I, it would be like a, I feel sorry for you a little bit. We can't make it to the next stage. Not the type. Who's your consolation prize?

Speaker 1:          00:55:42       Do you, are you attracted to men who picked belly button lint out of their stomach and keep it in a jar by their bed?

Speaker 15:         00:55:50       No, I would have to say probably not.

Speaker 1:          00:55:52       Well, I find that a little bit judgmental, Sarah, but, but you are your own person and I don't judge you. You've got one point on the board. Hey, so excellent. Here we go. Question number three, what's the furthest Bay skippy has gotten too?

Speaker 9:          00:56:11       Hey,

Speaker 1:          00:56:12       second and a half. In other words, he's, he's fingered girls and he's got his dick touched as well.

Speaker 9:          00:56:19       Oh,

Speaker 1:          00:56:21       third base

Speaker 11:         00:56:23       oral or first base, which is, you know, just a peck. He seem to know a lot about. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          00:56:29       Okay. I hear you describing the basis, the basis. Um, I think it's a, I think it's a,

Speaker 11:         00:56:37       you sound confident. No hesitation. Nope. Zero hesitation. Knocking around the skippy knowledge. Wow. You're good. Well,

Speaker 15:         00:56:49       I like to, I liked when the music gets tense. I feel like you're not giving me a chance. Like, you know, you got to let the tension build. You're too confident. You're too quiet. Oh my bad. Okay. I'll wait for the next one. Nobody. You could be yourself but also don't be yourself to make the show better, Dan. The answer is

Speaker 12:         00:57:09       done. Well, let's just put it there.

Speaker 1:          00:57:12       Okay. I was going between second and third, but I ended up getting tagged out by the sheriff. Stopped. I'd been touched in the side

Speaker 12:         00:57:20       but haven't quite gotten the fat where mountains on body parts had gotten her. I get it. I guess I have

Speaker 1:          00:57:30       the say your knowledge of skippy. You got your all, you've got two points on the board. I may give it up,

Speaker 12:         00:57:36       man. It's the second he must say that because you haven't mentioned this, that yeah, you knew right away. Uh,

Speaker 1:          00:57:43       I may or may not have brushed up on my skippy knowledge. Oh, you're an advanced player. I, I definitely tip my beanie to you now. He said he's gotten that second and a half base. If you had to imagine, what do you think that would necessarily mean? Uh, like his dick out a little bit wet, but not crazy way. Little like a little kiss, like a little kid. Interesting. A little bit kiss here. Can I do a, uh, can I do, there's gotta be a sound effect for that.

Speaker 12:         00:58:18       Yeah, I imagine you're right. Probably got a little bit wet and to that I said once again,

Speaker 1:          00:58:23       skip that you really surprising me. If it wasn't for this a little warming thing, he would just be fucking like crazy. He's crushing it honestly. I know. I love the image of him being stopped between bases. Like he got, he got tagged out. He was in, he's having a pickle and probably came downstairs. Yeah, that might be actually accurate. What happened?

Speaker 12:         00:58:44       Your left. All right. Just once for all the tamales.

Speaker 11:         00:58:55       Oh Man. What's the most trouble skips trouble skippy has ever gotten with his bishop? We've taught, heard him talk about his bishop. This is the man at his church who passes judgment on him. He's basically the gatekeeper to the afterlife. Right, right. So a,

Speaker 1:          00:59:18       um, he got in trouble for all the handies he's been getting

Speaker 2:          00:59:21       no,

Speaker 11:         00:59:22       as we, as we've called it, rounding the third base, but being struck out for masturbating too much or see getting drunk, which is strictly against the Mormon faith. Sarah,

Speaker 15:         00:59:39       what is your oh boy. I think deeply and the mind of the Mormon enter the mind of the virgin. I would say it's probably masturbating, masturbating too much.

Speaker 16:         00:59:58       Very nice and very, very good gas. I would guess that he masturbates at least seven times a day at least.

Speaker 5:          01:00:10       Dan,

Speaker 16:         01:00:12       is it masturbating too much, John

Speaker 14:         01:00:14       to second base with multiple girls? I got if we're using the baseball analogy, I uh, got sidelined by my bishop and was told not to take the communion for awhile. So in the Mormon church they call it being disfellowshipped.

Speaker 1:          01:00:33       This fella

Speaker 15:         01:00:34       shipped. It is sadly, he had a great, great guess. You had a great guess. He probably does masturbate a lot to that. I would give you all the credit,

Speaker 1:          01:00:45       but it was actually from all the handies he was getting and he got disfellowshipped, which is a word that makes me giggle. Um, I love it. But this is okay. This last question. Everything rides on this question. It's two to two. This is, we are on the board to, to, to the tents. Music is on now. Sarah,

Speaker 11:         01:01:06       what kind of phone are you using currently?

Speaker 14:         01:01:09       I am using a Google Pixel that has a very craft screen.

Speaker 11:         01:01:13       Oh, so this is, this has been, because this is big. Let me tell you what's on the line here. Okay. This is a brand new s nine plus. This is the best phone on the market. There's no question about it. And let me tell you what else. What else do you think it has my dna on it. Ooh, don't clone you. Terrific. Okay, I won't. Sorry. 35 okay, here we go. The question to decide at all

Speaker 15:         01:01:47       what?

Speaker 5:          01:01:47       Ooh,

Speaker 15:         01:01:50       what kind of collection did skippy give us? The auction for charity. Was it a toe nail clippings be eyelashes or see belly button.

Speaker 16:         01:02:03       It was definitely fee and smelled like your grandmother's closet here and one of the cooler things I get that I did. I was, I was drawing it out. I didn't say go. I played it early. Dan, you heard the drama. You play it. The symbol. Do you, when you hear this my entire life, don't you play when you did the symbol? I'm not. I'm describing. I did. Don't get technical. You know what I mean? That doesn't mean play. I'm just telling you when I hit that. All right. Yeah. What is the answer? One of the cooler

Speaker 14:         01:02:42       planes that ever happened in my entire life was when my belly button link collection of almost 20 years was given to h three h three

Speaker 10:         01:02:58       what's the greatest, greatest fall on the market? How are you feeling right now? I am so excited. Oh, I'm happy to hear that. Do you have anyone that you want to think? Uh, I'd like to think it's my baby girl for sleeping during this entire process. God bless her. God bless her. What a sweet Angela.

Speaker 1:          01:03:20       Oh, Dan told him to kill the music. I guess that was not really that great. It's just a little louder. Um, Sarah, you're the greatest. You don't want a new phone. Stay on the line. We're going to hook you up. Thank you for calling in and God will look good. Yep. Thank you. Yep. Appreciate Ya. All right, Papa. Bless Papa. Bless. Do I need to mute her? Something down? Yeah, just put her, uh, don't, don't, don't take this personally, Sarah, but I get it. You're muted. Shut up Dan. You got it. I'm doing, I'm doing drum out here. I know I milk. I'm doing drama. You can't just be, you can't willy nilly just play sound whenever you want. Oh, unbelievable.

Speaker 16:         01:04:02       You hear this? That's drama. I didn't hit the center of the civil. Where'd the money went for hurricane relief? I hear the symbol, right.

Speaker 1:          01:04:09       Play. Not Kidding, dude. Anyway. That was fun. That was a good time. Sarah was a great color. There was a great guy. I love this. I love this segment. It's so much fun that my dna on it send any into uh, get her info. I was great. And that was so much fun. Who should we do next? I wonder. So we actually, this show is, uh, let's just do the Roseanne. I mean I've got a lot of great stuff here, but I kind of want to go over it with, with Ila. Um, one thing in particular I really want to talk about is that we talked previously that mean either trying to have kids. So I want to do a semen analysis and I was, it was, the room was unbelievable where you going there and squirting a cup. I was taking pictures and videos of this room because it's like you can't imagine what's going on in there, but I want to wait until Ila sitting across from me so she can, you need to see her reaction to this. So there's a lot of stuff I want to talk about, but I want to close up the show with Roseanne. You guys have heard about Roseanne, the situation of her calling. I don't remember if this lady, she said she looked like a monkey. Shar show got canceled. So she's finally issued an explanation. She's finally issued a statement, an apology of sorts that I think clears everything up. And I think you guys will all agree. So in her own words.

Speaker 3:          01:05:42       Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello.

Speaker 1:          01:05:46       Is it loud enough out there, Dan? I don't want to hear. Yeah, no, it's fine. Cause it only she's Mike. Everybody else is just getting ambient. So once she starts talking and listen.

Speaker 3:          01:05:57       All right. All right.

Speaker 1:          01:06:02       I get frustrated with Dan. We have sound issues and I yell at Dan, you guys have any sound issues with the unbalanced or itchy weird shit? Emailed Dan and give him, give him hell.

Speaker 2:          01:06:13       Okay.

Speaker 1:          01:06:15       Sounds good. We don't have chat anymore, so we don't even know for fucking up anymore. By the way, this figurine and another video, she explains that this is a statue of her body. Oh, maybe skippy's into that. Maybe. Maybe d Roseanne would be, that kind of surprises me that skippy wants to fuck oprah does. I know the figurine with your mouse. I just took it full screen right here. Yeah, there she is. Does it surprise you that skippy wants to fuck oprah? I mean that's kind of cool. He's like, Damn, you know what? I want to fucking, you know who I want around third base on Oprah. I wonder what's very surprised when he said that. What base is ass play? Cause that then that's the dugout. The metaphor kind of breaks down cause it's like ask plays almost more advanced than a home run in a way. In most circles. Anyway. So I wonder if skippy's ever fingered an asshole. I don't wonder that. Why do I hear him talking in the background? I was that Ian, that must be in through your mic. All right, look at Sarah's info. Okay. All right. Well anyway, as digression in her own words, here's Roseanne explaining.

Speaker 3:          01:07:34       Okay. How's it sound? I don't know. Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello, hello, hello. Okay. And you said I'm in three outfits or niche. Here's the problem, like imagine, are you filming? Yes. Imagine a presidential address. Like you're busted with a killing a hooker, like just no hear me out. And they say tonight the president is going to give his address and then the camera fades out and it's fucking the president on his desk in the Oval Office. And he's like, I do not have sex with that hooker. Right. Um, imagine in his statement the keep and save his job. There were jump cuts, multiple outfits,

Speaker 5:          01:08:16       difference. I'm trying to talk about, you've told me this $300. Do you know that? That's what my tweet was about. I know you've explained this literally was why I thought the bridge was why.

Speaker 1:          01:08:38       So that clears it up.

Speaker 5:          01:08:41       Wow.

Speaker 1:          01:08:43       So there's like, there's a lot of interesting things here about this field. First of all, this is on her, this is on her official youtube channel. This was uploaded by her, her directly deliver on the Dan Barker Channel. Let's see. Anyway, this is probably my favorite clip to come out of this whole possibly year 2018 this might be the strongest clip of the whole year. Roseanne, what do you have to say in your defense

Speaker 5:          01:09:13       job? There were jump cuts. You've told me this 300 times.

Speaker 1:          01:09:21       What is wrong with her? She's like, I don't think she's on drugs, but like my God, she's like breaking down just like Christ. He doesn't look good. This was posted this this previous week, right? This is very recent. You think it was recorded recently or was this right after the incident? No, no, no. This is, maybe this is, this is after some thoughtful after some reflection, but like the question is, well here after some after, I love this. This is so good. After some careful consideration and some thoughtful reflection, Rosanne has decided to issue a statement on her controversial tweets.

Speaker 5:          01:10:01       That's what my point was about. I know you've explained this. Literally. That was why I thought the bridge was why.

Speaker 1:          01:10:15       Now I've got an interesting question for you. Do you think this in a way, does this help her? No. Okay. Why? Almost? I'm more inclined to believe her because she's like, she's very passionate about, she's very passionate about it or I'm, I'm somewhat inclined to believe that, um, that it, it wasn't necessarily coming from a place of,

Speaker 5:          01:10:38       he's done

Speaker 1:          01:10:38       prove that statement. That's a strong statement. However, I'm also inclined to believe that she's a fucking psycho.

Speaker 5:          01:10:45       What makes you think that? What makes you say at all, Dan? Dan,

Speaker 1:          01:10:55       I don't know. Just something, something, something about, well, and she goes about it. I don't know. Anyway, guys, um, you know, I just thought that there's really a lot of value here. I thought this was a great clip and I thought, well, let me, let me, let me draft this in a, in another way.

Speaker 5:          01:11:31       Why?

Speaker 1:          01:11:36       And for those reasons, amount. I've been waiting, I do that for a long time. I got this soundbite here is I have another one. The angels in heaven.

Speaker 2:          01:11:44       Oh,

Speaker 1:          01:11:57       I think the curb ones better.

Speaker 5:          01:12:05       Why?

Speaker 1:          01:12:13       I love that soundboard. Oh, you're a conductor, dude. I feel like, I feel like a Dj for the first time. Yeah. But here actually, this is fine. This is like right when they start rolling. That was like her off the cuff thing. Have you ever seen someone famous so unhinged in your life? I think it, what's so fascinating about it?

Speaker 17:         01:12:34       I thought that bitch was, why

Speaker 1:          01:12:38       does that, whoa. All right. It's crazy to see anybody that unhinged, but it does kind of give you an insight to how, how fucked up he is kind of in a way. It's like Whoa, probably shouldn't have been working on that show to begin with, you know?

Speaker 17:         01:12:54       Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:12:55       That's where you're at mentally. You know what I'm saying?

Speaker 17:         01:12:59       I thought that was wow. It was why

Speaker 1:          01:13:06       God damn fucking open a portal. That shit. It's kind of what that is, isn't it? Um, but so then take too, she gets her shit together by the way. What the fuck are they put that on our official channel, man, I just loved that so much. So this is her actual, you know, real statement on it

Speaker 17:         01:13:24       bar. And I'd like to welcome you to my own studio, to my fellow and sister Americans without the filter of the biased media. That's my statement from the very beginning. And it will continue to be one abc called and asked me to explain my gray, just an unforgettable tweet. I told them I thought Valerie Jarrett was white and I'm willing to go on the BW, Jimmy Kimmel or whatever other show you want me to go on to my audience. Now what happened with about 40 minutes after that, my show was canceled before even one advertiser pulled out and I was labeled a racist. Why you ask? Well, the answer is simple. It's because I voted for Donald Trump and that is not allowed in Hollywood.

Speaker 1:          01:14:27       Pretty Shitty. Well, okay, so ma'am, well first of all wasn't the whole premise of the show that she was like a trump voter and like so clearly, obviously not that they get away, they gave you the show because you were a trump supporter because they thought it was an interesting dynamic. Right. So that doesn't make sense. Although I do, I actually do believe that she thought she was white because I've seen a picture and the lady doesn't, she my first guest wouldn't be black. And I mean if you can elicit, yeah,

Speaker 17:         01:14:55       this response was, why?

Speaker 1:          01:14:59       That's, but at any rate, she's, I don't know if let's say, let's say if she did think she was white, then is the tweet and like, how bad is the tweet still? You know what I mean? Yeah. I mean, obviously it doesn't have the whole connotation of calling a black person a monkey that everyone thought it did. So it's not as bad. Like the context does help, but it's still, she's unhinged it, she, she, she was probably on thin ice already at the end of the executives at ABC because she'd just nonstop was ranting on twitter about it. Okay.

Speaker 17:         01:15:36       Nine Times.

Speaker 1:          01:15:38       Right. And can you imagine working with that? I mean, I'm sure that's not an isolated incident. Yeah. I actually, I think what happened, I'm like you said, it's probably that they were like, all right, like, enough, this is Nikki. Yeah. This, this is not going to get better. But see, I mean, just to kind of line that up in a way,

Speaker 3:          01:15:58       how did you,

Speaker 2:          01:16:00       MMM,

Speaker 1:          01:16:01       here's a clip again, this is all on our personal youtube channel, which is just so fascinating to me. But, um, here, here, here's a little soundbite they uploaded right before they started shooting the first season of her new

Speaker 3:          01:16:17       shut. How did you, you're so fucking tired. How did you do this for 10 years? Are you shitting me? I lost my fucking mind. I lost my marriage. I had locked my phone. The kids drop our marriage and get wad and a fucking half and one bro. The fuck do you think both at the hospitalized for four different nervous breakdown? That's how I did it. Thanks for asking.

Speaker 1:          01:16:41       That's actually great. It's pretty wild, man. She's a fucking character. You know what, Rosanne, she's such a,

Speaker 17:         01:16:47       I thought that was why.

Speaker 1:          01:16:52       I Dunno. I Dunno. It's so hard to say, you know, with the, sorry to say, but either way, we've got this wonderful sound bite that I think will truly live in infamy. I don't see this going anywhere off my soundboard for a while.

Speaker 17:         01:17:05       That was why

Speaker 1:          01:17:08       so good. Um,

Speaker 18:         01:17:10       like I said, let's see what else we've got here. We've got a, we've got all this stuff. We've got some great shit. I'm gonna save this though. We've got the news. We should just hit the news if the news, but before we do hit the news, we're going to bring back the news by the way, but before we do,

Speaker 5:          01:17:33       hi.

Speaker 18:         01:17:40       All right. Maybe it's just me having fun. There's a possibility that there's thousands of people watching right now and saying, please stop fucking doing that. I'm having a great time though. All right, Dan, give us the news. All right. Hit Him with the Stinger.

Speaker 5:          01:17:58       Oh God.

Speaker 18:         01:18:16       All right, let's do the news. Everybody. You got to flip your TV. It's rather a input by the way, so you can follow along. Right? Right. All right, so, um, top story today, come into us from a CNBC here. Um, I'm sure, uh, a lot of people heard about this facebook at work pc, or is it hd? Mine? Itchy my too. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Hello. It's fucking, oh my God. There you go. All right. Hey. All right. So, uh, yeah, top store. We got a facebook loses $100 billion plus in market cap.

Speaker 5:          01:19:03       Wow. This past week,

Speaker 18:         01:19:06       uh, their shares plunged a on Thursday, uh, or I guess it was Wednesday after hours, uh, by 20%, um, which it was in response to them announcing that they're, they're going to up their spending on privacy concerns and fighting fake news on the platform. People were like, fuck that. I want that rush of money rights. Um, and I, I guess it, it, it basically is more so about they're going to be spending a ton of money to do this. Um, and that kind of coupled with the fact that I guess their user growth has really slowed down. Surprise, surprise. Facebook fucking sucks. Nobody wants to sign up anymore. And so it's just kind of created this perfect storm where, yeah, in a single night, $100 billion disappeared off the market. Single biggest loss for a company. Right? The single biggest loss. However, um, and just to give some perspective number two, uh, I looked this up on September 22nd the year 2000 Intel lost 90 billion, so about 18 years ago. And that was, you know, the.com crash. That happened at the end of the nineties.

Speaker 1:          01:20:08       Well, sort of results. What I'd like to say is suck my Dick facebook. Fuck you, mark Zuckerberg. Fuck you. Facebook. I cannot wait for facebook to become the next my space. I'm very, I've said this all the time, but I hate everything about facebook and I'm so fucking glad. By the way I read a report, they're like their earnings from them stealing content from where everywhere else on the internet, like the earnings aren't good and the engagement isn't good. And all I have to say is for those reasons I'm out. Fuck you, facebook. I am so glad to see that website die. Well, maybe don't get too excited yet because apparently they were up 20% this year, so they're basically just back to where they were a few months ago. Well, let's see it. Let's, let's wash his baby slide. Yeah, we'll see what happens. What else you got in the news, Dan?

Speaker 1:          01:21:01       All right, so next up, um, uh, Papa John. Oh No, Papa John. Um, we talked about this a couple of weeks ago or last week and not, not having a great month. I'm having a great July. Um, Papa John, the man is now suing Papa John the company. Um, no, he's going after him. John Shatner civil war and it's the civil war. It's the pizza wars and I'm, no, the pizza wars are upon us. When Papa John Fights Papa John, you know who wins? Nobody. Little seizures. Oh yeah, you're right. You're right. Oh, I love this description. Shatner has admitted to, as he said, the n word on a conference call with a marketing firm. Shatner claimed the firm asked if he was racist. Listen, are you racist then use the n word inscribing house KFC is Colonel Sanders used to talk chat and has since also said that he told the firm that he himself wouldn't ever use that word after having used the word right.

Speaker 1:          01:21:59       Which is kind of the confusing part of this whole thing is he's like acknowledging that he said it, but also denying that he said it in the Sweden. I've always, when I, when I saw that headline and then I read the article, I was like, well again, I do think there needs to be a disc. Like I haven't, we all fucking kind of lost our minds a little bit. I mean, he shouldn't have said it. That's for sure. If a marketing company asks, are you racist? Don't drop the n bomb this show how not racist you are. Which is basically what he did. But like he didn't like use the, he didn't weaponize the word, he didn't use the word he was talking about the word. Right. You know what I mean? Like the headlines Bra, the drug drops to Ed on the conference call and you're like, whoa. Like he just like called someone the n word or somewhat not exactly what happened, but I mean, you know, Papa John, he's sliding that guy spent, he spent way too much time close to a pizza oven. His face is like melting off like that Mozzarella cheese is like, it's in the pores and men that pizza is ready to, you can't that pizza

Speaker 18:         01:23:06       that peet's has been baked too may time. So, yeah, so he's going after them, uh, saying that, you know, he was unfairly forced out as the, uh, head and I guess he's, I thought he was out completely. I guess it was just that he was forced out as the chairman. He still owns 29% of the company while he was on the board of directors and then they booted him. Right. And so he, he's still got his, his claws in it a little bit. Um, but they're, they're trying real hard to get rid of him. I love his papa John who is the man. You mean pop a boner

Speaker 1:          01:23:39       and usurp power. You've got that meme. I saw this man, man. I really think the y'all, yeah, this kind of says it all. You can't trust anybody. Even yourself. What happens when Papa John Tries to execute? Papa John's thought provoking.

Speaker 18:         01:24:01       Really. It Dan, what's next? Some deep stuff. All right. Uh, let's see. What is next. Oh, this is really cool. Um, so this week a, a team of Italian researchers announced that after analyzing some data for the last two years, they are saying with a high degree of confidence that they have discovered a lake of water on Mars. Um, it is under the southern polar cap. And I guess this is very similar. Um, the reason they knew to look for this specific thing is, um, there's these kinds of lakes in an class here on earth in a very similar fashion. And so they were using, there's this European, a space mission called the Mars Express orbiter that was able to use ground penetrating radar and they detected a what looked like a lake, but they weren't sure. Um, but again, after a analyzing this for the last two years, they with a high degree of confidence are able to say this is a wow 20 kilometer wide lake sitting, uh, an amateur and a half under the ice cap. Any estimate when we can get anything up there to do some digging? Yeah. So I mean that's the problem. It's, it's, that's still a ways off, uh, just because of the weight of all the equipment you would need. I mean, you need a drill that can go almost a mile straight,

Speaker 1:          01:25:17       thrilling when we can cut into that ice. Like if they find like there's two options or there's three options, really. One option is that they find life that is identical and DNA to ours, which could mean that life originated on Mars. Right. And then like a meteor impact or something she sperm did onto earth. And then the second option is that it's different. Completely different. The third options, there's nothing there. They're all fascinating and their own right. The craziest one for me would be like, if it's completely a different origin of life, sure. But if you do find life, I feel like the most likely would be that it's the same Dna, I feel like. Yeah.

Speaker 18:         01:26:02       And I think you're though that if it were completely different from life on earth, that that won't be the coolest thing because that just shows. Okay. So it developed completely independently on two planets in the solar system. That means it's everywhere. How much you'd like to see. Another alien life form that has a completely different building blocks would be late discovery of, of the life. I can, I cannot wait for that. That's so cool. God bless. Really awesome. Really awesome stuff. So good job. Good job. Italy. [inaudible] killing it over there. Uh, next up. Uh, so I don't know if everybody, I'm sure everybody's heard about this. So James Gunn got fired from, uh, the guardians of the galaxy three. Um, because, uh, some old tweets got dug up from about 10 years ago of him making some pretty, pretty distasteful. What was, what was the joke you have if you have an example?

Speaker 18:         01:26:59       So I have one example. Uh, and in the words of the article, this is from entertainment weekly. Uh, this was one of the only ones that could reprint. So I can only imagine the rest were pretty bad too. This one, uh, was laughter is the best medicine. That's why I laugh at people with AIDS. Oh, fucking cares. That's not that. You know, seriously. Yeah. Yep. Now they did say this again. This is potentially one of the least find, find the worst one. They've all been, they've all been scrubbed at this. Come on. They're out there on that. I'm sure they're out there. They're out there. Um, and fine. Let's, let's see. You know, that's not bad. Let's see what's, yeah, I mean, that's, that's not the worst, but here's the whole, you know, you're looking in switching the, uh, the computer. Fuck, he's in the hot seat right here though.

Speaker 18:         01:27:46       You can find them. I'm googling it was on it. Okay. Um, so basically what this all is, is, uh, you know, James Gunn, he's pretty outspoken critic of trump and, um, some this right wing group that didn't like that he was talking all this shit, uh, decided to kind of troll through all of his old tweets and everything. And yeah, I mean, I guess James Gunn has been on twitter forever, and so there was thousands and thousands of these things and James Gunn, if anybody knows anything about James Gunn, he, he, he's an edgy dude like that. Everything before doing the guardians of the galaxy movies that he's ever done was pretty Raunchy. What's the, uh, what's the headline? So the headline is there's a campaign to get him, um, to get him rehired that it was bullshit that they fired him. And, and you know the fans, they, they love the guardians movies.

Speaker 18:         01:28:40       They think he's done a good job. They don't care and they want them back end. Um, as of yesterday, 300,000 signatures in a matter of, I think two or three days. So Disney's, that's like, you have found a, Oh yeah, let's hear it. Give me more. Give me the most cause that, that wouldn't have got him fired. All right, so here's an I like when little boys touch me in my silly place. Another thing that's pretty cringy. I mean, that's the thing. None of these are even really that sexy. It's really not funny at all. The best thing about being raped is when you're done being raped and it's like, whew, this feels great not being raped. God, can you imagine tweeting that? It's like so embarrassing. Well, and he's embarrassed. I mean, he said like, I was an idiot. I was just trying to be edgy.

Speaker 18:         01:29:22       I'm not this person anymore. 10 years. Think back 10 years ago, how much like of a person you can change. I mean, the weird thing is like Disney hired this guy who has a reputation and now all the sudden they're shocked what James Gunn, this whole thing of firing someone for a tweet they may 10 years ago. So obscene. And I, and I think Disney now, it's probably like, maybe we were, I don't know if they're regretting it, but I don't think, I don't think a trillion signatures will ever make Disney eat attack. They'll never change their mind. No. And that's, I doubt it too. Um, even if they got triple those, what else? Do you have any other tweets? I actually enjoy, there's a bunch of your, what he says. So, um, oh, there's a maid's typical comments about nine 11. It's a holocaust. Um, just grabbed a monkey masturbating on a young child and it was called Terry that made him extremely happy. Uh, it looks like those were the only ones that they tweeted. And then we'll just given kind of some more examples of the type of thing. But again, that's, that's what's great. Disney will not rehire him because you know, this is Disney and they haven't been clean, but why did they hire him in the first place then everybody like, did they not know who he was? Companies are such fucking policies these days. Like, like the minute they sniff controversy. Yeah. It's like everybody shut the fucking door. You know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          01:30:51       You know what I'm saying? Listen, this goes out to every company out there to stick it about firing someone because they did something offensive. I mean, come on.

Speaker 18:         01:31:09       Technically the same company, she got fired by ABC, which is Disney. Disney owns everything. Disney. Disney owns like the butt plug that you see and they have a butt plug brand. Do they? Yeah. They own everything. I don't know why you said Bob Plug, but like they own Disney owns everything. Didn't they just buy out a huge company? Well, they're buying Fox. They're trying to and it looks like it's happening. There was a little bit of a back and forth. They were in a bidding war, but there they're going to win his, they're plucking Disney. Disney. When they own every company in America, that's when, that's when fascism will be here. Cause you're not gonna be able to make any jokes at all. And then you, you, you work in a factory. All of a sudden they own like fulfillment factories and you can't joke about the holocaust anymore suddenly.

Speaker 18:         01:31:55       Oh, 6 million, shut it down. You know what I'm saying? Yeah, I do. For the record, think those numbers are accurate or you're not a holocaust. But I will say that nine 11 is highly suspicious. And let me tell you, there's nothing I love more than monkeys. Jerk. That one's a weird one that he would tweet out. I like monkeys jerking on kids. That's how fucking weird image dog that I don't mind. Let's move on. All right. It's the next, uh, next step. This is a article from enemy. I thought this was interesting. Their enemy. Uh, it's a British, um, entertainment magazine. Uh, there are seven Robin Hood movies being made. Robin Hood Movie. Well, no, that already got made. That's the, uh, yeah. Ridley Scott, I believe. Oh, is that a good movie? No. Okay. That's probably why you haven't heard of it. It's not good at all. That's a shame.

Speaker 18:         01:32:55       So that's an older one. Um, but yeah, they are a in this era of reboots and relaunches and restarts and all the reasons you said seven, seven, did they not get the memo that like everyone else was making it? Robin had movie. Yeah, that's a good question. I mean they all have kind of their own take on it to be fair. Um, but does anybody even give a shit about Robin Hood? Like I like Robin Hood. Excuse me, Dan. Okay. I like Robin Hood. You're the target audience. Well guess what? You're going to be thrilled to hear. You want to be busy this fall. So just to quickly just rattled them off. We've got a movie called uh, Robin Hood origins, uh, or it was called Robin Hood origins. It's since been robin. Dan, I'm going to stop you. I don't need seven. Robin had titles. Okay. All right. Fair enough.

Speaker 18:         01:33:40       Look them up yourself, everybody, if you're, if you're curious. I sense I sense this. Yeah, that's a lot of Robin Hood. It's a lot of Robin Hood. To be fair. There's a lot of rabbinic. All right, next story. Um, this is actually like two weeks ago. This is too good. I mean, we had to, uh, had to do it to them, had to do it to him. There was a flight in China that loss pressure and dropped 20,000 feet. Um, because the pilots were vaping in the cockpit. How does that happen? What's the correlation? So they were vaping and it got so full or hotboxing the, they were hot boxing the cockpit. Wow. Yes. And, and it got, and basically they didn't want the vapor to escape into the passenger cabin, give away the fact that they were doing this. So, uh, the copilot tried to flip a switch that would keep the air from cycling into the rest of the cabin, uh, and hit the wrong button, which depressurized the cabinet.

Speaker 18:         01:34:37       Why is there a button to depressurize the cabin? Midflight anyway, that seems like a little danger. That's a good question. I mean maybe there's some preventative thing that they need to do that occasionally for, but um, but yeah, I guess it was right next to the other switch and it was so, so much fucking Dank vape smoke in there that they, uh, hit the wrong button and just had to kind of barrel down all the oxygen mask drops and uh, yeah, so maybe nation, the air over in China, are they executed when they land in China? I mean, uh, it is China. So let's just say that. Um, nobody's heard from these vape natures. I hope wherever you are, you're vaping in heaven now, but everyone's okay. God blessed Hallelujah injuries. Uh, our last, uh, this is actually the last story here. Um, a Colombian, a drug dog has been moved into witness protection for lack of a better term, after a gang in Columbia put a hit on this dog.

Speaker 18:         01:35:39       The dog named Sombra, uh, which means shadow in English, which snipped out a record amount of drugs in her career, um, has been forced to be moved to ensure her safety is, she's this dog has smoked, smoked out, sniffed out 5.3 tons of cocaine to that though was fucking awesome. Yup. There, although it says here the hit is only 70,000. They're going to I think, feel like, yeah. Which is a, by the way, 200 million a Colombian pesos. Yeah, but you were just calling it costs like a million pesos for like a loaf of bread. Well, yeah. And just to put it into some perspective, in 2012, there was a whole incident where the gang had put down a hits on police officer's offering $500. Whoa. So, so by comparison, this dog is the dog. The dog, Columbia are murdering people for five police for $500.

Speaker 18:         01:36:31       Well, uh, the article about it says that they found leaflets signed by the gang offering $500. I don't know if anybody actually took them up. Broke ass gang. 500 broke because of this dog fucking busting all their coke, so that's sad is how that's, come on guys. It's a fucking dog. He can kill people. You can kill helpless civilians, but spare the dog. The dog's out of it people. Come on. All right, so there is this, this is sombra little hero right here. I hope I pray for him. So that's it. That's it. That's the news. That's the hard right there guys. That's everything that's out there. Yup. Oh No. There's a couple of things I want to do first before we go out. First of all, why the fuck did I want to bring Ian Out? I don't remember. Oh, oh God. I wanted to make and smell the belly button lint.

Speaker 18:         01:37:26       I feel like I missed the train though, but it is Dan's birthday recently and we want it to honor Dan for his birthday. Damn. Would you come join us here for a minute? All right, hold on. I wish I could bring in out too, but we don't have enough people here and I'm going to make, I want to make you sniff this.

What did you get? Mazal Tov and lots of love and a gift card. The hot topic. Everybody. How much for all these shit? 15 bucks. The bare minimum. That's any amount between 15 and 500. I want you to spend that and I want to know what you buy. There are still hot topics. Yeah, they're out there actually that we did it. We listen, we are very generous. Heard the HD podcasts. We did get you this. Oh, it is a constellation. But the real gift is the hot topic. I appreciate that. Now this is kind of garbage honestly. Yeah. Throw that out all about the hot topic. But um, I do want you to go to hot topic and report back on what you were able to buy for 15 or 15 bucks. No, it's going to happen. You're going to end up going there and spending because you can't buy anything for 15 bucks. Kind of cursing.
