Now if you want to donate the link is into the description, but it's tilt to [inaudible] dot com slash they have an h three h three productions where I found strange. I've never seen an ad in a url, but there you have it work. It works. Yeah, I mean I've, yes, it works. It's in the description. We have got so many prizes. The prizes are. Um, let me go over these surprises to let you guys know what's on the line now. First of all, $1 is one raffle ticket. Now do not be confused that

Speaker 3:          00:01:31       he can, I'm having flashbacks the last year. Right now do not be confused. One, you do not have to donate multiple times more. You donate the more they can't. They don't have the technology though. Unsettling. It's really creepy. It's a little skin to animate doll face.

Speaker 2:          00:01:52       All right. Sorry. Go ahead. I go ahead on a $1 equals one ticket, $10 equals 10 rebels or you do not need to donate multiple times. [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          00:02:04       the more the more likely it is that you're going to, but even somebody who only donates a single dollar can technically when the pride, correct. Yeah, but so you could be, you're not to, you're going to have to, you know, the odds are stacked against you. If you only didn't have to kick down like a lot more than you might. It's pot. You could, you could. It's a, if it's a possibility, Justin's playing those mind games. But I, but I, you know, if you really want to win, you've got to throw down to beef up your, I'm hoping one of our prizes goes to somebody who donated a single dollar people who won donated large amounts. But there was one person that won a big boy prize and I don't remember what it was, but here we have, was it the lint was skippy's was the lucky one that was, you know, I thought when I thought about flying skippy out so we could smell his real belly button, like the source of the lint to kind of continue the story. But you guys vetoed that one. I mean, I know I was like, whatever you guys want to do. But

Speaker 4:          00:03:01       no, he didn't just like texts like, hey guys want to sniff his belly button and we just like me and justin just did. There was somebody else will get this one. Somebody told her flat out.

Speaker 3:          00:03:11       But I'll tell you what, not to be outdone. Last year we had one of the most powerful moments I think in live broadcasting history when Justin pepper sprayed joey salads and the face. Yeah, that was a beautiful, wonderful thing.

Speaker 4:          00:03:24       Charity. But did you feel spraying and other man of the fact that felt bad? I worry, you know, as the years go on and we can tackle it like alluded tick. Well you know, I mean I felt bad but also I couldn't help you know, laugh at the scenario but, but the uh, you know, I feel like as the years go on and we continue to do this and hopefully the numbers that we raised grow, uh, I hope we don't end up killing joke. You know, cause I was coming up with all these things like, oh man, what if he, you know, we, we get them like one of those really dangerous like, like one wheel. Well I guess it was, those things are dangerous but some sort of dangerous contraption to ride on a, that's going to be really hard to do to produce and be like, what if he falls and breaks his neck? And then it's like, oh I now he's paraplegic. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I think paraplegic,

Speaker 3:          00:04:17       if he dies this year, what are we going to do next year? We got up, we got to keep, if he dies

Speaker 4:          00:04:24       charity foremost. Yeah. Yeah. We need to make sure that um, we have some

Speaker 3:          00:04:28       tissue samples, sort of DNA that we can clone him because that technology is probably not too far down the line. There's a good, and then he's going to be puking today's who will be collecting if we told them guys, we have four milestones that we would like to hit during this live stream. Twenty five thousand fifty thousand seventy five thousand a hundred thousand every 25,000 Joey's going to be eating progressively spicier peppers. Go ahead and cut to joey so everyone can see what is going on in the backstage there. We've got a kitty pool set up. Joey is sant milk. Yes. With milk whole, what are we looking at? Where are we right now? I think it's the whole, it's whole baby all the way. And you know why not? A couple of little little packets of a half and half. Oh, we can see. Yeah. Yeah. We got the doc. We're filling up the pool with the milk. Now. Joey is going to be eating a Jalapeno at 25 and how be narrow at 50 a ghost pepper at 75 and a Carolina reaper, right? 75,000 does the Carolina reaper. That sounds terrifying. It's the spiciest pepper in the world is it really surpassed but it whatever. At a certain level. It's like the crazy ones. By what though? I wonder if they keep them up her. Oh, pepper acts of course. Eight tens of Grendel, I believe it's called A. Is that what they tend to at all saints? Satan. Sharp

Speaker 5:          00:05:58       crickets. Yeah. Hit me up. That's great. Yeah, for that. Yeah,

Speaker 3:          00:06:02       so we're very excited. We're very thrilled to be hitting these milestones. Let me tell you what you can win because we have some incredible prizes throughout. Now, first of all, if you donate $100, these are all on the prizes section of our donate page. A hundred bucks. You get to write something on Joey's body. Anything you want that's not racist or that will get us banned from this live stream for uh, for a, uh, how much is it to read on my neck? Was it a thousand or 500 because we did this last year and we opened the page here. Yes. Sworn it was 500 bucks to ride. Her neck is 500 that's right. So you guys can write on me. Yes. Let me show you this. I might donate 500 this legendary shot was produced last year and this is sharp sharpie. So you have to walk around like that for 500 bucks. Anything anybody wants could be written on your face. Do they get to choose the part of your foot? Whatever they like. What about, what about, what about inkbox? Like I have some inkbox free hand. Like you know, it, it you, you let it dry but it wouldn't show up until tomorrow and it lasted 18 days after the flood.

Speaker 3:          00:07:18       I was, I would like for a certain amount, you know, maybe it's worth it, you know, it's just, and I do have a life that doesn't sound though. He might be up for it, you know, a little almost up to $5,000 guys. So we are approaching our first, yeah, there's a bunch of cool stuff on the site and there's a bunch of rare, well, let me, let me go ahead. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So you can draw on us now. This one is super, super amazing. Um, oh yeah. You can buy, you guys gonna be doing, uh, original art throughout. Yes. We bribed that. We will. We will. But it's like, I don't know how good it's going to be. I figured we let something else right now, but we'll be dropping somebody some sketchy ruse. Yeah. I figure we'll let we have frames, you know, for, for what size paper is this?

Speaker 3:          00:08:02       11 by 14, I guess. Maybe not. So we'll be creating these three amazing artists. We'll be creating art and as they finish them, we will throw them up for your bidding pleasure. Or we could ask them like, hey, like, which ones should we throw up? Because some people would be like, yeah, sure. I think we'll sell them all just okay. Up Next Post Malone. Was that, uh, rolling loud? Is that, am I saying that correctly? Yes you are. Thank you Dan. Now Post Malone as you know, has been smashing the quiet. What do you mean? Sorry? It has been smashing a what? I'm sorry what Justin? I just said who rolls quiet, you know?

Speaker 5:          00:08:39       Oh wait, what did you go for it? Uh, what's that? Double Cricket. Yeah, we dealt with that.

Speaker 3:          00:08:51       So, so post Malone, this was smashed just last weekend

Speaker 2:          00:08:55       during his show at rolling, loud, signed and, and dedicated. This is, I truly believe a valuable part of music history that we will frame professionally and sent to the winter. So this is really, I think, an amazing donation by post malone who we think very much next up. This is something amazing. Justin, why don't you go ahead and explain? This is a rick and morty episode number one side by just rolling.

Speaker 6:          00:09:21       Right? It's a comma. It's the, it's the first issue comic, uh, the cover I did and then I had seen, I grabbed harmon to sign it and I signed it. So you valued this at, I don't know. It's weird. It's like on Ebay they go for all different ranges of amounts. I've, I'm not kidding. I've seen themselves for like $5,000 and that's what that might be the most I've seen itself without the signature of the creators, like 2000 1500. But, but, but honestly I think that's the low, it's weird. I haven't looked in a while so I don't know valuable. It's pretty valuable on the Ada. But with the two sick, with both of both of our signatures, definitely pretty rare. I've, I feel like that should, that should be, that's a good one to two to raffle. Oh, that's there. That isn't a premium premium price.

Speaker 2:          00:10:07       Go ahead and tell us about this because this also your fans have been going, uh, yeah, Nana's for this.

Speaker 6:          00:10:13       So, uh, like for, for any gravity falls fans or people who have gravity falls fans in their family, I'm watching, like we released the gravity falls journal number three. We've created this limited special edition where it has black light messages and like it's interactive and it's like this incredible book. And there was so difficult to make it so expensive that Disney was just like, we're making 10,000 of these and we are never going to do this nonsense again. Like we can't even believe that anybody would buy these because they're expensive and rare and hard to get ahold. And they only made a few. And then once they were done, like for the past year and a half, my entire twitter feed every day, it's just people like where can I get another gravity falls during number three special edition cause there and I was like, they're gone. There's not another single one left on the planet earth.

Speaker 6:          00:10:56       There's only one left that I have and it's mine and I'm not selling it. And then I was going through my stuff and I found one final journal number three special edition. These have gone on Ebay. I've seen them go for 4,005 Jesus Christ. Really? Yes. And this one is rarer than those because May, the reason this exists is because this was a test. This was the very first test printing of this book, just to see if it would all work. So I think there might be like a few like typos in there. Like it's like it's a first, first edition. Wow. It's unlabeled. So it's like when you get a normal one, it's like one out of 10,008 out of 10,000. This isn't even labeled. It's off the grid. It's the rarest journal number that is a real collectible. That is a real heroes right here folks. So, uh, so yeah, just like everything else, you know, one, $1, one raffle ticket for $1, you could win this. It's totally possible. Um, but I'd, I'd hedge my bets, maybe throw some more data. The throw in like

Speaker 7:          00:11:53       half the value of what it is, what it would sell on Ebay for. What do you think that would sell on Ebay for considering it's one of a kind. I couldn't say. I mean it's been like a year since any of these were available. So, but not to mention that's literally a production that's like the first one off the presses. Yeah. Oh, it's like when they make a stamp and there's like a misprint, maybe only one of those. Those are incredibly collectable, like the, the, that stuff is accurate and I value it at right. That's like a prototype toy or something. I won't lie. I don't know. I don't know if like signing it would make it less valuable if I should just include a signature with it or something. Cause I don't want to mess. Why don't we, why don't we ask the winter?

Speaker 7:          00:12:29       Yeah. We know what to choose. Signed or not. [inaudible] is not a bad thing. I can't imagine the winter being like don't, don't put it down and touch it. And this is true. When I found out he was, Alex was bringing that I, I was like, you tried to trade up. I was like, listen, I have, I have seals of book three. I'll treat you to auction off for that fucking one that wasn't even hitting. I know, you know, it's an embarrassing sad. You're a pro. You're not too proud to, I'm a, I'm a fan and I am a collector so we are at 6,200 guys. Let's keep going. Come on, get it together. We got joe sell ended up outside fucking proper and then retaining chuck. You know what I mean? We got to get the money gone stuff. Yeah. And then Ross Butler for all you the heart throbs Justin heartthrobs for all you girls that want to get Ooh, Ooh, yeah, yeah. This sweet treat.

Speaker 7:          00:13:29       He, he's uh, he's gonna eat like a up for auction is a private message is going to kick off for an MRI. Oh No, you don't get to see as being a no, no, of course not. No, no. God cause I was going to say it's all, it's all a pg 13, 13. I actually don't even know what a little nip maybe cares. It's like a, you know, it's like a private message, you know, a or whatever you want, like a video that, that Ross we'll send Ya. And that's fair. The tweet and God blessed. Yeah. And, and, and Ross is great and, and I, I felt like that. Oh, awesome. Yeah, this will come in handy. Um, but yeah, uh, I figured, you know, he's, he's got a massive fan base and I think that could help us. Raise a good chunk of absolutely and thank you to both of you for coming together on that.

Speaker 7:          00:14:19       We also have a switch bundle with smash and that'll be signed by everyone here. No, I'm kidding. I don't know [inaudible] we've got the xbox with fallout 76 damn brought this back. I was like, really? You had to get the 76 bundle? That being said, it is the x box one x. This is the premium top of the line. New Console that won't lad like the Shitty one that I have, but they sold me two or three years ago and of course we've got the PS four bundle. That's that new bomb ass ps four pro red dead redemption

Speaker 3:          00:14:52       get. These are amazing, amazing, amazing, really good raffle. And then we realized there's so much more, I can't even list it all, but this amongst so many others is oh rick and morty original script. We have four of those. That's really amazing. And I was going to tell you if we wanted to kind of bundle some of the rick and Morty, it's too late, but I was going to say that it may or may not be too late because if we wanted to bundle it, you can just carry over the, the, the, the, anyone who bid on a certain item that bid could carry over for whatever bundle that item goes to. Does that make sense? I don't know how complicated that would be, but I just thought of that last night in his mind. But I mean, it's probably more work than it's, we have an Alex Hirsch message donation.

Speaker 3:          00:15:37       You, are you showing your Dick or are you just saying stuff? It's going to be a, an audio adventure. I'll be live ventures. Uh, yeah. Uh, for any gravity falls fans, uh, you know, I can do any voice of any of the characters that I do. I'm just like, send me, what message do you want me to say? And uh, as long as it's not like ridiculously places, I will say it. Um, and uh, yeah, same is everything. Raffle tickets for that. Oh these are very frank are completely sold out. Rep and dip X. Justin's going to steal every fucking fine. There's a ton of limited edition is who it is. This call I will not be restocked. I see some people are waiting for that. It was a one time thing. So these are the last ones. Yeah, that's it. And then we have some, I know teddy fresh one off samples of things we've tried and then decided not to go out.

Speaker 3:          00:16:31       Like for example, let me show something like, um, you have the sweater. We made these, this happy like that sweater. And so we, we tested one an orange. That's one of a kind that only exists there. We have one in blue. These are ones that we sampled but never went ahead with. This one's in blue. That one actually. That's pretty good. Yeah, that's really, yeah. I don't know why he didn't go. I think maybe you might want to reconsider them. Reconsider. So it won't be that rare breed. There's like this was another sample. This is one of a kind. It doesn't exist anywhere, but that's official teddy fresh. This one was a really interesting story. We got this sample and then when I, when we tried it on and took it off, we really liked how the inside looked. You can kind of see that's how we ended up making the rainbow one, the new one. That is basically, it was based on the inside of this sweater. That's cool. That's awesome. We liked it better inside out. Well let's just do that. Um, and, and so, so much more. You guys have to go over to the prizes page and see there's a fricking buttload of amazing prizes to win there. So with that being said, in a couple more prizes, [inaudible] 9,009 big donation, Bam. We got to get Joey Salads

Speaker 2:          00:17:50       on that,

Speaker 7:          00:17:51       right? Yeah. Uh, nothing, uh, huge. Huge. Yeah. We got a couple of like hundred dollar ones, which is pretty awesome. We're not people, people are going to get shout outs for 500 plus donations. Yeah, absolutely. So thank you. Um, so

Speaker 2:          00:18:06       also guys, if you're watching this on the Vod, you can bid on all of these items for the next week. They are going to be up. So if you're not watching this slide, rest assured you can still win all of this stuff by donating on the campaign. Uh, and the description. So why are we doing this direct relief, direct relieve beneficiary of this uh, live charity event. They are one of the highest ranked charity organizations in the world on charity navigator. They are one of the only, are they the only or one of the only Dan uh, rank charities 100 out of 109

Speaker 7:          00:18:40       transparency. They are number one. They are ranked number one. So I imagine they are the only a a 100 out of 100. They have a perfect record on transparency and how much money actually goes to people that need it. Paying out executives, it's like, it can be so hard choosing charities because like all of them are doing some good, but you don't know how much of your dollar is going directly to the people who need it. How much of it is going into like printing fliers for the company and it's like this one, like every single rating system says like, yeah, your money's going to someone who needs it immediately, that dollar raffle ticket that might get you this prize also is like directly to some of the, it's also, it's also they're, they're going to be, it's, it's northern California and southern California right there. Like hitting everybody. Yeah. Yeah. Which is great.

Speaker 2:          00:19:28       Um, and so, and so we are doing this in honor of the, of the tragedy, the tragic loss of property and life that occurred here in California from the fires. Actually, I feel like a lot of people think about what happened here in California as just a bunch of rich people lost their houses, which is, you know, true as some and to some degree here in Los Angeles. But what happened in northern California, in the city of Paradise, this was not a rich community. The 14,000 homes were destroyed, the entire city was wiped out.

Speaker 7:          00:20:09       You can't really wrap your head around just how destructive that is. Let me show you a video that, I mean, I agree, but here I pulled up some media to kind of show you guys the scope of destruction. So like this is the city. I mean it's just gone. Oh Wow. That was a wall. That's, that's a Ariel. Ariel. God. I mean it's gone. One House. Just here's dean. Yes. That would want hilarious. Well not, I mean, I guess not funny. I guess more this one. Good. Who's like, as you're panning across, destroyed home footage. The phrase, wouldn't it be funny normally? No, you're right. You're right. No, it's fucking terrible. Horrific. Yeah. My, my, my, my partner at squatch games, her brother lost every like everything. Really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's like, no. It's like, I don't know. I keep asking, but do you have, it's like you do, like everything is going well.

Speaker 7:          00:21:04       It's not like, oh, I have insurance. Cool. Get back to normal tomorrow. It's like, no, you're, you're, you're, yeah. It's going to be about paperwork and also all the irreplaceable, I couldn't even imagine. Like I, I, we, we were talking about like what would you grab if you had, you know, I don't know how much time, like a couple of hours, what would you grab and load up? And it's like, no matter what you're going to get out and the next several days you're going to be thinking of all the shit you forgot you're going to, cause I have the worst, that moment over and over again. Oh my God, I forgot to get the fucking whatever, you know, I don't know, 15 minutes. What do you grab? Obviously the dogs, right? Yeah, I mean that's all I really care about books. Like all my cash flow, that's the first thing. I'm just like, I have years of original art and sketchbooks, like going back to high school.

Speaker 7:          00:21:53       So it's like, yeah, like, so I would grab all that if I could. I don't even know where it all is though. That's the thing. I'm not ready. I'm not ready to hire. Like, yeah, you're, it's like, give me a second. Maybe my laptop. I probably would just because it's like there's too much shit on you guys. Keep talking. I'm just going to show foot. This is somebody just driving through and then it might blow up. Sex dolls obviously replay. Irreplaceable. I'm not going to leave them. I don't know. I don't know that I would grab anything but the dog and maybe my laptop. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          00:22:29       Well my mom, I think my mom rubbed off on me in a awful way cause like she would like throw out my childhood art like that. It was like, oh my God, like an old receipt. That's horrible. Yeah. Why would she do that? Trust me, this is a long, long, long time coming and I'm in therapy. All right. We just had a really true that I'm in there don't know that she would throw the rock art that I was super proud of that I made in high school and I left there. I have, I'll tell you what I haven't painted since. It's almost as tragic as this in a winton I in a way that's kind of helped because like I don't throw away a single sketch book. I have a closet filled with like every drawing I've done since I have like drawings from highschool.

Speaker 7:          00:23:10       Sounds like just like, it's like I don't, it's like I don't need it. I can throw anything. No, I wish she didn't throw it away. I wouldn't eat them. Like tomorrow we gotta move Ileus, pack a suitcase and I was like, okay look. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well I feel like I'm good. That's good. That's good. I felt like healthier cause you know, take it with you when you die. You know what I'm saying? There's certain things who just said I have no, I'm not going to look out and I really don't care about like you can carry around everything you've ever touched in your life or heard about or done or, but like there's somethings that you are going to need and the majority of it

Speaker 8:          00:23:46       you're never going to think about. Even if you bring it, like how much shit is in your house there that you will never even think about. If it was gone, you wouldn't even notice. You know, I liked who were arguing for like, yeah, it doesn't matter if you lose all your stuff in front of this mountaintop. People losing their entire house. Oh, well, I mean, if you had a choice. Yeah. The difference between having everything just blinked out is horrific. Got a lot of media. Does anyone know how these started? These fires? How did the campfire start? Dan Fires, right? Well, the problem is that it's just so windy and dry. Yes. It's the combination. It's like you, if you breathe wrong, some brush, you start a wildfire or it's, it's a thing that's happening every single year now getting worse and worse. The campfire specifically we believe was started by our friends at PG and e company, mother fucker. But like I said, you could almost just like take a, a spicy shit and start a fire. That's true. But yeah, some of their equipment, uh, overloaded and caused the spark and that's what started it. I shouldn't eat. Why chewing into the mix. People talk shit about it. We'll talk good about me.

Speaker 8:          00:24:57       Actually. The problem is that he was, a lack of rain was, they're amazing. There's no rain. The Santa Ana's, which are these, we got rain like the week after like two weeks after the, it was like blood barely and not the why. Knowing the worst. It was like, come on, are you kidding me? Now you're going to rain. Well then they're like, oh, the mudslides, they're going to fuck everyone up. Will that, exactly. It's like a, it's, yeah, on the whole everything is super dry and then you get the Santa Ana's which are these really warm dry wins and it's just a fatal combination by the way. We don't know.

Last year in June, we right on Joey, Bernie Sanders Fan boy subscribe to Cutie Pie and unsubscribed from Jesus Christ. So where, where, where are we? I subscribe to see series. I just want to acknowledge was subscribed to a PD pie unsubscribed to two series, but since the other one was subscribed to Pewdie Pie, I figured, you know, we could, we could break that up a little bit. Thanks. We're done. It's a little redundant and the names, give them a shout out if you would. There's not much, what do you want to know? Whatever. Where could we do it? Just go ahead wherever you got space. Not a lot of room. Yeah, let's start with the neck was out there. Yeah, just like on, so just try to start, you know, riding on top of writing as we continue through the, just get in there.

Um, subscribe to Pud Pi's next and unsubscribed from t series is interesting. Joey's skin is, is, is not accepting the really Joey Joey, you have unusually soft hands. Do you know that? Every no law. Okay. Well does that make your hands soft? I masturbate a lot to the lotion. I got good lotion. Yeah. Seriously. Because every time I've shipped I'm shook your hand show you, I've noticed you have a remarkably soft skin. Whenever you talk about me on your podcast that you always bring up my socks because I thought it's just so bizarre. It's like I don't ever shake someone's hand and notice that they have remarkably soft skin, but you just, how many times a day do you jerk off for really with lotion? Cause that's like a whole thing. I use cocoa butter. I like, but it's all hours. I lotion my arms sometimes before, before. Yeah. That makes sense. It makes more sense. Yeah.

Speaker 8:          00:29:42       Pewdie Pie. All right. I like how Bernie Sanders, impunity pyre equally important in the imaginations of our donors. They're like, these are the two causes of our time. This is what matters. Tea Areas series. Now while you go ahead and so grateful, I don't know what any of that means. I have an interest. I have a human interest story. This one really touched me about from the fires. The dog waited outside. They had to evacuate. Oh No. And this dog, this dog ones mess me up, man. This dog is such a legend. Somehow survived on its own in the middle of this fire and waited outside the house for a week. This was something a dog apparently stood guard at a burn home four weeks until his own or returned CBS to Sandra Mitchell. That was the story. Look at this name of this guy now that he's finally, and then also, okay, good, good boy t series on me.

Speaker 8:          00:30:39       Paradise Fire. But she had to leave her no jokes about her name and his brother Miguel. Behind 85 people died in the fire. 14,000 homes were destroyed, including gay lords. Miguel, come on and then a few days later, face rescue workers spotted madison that is burned out home. The loyal, hey man, through the worst of circumstances being so emotional, the animal rescue worker left, so they just bought the dog and she went back to try and capture heads. Survived, founded. Just sitting here waiting. I mean, that's the heart Anatolian shepherd. It's a brain. Three weeks week, one week, one week. That's when they rolled up sweet creature.

Speaker 8:          00:31:37       God, Gaylord was allowed to return home for the first time in almost a month. How does she brought Miguel with her and they didn't know if the dog was okay or not treat. The dog came running in additional looking at warmed his heart. I need him. He's like, oh wait, hold on. That's a heartwarming story, but I just have parts. Let's, I want to pick it apart. Dissect that emotion. So it's like, how much time was she given to evacuate? I want back. Well, it paradise. The fire was so, a lot of people parish because it was so fast. I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't want to do whatever answer is most heartwarming.

Thank you. Got Cameron. Boaster beautiful cat and shout out to your girlfriend Chris. Guys, we're inching closer to this. We're at 19,000 joey. Good. Pucker up your asshole because we are about to get on a wild wild ride. Now let's watch a Christmas video that I saw on youtube today.

Speaker 3:          00:38:21       That is one of the greatest things I've ever seen. You guys know this thing's going absolutely viral. Five 15 million. It was supposed to only a couple of days ago. This is mark rope rubber. This is, you're going to love this. [inaudible] can tell them. You've seen this, Alex. I've seen it. I haven't seen this. So as you guys know, box theft is a huge problem today. People going up to your head and especially around the holiday, they go up to your door and they steal your package. So this guy was tired of this happening and what he devised was a bomb, a glitter bomb to go off with a camera in the box so he could record there. We had the wrong people get called. Now this is going to cut it. Now this guy, this guy is a, was as a former NASA engineer.

Speaker 7:          00:39:06       Yeah. Like being sent to Mars. It's half with the wrong guy.

Speaker 3:          00:39:11       Exactly. Yeah, yeah, exactly right. Having fun making glitter bomb packages. So great. He does this a bunch of times and he captures just unbelievable footage. So let's, all right,

Speaker 10:         00:39:23       I may be biased, but sometimes in your design,

Speaker 7:          00:39:27       and it doesn't just throw it up, literally four cameras capturing live and it also has, um, barb on, but as a fart bomb also the fart bomb is just incredible. First, the glitter shoots out. This has been really hard bump shoots at like every 30 seconds. So they have to get rid of it when they realized, because at first they're going to be like, Hey, what is this? And then it keeps going. So amazing. So the, and then the best thing about this is that I expose, this guy's got to mass produce these and sell them. Yeah, it was about to say I would buy it the most fine grained glitter in the world. Impossible to get out of carpet.

Speaker 10:         00:40:00       [inaudible] package has been moved off the property. So I put it out on the porch and now all that was left to do

Speaker 3:          00:40:05       what's his weight and he could have done a better wrapping job.

Speaker 10:         00:40:08       Okay. So I was at work and I got a notification that the geo fence we set up had been tripped. So then I checked the cameras and sure enough the package has gone. So I checked the GPS and sort of tracked it and it appears they're in a car because they seem to leave my house pretty quickly off. It seems to stop in a parking garage, which is where I'm headed to now. And if you're new here, this isn't a prank channels. So I am completely out of my comfort zone. Rubber by the way, this legend and there she is.

Speaker 11:         00:40:37       Oh, oh,

Speaker 10:         00:40:42       oh. So, so, so we're covering, it would still work even if I didn't get the box back, the footage would upload to the cloud, but it's just faster to plug the phones. I'm gonna go home and find out what he thought of everything, how I ended up here. So it appears he was walking down the sidewalk and then suddenly makes a hard left. They take these clothing, actually makes it to this parking garage where this glorious sequence unfold.

Speaker 11:         00:41:13       Um, like four cameras.

Speaker 7:          00:41:15       Oh,

Speaker 3:          00:41:19       okay.

Speaker 11:         00:41:31       Look

Speaker 7:          00:41:31       at that. They're looking at my car, dude.

Speaker 5:          00:41:34       Everything. Oh my God. I don't know what this is. Literally like everywhere. My friend CC is also had some packages stolen. So you make her a few days. He didn't. Oh Dude. That's what I'm saying. I would, I would buy, I would spend more than what a home pod costs or whatever want to do whatever, whatever it is, the actual item.

Speaker 5:          00:42:00       This is more of this needs to happen like this is too good. I saw another video of a guy who cashed it and Piss in a box and now the best part of the FARC coming. Wait for that. I like that he's upset. Like, come on. How could you play me like that? I don't deserve this at all. Life is fair, dude. You never going to get that stuff out of your car. Oh yeah, that'll, that'll be there for, that's the FARC spray and his car with the windows up genius down to the Fart spray. Oh, it's a beautiful thing. Oh, this is, I listed, they go piss like someone did something awful to them. I also like that they're narrating to no one. They're so pissed off that they have and be like, this is too good. This is too good. It is. People are assholes. They're like stealing shit and then the camera didn't work. He said, I lifted. It keeps going every 30 seconds. It just doing it. You probably spend a lot of money, but he grabbed that. At least these are having a good time. They're like cracking up of the Jelly, a draw. Lee Burglars Him saying, you shouldn't have even taken that. It's like, yeah, that's the moral of this episode of legends of the crypt keeper or whatever like that.

Speaker 5:          00:44:07       Man, these people are so brazen. I love about inside. He's just like stunned trying to figure out what to do with this

Speaker 10:         00:44:34       on Myers. Did her launch mechanism. Just don't take other people's stuff. Not only is it not cool, but on the plus side you'll never find yourself in this situation or perhaps even worse. This one will get in here. Then

Speaker 7:          00:44:52       who you had in there, you have it. One of the best videos ever made just in time for the holidays. Why? Once again, Mark Rober, God bless his soul guys, we are up to $20,000 Oh, when's the first pepper chowning five hours were 5,000 away from this Chi eating on. What kind of a power on the first one is a raw jalapenos and is it? Is he eating the whole thing? Whole thing. Can I just take a bite? It's a Jalapeno Joe. Give it, cause I don't want to drop dead because if you think about it, well what if my don't get people never do like eight the entire pepper. What I'm saying is like people eat the ghost pepper and that's that. They go, you don't have, you don't have to eat the reaper and then that shit, but I got, oh, okay. You don't have to eat the whole of those do does he?

Speaker 7:          00:45:45       Maybe you're the challenge. All the spices are going to be trying to weasel his way out. Well, we're talking about the Jalapeno. You, you owe us here 25 or let's say when we do Jalapeno, that's not, that's the entry level. I mean, I'm just listening about ahead of time. Let's set the rose. Okay. And era. Our whole a whole, he's got hold of the whole gang, a whole hub in Europe. I then you can go half on the two. Oh No, no, no. It's got to eat the whole thing. Justin says you got to go. This is why the money's coming in. Just those saying he felt bad about swearing you last year and now he's like, [inaudible] I have to abide by what? The audience, your expiry. I'll do it. I'll do whatever. Donating this money. Also, the donations are slowing down. I mean we're at thousand 300. They nail it because they heard these knocking. It's like, what a, wait a minute. This is affecting the stock. The warning label says, um, handle with gloves. You can't even touch the thing. It goes in your mouth, not on your hand.

Speaker 10:         00:46:54       All right. Hey, I've got a couple more messages that we got to right. Oh, excellent. Excellent. Excellent. What are the hot, so I've got, uh, two more for Joey. A sub to Ryan McCarty. Um, Yup. So why don't you join us on pouty? Joey can do the writing. Yeah, sure. Keep going. So it's up to Ryan McCarty. I'll put it, I'll put it in discord so you see how it's spelled and buy Bitcoin, both of those on Joey. And then I have some for Ethan to, uh, we have, uh, we just want a james wine Hoff

Speaker 6:          00:47:30       wants you to write Jacob's sausage on a, on somewhere. And then Simon is asking you to write hightail, which, uh, is the name of his video game and he's going to use a screen cap from the screen in his trailer. Okay. The, okay. All right. Go ahead. That's a, that's a good capitalism. Exactly. Advertising honestly, I mean 500 bucks for, yeah. What we could do, by the way, is once we could do a thing where once real estate has completely taken, we clear some room cause it's like, you know, the, the, the uh, the footage of you, the phase. That's true. You know, I don't want to, I don't want to play a realistic, the point where there's literally no, well, so far I think it'll be a while. And so far these guys, I mean, we're at 21,000. I mean, am I right? We're getting close. Oh, what are you writing on my face?

Speaker 6:          00:48:24       I just dropped it in discord for me. Oh Wow. Here you go. Oh, it's in discord. So what, why are you doing that, Alex? You've got a big part of the Netflix, Netflix family now. Oh yes, that's right. Yeah. Um, uh, the streaming algorithm program company. Netflix giant. I worked for them now. So tell me, what does that mean that because you, they, they like bought your whole, they bought my life, right? They tattooed the end lower back, the equivalent of what Justin's doing to me now. They did essentially. Yeah. Also, I was working on this, uh, I was working on the secret movie that I guess I'm not allowed to talk about, you know, I can't even say, I can't even say what it is. It's, it was big. It was, it was a thing. Um, but uh, it wasn't creatively. And a Netflix made me a really amazing offer to basically make anything in the world I want, which is kind of an intimidating thing if just like, you know, like a company just like plops down a bag of money on your chest and it's just like whatever you want to make, make it.

Speaker 6:          00:49:26       Um, almost you're saying it's almost too much freedom. It's awesome. But it is like, it is one of those things where you're like, wait, so like what are the rules here? And other sensors, you know, like I came from the Disney channel or was like, everything was censored, you know, and it's like, it's like, no, like whatever you want, man. I'm make a movie. You want to make a show? What do you, what do you, so I'm working on a new top secret, untitled Alex Hirsch project. Cool. Um, that I'm very nice. Did a cartoon is a live action. Can you say anything? Uh, I, I, they probably would be fine with it, but I want to keep it a secret. You want to keep it a secret? Secretive? Yeah, just always been secretive. You've back of the Disney days, man. I remember on fish hooks you were like hiding in your office and I'd knock on the door and you'd open it a crack and he got it.

Speaker 6:          00:50:06       And I'd be like, Hey, can I come in? I want to talk. And then you'd be like, hold on, close the door, turn every single screen. Worked forward around every, like all this shit. I'm like, all right. Uh, that's like God damn it. Probably because like I was fan of justice before I met him, so I was like intimidated and I was like, oh, this guy's going to see my stupid cartoon idea. Like that's when I was coming up with gravity falls at the time I was like, I don't want him to see my stupid drawings, but I have a hard time throwing when people are like looking over my shoulder, you know what I mean? At the same time, like I have a hard time writing when there's like lots of people around, like I can't write and like a coffee shop for some reason.

Speaker 6:          00:50:40       Like I need to like lock the door, dim the lights, and then, then the demons enter, you know what I mean? But I'm working on something really cool for Netflix right now, but I can't say it to this. How much this body and what's the timeline? How much time do you, or is it just totally, do they put a timeline on yours? It just like whenever, whatever. Yeah. Yeah. Um, it's, uh, around, around a year from now, there's going to be a lot to talk about. Um, like, uh, I'm also producing some things. Uh, there's, Netflix is like making a big bid for animation. They just like notice like, okay, Disney bought Fox and so now they have like simpsons and family guy and Netflix is like, okay, all right, let's go all in, let's, let's make a bunch of Rad shows. We need the next generation of animation.

Speaker 6:          00:51:24       Um, and it's like happening right now. It's very cool to be a part of it. Like, it feels weird because I'm used to just bitching about my parent company. Right? It's like I was always like whining about Disney and like, they were great to me, you know what I mean? But like, I was just so constantly aware of all the rules and things I can't do, you know, on the Netflix is just like, yeah, whatever crazy thing you could think of. You want to make a movie, you want to make a mini series, you want to mix up shot holes, bro. So get ready for the Butthole Bros starring me and Justin reuland. Obviously I'm pop a butthole. He's a jimmy bottled juice and we are two brothers who have big gaping buttholes right in our faces gimmick. And it's why the ladies love us coming to Netflix.

Speaker 6:          00:52:06       Uh, so for that I would watch that. Don't, don't give him, don't give him too many ideas. Don't give away the good one. And Justin, what secrets can you tell us about all the things happening in the Justin verse right now? Alex through that oval on over to Justin mass fine. Oh no, go ahead. I mean I'm like, Oh yeah, I can't do that. No, I get, I get that you are, I'm just, I'm fat. I'm fat. No, let's go over to judge. I mean like keep, keep like I can't talk about it. That's why I was just ignored it. I just wanted to hear more about how do you, cause you said you haven't like no rules, you can do anything. It was still hard to you. You have to come up with something, right? Sure. Yeah. Well, I like my, I don't know, everyone has like a different creative process I guess.

Speaker 6:          00:52:49       Like for me I kind of do like my own like mental hunger games where like I'm constantly coming up with like different variations. Like when I came up with gravity falls, I actually came up with three TV shows. Um, and I pitched like three shows to Disney. I'm like, one was about time traveling dolphins, the other two were terrible. Um, it literally was, I'm not making that up. That was going to be my other show if they had picked that up. But so like I just like, like fill a sketchbook with like lots and lots of characters and situations and stuff. And then I like kind of compete them against each other. In my mind I'm like, which one is delighting me more today? You know what I mean? And then like make a little like power bracket of my own ideas for myself and then like show like maybe a few people like, what do you think, what do you think?

Speaker 6:          00:53:27       And then I'm like, all right, all right, this is the thing I want to spend a bunch of years on. So is that what kind of what you've been doing? Yeah, that's what I've been doing and I've like finally narrowed it down to some really exciting stuff. Wow. I'm like stoked on and come up with your arm timeline. Like deadlines or do you have deadlines? It's, I mean it's all, it's kind of like, it's like sort of the wild west over there right now because it's brand new, you know what I mean? But they're like very supportive. Like they have, they have deadlines and they have like their producers structure. But within that, like the very, all the cart, like you can be like, hey this is a different kind of thing. I want to try something else and maybe we put more time here and they're so open to it.

Speaker 6:          00:54:04       Like it's also like there's no commercials so you can make episodes like longer. Super interesting. Do you don't have to think like I was so used to like, oh, if it's two seconds over, Disney is like, you've got to find those two seconds. And here it's like, whoa. You're like, you don't have to worry about act breaks. Yeah. It's a, it's a different world man. Um, but it's really, and the executives they are, do they give you notes? Cause probably Disney's all up your ass with notes. Yeah. Um, the executives basically are just like a first audience so far. Um, like they're really cool. They just want to see something that's funny. And like, I think the traditional development model and television is network spend a crap load of money developing like one or two projects that they like put all their hopes in and they promote the shit out of him and then if they're not immediately hits the, cancel them.

Speaker 6:          00:54:47       Right. Um, and it's like, that's not good for anybody. That's like putting way too much pressure on every single project where it's like the new kind of streaming pipeline. Like the way Netflix does it is like we're just going to empower a bunch of creators who we think have something cool and we're going to make smaller seasons and put them all out there. And if people watch it, you get more episodes. And if people don't, we're not picking up for a second season, but those episodes aren't going anywhere, you know, like, so it's like, it's almost like, like, like low risk, high reward, you know what I mean? Um, and it like content. Yes. And they want it on demand. Lots of content and lots of ideas. I'm just kidding. It's a little scary. There's like so much shit. There's so much shit on streaming.

Speaker 6:          00:55:25       It's weird to be making tv in an era where there's never been more television in history and you're like, how are people going to notice? But I feel like good stuff is still recognized. You know what I mean? Like definitely there's so much junk out there with it when like something really hits or something, it's not at all. Like, I remember that there was that show, high profits, that show was so fucking good. Well, I've never even heard of it. No one's heard about it. The critters profit. It's a, it's a reality show or it's like more of a documentary. It's done like documentary series. So it's not like cheap, it's not like a cheap reality show. It's like a well produced documentary series about this couple that opened up. Um, you know, we'd store on the main strip and Colorado in this town in Colorado.

Speaker 6:          00:56:08       This is like ski town and it's just fascinating man. It's like, so all the picking it up, I'm greenlighting it. It's on Netflix. Oh wait. But it was bringing it back, but it was originally on like, like CNN, CNBC or msnbc or one of these other channels. Sort of these deep cut channels. And in their first wave of, hey, we're going to make original stuff, but nobody only, no, everyone only knows us for our news content. You know what I mean? So, so it just, it just slipped through the cracks. But I watched it on Netflix and I was like, I would kill for a second season. I wanna I wanna I wanna I want to see where these characters and maybe the justice people are going to get it picked up. Maybe you talking about tweeted about it a long time ago and nobody cares exclusively for like my own, like if you find a toy that is slightly broken Uri and I need to, I, well the problem is I got, I started getting scared of twitter.

Speaker 6:          00:56:57       It was like, I don't want to tweet any like original thoughts because God only knows where that could lead. So it's just like 20 year old like personal yelp for like everything you buy by default. That's kind of what's happened unfortunately. But yeah, yeah. God forbid thoughts. Yeah. It's like going to look man, we gotta be careful on twitter. You know, it's like, but the other cool thing about Netflix, cause you were just talking about like that's such a common thing is if somebody makes a great show for the wrong channel and it shot, that happens all the time. I mean that happened.

Speaker 3:          00:57:24       Got Two more, uh, oo much here. By the way. We are up to 23,000. We have, we got more shit to write asking.

You know, we all say something in our lives it's remembered is like our most powerful quote and that might be yours. That might be just chiseled in stone. Well guys, 50,000 is next. Can you bring in the ghost pepper and the Carolina very with those things look like.

Speaker 3:          01:06:00       That's my dog, Dan. I'm almost done picturing the pepper. Really Getting Ready to tread. It was going to jump into the milk bone. This doesn't, I feel it. This is not even that much and I'm already feeling it like in my stomach because I'm never eating this much ever before. It's usually like a little sliver. You know. You feeling it more in your stomach then your mouth. Yeah, more than the stomach. Oh Man. Your job when it starts, I'm in trouble signing up. I'm in trouble, man. You're going to be eating the entire pepper for all of these. Yeah. See not that big yellow ones. Well, well bring in the Carolina reaper in the wait, wait, wait. Oh, just just to show you in a reaper. Terrifying name. Just, Oh, we're at 26,000 guys, keep going. Keep in mind. Or if somebody donates $1,000, I will lick the Carolina reaper.

Speaker 3:          01:06:48       I know that doesn't sound nuts. You had to like lick the inside dead. Tell me about your experience earlier date. Thank you so much. Yeah, I was just curious. So I tore off a tiny little piece of one of these Carolina reapers, which by the way, they are dried because they are not in seasonal current Lord. And yeah, I found out when I looked it up, the dried ones are actually even spicier. Oh boy. So yeah, I just, I just licked the tiniest little corner of it and it was about 30 minutes of pain go out of my mouth. Yeah. So, well, let me see. Oh Wow. Where'd you guys get these from? They'll order them online. Yeah. Okay guys, what things are moving along? We're at 26,000 and a half. Come on close. Want to donate some money? I have only a thousand dollars. I want to get, I want to, I want to sweeten this, mix it up.

Speaker 3:          01:07:35       I want to sweeten this a prideful. What if we do? What if we do a, um, one of these poles where either your licking this, either you're looking at the pepper or who you're at this table is brave enough. Justin, you're not even anything. We'll do it. No, I'll do her in it. You can't because she's pregnant or even the intern or in the intern. And so everybody who donates like how's it about, how does that work on the poll? Let's, let's start there and we can build our way. Okay. Like taking a little nibble. Yeah, but can we say, I don't know, cause I find out what you get in on this with us licking the pepper. It's just licking it. Can somebody, but I don't know. Or Sheeko can you take poor a little frederick out and he's at the door maybe. I think he needs to go outside possibly for a little diarrhea.

Speaker 3:          01:08:22       A little foreshadowing of what you always sell. Does it? Yeah. So let's make it, let's make it three ways. Three way, Paul. Every, every donation is you get to vote for it. Either you, Justin or me who takes a lick of a pepper at the end of a certain amount of time to do that. I'm, I'm in, I'm totally, and we set that up easy to get turned in or no. Oh, sure. Yeah. Let's make it four then just because of the little wildcard. Yeah. And do you copy that? And so as a pull between who you and the intern, you, Alex, Justin, Alex, who gets for Hulu and people can donate to vote for who has to look the pepper, let's say. Let's put it all together. Let's say after whatever. We have the call with the CEO of direct relief right now. And after that call, yeah.

Speaker 3:          01:09:07       Coming up and I'm a woman yelling in a couple minutes to answer that call. We'll go to the, to the poll and we'll have a pepper lick. And can someone send me in water? We need water for the site. I hate milk. I like almond milk. It's a good thing we're filling a pool with milk crate. More uncommon. Um, now, um, Dan, let me know when that poll is up so I can get all the good people donating. We're at 27,000 guys. 26 your way to do a like a, a chat only for the people who donate or only polls from you. Only polls just pulls. Now Justin, we were talking about rick and morty. Now you, uh, thank you Mitchell. God bless you. Appreciate you. Now you guys were Ho now tell me about the negotiations because you guys were, there was a bit of a, there was a lot of media, a lot of speculation about what was going on about that.

Speaker 3:          01:09:59       If they were going to renew the show or not paying the new season. Yeah, no, I mean it was, you know, it was a complicated, just a complicated, uh, I don't know how much I can get into the, yeah, well you're going to get justin in trouble. No, don't say anything. You don't want to you, I'm only talking about what's in the media, so I'm not, I mean ultimately it's like any show, like at a certain point that there, there has to be, are there that you just renegotiate and it took a little bit, but we did it some haggling repair that, that, that, that's old news cause like that, that that renegotiation was like we lock that stuff down like way earlier this year. Like we've been in production for a while, right? Yeah. Um, hey that poll is up. The poll is up. How do people vote? They just go to [inaudible] on our, on the donation page, uh, on the left hand side there's a little category for poles and you can just donate to whoever and uh, early lead to in the intern pulls. I see. So there's a cat. Yeah. Well it's just $1. Just $1 for who likes the pepper. So click the link in the description. It's tell defied.com/i don't know why there's an APP, a social strange url at free productions

Speaker 8:          01:11:14       on the left, there's a donation button. So I'm not sure. A pull button. Sorry. There's only one color. You are you kidding me? Come on guys. Well, Ian, it looks like $1. Oh, Justin, $5 Ian and the intern $21 so that we know when to cut it off. So maybe, you know, at the five o'clock hour, whoever's winning how long. Yeah. Yeah. Good call. Um, so keep those, keep that cash. Why the way I just want to show this off. I don't know if there's a way we can get a, Ooh, oh, I'm done. I'm done building this and whoever wants it, it's up for auction. All right, allison, what's her name? This value, but I don't know, cause I haven't seen this show, this anime show.

I'm putting it, I'm officially finished. I'm going to, I'm going to, we can write all over it or do whatever. Do you assemble a day? Oh, not that many. Uh, I'm done. I'm not, but I'm like, I'm done doing other anime girl models. No, no. I just weird other ones, but I'm like, I the, this was too much of my, what is the significance of this? I don't know. I just felt like building something.

If I'm saying your last name wrong, that's because Mitchell betrayed me. You betrayed my trust. Um, so joey, tell me what's the weirdest thing you've jerked off to you? I don't even know. I don't jerk off to weird things. What's your category? What do you like? Just like, I like skinny bitches. Why do you say bitches? Well, when I'm watching porn, it's like you, you like the demeaning factor. Do like you say skinny bitches. So that implies somehow that you like the demeaning and I just, I mean, any grill does porn. It was like, I feel like he couldn't call them bitches, you know, like, hmm.

That sounds so scary. Monster. That sounded so weird. I said I just, you know, I like pretty girls. God. Your tone embarrassing. No, but seriously, let's not talk about what I like. I like Fart porn. Bart. Yeah, me too. Do you have a favorite a star? He's the CEO of direct relief and listening are probably, luckily he is. Is he like reevaluating his choice to be associate with like, you knew what he's getting himself to. Justin rolland pepper sprayed joey cells in the face last year. I can't say. You don't know what you're getting yourself into, Joe. Uh, Justin is pooping. You know, you know what I'd like to do? Do you want to talk more about your porn preferences, Joey? No, let's not do that.

Speaker 3:          01:18:26       Justin's walking back in right now and I have Thomas on Stan. We're up to $29,000 guys, keep it going for this. This, you're eating that mall. No, this is small but deadly. And Joey here is looking a little too frank. He's looking a little too jolly. He's look a little too happy. We got to get the milk flowing. But in the meantime I do is we have the CEO of direct relief on the line with us. Thomas Tighe go ahead and uh, please welcome to the show of Thomas Standby. I'm going to pipe them in in just a moment. Here we go. All right. Taking them live right now. Here we go. Hey Thomas. Hello. Welcome. Thanks for calling in.

Speaker 12:         01:19:13       Thank you so much. Pleasure to be here. Thanks for what you're doing.

Speaker 3:          01:19:16       Oh well let me ask you, how do you, how do we say your last name? Is it tighe. Okay, thank God. Because I was going to fire an intern if they, if I had a mispronounced, so, so thank you so much. Um, now since we got you here, maybe you can tell us a little bit about, you know, how the money we raise affects you guys and specifically how it goes to help the people who lost their homes and everything and the wildfires.

Speaker 12:         01:19:47       Well, first of all, I really can't thank you enough for what you're doing. It's um, you know, these things. He had a lot of attention at the time and then there's so much news coming at people, it's easy to forget. So I think what direct relief does every day is try to work to make sure that their health services available for people who need them and can afford them. And on an everyday basis we work with the local nonprofit community health centers, um, free and charitable clinics all around the United States. And you know, we're based in California. So that's where we started. So that's typically where we plug in and in Butte county. And um, just like last year in Sonoma, Napa when the fires hit, these places that serve people who are vulnerable, even on a good day is where we plug in. Cause there's such, so deeply rooted in the communities.

Speaker 12:         01:20:33       And unfortunately I think, um, what happened in paradise was just kind of unprecedented. I think it, again, it caught us by surprise here in this kind of new abnormal mistake and kind of the devastation that just, you know, cause a lot of deaths caused a lot of people to flee. So what we did is kind of what we do and checked in from a health perspective, what can we do immediately? And ended up just rushing on daily deliveries, things from kind of the masks for the smoke and the inhalers for people who were, you know, had breathing problems, the oxygen concentrators, um, that, that seniors often need, but particularly if they're evacuated and putting a shelter, um, and just basic drugs and things like that up up. All the evacuees ended up in these temporary shelters and they all got hit with the norovirus, which is kind of this horrible disease of like vomiting and diarrhea.

Speaker 12:         01:21:27       So it was just about as bad as you can imagine. But you know, the people who we were working with who were kind of staff from the hospital that was burnt out, they set up a clinic in the East Avenue Church up in Chico and were just so on it, you know, just really, you know, just working 24 hours a day with nothing. So that was kind of where we started. And since then we've been continuing to work with the kind of the local public health officials who were kind of overwhelmed and even the firefighters and um, kind of the first response teams that, you know, they, so many people got deployed from around the state and we've worked with them a lot and saw last year, even here in Santa Barbara where we were burned out and then had a debris flow, you know, after five minutes of rain the hill came down.

Speaker 12:         01:22:11       Um, sometimes they need help for specialized gear or just terrain vehicles. They can go out and do the, unfortunately in paradise, it's the remain recovery and kind of identifying that. So we're working with all of them. And um, you know, we get money like what you're raising for a particular place. It's for that place. It's not for director leaf. It's, you know, we look at ourselves as trustees and make sure that the people know that it's there. The money's going. If they want us to buy something for him, if money is needed, we'll transfer the funds and we've already started committing funds to some of the local groups that are just doing such good work, nothing. And um, and we're in a position where we can cover all the expenses related to that out of, you know, our normal organizational expenses. So anyway, really appreciate it. Particularly now after it's kind of out of the headlines what you and your team are doing, um, for a whole different audience and the type who probably think about direct relief, her stuff like this all the time. It really means a lot, you know, can't thank you enough.

Speaker 6:          01:23:14       Thank you. I mean, it sounds like you guys are doing amazing. Yeah. And port and work so grateful that this exists. That we could set this up. Can I ask a question? I just wanted to, I just wanted to know, um, you know, there's been a, we were talking about how you guys have this like amazing rating, like you're number one in terms of its transparency and I just was curious like what goes into that kind of, what, what's, what's the reason for rating like that? Cause you guys are so trusted.

Speaker 12:         01:23:46       Yeah. It, a lot of it's just, you know, what you'd expect. I mean, how much money did you spend on fundraising to get the money that you received? And that's a big point of contention. People don't, generous, big surprise. They don't like sending a dollar in and having half of it's sent back on the mail that they're going to throw away. So we've never done that. I mean I think our model has been, you know, we work out of a warehouse and um, kind of functionally what we do is, you know, it's a distribution center so we can, uh, we have to have specialized licensing for the medications that we hold, but it's all provided free of charge. We encourage companies to, you know, make their products available at no charge, we will handle them as well. And with all the same accreditation that any pharmacy or chain drugstore would use.

Speaker 12:         01:24:29       We're, we have the same accreditation that, to handle these things. But that's kind of the dilemma we're in as a society, right? Cause if you have money, you're very well served and people target you, they know a lot about you, they know your preferences. And if you're not a consumer, you're kind of off the grid. So I think what we're trying to do in general, it's just bring that level of kind of efficiency in delivery of services to people. Not because there's any, we do it for free. So there's no profit incentive. But we know that it can be done well with these tools that exist technologically and that, so they can, that's everyday trying to bring, um, kind of the resources that exist and efficient way to the people who need them and can't afford them for health services. You know? And, um, it's pretty basic and, but we have big gaps.

Speaker 12:         01:25:15       Even like California, the richest state in the richest country in the history of the world. And yet, you know, we have kind of a big problems that are chronic, um, up and down the state. And so I think what we can do as a private group is we're not political, we're not religious, but just deal with the people that we know are deeply committed in their own communities and try to say, look, how can we help? Let's see if we can put together a structure that's going to serve you well and get your patients stuff that we know they can't afford. Cause it's expensive, whether it's insulin or an inhaler, things that if you don't have, you will get sick, stay sicker, skits, stay sicker longer and often die sooner then just because of your financial status. And I don't think anyone wants that, but, um, you know, I think we just are so committed to really help these, you see these people up in beauty.

Speaker 12:         01:26:07       Like they were reluctant and we said, look, we've received money. This is for you. We want to spend to give you $50,000. Cause I personally was up there, I delivered the insulin when they needed it. I drove up there and um, and I wanted to see them and let them know. It's like, look, there's a lot of people pulling for you and this is what we can do. But you know, we said, look, how are you paying for this? You guys are working for free. And they said, oh, but you know, we're okay. That seems like too much money, you know, $50,000 to, you know, take care of a, basically a standup hospital and clinic for hundreds of people who had no other options. So, I mean, they were really reluctant to take it. And we said, look, it's for you. We have to give it to you were a trustee. But that reluctance of, um, kind of acceptance because you know, the concern that there may be someone else who needs it more was, you know, quite touching and inspiring and sad and a lot of ways too. So anyway, it's, it's a privilege for us to do it and to have people like you and your audiences and I'll, you know, amazingly talented people on the creative side. Um, it means a lot to pull together and help folks like that. And so anyway, sorry, that was a long answer.

Speaker 12:         01:27:23       I appreciate it though

Speaker 2:          01:27:26       here that the idea that the money is going to is actually going to be legitimately on the front lines and helping a bunch of people. Like, I dunno when I'm donating to something like this, I'm like, ah, what's going on? We're all very cynical and skeptical in this world that actually get you on the phone and hear it. They can hear your music is very powerful and we thank you for what you do and we thank you so much for calling in and uh, we wish you guys all the best and I'm just thanks for being the best, the best of us.

Speaker 12:         01:27:58       Well, thank you. I really, I got to tell you, and I'm talking to you, right? Tony, Tony or communication guy. He kept running in here first is laughing and then increasingly nervous giving me little notes about like I wrote down, I have the following written down, which is weird for me. Fart bombs, question, market commission, raking over the coals and then some other things. I can't, can't recall the nature of my job but I thought I'm freaking out. I just thought these guys, I mean we know you guys, you've done some stuff for us in the past and uh, so I'm so thankful and whatever it is you're talking about, he also said there were, we were looking hot pepper, so please health related organization please don't get hurt.

Speaker 2:          01:28:40       Well one of us gets hurt for the safety of thousands. It's a, it's the least we could do as you're out there doing the actual hard work and I don't know if you have the stream open right now, but this, uh, this young man in the Santa suit here is about too, is very close to our next goal of eating this raw habanero pepper. So we're to need his, your blessings

Don't take a triple dare you know, but thank you for all you've got to stop out there, Joey. Yes.

It could be writing in there, there might be notes in there. I just grabbed it. I was like, I was like, cause we keep everything. So like that's a drafted, someone had it at the record. There were multiple records. So I don't know. What do you think there's any differences in this draft between the this, and that's the other thing is these scripts are going to be different than the episodes that air, cause they're in production.

Speaker 8:          01:34:43       So there's going to be dialogue in here that no one's ever seen before. Different jokes that you tried it. I've never been out there. It probably the biggest, like there's another one, uh, the, the um, uh, wasteland episode. What, what's it called? I Dunno. But like there's another script that's like going to be significantly different than what era then one went through a lot of changes in production. Pretty sure. Yeah. So these are original scripts did a bit on some of these. I'm curious about what's in there. That alone is like kind of amazing. I never get to see that. Go over to the prizes. Don't do it for the chair. He'd do it to win this incredible shit. Where's that skateboard deck? So I want to show that because you're very passionate about those.

Haven't gotten to go to the bathroom. We'll wait here. I got a question for Justin because I was thinking about this the other day cause I went into one of those like, stores that like sell like a bunch of like random shit from TV. Like when you guys make rick and Morty, do you think about merchandise when you're making it or is it just something that happens? Um, I think, I mean I have a very sort of toyetic approach. I hate to use that word because it's so lame. You are toys and you love your love toys.

Speaker 7:          01:39:33       I have a very full of toys. Your offices full of toys. I over did that. But whatever. Um, yeah I have like a, I have a, I have a toyetic approach to design. So like I, I grew up loving toys. Yeah, I'm obsessed. I've been obsessed with toys. He has a lot of like merchant, it's what it was like for, for example, like season one, we didn't know that that was going to be the case. You know, like no idea but still hoped best. Like best case dream is to have is to have a single Rick Dahl is, yeah, but, but, but, but I guess it's sort of like by default my design sense is like designing things to feel like they, like they would make cool toy, you know, like every character has that feeling, you know, like that's, that's the holy grail is if you can design characters that would make cool action, figure it out.

Speaker 7:          01:40:17       Then now I'm on the same principles that make a good cartoon design. Make a good toy. Like something that's simple, that's bold there reads from a mile away that clear in silhouette entertaining, interesting contrasting shape demand. If you're making a fucking cartoon, it's probably also going to be something that's like really catchy as a toy. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. Yeah. For character design for sure. Um, yeah. All those rules apply for good toy design. So yeah, it's interesting. It's, but I don't think it's been outright, I mean they're there, believe me, there's times where I'm thinking about like, Oh man, like, like, you know, certain things like rick's gone or like, I like the portal gun was definitely not a thing. We were thinking about a toy for when we made that. You probably, that made it a little bit like fancier. It's, yeah, totally aliens of them. You'd like make it a little bit. That was definitely one that was not even considered. But um, but yeah, but, but a lot, but there's, there's been certain characters, I'm trying to think of like a specific thing I think that I think is gone maybe or just a choice to like use a certain gun a bunch of times or like go back. Like we have so many guns design and it's like, Oh lets some of the cock sucker put $1,000 on me.

Speaker 7:          01:41:30       It wasn't me, wasn't me saying I'm just trying to make this a little interesting man. Spiring to uh, two out to vote you off the island double agent man. My God, Alex is sitting pretty at 30 hour. Alex Alex is good. I'm happy with this guy. Joe. You can put down a thousand on Alex. I'm kidding you two D monetize it.

One of them's a sketch card by me, which is, those are going to be really, I don't think there's, I think there's, I don't know how many there are, but there's not a lot I like, literally there's not a lot of them. And then there's also an autograph card, which also not a lot, um, mixed into the decks or into the packs. You know the, the blind, it's like trading cards, you know what I mean? Oh Hey little guy. Um, so uh, that's, that's also up there. What else? What other cool shit is up there? I guess that's probably about it. There's so many rewards including for all the guys who just want to get something bad ass. This Christmas ps four pro and xbox x switch bundles all up there. Yes. Justin did you brick cause you had pet?

Speaker 8:          01:44:38       Oh is that what that should be? Part of the thing that's by itself that is going to, that's not rare. It's not, well I mean maybe justin either. Justin is trying to play it up now, but I was like why? Why are we putting a rick she pet bites. Well that's why I know, I was like can we bundle this stuff too? Like no, no. Cause you could take all the, all the donations for the ric Chia pet and pull it in to what the bundle that then the one guy's like, I just want the ric cheap. They still limited. How long would the other, I have a Rick Chia pet. I don't know. By Justin reuland. Oh, I don't know. Zero I guess. Yeah, let's hope there's also uh, uh, the squanch games or trover saves the universe pack. Is that up there? Oh, it's five.

Speaker 8:          01:45:23       The, the bidding is over. Yes. Did you want to continue? So let's going up there. No, we'll wait until it gets goes up. So the pole that our first poll has completed and then Ethan somehow thanks to Alex, I'm sure a double agent anonymous donation a moment ago. Can you put it up? Yeah, let's see. The final tally. That wasn't me. I, you say a moment ago, you're talking about when Alex was on his phone, right? Weird coincidence was on my phone, but I was not doing that. I promise I was too. Right. Alex, you wise guy. So, but there you go. We just raised three. Like what? I mean that's like 2000 right there.

Speaker 8:          01:46:07       Almost three almost. Great. Well, it looks like you got to look that pepper. So we are at, okay, well let's, let's create the next bowl. You crying over licking it? Giovan munched a tasty little Jalapeno. All right. Yeah, I got ready to eat anything reading this. I'm going to end up with more spice in my mouth. Then you are, oh, James Wean Hoff gave us 1,100 wait, we're not missing any big donations. Are We? You guys able to, okay, thank you. Oh, this is like real time donations coming in. Yeah. Oh that's, that's really cool. Again, you guys don't have to donate separate raffles. If you

Speaker 7:          01:46:49       donate $1 separately, it doesn't increase your chance of winning anything. Oh yeah. You could donate, like you're saying, like if you did, if you did a dollar 20 different times on one thing, same as 20 pinging around like do a dollar and this one I'm going to, that's why I was saying bundle some of the ship. There was a lot of confusion about the, yeah, I don't know how. I don't know. Really. I wonder if you're still trying to change the rule. What if we could raise the mammo because all these $1 guys are killing it. Okay, that's fine. No, no, no. That's their, their odds are less, but like they're still able to participate. All right. Thank you for all your work the h three team has done in this livestream and podcast. Happy. See Isla Ethan putting out great content on the h three sheet page. That's the luck with your baby, Papa. Bless. Thank you Wayne. Why in, Huh?

Speaker 5:          01:47:35       Well that ain't, did he, um, was that a poll donation or was that just a random thing then I'll go check. I'm not sure what that was. All right. Well regardless, I have to, it's the liquor pepper now. So we've got the Carolina reaper. No, I'm going to choose one. Oh my God. It says Carolina reaper. What are you doing? Okay, so all right. Yeah, it does. You're right. Oh my God. Do you want it right now? Threader yeah. Do we have gloves? Yeah, let's turn up that pepper music. Yeah. Turn the pepper music. Jumanji Hanson that have shredder. Like Lick my hand. Oh yeah. Be Real good. It's a good point. You're going to want it. You're gonna want to wear gloves while you, uh, guys, let's think of a new poll before I do this so we can get things moving so we can raise some cheddar cheese. Is there anything I can donate? Let's see. Let's see. Let's see guys, we're at 37,000. Wait to the next goal.

Speaker 7:          01:48:30       Oh, come on. Come on for crazy. Why don't we do a thing where, well nevermind, actually, were you about to suggest something that would require you to look something? No, no, no. I was, I was going to say what would it be possible to rather than a pole. I was thinking like maybe the next person who donates x amount, like decides what you draw or something like that. You know what I mean? Like sure, sure. Yeah. You're way better at like, like Improv draw. Like, I just do. I like drag weird stuff that I, if we were trying to think of something that was valuable that people would want to donate for it probably be probably be a message from our old buddy Rick Sanchez. Right. Seems like that seems that seems like that around and give it a smell. You're touching it. Oh Dude, I already touched with my finger. It's super

Speaker 5:          01:49:12       dry. So Sma, everyone's pass that around and give it to pass it around.

Speaker 7:          01:49:16       Mallet

Speaker 14:         01:49:21       smell.

Speaker 7:          01:49:24       Okay, well I did this art. It's either, is this skin spicy though? This is either going up for auction or, or Ethan's swiping it. All right, well I'll tell you what do you call those Bros? Cause let me tell you what I'm gonna do with this because I don't know, like I don't know how many more I'll, I'll do more, but like,

Speaker 5:          01:49:41       let me tell you what's going on with this either. I'm getting this for $1,000. If somebody, doesn't this be a straight purchase?

Speaker 7:          01:49:48       No, no, no. Everything should be, it's mine. Like me money or less money. Everybody still be raffled is all the original art up right now on the donation. Thousand Bucks, man, right now when you're holding isn't up yet. But look at this. This is freaking incredible, dude. And I will eat it. Let's not go overboard. All right. Do you want, do you want it though? I do want because your mom already donated. He's not going to appreciate this. Well I'll drop whatever she wants. Whatever you want. Okay. Yeah, I'll draw something cool. I don't, I think she just wants like a little, well let's show rick and morty. Let's put that up. You know what? We have that chat, that chat stream. Wait, listen, if you donate a dollar, can you put a comment next to it? Yeah. That's how we can get a chat stream going.

Speaker 7:          01:50:37       So why don't we put that up. Okay, good. Okay. And then why don't we ask the people who are donating a dollar, do you, should we add this on the thing to be like a raffle? Like, should we add this stupid thing as around, I'll do as many $1 donation as I like to show how people can donate. W What are people choosing? That word is asking. We're just asking like do they want, do they want, Oh, next year there should be a way to pick many raffles and have one transaction. Oh we need a new, we need a new port. We need a new poll. How about the next bull? Someone has to take a nip, like actually eat a little piece of it. Did you hear that though? He said he's somebody posted a comment saying next year there should be no way. Oh yeah, you're going to probably need some milk.

Speaker 7:          01:51:23       They saying that next year there should probably be a way to donate to multiple with one transaction. So you like add to cart, add to cart, add on our head. That functionality exists on, on the site. Well we'll have to get on it until the whatever the next poll. A little nibble. A little nibble. Come on. No, maybe you should know before I go. Here I go. I'm looking at this. Okay guys, we watch. I'm nervous for you because I know we're about to see. I've just going to touch it on my tongue is that is definitely, I think you're looking at when you have this up in the background, people are, it's going crazy. Damn. What? Stick that all the way, right click and give it a good good lift. Oh my God. Yeah. That's a good lik, oh my God. Oh, what's up? What you want to show some stuff?

Speaker 7:          01:52:06       I rubbed it on my tongue and it was like immediately like a lot of pain. He's still tasting it like, like where are you at? Just hit me. Oh my God. Okay. Yeah. I'm curious. The Carolina ghost pepper in your mouth. The doctor's office. Smiley faces. Like, like chart what number? No, it's not, it's not very, well I can't say because it's actually getting worse. It's still, it's still working its way into your already going for the milk though. You're like not even letting it get to it's, I mean I was, all I did was kind of rub it on my tongue and I was shocked by it. Like immediately blasted.

Speaker 8:          01:52:46       Show your, we're not even going to get there. We'll be lucky if we even, it gets you to eat a fucking, let's do another poll for that. Joey's solids flew here and you guys can't even get him to eat a hobby narrow. I want to, I want to get to the Habanero Habanero quicker. People are saying add the drawing as a raffle. See, look, people want the drunk. Let Ethan keep the drawing. It's all over the place. Someone's gave $5 just to let me keep it. Everybody's saying raffle it and one said I'm missing from the rewards. Whoa. What does that mean? What does that mean? Oh No, she'd be at the bottom. I just looked this up there. Yo, what the fuck? What the fuck? We're not getting donations. Oh yeah. Why? Hey Joey's not on the thing anymore. Huh? What's going on here? I took it down for a second cause uh, cause we're backed up on his Oh okay. We got, we got to go send someone in here with a sharpie. All right. Give me a second. Full time. Right all day. And don't take it down either. Brought some, yeah. Don't take it down. Either. Brought these decks.

Speaker 15:         01:53:49       I Dunno. I thought we should show some of the stuff cause I'm the pictures maybe don't show how cool it is. Definitely don't. So this is, this is two of them. Yup. Of the, of the new, um, primitive decks. Oops. And then the back is like different or like different color. It's cool. There's also, I think, see, I don't think there is any grip tape and on this is the other two. Whoa, Whoa, whoa. There we go. And uh, again, like interesting. Yeah. These are, these are, these are really cool looking in person. I mean it's like the, it's like foil. It's like a foil back. But yeah. So the whole set and then I'm gonna look through

Speaker 8:          01:54:33       these scripts and actually see for myself, dude, Justin, should we do a thing where if these are old people can request what you draw next with their comment? No. You, you, me. Yeah. Yeah. Way Better at that than I can't see. Um, okay. Uh, how, how do we set it up, I guess? Uh, even how do I set it up if I'm trying to get people to request a drawing for me? Like it's just this I'm, and then just look at it. Just like, all right guys, I guess a donate a dollar to suggest what I should draw an almost 40,000. God don't arable here or boards could, I mean you could choose what I draw. I would say 50 bucks. We'll consider your suggestion. If it's over 50 bucks. I mean if it's, if it's 50 bucks, I'll, I'll do it. Um, let's see. Let's see what people will ask for 50 bucks.

Speaker 8:          01:55:16       The first $50 gets to, gets to pick. All right, well we'll keep it up. Keep it up by the time this is a relatively like, like this draft is pretty close to what ended up on screen, but I know that there's change or like I'm seeing that there's change though. I took a little lick and I'm feeling fine now. Okay. Now, by the way, a pay. A lot of people have been donating to joey and to write on my face. We're backed up, but we're working on it. We're sending people in. They're going to be working the faces. We

Speaker 3:          01:55:44       got to, we got to do right by you. We're working on it. Please be patient. Joey, please be patient with us and you got to, you got a $50 donation for. What'd you drew? I think, let me see. Let me, I can scroll back down. Whereas it, Alex, I think you're cool. I don't watch your show, but I will. I like that. Oh, that's sweet. I like, I like someone just being a fan of just me as a human. I can't, I can't scroll up. It's just zipping right by. That's kind of the sweetest thing. Anyone, anyone can really say. I have no idea what you do or what your value is in this world, but I'm a fan. Joey, why don't you give this a lik I'm totally fine now. I just want you, you want to look a different one, Mr. I don't know. You don't want to have anything to do with it. I just want to, okay, get it done and over with. Next poll y'all. Next poll. I think so. The next, the next Paul Ladies. Okay. Here. Look, look, look, look. These are the script.

Speaker 3:          01:56:38       We read out a line. Would you like to talk a bit about this? Do you want me to hold it? No, I'm just showing it. What would you like me to do? Rick and Morty, the abcs of Beth by Mike mcmann episode three Oh eight. Well by Justin reuland and Dan harmon up next original original, uh, going through those and I'm noticing that they're a little broad more sketch and he grabbing false Terry Walls fans is the actual [inaudible]. So hold on one sec. I need to draw. Those are legitimately, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no drawing. Let me draw something. I did see someone asked me to draw. You guys don't want to style. I think we should both draw ethan. He was joking, but we good. What our prediction is, get in here now. Now, Dan or somebody, if Mitchell can say it or you, if you have the person who, who donated for the writing, we need the names.

Speaker 3:          01:57:40       Go ahead and get the names or Dan can read them as your, as your, uh, writing them. Let's go ahead and go back to you. The names are, we have Ashley Marie dbs student who may or may not have asked, uh, to write the whole pepper, but we're doing it regardless. And a Matt Westcott. So you three thank you so much. Thank all our donation each getting their start right. And God dammit. All right. I'm taking the request to draw it, Ethan, and he was child. I'm, if anybody has any suggestions about what that drawing should look like, a donate and say some suggestions, but uh, I know what's going to have the combined aura of the both of you to somehow, all right, I'll get this out. Is it, I guess I should, should I draw it? It's like an adult. Like what? It's going to turn it? Yeah, just like, yeah, cause a baby's just like, all right, I can't really like dunk on a baby. I mean you could try it, whatever you're like. Okay. I'll do both guys. Here's the next poll. Okay. Here's the next poll though. Loser of the next poll has to eat this flake. You see that?

Speaker 8:          01:59:43       Keep eating. Yeah, I just saw it. Okay, so Dan, let's make a new poll. Okay. This is, this is one flake torn. Is this lame or is this good? No, I think that's good. A whole flake if just looking at made your whole mouth on fire for a minute. I think of like as a pretty good and I think that you should have to like chew it and kind of enjoy the joy and following that likes to put it on your tongue like a drop acid. You know what I'm saying? Oh yeah, I know what you're saying. Let it do its thing. The bottoms, the worst part. Do you know that very well? Yeah. I'm just trying to figure out, trying to figure out how to combine your guys' faces here. Now Joey, you are famous for put, you are known in the gay community. Is that right for putting your Dick and hot dog buns and sharing pictures?

Speaker 8:          02:00:30       I've run into more gay friends than like my youtube fans. Mm hmm. And so do you get, do you get a lot of gay offers for Sec? Like are people interested and is that something you would ever consider if I needed to do it a full time job? Like selling my underwear? Yeah. Or like selling photos. I could easily have people offer to buy your underwear used or or do they prefer it? You want to use you and have you sold it ever? No. Why not considered it and I was all can make a quick line. They they ask me sometimes I'll feel like 40 50 bucks. Is that a good price for you? It doesn't cost me anything. Just got old underwear. I have a lot of ripped up on the way. That's true. Huh? Now do they want it kind of where we're at 40,000 I would make it fresh for them, you know, 41,000 almost now what you far in it? Would you have a streaks Jane?

We're doing the second the the winter.

Speaker 3:          02:01:40       I guess it is what it has to eat this flake of a Carolina reaper. Okay. All right. I feel like this is not that interesting. No. Yeah. What are you doing that's going to cost some real serious damage to somebody that's not interesting. I don't think we could do better. I feel like we could do better in severe pain. I did that before the show for noma. Wait, you ate a flake flake. Really? Okay. Oh sorry. Sorry. Um, I'm just going to eat this then because this shit is fucking boring and you're all a drawing. I'm not doing shit, so I'm going to eat this. You know what? No, I need, I need to see written the whole thing. I need to see a hundred dollar donation top donor replaced. He needs, someone's got to replace the top donor of $1,100 he said we'll eat that flight.

But I mean, I want to see what happens. Let's see. This is going to be brutal. Or are you holding it in your mouth and you know all your thoughts? Oh God, go vote. I growed up. I regretted it for 100 bucks is worth more than a hundred bucks. I thought we're going to do it. If somebody replaced the top, the top boat I want gave a Hyundai, but like I'm the only one that's going to eat a carolina reaper. This whole episode with Ed Joey Salads, underwear as a reward. We can do that. Yeah. I want us, I'd be interested in know how much that would embrace.

That's all right. I'm going to eat. I'm going to tear off a little tiny bit. These God damn fire core off a little couple of chunks and I'm like, God, I'm the only one. Oh my God. Alright, what's the next poll? All right. Wait, I got sucked in to taste. Got some art that I made. Oh, is that you suck in your opinion. Yeah, it's me. It's me being in my own mountain, so put it up. Oh my God, that's so spicy. Signed it. I'm really afraid of shredder. Getting a hold of one of these flicks. Yeah, be careful man. I'm just keeping it all right there. All right. I drew Ethan and he was baby. Let me sign this. Oh Wow. It looks just like, hey will you know it's weird. One of my old dogs, right? Got You. Don't want like dogs trueup like corners and shit. They still like this spray and it's like hot pepper spray.

Right, but I'm going to call her.

Speaker 11:         02:06:07       That's up.

Speaker 8:          02:06:11       We need a new cove. We need a new poll. What's the pull for crime and Justin was the pool.

Speaker 11:         02:06:18       Um, um, all right.

Speaker 8:          02:06:23       You're the creative guy. I mean, I'm trying to, I'm like scanning for ideas here. Let's see. Anybody, anybody in there. I have a good idea for a poll. What torture do you want to inject into our life for cash? If somebody, somebody makes a Paul. Wait, wait, what's the poll thing? It's like if this person has to do something, I feel like pulls into limited. I would rather say that Joey and Ethan will make out tongue kiss if, if somebody donates $1,500 no beats the top donor. No, and they've already agreed to it. Ethan is actually married, so, oh, okay. All right. How about the non-married guys here? I'm staying out of this. Yeah. You know what? You're right. That was a dumb idea. There's five people on Tumbler who already want to see all of us making out drawings of whatever you can imagine. Um, to see that pop up. All right. I don't know man. Like should it be spicy pep shit? This shit is real hot man. Well I want to get, we'll be careful with that shit back in cause I don't want shredder to get it. Well if it stays up there, he's not going to be a dog. Is that the fish skin?

Speaker 3:          02:07:36       Yeah, it's fish again.

Speaker 7:          02:07:37       Well I was trying to tell a story before. Oh go ahead. So, oh wow. So know what I'm saying is they have like this pepper spray that you spray on like woods so the dogs don't chew on it. Okay. Yeah. And my dog was like impervious to it and it, it was like straight up pepper spray that you said it was like a wolf dog seasoning seasoning. So she was licking at it the whole day. There you go. That's actually pretty good dude. Hasten oh my goodness. Good. That's a good mixture of like two of you. That's like a pretty incredible and can be, which in eyes and then he got ethan eyebrows going to town and then like a little baby food free food started wearing fresh. It's wearing teddy freshies repping this fresh immediately. What the Frick? That is so good. Yeah, it's cuts. It kind of debate. It's kind of disturbing. That's pretty good. We're going to have to compare when your baby's born, how close it is, which one of us is like. Got It. You got the drawing closest? Oh yeah, here. Sorry.

Speaker 3:          02:08:45       Yeah, lots. Lots. Heart. Okay, listen. The next, let's just do a poll. Yeah, go ahead Scott.

Speaker 7:          02:08:54       Okay, I'll tell you what, I'll drive it. Okay. Whoever, whoever gets the most donation on the next poll has to drive to the nearest blockbuster and rent a really embarrassing move. What do you guys think? What people want to hear Justin do the ric voice, man, that's the thing. You got to auction off, man. You Mind Justin? You know it seems like a, that's not a poultry level. Whoever gets the most money does the Rick Voice. Yeah, that's right. Heel has to do. Rick eat. Didn't man. Delicious.

Speaker 3:          02:09:25       Okay. It's gotta be spicy pepper thing, right? I don't know, but I don't want to outdo outdo joey. Like I'm over here eating Carolina reaper and Joey's sitting there like fucking on his phone. Okay. Where are we at? Where are we at with the donation? 40 2042 though we are getting close to that 50 man. Yeah, that's going to be entertaining. The 50 should be like after tongue kiss for the victims. The fuck is this. I love that. This is our chat stream. This is great. And we pull a prank call. Are we wanting to do that or is that a note? Was there any fallout from last year's prank call? It was all, no,

Speaker 7:          02:10:00       because that was one of the most incredible things I've ever seen. Like you know, it was sort of, it was, it was in good, good fun. It was all in. Good Fun. Well, we should have

Speaker 3:          02:10:10       donut, a drive where if we get a certain amount, I love that we're on the fly trying to set up a challenge for for that. What does that mean? 5,000 Oh, like little little challenges that fill the channel brand. Call Papa bless.

Speaker 7:          02:10:31       Oh, I don't know. Like it's, I feel like I, that's, that's, that's a, that's a scary path because there's all kinds of laws and shit, right? Aren't there? We were a little more cavalier about this last year. I think we were just drunk or like true. We are all very sober right now. Oh, I'll tell you what. I need to drink alcohol, you know, let's do a thing where it's like, you know, we all have to take shots or whatever. That's what was missing from this. This is the mystery ingredient. We got to give our baby fecal. Oh, I forgot about that. Yeah, he was, he was off the table for that. But the dream, but I think I've seen Ila about as drunk as well. Maybe not, but I've seen her pretty drunk and she's like exactly the same as she is sober. We go, we were just, we just put, just put three shots on the table and then we make that a challenge.

Speaker 7:          02:11:20       Whoever has the highest has to do all three. Oh God, three shots. Yeah, man, that'll get interesting. I didn't say of what can we just do a spicy pepper Schatz? I'll do it. I'll do it for free. I'll do it. We'll get some, get some drinks. Skype, bathroom. Be Right back. Oh, if someone, nobody drinks a glass of milk from the pool after, after joey goes, that's a good one. Oh God. That shot of the little shot of very nasty. But Hey, you know, if the money's there, you know what? That's the pole. That's the pole. That's the pole. Dan, did you hear that? Nope. What's up a poll? The four of us, same victims including Ian, Alex, myself and Justin, the, the Louis Low. We'll go in and instead of me has to take a shot of the milk from Joey's Katie Pool. Okay. Uh, Ian says he's lactose intolerant.

Speaker 7:          02:12:22       He's out. That's a bullshit. That's bullshit. And that's what he's saying. And get them, we need to get, we need to get a separate pool with lactaid or whatever. [inaudible] you for real. Are you for real getting out of this right now because of your lactose intolerance? Yeah. I should probably sit this one out. Come on in a shot of, it's not going to kill my do it for the fire. The people who it's going to be 50% shit and piss. God forbid in, he could get a little taste of milk. How about your whole house burned down and you have nothing left. Exactly. There. There's people out there that need this money. Put it in and the Po Ian, come on. Look at it. Slowly creep up. We're getting closer and closer to 50. We got to get to fuck it. We got to get all the way. Meanwhile, let's shoot the big cabinet. Joey, how do we, how do we do this? If someone drops a quick 10 grand, we'll ship them a bottle of my urine. I'm like, God, right now, nobody's gonna donate. Good Job Joey. If I see a $10,000 thing in there, you're eating the pepper man. Oh Man. Oh yeah. So, uh, let's see. I got a bunch of entertaining stuff here. Uh, yeah, let's look at some, I thought

Speaker 8:          02:13:32       some stuff. Hey everybody out there. Got Any, I'm sorry to interrupt. Anybody up there got any a ginger beer? Not Alcoholic. Just just, just good old sodie pop. I just want to split it. I just wanted your beer in this cup. I wish I could drown out the wine. Drink Ila or I should stay sober. What happens if he drinks? What happens? I turn into a Gremlin. Oh, like on the, like if you turned them on a drug, I'm on an antidepressant. Oh yeah. They don't drink. Yeah, I really want to, but you guys can get drunk. I'm like, what do you mean you try and do at Gremlin? Like the mixture is like I turned in like at Lackland Gremlins. Touch water and you start multiplying. Is that what it is? I thought they turned to evil. They're multiplying when they touch. Why did they turn evil at midnight?

Speaker 8:          02:14:14       Yes. If they've eaten before midnight. There's a lot of rules to that. There's so many rules, man. Gremlins is like, it's, it's, it's a lot of work. Owning your Gremlin. I have got our mcguire, I guess technically, but you guys keep the donations going. We're so close. Come the F on to my face guys. What's going? I love this podcast is just us like go and come on. I know this is not entertaining at all. Munching on Japanese snacks in front of the microphone is a little mushroom. I fucking awesome. Yeah, they're really delicious, right? A little cookie with a mushroom. And I'll tell you what, Japan does not fuck around when it comes to making snacks. Look a board. Julia is going to show her joy. Don't, don't change what you're doing right now. Just give God a shout of joy.

Speaker 8:          02:14:58       He's literally, this is so lame. We gotta get that pepper map. Okay, well let's talk about this three miles north of mold. Calm. Oh, here we go. You dug this one up. Only 420,000 views. Is that on a card? Actually, I don't know. I don't even know what I meant. The other video, I had a thousand views you showed. Yeah. Thank you for, thank you for noticing. Wait, no, what it did. Oh, the dog. One dog. We're getting held up. Okay. These are amazing. These are the best candy I've ever had. Yes. Salicious. Let's talk more about this. I think that every burger, which is another delicious Japanese treat candy, I don't think I brought one. Very good. Very good treat. Um, this is the worst. All right, and we're waiting for you. Alex is the worst. Just the worst. KIPP. So this year people have a spiritual retreat and Norway and this guy, oh Norway teaching them how to repel energy using their psychic power. Oh, I think I've be. Yes. And so he is kind of doing a demonstration. Is this from like a larger yes thing. Okay. Three miles north of, I don't know what it's called. Not here it is. So this is the instructor? Yes. Are you sure we haven't watched this touch? Can you come magnus,

Speaker 7:          02:16:30       I've seen this. I've seen so far because she was still out here on the podcast before. I do watch a video of you watching this. I'm afraid. Can we watch videos of people just destroying convenience stores after this? After this please. I know I've seen this before.

Speaker 7:          02:16:56       These poor people are one step away from being in a cult. What are they trying to do? They aren't if they aren't already, so he's teaching them how to repel. We needed the pole. When you're standing on the, on the, on the, on the edge of a lake doing this, you might need to ask, you might be in a call doing that rugby man's, if you're standing at the edge of a lake, per chanted up for Jack to energy on how other people by God, God, Geez. Oh Geez. While she tries to pull it off like he's having a seizure.

Speaker 7:          02:17:32       Oh Man. Somebody give this guy in the house. What was he trying to do? What was supposed to happen? You're juggling at the, he was going to pretend to be repelled, but they were goofing around and he tried to make a point. They show how real it is because is that blood? No, that was just like her shawl or something. Just gave her a tumble. Oh, now he's like, oh, come into like, oh, I just woke up. What happened? Oh, the spirit. Listen. He blames it on them. Watch. Where the fuck were you guys? Will you guys, I kind of want to give this guy my life savings in that follow him into the woods and where would he wears? Like a little cheese. He's healing or just by shaking his hands and, no, but that was like step aside, I'm the real good rule rollover. You idiot. I just act like she was shot. Yeah, come on. Take it easy. You're like, you're acting like somebody raining. Raining.

Speaker 7:          02:18:23       This is my favorite scam as being a faith healer who injures people and then tries to heal them. What you just did to them. It's like, I've crippled you now I'm going to make you stand like, you know. It's funny. It's like she's kind of having to, he might've broke her neck and he's like Jocelyn, her head now he knows. He's knows what he's doing. Suddenly he's better really hoping this shit turns out to be real. Well, it's part of his scan. He did it to show them is there a snake root that it comes all wrong. Yeah. Let's zoom in on these people. They're like, I wish these people would stop coming to this lake. Just trying to have a nice weekend. July. They keep ruining it.

Speaker 17:         02:19:03       Join us in the circle.

Speaker 7:          02:19:06       All right. Can you stop a Guy? Who can you feel your legs?

Speaker 17:         02:19:10       All right. Listen Lady. I love it. Huh?

Speaker 7:          02:19:19       You think youtube would have been the death of these types of people like that? They wouldn't get away with it, but it's just like somebody who's watching this right now, who's super it. I think these folks probably don't watch youtube. They probably are pretty disconnected. Deep emotion. That's probably part of the whole, she's quitting soon, but she has given up that it's her fault. She's really trying harder to not get body-slammed by this dude. I watched this whole documentary. This guy's like a enso. It's again, it's a getaway. They come together for like three weeks every year in Norway and this guy's all desperate. What are you? Are you going or did you sign up or you're going to go? Those days are behind me.

Speaker 7:          02:20:01       There's a ghost in here. Somebody let this guy out, so there you have it. I would just, I just wish she was stronger. She got injured and it's really her fault. She's pointing. Yeah. Tell him, look, you can bring in the mood down. She, she bombed everyone out by, you know, getting hurt when he rammed into her and I get it. It's like I'd be bummed too. You don't want someone shattering your weird culty belief system by being hurt to knocked over. You want them to like, you know, be like a god and and float or something when tackled by as a fully grown, ripped, fairly repeated gentlemen. Scientologists like when you go clear, you're supposed to have like perfect, like perfect mine, perfect spirit. You could like project your mind and like your entire body's balanced, but it's like, if that's the case, why was l Ron Hubbard have the grossest teeth in the entire world to his teeth looked like a right.

Speaker 7:          02:21:01       It's like right now I'm going to look like a gap. A gap is like an like a gap in your teeth. It was like a hot, that's like the hot, what's Madonna started doing it? Give it some time. Alan Hubbard teeth. They're going to be, that's going to be a thousand years. It's going to look going to be a thing and he's just so far ahead of training. He was like, he was like, I want my teeth to look like this. I fully believe that you could be a successful cult leader in a weird way. You kind of are feeling like, what do we got a better memory than mine? We got messages from, you guys can hit us up with some sound effects. What do we have for go sick? What are we play that message music for chattoway right in front of Joe you can use, we have a new thing that we can like so awesome for the pull up.

Speaker 7:          02:21:48       Throw the pole up, throw the pull up. Listen, Aussie is going to come and play whatever song people want her to play like completely awesome. So like, so we have to figure out a way to do that. So it's like if somebody bids or somebody donates x amount, like the same way we're doing this with like the face stuff. If somebody donates, like whatever the price is, then they can pick whatever song and she, she'll go in the other room, listen to it, figure it out and come back and play it. Cool. So she'll be here in like, I dunno, a half an hour or something. Should we order some pies? You guys hungry pies? I don't want to eat. No. God Damn Pie. You son of a bitch? No, no, no. A slice pizza. Yeah. Pizza. Yeah. I don't want to eat any meat. No. Why don't we, why don't we a order some pizza? I meant get some pizza. Get it from Domino's and give me that Goddamn Hawaiian pizza. Piss everyone off at some pizza and put up that God damn.

Speaker 18:         02:22:42       All right. But hold on. I got pizza. We should get, I got to read off these donors or writing on Joey and by the way, $100 to write on Joey too little money because they started coming in way too fast. Uh, so we have one from Anna, one that was anonymous, uh, one that is from Fuck Youtube, uh, one from motivation app, a one from Hunter Dutton. And one from blue harvest. And lastly, one from, uh, a WTF. Boom, dps. How are you?

Speaker 7:          02:23:15       Cool, thanks guys. Names. You did have a big a deal with adult swim. Where's that? $2. Finally, finally able to Justin Smiley donate it finally came through. Finally able to find a spot for, is it room on the floor? We'd go in the neck. The pole. Dan Is uh, is Ian not in it? Is He really not in it? Dan, would you be in it? What? Pool? Sure. Dan. Alex, meet Justin. What's the pole? The loser or a winner takes a shot of the, of the milk. Water. Well, I'm lactose intolerant. That's the pole. Throw it up for Christ's sake. No, I'll take a sip. I'll do a sip at most. So if you vote for me, get ready to be fucking disappointed. No, it's a shot as one measurable. No guys, it's 40th. Oh wait. I'll tell you someone get Justin Viagara my mic and me to, um, the uh, I was going to say like, I think that the, I think that if we're going to drink it, if, if, if we're going to put up a poll, let this be a pull that runs in the background all the way till the end of the fucking thing.

Speaker 7:          02:24:30       Because this should, this should also, by the way, if the pole, um, collectively doesn't raise pass a certain amount, we're all, we need to get a, we're off the hook because if it's like, oh, we raised $2,000. Now if someone has to take a shot of fucking joey milk, like I'm not going to be like, what are they doing that I wouldn't do that if somebody gave me $2,000. It's gotta be like the plus. There's nothing even gross about the joey milk. We can get the pinning. This guy's going to be sitting at an even sad it, he hasn't eaten anything more than a Jalapeno for Christ's sake. I mean, he flew up from New York, I believe. Anyways. You know what? Let, let me see if I can't do some stuff. I'm on. Oh, hey aussies almost here. Pull though. Maybe the polos up. Meet her at the stairs. Holes a office

Speaker 8:          02:25:24       here. If someone can meet her daughter. She's almost here. The poll is up. Who takes a shot of Joey Salads? Pool milk. Oof. No. One more. Let me see. Uh, who can I, how do I get this? This, how do I get this stream more widely distributed so we can get some more? Uh, yeah, we should do a second round. And the promotion got these motherfuckers out. There it is. He loves original article. Kanya I get it. Get it gets a retweet. He'd say Ilan, Mikaila connected. Has He launched a submarine over here? Either of those people, Ilan and say, Yo, I know you're probably free right now. Not a busy guy. Christ. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          02:26:09       when we get some drinks in here, hey, what's the, what's the drink's going on? Get some, uh, it was whispering the word drinks into the microphone. Opening drinks magically appear. Kid. Somebody out there bringing in much rank. I already got. I just went and made my own. I was like, I got, I need a drink. Um, what's the, what's the link to the podcast guys? Whoever just donate a dollar and post chat with the link to the, what is it? It's youtube. Did we have the president, uh, doing an interview or what? Oh, is, is, is, is President Donald Trump going to be president of the United States yourself? So many questions for president trump. If he's, if he's, uh, we need a pizza when he drinks, we need a president. Get the Hawaiian a ultimate from dominoes or whatever it's called. So it's youtube.com/slash hv podcast. You've told me that like four days on twitter, but there's a directly to cast, right? Yeah. Okay, so hold on. Okay, we got surprises throughout. Let's watch some more stuff. Some stuff. Here we go. Oh, did you guys know that Carlton is suing fortnight? No, I think that's a joke. No, it's real. It's from the guardian.com. Carlton, I'm telling you. What do you guys think about this fresh prince actor soon for using as iconic Carlton Day? I liked the guy, you know, I mean I think, I think he's, I think he's great.

Speaker 5:          02:27:33       It is his stance. But when does he expect the to get to here you go

Speaker 8:          02:27:37       watch the similarity.

Speaker 5:          02:27:40       It is slow. It's a straight up ripped off. Carl though. Is that

Speaker 8:          02:27:48       fallen? So the interesting question about this and they're not just ripping off well known dances. There's little people who have invented dances and dumb them very brilliantly at fortnight is frame for frame stealing their dances and now we're at, we're at like 45 k and then fort night is stealing their dances. Like frame for frame and getting famous. People are buying these dances. Yeah. By making money off these people property. Yes. They're making of money

Speaker 7:          02:28:22       and they're not credited. When's the last time you heard a legal case like you did my dance, but it's a, it's a new, it's an area. I think it's a brave new world. That's what, well here's, here's, here's the issue with that because if, let's just say he, I don't think he has any legal case for that, but let's say he wins at that point. What stops him from copywriting, all the videos of people doing the debts. You know what I mean? Between somebody who's monetize buckle and end just asking for like millions. No, really, you know what, here's why this is happening and I don't want to say about this. This is a bit, this is a bit of a different probably thing than what you were expecting to hear. That was a horribly constructed sentence. But um, I, this is, this is, this is proof that actors and people in the entertainment industry are not as rich as you think they are.

Speaker 7:          02:29:19       Number one, like you're telling me this guide and dancing with the stars isn't as rich as I think. Well, no, I'm just saying like everyone, like you see a guy on a couple of sitcoms and you're like, oh man, I can't even imagine what kind of mansion that person lives in. And the reality is you get paid sag scale. I'm sure that, um, what is the actor's name that played Carlton? I don't want to keep calling him Carlton and I feel like that's, what's his name? Shit I know is on it. You know, it's funny, even in his party phones Alphonso he, I know it from a, that that food show on, because even in this guardian article, they refer to him as the Prince French French actor. His name is Alfonzo. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. So Alfonso, it's like, you know, he probably made a good chunk of money and some residuals off of fresh prince and he's them host.

Speaker 7:          02:30:07       No, he did. I mean, he made a decent amount for sure. And then I've seen him host a couple of other shows and he's great. He's funny, like, you know, but that's just like the fact that he sees, well, first of all, he probably, he probably believes he's completely in the right. I mean it's, it's pretty much dead on. It's exactly what they referenced. This video. Yeah. That literally do it. So, yeah, I mean, I get it. It's like, I totally get it, but it's like, you know, if he was just flush with money, he wouldn't give a shit. He'd be like, yeah, I don't give a shit. But because fortnights taking billion a billion dollars a minute and it makes sense. Right. Because if this guy who's not that well off, it's like, oh, these guys, by the way, I'm just jumping to the assault. I think most people in the entertainment industry who are actors, they're not as rich as people think.

Speaker 7:          02:30:59       They are. Definitely. Particularly because the acting acting's, it's not a nine to five where you clock in every single day after your Gig is over. You're hustling, CIG, so between jobs, you know, if you're not getting residuals, you're literally not kidding. Hey, and by the way, a lot of times you're paid per episode, so we're working a whole year and going in every day, but you're only getting paid for each episode and each and every season, depending on how many episodes are in a season, it's like the tree are not really making that much. Very small amount of people in entertainment are actually rich. I, you know, it's so funny because I used to pull, you'll see on mainstream shows, actors that you see on huge shows on television are probably not even millionaires. No, not anymore. Not even in the 90s. It was like this big explosion of like there was money in them there hills, but now it's like, no, and I used to think like, oh man, that's where the money's at.

Speaker 7:          02:31:49       Uh, and it's like, yeah, I mean I feel like I'm more informed now. I'm like, wow. Yeah, there's not that much money and why he's not splitting the pizza. That's [inaudible] I saw you got two bucks. I know, but I, I have to tell you, where did you get them sharpies at? Sorry, go ahead. At the first, you know, at first I was saw that and I was like, oh great. You know, that's ridiculous and silly that they actually steal like frame for frame. Like it's not based on him. It is him. I didn't know they sell, did dance. They sell it. That's the thing. I it, I don't [inaudible] you, you play for night dial. They sell the dances. They saw the dances. But I don't know if some of them are for sale. Some of them you want lock. Would this change if it was an unlock or a free like right out of the gate does in my opinion.

Speaker 7:          02:32:46       But it change. It can change and anyone back there find out early, they could easily get a royalty. So it's like, I call this court to honor. Tell me, do this. No questions. What's the car? No, was it unlockable? Oh, it was available from the beginning of the game. It was such like a beautiful family disordered imagining that then you end to court by saying course the court disorder, but like to imagine anybody in a sort of legal authority and shit about technology. That was the night I've heard. Oh nine he did read it and dogpile. Dot. So it looks like I'm going to be drink pile would be so your worst nightmare come true and it looks like I'll be taking a shot at Joey's. No, no, no. This is what, this is what I'm going to say. If the collective total is not more than 10 grand, it's not happening.

Speaker 7:          02:33:46       Right. So get outta here. Everyone who already donated, I apologize. It's like, you know, you gotta you go to 7,000 so close to 40. How about how I'm giving another thousand so wait, when we get to 50 is only going to eat the yeah, the, the, the not even that. I think we got to change the rules. We can't choose the rules. We listened. We did. We not happening. I think we're going to go take it easy. I wanted to say something about Alfonso in this thing. Um, Dan, I don't need another thousand 3000 for anyone to see. Just to wrap this up. Donate it on the, on the baby Joe, which will drawing. Do I want, I'm going to bid on it. Fuck. So hold on real quick. I want the xbox. Dan Put it. I'm kidding. Just donate $1,000 because I'm freaking tired of this shit real quick.

Speaker 7:          02:34:40       I can I just say thank you Dan. I noticed something and I'm so out of the loop on this shit, but somehow I saw this and I didn't know what the fuck it was referring to. So thank you. Now I know the origins, the welcome, but I saw a thing where he admits to borrowing that dance from someone else. Oh, anyone caught up on this? You want to pull this one up? Cause like, well I'd rather you can use everything. Well yeah, because this is the dance that they stole. Well it depends if you went well. Yeah, no you're right. That's lit. You know what I mean? So the questions I have is, was the dance inspired by someone else's dad fired by something? Know what I the only question, literally the only question that matters to me right now and you guys in back should be able to help. What's this? What's this sole lawyer or a judge? I think if, if it does go to Cortland, say he wins, I think it opens up the door for like so much bad things with copyrights because it's similar. That wasn't my identical, right. They could made it similar and I think there's more to the dance. They could have like given him a royal. I think there's more to the dance though.

Speaker 7:          02:35:51       No, you there? I think it goes beyond grab seconds. At a sink with them. Yeah, look it up. There's a longer one that that shows more because if, if you can copyright dance moves, how far back? Why, why is her dancing in this game? What's the game? I've never played 49. My Life Justice. If you played fortnight from everything I've heard about it, it's got nothing to give. I feel like I shouldn't because my partner, uh, basketball, go watch games was executive producer of fortnights so I should, that's gotta be awkward that you haven't played a lot of it. I just, I haven't had a lot of time to play games lately. I'm making a game. Look at this guy. Um, I'm writing to TV or the NBA Two K as well.

Speaker 7:          02:36:39       You know, I, you know, listen, I don't know where I'm at on this. Like you've gone all the way around and look, this doesn't look that good at, it's hard to decide. I don't know. Well, no, they changed. They definitely energized it. That one's identical. Identical, but that's for fortnight again. But the, the, the, the NBA of those guys ever mine. Okay. Whatever. We've, we've, we, we, who are we to say, listen, I say, I say defer to Joe on this one. Yeah. Joey, what do you think? Let them have the money on in favor. I don't think he's going to let the guy have the money. 49,000 did you donate a thousand for me? Damn, I sure did. Thank you. That's why it jumps up. We're so

Speaker 10:         02:37:16       close. We're creeping and crawling. What are people saying? We're creeping and crawling on this.

Speaker 3:          02:37:23       Papa bless. Appreciate you guys. 25 pop pup. Pudi bluffs.

Speaker 10:         02:37:29       I mean it's rolling in. We got,

Speaker 3:          02:37:38       he said what else you got on the docket? I feel like that that's entertaining stuff. I feel like, Hey, yeah, let's keep watching. So I've keep looking at and having and talking about entertaining. Would you like to watch it later? That drinks on pit, would I? We have a pie on the way. We have many pies. Hawaiian for Justin, half Hawaiian guys. Oh wait, I want it all Hawaiian. Ooh. So apparently this poll is not doing shit for anybody because I'm going to have to drink his pissed and I get a string of that. So let's watch a lady drink on pit. Grabbed a little, rip it. Well, I need more leverage in that. There you go. Come on. Come on. You got this Justin. Where do you get this? Every time I go, Gosh, and talk to you as a weird Christian candies,

Speaker 10:         02:38:30       go to a Japanese store. Okay. Any Japanese store understands candy. They understand cartoons. They understand things that are appealing and [inaudible] and strange and novel. You know what else? They understand the art of the dopamine hit when you're opening a blind box item. Oh yeah, they, they do the best blind bond doing that forever. Well, before we even were like, but we were dabbling in blind box items 50 years after. They're like, it's so funny. And then, and then there's these lol surprise toys. Anyone know about these lol? They're 90% garbage and 10% toy, but it's all, it's, it's all like

Speaker 3:          02:39:07       perfect ratio. Yo, do you guys want to watch your lady drinker? I'm pissed. Yeah, I mean, why not? When in Rome or here? I mean, well, if you want to watch the lady drink you a Piss, y'all better fucking donate. Oh, we're close. We're close. We're close. Somebody kicked in. Somebody can, cannot believe James Wiener is still our top donor. I should have donated over more. So I get the spot. James Wine, Huh? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Be Cool. Yeah. Yeah. Whatever. He is our top down. Yeah. I guess I should be more

Speaker 10:         02:39:42       and actually he's donated, uh, several other times for a bunch of the items in like $500 blocks. So I think he, he's kicked in probably three or four grand at this point. So that guy's a hero.

Speaker 3:          02:39:55       Yeah. All right. Let's watch a lady drink her own test. And by the time this is done, I fricking better see that be a 50 k and then hopefully that's entertaining enough that we go up to 75 get Mr Beeston. Where's the, where's miss? Should be eating it. Yeah.

You need to figure out exactly how torture the people in this room and equal terms equally torturing to all, all of us had a good idea of like a competition, like some sort of competition and, and how do we monetize that? Again, I can't even remember. Thank you. I mean if we were just playing any kind of game, we could just put down money. We would pass. We would bet her own hard earned money on it.

Speaker 21:         03:08:12       Yeah, I'm, I'm watching Carrie and 50 years old. I'm from Colorado. I'm watching drinking my urine break. Your color, your vitamin D vitamins, that's for sure. It's easier to drink than water. They drink the water. Carry all the liquid is all easy streets.

Speaker 7:          03:08:34       Well, uh, well, you know, I would disagree with that. You consider, uh, you know, first flyer viscosity. All right. All right. You got this. Gostudy are fine. I mean, saltwater is not, you know, Alex frankly, speaker

Speaker 21:         03:08:48       my building the largest one or yarn morning. Now she consumes up to five glasses every day. You know, I feel like I'm wasting

Speaker 7:          03:08:55       great urinary. No, this is great. No, no, keep going. I'm sorry. I'm buckled this big common buckle. Then let's go ahead and buckle down. I'm here to get eight glasses a day. I heard that eight eight, eight oh nine. She is addicted to it, but it looks like she's suffering when she drank. Well, let's listen to her. Listen guys, let's, let's see. Let's go over this. Let's listen for a minute and see where we are. Where we're buddy. Focus right on it, dude. Drinking your own year. Let's see where we're at with her. All right, everybody ready? Okay.

Speaker 21:         03:09:24       It's comforting. It don't make fun of this moment. I'm trying to make sense of it all. The first time I drank my year and I didn't throw out and it wasn't horrible. So I thought you trusted can do this. So

Speaker 7:          03:09:46       you know what the first time I drank my urine, not bad. I didn't throw up. I can do this. Yeah. So

Speaker 8:          03:09:54       I have a couple of questions. Why, why did you, why did you, what, what I, if she was here, I'd go, well, what, like very respectfully, why did you want to drink your own urine? Good. Um, I think she was doing it as some health kick. She's like, Oh, I saw it somewhere. I was at the, I was at the corner of a lake or like at the edge of a lake and a charity stream. Dude, she was just like us. This is what it escalates to get joey to drink his own piss her front. Oh, free sleep. Her making that kind of money. I mean if it's this easy for her, well Joey's piston his mouth famously, but if he goes to the bathroom contract with a jar, piss would we kicked down to watch them drink? Thank you too, but just would shut the street down.

Speaker 8:          03:10:37       He hasn't done one show deck is just, he comes down with the yellow. I mean we're watching her drink piss. What's the difference? I mean, listen, I leave it up to the audience and uh, you know, pay with your wallets or what is it a vote with your wallets? I mean, do, who wants to Wash Joey? Let's do a poll. Let's do a poll. Well wait, hold on. Can I get back to this? Like what? What on, hold on. I want to, do you want joey to drink his own piss? Yes or yes or no? Thanks. Joe Even agreed to this. He just said, I'm not doing it. That going to poll, you know, drink his pool water. But the problem is I'm not doing it unless the entirety of this bowl hits like fucking 50 grand or 40 grand, which is, you know jody not going to happen. Will you ask him? I did. He said No. He said, hell no. He said he hasn't done that in years. He's over it. He hasn't done that fast. No, no. Better time than now. Dog grown up to know what can we get a bike joey?

Speaker 14:         03:11:38       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          03:11:38       Yeah. Once you drink tasting your own piss here. No. I'll let her know. How much for you to drink your own person today. That's not happening. I'm not seeing stuff still. It's like fucking pissing me off. Dan, are you making an equivalence between me drinking my own piss and Joey Salads? I mean the guy's, he's a known mouth. Buser he said no, so I was seeing if you'd be down. Are you down to drink your on pissed? Absolutely not. Okay. Well obviously you don't care about burn victims. We got pizza here. Standby. Yeah, it tasted it did four years ago. Sometimes the southgate, champaign, sometimes it tastes like champagne. Sometimes it tastes like lemon.

Speaker 8:          03:12:33       I liked this raw shit in my mouth. I want to know why. I want to like why she started like what got her start like what was the day where she was like, I'm going to do this here. Listen to this quote of her saying, you know, I tried, it wasn't so bad. I can do this. I can do this. It's a health kick. It is. Yeah. There's a whole counter or there's a whole help saying that, but I'm telling you, there's a bunch of pissed drinkers out there. She's not the only one. Rain. Florence is another one. Yeah. And will you enjoy this?

Speaker 21:         03:13:07       Maybe a little lemony, a little lemonade. You can taste different things going through your bodies. There are certain things. I don't like to eat it anymore because they know it tastes good. Oh, you mean like this? Love, love, love asparagus. I won't need it. And he gets, nope, it makes the hearing tasting.

Speaker 8:          03:13:26       I'll take a Hawaiian Hawaiian. Yeah, a pizza already a flavor Hawaiian. Oh, we have cheese, we have mushroom, the works. I'll just take a slice a, what do you guys want? Yeah, I mean we can come out and grab a slice till two. Yeah. Uh, yeah. We'll just come up. We'll just, yeah, whatever. Flex the cheese.

Speaker 21:         03:13:46       Yeah.

Speaker 8:          03:13:48       Well we really hit a low point on the street. Everyone's just sitting here. I focused on this drawing. She's got a daughter. You guys, her daughter's going to comment on the piss. Drinking show the drawing. All right. I'm watching this piss video y'all can do it.

Speaker 21:         03:14:05       Body has decided to filter through and get, get rid of. So it doesn't seem healthy to me that to put that back into your body.

Speaker 22:         03:14:13       Yeah. Carrie doesn't drink urine just because she loves the taste. Her addiction began two years after being diagnosed with cancer.

Speaker 8:          03:14:22       Really diagnosed with one of the, of course, the number one a month. Got It. Got It. That's of course the, uh, the doctor recommended. That's just a sign of how fucking loss we are as a species when it comes to something as horrible as cancer. It's like, yeah. It's like, I'll just, I have, I guess I'll fucking drink my piss then. I mean, it's like, okay, what else am I going to do? Maybe that'll work. I mean, that's just fucking depressed. Really sad spin on this story. Well, I believe Justin, she's cured and she's still drinking her peers. All right, so don't be too sad. Oh, she loves it.

Speaker 21:         03:15:05       Stage three and they took out 16 of my lymph nodes found cancer in three of them and do this and they told me with the chemo I'd have a year to now.

Speaker 22:         03:15:18       Carrie decided against chemo instead turning to urine therapy. Is it working ancient and long discounted practice to maintain health ancient and long discounted.

Speaker 23:         03:15:28       Okay.

Speaker 8:          03:15:29       Is it,

Speaker 22:         03:15:30       does it work for four years later? She still uses it to five years later. He's crushing it. She's alive. She has never consulted a physician about her unorthodox treat.

Speaker 8:          03:15:39       Wouldn't that be funny if the cure of cancer was just actually this whole time drinking your own piss, it sounds like that's what they're saying. Yeah. They couldn't put it on tv, but it wasn't true. Here we go. This is, this is your pocket, John Right here. He's admitted. He's devouring this. We're drippy pizza. Alex tried to capture his stolen. I tried to capture like, he's like a wrestler. What was happening inside his heart but devouring his own pizza. There it is. This like a play on like a saturn devouring his son plastic for all your art or art fans out there is amazing. Wow. Is this this right here, dude. That's amazing. Bring in mind close. Sorry. Yeah, sorry. Yeah, yeah, that. Wow. That is incredible. That is so for someone in the Papa John's family is going to be bidding on that [inaudible] himself. Man. John's going to want that above his mantle. It's going to remind him of the power he gets from eating his own pizza. It's can remind him of how high he's climbed, how far he's fallen. Oh yeah. One of these. So much art to sketches. We got a karaoke machine there, right? Yeah. We gotta be doing Karaoke. We gotta be doing care. Rio. Can you want to sing it? You want to sing with me?

Speaker 8:          03:16:58       So what's the deal? How do we get people to pay $500 you named the person on the list like people are, people are, people are able to donate and she'll learn whatever song, um, $500 you named the song, you name the person. I think that's $500. You understand? You hear that? What if, what if the person doesn't know the song? They just have to wing it. Well, we can probably pull up the lyric. Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's right. We'll just find a karaoke video. Yeah, exactly. All right. We're doing this. I'm in, I'm in on this and I'll sing any songs for 500 bucks for charity. Absolutely. Dan. Hey, 500 bucks. Sing any song. And they get to choose. They choose the person in the song person. And we doing this instead of for Ozzie to come in and in a company. Well, this is an addition. This is an addition. Oh, this is an addition. Okay. Yeah. Oh, copywriter. Yeah. I mean, that's why I was asking you what are you gonna get the music exactly. Oh, like, like do, do the music, you know? Oh yeah, yeah. Ruined the of the rules work. Fuck yeah, good point. Good point.

Speaker 11:         03:22:19       Okay.

Speaker 6:          03:22:22       Tony's in the mic. I said, know what man? We got it. We got beloved. I mean we're in personalities. We're and so deep on fine eating pizza and there's been a lot of trying to figure out what this is on the flight. We're kind of building the plane while we're flying it a little bit here. He could sing and I, while we can't talk. Well, how about, okay, Cigna, old man by Neil Young. Bam. Why don't we bring us, he and Brian to come in and she here? Yeah, she's here, but I got her set up. Let's bring her in and does, does this Mike g work? Is this on? No, that one doesn't work. We'll have to pull it. I'll, I'll come in and get her set up. Okay. Hey, little blooper.

Speaker 11:         03:23:06       Okay.

Speaker 6:          03:23:06       The book, donate him. Alex called Disney. Yeah. I just, I dial one 800 Disney. I'm just like, Hey, thank you for the television show up by the very polite and respectful. You tell me more about working for Disney because I always hear awful thing. No, I mean, here's the thing, like trying to talk about Disney is like trying to talk about an entire country. Like it's such a huge company that like if somebody be like, Oh man, you know, I was, it'd be like trying to talk about Google. It's like, well what? Yeah, which department? But there's the park, there's TV, there's movies, there's interactive. Like I mean for me, like I was just working for the kids channel and like the main problems weren't Disney's fault. They were my fault for trying to work at a kid's channel. Cause like that's not how my brain naturally works.

Speaker 6:          03:23:47       And it was like one of these things where they're like, oh, we're going to pick up your show and I'm like Rad. And then I was like, oh no, they won't let me use any of the funny parts. Do you have a good example? Is aware of stuff you would fight? Like hell yeah, no, I mean we, um, for, for my wrap party, for gravity falls, I printed out a giant list of all the most bullshit snp notes that we ever got and I just, we did a dramatic reading of them. We had like somebody playing the Moonlight Sonata in the background because it was so depressing and I was like, I read my butt back and forth and somebody else read that cause like I, I started out with this idea at the beginning of the channel. Like, okay, it's a, it's a conversation. We're going to do our best, you know, if they have a disagreement, we'll try to hash it out and I'm going to be respectful and by the end I would just be like, I'm not changing.

Speaker 6:          03:24:29       Like I've got, like if you'd just like flip through all of the emails, you'd see a man slowly losing his mind because they would just ask for the dumbest, craziest bullshit. Like, um, oh my God, where do I even begin? Like every puddle, every shape, every Bush, every, every cloud, every puddle, they'd be like, let's looks like a dick. Wow. Yeah. Well, it's like if you're an s you're looking for day, their job, it's like you're going to cost you. It's like you have to write a ticket. You know what I mean? Like they've got a quota, they got to find these problems. Even if they don't exist, that's what, that's their job is like, see dicks were dicks don't exist. Right. So like constantly having to just like feel these questions, they'd be like, is that a secret deck? I'd be like, no, that's a carrot.

Speaker 6:          03:25:09       Like constantly believe they pay people to just watch for dicks. They find double entendres where there were no double entendres constantly. Um, imagine the, well we would, we, we would like even, I mean, I don't know how much we should be talking about this, but like on fish hooks, it'd be like we, we would, we would write something and then without even thinking about the, that it has the potential to be some way in which, yeah, they'd always find it and then they would take the thing and they would be like, oh, like they dig up this lane, it's like, it's fine. Like definition 12 on urban dictionary and they'd be like, that's a, that's an offensive phrase ever heard of before. It would be like this Rube Goldberg machine of like how it's offensive or how it could be perceived as a Dick Bush, you know what I mean?

Speaker 6:          03:25:54       A lack of a better, it was, it was pretty well, but I will say great place to work. Uh, a wonderful company. Oh yeah. I mean just don't tweet jokes and years ago the company was tweet jokes. 10 years ago, whatever you do, don't get in a time machine. Not to be a show 10 years ago, period. Not do it. Like they were Rad. It was mainly just the standards department. They were just like gigantic tools and that every firm from day to day, week to week, they would constantly change. I remember one time we had like, there was like, there's like some scene where it was like, oh, we're going underground and there's some trolls. Um, there's some like dwarves, there's some ogres or whatever and they're like, oh, you cannot, you cannot have dwarves anymore. That team, that term is kind of offensive and update and we would never allow, we would never allow a dwarf to be in a Disney production.

Speaker 6:          03:26:38       And literally as they were saying that, I was looking out my window looking at the giant stone, seven dwarves holding up the roof of the Disney filling and I was like these guys are so I've completely gone off the fucking reservation. They reboot the seven dwarves. It was like a newer, they call it the seven d maybe they can't say the word door, I'm not sure. And maybe they're right, but it was just like the hypocrisy of like you guys just the roof is literally being held up by giant stone one you're playing like a, like a like a world of warcraft and you and your role at dwarf characters and that, I mean yeah I'm not up or like I'm not an expert medical term. I guess maybe it, it is medical term and now like, but it wouldn't be one thing if they were like, I have a few door friends and that's what they prefer to be called. Like war ride it cause I've paid. They don't like what did you say it in the mic? Furries rule from I believe C K N c. A n. C a way to go. I'm going to talk on Ethan's fancy mic wait ago. Hey, got, what else? We got 56,000 how are you feeling about the next round? Yeah,

Speaker 3:          03:27:42       I just want to get it over with. And your dog keeps licking my feet. Oh, I paid for one, but all right. Hooks ready up?

Speaker 4:          03:27:52       How many, how many people on the donation check? It's just throwing a dollar. You know, it's not that much to just answer this question. How many people have paid to either write on joey or Ethan's face or for a song by Aussie and it's just kind of never happened?

Speaker 3:          03:28:14       That's a great question. Yes.

Speaker 4:          03:28:15       Oh yeah. I feel really bad that I'm, we're, we're working through them right now. Oh, okay. Okay. Okay. Sorry, I just, I just, I don't know if it's tilted by or, or,

Speaker 3:          03:28:26       um, that was from, we've got tube charts. Dot Net [inaudible] dot net, which is from tube charts.net. Oh Wow. What is tube charts and styles go to two charts down that it's not like I'm a little afraid to go check. And then we've got at s squared is from I from Ihg. I guess big money is getting involved here. Um, uh, Moses, can you come hook shredding up with some food or treats or something? You should read it on the front. It's not again, you can start over. Yeah, I've been asked to draw something in Justin's style. Justin, don't be offended if I fuck it up. Oh, nobody's watching the feed. You ask them a really important question and now nobody's watching and they just donated more money. I can't watch if people had donated in vain.

Speaker 3:          03:29:24       Oh my God. Not My mouth. Mitchell stashed there. What did you, uh, right. Okay. Thank you. In my mouth as well. Straight. Go get joey. You're up next. You look like kind of crushed joey. Your stomach. All right. And you can't eat pizza cause you're on a diet. Now tell me, uh, can you, uh, give joey the Michaela now tell me about your diet, if you would a why are you dieting? Um, I was training for the fight. Yes. So that's why I'm just kidding. Binom I'm doing not well no, that's a fair point. We were going to have this battle meme royale and it was supposed to happen, but um, we had a production company looking at and they just straight up ghosted us, which is strange. When I was trying to train, I was doing the Quito cause I want her to look ripped and uh, I mean I'm back on it now. Hopefully the fight eventually happens, but like I, I've been, I was training hard every morning for a while and then I slowly stopped. You stopped just because I didn't know what was happening. It's too much work now. Are you, are you interested in fitness? You're trying to get jack to, um, read what this says. So we just got furries rule

Speaker 8:          03:30:40       once more and we also got race. Oh Wow. You have it. Not True. That was no. Oh, there's no a race. Baiter hey man, that's great. Congratulations. What else is left? Thank you for your donation bag.

Speaker 24:         03:31:00       Topic topic.

Speaker 8:          03:31:03       Thank you Mitchell. Now Joey, are you, you were had a significant other last I saw you. Is that still going on? Not, not that one new one. Oh No. On what happened with the last one? Seemed like you guys were hitting it off. I don't remember. We broke up like a year ago. Where were you guys living together? It seemed real serious. No, she was just over every day. And so the new one, tell me about her. This new one or do you guys making like a facebook page that you guys had a hope that prank channels? Facebook doesn't, let me change the name of the page. It's ready. It's done. You're done. All right. And what was the new one? The new one. Her name's actually Gila or what's the new? A little sharpie subscribed to lab coat and toppy the topic. Can you say that into the mic once more subscribed, a lab coat and toppy the topic. Thank you guys.

Speaker 18:         03:31:53       Hey, I mean it's moving slowly. We're going to be here all fricking night. Bus 57,000.

Speaker 8:          03:31:59       So wait, listen to this. The new ground scene, she's half black, half Jewish. So I'm very exotic. They can't call me a racist Nazi no more. Is that why you were with her? Yup. Covered everything. I don't care at all about her. I just need a date or for like a week. How long have you guys been together? A couple of months. Yep. And does she sympathize with your political beliefs? Yeah, I'm red. Pilling are a little bit, hmm. Is it red is red pilling um, do you find it strange that this whole movement is based around a matrix metaphor? I think that's kind of cool. It's a little Corny, isn't it? But it's an easy way to like put it know. And do you think that being enlightened red pill is, is like as if Morpheus, we're giving you the option to blue or red? I don't think it's that serious. It's not that serious. Okay.

Speaker 24:         03:32:51       Okay.

Speaker 8:          03:32:52       Do, what's the difference between woken red pilled? I think they're the exact opposite. Right? It's like, depends on what side you're on. That's what woke means, you know what I mean? So it's like, oh, you can be woke. But it's like you can also be on the left or you going to be woke and you can be on the right. It depends on what you're woke to. So red building woke, does it mean the same thing? It depends what side you're on.

Speaker 18:         03:33:14       I've attempted to draw, do a drawing and Justin royal and style way as close as I can to something that might look like adjusting oil and drawing. Oh, let's see. Let me hold. Let me hold it here. And I ain't got the fake, uh, saying, Hey folks, I'm Mister Malora. So I'm an original character. I'm scared of dying. That's my gimmick. That's my thing. I'm really scared. We should all be scared. And this mouth is saying number three, bro. I'm less scared letting up, bro. Do. We've got a new official,

Speaker 7:          03:33:38       just character. Alex. Don't, don't let Justin know. Alex, it looks pretty plausible. Think I'm going to do a second careers. Maybe it's close as I could remember it. Uh, what he's, what his signature looks like. I know there's curling reuland original by Alex now he needs to do it. Alex was original by Justin Roiling. I'd be curious to see. I'd be curious to see what it would look like. I'm hoping they make mark that somebody can take straight out. He's getting a little restless now. There's more pizza. There should be a lot more pizza. It's a fuels. My drawings ma'am. So we're at 57,000 guys, let me tell y'all this. This day is getting long. I mean, here's $57,000 there's a lot of money we shouldn't, we shouldn't be a, you know, this isn't chop liver here needs 75 are, we're all stuck here. That's true you guys.

Speaker 7:          03:34:29       We are physically a contractually. We're unable to leave until this guy pukes ups and peppers unfortunately puke and shit. And I mean those are the, how long does this stream lesson four never would get to a hundred there is no end because we can be here for 24 hours. If it takes that long to get 75 I'll be right back. I think we'd all be happy ending on 75. I think that 75 is good, but we can do is if we get 100,000 off stream, maybe we can just, we'll get a widget thousand offers room for sure, but I'll, I'll eat the reaper for like another broadcast or something real there. That's pretty amazing because I forget what we're doing. A recap on Friday. Hey are we live? And I think we'll hit it before then. Hey, I could take one of them back with me to New York and then I could just do it though.

Speaker 7:          03:35:15       That's awesome. Can you maybe save this for, uh, you know when we're done you guys, uh, your defeatist fucking like I'll do, I'll figure out how to do it then we'll share defeat. It's happening tonight. All right. Everyone share it on their twitter right now. Just, just share the everyone. Okay. Did you see Alex's, uh, Justin? Somebody has adjust and reuland style drawing. This looks great. Oh my God, this is so consistent advice. Very close to what I would actually draw. Now, do you have notes? What would you have done differently? How do I make this more like a justin royal and drawing? What are like the telltale giveaways for like an art curator? Wow. No, I mean you really, this is a, this is pretty dead on. Justin is kinda shocked here. I think a, I think it might be out of business. What about, what about the signature?

Speaker 7:          03:36:04       What are the telltale mistakes in the signature? The signature is a shit show, but everything else is like they, the handwriting and signature of the or the or the, that character is like, like if, if like if I put that in a drawer and like a few years later I would not even, I wouldn't just assume I drew it. That's pretty amazing. Are you going to draw a, you going to draw an Alex Harris drawing now? Are you going to try to talk the world? I'm not the chameleon of artists. You know, just like I'm not the chameleon of voice actors. Should we go over the reward impressionism

Speaker 8:          03:36:37       impression? Do we need to tell these people what's at stake here guys? We really are trying to help $500 people. Oh no sir. A hundred bucks. That's all it cost to draw to deface Joey's face, 500 to face my face. Those were not, those were down for a while, right? Or or what? I mean it's up now. We figured out what it was actually. So we originally thought we were only going to six and we didn't want those to go after and so they had expired and so I just, I just reinitiated them and I said it to eight, but if we get close to eight and we're still going, oh you got to keep going and half hours we got, we got, we got to go to at least seven hours. I mean we did five hours last year, so we still have an hour and a half, but we definitely get to thousand.

Speaker 8:          03:37:25       We're not that close to 75 though. No, we got to hit, we got to hit a Christmas miracle. You know what it was, you know what it was? It was my fault for building that fucking toy in the beginning. I wasn't contributing. I wasn't like given the given the show the energy not too late Bro. For game changing. Prank call. That's all I'm saying. Who can we prank? No, so the law is as long as we call someone outside of California, it was also recording. Some states have a one party consent call enzymes, which up out I was like, well we can call it enzyme. We can call like scammers. I mean let's call it, let's do some print color. Let's call it scammer. Like cash for gold people or a role. This is legitimate company. No, but if you go on Google and type like type something like how to send money to my grandchild and click one of the ads.

Speaker 8:          03:38:20       Oh it was like a straight up scammer. Yeah. I don't know if we'll do it as good as like some of these other ones like, well why don't you guys recommend some people that we don't have to feel guilty about Pradco. Are there any, are there any guilt free frank calls? If you could give us some suggestions from the donation spot cause we would love to, frank calls him the dollars. I'm like no. Karma. Karma points docked on us. Yeah, we got a call from the president of the, yeah. What's going on with that, Dan? Where's the park? We president. I heard we were going to, and we'll get a call from Donald Trump. Me Check my text messages. Just cause I'm in tight with the, I'm going to fight with the president. Let me ask you a bunch of questions for the president. Donald, are you ready? Yeah, hold on. Will you let me sort of like talk to the president when he's on? Yeah. Yes, absolutely. I mean, that's why we're doing this. I thought, I specifically thought that you would have a lot to, a lot of questions for the president that I think are like, you know, important and I would love just an opportunity of like an uninterrupted little moment for me to ask some of those questions. Can I use that? Oh, for fuck sake.

Speaker 8:          03:39:31       But don't mess with it. No, I, let's watch another video. Come on. I want to prank call post malone. That's not happy. No, no, no.

Suspect is now in custody, no word on his condition or possible.

Then it's like, it's like, look, you learned your lesson. You learned your lesson of a California resident. Oh, reverse sneezing. Yeah. I think he's all right. Nobody can just cover his nose. I don't think he's in a gunny gunny advice about a folks we should a prank call guys. People that were still bellow the key. Joel osteen was such a perfect villain. You know what I mean? Well, at that particular moment in time, yeah, sure. It was like, I mean, I'm sure he's still a piece of any of these filthy. I really like big blue. Really like my whole ended up prayer lines in general. Just because you're playing with fire a little bit though, because you had a lot of those people that, why don't we, why don't we, why don't we call it like one of those paid psychic line scientology? Psychic lines are fantastic.

Speaker 2:          03:47:40       Just got word from the secret service. He is on the phone.

Speaker 7:          03:47:45       Somebody just gave us a one 800 psychics, one 800 I took.com and a number w w. Dot. 1-800-PSYCHIC psychic and a website. We have to call the Hollywood www dot.

Speaker 7:          03:48:22       Such a cartoony middle name. John Simpson Bowles. Jay Moose, right? Michael J. Fox,

Speaker 4:          03:48:28       everybody.

Speaker 19:         03:48:29       Jay. Well that person. Mr President, are you there? Nope.

Speaker 27:         03:48:33       Hello.

Speaker 19:         03:48:34       Oh my God. Oh my goodness. What a honor to be. I think guys were joking. We get some precedent music. Please. Thank you. The music down. He's the president is to quiet music is still out. I can't hear. Interesting. Mr President, is anybody back there? We turn them up. Stop talking over him. Yeah. Well the music is pretty loud.

Speaker 4:          03:49:01       It's an honor to have you here. I, I had a few questions that, uh, I think, you know, the larger populous would, would really like you to answer. And I answered them honestly. Um, what do you, what do you think about that?

Speaker 27:         03:49:18       Oh, that's all right. We'll do it. I think whatever of life that took it, nobody will do it. But go ahead.

Speaker 4:          03:49:24       All right, so, so the first question I have is what do you think of slender man? That whole, that crazy cooky.

Speaker 27:         03:49:33       Oh, you know, there's so many complicated things to do with others, but it's true that this person got to, Alli sent through, we don't talk weight. We tried to throw a fit.

Speaker 19:         03:49:48       That's probably, but first what we will see static and that's that good. So we're looking at today, I've got my cup. I said, yes,

Speaker 4:          03:50:07       Mr President. It's clear you have a strong opinion on a lot to say about slenderman. We didn't, we didn't quite hear most of it, but I, I hope the audience out out there watching the screen and see on Air Force One right now. President, are you on Air Force One or what's going on here?

Speaker 27:         03:50:25       We are totally bobby. All of the countries worldwide initially started. It's total chaos.

Speaker 4:          03:50:32       Hmm. Well, well as it, as interesting as that line of discussion might be, I, I'm, I'm actually more curious to know what do you think of these Weird Nintendo? You know, Nintendo just sent out these little like, you know, original nes game pads that kind of slide into the side of your, your, your switch system. You know what I'm talking about? They just, they just recently sent those out and you had to, in order to get them,

Speaker 27:         03:50:57       well, just what she's doing started with the company as long as you rest, but you're looking at Mario and you look at least gets you out of bed the whole day and it doesn't make any sense. Okay. I little, I look at Barrio, I say, what is he? It doesn't make sense. Why does he want to be a bit? Okay. But they are totally fairly, from what I understand, you see, you get it. It's family and May in the dumpster. Okay. What you should really invest it is new soldier boy cut. So that's what the body is dead. I kill you.

Speaker 4:          03:51:29       Yeah, I have, I've been hearing, I've been hearing good things about the soldier boy console, so that's a really good thing. Um, what, do you know what, yeah, sorry, sorry to interrupt. I know. Uh, what, what do you, what do you think about the, the um, this whole, uh, you know, uh, uh, digital streaming channel that lets you watch nickelodeon

Speaker 27:         03:51:48       depo her and, and they are both really the Boogie board vote people in or what to did you bond? They stripped out Jeff, three, four, five up to five days. So you have a evolution. So that's something we liked but we have to look at Yoga.

Speaker 4:          03:52:05       Mr President, I just have to ask, you know, you brought up, did you mind um, you know, Michael Huckabee is famously come out so that he doesn't believe in, uh, did you, did you, did you evolution, uh, he doesn't believe that. Uh, did your mind can ditch evolve? What is your, what is your take on that Mr President?

Speaker 27:         03:52:20       I think if you put shit people compared to a get you by Roy Taylor then, which I think if I have to be right, it's totally about get be a puppy, be what gives it, did you post right? You get of through the circuits. I said you would be a very different story.

Speaker 4:          03:52:36       Yeah, that's the, that's a pretty, I mean, I can't disagree with that.

Speaker 18:         03:52:39       No. Mr President, as you all know, the power rangers was a very popular show and the 90s now a lot of people say the pink power ranger was, it was the most powerful, but I, but many also say the red power ranger was the most powerful.

Speaker 27:         03:52:57       Yeah. You were looking at the power rangers and the black one was black. I don't know what was going on there, but it was just total dictatorship. I don't really talk about it, but text off. Yay. Go ahead.

Speaker 4:          03:53:11       Um, uh, w what do you think of Japanese candies? I mean, are you, are you familiar with these little monkeys?

Speaker 27:         03:53:17       Sure. You look at Japanese women and they look a little bit younger than the rest of the world. Right. That joke yet. But it's legal and the whole thing is legal and they say the people go there to get a white people go to give hand because of the way every, I show younger than six fit because of like white guys. But that's the case, so. Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:53:37       But Mr President, what do you think about the, the treats, the Japanese treats like the pokey or Paki Hello Panda Panda. You know some of these mushroom shaped a little chocolate. Three avoiding the question. Romney's soda. How do you feel about the light full? Avoiding. Avoiding both.

Speaker 27:         03:53:54       We could just judge you how you see yourself. You people put this fake stuff. Okay. But this is what the truth is. Okay. I'm telling you it is okay. I am totally cool. Why? I love the animation epic. Okay. That's what I love. Okay. I keep telling you people, but they would print it like you beside your [inaudible]. So I've sat though, I love Japanese culture. I love the pictures. Right? The contracts that was present. Mr Braden, as I have super powers. Ed, I see pizza. I say it's crazy. Okay.

Speaker 2:          03:54:27       Now Mister President, do you consume a Hentai? What do you think that Hentai it should be illegal. I know a lot of Hentai depicts very young girls in it and a lot of people find that question. What do you, what do you think about this type of Hentai that depicts very young girls? Mr President.

Speaker 27:         03:54:46       Well, I was sitting there and I never heard of this. I said, how did it all by people? What am I tap? People came up to me and it shouldn't be surprised. What did you think of head size has ever heard of it? So they gave me a laptop with that guy. He said the elders and they left me alone for third one out. But you're looking at these pictures and they're horrible. And his knees. I look, girls look so young, but they like it. It's sort of like, but that's okay. We can talk about that because they are like it. But you look at these authentic, those fucking Webinar. So weak Leo Speedo say this. That's okay.

Speaker 4:          03:55:22       Um, do you, uh, what was a really thought provoking answer? Yeah, that was going to answer like, well, what do you think? What do you think of these? Uh, what do you think of these? Like these, these scooters, lyme or bird, all these companies, these scooters and, and, and, and what do you think about segway, the segway pro.

Speaker 27:         03:55:40       Wait, hold on. Okay. Okay. I'm sorry. You took video. 2 billion views. Thinking there's 2 billion people. That's a lot of people. That's a lot of people killed, but it has 2 million views. I sorted edit with a little boy, a little Mexican boy. I, we showed one of these scooters. I said, what is that? But the little boy, he falls off the scooter in the video. Okay. Yes. Uh Huh. Go ahead.

Speaker 4:          03:56:15       Okay. Are you, is that the, so you're, is that Mr President, are you there? Are you, is that you saying? Yeah.

Speaker 27:         03:56:21       Oh, I really, yes. That was a little boy fell off the stool and that's it.

Speaker 4:          03:56:24       Okay. So, so, okay, got it. You're against them. Um, I'm, I'm kind of curious, Mr President, who do you mean? Maybe he's for them. I, yeah, not quite clearly dodging the Co. I think the president wants to move on

Speaker 27:         03:56:41       the little boy, the [inaudible] the four simple than I am. Maybe you take things typically, I just know, pick up, look at the little boy. And once you see that video you'll just stared. Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:56:54       Mr President, what, what's your take on Mario paint? The classic Mario Paint for Nintendo Super Nintendo. Do you think it should be remade? Do you think there should be a modern, more, more featured, uh, uh, more features, more fleshed out version of Mario paint?

Speaker 27:         03:57:09       Hmm. Barrio be released for the switch 2019 and then there was easily 20. Thank you Lord. Okay. That's, is that a basis?

Speaker 4:          03:57:18       Yeah. Yeah. Can I ask who do you mean and smash? Mr Who? Who, who do you mean when you play smash brothers against other world leaders? Yeah.

Speaker 27:         03:57:25       Where are you looking at? You're looking at what you gave is right there. There's all these killings doesn't sell, but that's just, okay. But I saw somebody playing the scale by playing the game. They should be on. What is that? He said, dad, don't look. I said, what is that edge? I realized that Super Smash Brothers was epic. I looked at word right. If you've heard of this,

Speaker 2:          03:57:50       we have heard of the word man.

Speaker 27:         03:57:53       It gets fucking sweet. Lowest, every religious great, right? This is what we'd like to talk about. But, so I saw his very far. They shared my thoughts with this. I don't get it. There's all these gay, they're fighting. That's what's, what's with the fighting

Speaker 4:          03:58:07       you're, you're saying you'd like to see a, a more peaceful, uh, a version of

Speaker 27:         03:58:12       Oh, smash brothers. The situation with all the kids so that we will get into that. But you're looking at bowery [inaudible] Gel dot. Okay. And it's so great. It's so cool.

Speaker 2:          03:58:27       Now, Mr President, what is a, what is done? What do you think about? So when you think of the game, Zelda, the, the main protagonist, the hero of that game is link actually. But a lot of people think that it's Zelda because the name is Zola, but that's the name of the princess. Now, do you think that this name, that this game should be called the adventures of link? Do you find that that the way that it's branded is inappropriate?

Speaker 27:         03:58:52       I talked to get totally this lady. I say it should be happy. Look to do, we will be putting my copy both. I would like to look at the public. Not People. You want to do it? Your president. Okay.

Speaker 4:          03:59:05       Uh, yeah. Um, so what do you think of Bitcoins, Mr President? Are you a big fit coin guy? He are. You, you buy a couple of bitcoins or what

Speaker 27:         03:59:18       though? They per se do the Bitcoin, they were second best. The best of best did I looked at doing it. It looks like a total fraud. Just see what the stem, I think anybody about bitcoin before the crash is stupid. That's okay. We won't get it today. But what I did was I invested heavily in goats going judge. Cause I could write babe of course thing.

Speaker 2:          03:59:40       Now Mr President, if I can ask you something a little more personal, uh, do you, how do you wipe the Ed when you have a debt, when you defecate in the bathroom, do you end with a wet one? Do you use baby wipes? Do you have a, um, do they, how do you clean up the feces around your, your asshole, Mr President after that

Speaker 27:         04:00:00       covered look at us and off the both feeling a certain way, right? A very good day. I do that pretty much a bad day. I just feel bad. I should wear where you have two people come in and do it themselves. But there's a lot of ways to do it right. It's that great, but there's a lot of ways. That's right.

Speaker 2:          04:00:15       Well, Mr President, I have to say it's been very eye opening. Uh, you've dodged some questions,

Speaker 8:          04:00:20       but for the most part you've been very forthcoming.

Speaker 27:         04:00:24       Yes. I love all of you people. I think you're all great in sales. I don't be, you keep video, get it shoved communities. My favorite one of all, I love this. It's great.

Speaker 18:         04:08:28       I was trying to like get one in like every time I would try it with like another, it would be a slot would be taken and then I'd try again. That was a fan named Spencer that requested that. Tell me, I see you were backstage at rehearsing. How was your preparation for that?

Speaker 29:         04:08:47       Um, it was, it was interesting up. Do I need to talk in this mic?

Speaker 18:         04:08:51       You don't want to hear Mike's now that. Oh, okay. Oh, okay. Yeah. Okay.

Speaker 29:         04:08:56       Um, all right. Um, it was interesting. I was like sitting out in front of the bathroom and there was a guy, actually, he was kind of interesting with the context of the song, but there was a guy walking around with the flashlight for some reason just like shoot, like shining a flashlight is puffin and creeping. And he was explaining on me,

Speaker 7:          04:09:14       I don't know, is that normal around the building? Oh, that definitely, that happened the whole time. And I was like, you're a while you're playing. People think so. I think what it was like for him, mommy, Justin dresses up as a security guard and walks around with a flashlight. It was not me guys. You guys would know that there's going to be some like really rational reason why that was happening. Building. But he died and he was like, we called them flashlight, flashlight on. You did, he was already doing it. He was doing it before I got there. And then and then kind of like continue to know why I should have just chose a different location. I am. I sat like right next to him. You can, you can do them right in this room. So it seems like you probably want to be, you can just do it.

Speaker 7:          04:10:08       Any song. Right? If you, if you have a moment, one of hers, he's just not like sheet music for peep and creep is available on line listening to it.

There's like, there's like, I'm not shitting around guys. I know that varies. That's a famous spray familiar with, there's like maybe a hundred of these total made. Um, so you know, if you're looking at, if you're looking to, if you're looking for bitcoin style investments, well, and then if, I dunno if you want to pitch this a little, but this, this is worth 100,000, I think.

Speaker 7:          04:18:00       But it is like, it's literally priceless because there aren't any, there aren't any more of that. Yeah. There's no way. There's, there's nothing one of the

Speaker 10:         04:18:08       Bible, but it's also one of a kind because it's, it's, it's the first one ever. It's the test print with mistakes that you like. There's some like there's some, I think there's some typos in there. There's some slight differences between the final version dude guys. Oh, also by the way, you should, you should in the front cover of that. You should write down like all of that information's in the bush. Sure. Yeah, because that will really fucking like authentic, authentic, utilize it and if the winter wants it signed, I'll sign it. If they don't want it signed, I won't sign it, but I'll find go back.

It was pretty well at that. Shout out to the grandma's virginity podcast. Justin. Ah, you've got an old school dry Yang. Oh eat. Oh Ethan, you asshole. He should have left that dude up there as the top donor. I'm telling you he's, he stole it man. Well that means that means one of us. Oh No, no, no, no. That means the fans have to outdo you ethan. Like fucking knock him off. And I was like someone looking for knock him off his little pedestal not to donate. All right, I'm getting drawn on me. Uh, I don't know if, uh, I think that was Ethan's brainchild. Ethan's got to decide what exists on your face. It's up to him, man. Your face. This is property, unfortunately. Yeah. They, uh, uh, people in the, uh, everyone donating. Any suggestions for what I should do for my next, uh, drawing dropping on me. Let me know. $1. Just $1 to believe a comment.

But um, it was, it has to be requested by the audience. All right. And you got to see what they're going to ask for. I just want a sweater. I'm sorry. Sad bear. I can't give you a sweater, but I was, I was having a hard time donating. I was just trying to donate right now. It's just so hard. I should like, I shouldn't be like pointing my phone towards the camera. Entering my credit card number. [inaudible] Santa Joey, we got, we got was popping. You know,

Speaker 14:         04:25:49       we've got the dyngus

Speaker 6:          04:25:50       love you guys. Hey, every single person. Look, I know there's been a little bit of negativity, a little bit of like, why don't you guys fucking donate more? But Hey, like literally every single person who donated a dollar is like bureau. Like every single dollar is going straight to a good cause. All of you guys would feel amazing hours ago. I'm almost 64 grand. That's a lot of the money. That's like a nice car. Somebody keeps saying draw. Ethan has post Malone, but it's like all we have to do is keep drawing on his face and he's like [inaudible] he's getting there. He's getting closer. Just write like always tired. Right? Isn't that it on the, on the eyelids. Keep it up. Proud of you. Thank you. Michelle Obama always tired too. Fuck. That's relatable, right? Lots of thick boys in this dream. Wowza. I don't know if that was, I don't know if I can take that. Yeah, that's probably me. I feel like I want to take the compliment, but I don't think I'm thinking of for that. Do you guys want to see me light myself on fire for the next okay, here. $1 donations. Yes. $2 for no. I know I kind of took the prime real estate but you will, you will. You just, right. You want me to be some there Paul Paul Rodriguez, the skateboarder wrote it. This is like, this is like and then and then and then when you just,

Speaker 7:          04:27:02       just, just like somewhere in like the cold war in like Zig Zag. The foil. Yeah, the core foil. I want to get Ethan to sign it. Like everyone should sign it once, once and then I, then I'm going to fucking, I'm going to like, I'm going to literally build that. That will be a full complete deck. If I sign it you'll get devalued. So yeah, Joe, you're not allowed to sign it. Draw some cool shit. This is a pretty great prize. I think it is cause it's amazing. We're all going to draw on this deck and then I'm going to actually, I'm going to, I'm going to set this deck up. The Wa like as like a deck that I would ride. Like this was sort of my, you know, preference. Justin, would you describe yourself risers? Oh by the way, keep in mind you're drawing, right? Well pads are going to be speaking out the corner so like yeah, he's peeking out of the corner so, but I'll put the signature over there.

Speaker 7:          04:27:46       Yeah, like keep drawing but go and draw mabel like like right, right here. Probably just going to frame it as it is. I don't think they gonna ride. No, but it's going to come to them complete with, oh, I'm going to build it. I'm going to, I'm going to build it all at school full. But they could take the trucks off and then frame it if that's what they want with the trucks were actually true. We could, here we go. I'm putting some big fat fucking a 70 millimeter wheels on it and then eat and this and this. Amazing as the thing. Which side do you frame?

Speaker 7:          04:28:19       What company is is? Oh enjoy. This is some good grip tape. This is fucking great. Better than just plain old. Like flat, flat black. Yeah. The Joan donations of slowed down. I feel like we got to think of like a, Hey, donate in the goddamn money. Think of like a sub one for a 65 until we fucking just just burn the midnight oil. Just get some coffee man. It's Tuesday. Well what could we do to get more people to your friends? Tweet it to your very famous friends to have like millions of followers just to save way more famous friends and you do but he's not going to bug them. So you got a bug. Your own famous friends grabbed some famous friends for sure. I have been sort of pinging be nudging, pinging and nudging and then they like, it's a gentle and then they like pop into the feed and just see it's like eating pizza and like dropping a pencil on the ground. Let's go. Let's do it. This is commitment man. Sorry Ethan. Will you do the graver phone call now? Will you just sign right over here? Keep in mind there's going to be, there's going to be a riser pad right here. Right here. So like right in this neighborhood and I want Elo to sign somewhere like along along the side here for credit card. Put it in. This is a tax write off because we were doing a benefit for a church or a church. Whatever weird stuff you see we're doing a charity event. What have, see by the way, I'm

Speaker 10:         04:30:08       sore throat, not feeling good and by the way, gargle some salt water and did it work? Did it help a little bit? Yeah.

Speaker 8:          04:30:17       Helps that. You hear that ladies and gentlemen, Garbo that salt. We'll have my signature. That's how I sign everything. You asshole. I actually like it. That's great. Okay, so you look right here. Okay. Just anything you want. Maybe even draw something cool. Okay. You can do it. Portrait or landscape, whatever you want it. It's crazy that the president called in earlier.

Speaker 10:         04:30:42       Yeah. Oh my God. I'm still like tripping out. You know, none of us expected. I'm glad we hit, you know, I'd love to have him call back in, but after I kind of think about

Speaker 8:          04:30:50       a few more things I'd like to ask, right? Yeah. We kind of, we missed some opportunities. Crayola crayon color names. That'd be a good one, right?

Speaker 10:         04:31:01       Yeah. I want to know what he thinks about like polly pocket and mighty Max. That whole war from the eighties you know, which one's better? What's his opinion on these, uh, on these new rereleases of, yeah,

Speaker 8:          04:31:09       the Shama Gotchas. It's like, you know, why don't, why do Japanese people get all the cool Tamma got cheese? You know, I really do want to ask such a good question. Does he think that Amiibos gives an unfair balanced, I mean, what's he going to do to prevent the rise of ai in the form of Amoebas? Amoebas is not fair. Like Amoeba is. Ain't ain't fair there too expansive. All right. Where are we literally gave some psychic hotline. Oh my God. It says top donor $2,000 shredder. Give me one more minute. I'm getting us set up an account with them. I don't see that to me. Why do I see that? You got to refresh. Maybe. Maybe it's in your need to refresh and there it is. There we go. Nope. Draw Jesus eating.

Speaker 10:         04:32:02       Oh wait, wait, wait. Who is that red or is someone that someone here, Lex Machina. The higher that gets, the more unlikely it's going to be that it'll, it'll be from like a real fan. Most of that 75 just see that joey salads eat that yummy little mugs. Gummy.

Speaker 8:          04:32:30       All right. We're going to call it an where we got to get to that 75 you guys eat do it for Ila for Christ's sake. She's sick. She, she's pregnant. Yeah, she her.

I don't know if it's going to happen. Maybe we tell they get the call if we get to 70 what is you been on with? Shredder. Oh, that was you toes literally having such a hard time like getting all the pieces to work that I just dropped it. I just drop it in the hard. You were having a hard time bidding on something. Are you decided? I just kept, every time I kept selecting it kept like popping off.

Speaker 8:          04:33:14       So tell [inaudible] was fucking you. I mean, I'm also an idiot, so it might've been my, you're not that dog ready? You getting into anything? Where are you being a cutie pie? All right Dan, how are we doing on the psychic draw? A T rex surfing on a chainsaw. Happies them 70,000 we call the psychic. Yeah. If we get to 70,000 just in really wants to prank calling a psychic and maybe maybe it'll turn out the psychic has like our future and like maybe we'll actually learn something like this in reuland. We're Joe not humanity hangs in the balance. Oh, Zach says he's on the phone right now. I get it. Less plus. Okay. Wow. This is really fascinating stuff. I didn't know you were into skateboarding. Justin. What? I didn't know you were into skateboarding. I just realize I need a fucking like a box cutter style blade. Do you skateboard, Justin? Really? I'm not fucking out there and do. Well you can create, you can like, you can roll your role. When you were younger did you skateboard like as its mode of transportation? No kidding.

Speaker 8:          04:34:30       That's really pleasant. I'm sure all the podcasts, this nerves, y'all put my mind towards that. The only thing tops that is me chewing into the mic. Well, I'm excited about this. Uh, uh, people are saying isla go home girl. Well we wish it was possible. We're getting close to 67,000 yet cock suckers. Anyone have a fucking, I forgot to bring my little razor blade. Like there's probably not a box cutter. I can just take the blade out and just going to shit. I already got the grip tape on, but how does it stay on there? Did you glue it or something? It doesn't load sticker. Oh sticker. And so you can see, wow, that's a CIC board. Yeah, that looks pretty awesome. This grip tape and then the signature and once I get the trucks and yeah, I think, I think this will be this, this one's good. That's a nice option. And I think that's a nice build. Would you say it's a pretty nice, I'll call that a build, right? While we wait for that, for that little razor blade. Let's see what other fucking stuck in my Dan and Sarah, whoever's out there. If you have a razor blade, help help a brother out. I haven't got a video.

Speaker 31:         04:48:05       Okay, let me,

Speaker 10:         04:48:07       I'm good. I just had a couple of questions. Question number one, thinking of opening to chucky cheese franchise and I am just, it's causing me a bunch of grief. By the way. I just want to let you know that I'm recording this just for my own purse, for my own playback. I'm not even going to say personal, but just from my own playback. So this is important. It's important because you know this isn't, this isn't a pennies we're talking about. This is, you know, this is, this is the real mccoy. So I can listen. We can so we can all listen to this back later and really get it all figured out. So I'm trying to, I'm thinking about open and um, um, e cheese. Uh, but really bringing it back to the old school, like awesome. Animatronic, that style, you know, chuck e cheese, you know, variety hour, like the rock fire explosion style, you know, the, the kids get called in. Yeah,

Speaker 31:         04:49:05       I know exactly what you're talking about.

Speaker 10:         04:49:07       So I'm thinking about doing that and I have a little bit of money. I'm going to get some loans and some investments from friends and family and I'm doing this in Bakersfield. So, you know, I'm thinking, I'm thinking it'll work. I'm thinking it's going to work and I just wanted to call and see what your opinions are. Do you think that this will fly? Do you think that this will really, this, is this going to put the wind in my financial sales?

Speaker 31:         04:49:33       Okay. What I'm going to do is wrong with this. I'm going to go straight to the cards. I'm going to do a three card pull. Let's see what we get.

Speaker 10:         04:49:41       Three Card Monte as they call it. In my lap. I gambled, gambled all my money away last year. So that's, that's why I said that.

Speaker 31:         04:49:52       Okay. Let's see what we get first cards and,

Speaker 10:         04:49:55       and by the way, you might, this could be an evaluation call, this could be an evaluation call. So just letting, you know, don't, don't mess it up.

Speaker 31:         04:50:05       Are driving a brand salary like a negative nancy, but we're talking money in here and,

Speaker 10:         04:50:13       but we're also talking dreams.

Speaker 31:         04:50:15       Whoa. Um, I've got the through with tenable's direct pedicles are known as the points

Speaker 10:         04:50:23       is fine. So the Druid pinnacle direct, is that what you said?

Speaker 11:         04:50:29       Okay.

Speaker 31:         04:50:29       I've tentacles direct.

Speaker 10:         04:50:32       I using the grandmom yet from the deck, the Grumman Deck. I'm just trying to like, you're a bit, it's a bit hard to hear, but I'm, I think I'm following you.

Speaker 31:         04:50:42       I know. I think you've got me on speaker phone, which is making a very fuzzy on my end also.

Speaker 10:         04:50:50       Hold on. Okay.

Speaker 31:         04:50:51       Can you hear me?

Speaker 10:         04:50:51       Yeah, yeah, I can. Okay. Is that better?

Speaker 31:         04:50:56       Okay. That's a little better.

Speaker 10:         04:50:57       Okay.

Speaker 31:         04:51:00       Okay. Go ahead.

Speaker 10:         04:51:04       Panicles

Speaker 31:         04:51:08       right. When you look directly at finances, my concern is the level, um, it's reading low.

Speaker 10:         04:51:15       Oh, you like my finances are reading low.

Speaker 31:         04:51:19       Okay. We're reading directly on the thought process of starting this business, doing the chuck e cheese investing. Okay.

Speaker 10:         04:51:31       Chuck e cheese. Are you saying I don't have enough coins to do it?

Speaker 31:         04:51:43       Yeah.

Speaker 10:         04:51:47       Big, big, big money, right? Oh, oh well that's quite an upset.

Speaker 31:         04:51:56       Yeah,

Speaker 10:         04:51:58       I mean, you know, you, you know I, I'm a big firm believer of of the chucky cheese original model. I'm like, you know, we might be living in a different time, but I think where they went wrong was when they started taking out the cool animatronics and then they started taking out all the fun, weird, creepy rooms with the flashing strobe lights and all that kind of stuff. As soon as they got rid of that stuff. Yeah, you're with me there. Well at least we have some common ground to build this. Okay, well see, you know what I'm talking about. So I'm ready to bring that back to Bakersfield with a punch to the city, right in the throat of the city. I'm going to bring this thing back and I'm going to, and I think that, so you're saying, so the first card is the card of coins, which could be good or bad, right?

Speaker 31:         04:52:54       Tentacles

Speaker 10:         04:52:55       the three of pentacles

Speaker 31:         04:52:58       when you read directly.

Speaker 10:         04:53:01       Okay. And so, and three is that 3 million? Is that 300 is it 3000 how many levels? Like a hundred levels or 10 levels.

Speaker 31:         04:53:14       All right.

Speaker 10:         04:53:17       Oh, okay. So

Speaker 31:         04:53:19       I'm at a three

Speaker 10:         04:53:20       so you know, I mean, you know, you look at it from a bitcoin perspective, it's like, well, if I had, if I had bought $300 a bitcoin in 2009 or 2008 or if I bought $100 a bitcoin in 2008 so it was three versus 10 or sorry. You know what I mean? So it's not so bad. Always a glass half full type. I'm always a glass half full type. Go ahead. The next car is upon. My other concern is the progress. Well know my, I hired my uncle and my cousin Dave, they're out of work. They need a job. That's part of the reason why I'm doing this, uh, to dress up as the mascots and to help me oversee business and accounting and financing and all that stuff. So I'm pretty confident on that front. What, what is, what's the, what's the next card you got

Speaker 31:         04:54:12       the middle car represent the movement. I'm a mover and a shaker. Well, it's incorporated with the numerology of the five. It represents change.

Speaker 10:         04:54:27       You said something about a crawl space, like number one.

Speaker 31:         04:54:31       Oh, sorry. No

Speaker 10:         04:54:34       number one is the side of the mover and a shaker and it's a crawl space kind of scenario where it's like you're going to have to crawl to get to your dream. I never said that. And let me tell you something. I have crawl, I cry. I crawled 12,000 feet. I think it was our 12 12,000 feet out of a tunnel just to escape from a situation. I'm not going to get into it.

Speaker 31:         04:54:59       Good. All right. Can you hear me? Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry. I can hear you. So you think about a crawl space.

Speaker 10:         04:55:05       Oh, okay. Sorry about. Okay. So I must have misheard that. Okay. So you said? Yeah.

Speaker 31:         04:55:12       Wow. I was explaining, go ahead. Oh, I was at, I was explaining the numerology. Oh, I'm looking at the flow of a business. How is it going to flow?

Speaker 10:         04:55:28       I mean, it flows, you know what I mean? It's just like with all the, the, just the relaxation and just [inaudible]. You go with the flow and you put all your heart and soul and effort and energy

Speaker 31:         04:55:39       and you're not, you're not understanding. Oh, but what I'm trying to, I'm looking at it.

Speaker 10:         04:55:45       Are you thinking of it like a psychedelic kind of a way? Like, um, like, uh,

Speaker 32:         04:55:50       okay.

Speaker 31:         04:55:52       No, no. Okay. I'm okay. I'm doing a business reading.

Speaker 10:         04:56:00       Okay. Yes, please.

Speaker 31:         04:56:02       Okay. Hello. Hello. This is ever going to be consistent. Okay. There's, there's always going to be okay

Speaker 10:         04:56:13       downs and I'm ready for that big up.

Speaker 31:         04:56:16       Okay.

Speaker 10:         04:56:16       When we opened the doors that were rolling in it, buying our maseratis and all that stuff.

Speaker 31:         04:56:24       Okay. Okay. This is where I've got to do this. I'm not going to give you false hope on this. My advice to you would be they spend at least the next six months doing some major research possibly.

Speaker 10:         04:56:40       Oh Man. Are you kidding me?

Speaker 31:         04:56:43       Demographic.

Speaker 10:         04:56:43       I'm going to cut you off right there because I, the last year, last 12 months I've been doing major research. I watched a bunch of rocket fire explosion videos on youtube. I went to a bunch of chuck e cheeses. I talked to the employees, talk to some of the children there. I watch. I watch that one video. Have you seen that video of the little kid?

Speaker 31:         04:57:04       I can't help you.

Speaker 10:         04:57:08       No, you're helping me. This is incredible. You are giving me, you're giving me the fire. I need to go achieve this situation because we got a lease on the building.

Speaker 31:         04:57:19       I'm not going to give you false hope when it comes to putting out a lot of money,

Speaker 10:         04:57:23       but you know what though? False hope. A hope floats hope.

Speaker 31:         04:57:31       Okay, tonight I'm ending the call. I'm not going to give you false hope and I don't want you to waste your money.

Speaker 10:         04:57:37       What about Bob Hope? Would you give me a little Bob Hope? Let me just hear it. Everyone can do a good bob hope.

Speaker 17:         04:57:45       Okay.

Speaker 10:         04:57:47       $5 an hour. You're going to turn that down. $5 a minute. I think we lost her. Yo. I have to say I'm depressed that she was pretty honest later just to give you good advice, but like I said, like it sounds like you're the connection wise with money were no longer being, oh, so she ended the call. Maybe I noticed it in a way too still. She was taking advantage of a man who had gone bankrupt who crawled through it now for some reason, just think his life savings into it. Chuck e cheese. He was a decent lady. Oh by the way, no offense to chuck e cheese, although I do think you've got to bring back those animatronics was in the ball pit. Do you know what can we each do one of those? Oh man, this, yeah, please. Versus wait two hours to you. I'll do one by the way, by the way, how much, what was the total on that call?

Speaker 10:         04:58:33       How long? How long? What did that cost delight? So the introductory rate is a dollar as president and we can't, we can't hear Dan. Hold on. There you go. And so the introductory rate is a a a dollar a minute. Um, but that's just for the first 30. And then after that it's a $5 a fucking minute for the first 30 minutes. So right now that was only a dollar a minute. Oh, okay. So he, she done shit. How so? How so what was that? How many minutes was that? Uh, I think we had her on her about, no, it was less than that. It was maybe 10. Okay. So hold on, hold on. Before we do that, before we do that, Aussie has the song cause it, cause like people have paid for something. So hold on. Is it, that took so long. Is it going to be easy to connect now or should you were caught up?

Speaker 10:         04:59:12       Now we're ready to just throw money. Right. Can you just, can you, should you start working on that and then Aussie will perform. So we're working on what, sorry, we're on the next call because I want to do one. Oh, you want him? You want to call back? Yeah. Yeah, we'll get, I don't want to talk to Ron a callback. It listens. A roxy isn't like we're, we're good guys. We're almost a 75. Come on. Keep it calm. And guys, this is, this is when the real fun starts. Once we get to 75, that's when it gets real wild and crazy. Well,

Speaker 8:          04:59:40       if ozzy is ready to go, I think we should probably do that. Okay. Go ahead. Do that. It's ready to go. Okay. All right. So hold on. Standby. Let me make sure we get her audio setup.

Speaker 15:         04:59:49       Yup. And ethical.

Speaker 8:          04:59:53       What's so for watch, her vocation is, was so sweet. Are Ripping people off. Yeah. She's like, I can't, she ended the call. Faith I'm going to do, I think she may be really believes those cards because she looked like don't do it. It's not going to work. And he's just like, oh. She's like, Oh fuck what have I. Oh wow.

Speaker 28:         05:00:12       Hey good.

Speaker 8:          05:00:14       Maybe to her it's not, it's maybe I should, uh, maybe so much take [inaudible] home. Save her.

Speaker 15:         05:00:19       Oof. I think so as, as Dan, is that is that is, that sounded good. You let, do you want to go home? They look, yeah, it looks a whole lot. Let me, uh, it's, it's, it's, it's this Mike, so, yeah, it's it there. You don't even like that. I don't know. I think, I think, I think it's gotta be sort of like both, just it again. Yeah, go ahead. Okay. That looks okay. All right.

Great. Now by the way,

Speaker 2:          05:09:59       the other a face tat core request I saw.

Speaker 6:          05:10:02       Oh hundreds. We'll take a look at that as well.

In other words were, you know, we got a couple of cake, right? Uh, Freddy free. Let me set this up. So Freddy Freaker. Oh Wow. Look at this. This is kind of creepy. Yeah, there used to be Justin, you've never seen this thing before.

Speaker 23:         05:10:22       Wait, wait, hit pause. A pause.

Speaker 6:          05:10:25       I just wanna I just wanna explain like in the fucking, like what? Like late, late eighties maybe like they, you know, they would do these like phone sex. Sure they had that. But also they were like anything we can do boggling. It's like call them any, exactly. You'd be like, talk to the fucking toy. I bought it with the garbage pail grants. Right. And so they were just, they kept making these up and this, this one was very brief. Like it only existed briefly as one of these and people saw it like at two in the morning and they thought like, was I hallucinating? Because it's not clear what they're advertising or trying to sell. And then it was just gone. And until the Internet, like a lot of people out there, we're just like, I think I was losing my mind. All right, let's, let's watch the free phone.

Speaker 23:         05:11:05       All my fucking, wow. You nailed it. By the way, by the way, I was looking at some references and a little greener. But is there, what's that? A person with a fingers. Listen, the sweet song, why do you, why are you calling? What are you calling for? This exists now wound up Chicago. All these curious. Yes. $2 car and

Speaker 3:          05:11:31       then he disappears. Yeah. That's pretty freaky. And that's all you know. So is it just a goof too. Dot. They're really trying to get people to call to talk to Freddy Freaker and what they're promising is, uh, it's the free phone. He's the party freak. Freddie freaker across the nation. He's a sensation. Call now. $2. All this is a drug only information. Like a message. Like there's no one else cause it's $2 per call. So they probably just play your prerecorded. Hey there. Welcome to the freak zone. We'll come to the party. Yeah, it's fucking pretty cute. Let me talk to her. Just some pervy guy who calls himself Freddy Freaker. But what if he tells you where the hotspots are to buy drugs? He's, it's like a, the the, the Alex Jones voice. Someone said, I've got, now let me tell you, uh, now, Freddy Freaker a lot of people.

Speaker 3:          05:12:19       Good. Not a lot of people say that. Fray. The freaker is the life of the party now. He now freddy barely takes enough happens to me when I do the record here. Maybe that the rep boy impression or not. I can't cook. He does cough. A fair amount. Alex Jones. Yeah. Every now and then there's a free course, a Goblin. Goblin blood. What's up Joey? Joey. Now Joey have a seat here because Joey Salads here. He's a good man. Now he, we're tattooing on him, but really what's in this tattoo is going to turn. It's going to make your penis small and that's why you need to be taking on. Oh, well joey letting out the globalist will happen. Don't be shy. We're going to get your butthole ripped out out. Joe got Corn is not joe. We've got a supplement here. It's made of, uh, what, what we do is we grind up kidney stones made from about Korean baby fortune.

Speaker 3:          05:13:18       And what you do is you take that and it lifts your testosterone levels so high that basically your penis are going to blast out of your pants like a rocket to the moon. Man, I never actually went into the movement. This will make your penis. Well Kayla goober bake that for the resident of this guy. That's the best impression in the room. Sorry, the keys to just, uh, you know, just lit up really badly. Now. What did he say about the church? But you got something to write it up. Don't be shy now destroyed the child. Don't be shy. Bot Mitchell's looking real good over there now, but look, I'm real fine or whatever that do I needed to grant, uh, that was me or no, that wasn't you. That was Alex. Yeah. Yeah. Shredder or I mean shredder, frankly speaking now that was Freddie freaker. Now, now, now the coastal liberals will have you believe that? Uh No joey, why are you laughing? Because you know now Joey, cause Alex Jones is hilarious. Not hilarious. This is serious and I know I'm trying to warm the people. I put it in a humble [inaudible] of him up just doing the, you don't need a copulation sorry.

Speaker 8:          05:14:31       I like the one person who asks for Freddy. Freaker is definitely not going to see that this drawing is there. I just love that this is, this is in there for the one person who's heard of this thing. I would have sworn that you guys would know what that is. I never heard. It's so fucking weird. And there's like a puppet tier guy who like look on reddit explaining like, oh I'm the one who designed pretty frequent. I don't know why. Like the people who paid me, they never do

Speaker 2:          05:14:50       told me what it was. It was a device by liberals to brainwash the kids you call a bop to party. But what they're actually doing is that they're whispering this liberal messages from another dimension. Right. And they're company in your ear and what is just doing as a target? Neat. Our kids, transsexual. Okay. And kids are chopping off their penises. They're tucking. The penis is in there growing vaginas and it's all Freddie Freaker is, is spreading subliminal messages. You know, I know Hillary Clinton frog and it's not furby greater this monstrosity. Oh, knows he's on campuses. He's destroying free speech. He just wants people to call the free catiline. Frankly, he sounds like a cool guy. Oh, you call that fruit hotline?

Speaker 18:         05:27:59       I just want to talk to a psychic man. Yeah, I mean I'm really surprised that it's that hard to get ahold of them. I'm surprised that they hang up on you. It's like if you're a psychic, your phone's not ringing off the hook. You should be really excited. Just let me fuck with you, dude. That lady could have still been on the line still getting those $5 every minute. They don't care about the money. They're dedicated and given people there. You think it's all about the real big beat. I'm starting to maybe think that list based on that. That last girl was like, I don't want to waste your money. I'm hanging, you know, which is crazy. I was blown away. I don't want to waste your money is mind blowing to me. Let me tell you about these psychics sub. A lot of people think that they're fake, but every single one of them is real man. Break it and consulted board parker brothers, they are part of the Illuminati. Destroyed the child. Can't do that. I kept you the super deep. That's the hardest to do. How does anyone do a voice that deep destroyed the child has an incredible voice. He does have an amazing, beautiful voice. If he wasn't like a horrible, I think he once said that he was, he got a lot of offers to do trailers for movies. Oh, interesting. Thank you Alex. In a world

Speaker 37:         05:40:50       I'm fine. How are you?

Speaker 18:         05:40:52       Let me ask you how, what's your a spread, you know, are you good with dreams? Do you know how to analyze dreams? I had a doozy. Well, where do I begin? Oh,

Speaker 37:         05:41:07       just by telling me about the injury. Okay. And or asking whatever questions you have.

Speaker 38:         05:41:13       Okay. Well I, myself, I'm about 65 and my pappy passed when I was still around, uh, 12. So it's been a long time since I've seen my pappy, but I'm what was visited in my dreams last night by my pappy and uh, it's a strange one. So bear with me. It's a little embarrassing. So I hope you forgive me. Um, okay. Well my back while I was sleeping in my bed, I was a little boy and my pappy come in my room.

Speaker 14:         05:41:48       Yeah.

Speaker 38:         05:41:49       And he lifted the blanket and say more. He said, Ma, ma, little johnny, that's my name, Jonathan. He called me little johnny. He says, well, a little Jonathan. I had peed the bed and it was soaking wet all the way and the dream I was, there was so much yarn. It was like I didn't stop and the whole room was filling up with a yard. And so he comes swimming in and he said, boy, a little Joanie, let me, uh, let me turn the faucet off for you. And this we want to get real embarrassing because he put his mouth on, you know, uh, you know, on my penis, my little penis. And he say, let me turn the faucet off for you, a little johnny and he suck and you suck and all the gear and come out. And he's turned it off, like turned it off with his mouth and then the urine keep slowly drain it out of the room. The urine. Well, I'm getting a little emotional and the urine clear out. And when it was dry, my pappy lay down next to me and the bed and he gave me a tend to hug and he kissed me on the neck and he said, little johnny, I just want you to know that anytime you need me to suck on your a little penis.

Speaker 14:         05:43:01       Well, yeah.

Speaker 38:         05:43:08       Disappeared. He was a ghost. So what do you, what do you think about it?

Speaker 37:         05:43:14       So let me ask you a question. When you were 12 before he passed, were you ever afraid of him?

Speaker 38:         05:43:25       Well, yes, because sometimes my pathway would come home and he would, uh, what, what he was a nurse and he sometimes he would, he would change colostomy bags or the old folks and he would come, smelled of urine at home. And I thought that was our thought. That was a little strange. And I do think, well, yes, I was very terrified on my pappy.

Speaker 37:         05:43:54       Okay. Second question. Did you really peed the bed when you were young?

Speaker 38:         05:44:00       Oh yes. I peed the bed a lot and fact I, okay. I'm ashamed to admit it once again cause it's quite embarrassing. But I, well I sleep with rubber sheets because that had been, I'm afraid has never, uh Huh. I'm afraid that habit is not a left me.

Speaker 37:         05:44:25       Beautiful thing about this can really be your breakthrough of being able to leave this pattern. So the metaphysical reason for peeing in the bed, it's fear of a parent, especially a male parent. So it makes sense that a with the way you felt about him, that you would do it and that b, that your memory of him would involve that. So the sucking away represents you suck in a way. This kind of, if I'm looking at my father who think about it in the dream, he was so sensitive and he was so tender and he was so loving, so kind. So when he was here, you paid attention to the scary part. Now years later you ready to move into this next part of your life. So you made it to leave that pattern behind. So you focused on the tinder, they're loving, tender and loving part was there when he was alive. That's true. Not what you focused on as a kid.

Speaker 38:         05:45:42       Well that's true. He wants Mary tend to with the whole what? The penis and the mouth. But the problem I'm having now, and I do think what you said was fascinating, I'm really struck by it, but the problem is I've gotten my wife and she has a thing she likes and I don't know how this all connect, but she liked to poop in the bed. I tell you and I'm, I'm okay with it because, well, my father used to poop in the bed and he thought it was a good time, but my wife is into it now and I think it's a little uncomfortable too. I like, I loved the wife, but I sometimes think there's a little too much poop in the bed.

Speaker 39:         05:46:25       Oh wait real quick. I just want to say real quick, hold on. Before you start talking, I just want to say also that I, I in my dreams, I would poop in the bed too. And I used to poop and spray poop all over the room. And lately, and this is why I'm calling the last few days, I'm just been Skorton ropes a poop out of my butt all into my bed and I, and that's why I'm calling, I'm trying to figure out, is this some sort of source that this is coming from where I'm just Skorton these ropes.

Speaker 37:         05:47:04       So what you're saying is that in your quest to move away from urinating in the bed, you think it may disrupt what your wife likes. So tell me. Okay.

Speaker 39:         05:47:18       I'm worried about that. It might have something to do with this. In my quest is get away from urinating in the bed that it's now been the door to Skorton brown ropes in the bed. Just huge turd snake.

Speaker 14:         05:47:36       Yeah.

Speaker 37:         05:47:38       So what is it that your wife likes? What form that she preferred?

Speaker 38:         05:47:43       Well, my wife likes it when the poops in the bed and I think it's fine, you know, every once in a while. But she asks me every evening, I tried to go to the bathroom. I liked to, you know, uh, let it out before the bedtime. But she says, no. She says, no, Johnny, I want you to poop right here in the bed. And she likes to cuddle because we lost a child and she likes to pretend that the poop is the child.

Speaker 14:         05:48:11       So if she cuts,

Speaker 37:         05:48:15       does it matter to her? Which one of yours, whether it's hers or yours, in terms of pretending is the child?

Speaker 39:         05:48:22       Well, I, you know, it's just the most important thing, not so much about the child, it's just that having shooting these ropes, a snake like poop in the bed, just splattering them all in around the bed and, and pn in the bed and just, it's a wild situation.

Speaker 14:         05:48:46       Okay.

Speaker 37:         05:48:47       Is,

Speaker 39:         05:48:48       and I mean, I feel that, oh, I'm sorry to interrupt, but I feel like that's the most important part of the conversation.

Speaker 14:         05:48:57       Okay.

Speaker 39:         05:48:58       You know, I keep bringing up my wife, I keep bringing up my wife and all this other stuff, but really it's about me just Skorton these brown rope, snake ropes, just shooting these snake ropes out

Speaker 14:         05:49:11       it.

Speaker 37:         05:49:17       I totally get it. And I do think that's important, but we have to relate it back to the dream. The dream is, was this conversation. So I think that there's some significance to the fact that you're paying on a bed of fear of a parent who is the male period. So when you started telling me about your wife, it made me think about the actual activity that your father did in the drink

Speaker 39:         05:49:47       real quick. One last thing is, I don't, when I say my wife, I should make it clear that, I mean my pillow because I don't actually have a wife. I have a pillow, but I, but to me that is, but to me that is, is my wife and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and I'm, well it's, it's a little ball of cotton inside of the pillow is, but, but, but to me, but to me it's a real baby. And I want to just say that when I'm Skorton these snake, like, like four feet.

Speaker 14:         05:50:28       Yeah.

Speaker 37:         05:50:36       Johnny.

Speaker 14:         05:50:38       Yeah.

Speaker 39:         05:50:39       I'm sorry. When, I'm sorry. When I'm scoring these four feet snake, like ropes of Poop, snake ropes in my bed, I'm starting to put that onto my pillow wife and I'm starting to project the, she's doing that. But it's really me and I'm by myself and I'm by myself and, and I, and I'm a bit, I'm a bit ashamed to, to, to come out just right out of the gate and admit that. So that's, that's my problem.

Speaker 37:         05:51:13       That's okay. I want to just be yourself. So can we please go back to the dream? Tell me the part again about what your dad was doing to get rid of the urine.

Speaker 38:         05:51:23       So my daddy, what had my little, my little baby penis in his mouth and he kept on suck in and buttons it.

Speaker 14:         05:51:36       Yeah.

Speaker 37:         05:51:38       Yeah. I think there's some significance there. I think that that's the key. The key is that your father,

Speaker 39:         05:51:45       well, just to, just to make it clear, just not to interrupt, but I just want to let you know that one important part of my dream is that my dad, he was actually in my dream was a pillow.

Speaker 14:         05:52:02       Okay,

Speaker 39:         05:52:02       so it wasn't your real no, no, no. In the junior real path know, in, in the dream. My, pappy was a beautiful, like a long pillow, like one of those leg pit, like the kind of pillows you put it between your legs and cuddle with. And in my dream and, and, and, and when I say suck, I think more accurately would be brushed up against because he was a pillow and, and I, I'm so confused and contort it about these things, but I don't know, I just think that it's more, I'm just, I'm, I'm fighting against being truthful with you and, and, and then, you know, the, the fantasy that, that the, the lies, you know, the truthfulness and the lies.

Speaker 38:         05:52:52       So my question is, who do I pee? I should I pee or poop in the bed?

Speaker 14:         05:52:58       Okay.

Speaker 37:         05:53:01       Well, I think that's a good question, Johnny. But I think a deeper way to look at it is, what does it mean when you visualize your wife, when you're awake and your father when you're asleep,

Speaker 39:         05:53:16       but they're both close. Oh,

Speaker 37:         05:53:19       exactly. That's the significance right there. That's where you really have to look at and say, what does that mean? That, um, you had a real,

Speaker 39:         05:53:28       there's another piece of information. It's the important thing. You should know that I'm an heir to a large pillow company. I can't say which, because it's very private and I only grew up around pillows and I only have pillows around me and I refuse. I'm very rich, so I've sent away all human interaction, only pillow interaction. So, and people that help me and work with me or in giant pillow suits, uh, and that could be a part of it. And I've been living that way for the last 17 years. But, uh, I don't know.

Speaker 37:         05:54:14       No, you're, you're real. Pappy died when you were 12, is that correct? That's right. He really was. He really did work at the hospital and deal with those [inaudible] bags. Correct.

Speaker 38:         05:54:26       Oh, well that's so that poppy. So that was the poppy. That was my pillow, but my real poppy was the, the owner. He established a big below company. I don't want to say which one it was. Oh, of course. But uh, the one that was changing colostomy bags as a nurse. Well that one was a, that one was a pillow.

Speaker 14:         05:54:48       Okay.

Speaker 37:         05:54:49       Oh, I see. Now. It all makes sense to me.

Speaker 39:         05:54:53       So what do you, what? What do you think I should do? Like just, I'm going to let you talk and sort of let me know what you think.

Speaker 14:         05:55:02       Yeah.

Speaker 37:         05:55:04       Well Johnny, I think that both pee and poop represent parts of your life that you want to release, parts that you want to get rid of to excrete. So the form does it really matter. What matters is that you continue to have a method to be able to take all the things that you deal with in life and be able to release them. So the question of which form of release should I use is less important than it should. I believe the answer is yes, you have to release because it's really a symbol. It's a symbol for the, what has gotten you this far in life is your ability to be able to take in things and then be able to release them so you're not holding on to them. That's the real significance here, jen.

Speaker 38:         05:55:57       That's incredible that you were able to decipher that. So I will tell my wife that you said I will keep shitting in the bed and that's fine. And that, uh, I'm sorry, what was your name again?

Speaker 18:         05:56:56       I also just want to say that

Speaker 39:         05:56:58       I called in, I paid for the Guinness World Book of Records People to come and uh, I do squirt the longest brown snake ropes out of my butt in w in my bed and I think I might get a Guinness World record for that. So I'm pretty excited about that. So that's at least a bright, that's one at least bright, bright light in my life. So I thought I'd let you know about them.

Speaker 38:         05:57:25       They really would. Thank you for sharing that Johnny. Well thank you. Thank you for your call, but thank you for listening. I hope that you'll be pooping in your own bed cuddling. Get Ben. Appreciate Ya. Right. Take care now. Bye Bye. Bye Bye.

Speaker 18:         05:57:44       So I have a question real quick, real quick. God, anybody here skate? Whoa, wait, we got a lot to talk about. What just happened? Well, I all, I can tell you it's fucking ethan comedic sensibilities and I'm like stop. Like I keep trying to reroute it like you're talking about like, like child rape. I'm like, can we make this more about like it was a dream because the headline here is how that guy commonly encouraged you to never stop shitting for the rest of your life. Pull you around like a localizer headline. Fairly impressed. I was really impressed. Like the type of people we're going to be calling this person up or people who are at the end of their rope who have a lot of legitimate problems and you could just like scam him and this guy's like, at least this is a voice to talk to.

Speaker 18:         05:58:34       He's like kind. He's gentle. I'm pretty impressed with psychics. Yeah, two for two. For two. The first one didn't want to take your money. Second one was just like, you couldn't face him. By the way, that was my real problem in life. That guy helped me like that was, I think he's like a good therapist and calling themselves shitting the bed for 17 years. You know, now's not the time to stop. Keep shitting that bed. Little Johnny. He's just like, keep going. Just don't feel bad about it guys. I mean, I got to say, first of all, I do want to say that we did hit 75,000 words back, read 76,000 all we did it. We did it, guys

Speaker 16:         05:59:12       do. Well, let's do the pepper and then we'll do our thing. Yeah, perfect. That best way to do it.

Speaker 18:         05:59:23       Okay, sure. As you guys are doing the call, I already ate the peppers. So yeah, those donation money's coming. They're going for a good cause guys. It was a dream. My Dad didn't, he peed in the kid beat. He stuck the pee out of the room through his penis. Was that an autumn reasonable day? I was trying to steer it back onto a well, I appreciate the poop snake. I was just trying to make it just trying to, I just wanted to get it back into where we're all laughing really hard and not going, Oh God, this is maybe a little too real for some people. Wait, where the fuck? Yeah. Well, you know, I was just a feeling you're just having fun. We're all having fun. I want to make you feel bad. Um, do we? Wow. Wow. The question is, and we don't even know what this third song is. I know what the fourth song did he know that there was two of us when we were goofing around cause he was taking it very serious. I don't think he did because I was copying your pitch was like raising and [inaudible].

Speaker 18:         06:00:29       My name is miss social experiments where like a white guy will be there and then they'll turn around and then like a black guy stands up and they act like nothing happened. No. Yeah. Are only paying attention with like 30% of their brain. And they tend to like that video where there's like a, there's like a guy in a gorilla suit. Yeah, yeah. Ask a ball field and you're like, did you see most people just tend to kind of assumed you it again and you're like, oh, these 6,000 I wonder what the CEO of direct really thought of that call. Oh, so sorry to the CEO of [inaudible]. I was making, sorry. No, all about poop and stuff and you are making it about your bottle or whatever. He was sucking urine out of my penis to help bring the room guy. The important thing is $76,000 and $76,000 for charity. Patrice Wilson. I'm still watching.

Speaker 7:          06:01:58       I think we could do it. Let's do it. I'm down. I mean it's going to be a 10 hour stream, but oh no, I don't. By the way, if we open it up and doesn't look happy about that, we, if we opened up aussies, we, there'd be like a ton more. Like, all right, here we go. Throw it to her. Hey wait, wait. How does this sound though? Like in the, in the old setup switching. So we're going to switch over to music mode now, so, okay. Okay. So don't start. Don't start until they go ahead and up. Keep doing that so they can hear

Speaker 40:         06:02:28       good check, check

Speaker 32:         06:03:06       to see the words.

Speaker 10:         06:05:29       Wow. Wow. Nope. No, dude, this is incredible. You've never heard the song before you went out of the room and by the way, you were ready a long time ago, so no Aussie fucking nailed it. Chaos. Chaos. If you want more. So that was a, that was a year zero by ghost. And that was donation was from a tech data tech data. Tag it up. Dan, do we have any other more writing or are we good to go to the pepper? No, no. We got to go to the pepper. We are so ready for the pepper, but, but I just want to say that aussies still has one more song. Ready? No, you got it. I paid for that one. It's a minor one. Did you grab that one? Okay. Bull Shit. You're doing it. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Also Dan, should we open it up for more Aussie songs?

Speaker 10:         06:06:18       I mean that's, that's up to you guys ultimately. Um, a, by the way, Justin, even, what do you think a lot of the donations are saying that you're setting up the skateboard wrong? I don't know if that's accurate. Not really. Yeah, but they saw you doing it. I know there's been multiple people saying that. So am I fucking it up? I don't know. Let's go. You're probably right. I'm a little guy. It's pepper time. No, I'm not sure at all. I'm just saying what the donation stream. I think it's good and can get somebody just like donate $10 any $10 donations. I'll read your comments and like, tell me, am I doing it wrong or what?

Speaker 10:         06:06:54       I feel like the trucks might be wrong. I'm not going to lie. I think that's what people are, but I feel like I got the trucks right. Like our, aren't the bushings going in or do the, are the bushing is going out, but waiting for Groin for advice guys, am I the only way they can communicate with those? Like, I know, like, I fucking know this and I'm like, just being retarded, I think. I think, I think, you know what? I think they're right. I think would go out. Oh No. What have I done? Well, that's just on me. I got a fucking, uh, just re-installed the bush, but I feel like, I feel like that's the way it goes. Right. You're asking the wrong dude, man. I got on a skateboard for two seconds and Mike, can we get a, can we get like Tony Hawk or somebody on the line? Do you think about it? I was trying to drop Peter Griffin. What do you think? It's more, it's more good, right? Keep going. Yeah. That little spot. Like make that be more, more Simpson. Okay, got it. That's, that's a, that's a fucking bat. That will go for some money.

Well we'll have a, we're doing, like Ethan said, we're doing like a report this Friday. Took over everything and uh, yeah, we'll, we'll definitely shout out all these awesome donations up dog. She changed her name to up dog. I'm a girl asshole because I kept guessing the gender. Ron Up dog wants to hurry up. You are so thirsty for these two thick boys to lock list. I never had someone donated in total up dog.

Speaker 18:         07:03:24       I think it's amazing. We're pretty impressed. You guys are crushing it. You guys are fucking crushing it. We're almost a 94,000 this is incredible. This is a, this is a holiday miracle right there. I'm rallying right now. Awesome. I didn't think we were going to make it. You guys are fucking Joey. How do you feel seeing these numbers right? I'm excited but scared at the same time. Every time I see a big donation I'm like now Dan is legitimately worried. He keeps taking me aside and being like, I don't know if we should make them. I'm worried for myself as well. My stomach still gargling and it's like my God, I can't not do it. I don't want to, I don't want him. I don't want a medical emergency. On our hands. Well, maybe make him eat the whole thing. Just half of the whole thing. So just take a bite. I'm not even, I wasn't even screaming before when I, when I felt like I was on a pest out, like, oh, I didn't think so. Yeah.

Speaker 3:          07:04:16       So what we're going to do joey, and you don't have to commit to this. Okay. Um, first of all, we have to, there's two Carolina reapers. Which one looked? This one kind of looks less scary to me. This one looks like more lame, but you can decide which bag do you want to hit up? Let's wait for Justin. It's before we take the call and media to eat. So you think you think those ones, I mean they probably does it really, I don't know. You decide, you pick your poison as they say and literally, yeah. But would you still rather get pepper sprayed or would you rather do the question? Yeah, yeah. I think I'll be good if we just take a bite out of it. So here, let's see. I'm going to pick one out for you. A small one.

Speaker 17:         07:04:59       Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:05:01       It's crazy. Yeah, I'm going to have to at least need a real small one minute. What do you think? That's still, I mean, I'm reading up on this pepper right now and uh, there's like multiple farmers being like, Oh God, no, you would never put the thing in your mouth. Well, you put a little bit in it for cooking. You know what I'm saying? Like, well, people do. It is, it is something people do for a challenge. Okay. All right. Like retinal link have done it. I've written linky they were fine, fine as a, you know, subjective, but they survived. God, that smells so strong. Dude. Smell that. That's a Carolina reaper. Well, the second, you know, spiciest pepper in the world. Now smell that Alex. I mean, that is fucking putrid, man.

Speaker 17:         07:05:48       Okay.

Speaker 3:          07:05:49       You can be like, yeah, send, sent shivers down your spine. I think I saw somebody fake eating a online and it was like, I'm sure there's a lot of people faking it. So, hey guys, uh, c k nine, see who's been donating a ton all night, Aka Jack is his real name. Thank you. Jack is on the line. So I'm going to pop them in right now. What's that?

Why the one song that I pick? God dammit. So, uh, can you, can you tell me the suggestion? Here's what we decided with Joey. We've got this too by the way. Went to a good cause. Okay. I know, I know, I know. I feel like, I feel like, I feel like a, a fan. Like, Hey, I, I paid for Justin and, and just want to see Ethan shake that make out. And it didn't happen. Just Justin, Jesse Var, everyone's decided that they want you to eat the pepper instead of fucking shit. So Justin were talking about, uh, what Joey's going to eat now. Here's the smallest one. We can find it. Are you going to nibble kind of the tip? Like what are you comfortable with? Just the tip. Just the tip or are we talking about guys? We can, we can just cut the tip off. I feel you eat the tip or the stem. I mean this shaft. I mean like the head of the penis. Which part do you want to head?

Know what I want to in consolidate, consolidate, consolidate and consolidate.

Speaker 8:          07:12:10       Consolidate. By the way, by the way, we've been going for seven and a half hours. My charitable motherfucker. It feels like 20 hours. There's a lot of charitable energy in this room, so when are you going to like black pepper? This is why I think Aussie needs to learn the last song and I think because here's what's going to happen. We're going to hit a hundred and joy's can have to use that last pepper and we need it. We need a beautiful song. Yeah. I mean you're not arguing with us. We're not in charge of what have herb or not. That's up to her man. Have her play as we do the outro. I'm going to lick this fucking pepper. Y'All want to do that or I want to see it now. I don't want us, I want to see it. Justin smelling like tension music. Do we have any like kind of intense with the tension going stand by. Okay. This tension music's coming up. I'm going to look at, don't do anything stupid though because you're drunk, but give it a lift. Bite. Bite the tip. Give it a look. Just just eat it. Then I'll

Speaker 18:         07:13:10       tell you what. I will like this. If Aussie goes and play and learn this song, so she's in the other room. If she learns, I will look to the song has to learn the song and come in and play the song. Okay, here we go ahead. Oh Yup. Might as well eat it at that. Oh boy. God, Joey. Justin went in for a little suck. Yeah, a little sucky suck that you're doing. Okay. You might have to fight it. That's apparently no, I can tell you from experience, just touching it to your lips. Yo, he's just sobered up the spiciest pepper in the world, dude. And I'll tell you what, I did that. Now I want Asi to play Justin war winning. Whatever this argument is with argument. It's just, what's that hot? It's really good song and I'll see you shit. How's the pen? We've got the pepper. Uh, it's, it's a spicy, and this is going to be my home.

All right. How are you feeling about the whole thing in his mouth and he didn't react? There's long as audrey problems turned up inside my mouth. She's not in the room right now, but I'm sure they're learning the song. I think so. I'm going to give it, I'm going to give it a good shot. I'm going to do it. What do they, you go first.

Speaker 15:         07:37:33       Okay. So no, no, no. Start at the c level story about 14. Okay. Okay. So no, no, I mean it's, it's a real, it's a real fucking, it's a real thing. And is, this is a partnership between, between me, uh, between squatch games and, and, um, and um, and, uh, uh, uh, crows, Crows, crows, which is one of the, they did the Stanley parable. One of the best, by the way, if you haven't played the Stanley parable, fuck you go on steam right now. And by the Stanley parable, it's a fucking name. If I'm not even kidding, if you have not played that game, fucking get on there and play it. It's fucking amazing. It's brilliant. It's a brilliant game. But anyways, he level so, so, so, yeah. So is there a zoo level? Well, guess what? Yeah, there is. And, and they, they went out of their fucking, uh, they went out, they went out of their way to make sure that you couldn't just like data dump the fucking game.

Speaker 15:         07:38:41       Um, God, it, this isn't, there's so it exists. It exists. You can play it. They went out of their way to make sure you couldn't, you couldn't just like do like a, like a data dump of the entire row, uh, the game, you know, all, all the data, the game and like find it and go, oh, there it is and here's what we have to do to get to it. Like, pretty, pretty, pretty, like, pretty like awesome. Like, you know, Revolutionary Indie Shit. Um, so there you have it and the [inaudible] and the fuck is who level does exist and, and like good luck finding it because nobody has yet. Oh, for real. It's an Easter egg that nobody's, nobody's found and, and, and um, yeah, yeah. And, and, and I think a big part of is because they're like, picked it up. They made sure that you couldn't actually, for teaching me to love myself. Love you guys. All right, well there you haggle. Dan, can you set up, I seriously want to do for $2,000 goal. We mean Justin will

Speaker 18:         07:39:52       finally give her a little peck. Okay. Why do you want a thousand dollar goal? Because they keep begging for it so I don't want to let him went down. Yeah. But I want to go 2000 starting when, right. Well when I just want Dan to set up a bowl. Okay, no problem. Also, we've passed the eight hour mark, which I think is actually the Max that the live stream we'll store said, are you for real? Yeah. I mean maybe we could talk to youtube and see if they can make an exception for us, but uh, we, we might either have to re up load or the end of this is going to get cut off. No, we're way, if you're watching live just literally never done an eight or a license, then that means fucking this. This is a special that we share. Are we sure about that?

Speaker 18:         07:40:38       That. That's a thing I can definitely for sure it is a thing at least because we didn't get the seven hour and 40 minute mark, so we're not that dangerous. Okay. Okay. Okay. Joey's eating that pepper we got to get, no, he's not. We got to get him and we're only have 20 minutes left. Hold on.

And most importantly we've learned that putting your feet in a rotten milk, we'll give you a nice glossy finish on your feet. Is that right? That is true. Well, okay, Joe, you're a trooper and we thank you all so much for your service. You're doing okay. All right. Joey, your legend, man. Yeah. Big, big up. Big applause. Good job. What a legend.

You want to fucking you in a fucking, not give as much money away to, sorry for victims of the, we're reaching eight hours, which at that point youtube cuts it off. So there's literally, oh, is youtube the one that's going to say, sorry, you almost raised a bunch of money for poor people in California that we're fucked over by a fire. It is us rich youtube. People are going to have to say no. We draw the line. Here it is burning my mouth now. I'm like, thank you. Nothing. So Dan is, do we, so we owe a couple of calls, is that right? Is that it? Uh, it just one actually, and they, they sent me an alternate number, so let me try him right now and if we could squeeze it in real quick, that would be awesome. And then do we have another song? Is Aussie want to perform one more song? Yeah, I don't think she's going to tell that. I don't think. I don't mind. I just, I don't want to let her down. If she's ready. She's going here. I don't think she's doing it. Awesome. And then let me know if there's any other big ones that we've got to shout out. You guys are amazing. One Oh four. I mean, this is like, I'm, I'm honestly so happy. Yeah, I'm blown away. This is fucking amazing. You guys are so, oh, did you set up the, uh, the milestone for the kiss?

Sarah, is it possible for you to set up a, uh, incentive, the 2000 mark for a little smudge?

Speaker 28:         07:52:15       Because we're not going to make it.

Speaker 8:          07:52:18       Who gives a fuck? All right. We got six minutes apparently according to Dan to kind of make the most of it. I'm just going to wait.

Speaker 8:          07:52:28       Why don't we, uh, why don't we let you too. Why don't we stop and start new new stream? No, what do we know? It's not good.

It's like I got all the memes in my head and I'm like how do I capture the memes and the man at the same time? Interesting. I'm happening. You've done a good one of me in the past. It takes a minute though. It's hard after it. It was even harder to draw. I'm donating the last dollar. I love you all and have been watching the whole stream.
