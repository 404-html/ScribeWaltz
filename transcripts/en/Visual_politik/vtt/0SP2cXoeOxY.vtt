1
00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Unless you are watching this video from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>

2
00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.170
<v Speaker 1>it's fair to say that no matter how bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation in your country,</v>

3
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is doing worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as of 2015,</v>

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.113
<v Speaker 1>they are experiencing more inflation </v>
<v Speaker 1>than any other country in the entire </v>

5
00:00:23.291 --> 00:00:24.550
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

6
00:00:24.551 --> 00:00:29.380
<v Speaker 1>their capital Caracas is currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>ranked as being the world's most violent</v>

7
00:00:29.381 --> 00:00:30.214
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>beating out other famously violent </v>

8
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:33.730
<v Speaker 1>cities in both Mexico and it's okay.</v>

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.583
<v Speaker 2>Columbia,</v>

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.463
<v Speaker 1>something as simple as buying toilet </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper has also become a practically </v>

11
00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:46.180
<v Speaker 1>impossible in Venezuela and scarcity has</v>
<v Speaker 1>become a norm in supermarkets.</v>

12
00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.260
<v Speaker 1>Other products such as condoms have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be bought and sold on the black market,</v>

13
00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.183
<v Speaker 1>and all of this is happening in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with the world's largest oil </v>

14
00:00:54.761 --> 00:00:55.960
<v Speaker 1>reserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

15
00:00:55.961 --> 00:00:59.140
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't so long ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuela was the richest country in</v>

16
00:00:59.141 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the whole of South America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today,</v>

17
00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 1>over half the population lives in </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

18
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.000
<v Speaker 1>So the big question is how did they ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>up there?</v>

19
00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.290
<v Speaker 1>How did the government destroy the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy in such a short amount of time?</v>

20
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

21
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the variant revolution,</v>

22
00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the first character in our story is Hugo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chavez.</v>

23
00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>The father of modern day Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or should we say the Bolivarian Republic</v>

24
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:26.973
<v Speaker 1>of Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became presidents after a landslide </v>

25
00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:33.280
<v Speaker 1>victory in 1999.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His campaign was based on the promise of</v>

26
00:01:33.281 --> 00:01:34.114
<v Speaker 1>equality and poverty reduction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a policy that he called 21st century </v>

27
00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:41.290
<v Speaker 1>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of his first policies was called the</v>

28
00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:42.124
<v Speaker 1>system for the democratization of jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was meant to be implemented in the </v>

29
00:01:45.461 --> 00:01:46.294
<v Speaker 1>PD Vsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stage company that extracts </v>

30
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:49.654
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela's oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't forget now that we're talking </v>

31
00:01:51.701 --> 00:01:55.930
<v Speaker 1>about a country that has a bigger oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves than Saudi Arabia.</v>

32
00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

33
00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.680
<v Speaker 3>vsas payroll has more than doubled to a </v>
<v Speaker 3>hundred and 15,000</v>

34
00:02:05.681 --> 00:02:06.514
<v Speaker 3>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

35
00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.353
<v Speaker 3>Chavez took office in 1999 and that has </v>
<v Speaker 3>recent them since 2006 to 34 billion US </v>

36
00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:14.860
<v Speaker 3>dollars.</v>

37
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.693
<v Speaker 1>This was pretty big news considering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>VSA is the largest company in South </v>

38
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:20.501
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

39
00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela kept producing the same number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of barrels per year.</v>

40
00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.270
<v Speaker 1>This means that the staff increase had </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing to do with corporate reasons,</v>

41
00:02:28.271 --> 00:02:30.580
<v Speaker 1>but rather political ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

42
00:02:30.581 --> 00:02:31.414
<v Speaker 1>this job or democratization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a way to employ all of the </v>

43
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:37.780
<v Speaker 1>unemployed Venezuelans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens in the government</v>

44
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 1>during the Chavez administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public spending,</v>

45
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 2>this</v>

46
00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.053
<v Speaker 1>men's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more government workers and more social </v>

47
00:02:46.951 --> 00:02:49.170
<v Speaker 1>programs have an ever before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

48
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.033
<v Speaker 1>none of this was a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As long as the oil exports kept paying </v>

49
00:02:52.831 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>the bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

50
00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Chavez cut poverty in half despite being</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oil rich country.</v>

51
00:02:57.631 --> 00:03:00.370
<v Speaker 1>Before Chavez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sixty percent of the population lived in</v>

52
00:03:00.371 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years after Chavez,</v>

53
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:03.423
<v Speaker 1>only 30 percent did display ship as his </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric that capitalist countries were </v>

54
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:10.990
<v Speaker 1>trying to destroy the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one would reject Venezuela's oil.</v>

55
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>Even Nicolas Sarcozi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Francis Conservative presidents over the</v>

56
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.550
<v Speaker 1>volume was complimenting Venezuela's</v>

57
00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.630
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's with their strong turnout.</v>

58
00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.400
<v Speaker 1>The shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

59
00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:30.580
<v Speaker 1>the vitality of democracy in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these policies we must add the</v>

60
00:03:30.801 --> 00:03:35.801
<v Speaker 1>famous know I've got this literally </v>
<v Speaker 1>means expropriate.</v>

61
00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.570
<v Speaker 1>This expropriation being the taking away</v>
<v Speaker 1>of private property from its owner.</v>

62
00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Chavez was no fan of private businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was not uncommon for him to visit</v>

63
00:03:45.711 --> 00:03:50.000
<v Speaker 1>a city and go around declaring that </v>
<v Speaker 1>various businesses being nationalized.</v>

64
00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.040
<v Speaker 1>This would include all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>

65
00:03:52.041 --> 00:03:52.874
<v Speaker 1>including things like small shops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this ended up with Venezuela </v>

66
00:03:56.241 --> 00:03:57.074
<v Speaker 1>having an economy if it was fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependent on its oil buying 2012 brands </v>

67
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.850
<v Speaker 1>barrels when 95 percent of Venezuela's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports.</v>

68
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:09.080
<v Speaker 1>We should also note here that PD and </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher costs than any other oil company,</v>

69
00:04:09.081 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 1>and this was largely because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff increases.</v>

70
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.613
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as the oil price remains high </v>

71
00:04:14.151 --> 00:04:14.984
<v Speaker 1>enough to cover the production costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Venezuela kept making oil and </v>

72
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.040
<v Speaker 1>everyone was happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:22.670
<v Speaker 1>just hold on a minute because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>where things turn sour.</v>

74
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:27.730
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 oil prices fell in Venezuela was</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first country to feel the effects of</v>

75
00:04:27.891 --> 00:04:28.724
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For their profit per barrel shrank and </v>

76
00:04:30.291 --> 00:04:32.300
<v Speaker 1>more and more every single day.</v>

77
00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.290
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

78
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>last now by that time the oil crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

79
00:04:39.841 --> 00:04:40.674
<v Speaker 1>Hugo Chavez had already passed away and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his successor was a guy named Nicolas </v>

80
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.120
<v Speaker 1>Maduro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I always look at me funny.</v>

81
00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Then flew over my head and I could feel </v>
<v Speaker 1>the spirit of Chavez in the field.</v>

82
00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:00.180
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a joke,</v>

83
00:05:00.181 --> 00:05:01.014
<v Speaker 1>nor is it a quote taken out of context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maduro found himself the head of the </v>

84
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 1>country that wasn't making enough money </v>
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>

85
00:05:06.241 --> 00:05:09.870
<v Speaker 1>It's only export and Maduro had wages to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay.</v>

86
00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.823
<v Speaker 1>Then on top of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the famous now because of all </v>

87
00:05:14.311 --> 00:05:15.144
<v Speaker 1>that expropriating that was going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been left with a Venezuela that </v>

88
00:05:17.761 --> 00:05:22.050
<v Speaker 1>has no private companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even if he decided to raise taxes,</v>

89
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.913
<v Speaker 1>there's no one left the pavement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is when Missouri made the most </v>

90
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.400
<v Speaker 1>irresponsible decision that any </v>
<v Speaker 1>political leader can make.</v>

91
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>He decided to print money having </v>
<v Speaker 1>devalued the Venezuelan currency,</v>

92
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:37.740
<v Speaker 1>the believer inflation skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example of how bad this was.</v>

93
00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.910
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're sitting in a bar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>crackers in July of 2016,</v>

94
00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.330
<v Speaker 1>met emily called steel around 50 bullet </v>
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>

95
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.490
<v Speaker 1>Then you go back to the same bar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caracas in September,</v>

96
00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:51.150
<v Speaker 1>and that same beer would cost you $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>boulevards.</v>

97
00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:55.980
<v Speaker 1>This has been happening in Venezuela </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistently for the last three years.</v>

98
00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:02.453
<v Speaker 1>This had the effect of destroying all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poverty reduction measures that </v>

99
00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Chavez had implemented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

100
00:06:06.661 --> 00:06:08.520
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it gets worse from here.</v>

101
00:06:08.521 --> 00:06:11.010
<v Speaker 1>Just when things were looking really </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible,</v>

102
00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:15.630
<v Speaker 1>but decided to demonstrate just how much</v>
<v Speaker 1>worse they can get.</v>

103
00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:17.853
<v Speaker 1>Youtube to finish with the price </v>
<v Speaker 1>increases will be the creation of the </v>

104
00:06:22.141 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 1>maximum sales brides.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neil Matsumoto.</v>

105
00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.723
<v Speaker 1>According to Missouri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hyperinflation was caused by those </v>

106
00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>evil capitalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to destroy Venezuela.</v>

107
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.770
<v Speaker 1>So the logical solution of course was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fight them.</v>

108
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.813
<v Speaker 1>So you're probably wondering right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly the outcome of all of this </v>

109
00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:39.691
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:06:39.691 --> 00:06:40.524
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that you own butcher shop </v>

111
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:46.840
<v Speaker 1>in the beautiful city of Maricado.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You believe meat from a Colombian farmer</v>

112
00:06:46.841 --> 00:06:49.180
<v Speaker 1>and you pay with US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

113
00:06:49.181 --> 00:06:50.014
<v Speaker 1>let's say the pounds of beef costs you </v>
<v Speaker 1>$10 for Venezuelan central bank has an </v>

114
00:06:53.711 --> 00:06:57.580
<v Speaker 1>official exchange rate of 10 boulevard </v>
<v Speaker 1>store one US dollar,</v>

115
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:58.443
<v Speaker 1>but no one's going to sell you dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>at that price because the market price </v>

116
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:01.924
<v Speaker 1>is way higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that if he wants to buy beef </v>

117
00:07:04.151 --> 00:07:04.984
<v Speaker 1>from your Colombian producer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to have to pay the price </v>

118
00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:11.260
<v Speaker 1>set by the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the equivalent of 10,000</v>

119
00:07:11.261 --> 00:07:12.420
<v Speaker 1>Bolivares per 10,</v>

120
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.833
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

121
00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:18.383
<v Speaker 1>It's fine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you go back to your shop and </v>

122
00:07:19.231 --> 00:07:21.960
<v Speaker 1>you want to sell this pounds of beef </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you bought,</v>

123
00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:22.943
<v Speaker 1>but then he find out that the government</v>
<v Speaker 1>has set a maximum sale price of a </v>

124
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.803
<v Speaker 1>thousand boulevards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 10 times less than what you </v>

125
00:07:28.171 --> 00:07:30.150
<v Speaker 1>paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you've got two options.</v>

126
00:07:30.210 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 1>You can close up your shop or to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>your meat on the black market.</v>

127
00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:38.280
<v Speaker 1>Now some of you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do they have to buy foreign name?</v>

128
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:41.220
<v Speaker 1>Why can't they just buy meat that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>made inside Venezuela?</v>

129
00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.770
<v Speaker 1>The answer is that whatever product you </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy it,</v>

130
00:07:43.771 --> 00:07:44.604
<v Speaker 1>it's going to require something that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>made outside of the country that you </v>

131
00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:49.320
<v Speaker 1>bought the product in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

132
00:07:49.321 --> 00:07:50.154
<v Speaker 1>if you want to grow weeds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to need a tractor which is </v>

133
00:07:51.871 --> 00:07:52.704
<v Speaker 1>manufactured somewhere else and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might find that even the seeds or the </v>

134
00:07:54.601 --> 00:07:58.560
<v Speaker 1>fertilizer also need in a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>country one way or another.</v>

135
00:07:58.561 --> 00:07:59.394
<v Speaker 1>There is no country on earth that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>capable of producing all that they </v>

136
00:08:01.951 --> 00:08:04.470
<v Speaker 1>consume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even the United States.</v>

137
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.393
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't forget now that Venezuela </v>

138
00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:09.450
<v Speaker 1>based their entire economy on the export</v>
<v Speaker 1>of oil,</v>

139
00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:12.870
<v Speaker 1>and so dave still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not going so well.</v>

140
00:08:12.990 --> 00:08:13.823
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan oil has become so expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they'd rather buy it from external </v>

141
00:08:17.431 --> 00:08:19.610
<v Speaker 1>sources than even use their own</v>

142
00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.510
<v Speaker 1>be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The BSA has lounge,</v>

143
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:30.511
<v Speaker 1>one of it's largest oil tenders ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeking to buy some 8 million barrels of</v>

144
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 1>us or Nigerian light crude for delivery </v>
<v Speaker 1>from April through June.</v>

145
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:36.363
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned previously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan oil is really expensive to </v>

146
00:08:38.711 --> 00:08:39.544
<v Speaker 1>produce and it turns out that they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>just rolled the blind from other </v>

147
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:43.810
<v Speaker 1>countries that use their own oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

148
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.673
<v Speaker 1>shops cannot import goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is leading to a scarcity of toilet </v>

149
00:08:47.141 --> 00:08:47.974
<v Speaker 1>paper and there's even lead to </v>
<v Speaker 1>situations where people have stabbed </v>

150
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:52.770
<v Speaker 1>each other over a small piece of.</v>

151
00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

152
00:08:59.210 --> 00:09:01.570
<v Speaker 1>so now that we've given you the rundown </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Venezuela,</v>

153
00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:04.140

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.500
<v Speaker 1>we'll be able to pull this country out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of collapse.</v>

155
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:09.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you see there's an alternative for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to pursue?</v>
