<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

<v Speaker 1>this is South Africa or a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>situated in the extreme south of </v>

00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>average.</v>

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:24.413
<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.663
<v Speaker 1>It's not a small country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's surface area is laundry than </v>

<v Speaker 1>Belgium,</v>

11
00:00:30.301 --> 00:00:31.134
<v Speaker 1>and the Netherlands combined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is by far the most developed economy </v>

12
00:00:34.351 --> 00:00:37.500
<v Speaker 1>of all the countries situated south of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sahara desert.</v>

13
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:38.393
<v Speaker 1>In the year 2010 it was the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>African country to holds a soccer world </v>

14
00:00:42.091 --> 00:00:42.924
<v Speaker 1>championship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the summer of [inaudible] Waka </v>

15
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.480
<v Speaker 1>Waka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone cast around then?</v>

16
00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.413
<v Speaker 2>The box</v>

18
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.340
<v Speaker 1>pours in month in South Africa's history</v>
<v Speaker 1>was April,</v>

19
00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:57.680
<v Speaker 1>1994 between the 26th and 29th of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>

20
00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.140
<v Speaker 1>South Africa celebrated the first free </v>
<v Speaker 1>universal ends,</v>

21
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 1>democratic elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were all seeing the longest because</v>

22
00:01:04.161 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>the election's lasted for four long </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

23
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:07.393
<v Speaker 1>During that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africans left the house as </v>

24
00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:09.734
<v Speaker 1>massively devote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having to wait in queues at kilometers </v>

25
00:01:11.991 --> 00:01:12.824
<v Speaker 1>long</v>

26
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.463
<v Speaker 2>ahead</v>

27
00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:17.663
<v Speaker 1>was justified for these elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Men to the ends of 300 years of </v>

28
00:01:20.791 --> 00:01:21.624
<v Speaker 1>colonialism and white supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The elections mark to the end of </v>

29
00:01:24.481 --> 00:01:25.314
<v Speaker 1>apartheid.</v>

30
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.073
<v Speaker 2>Apartheid</v>

31
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.080
<v Speaker 1>was this system based on racial </v>
<v Speaker 1>segregation,</v>

32
00:01:34.081 --> 00:01:34.914
<v Speaker 1>which remains in effect for 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It mainly consisted of separating the </v>

33
00:01:38.281 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>whites population from the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>

34
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.960
<v Speaker 1>This applies in any situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>living,</v>

35
00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:45.300
<v Speaker 1>studying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the spending of leisure time.</v>

36
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

37
00:01:46.801 --> 00:01:47.634
<v Speaker 1>all of the best areas and services were </v>
<v Speaker 1>built for bands used by the white </v>

38
00:01:50.491 --> 00:01:51.324
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A good example of this was the </v>

39
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:53.094
<v Speaker 1>ambulances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though the black population where </v>

40
00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>80% of the population they barely had </v>
<v Speaker 1>any ambulances to use.</v>

41
00:01:58.651 --> 00:01:59.484
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ambulances for the white population </v>

42
00:02:00.751 --> 00:02:01.584
<v Speaker 1>were numerous and refused to carry any </v>
<v Speaker 1>black passengers because they couldn't </v>

43
00:02:04.411 --> 00:02:05.430
<v Speaker 1>see according to the law.</v>

44
00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

45
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.973
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] gave the white population </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the political power and also </v>

46
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:19.334
<v Speaker 1>established many limitations precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to consolidate that white </v>

47
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:23.720
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>

48
00:02:23.721 --> 00:02:26.830
<v Speaker 1>mixed race relationships and marriage </v>
<v Speaker 1>work and for business.</v>

49
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.703
<v Speaker 1>Quite simply,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it left the black population in an </v>

50
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:29.864
<v Speaker 1>inhumane</v>

51
00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:33.603
<v Speaker 2>be</v>

52
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.760
<v Speaker 1>said that there were two different South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa's one black and terribly poor and</v>

53
00:02:39.761 --> 00:02:40.594
<v Speaker 1>the other white,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very wealthy and of course </v>

54
00:02:42.071 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>those who rebels itself at a terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishments and repression.</v>

55
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.970
<v Speaker 1>On the 16th of June,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1976 thousands of black students went on</v>

56
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:52.900
<v Speaker 1>the demonstration to demand social and </v>
<v Speaker 1>educative improvements.</v>

57
00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of them were massacred.</v>

58
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.100
<v Speaker 2>I got into Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have this guy in my bag.</v>

59
00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.353
<v Speaker 2>I was running over the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they dumped that just writing away from </v>

60
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:07.351
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from the police dream,</v>

61
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.800
<v Speaker 1>but all that changed in 1994 thanks for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nelson Mandela,</v>

62
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.693
<v Speaker 1>also known as Madiba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was considered the father of the </v>

63
00:03:17.101 --> 00:03:17.934
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela led the political fight against </v>

64
00:03:21.001 --> 00:03:22.700
<v Speaker 1>apartheid and racism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God's,</v>

65
00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:23.534
<v Speaker 1>he had to pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1961 he was sentenced to life </v>

66
00:03:25.831 --> 00:03:26.664
<v Speaker 1>imprisonment for the trail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela spent 27 years in jail until </v>

67
00:03:30.331 --> 00:03:31.164
<v Speaker 1>1992 nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two years after it was released in 1994 </v>

68
00:03:34.291 --> 00:03:36.210
<v Speaker 1>during the country's first free </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections,</v>

69
00:03:36.211 --> 00:03:38.520
<v Speaker 1>he was elected as the president of South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

70
00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 1>the first black president in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's history.</v>

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.203
<v Speaker 1>Often this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many were surprised to see Mandela </v>

72
00:03:46.741 --> 00:03:47.574
<v Speaker 1>aiming for reconciliation rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenge and Della Dreamt of a free your </v>

73
00:03:50.931 --> 00:03:52.980
<v Speaker 1>90 days and it's prosperous South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

74
00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>He made it clear in his inaugural </v>
<v Speaker 1>speech,</v>

75
00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 3>we have time and I thought the implant </v>
<v Speaker 3>hoping the on the Miller of Rp,</v>

76
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.083
<v Speaker 3>we have dry into our covenant that wish </v>
<v Speaker 3>I healed the society in which all South </v>

77
00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Africa can I can.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why wouldn't be able to walk,</v>

78
00:04:08.501 --> 00:04:11.710
<v Speaker 3>talk without tenure?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Fear in their hearts.</v>

79
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.063
<v Speaker 3>I saw off the hype of human dignity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Grain partners at peace with itself and </v>

80
00:04:19.061 --> 00:04:19.620
<v Speaker 3>the wealth.</v>

81
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:20.453
<v Speaker 1>Mandela caps is worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He works towards the United South </v>

82
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's when the time came,</v>

83
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.790
<v Speaker 1>he left power following the limits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution.</v>

84
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.620
<v Speaker 1>This all turns him into a legend</v>

85
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.280
<v Speaker 4>country.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What does Rebecca for Bay?</v>

86
00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.800
<v Speaker 4>The past is the past.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We look to the future now.</v>

87
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's now focus on present day South </v>

88
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.660
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is the only country in the world's to</v>

89
00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:43.730
<v Speaker 1>have three capital cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cape Town,</v>

90
00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.593
<v Speaker 1>the capital city for legislative power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretoria for executive power and it's </v>

91
00:04:47.511 --> 00:04:50.890
<v Speaker 1>blue fontane feed judicial capitol city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all that,</v>

92
00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.793
<v Speaker 1>neither is the most populated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the one where most businesses </v>

93
00:04:54.441 --> 00:04:55.274
<v Speaker 1>concentrates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For that we have to move to a fourth </v>

94
00:04:56.871 --> 00:04:57.704
<v Speaker 1>city Johannesburg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's even not uncommon for different </v>

95
00:05:01.611 --> 00:05:05.240
<v Speaker 1>textbooks to stay to different cities as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capital of South Africa.</v>

96
00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.133
<v Speaker 1>Now after the fall of apartheid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa experienced quite an </v>

97
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>economic boost since 1994 the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering purchasing power has it</v>

98
00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:18.830
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He</v>

99
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.613
<v Speaker 1>has been strongly reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ends a hundreds of thousands of black </v>

100
00:05:22.901 --> 00:05:26.050
<v Speaker 1>families make it into the middle class </v>
<v Speaker 1>every single year.</v>

101
00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:26.943
<v Speaker 1>I even Lou violence is still high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't need to be said that South </v>

102
00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:30.753
<v Speaker 1>Africa is quite a violent country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has also been reduced further in </v>

103
00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the access to drinkable water,</v>

104
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>electricity and healthcare has also </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved quite a lot.</v>

105
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.203
<v Speaker 1>Do you illustrate the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa is the biggest tourist </v>

106
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 1>center and its financial power in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>south of the continent.</v>

107
00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 1>It stock market is the most important in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

108
00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>I did is also an important place for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>automotive industry.</v>

109
00:05:50.141 --> 00:05:53.440
<v Speaker 1>Companies such as BMW and General Motors</v>
<v Speaker 1>have factories out.</v>

110
00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 1>So it all sounds pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:05:55.930 --> 00:06:00.930
<v Speaker 1>Well things today are not looking that </v>
<v Speaker 1>rosie crises on stagnation,</v>

112
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.493
<v Speaker 1>just licensed numerous achievements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy hasn't changed since 2009 </v>

113
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 1>the economy isn't growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment rates,</v>

114
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:11.150
<v Speaker 1>I'll one of the highest in the world and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

115
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:12.920
<v Speaker 1>very few people are working the country.</v>

116
00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:15.500
<v Speaker 1>It has a population of about 55 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

117
00:06:15.501 --> 00:06:16.334
<v Speaker 1>50 million of which are without work and</v>
<v Speaker 1>as many of the jobs that the people do </v>

118
00:06:19.041 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our informal,</v>

119
00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:21.103
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the only problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investment by companies has also kept a </v>

120
00:06:24.561 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>decreasing in the last nine years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's currency.</v>

121
00:06:26.721 --> 00:06:27.554
<v Speaker 1>The rand is also greatly depreciate it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's public debt is about to be </v>

122
00:06:30.111 --> 00:06:30.944
<v Speaker 1>declared as junk bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty major economic </v>

123
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

124
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:37.790
<v Speaker 1>in the last years people with money have</v>
<v Speaker 1>begun leaving the country.</v>

125
00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.700
<v Speaker 1>So the big question is what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa?</v>

126
00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 1>What led to this crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Jacob Zuma.</v>

127
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:52.610
<v Speaker 1>He's been in office since 2009 and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>years in office have been,</v>

128
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:54.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been a giant mess.</v>

129
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.113
<v Speaker 1>My man is facing at 783 corruption cases</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he has been described at being a </v>

130
00:06:59.601 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>professional ads taking things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>not his</v>

131
00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:03.313
<v Speaker 5>South Africa's main opposition party is </v>
<v Speaker 5>accusing President Jacob Zuma or of </v>

132
00:07:07.651 --> 00:07:11.600
<v Speaker 5>flagrant abuse of public money is a </v>
<v Speaker 5>multimillion euro.</v>

133
00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:12.463
<v Speaker 5>Upgrades to his home.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Additions to zoomers home include a </v>

134
00:07:15.351 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 5>swimming pool,</v>
<v Speaker 5>cattle enclosure and an amphitheater.</v>

135
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.023
<v Speaker 1>This is not the only issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Zoom is political decisions don't </v>

136
00:07:22.971 --> 00:07:23.804
<v Speaker 1>encourage foreign investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further the president's labor </v>

137
00:07:25.701 --> 00:07:26.534
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are an obstacle when it comes to </v>

138
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:28.364
<v Speaker 1>job creation and the regulations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting more and more rigid has last </v>

139
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.380
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge raise in the minimum wage.</v>

140
00:07:33.381 --> 00:07:36.560
<v Speaker 1>It's something that doesn't make a bunch</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sense in a country where there are so</v>

141
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>few working people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

142
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:39.083
<v Speaker 1>many financial analysts have criticized </v>
<v Speaker 1>the measure by saying it's nonsensical </v>

143
00:07:42.111 --> 00:07:42.944
<v Speaker 1>to establish a minimum wage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which amounts do twice as much as half </v>

144
00:07:45.531 --> 00:07:46.730
<v Speaker 1>of work as I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

145
00:07:46.731 --> 00:07:49.160
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all do once our salaries to raise,</v>

146
00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.023
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's a better idea to create</v>
<v Speaker 1>some wealth first if job creation was </v>

147
00:07:53.481 --> 00:07:54.314
<v Speaker 1>already an issue before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine what's going to happen with </v>

148
00:07:56.451 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 1>higher salaries and South Africa has </v>
<v Speaker 1>other problems too and important.</v>

149
00:08:00.081 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>One is it's problematic education</v>

150
00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:02.843
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>

151
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:08.613
<v Speaker 1>an awful education system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The education system in South Africa is </v>

152
00:08:13.571 --> 00:08:16.630
<v Speaker 1>pretty awful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Picture this one in every three students</v>

153
00:08:16.631 --> 00:08:17.464
<v Speaker 1>who has attended school for six years </v>
<v Speaker 1>has difficulty when it comes to </v>

154
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:20.554
<v Speaker 1>something as essential as reading and </v>
<v Speaker 1>only one in every 100 black students </v>

155
00:08:24.251 --> 00:08:26.680
<v Speaker 1>gets an engineering diploma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we can probably,</v>

156
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:27.514
<v Speaker 1>no one understands why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National companies complain about the </v>

157
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.680
<v Speaker 1>difficulty of finding skilled labor and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this has got nothing to do with money.</v>

158
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:33.543
<v Speaker 1>South Africa is one of the countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the highest investments in </v>

159
00:08:35.441 --> 00:08:36.460
<v Speaker 1>education in the world.</v>

160
00:08:42.050 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is happening?</v>

161
00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to some people,</v>

162
00:08:45.171 --> 00:08:48.140
<v Speaker 1>the ones who are to blame are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Teacher's Union.</v>

163
00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>They control the state education system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it has become something of a Mafia.</v>

164
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:54.530
<v Speaker 1>The union is an ally of President Zuma </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zuma.</v>

165
00:08:54.531 --> 00:08:56.850
<v Speaker 1>Besides putting it into education </v>
<v Speaker 1>supervision,</v>

166
00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.030
<v Speaker 1>there's also pulls many strings to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>more teachers into the system.</v>

167
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.923
<v Speaker 1>This is because the education level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>teachers themselves to become a very </v>

168
00:09:03.391 --> 00:09:03.931
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

169
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:06.420
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maths teachers in the country were given</v>

170
00:09:06.421 --> 00:09:07.254
<v Speaker 1>a task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These teachers were teaching math to 11 </v>

171
00:09:08.911 --> 00:09:10.620
<v Speaker 1>and 12 year olds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the result?</v>

172
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:11.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight hours of these teachers got lower </v>

173
00:09:12.841 --> 00:09:13.674
<v Speaker 1>results and we're expected of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>students and to be honest in maths is </v>

174
00:09:17.371 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>not exactly one of president zoom as </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong suits.</v>

175
00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:25.580
<v Speaker 1>This is President Zuma attempting to say</v>
<v Speaker 1>769,817</v>

176
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.720
<v Speaker 6>769 800 ten seven hundred one property,</v>
<v Speaker 6>810 20</v>

177
00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:38.953
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

178
00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>via sneak the results for white </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

179
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.070
<v Speaker 1>So you go to private schools are far </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

180
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:46.460
<v Speaker 1>This shows that maybe some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartheid heritage is still very much in</v>

181
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.294
<v Speaker 1>a fact</v>

182
00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:50.750
<v Speaker 2>race.</v>

183
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So conflict if these problems weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad enough.</v>

184
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:58.070
<v Speaker 1>Racial conflict in South Africa has also</v>
<v Speaker 1>been growing in the last few years.</v>

185
00:09:58.130 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 1>The economic freedom fighters is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical political party that was founded</v>

186
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:05.990
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 this party is an lv third </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest force in the country.</v>

187
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.180
<v Speaker 1>Some of its members are suggesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost inverted apartheid and plants and</v>

188
00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:12.530
<v Speaker 1>the white population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is still a minority party,</v>

189
00:10:12.531 --> 00:10:15.200
<v Speaker 1>but is an element of subversion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is working quite well.</v>

190
00:10:15.201 --> 00:10:17.600
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it now it looks as if Mandela's dream,</v>

191
00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:18.583
<v Speaker 1>it's now in danger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this is what we think here of Israel </v>

192
00:10:20.271 --> 00:10:21.470
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what do you think,</v>

193
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.333
<v Speaker 1>do you think the South Africa will </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to pursue Nelson Mandela's </v>

194
00:10:24.501 --> 00:10:25.334
<v Speaker 1>dream?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it will become the most </v>

195
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:28.040
<v Speaker 1>prosperous nation in Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

196
00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.000
<v Speaker 1>what'd you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hatred,</v>

197
00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>distrust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bad politics.</v>

198
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:31.364
<v Speaker 1>We'll try and do.</v>
