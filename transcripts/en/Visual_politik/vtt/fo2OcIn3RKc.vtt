00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.220
<v Speaker 1>In June of 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a single barrel of oil cost $114.</v>

2
00:00:13.411 --> 00:00:14.244
<v Speaker 1>Today the price is just $50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This drop is far beyond the usual </v>

3
00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:21.120
<v Speaker 1>fluctuations of price of this raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>material and it's beyond the predictions</v>

4
00:00:21.121 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>of pessimistic defenders of the peak oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>theory,</v>

5
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.593
<v Speaker 1>the theory that we are about to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>severe shortage because petroleum is </v>

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.630
<v Speaker 1>always running out more when the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there are many different factors</v>

7
00:00:35.161 --> 00:00:35.994
<v Speaker 1>that suggest that the price of petroleum</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to remain low for quite some </v>

8
00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:42.090
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is mainly due to two reasons.</v>

9
00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.540
<v Speaker 1>The first is the constant improvements </v>
<v Speaker 1>of energy efficiency,</v>

10
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.360
<v Speaker 1>meaning that we have a lesser need for </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>

11
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.720
<v Speaker 1>This is logical when you think that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>group of OACD countries,</v>

12
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.583
<v Speaker 1>that's the world's wealthiest countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>are using the same amounts of primary </v>

13
00:00:55.471 --> 00:01:00.471
<v Speaker 1>energy as they used in the year 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are producing 30 percent more.</v>

14
00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.550
<v Speaker 1>For us is the biggest market with 40,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>plugin cars purchased there in the first</v>

15
00:01:05.551 --> 00:01:06.384
<v Speaker 1>six months of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second reason is innovation and </v>

16
00:01:08.431 --> 00:01:12.390
<v Speaker 1>technological development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a field of expertise that is inherent to</v>

17
00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:13.224
<v Speaker 1>human evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a development that has occurred </v>

18
00:01:15.031 --> 00:01:15.864
<v Speaker 1>on two fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both fossil fuels as well as renewable </v>

19
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:19.443
<v Speaker 1>energies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best example of this might be </v>

20
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.433
<v Speaker 1>fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a technology that has provided </v>

21
00:01:24.241 --> 00:01:27.510
<v Speaker 1>the wells with a large amount of oil as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as natural gas.</v>

22
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.240
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this technology alone has led to the u s</v>

23
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.860
<v Speaker 1>doubling its oil production and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently that country is producing more</v>

24
00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:36.660
<v Speaker 1>oil than it has since the 19 seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

25
00:01:36.661 --> 00:01:37.494
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ecological impacts of fracking is a </v>

26
00:01:39.541 --> 00:01:40.374
<v Speaker 1>highly controversial topic that that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something we're going to address in a </v>

27
00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:43.560
<v Speaker 1>later video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

28
00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.394
<v Speaker 1>the reduced price of oil has been an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredible sense back for Persian Gulf </v>

29
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:52.131
<v Speaker 1>countries where 85 percent of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue relies on this until now.</v>

30
00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.510
<v Speaker 1>This has allowed for the payments of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of bills.</v>

31
00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:59.403
<v Speaker 1>Citizens of got use to high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies and allowances while also </v>

32
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>getting used to not having to pay any </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes to subsidize everything.</v>

33
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 1>Water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>

34
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:09.670
<v Speaker 1>fuel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low interest loans,</v>

35
00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.533
<v Speaker 1>and citizens have also got used to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea that they have a right to a well </v>

36
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:14.820
<v Speaker 1>paid civil service</v>

37
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.773
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

38
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.873
<v Speaker 1>More countries in the Persian Gulf of </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten used to spending an enormous </v>

39
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:25.890
<v Speaker 1>amounts of money on guns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.210
<v Speaker 1>they've spent so much money on weaponry </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Saudi Arabia now spends more on its</v>

41
00:02:30.211 --> 00:02:34.380
<v Speaker 1>military than Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes it the country with the third</v>

42
00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.700
<v Speaker 1>largest military budget globally.</v>

43
00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.460
<v Speaker 2>We all</v>

44
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.120
<v Speaker 1>know that oil money has paid for pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic campaigns all around the world.</v>

45
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.013
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these preexisting policies have become </v>

46
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:53.180
<v Speaker 1>completely unsustainable due to the drop</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the price of oil.</v>

47
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.133
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 alone oil producing countries </v>

48
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 1>last $360,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in oil revenues.</v>

49
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

50
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.770
<v Speaker 1>and this is all because of the harder </v>
<v Speaker 1>drop in the price of oil.</v>

51
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do still get an enormous amounts of</v>

52
00:03:10.981 --> 00:03:12.990
<v Speaker 1>money from oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

53
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.870
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against around $5,500</v>

54
00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:19.340
<v Speaker 1>per capita from it's black gold mounted </v>
<v Speaker 1>display link,</v>

55
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.060
<v Speaker 1>this still significant amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>income.</v>

56
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.973
<v Speaker 1>They are able to maintain all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies that they have established </v>

57
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.883
<v Speaker 1>because of this changing scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all countries in the Persian Gulf are </v>

58
00:03:28.381 --> 00:03:32.070
<v Speaker 1>announcing ambitious plans to diversify </v>
<v Speaker 1>their economies.</v>

59
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.933
<v Speaker 1>This will allow them to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance from the economy's completely </v>

60
00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.810
<v Speaker 1>relying on oil they aren't looking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow do by his example,</v>

61
00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>which has been one of the only countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>do successfully transitioned away from a</v>

62
00:03:42.691 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 1>totally oil based economy in the last 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

63
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Because of this</v>

64
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.803
<v Speaker 1>diversification away from the emirates </v>
<v Speaker 1>is becoming a world leader in terms of </v>

65
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>poor ism trade and the stick.</v>

66
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.213
<v Speaker 1>Tens of billions of dollars are being </v>
<v Speaker 1>invested into Qatar with the hope that </v>

67
00:04:10.611 --> 00:04:11.444
<v Speaker 1>it will become an economy of knowledge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They proudly show off their education </v>

68
00:04:15.051 --> 00:04:18.260
<v Speaker 1>city development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge educational complex where some of</v>

69
00:04:18.261 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 1>the most prestigious schools in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wells can be found.</v>

70
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:22.153
<v Speaker 1>There are also notable researchers </v>
<v Speaker 1>working there with budgets that seem </v>

71
00:04:24.951 --> 00:04:26.690
<v Speaker 1>almost infinite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

72
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.870
<v Speaker 1>the most archetypical case is the one we</v>
<v Speaker 1>find in Saudi Arabia,</v>

73
00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.350
<v Speaker 1>one of the world's most suffocating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying countries.</v>

74
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Human Rights in Saudi Arabia are nothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than an illusion.</v>

75
00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.090
<v Speaker 1>Women are forced to marry under rage and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can't even drive further.</v>

76
00:04:41.091 --> 00:04:41.924
<v Speaker 1>Dozens of executions occur every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and torture is quite routine lasts for </v>

77
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.250
<v Speaker 1>me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homosexual acts,</v>

78
00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:48.590
<v Speaker 1>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treason and murder,</v>

79
00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:53.450
<v Speaker 1>a punishable by death through beheading </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Saudi Arabia and the Islamic state.</v>

80
00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country has even banned theaters and</v>

81
00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.983
<v Speaker 1>nightclubs in Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Religion and fundamentalism are more </v>

82
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.180
<v Speaker 1>important than anything else.</v>

83
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.650
<v Speaker 1>Last economic crisis cannot be escaped </v>
<v Speaker 1>and today they are facing a very complex</v>

84
00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.180
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2015,</v>

85
00:05:14.181 --> 00:05:19.181
<v Speaker 1>the deficit was at 15 percent of the GDP</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this continued into 2016.</v>

86
00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:20.083
<v Speaker 1>This is threatening to swallow up all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the money that they saved during the </v>

87
00:05:22.971 --> 00:05:24.770
<v Speaker 1>black gold of years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

88
00:05:24.771 --> 00:05:25.604
<v Speaker 1>unemployment is becoming a major concern</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is no more true than among </v>

89
00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:29.803
<v Speaker 1>young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unemployment rate is currently </v>

90
00:05:31.341 --> 00:05:34.190
<v Speaker 1>sitting for young people at around 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

91
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.460
<v Speaker 1>This is why in April 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prince Mohammed,</v>

92
00:05:37.461 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 1>Bill Sahlman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strongest man in the kingdom,</v>

93
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:44.060
<v Speaker 1>announced an ambitious reform plan known</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Saudi Vision Twenty,</v>

94
00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:44.933
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal of this reform plan is nothing </v>

95
00:05:46.791 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 1>less than do transform the country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

96
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.571
<v Speaker 3>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>look,</v>

97
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:51.404
<v Speaker 3>this is a good plan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We need to diversify our way because of </v>

98
00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 3>necessity.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Otherwise the country will have far more</v>

99
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 3>difficulties in the years to come.</v>

100
00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.700
<v Speaker 1>The plan aims to achieve total </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence from oil by 20 slash 20 and</v>

101
00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:07.840
<v Speaker 1>become one of the most globally </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive economy is by 20,</v>

102
00:06:07.841 --> 00:06:08.674
<v Speaker 1>30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first step of this stance by </v>

103
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.223
<v Speaker 1>privatizing Aramco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the world's largest </v>

104
00:06:13.811 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Speaker 1>companies which controls 10 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>global oil production.</v>

105
00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:18.483
<v Speaker 1>The company's estimated value is five </v>
<v Speaker 1>times that of apple with all the money </v>

106
00:06:22.181 --> 00:06:23.620
<v Speaker 1>from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Privatization,</v>

107
00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.550
<v Speaker 1>addition of foreign reserves of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>privatization of public companies,</v>

108
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.443
<v Speaker 1>and it's real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia wants to generate a </v>

109
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:33.100
<v Speaker 1>sovereign wealth funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have $2,000,000,000,000</v>

110
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:39.813
<v Speaker 1>tell them to get a more predictable and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable income than they are currently </v>

111
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>getting from oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will see once you eliminate many of</v>

112
00:06:44.951 --> 00:06:45.784
<v Speaker 1>the subsidies that are currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatening their economy and to invest </v>

113
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.320
<v Speaker 1>in new sectors like mining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>

114
00:06:50.321 --> 00:06:52.450
<v Speaker 1>and importantly the military industry.</v>

115
00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.493
<v Speaker 4>Uber is getting a three and a half a </v>
<v Speaker 4>billion dollar investment from Saudi </v>

116
00:06:58.280 --> 00:06:59.510
<v Speaker 4>Arabia's public investment fund.</v>

117
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:00.533
<v Speaker 1>New taxes are also going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>introduced as another method of earning </v>

118
00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:03.834
<v Speaker 1>for the governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prince still wants to change the </v>

119
00:07:05.161 --> 00:07:05.994
<v Speaker 1>higher educational system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is currently closer to the Koran </v>

120
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:11.250
<v Speaker 1>and develop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to meet modern market requirements,</v>

121
00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:16.310
<v Speaker 1>but the big question has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Saudi Arabia going to succeed?</v>

122
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:17.993
<v Speaker 1>It is no easy task for a country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly become an industrial power and </v>

123
00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:22.314
<v Speaker 1>it is unlikely that tourists are going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be drawn to a country which sees </v>

124
00:07:24.961 --> 00:07:28.710
<v Speaker 1>people regularly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stones for homosexuality or adultery.</v>

125
00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:29.940
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that said,</v>

126
00:07:29.941 --> 00:07:30.774
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia success will benefit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wells no matter how repulsive we </v>

127
00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:34.584
<v Speaker 1>personally find that policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent of the Saudi population </v>

128
00:07:37.591 --> 00:07:38.424
<v Speaker 1>is under 30 years old and over the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years they're going to require 2 </v>

129
00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:43.583
<v Speaker 1>million jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know that when frustration </v>

130
00:07:45.301 --> 00:07:48.150
<v Speaker 1>unemployment's ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious fundamentalism add up.</v>

131
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 1>The consequences can be truly dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Bonnie has proved that moderation</v>

132
00:07:53.821 --> 00:07:57.360
<v Speaker 1>and capitalism can lead to changes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalist regimes.</v>

133
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.710
<v Speaker 1>We can only hope that Saudi Arabia can </v>
<v Speaker 1>successfully follow the example that has</v>

134
00:08:01.711 --> 00:08:02.544
<v Speaker 1>been set by Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is our opinion here at visual </v>

135
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:06.540
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to know what you think.</v>

136
00:08:06.541 --> 00:08:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Saudi Arabia will succeed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it will successfully follow</v>

137
00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:11.364
<v Speaker 1>the example that has been set by Dubai?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that capitalism can </v>

138
00:08:14.671 --> 00:08:17.640
<v Speaker 1>encourage moderation in countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia?</v>
