1
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.710
<v Speaker 1>We wanted flying cars instead of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we got 140 characters with these words.</v>

2
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.544
<v Speaker 1>Peter Thiel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous Silicon Valley investor who </v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:17.570
<v Speaker 1>we've talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>joins the legions of people.</v>

4
00:00:17.571 --> 00:00:20.990
<v Speaker 1>You consider that innovation in the past</v>
<v Speaker 1>few years has slowed down somewhat,</v>

5
00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.853
<v Speaker 1>although most of the time of great </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary inventions seems to have </v>

6
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:25.550
<v Speaker 1>been left behind.</v>

7
00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:35.350
<v Speaker 2>Who else could have done it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Start Trek,</v>

8
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 2>Christy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So competent.</v>

9
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things on that.</v>

10
00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.963
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

11
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.433
<v Speaker 1>Example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this slowdown can be found in the </v>

12
00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:45.713
<v Speaker 1>automobile industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an industry that has been pretty static </v>

13
00:00:47.971 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

14
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>cars nowadays are better than 10 to 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>

15
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 1>that's for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are basically the same and they</v>

16
00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 1>launch any work in the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.253
<v Speaker 1>there is nothing substantial that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do with a car today that you </v>

18
00:01:00.301 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>couldn't do 20 or 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course cars still don't fly.</v>

19
00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Maybe we present the top 95 you on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you being,</v>

20
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.753
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

21
00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.300
<v Speaker 2>Sierra Alpha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bravo.</v>

22
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:31.590
<v Speaker 1>I'm Wendy was talking about a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry here,</v>

23
00:01:31.591 --> 00:01:34.110
<v Speaker 1>but one of the biggest industries in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

24
00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.771
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do,</v>

25
00:01:34.771 --> 00:01:37.950
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second here because everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests that finally,</v>

26
00:01:37.951 --> 00:01:41.620
<v Speaker 1>we are on the verge of a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution in the realm of cars or trans</v>

27
00:01:41.621 --> 00:01:42.454
<v Speaker 1>formation that many experts have </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to the one in the early 20th </v>

28
00:01:45.301 --> 00:01:46.134
<v Speaker 1>century that was engineered by Henry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford where he began to use assembly </v>

29
00:01:48.871 --> 00:01:50.850
<v Speaker 1>lines to mass produce cars.</v>

30
00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:58.150
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

31
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.160
<v Speaker 1>Make this new revolution seems to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>two key features,</v>

32
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.210
<v Speaker 1>the electric car and the autonomous car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And here we have an unquestionable star,</v>

33
00:02:06.211 --> 00:02:10.130
<v Speaker 1>a company that isn't managed to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing things and knows how to win the</v>

34
00:02:10.131 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>admiration of the many people who see us</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an example of a new era that is about</v>

35
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:17.300
<v Speaker 1>to begin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are of course talking about Tesla.</v>

36
00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.143
<v Speaker 1>The company have electric cars that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to dazzle investors as well as </v>

37
00:02:21.231 --> 00:02:22.064
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that in this video we are going to </v>

38
00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:31.470
<v Speaker 1>see you what kind of challenges Tesla is</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to face in the coming years.</v>

39
00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.930
<v Speaker 1>So let's dive in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

40
00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.400
<v Speaker 1>History of wine and roses.</v>

42
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:42.160
<v Speaker 2>That's</v>

43
00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.993
<v Speaker 1>what is a very young company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was born in 2003 with the mission of </v>

44
00:02:45.971 --> 00:02:46.804
<v Speaker 1>producing an electric car capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing and defeating combustion </v>

45
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:51.400
<v Speaker 1>engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

46
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.460
<v Speaker 1>it has managed to basically put on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market for models,</v>

47
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.200
<v Speaker 1>the Tesla roadster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model s,</v>

48
00:02:56.201 --> 00:02:57.940
<v Speaker 1>the model x hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the newcomer,</v>

49
00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
<v Speaker 1>the model three seems to be around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>few rights.</v>

50
00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:06.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite this,</v>

51
00:03:06.881 --> 00:03:09.940
<v Speaker 1>in 2010 the company went public and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what happens?</v>

52
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla,</v>

53
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>it's become one of the markets stars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these years.</v>

54
00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>The price of their shares has multiplied</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 18 yes.</v>

55
00:03:17.321 --> 00:03:20.170
<v Speaker 1>Just like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2010 if you had invested $1,000</v>

56
00:03:20.171 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>in Teslas shares today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would have $18,000</v>

57
00:03:23.561 --> 00:03:24.394
<v Speaker 1>a pretty amazing investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this growth has led tesla to fight </v>

58
00:03:27.011 --> 00:03:30.430
<v Speaker 1>for first place among the most valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in the United States.</v>

59
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.313
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

60
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 1>Time of publishing this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to buy us well,</v>

61
00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:41.870
<v Speaker 1>prepare your wallet because Tesla is </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth more than $50 billion.</v>

62
00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.600
<v Speaker 1>This is more than the value of forward,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

63
00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Amazon not that far off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Motors.</v>

64
00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Just have a look at this chart from </v>
<v Speaker 1>business insight.</v>

65
00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think not bad.</v>

66
00:03:57.541 --> 00:03:59.490
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially the case.</v>

67
00:03:59.491 --> 00:04:00.324
<v Speaker 1>If we take into account that it is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company that is barely 14 years old and </v>

68
00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:04.170
<v Speaker 1>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

69
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.150
<v Speaker 1>honestly doesn't sell that many cars.</v>

70
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.523
<v Speaker 2>Generally</v>

71
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.120
<v Speaker 1>it sells 10 million cars each year and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford exceeds 6 million,</v>

72
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.680
<v Speaker 1>but in 2016 Tesla managed to sell just </v>
<v Speaker 1>76,000</v>

73
00:04:16.681 --> 00:04:17.514
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

74
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:19.893
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

75
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.853
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you are probably thinking right </v>

76
00:04:21.551 --> 00:04:22.271
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:04:22.271 --> 00:04:25.330
<v Speaker 1>come on Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already sell luxury cars and yes,</v>

78
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still just 76,000</v>

79
00:04:28.391 --> 00:04:33.391
<v Speaker 1>cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is three times less than Paul is.</v>

80
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:37.754
<v Speaker 1>What explains why General Motors sales </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 we're almost $170 billion while </v>

81
00:04:42.171 --> 00:04:45.230
<v Speaker 1>tesla remains well below to just 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>

82
00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:45.300
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

83
00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.133
<v Speaker 2>Dollars.</v>

84
00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Do you know think that what is happening</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Tesla has very high margins and is </v>

85
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>earning a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

86
00:04:54.331 --> 00:04:55.260
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

87
00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 1>since the company was founded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not ends money in any single.</v>

88
00:04:58.741 --> 00:04:59.574
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

89
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>This point you're probably wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.900
<v Speaker 1>why then is it worth so much money on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the stock market?</v>

91
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Why has it been so successful there and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why indeed is this company so famous?</v>

92
00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.153
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

93
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.083
<v Speaker 1>We all answer to that is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company has a lot to do with a </v>

94
00:05:14.271 --> 00:05:15.104
<v Speaker 1>revolution that's happening in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry that we commented on before </v>

95
00:05:17.101 --> 00:05:17.934
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the introduction of electric and </v>

96
00:05:19.181 --> 00:05:20.014
<v Speaker 1>autonomous vehicles.</v>

97
00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.380
<v Speaker 2>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

98
00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 there were more than 2 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric cars on the road.</v>

99
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 1>60% is more than in the previous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

100
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:36.213
<v Speaker 1>That is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about markets that are </v>

101
00:05:37.721 --> 00:05:38.554
<v Speaker 1>growing incredibly quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further technological advances have cut </v>

102
00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:42.394
<v Speaker 1>the price of this type of car.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The forecast by Bloomberg new energy </v>

103
00:05:46.241 --> 00:05:47.074
<v Speaker 1>finance said that electric cars would </v>
<v Speaker 1>become cheaper than conventional cars </v>

104
00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>without government subsidies between </v>
<v Speaker 1>2025 and 2030 and is on the other hand,</v>

105
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:56.244
<v Speaker 1>in as many countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including China itself on betting on </v>

106
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.174
<v Speaker 1>this technology as a way to reduce air </v>
<v Speaker 1>pollution in cities tend to also as a </v>

107
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>way to reduce their dependence on </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign oil.</v>

108
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>It's not often that environment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>national security.</v>

109
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>It comes together in such a combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but here we are.</v>

110
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.853
<v Speaker 1>Does that today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla is the great reference points in </v>

111
00:06:21.171 --> 00:06:22.004
<v Speaker 1>this new industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many investors understand this and </v>

112
00:06:23.811 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>therefore value the future of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company highly.</v>

113
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:27.133
<v Speaker 1>The company's own forecasts falling at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same line and expects that </v>

114
00:06:29.211 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 1>production will increase from 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>cars in 2017 to 500,000</v>

115
00:06:33.951 --> 00:06:36.740
<v Speaker 1>in 2020 and more than a million by 2022</v>

116
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:37.623
<v Speaker 2>two</v>

117
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:39.793
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he seems like we're talking about the </v>

118
00:06:40.551 --> 00:06:42.710
<v Speaker 1>apple of the automotive sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

119
00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:43.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just wait a minute because not </v>

120
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:48.500
<v Speaker 1>everything that surrounds Tesla is quite</v>
<v Speaker 1>so great.</v>

121
00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.023
<v Speaker 2>Eight</v>

122
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>rusher of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla,</v>

123
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.400
<v Speaker 1>they have a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very serious problem indeed.</v>

124
00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Kassala in machine for burning money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

125
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.073
<v Speaker 1>you heard me correctly today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the business is not profitable than the </v>

126
00:07:07.331 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>company loses money every day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

127
00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:13.600
<v Speaker 1>it also has to make a lot of investments</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to compete.</v>

128
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:14.463
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its factories need pumping with loads </v>

129
00:07:16.661 --> 00:07:17.494
<v Speaker 1>and loads of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We look at the money that comes in and </v>

130
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.320
<v Speaker 1>out of the cash box at Tesla as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>already did with Amazon.</v>

131
00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:28.810
<v Speaker 1>We can say that from 2010 when it went </v>
<v Speaker 1>public,</v>

132
00:07:28.811 --> 00:07:31.470
<v Speaker 1>the company has it swallowed absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that is ends.</v>

133
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>It is the money from the car sales as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well is about $10 billion more.</v>

134
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

135
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:42.230
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that 2017 is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly Tesla's best year.</v>

136
00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:46.850
<v Speaker 1>In the first nine months of 2017 it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>swallowed about 4 billion.</v>

137
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really $4 billion in nine months and not</v>

138
00:07:53.251 --> 00:07:54.084
<v Speaker 1>only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's non financial </v>

139
00:07:55.771 --> 00:07:56.730
<v Speaker 1>debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

140
00:07:56.731 --> 00:07:59.850
<v Speaker 1>suppliers that have not been paid has </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely skyrocketed.</v>

141
00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:03.150
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights are beginning to flash red at the</v>

142
00:08:03.151 --> 00:08:04.680
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider this graph.</v>

143
00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last few months,</v>

144
00:08:12.841 --> 00:08:16.230
<v Speaker 1>Tesla has lost $60 million every single </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

145
00:08:16.260 --> 00:08:18.720
<v Speaker 1>Money of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's had to cover with debt,</v>

146
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.583
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't stop that audits all </v>
<v Speaker 1>testing or is also having many problems </v>

147
00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 1>with its latest model constantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>reveals.</v>

148
00:08:24.601 --> 00:08:29.601
<v Speaker 1>It just made 260 model three cars due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>production bottlenecks.</v>

149
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:32.820
<v Speaker 1>It also has quality problems and has </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismissed stuff,</v>

150
00:08:32.850 --> 00:08:33.683
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is a little bit weird </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they seem to need to be making a </v>

151
00:08:35.851 --> 00:08:39.600
<v Speaker 1>lot more cars rather than less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you want to see the car</v>

152
00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:45.580
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and</v>

153
00:08:49.420 --> 00:08:50.253
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well surely there's got to be the worst </v>

154
00:08:51.551 --> 00:08:52.110
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

155
00:08:52.110 --> 00:08:52.943
<v Speaker 1>Well just wait a minute because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst of it is that the competition is </v>

156
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.070
<v Speaker 1>moving really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>

157
00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.953
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Thousand and 16 the [inaudible] and </v>
<v Speaker 1>group sold more electric cars than Tesla</v>

159
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.160
<v Speaker 1>and pretty much all big companies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>already working on electric vehicles and</v>

160
00:09:11.161 --> 00:09:13.410
<v Speaker 1>autonomous cars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I business by the way,</v>

161
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>which companies such as apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google and uber are also getting into.</v>

162
00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>And that's some pretty serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

163
00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:20.790
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla is not,</v>

164
00:09:20.791 --> 00:09:22.260
<v Speaker 1>the only player at this</v>

165
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.173
<v Speaker 2>game</v>

166
00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:34.380
<v Speaker 1>is that almost all of its rivals is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually earned money and their research</v>

167
00:09:34.381 --> 00:09:37.470
<v Speaker 1>budgets at least as big as those at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla</v>

168
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:38.590
<v Speaker 2>dining</v>

169
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.423
<v Speaker 3>lyric.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Steel's Tesla's thunder with heavy duty </v>

170
00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:42.940
<v Speaker 3>electric truck.</v>

171
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:43.963
<v Speaker 1>So at this point you might be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about what happens with Nokia and </v>

172
00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:50.120
<v Speaker 1>blackberry when apple stood out from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major companies with the iphone.</v>

173
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:53.330
<v Speaker 1>So now I ask you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think we could compare Tesla with</v>

174
00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:58.060
<v Speaker 1>apple?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:09:58.061 --> 00:09:59.980
<v Speaker 1>I do not believe that the answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy,</v>

176
00:09:59.981 --> 00:10:03.970
<v Speaker 1>but I do believe there are at least a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of differences that we do have to</v>

177
00:10:03.971 --> 00:10:05.380
<v Speaker 1>take into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First.</v>

178
00:10:05.410 --> 00:10:06.243
<v Speaker 1>Apple was always worried about earning </v>
<v Speaker 1>money with the iphone and seconds that </v>

179
00:10:09.570 --> 00:10:11.800
<v Speaker 1>product with something really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really disruptive.</v>

180
00:10:11.830 --> 00:10:14.830
<v Speaker 1>So much so there's even the competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted its failure.</v>

181
00:10:15.410 --> 00:10:20.060
<v Speaker 1>What Steve Ballmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the then CEO of Microsoft said $500</v>

182
00:10:20.150 --> 00:10:20.983
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is the most expensive phone in the </v>

183
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:23.954
<v Speaker 3>world and it doesn't appeal to business </v>
<v Speaker 3>customers because it doesn't have a </v>

184
00:10:26.391 --> 00:10:27.224
<v Speaker 3>keyboard,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which makes it not a very good email </v>

185
00:10:29.301 --> 00:10:30.134
<v Speaker 3>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right now we're selling millions and </v>

186
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.620
<v Speaker 3>millions and millions of phones a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Apple is selling zero phones.</v>

187
00:10:36.621 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 3>A year is six months.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see how the competition goes.</v>

188
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:44.150
<v Speaker 3>Steve Vollmer,</v>
<v Speaker 3>former CEO of Microsoft</v>

189
00:10:44.290 --> 00:10:47.860
<v Speaker 1>$500 I like our strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like it a lot.</v>

190
00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:48.753
<v Speaker 1>As we have seen tesla does not have </v>
<v Speaker 1>money or have any particularly </v>

191
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:52.780
<v Speaker 1>surprising features.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

192
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:53.800
<v Speaker 1>it has to be said.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this,</v>

193
00:10:53.801 --> 00:10:57.520
<v Speaker 1>making your company on money has not </v>
<v Speaker 1>been the most motivating element for its</v>

194
00:10:57.521 --> 00:10:59.350
<v Speaker 1>CEO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The well noon,</v>

195
00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk</v>

196
00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:07.740
<v Speaker 3>mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the vision,</v>

197
00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:08.633
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

198
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.390
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A genius ahead of his time.</v>

199
00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:12.253
<v Speaker 1>These are many opinions about Elon Musk </v>
<v Speaker 1>and entrepreneur who has become a </v>

200
00:11:15.171 --> 00:11:20.171
<v Speaker 1>billionaire from his venture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honest,</v>

201
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:21.953
<v Speaker 1>these are businesses that have never </v>
<v Speaker 1>worried about money with the exception </v>

202
00:11:24.391 --> 00:11:25.590
<v Speaker 1>of paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla,</v>

203
00:11:25.591 --> 00:11:26.760
<v Speaker 1>I bloop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>space x,</v>

204
00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:27.623
<v Speaker 1>anything which Elon Musk is involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>with sounds like science fiction and </v>

205
00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.120
<v Speaker 1>seems to have an infinite budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If something is clear,</v>

206
00:11:33.121 --> 00:11:33.954
<v Speaker 1>it is that with his ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon musk is influencing us in how we </v>

207
00:11:36.721 --> 00:11:38.300
<v Speaker 1>see and to build our future.</v>

208
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.783
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

209
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:46.910
<v Speaker 1>This does not mean that the future is </v>
<v Speaker 1>already written.</v>

210
00:11:47.750 --> 00:11:52.750
<v Speaker 3>Tesla has done very useful work by </v>
<v Speaker 3>opening the market for electric cars and</v>

211
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 3>showing that people</v>

212
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.873
<v Speaker 4>may like them.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Another issue is whether it can earn a </v>

213
00:11:56.951 --> 00:11:59.260
<v Speaker 4>lot of money when it reaches its final </v>
<v Speaker 4>goal.</v>

214
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 4>I won't bet on Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As an investor,</v>

215
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:04.240
<v Speaker 4>I think it will be very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 4>survive.</v>

216
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:08.380
<v Speaker 4>Andres [inaudible] fund manager,</v>
<v Speaker 4>analyst coboss a m</v>

217
00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:12.770
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

218
00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.310
<v Speaker 1>the opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

219
00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.123
<v Speaker 1>Does everything we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the Tesla is a company doomed to </v>

220
00:12:20.171 --> 00:12:21.280
<v Speaker 1>failure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

221
00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:22.960
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saying such a thing.</v>

222
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly not our intention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

223
00:12:25.301 --> 00:12:30.070
<v Speaker 1>because the future is blank definition </v>
<v Speaker 1>on set and as big as Tesla also has many</v>

224
00:12:30.071 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>competitive advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

225
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 1>today it has an obvious technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

226
00:12:34.510 --> 00:12:37.780
<v Speaker 1>It is a leader in the development and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the manufacturing of batteries,</v>

227
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.900
<v Speaker 1>which are the key to any electric car </v>
<v Speaker 1>and very important for growth rate.</v>

228
00:12:41.901 --> 00:12:46.901
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there is also China,</v>

229
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.980
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

230
00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.600
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

231
00:12:54.140 --> 00:12:54.973
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who the biggest market for </v>

232
00:12:56.931 --> 00:12:58.430
<v Speaker 1>electric causes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

233
00:12:58.460 --> 00:13:00.560
<v Speaker 1>you might have guessed it from that last</v>
<v Speaker 1>comment.</v>

234
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>It is indeed China in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More electric cars are sold each year.</v>

235
00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:05.263
<v Speaker 1>Then on the rest of the planet combines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's government has clearly opted </v>

236
00:13:08.511 --> 00:13:09.460
<v Speaker 1>for this technology.</v>

237
00:13:12.830 --> 00:13:13.663
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

238
00:13:16.620 --> 00:13:17.453
<v Speaker 1>Tesla is now negotiating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>installation of a big factory in </v>

239
00:13:19.861 --> 00:13:20.694
<v Speaker 1>Shanghai with rather preferential </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions and you know was it seems </v>

240
00:13:23.791 --> 00:13:24.624
<v Speaker 1>that negotiations with the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments are going in the right </v>

241
00:13:26.731 --> 00:13:28.650
<v Speaker 1>direction anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew the future.</v>

242
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:31.500
<v Speaker 1>Well let us know what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is clear is that Tesla has been</v>

243
00:13:31.501 --> 00:13:33.480
<v Speaker 1>a turning points for the automotive </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

244
00:13:33.510 --> 00:13:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but that is also a fun facing many </v>
<v Speaker 1>risks.</v>

245
00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:38.540
<v Speaker 1>The last one for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from Washington.</v>

246
00:13:38.541 --> 00:13:39.374
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

247
00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:41.580
<v Speaker 2>he</v>

248
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:42.413
<v Speaker 1>is that the fiscal reform of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican Party is going to finish </v>

249
00:13:44.431 --> 00:13:46.650
<v Speaker 1>public aid for the purchase of electric </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars.</v>

250
00:13:46.710 --> 00:13:48.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will see how that matter runs,</v>

251
00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.220
<v Speaker 1>but when Hong Kong did something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

252
00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:52.440
<v Speaker 1>tesla sales fell markedly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

253
00:13:52.441 --> 00:13:53.274
<v Speaker 1>now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Tesla will be successful </v>

254
00:13:55.141 --> 00:13:57.990
<v Speaker 1>and will become the great car company of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the future?</v>

255
00:13:58.020 --> 00:13:58.853
