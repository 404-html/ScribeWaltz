1
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.553
<v Speaker 1>Would you used to be considered the </v>
<v Speaker 1>safest country in South America and at </v>

2
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:13.500
<v Speaker 1>the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second poorest,</v>

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.600
<v Speaker 1>but now it seems like things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing.</v>

4
00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:16.573
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua is a country full of </v>

5
00:00:18.061 --> 00:00:18.894
<v Speaker 1>contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's President Daniel Ortega likes to </v>

6
00:00:20.671 --> 00:00:24.620
<v Speaker 1>brag about his deep Marxist Leninist </v>
<v Speaker 1>reaps man's.</v>

7
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Yet he defines himself as a Catholic and</v>
<v Speaker 1>just even banned abortion in</v>

8
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.830
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

9
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.723
<v Speaker 1>spine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That facade of moral rectitude doesn't </v>

10
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.960
<v Speaker 1>man facing an open trial for abusing his</v>
<v Speaker 1>stepdaughter.</v>

11
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>Displaying this Daniel Tiger's known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a big time family man.</v>

12
00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:43.413
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the Nicaraguan vice president </v>

13
00:00:45.081 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:45.951 --> 00:00:50.951
<v Speaker 1>that would be as wife Rae Sarria Maria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

15
00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Right now you're thinking Ms Dot Ortega.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not the kind of guy you want to</v>

16
00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 1>have as a president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice.</v>

17
00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you start judging too harshly.</v>

18
00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.933
<v Speaker 1>Here's the other side of that coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been in power since 2007 with a </v>

19
00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:09.231
<v Speaker 1>popular support rating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Higher than sixty cents and even we have</v>

20
00:01:09.511 --> 00:01:12.000
<v Speaker 1>to admit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it comes to foreign relations,</v>

21
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.060
<v Speaker 1>he's a genius.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are You A.</v>

22
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.070
<v Speaker 1>is one of the few countries that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>ties with Iran,</v>

23
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela.</v>

24
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.150
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America,</v>

25
00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.650
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that rise.</v>

26
00:01:26.651 --> 00:01:28.870
<v Speaker 1>Many of his comrades in the Sandinista </v>
<v Speaker 1>Front,</v>

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.733
<v Speaker 1>his political party accused him of </v>
<v Speaker 1>selling his soul to capitalism and that </v>

28
00:01:33.191 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>only entirely wrong here or there in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua is a poor country.</v>

29
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.653
<v Speaker 1>It's also one of the most stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies in the region with an average </v>

30
00:01:40.871 --> 00:01:44.050
<v Speaker 1>GDP growth rates of four point six </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

31
00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.033
<v Speaker 1>The population living below the poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>line is getting smaller and smaller </v>

32
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:48.813
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

33
00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:49.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

34
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.263
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at the immigration statistics </v>

35
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.600
<v Speaker 1>and you'll see an exodus of Guatemalans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mexicans moving to the USA.</v>

36
00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.830
<v Speaker 1>The Nicaraguans citizens seem to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable staying in the home country.</v>

37
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:05.420
<v Speaker 1>Apparently that satisfied</v>

38
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 3>fight with the political situation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least they used to be.</v>

39
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 3>The final straw came with pension </v>
<v Speaker 3>reform.</v>

40
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 3>The government has reduced the amount of</v>
<v Speaker 3>money that tired people get,</v>

41
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 3>and at the same time has increased what </v>
<v Speaker 3>workers have to pay into the system.</v>

42
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.200
<v Speaker 3>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody liked this policy.</v>

43
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:22.780
<v Speaker 3>Now that the businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>northern workers,</v>

44
00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:27.603
<v Speaker 3>and this is how the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>demonstration against Daniel Ortega's </v>

45
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.663
<v Speaker 3>machine started,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they've tried to oppress these protests </v>

46
00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.850
<v Speaker 3>with police brutality and massive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>prison.</v>

47
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.210
<v Speaker 3>Since many people have already lost </v>
<v Speaker 3>their lives,</v>

48
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:40.720
<v Speaker 3>even the government has said or owned </v>
<v Speaker 3>sympathizers to confront the protesters.</v>

49
00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.933
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of these messages have stopped the </v>

50
00:02:43.681 --> 00:02:46.710
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the question becomes,</v>

51
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:47.723
<v Speaker 1>why is all of this happening now when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua has no economic crisis </v>

52
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.433
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we witnessing the end of Daniel </v>

53
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 1>Tiger's rule?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

54
00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.300
<v Speaker 1>we about to see the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sandinista,</v>

55
00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.500
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>today we aren't going to answer all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>

57
00:03:00.701 --> 00:03:05.701
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history on</v>

58
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:11.920
<v Speaker 1>Disney star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

59
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.754
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The title of this section is going to </v>

60
00:03:13.721 --> 00:03:16.740
<v Speaker 1>ring a bell for many of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were alive during the 90 days,</v>

61
00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>you might have heard of the Sandinista </v>
<v Speaker 1>album from the British punk bands.</v>

62
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.560
<v Speaker 1>The clash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is during the eighties,</v>

63
00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.453
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became a symbol of the struggle </v>

64
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.970
<v Speaker 1>against American imperial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

65
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.370
<v Speaker 2>that's fine.</v>

66
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.110
<v Speaker 1>Exam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sandinista friends,</v>

67
00:03:35.111 --> 00:03:35.944
<v Speaker 1>it made its way to power off often </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades of a far right wing </v>

68
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.423
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I tell you that the Sandinista front </v>

69
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:45.430
<v Speaker 1>defines itself as a Marxist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leninist,</v>

70
00:03:45.431 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>anti American political policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won't be surprised,</v>

71
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.234
<v Speaker 1>but here's the funny boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They combine all of that ideology with </v>

72
00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:52.923
<v Speaker 1>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of liberation </v>

73
00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.293
<v Speaker 1>theology?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it was in movement within the </v>

74
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.903
<v Speaker 1>Catholic Church,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially among Latin American Roman </v>

75
00:03:58.901 --> 00:03:59.734
<v Speaker 1>Catholics and his followers were die </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard supporters of the Sandinista </v>

76
00:04:03.011 --> 00:04:03.844
<v Speaker 1>comrades there some message of genuine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christian anymore than you see on the </v>

77
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:13.630
<v Speaker 1>screen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Daniel Ortega.</v>

78
00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:14.493
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was already the leader of the </v>

79
00:04:15.881 --> 00:04:19.060
<v Speaker 1>Sandinista fronts and the presidents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua,</v>

80
00:04:19.240 --> 00:04:22.410
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of the Cold War America.</v>

81
00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>I wasn't about to let this country fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>under communist rule without a fight.</v>

82
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
<v Speaker 1>That's why then American president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan organized one of the most </v>

83
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>controversial decisions in American </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

84
00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.170
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he sold his weapons to the ISR elders in</v>

85
00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.450
<v Speaker 1>Iran who were fighting Saddam Hussein's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq.</v>

86
00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:38.313
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a top secret deal because Iran </v>

87
00:04:39.971 --> 00:04:42.280
<v Speaker 1>was officially an enemy of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

88
00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.233
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he took all the money from the sales to </v>

89
00:04:44.861 --> 00:04:47.570
<v Speaker 1>finance the so called Contrera in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua.</v>

90
00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.483
<v Speaker 1>The concert were a far right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist group that fought against the </v>

91
00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>governments of Daniel Ortega.</v>

92
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:54.533
<v Speaker 4>I'm speaking of Nicaraguan,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a Soviet era on the American mainland </v>

93
00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.920
<v Speaker 4>only two hours flying time from our own </v>
<v Speaker 4>borders or our own security.</v>

94
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:05.970
<v Speaker 4>The United States must deny the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 4>Union a beachhead in North America.</v>

95
00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:08.280
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when the story got leaks,</v>

96
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:12.640
<v Speaker 1>the media went pretty crazy and so did </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world of music.</v>

97
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.533
<v Speaker 1>That's why we have so many songs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>records from those times from the clash </v>

98
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:21.420
<v Speaker 1>to Kris Kristofferson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

99
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:22.263
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did Daniel Ortega do while he was </v>

100
00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.180
<v Speaker 1>empowered?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will?</v>

101
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.013
<v Speaker 1>In a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see that he set a precedent </v>

102
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.690
<v Speaker 1>for Nicolas Maduro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela.</v>

103
00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.733
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sandinista government nationalized </v>

104
00:05:31.481 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>all of the companies that were in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands of the local oligarchs,</v>

105
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and how did they pay for all of that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:38.824
<v Speaker 1>they did that by getting more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>loans from the Soviet Union and of </v>

107
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.110
<v Speaker 1>course printing money like there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>

108
00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>and what was the outcome of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:46.654
<v Speaker 1>in the year 1986 soft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little more than five years under our </v>

110
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:50.004
<v Speaker 1>tag is rural Nicaragua with suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one of the worst cases of </v>

111
00:05:52.931 --> 00:05:57.931
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation of all time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bitterest of the conflict</v>

112
00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.933
<v Speaker 3>between the countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Former Sunday nice to leaders and </v>

113
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 3>American backed rebels'.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All Nicaraguans shared one crucial piece</v>

114
00:06:04.521 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 3>of common ground,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reliance on the American dollar.</v>

115
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Just imagine that the value of the local</v>
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>

116
00:06:10.411 --> 00:06:13.950
<v Speaker 1>the Cordoba would value every 15 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that if you bought a beer one</v>

117
00:06:13.951 --> 00:06:14.784
<v Speaker 1>day and paid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say 10 goal date is yet to come back </v>

118
00:06:16.471 --> 00:06:20.580
<v Speaker 1>four months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same beer would be over 3000.</v>

119
00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:21.533
<v Speaker 1>Now we've told you many times here on </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual policy that the worst thing that </v>

120
00:06:24.121 --> 00:06:26.970
<v Speaker 1>can happen to a country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation.</v>

121
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:32.090
<v Speaker 1>This is why despite the fact that Daniel</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ortega have so much support to citizens,</v>

122
00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.870
<v Speaker 1>showed him that backs.</v>

123
00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:37.540
<v Speaker 3>This is why in the year 1990 Nicaragua </v>
<v Speaker 3>had a new currency,</v>

124
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.433
<v Speaker 3>the Golden Cordoba,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at a different government this time of </v>

125
00:06:40.531 --> 00:06:41.364
<v Speaker 3>conservative one during the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Ortega was the leader of the </v>

126
00:06:43.691 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 3>opposition party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Meanwhile,</v>

127
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 3>the country was getting rid of that </v>
<v Speaker 3>hyperinflation and it was coming back to</v>

128
00:06:48.311 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 3>the situation of stable pop.</v>

129
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:53.193
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

130
00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.083
<v Speaker 3>Nicaraguans kept being poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at least they didn't have big </v>

131
00:06:56.491 --> 00:06:57.324
<v Speaker 3>surprises.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The purchasing power wouldn't diminish </v>

132
00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.760
<v Speaker 3>because there's not so much inflation </v>
<v Speaker 3>and there were no more wars or terrorist</v>

133
00:07:02.761 --> 00:07:03.594
<v Speaker 3>attacks</v>

134
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>and this is how we get to the year 2006 </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>

135
00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>When Nicaragua Hell's new elections and </v>
<v Speaker 1>not civil,</v>

136
00:07:12.981 --> 00:07:13.814
<v Speaker 1>look at what happens</v>

137
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 3>to Ortegas</v>

138
00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:21.333
<v Speaker 1>in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we'll take a [inaudible] to the </v>

139
00:07:22.691 --> 00:07:25.420
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time he was a different version</v>

140
00:07:25.421 --> 00:07:26.440
<v Speaker 1>of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

141
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:28.480
<v Speaker 1>he was still a member of the Sandinista </v>
<v Speaker 1>fronts,</v>

142
00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>but so many years as the opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>helped reshape his ideas,</v>

143
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.183
<v Speaker 3>neil or take a no longer supports </v>
<v Speaker 3>Marxist Leninism and is now a supporter </v>

144
00:07:39.851 --> 00:07:42.220
<v Speaker 3>of Ortega.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That is the problem.</v>

145
00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:44.200
<v Speaker 3>Testimonial from a Sunday to supporter.</v>

146
00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:45.173
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brand new version of Daniel Ortega </v>

147
00:07:46.950 --> 00:07:51.200
<v Speaker 1>still sticks to the same old socialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>rhetoric is government guarantees,</v>

148
00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>universal access to healthcare and </v>
<v Speaker 1>education in facts,</v>

149
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:55.034
<v Speaker 1>but if the literacy rates and average </v>
<v Speaker 1>life expectancy have increased in the </v>

150
00:07:57.391 --> 00:07:58.224
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that rush for nationalization has </v>

151
00:08:00.481 --> 00:08:03.150
<v Speaker 1>given way to more moderate discourse,</v>

152
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:08.400
<v Speaker 5>look over there.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Look,</v>

153
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:13.510
<v Speaker 3>white collar workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>blue collar workers,</v>

154
00:08:13.550 --> 00:08:14.900
<v Speaker 3>farmers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>producers,</v>

155
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.780
<v Speaker 3>entrepreneurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>small businessmen,</v>

156
00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:17.653
<v Speaker 3>and big businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>all the economic and social powers of </v>

157
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:23.060
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's work together.</v>

158
00:08:23.730 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 5>Oh No.</v>

159
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:25.561
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

160
00:08:25.561 --> 00:08:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Hand because does even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years ago,</v>

161
00:08:27.661 --> 00:08:30.390
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua was the guy that the US love </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hate,</v>

162
00:08:30.420 --> 00:08:32.340
<v Speaker 1>but now they've signed a free trade with</v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

163
00:08:32.400 --> 00:08:33.233
<v Speaker 1>The so called Captain Mans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they celebrate with counselor Naco </v>

164
00:08:36.150 --> 00:08:36.983
<v Speaker 1>operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bear in mind that the American </v>

165
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:39.084
<v Speaker 1>agriculture market is protected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but chocolate coffee and bananas from </v>

166
00:08:41.641 --> 00:08:42.474
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua as the exception to that rule,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they find it way easier to get into </v>

167
00:08:45.721 --> 00:08:50.721
<v Speaker 1>those American mark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This still isn't the end of our story.</v>

168
00:08:53.810 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember about special economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>zones?</v>

169
00:08:56.071 --> 00:08:56.904
<v Speaker 1>I've told you about them in a video </v>
<v Speaker 1>before basically that an area inside of </v>

170
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:03.990
<v Speaker 1>a developing country with lower taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more business friendly rules.</v>

171
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua has got one.</v>

172
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>The images you're beginning to see on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen now,</v>

173
00:09:08.430 --> 00:09:12.660
<v Speaker 1>they belong to an ad made by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to attract foreign investors.</v>

174
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.950
<v Speaker 6>If someone was thinking of investing in </v>
<v Speaker 6>it broadwell,</v>

175
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:15.813
<v Speaker 6>I would encourage her to come down and I</v>
<v Speaker 6>think they'll find the same advantages </v>

176
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:24.081
<v Speaker 6>that we found nod with close to the US,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a frog bilingual population availability</v>

177
00:09:25.081 --> 00:09:26.660
<v Speaker 6>of,</v>
<v Speaker 6>of highly educated workforce.</v>

178
00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:28.860
<v Speaker 1>Surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems this insole.</v>

179
00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:32.220
<v Speaker 1>Tiger came to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua has been flooded with new call</v>

180
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:33.054
<v Speaker 1>centers from international companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She played a special taxes and most </v>

181
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.044
<v Speaker 1>importantly of all the opportunity to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>business in the only country with new </v>

182
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:42.720
<v Speaker 1>street violence or guerrillas </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

183
00:09:42.750 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened to Daniel Ortega?</v>

184
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>Did he have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any?</v>

185
00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course not.</v>

186
00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:50.760
<v Speaker 1>He just learns that when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

187
00:09:50.770 --> 00:09:54.290
<v Speaker 1>he does well under your rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easier to stay in power.</v>

188
00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.230
<v Speaker 1>This is why in election after election </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Tavi gets more than 60 percent of the</v>

189
00:09:58.231 --> 00:10:00.840
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course these elections are rigged,</v>

190
00:10:00.930 --> 00:10:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but only a fool would say the total </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tayga has no popular support.</v>

191
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:05.693
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's also another reason for this </v>

192
00:10:06.541 --> 00:10:07.374
<v Speaker 1>ideological change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if the economy of your country is </v>

193
00:10:09.571 --> 00:10:12.810
<v Speaker 1>doing or rice and you control every </v>
<v Speaker 1>facet of your country,</v>

194
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>your personal finances at giving to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>procedure.</v>

195
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.980
<v Speaker 1>Dawn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>

196
00:10:19.160 --> 00:10:19.993
<v Speaker 3>The precedent Daniel Ortega has put his </v>
<v Speaker 3>wife and sons and important government </v>

197
00:10:23.041 --> 00:10:25.350
<v Speaker 3>positions while his family has gotten </v>
<v Speaker 3>rich.</v>

198
00:10:25.410 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 3>Thanks for Venezuelan oil.</v>

199
00:10:26.880 --> 00:10:27.713
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's government has invested a good </v>

200
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:31.800
<v Speaker 1>share of that money in avoiding school </v>
<v Speaker 1>rivalries.</v>

201
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:32.663
<v Speaker 1>Eventually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every media station in Nicaragua is </v>

202
00:10:35.041 --> 00:10:35.874
<v Speaker 1>owned by the governments or some </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessmen that's connected to Daniel </v>

203
00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:39.811
<v Speaker 1>Ortega,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

204
00:10:39.811 --> 00:10:40.644
<v Speaker 1>there's a new social media law which </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to be discussed in March of </v>

205
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:45.330
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this would allow the ruling class to</v>

206
00:10:45.331 --> 00:10:48.170
<v Speaker 1>censor and chase political activists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

207
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:50.420
<v Speaker 1>protests have started for a totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>different reason.</v>

208
00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:51.530
<v Speaker 1>That's how I look at that.</v>

209
00:10:55.380 --> 00:10:57.330
<v Speaker 3>Why do they protest?</v>
<v Speaker 3>In Nicaragua,</v>

210
00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:01.000
<v Speaker 1>common wisdom says that revolutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen when it comes free.</v>

211
00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:03.190
<v Speaker 1>Isn't a big crisis rice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

212
00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that's actually a big mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

213
00:11:05.020 --> 00:11:08.470
<v Speaker 1>revolutions happened when a country was </v>
<v Speaker 1>going through dire straights,</v>

214
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>but is now starting to go,</v>

215
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.193
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

216
00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Implying is this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

217
00:11:13.971 --> 00:11:16.700
<v Speaker 1>basically if nobody around you is </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving a cadillac,</v>

218
00:11:16.701 --> 00:11:19.220
<v Speaker 1>then they're all cadillacs to be jealous</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

219
00:11:19.310 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 1>You can probably see where I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>

220
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:21.943
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaraguan saw witnessing the advent of </v>

221
00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:28.060
<v Speaker 1>a brand's knew at least the friends of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Ortega.</v>

222
00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:32.690
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true.</v>

223
00:11:32.691 --> 00:11:36.680
<v Speaker 1>The whole country is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some long growing faster than others</v>

224
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:37.693
<v Speaker 1>and only the most naive believed that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this new aristocracy got rich entirely </v>

225
00:11:40.851 --> 00:11:41.684
<v Speaker 1>on their own merits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we call the populist </v>

226
00:11:44.211 --> 00:11:45.044
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so window of opportunity where the </v>

227
00:11:46.070 --> 00:11:49.880
<v Speaker 1>governments can change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is like filling a room with gas.</v>

228
00:11:49.881 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>You just need flick of a lighter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything explodes.</v>

229
00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.680
<v Speaker 2>Contract Marshall,</v>

230
00:11:57.710 --> 00:12:00.110
<v Speaker 1>I n s,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s law has already passed.</v>

231
00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.033
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government has decided to lower </v>

232
00:12:02.481 --> 00:12:05.090
<v Speaker 1>pension swell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing contributions.</v>

233
00:12:05.180 --> 00:12:06.013
<v Speaker 1>Businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers and students have taken to the </v>

234
00:12:07.821 --> 00:12:10.670
<v Speaker 1>streets like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spent years waiting for the opportunity.</v>

235
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.140
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people protesting and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's.</v>

236
00:12:17.260 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>The government doesn't know how to </v>
<v Speaker 1>react.</v>

237
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:19.743
<v Speaker 1>This is why they have forced all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaraguan TV stations to stop </v>

238
00:12:22.930 --> 00:12:23.763
<v Speaker 1>broadcasting the demonstrations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite all of this protests being </v>

239
00:12:26.561 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>organized all over the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only in the capital,</v>

240
00:12:30.130 --> 00:12:30.963
<v Speaker 1>even in its smallest villages in facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we know about this because we've saved </v>

241
00:12:33.551 --> 00:12:36.520
<v Speaker 1>thousands of messages from protestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>

242
00:12:36.521 --> 00:12:37.354
<v Speaker 1>visual politics also got a Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>language version and those he watched </v>

243
00:12:39.971 --> 00:12:40.804
<v Speaker 1>that channel from Nicaragua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've sent hundreds of videos from </v>

244
00:12:43.361 --> 00:12:48.361
<v Speaker 1>universities in these videos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that students,</v>

245
00:12:50.581 --> 00:12:53.670
<v Speaker 1>they've been sitting there for days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people bringing them food and water,</v>

246
00:12:53.671 --> 00:12:54.504
<v Speaker 1>but then a policeman will come and take </v>
<v Speaker 1>it away and we have plenty of images of </v>

247
00:12:57.271 --> 00:12:59.280
<v Speaker 1>police brutality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to show here,</v>

248
00:12:59.520 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 1>but trust us when we say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaraguan police,</v>

249
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:06.120
<v Speaker 1>they're doing everything they can to </v>
<v Speaker 1>repress these protests.</v>

250
00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:11.100
<v Speaker 1>It's big time clash forces in what used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the most peaceful country in South</v>

251
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:11.190
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

252
00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

253
00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.720
<v Speaker 1>Now the question you might ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this the end of Daniel Ortega's role?</v>

254
00:13:19.770 --> 00:13:21.460
<v Speaker 1>And as we always say here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic,</v>

255
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.610
<v Speaker 1>you can never make accurate predictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to politics and economics.</v>

256
00:13:25.670 --> 00:13:28.070
<v Speaker 1>Having almost a protest as doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>really mean anything.</v>

257
00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:29.083
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we still don't know if all these </v>

258
00:13:30.621 --> 00:13:33.320
<v Speaker 1>political activists serve a common cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a common leader.</v>

259
00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:34.273
<v Speaker 1>According to the messages we get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal factions as well as some die </v>

260
00:13:37.561 --> 00:13:42.290
<v Speaker 1>hard Sandinista people who feel the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade by Mr Ortega's ideological shift.</v>

261
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.670
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things like special economic zones,</v>

262
00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:51.160
<v Speaker 1>not very Marxist Leninist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

263
00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.023
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there isn't much organization and </v>

264
00:13:53.861 --> 00:13:54.694
<v Speaker 1>there's no real leader that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalize on all this popular unrest </v>

265
00:13:57.730 --> 00:13:59.470
<v Speaker 1>with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is hard to offer.</v>

266
00:13:59.471 --> 00:14:01.540
<v Speaker 1>A real alternative to the official.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

267
00:14:01.590 --> 00:14:02.423
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

268
00:14:06.510 --> 00:14:08.970
<v Speaker 1>That's our opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are visual politic.</v>

00:14:08.971 --> 00:14:12.750
<v Speaker 1>Now we'd like to know yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is going to happen?</v>

270
00:14:12.751 --> 00:14:13.584
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think Daniel Ortega will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to step down from power or will we </v>

271
00:14:17.171 --> 00:14:19.830
<v Speaker 1>see many more years of Sandy aneurysm?</v>
