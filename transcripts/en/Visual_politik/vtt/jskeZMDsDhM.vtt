00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.520
<v Speaker 1>So have you guys have requested faster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a video about France now Francis,</v>

2
00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.740
<v Speaker 1>one of the wealthiest countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>welds.</v>

3
00:00:13.741 --> 00:00:15.540
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One with some of the artists,</v>

4
00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:16.374
<v Speaker 1>economic problems today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France is the second largest economic </v>

5
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.400
<v Speaker 1>power in the European Union bus that </v>
<v Speaker 1>might not last for much longer.</v>

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.840
<v Speaker 1>They youth unemployment rate is over 23 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent in their public debt is twice as</v>

7
00:00:27.841 --> 00:00:32.841
<v Speaker 1>big as that entire GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ten years ago,</v>

8
00:00:34.061 --> 00:00:38.470
<v Speaker 1>the entire world was buying Renno cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Alcatel mobile phones,</v>

9
00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:39.483
<v Speaker 1>but today French experts of almonds are </v>
<v Speaker 1>half of what they used to be just a </v>

10
00:00:42.611 --> 00:00:43.444
<v Speaker 1>short time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their companies are simply unable to </v>

11
00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:47.080
<v Speaker 1>face the competition that's coming from </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

12
00:00:47.081 --> 00:00:48.130
<v Speaker 1>from South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>

13
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.160
<v Speaker 1>even from the United States in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as you can imagine,</v>

14
00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>this economic crisis has had a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect on French society.</v>

15
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.863
<v Speaker 1>If you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just have a look at the </v>

16
00:01:02.841 --> 00:01:06.460
<v Speaker 1>presidential elections of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 2017.</v>

17
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.743
<v Speaker 1>None of the candidates from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional parties have made it to the </v>

18
00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:10.684
<v Speaker 1>second rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French voters are simply fed up with </v>

19
00:01:12.821 --> 00:01:13.654
<v Speaker 1>their political establishment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why they've chosen a </v>

20
00:01:15.971 --> 00:01:18.720
<v Speaker 1>politician who wants to make a one 80 </v>
<v Speaker 1>shift in the French</v>

21
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.643
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>

22
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.313
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons behind this French crisis and </v>

23
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.240
<v Speaker 1>more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is macron propose in order to solve</v>

24
00:01:29.241 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>it all today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to answer that question,</v>

25
00:01:31.221 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>but before we get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as usual,</v>

26
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.340
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the history,</v>

27
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

28
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.550
<v Speaker 1>is to the French people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right after World War Two,</v>

29
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>all the European powers were on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verge of bankruptcy men.</v>

30
00:01:45.081 --> 00:01:45.914
<v Speaker 1>This included France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half the country was destroyed by </v>

31
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>bombing and this included houses as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as factories.</v>

32
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.233
<v Speaker 1>Luckily enough though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uncle Sam was there and then he was </v>

33
00:01:54.131 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 1>ready to</v>

34
00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:57.640
<v Speaker 2>hell no</v>

35
00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.843
<v Speaker 1>states was interested in having a strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe say that the consonants could </v>

36
00:02:02.311 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>purchase goods from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lead duty,</v>

37
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.840
<v Speaker 1>so called Marshall Plan being put into </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

38
00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:10.020
<v Speaker 1>It was a cash injection of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

39
00:02:10.021 --> 00:02:13.170
<v Speaker 1>which would lead to the reconstruction </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the European nations,</v>

40
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.103
<v Speaker 1>but do hold on just a minute because </v>
<v Speaker 1>each of these countries use the finance </v>

41
00:02:16.741 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>in very different ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

42
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:22.770
<v Speaker 1>the German government created that </v>
<v Speaker 1>political theory called auto liberalism,</v>

43
00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:23.643
<v Speaker 1>a gay social liberalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a combination of social </v>

44
00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 1>programs and free enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

45
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.850
<v Speaker 1>the government would provide a safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>net for their citizens and subsidize the</v>

46
00:02:32.851 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>companies as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand is these companies</v>

47
00:02:35.521 --> 00:02:37.680
<v Speaker 1>were privates as they could compete with</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

48
00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 1>A very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different case.</v>

49
00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.543
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president was general Charles de </v>

50
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.300
<v Speaker 1>Gaulle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he was no friend of free enterprise,</v>

51
00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:52.170
<v Speaker 1>so his political theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Deer Ridge Ism was pretty different from</v>

52
00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:53.004
<v Speaker 1>that of the gym.</v>

53
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>His cabinet</v>

54
00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.193
<v Speaker 1>is not giving proposals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to give so used all of this money </v>

55
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:04.570
<v Speaker 1>from the United States do nationalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the big corporations,</v>

56
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.490
<v Speaker 1>steel factories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electric companies,</v>

57
00:03:06.491 --> 00:03:07.324
<v Speaker 1>phone companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the car making them off like Renno </v>

58
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.803
<v Speaker 1>and citron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all had the government as their </v>

59
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:14.590
<v Speaker 1>biggest shareholder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

60
00:03:14.591 --> 00:03:15.424
<v Speaker 1>they also created a deregister system on</v>
<v Speaker 1>society where the state would play a </v>

61
00:03:18.731 --> 00:03:19.564
<v Speaker 1>major role in all areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including conditions for hiring workers </v>

62
00:03:22.421 --> 00:03:25.810
<v Speaker 1>as well as the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a really important point because</v>

63
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>not all welfare states that created the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same in Germany.</v>

64
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.524
<v Speaker 1>There was no minimum wage and there was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bigger space for trade unions and </v>

65
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>companies do negotiate contract </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>

66
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.243
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare was provided by private </v>

67
00:03:36.311 --> 00:03:37.144
<v Speaker 1>insurance and regional governments has a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot to say when it came to the laws and </v>

68
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:41.290
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

69
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>in France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the social policies came from the</v>

70
00:03:44.111 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 1>central authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>

71
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 1>to go represents kind of the opposite of</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we like era,</v>

72
00:03:48.701 --> 00:03:49.130
<v Speaker 1>visual,</v>

73
00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.963
<v Speaker 2>holistic,</v>

74
00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:57.350
<v Speaker 1>but despite all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during these first few years after World</v>

75
00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.460
<v Speaker 1>War Two from center to these so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorious 30 for three decades,</v>

76
00:04:01.461 --> 00:04:02.294
<v Speaker 1>the average wage triples and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies sponsored by the governments </v>

77
00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.290
<v Speaker 1>became a global leader.</v>

78
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:13.313
<v Speaker 1>Give some context.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was way before American companies </v>

79
00:04:15.511 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 1>started moving their factories to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renu initial inward opening factories in</v>

80
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:22.440
<v Speaker 1>Spain where salaries were much lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be honest,</v>

81
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.333
<v Speaker 1>during that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every European country was growing at </v>

82
00:04:25.351 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>the same rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it.</v>

83
00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.953
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the 19 sixties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was not the economic powerhouse </v>

84
00:04:30.871 --> 00:04:31.704
<v Speaker 1>that it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America was full of dictatorships </v>

85
00:04:33.931 --> 00:04:34.764
<v Speaker 1>of all kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Soviet Union was simply unable </v>

86
00:04:36.691 --> 00:04:40.140
<v Speaker 1>to produce high enough quality goods to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sold in the international market.</v>

87
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:41.303
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France had unimportant industrial </v>

88
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:45.570
<v Speaker 1>tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've had a well educated society,</v>

89
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:48.930
<v Speaker 1>and overall it had good rule of law and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable political system</v>

90
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.853
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

91
00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1958,</v>

92
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:59.410
<v Speaker 1>so those countries already rebuilds by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Marshall Plan,</v>

93
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.393
<v Speaker 1>decided to create a free trade union </v>
<v Speaker 1>which would eventually become the </v>

94
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.921
<v Speaker 1>European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At this time,</v>

95
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>if France had the largest population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these countries,</v>

96
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:09.250
<v Speaker 1>and I don't forget the back in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

97
00:05:09.251 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Germany was still divided into two hops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this meant that France was in the</v>

98
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 1>strongest position.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you negotiate that entry conditions?</v>

99
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.160
<v Speaker 1>And as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>

100
00:05:18.161 --> 00:05:18.994
<v Speaker 1>the goal was no fan of free trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He used his negotiating how to make </v>

101
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:25.630
<v Speaker 1>France the dominant country in certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>industries such as aggregate</v>

102
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:26.563
<v Speaker 2>culture,</v>

103
00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

104
00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.033
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't help anything nor means </v>

105
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:33.984
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you are watching this video from </v>

106
00:05:35.401 --> 00:05:36.234
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have heard about the common </v>

107
00:05:37.771 --> 00:05:38.604
<v Speaker 1>agricultural policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a policy created to keep </v>

108
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.553
<v Speaker 1>European consumers from buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural goods from the developing </v>

109
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:45.630
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

110
00:05:45.631 --> 00:05:50.010
<v Speaker 1>it also imposes production quotas inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the European economic area.</v>

111
00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:50.963
<v Speaker 1>This means Polish or Spanish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farmers cannot sell enough that they </v>

112
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.534
<v Speaker 1>want to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is a maximum quota imposed by </v>

113
00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:58.790
<v Speaker 1>Brussels and you can probably guess </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

114
00:05:58.791 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was a French invention.</v>

115
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.650
<v Speaker 1>It helps explain things like,</v>

116
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:03.643
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

117
00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.540
<v Speaker 1>price value of 70 point 4 billion euros </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2011.</v>

118
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.600
<v Speaker 1>French agricultural production is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader in Europe.</v>

119
00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:16.323
<v Speaker 1>The goal held power for decades and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>following French presidents kept this </v>

120
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:22.540
<v Speaker 1>dirigiste model at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 19 sixties and seventies,</v>

121
00:06:22.541 --> 00:06:25.390
<v Speaker 1>France was on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if something works,</v>

122
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.830
<v Speaker 1>why would you fix it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

123
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:30.130
<v Speaker 1>well actually now I'm going to tell you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly why you should fix it,</v>

124
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.210
<v Speaker 2>st</v>

125
00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.923
<v Speaker 1>to a different problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem starts when the rest of the </v>

126
00:06:36.251 --> 00:06:38.410
<v Speaker 1>world is running faster than you were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>

127
00:06:38.411 --> 00:06:41.230
<v Speaker 1>Talking about the eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Berlin Wall came down.</v>

128
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:45.580
<v Speaker 1>China started opening up their economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of new countries like Spain and</v>

129
00:06:45.581 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 1>Greece became members of the European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

130
00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:48.443
<v Speaker 2>union,</v>

131
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:52.510
<v Speaker 1>and of course all of these countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to sell their products.</v>

132
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:55.300
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the sudden France had rifles,</v>

133
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:58.870
<v Speaker 1>and this is what explains why this kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of news is quite so common,</v>

134
00:06:59.080 --> 00:06:59.913
<v Speaker 1>furious French farmers who have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking Spanish fruit and vegetable </v>

135
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.530
<v Speaker 1>deliveries has affects of the e coli </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

136
00:07:05.531 --> 00:07:06.364
<v Speaker 1>continue to bite Spanish producers of </v>
<v Speaker 1>slash their prices to make up for huge </v>

137
00:07:10.511 --> 00:07:15.190
<v Speaker 1>losses and now up to forty cents a kilo </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper than their French counterparts.</v>

138
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:16.743
<v Speaker 1>The same happens with other industries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this chart that </v>

139
00:07:19.151 --> 00:07:24.151
<v Speaker 1>represents the trade balance in France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pay Attention.</v>

140
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:29.480
<v Speaker 1>You can see how often the nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports on dropping slowly.</v>

141
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:33.200
<v Speaker 1>This trend is especially true after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis,</v>

142
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.640
<v Speaker 1>so maybe you under the Alcatel mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

143
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.503
<v Speaker 1>these were mobile phones that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>really popular when mobile phones were </v>

144
00:07:39.821 --> 00:07:40.654
<v Speaker 1>just becoming a thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alcatel was an absolute juggernaut in </v>

145
00:07:43.961 --> 00:07:44.794
<v Speaker 1>this area and now they've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared in a market dominated by </v>

146
00:07:50.661 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>American Chinese and South Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

147
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.180
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one example of how </v>
<v Speaker 1>France is losing their ability to</v>

148
00:07:57.410 --> 00:07:58.243
<v Speaker 2>innovative.</v>

149
00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.573
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering what of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>the French government's done to tackle </v>

150
00:08:04.191 --> 00:08:05.300
<v Speaker 1>this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

151
00:08:05.301 --> 00:08:08.150
<v Speaker 1>really they just protected the companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the rest of the welds.</v>

152
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:09.920
<v Speaker 1>For an opposite example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at Sweden.</v>

153
00:08:09.921 --> 00:08:13.340
<v Speaker 1>He makes Volvo cars where the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>company wanted to buy this from.</v>

154
00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.730
<v Speaker 1>The Swedish government didn't intervene </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all in Sweden.</v>

155
00:08:16.731 --> 00:08:20.150
<v Speaker 1>There was a clear separation between </v>
<v Speaker 1>business and the state,</v>

156
00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.980
<v Speaker 1>but we cannot say the same of France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have a look at what happens when it</v>

157
00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.400
<v Speaker 1>Pepsi wanted to buy the new moon in 2000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

158
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.333
<v Speaker 2>fine</v>

159
00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.103
<v Speaker 1>barlow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The labor minister said the government </v>

160
00:08:32.091 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>will do all we can to oppose a bid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Terry Britain,</v>

161
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>the finance minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pledge to protect Donald,</v>

162
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.270
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the only thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't change.</v>

163
00:08:41.271 --> 00:08:42.104
<v Speaker 1>In France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're social spending is still the </v>

164
00:08:43.611 --> 00:08:44.444
<v Speaker 1>highest in the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even larger than that of the Nordic </v>

165
00:08:47.241 --> 00:08:49.940
<v Speaker 1>countries and further the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration employees,</v>

166
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.783
<v Speaker 1>more civil sevens than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>European country and their salaries are </v>

167
00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:55.603
<v Speaker 1>also pretty enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically France has a lower income </v>

168
00:08:58.741 --> 00:08:59.574
<v Speaker 1>than they had in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they keep spending like they did </v>

169
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.364
<v Speaker 1>during the glory days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why their public debt is </v>

170
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.874
<v Speaker 1>quite as large as it is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what things they might just be on the </v>

171
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:09.510
<v Speaker 1>verge of change.</v>

172
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:14.180
<v Speaker 1>Crones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quiet revolution.</v>

173
00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.103
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so politicians do you promise a lot </v>

174
00:09:16.461 --> 00:09:19.940
<v Speaker 1>during elections and they don't do </v>
<v Speaker 1>always deliver on those promises,</v>

175
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.400
<v Speaker 1>but there is something we have to admit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of Kronk,</v>

176
00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:26.770
<v Speaker 1>his program is a complete break with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>French dirigisme.</v>

177
00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.910
<v Speaker 1>All the political analysts have labeled </v>
<v Speaker 1>this man,</v>

178
00:09:28.911 --> 00:09:29.744
<v Speaker 1>is it motor a politician?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to continue the work of his </v>

179
00:09:31.611 --> 00:09:33.980
<v Speaker 1>predecessors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the big question is,</v>

180
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:37.130
<v Speaker 1>is that really true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that some of his proposals,</v>

181
00:09:37.131 --> 00:09:37.964
<v Speaker 1>they've never even been put forward by </v>
<v Speaker 1>another French presidents from any side </v>

182
00:09:41.091 --> 00:09:41.924
<v Speaker 1>of the political spectrum is precisely a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big reform program to open up a series </v>

183
00:09:46.971 --> 00:09:51.971
<v Speaker 1>of services and increased competition in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of products.</v>

184
00:09:52.011 --> 00:09:52.844
<v Speaker 1>And good markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>transportation on some for the better </v>

185
00:09:56.011 --> 00:09:56.844
<v Speaker 1>understanding in an electoral campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>that became famous because of the </v>

186
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:00.053
<v Speaker 1>populous tone of Mrs [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Macron is proposing to retire over </v>

187
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:03.834
<v Speaker 1>120,000 civil sevens know many of you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might think that this is a pretty </v>

188
00:10:07.531 --> 00:10:08.364
<v Speaker 1>horrible idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is something we must admit </v>

189
00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:12.103
<v Speaker 1>he's being on it.</v>

190
00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:13.513
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

191
00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:17.340
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the politician who would suggest such an</v>

192
00:10:17.341 --> 00:10:19.950
<v Speaker 1>unpopular thing during an election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

193
00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:20.813
<v Speaker 1>macron has won this election by often </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing the opposite of what a candidate </v>

194
00:10:24.211 --> 00:10:26.580
<v Speaker 1>should supposedly do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On his manifesto,</v>

195
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:30.060
<v Speaker 1>he promised that he would never reduce </v>
<v Speaker 1>the return and sage and other words,</v>

196
00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.010
<v Speaker 1>macron is really committed to reducing </v>
<v Speaker 1>French publix</v>

197
00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:34.640
<v Speaker 2>ending</v>

198
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 1>on the other hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macron combines all of these budget cuts</v>

199
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:43.100
<v Speaker 1>with lowering taxes and helping small </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in his own words.</v>

200
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.963
<v Speaker 1>Macron wants to substitute the French </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirigisme with something closer to the </v>

201
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.304
<v Speaker 1>model of Germany or Sweden where welfare</v>
<v Speaker 1>states coexist with the free market </v>

202
00:10:50.791 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

203
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:53.484
<v Speaker 1>even after winning the elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does he have any actual power to make </v>

204
00:10:55.501 --> 00:10:56.700
<v Speaker 1>this happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In France?</v>

205
00:10:56.701 --> 00:11:00.420
<v Speaker 1>The president doesn't have as much power</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the American president sends.</v>

206
00:11:00.450 --> 00:11:01.283
<v Speaker 1>Every lawyer wants to pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has to go through parliaments and now </v>

207
00:11:03.991 --> 00:11:07.870
<v Speaker 1>the question has to be who is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest force in parliaments weld.</v>

208
00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:11.700
<v Speaker 1>That is something we're not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>know until the summer of 2017 in June.</v>

209
00:11:11.701 --> 00:11:12.534
<v Speaker 1>French people are going to go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the voting stations and this time </v>

210
00:11:14.821 --> 00:11:15.654
<v Speaker 1>they're voting and legislative elections</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is here that the party of Marine </v>

211
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Le Pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national front,</v>

212
00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.140
<v Speaker 1>has a better chance of becoming the main</v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

213
00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.120
<v Speaker 1>What does the French for our rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually want?</v>

214
00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd like to know more about that,</v>

215
00:11:29.621 --> 00:11:31.810
<v Speaker 1>you should definitely check out one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our previous videos,</v>

<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

217
00:11:33.330 --> 00:11:34.163
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

218
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.213
<v Speaker 1>And now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you really believe in this quiet </v>

219
00:11:39.961 --> 00:11:40.794
<v Speaker 1>revolution of Emmanuel Macron?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe that he can pull from </v>

220
00:11:43.140 --> 00:11:43.973
<v Speaker 1>sound of the whole?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think French stagnation has a </v>

221
00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:46.704
<v Speaker 1>solution?</v>
