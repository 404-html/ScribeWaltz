1
00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:11.720
<v Speaker 1>Romania might be the first country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world to legalized corruption.</v>

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that writes,</v>

3
00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:14.203
<v Speaker 1>in January 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Romanian parliaments passed an </v>

4
00:00:16.611 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>ordinance which allow politicians to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept bribes,</v>

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:20.323
<v Speaker 1>have almost $50,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These bribes can happen without any </v>

6
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.570
<v Speaker 1>kinds of legal repercussions whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

7
00:00:26.571 --> 00:00:29.240
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this infamous ordinance triggered one of</v>

8
00:00:29.241 --> 00:00:30.074
<v Speaker 1>the biggest political demonstrations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the country has seen for over 20 </v>

9
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:38.921
<v Speaker 1>years just to the government suspending </v>
<v Speaker 1>them temporarily,</v>

10
00:00:42.501 --> 00:00:45.770
<v Speaker 1>but even after this protests continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanians role,</v>

11
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.100
<v Speaker 1>the used to living in Europe's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt country,</v>

12
00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.640
<v Speaker 1>and this ignominious decree was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>final straw that broke the camel's back.</v>

13
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.770
<v Speaker 1>But the big question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they get to this point?</v>

14
00:00:54.771 --> 00:00:55.604
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on in a country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could make its governments passed this </v>

15
00:00:58.101 --> 00:01:00.920
<v Speaker 1>cleans of law without feeling any sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of shape?</v>

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer this </v>

17
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:04.250
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we do that.</v>

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The European,</v>

19
00:01:10.771 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

20
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:12.153
<v Speaker 2>Maria,</v>

21
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 1>understand Romanian history without </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowing it out,</v>

22
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Nicolae Ceausescu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European,</v>

23
00:01:17.291 --> 00:01:18.124
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now other neighboring countries like </v>

24
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 1>Hungary or Bulgaria have suffered </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist dictatorships too.</v>

25
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.970
<v Speaker 1>But the story of Romania is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>special since Ceausescu came to power in</v>

26
00:01:32.971 --> 00:01:33.804
<v Speaker 1>1974,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his country has been isolated from the </v>

27
00:01:35.941 --> 00:01:38.460
<v Speaker 1>rest and even from the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

28
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 1>Can even food started to become scary.</v>

29
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.043
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

30
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.430
<v Speaker 1>While citizens had the meals rations by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state Ceausescu,</v>

31
00:01:46.431 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 1>it spends money building Pharaoh's </v>
<v Speaker 1>palaces.</v>

32
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.340
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is the parliaments of Bucharest.</v>

33
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.183
<v Speaker 1>The built in 1983 ends and names of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest administrative building in the </v>

34
00:01:55.401 --> 00:01:56.234
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially amazing if we take </v>

35
00:01:58.941 --> 00:01:59.774
<v Speaker 1>into account is that the Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 1>population is no bigger than 22 million </v>

36
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:06.110
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants during the construction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the building.</v>

37
00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.350
<v Speaker 1>More than 20,000 people were employed in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reynolds.</v>

38
00:02:09.351 --> 00:02:12.700
<v Speaker 1>3,000 died of exhaustion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

39
00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>Ceausescu forced as citizens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in parades and massive shows</v>

40
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.010
<v Speaker 1>to praise his own image.</v>

41
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500
<v Speaker 3>Are they chicken activist?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I've met yet.</v>

42
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.880
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

43
00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.713
<v Speaker 1>just like is North Korea and comrades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ceausescu was a master in the art of </v>

44
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>political repression during the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

45
00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:46.110
<v Speaker 1>an estimate of one in every 30 Romanians</v>
<v Speaker 1>along stevie political police.</v>

46
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:51.020
<v Speaker 1>It could be a neighbor your or anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>really leaning any solid.</v>

47
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.873
<v Speaker 1>You said something bad about the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could end up spending the rest of </v>

48
00:02:55.121 --> 00:02:59.170
<v Speaker 1>your days in jail simply just disappear </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless,</v>

49
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.820
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this being a dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not a safe.</v>

50
00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:03.783
<v Speaker 2>Joel</v>

51
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:07.783
<v Speaker 1>footage is from Ceausescu's last speech </v>
<v Speaker 1>which took place on the 21st of </v>

52
00:03:10.971 --> 00:03:13.130
<v Speaker 1>December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1989 look good.</v>

53
00:03:13.131 --> 00:03:16.220
<v Speaker 1>His facial expression and how it starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>to tremble.</v>

54
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.160
<v Speaker 1>It was at this moment the audience </v>
<v Speaker 1>started</v>

55
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:20.503
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>

56
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 1>This is how the biggest protest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian history started.</v>

57
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.913
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of citizens stepped out on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>streets with national flags or the </v>

58
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.933
<v Speaker 1>Communists symbols had been cut out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three days later on Christmas Day of </v>

59
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>that year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nikolai,</v>

60
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>coca school died next to his wife,</v>
<v Speaker 1>killed by his own party colleagues.</v>

61
00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:47.240
<v Speaker 1>His last words were history will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering,</v>

62
00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:54.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens next?</v>

63
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.870
<v Speaker 1>The truth is in such an oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime is Ceausescu's.</v>

64
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.760
<v Speaker 1>There were no opposition leaders </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>

65
00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.060
<v Speaker 1>Just to make a comparison in Poland's </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the communist regime fell,</v>

66
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.270
<v Speaker 1>there were powerful leaders like Les </v>
<v Speaker 1>Waylay,</v>

67
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:10.530
<v Speaker 1>some popular support and helps write a </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new constitution for the country.</v>

68
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:11.513
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you think succeeded Ceausescu in </v>

69
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Romania?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 1>what would be his own party comrades </v>
<v Speaker 1>more?</v>

71
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be the man who you see on the</v>

72
00:04:19.561 --> 00:04:20.394
<v Speaker 1>screen now and his name is young.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this government was not willing </v>

73
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:33.030
<v Speaker 1>to give up the luxuries that they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>during Ceausescu's times,</v>

74
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.200
<v Speaker 1>so I was always happens in cases like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

75
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.470
<v Speaker 1>The Romanian regime changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a little,</v>

76
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.363
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new constitution allow the other </v>

77
00:04:41.691 --> 00:04:42.524
<v Speaker 1>parties to run for elections and the old</v>
<v Speaker 1>communist party changed its name to the </v>

78
00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:47.623
<v Speaker 1>Social Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the high ranking officials that </v>

79
00:04:48.681 --> 00:04:49.514
<v Speaker 1>ruled the country during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship caps that power during the </v>

80
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:55.820
<v Speaker 1>19 nineties and two thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you probably know,</v>

81
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 1>if power corrupts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute power corrupts absolutely.</v>

82
00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>That's understanding of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1995,</v>

83
00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:10.060
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the Polish economy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>already in private hands.</v>

84
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.680
<v Speaker 1>But in Romania this figure was only 35 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

85
00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:16.450
<v Speaker 1>So that's something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an example,</v>

86
00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.340
<v Speaker 1>let's take two common terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia had a state owned factory</v>

87
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.203
<v Speaker 1>Skoda that was privatized in 1992.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By sharing the ownership among the </v>

88
00:05:26.261 --> 00:05:28.330
<v Speaker 1>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Romanian counterpart.</v>

89
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:33.370
<v Speaker 1>Dacia was not privatized until 1997 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of doing it by sharing it,</v>

90
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>it was simply sold to Renner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

91
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:37.780
<v Speaker 1>during the nineties and the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>

92
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:38.633
<v Speaker 1>the ruling elite in Romania did whatever</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could in order to keep control of </v>

93
00:05:42.311 --> 00:05:43.144
<v Speaker 1>the economy and the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was only through these actions that </v>

94
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.791
<v Speaker 1>they were able to keep a hold on that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>

95
00:05:58.201 --> 00:06:01.020
<v Speaker 1>just a second tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because corruption was presence at lower</v>

96
00:06:01.021 --> 00:06:04.590
<v Speaker 1>levels as well in the country that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>been so used to scarcity,</v>

97
00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.520
<v Speaker 1>it was impossible to get anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>without a little brian.</v>

98
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:10.080
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to the doctor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:06:10.081 --> 00:06:14.070
<v Speaker 1>bring a box of cigarettes with you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what about to have electricity at home?</v>

100
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.103
<v Speaker 1>A whiskey bottle bends everything sorted</v>
<v Speaker 1>out and that is how in this country </v>

101
00:06:18.751 --> 00:06:20.390
<v Speaker 1>corruption became a way of life</v>

102
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:21.360
<v Speaker 2>life.</v>

103
00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:25.803
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really possible for a country to </v>

104
00:06:28.391 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>work this way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is well no.</v>

105
00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:34.790
<v Speaker 1>Remaining and saw how the former </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist republic,</v>

106
00:06:34.791 --> 00:06:36.700
<v Speaker 1>such as the Czech Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland,</v>

107
00:06:36.701 --> 00:06:41.080
<v Speaker 1>started enjoying a western standard of </v>
<v Speaker 1>living while they kept surviving on less</v>

108
00:06:41.081 --> 00:06:41.914
<v Speaker 1>than $400 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why in the middle of 2000 </v>

109
00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:45.463
<v Speaker 1>Romania requested you become a member of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union so that they could </v>

110
00:06:48.831 --> 00:06:49.664
<v Speaker 1>get access to some of those sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet EU funds and Brussels basically </v>

111
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.710
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay man,</v>

112
00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:55.603
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's one condition and that </v>

113
00:06:57.921 --> 00:06:58.754
<v Speaker 1>condition was the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>anticorruption directorate in the year </v>

114
00:07:05.231 --> 00:07:06.064
<v Speaker 1>2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Romanian government founded an </v>

115
00:07:07.781 --> 00:07:08.614
<v Speaker 1>agency to chase corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The national anticorruption direct </v>

116
00:07:11.831 --> 00:07:12.664
<v Speaker 1>service for its best few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This agency was directed by prosecutors </v>

117
00:07:16.091 --> 00:07:16.924
<v Speaker 1>connected to the party leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this was basically the Romanian way </v>

118
00:07:19.661 --> 00:07:20.494
<v Speaker 1>of saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

119
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:22.410
<v Speaker 1>look at us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're doing great liquid.</v>

120
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:25.450
<v Speaker 1>All this corruption we're tackling with </v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaning up everything.</v>

121
00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not surprisingly,</v>

122
00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:32.791
<v Speaker 1>nothing changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was until the year 2013,</v>

123
00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.960
<v Speaker 1>that is the year when a woman came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Leeds,</v>

124
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:40.794
<v Speaker 1>the director of risk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a women ready to face everything and </v>

125
00:07:43.570 --> 00:07:47.760
<v Speaker 1>every one and her name is Laura Cod.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Router pervasy</v>

126
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.090
<v Speaker 1>seemed to have been impressed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities of the DNA.</v>

127
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:58.133
<v Speaker 1>According to one recent poll,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60 percent of people said they trusted </v>

128
00:08:00.901 --> 00:08:01.734
<v Speaker 1>the agency while only 11 percent say </v>
<v Speaker 1>they trusted problem in just two years </v>

129
00:08:05.731 --> 00:08:08.030
<v Speaker 1>because they see his jails more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>1000.</v>

130
00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:11.540
<v Speaker 1>100 politicians accused of corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>during these years.</v>

131
00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:12.413
<v Speaker 1>Romanians have discovered all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty things that ruling class were </v>

132
00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:19.710
<v Speaker 1>hiding and these are no small things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to an estimate,</v>

133
00:08:19.711 --> 00:08:24.090
<v Speaker 1>corruption accounts for 15 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian GDP.</v>

134
00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Virtually all the public sales had some </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of running involved.</v>

135
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Even the Microsoft licenses that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil servants used has a cost of over </v>

136
00:08:32.521 --> 00:08:33.780
<v Speaker 1>$3,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars,</v>

137
00:08:33.781 --> 00:08:37.020
<v Speaker 1>which we use to pay bribes to different </v>
<v Speaker 1>government officials.</v>

138
00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:43.033
<v Speaker 1>Then there was the case of a judge who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was paint around $700,000 in order to </v>

139
00:08:46.611 --> 00:08:51.320
<v Speaker 1>declare someone innocent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was actually guilty and this list,</v>

140
00:08:51.321 --> 00:08:52.154
<v Speaker 1>it just goes on and on and on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't want to make that the rest </v>

141
00:08:54.231 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 1>of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since the year 2013,</v>

142
00:08:57.031 --> 00:08:57.864
<v Speaker 1>basically all of these criminals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been filling up the Romanian </v>

143
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.924
<v Speaker 1>jails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the point that some of the prisons </v>

144
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.474
<v Speaker 1>have no space anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that Romanian society </v>

145
00:09:06.631 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>itself has started to realize just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging corruption is,</v>

146
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:15.180
<v Speaker 1>but the real turning points came a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little bit later with this news.</v>

147
00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:18.113
<v Speaker 1>Armenian nightclub fire leaves 27 dead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This news triggered a wave of protests </v>

148
00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:23.663
<v Speaker 1>all across Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently this could have been avoided </v>

149
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:29.160
<v Speaker 1>if the club would have met safety </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>

150
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:31.860
<v Speaker 1>That seems the owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red bribes the local authorities.</v>

151
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:34.590
<v Speaker 1>He could open the club without breaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rules.</v>

152
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:35.453
<v Speaker 1>This is how a platform came to be called</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corrupted cheat day or corruption </v>

153
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:40.254
<v Speaker 1>kills in English through social media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian started to organize themselves </v>

154
00:09:44.161 --> 00:09:46.830
<v Speaker 1>in protest groups against corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

155
00:09:46.831 --> 00:09:49.470
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on for a minute because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

156
00:09:49.471 --> 00:09:50.304
<v Speaker 1>It's really yet to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest demonstrations in Romanian </v>

157
00:09:56.271 --> 00:09:59.870
<v Speaker 1>history on January the 18th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 at 10:00 PM.</v>

158
00:09:59.871 --> 00:10:03.320
<v Speaker 1>The social democratic government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's prime minister does or in grinned.</v>

159
00:10:03.321 --> 00:10:06.500
<v Speaker 1>Deanna passed an emergency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Pan's.</v>

160
00:10:06.501 --> 00:10:07.334
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did do it at night when everyone </v>

161
00:10:08.691 --> 00:10:12.500
<v Speaker 1>was about to go to bed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did this decrease say?</v>

162
00:10:12.770 --> 00:10:13.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said the politicians who accepted </v>

163
00:10:14.811 --> 00:10:19.280
<v Speaker 1>bribes for less than 44,000 euros did </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have to face jail time,</v>

164
00:10:19.281 --> 00:10:22.100
<v Speaker 1>more pay any fines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing at all.</v>

165
00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:25.820
<v Speaker 1>It was absolutely fine with the law to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be bribed up to that.</v>

166
00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:26.843
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

167
00:10:29.400 --> 00:10:32.400
<v Speaker 1>It should also be noted that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed this little welder beating the</v>

168
00:10:32.401 --> 00:10:36.120
<v Speaker 1>national budget as normal so no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>would notice the change.</v>

169
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:40.800
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering who can </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly data passed such a law.</v>

170
00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:41.753
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what could possibly be the official </v>

171
00:10:43.351 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 1>reason behind the decriminalization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>embroidery?</v>

172
00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the reason given by the Romanian</v>

173
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:49.944
<v Speaker 1>prime minister</v>

174
00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.900
<v Speaker 1>wants to pass the ordinances into law to</v>
<v Speaker 1>ease overcrowding in prisons.</v>

175
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:57.883
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the actual reason given by the </v>

176
00:11:00.621 --> 00:11:03.830
<v Speaker 1>Romanian government and Bam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

177
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Over 3000 corrupt politicians could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>freed and he has.</v>

178
00:11:07.650 --> 00:11:08.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that remaining jails were </v>

179
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:10.223
<v Speaker 1>overcrowded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in a country where money is drained </v>

180
00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:12.644
<v Speaker 1>from the system by bribery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be too difficult to find </v>

181
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.810
<v Speaker 1>new funds for new prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

182
00:11:17.811 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the majority of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>generals,</v>

183
00:11:19.491 --> 00:11:21.240
<v Speaker 1>politicians belong to the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass.</v>

184
00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 1>It does make it slightly more </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious.</v>

185
00:11:24.201 --> 00:11:25.970
<v Speaker 1>Date your thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

186
00:11:25.971 --> 00:11:26.804
<v Speaker 1>half a million Romanians thought so too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they took to the streets of </v>

187
00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.930
<v Speaker 1>Bucharest to minutes after the decree </v>
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>

188
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:34.610
<v Speaker 2>People will feel that they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheated,</v>

189
00:11:34.611 --> 00:11:35.580
<v Speaker 2>that David</v>

190
00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.740
<v Speaker 1>obviously established corruption kills </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

191
00:11:38.741 --> 00:11:39.574
<v Speaker 1>Its citizens learned about this news </v>
<v Speaker 1>instantly and boy they did not like it </v>

192
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.434
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is how the biggest protest in </v>

193
00:11:46.361 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Romanian streets.</v>

194
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>I never dare to think that</v>

195
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.843
<v Speaker 1>this was possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've always thought there was some </v>

196
00:11:56.561 --> 00:11:57.394
<v Speaker 1>logic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some commonsense that would lead to a </v>

197
00:11:58.841 --> 00:12:01.510
<v Speaker 1>valid law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when I saw what happened,</v>

198
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:05.680
<v Speaker 1>I knew I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protest kept going for days,</v>

199
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:08.950
<v Speaker 1>not only in Bucharest about in most </v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian cities,</v>

200
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:09.813
<v Speaker 1>the first victim of the unrest was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice minister who was forced to </v>

201
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:15.490
<v Speaker 1>resign on the ninth of February 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned,</v>

202
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:18.370
<v Speaker 1>the protests led to the government to </v>
<v Speaker 1>retiring this new law.</v>

203
00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Although they have already admitted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just temporary.</v>

204
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:22.353
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the brand new justice minister to </v>

205
00:12:23.441 --> 00:12:24.274
<v Speaker 1>derailed soda has a clear mission to </v>
<v Speaker 1>justifying the firing of the general </v>

206
00:12:27.881 --> 00:12:28.714
<v Speaker 1>prosecutor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laura could recheck a basing women who </v>

207
00:12:30.810 --> 00:12:31.643
<v Speaker 1>are jailed over 1000 politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government claimed that her agency </v>

208
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:35.914
<v Speaker 1>is running a witch hunt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they still haven't found a way to </v>

209
00:12:38.861 --> 00:12:41.020
<v Speaker 1>legally far her yet</v>

210
00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:48.840
<v Speaker 1>valuating constitutionality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legality and opportunity factors.</v>

211
00:12:48.930 --> 00:12:49.763
<v Speaker 1>I determined that at the moment it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>advisable to start the institutional </v>

212
00:12:53.971 --> 00:12:58.650
<v Speaker 1>mechanism to revoke the general </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecutor and the DNA chief prosecutor.</v>

213
00:12:58.780 --> 00:12:59.613
<v Speaker 1>At the same time Grimsey all news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government is confronted going to </v>

214
00:13:01.720 --> 00:13:03.460
<v Speaker 1>different sites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

215
00:13:03.461 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>civil society is surveying his </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements.</v>

216
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.453
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union is demanding that he </v>

217
00:13:08.201 --> 00:13:09.034
<v Speaker 1>stopped at striking the anticorruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecutor and of course all of the </v>

218
00:13:11.831 --> 00:13:12.664
<v Speaker 1>political elite inheritors of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ceausescu's regime are turning to </v>

219
00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:19.090
<v Speaker 1>classic conspiracy theories do protect </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves according to them,</v>

220
00:13:19.091 --> 00:13:24.040
<v Speaker 1>George Soros and the Rothschild family </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the protesters and they say,</v>

221
00:13:24.041 --> 00:13:24.874
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that corruption is not actually a big </v>

222
00:13:26.741 --> 00:13:28.210
<v Speaker 1>deal in Romania at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

223
00:13:28.211 --> 00:13:29.044
<v Speaker 1>with or without conspiracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are still talking about an </v>

224
00:13:30.911 --> 00:13:33.820
<v Speaker 1>existential crisis in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poorest</v>

225
00:13:33.860 --> 00:13:34.693
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

226
00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:41.293
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think Romania should jail all of </v>

227
00:13:43.461 --> 00:13:44.294
<v Speaker 1>their corrupted politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think that instead the prime </v>

228
00:13:45.861 --> 00:13:49.400
<v Speaker 1>minister is actually doing something </v>
<v Speaker 1>right by Ge criminalizing bribery?</v>
