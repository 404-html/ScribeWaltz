1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

2
00:00:01.621 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Do you when?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:05.520
<v Speaker 1>to all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear view is a visual politic.</v>

4
00:00:05.521 --> 00:00:10.521
<v Speaker 1>It may have gone unnoticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is a historical events.</v>

5
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.160
<v Speaker 1>This not for the first time in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire history of humanity.</v>

6
00:00:14.161 --> 00:00:17.070
<v Speaker 1>We live in a world where poverty no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer effect.</v>

7
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Most of the population surprised</v>

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:24.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

9
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.263
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be here or visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already told you that this was </v>

10
00:00:27.791 --> 00:00:29.230
<v Speaker 1>about to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks today,</v>

11
00:00:29.231 --> 00:00:30.064
<v Speaker 1>let's forget all about the apocalyptic </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspectives that we've covered for so </v>

12
00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:35.223
<v Speaker 1>many years about the world we live in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that today on our planet's </v>

13
00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.793
<v Speaker 1>most of the population either belongs to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle class or do the wealthiest </v>

14
00:00:41.741 --> 00:00:42.574
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>

15
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.860
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.330
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>

17
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:52.331
<v Speaker 1>poverty is now not such a looming issue </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is still a lot of poverty,</v>

18
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:53.684
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that we've never before</v>
<v Speaker 1>known a world where poverty didn't </v>

19
00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:00.980
<v Speaker 1>affect most of the population and don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me that that's not great news,</v>

20
00:01:00.981 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a second because some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you might be asking some questions in</v>

21
00:01:04.761 --> 00:01:06.530
<v Speaker 1>your mind right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

22
00:01:06.531 --> 00:01:08.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what on earth are you talking about,</v>

23
00:01:08.271 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 1>Simon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you mean exactly?</v>

24
00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.980
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is everyone so pessimistic?</v>

25
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.160
<v Speaker 1>Or maybe you're even asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all of this sustainable?</v>

26
00:01:16.161 --> 00:01:19.340
<v Speaker 1>Can the environments with the such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy burden?</v>

27
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.233
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have perhaps on the threshold of the </v>

28
00:01:21.861 --> 00:01:23.900
<v Speaker 1>world's very destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:23.901 --> 00:01:27.260
<v Speaker 1>we're going to explore all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions in today's video.</v>

30
00:01:27.261 --> 00:01:28.094
<v Speaker 1>So that's up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general impression of most people </v>

31
00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:41.313
<v Speaker 1>you can't deny it is that we live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world full of misery of inequality or </v>

32
00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>injustice and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that does exist,</v>

33
00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.720
<v Speaker 1>but fortunately it's becoming less </v>
<v Speaker 1>frequent.</v>

34
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 3>Just one area or with just one plane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Monday,</v>

35
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.970
<v Speaker 3>a battery fire in an auxiliary power </v>
<v Speaker 3>unit in the belly of the plane.</v>

36
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.160
<v Speaker 1>Right now it's rated as very unhealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the US embassy monitoring site.</v>

37
00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.173
<v Speaker 1>Extraordinary snake of trash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean literally it rolls around the </v>

38
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:13.220
<v Speaker 1>hillside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

39
00:02:13.221 --> 00:02:16.220
<v Speaker 1>every time you turn on the TV or your </v>
<v Speaker 1>visit a news website,</v>

40
00:02:16.221 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 1>you'll find catastrophes of all sorts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds.</v>

41
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:20.613
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't usually find much good news </v>

42
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:25.500
<v Speaker 1>even though this is the kind that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>generally much more</v>

43
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:26.563
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

44
00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.073
<v Speaker 1>You'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the Brookings Institute in </v>

45
00:02:31.231 --> 00:02:32.700
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>datalabs estimates,</v>

46
00:02:32.701 --> 00:02:33.534
<v Speaker 1>we hit an extraordinary milestone this </v>
<v Speaker 1>past September of 2018 for the first </v>

47
00:02:37.831 --> 00:02:38.664
<v Speaker 1>time in the history of mankind to most </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who live in the world are no </v>

48
00:02:42.571 --> 00:02:44.910
<v Speaker 1>longer poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about more than 50 percent</v>

49
00:02:44.911 --> 00:02:45.744
<v Speaker 1>of the world's population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Approximately three point 8 billion </v>

50
00:02:47.791 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>people who belong to a middle class or </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy homes.</v>

51
00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:51.683
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the rough distribution of the </v>

52
00:02:53.221 --> 00:02:54.810
<v Speaker 1>world's population today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so</v>

53
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.123
<v Speaker 2>bounce.</v>

54
00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you might be wondering,</v>

55
00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:06.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly do you mean by middle class</v>

56
00:03:06.391 --> 00:03:09.050
<v Speaker 1>time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:09.051 --> 00:03:11.660
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally this is people with enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>purchasing power.</v>

58
00:03:11.661 --> 00:03:12.494
<v Speaker 1>Do you allow them to live comfortably?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is they can buy washing machines </v>

59
00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:16.664
<v Speaker 1>and refrigerators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can go to restaurants and they can </v>

60
00:03:18.441 --> 00:03:19.274
<v Speaker 1>go on vacation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can endure some unexpected </v>

61
00:03:21.231 --> 00:03:22.064
<v Speaker 1>instability such as an illness or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of unemployment without falling </v>

62
00:03:25.461 --> 00:03:26.180
<v Speaker 1>back into</v>

63
00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.013
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

64
00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.893
<v Speaker 1>To be more specific for this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies offers the households that have </v>

65
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>a consumption capacity of more than $11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>per day per person that just did for the</v>

66
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>price level are part of the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

67
00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.033
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

68
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.620
<v Speaker 1>That is not all the best is yet to come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That allow me to explain.</v>

69
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.533
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot of poverty in the </v>

70
00:03:48.501 --> 00:03:49.334
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No less than 650 million people live in </v>

71
00:03:51.351 --> 00:03:52.184
<v Speaker 1>extreme poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They aren't even guaranteed the most </v>

72
00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:58.400
<v Speaker 1>basic things like food and of course 650</v>
<v Speaker 1>million people is far too.</v>

73
00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:02.423
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that changes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening so quickly that in the next </v>

74
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>few decades this issue may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared entirely,</v>

75
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.300
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.120
<v Speaker 1>how fast are we really talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>

77
00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:12.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you an idea of how fast things </v>

78
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>are changing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out these figures</v>

79
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:22.890
<v Speaker 1>in all wells for every second that </v>
<v Speaker 1>passes,</v>

80
00:04:22.891 --> 00:04:26.700
<v Speaker 1>one person escapes extreme poverty every</v>
<v Speaker 1>single second.</v>

81
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 1>It is exactly this lightening fast rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>that has caused the population living in</v>

82
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:35.631
<v Speaker 1>conditions of extreme poverty to fall by</v>
<v Speaker 1>75 percent from 1990 to 2015,</v>

83
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.200
<v Speaker 1>but even with this news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without a doubt,</v>

84
00:04:40.201 --> 00:04:41.034
<v Speaker 1>what's most surprising is what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with the middle class in that </v>

85
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:45.960
<v Speaker 1>same period of time that is every single</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

86
00:04:45.961 --> 00:04:50.670
<v Speaker 1>approximately five people leave poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind and join the middle class.</v>

87
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.623
<v Speaker 1>Five people per seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That folks means that if this rate </v>

88
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.730
<v Speaker 1>continues in just 12 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the year 20,</v>

89
00:04:56.731 --> 00:04:57.950
<v Speaker 1>30,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middleclass,</v>

90
00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.140
<v Speaker 1>who would make up the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's popular</v>

91
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 2>good</v>

92
00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:11.720
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you agree?</v>

93
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:12.683
<v Speaker 1>The middle class would mean a world with</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer poor people with a greater </v>

94
00:05:15.531 --> 00:05:19.220
<v Speaker 1>commitment to academic studies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge with a greater tendency to set</v>

95
00:05:19.221 --> 00:05:20.054
<v Speaker 1>up companies and also a population </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's more demanding towards </v>

96
00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:24.260
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among other things.</v>

97
00:05:24.261 --> 00:05:26.750
<v Speaker 1>This is because the middle class is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>proprietary class.</v>

98
00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:28.280
<v Speaker 1>People in the middle of class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have houses,</v>

99
00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:29.114
<v Speaker 1>they have savings businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that of course it leads them to be </v>

100
00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.700
<v Speaker 1>more committed to stability and to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more demanding.</v>

101
00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:41.640
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've told you many times,</v>

102
00:05:41.641 --> 00:05:42.474
<v Speaker 1>this huge growth means another thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of opportunities </v>

103
00:05:46.111 --> 00:05:47.190
<v Speaker 1>for enterprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

104
00:05:47.191 --> 00:05:48.024
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a moment and here's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question that many of you may be asking </v>

105
00:05:50.611 --> 00:05:51.444
<v Speaker 1>yourselves and we know you're asking it </v>
<v Speaker 1>because we see asking in the comments </v>

106
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:54.893
<v Speaker 1>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can our weld support so many consuming </v>

107
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.830
<v Speaker 1>such a large amount of stuff?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aren't we really sowing the seeds of our</v>

108
00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>destruction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:09.820
<v Speaker 1>let's see a path to the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate Change,</v>

110
00:06:17.471 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 1>mass extinction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water pollution.</v>

111
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:20.880
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't even have to say,</v>

112
00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:23.170
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are facing many challenges.</v>

113
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:25.510
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we take a look at the news,</v>

114
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.373
<v Speaker 1>we could get the impression that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>heading full speed towards some sort of </v>

115
00:06:29.231 --> 00:06:30.064
<v Speaker 1>precipice and of course with so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people consuming more and more </v>

116
00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's normal for our lives to be pervaded</v>

117
00:06:35.501 --> 00:06:37.690
<v Speaker 1>by the question of what's going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to the planet.</v>

118
00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:45.390
<v Speaker 1>But what if it wasn't exactly like that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if after a certain level,</v>

119
00:06:45.391 --> 00:06:46.224
<v Speaker 1>the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments and wealth actually became </v>

120
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.831
<v Speaker 1>positive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

121
00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:50.664
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the direction that things are </v>

122
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:53.220
<v Speaker 1>actually moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

123
00:06:53.221 --> 00:06:54.054
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about development and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth and consumption to </v>

124
00:06:56.881 --> 00:06:57.714
<v Speaker 1>issues logically concern us a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is pollution and damage to the </v>

125
00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second is whether or not there's</v>

126
00:07:04.111 --> 00:07:06.090
<v Speaker 1>going to be enough resources for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

127
00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:06.983
<v Speaker 1>So let's start with the first one first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible that things aren't going </v>

128
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:13.020
<v Speaker 1>to go down such a bad path?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look.</v>

129
00:07:13.021 --> 00:07:13.854
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in recent years in the </v>

130
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:18.300
<v Speaker 1>largest economies on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that is the United States,</v>

131
00:07:18.301 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and Japan.</v>

132
00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:26.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:27.323
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>63.</v>

134
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:28.173
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen states issued zero point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>four kilograms of co two for every </v>

135
00:07:31.221 --> 00:07:35.690
<v Speaker 1>dollar of production in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This value was just point three four,</v>

136
00:07:35.691 --> 00:07:36.524
<v Speaker 1>which is 64 percent less for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called the European Union reduced </v>

137
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:40.513
<v Speaker 1>co two emissions per dollar of </v>
<v Speaker 1>production by 54 percent between 1991 </v>

138
00:07:43.761 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>and 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the same is true of Japan,</v>

139
00:07:46.370 --> 00:07:47.203
<v Speaker 1>even China or infamous China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country that used coal for </v>

140
00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:51.223
<v Speaker 1>everything has reduced its relative co </v>
<v Speaker 1>two emissions by 75 percent over the </v>

141
00:07:55.461 --> 00:07:56.294
<v Speaker 1>past four decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say technological </v>

142
00:07:58.251 --> 00:07:59.084
<v Speaker 1>developments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And New environments or concerns are </v>

143
00:08:00.801 --> 00:08:04.670
<v Speaker 1>helping the world produce more policing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last,</v>

144
00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.870
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

145
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:10.703
<v Speaker 1>You heard the absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Improved technology and increasing </v>

146
00:08:13.471 --> 00:08:14.304
<v Speaker 1>concern for the environments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>managing to slow down and even reverse </v>

147
00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.510
<v Speaker 1>the damage to our planet's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at the United States,</v>

148
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:24.450
<v Speaker 4>Dannon,</v>
<v Speaker 4>again,</v>

149
00:08:24.540 --> 00:08:25.373
<v Speaker 4>environmental improvements once deemed </v>
<v Speaker 4>impossible have taken place since 1970 </v>

150
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 4>when the environmental protection agency</v>
<v Speaker 4>was established.</v>

151
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:36.540
<v Speaker 4>United States has slashed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It's a missions have five air pollutants</v>

152
00:08:36.541 --> 00:08:38.630
<v Speaker 4>by almost two thirds over the same </v>
<v Speaker 4>period.</v>

153
00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:39.533
<v Speaker 4>The population grew by more than 40 </v>
<v Speaker 4>percent and those people drove twice as </v>

154
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:45.690
<v Speaker 4>many miles and became two and a half </v>
<v Speaker 4>times Richard Steven pinker.</v>

155
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.490
<v Speaker 1>The truth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks is that it's becoming increasingly</v>

156
00:08:48.491 --> 00:08:49.324
<v Speaker 1>clear that the relationship between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environments and wealth has an inverted </v>

157
00:08:52.721 --> 00:08:53.554
<v Speaker 1>u shape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say after a determined level </v>

158
00:08:56.041 --> 00:08:56.874
<v Speaker 1>of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>societies begin to worry more about the </v>

159
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.560
<v Speaker 1>environments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They begin to take measures to take care</v>

160
00:09:01.561 --> 00:09:02.394
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they begin to develop and use clean </v>

161
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:05.303
<v Speaker 1>technologies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renewable energies will dominate the </v>

162
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:08.994
<v Speaker 1>future German electricity sector thanks </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the impulse of offshore wind and </v>

163
00:09:12.871 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>geothermal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

164
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:15.204
<v Speaker 1>this is what the environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance index an index constructed </v>

165
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:22.290
<v Speaker 1>from metrics that measure the quality of</v>
<v Speaker 1>our water forest and natural inhabitants</v>

166
00:09:22.291 --> 00:09:25.830
<v Speaker 1>indicates out of the 180 countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make up the index,</v>

167
00:09:26.310 --> 00:09:29.640
<v Speaker 1>but to have improved in the last decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

168
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:33.120
<v Speaker 1>the index shows that the richer a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is on average,</v>

169
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:37.590
<v Speaker 1>the cleaner it's environments becomes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more environmental awareness and</v>

170
00:09:37.591 --> 00:09:39.830
<v Speaker 1>so it gets better results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

171
00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we think about it,</v>

172
00:09:40.950 --> 00:09:41.783
<v Speaker 1>it's really quite logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richer countries can allocate more </v>

173
00:09:43.891 --> 00:09:44.724
<v Speaker 1>resources towards technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments and protecting natural </v>

174
00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 1>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

175
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:49.434
<v Speaker 1>since 1990,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the world has become richer and </v>

176
00:09:50.941 --> 00:09:53.460
<v Speaker 1>richer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protected areas have almost doubled.</v>

177
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.443
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 15 percent of the surface of </v>

178
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>the planet is protected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>

179
00:09:58.530 --> 00:09:59.363
<v Speaker 1>the forestation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great ecological threats is </v>

180
00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:06.320
<v Speaker 1>undergoing a clear decline deforestation</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the world's largest tropical forest.</v>

181
00:10:07.200 --> 00:10:12.200
<v Speaker 1>The Amazon peaked in 1995 and from 2004 </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 2013,</v>

182
00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 1>the rate fell by four fifths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steven pinker,</v>

183
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.073
<v Speaker 1>when the laundry middle class will mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>more resources to care for the </v>

184
00:10:18.211 --> 00:10:19.044
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more people developing cleaner </v>

185
00:10:20.131 --> 00:10:23.250
<v Speaker 1>technologies and a greater level of </v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental awareness.</v>

186
00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.150
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>

187
00:10:24.151 --> 00:10:24.984
<v Speaker 1>there are many challenges ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the trend isn't nearly bad as often </v>

188
00:10:27.901 --> 00:10:28.734
<v Speaker 1>portrayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really need to take our </v>

189
00:10:30.151 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>foot off the gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do need to promote cleaner production</v>

190
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:33.654
<v Speaker 1>methods and technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not in an apocalyptic or </v>

191
00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 1>irreversible situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bands,</v>

192
00:10:38.311 --> 00:10:40.140
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the empirical evidence tells us that the</v>

193
00:10:40.141 --> 00:10:40.974
<v Speaker 1>best way to overcome these challenges is</v>
<v Speaker 1>with more investments ends with richer </v>

194
00:10:44.370 --> 00:10:45.203
<v Speaker 1>and better formed societies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regarding the second question as to </v>

195
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:53.110
<v Speaker 1>whether natural resources will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exhausted on Austin,</v>

196
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.953
<v Speaker 1>I think we can rest assured that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't be not so many because there are </v>

197
00:10:57.061 --> 00:10:58.830
<v Speaker 1>many resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but above all,</v>

198
00:10:58.831 --> 00:11:01.980
<v Speaker 1>because human activity aims to seek </v>
<v Speaker 1>better ways of production,</v>

199
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:02.843
<v Speaker 1>including recycling the development of </v>
<v Speaker 1>new technologies that allow for the </v>

200
00:11:05.491 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 1>exploitation of new resources for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to do more.</v>

201
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.563
<v Speaker 1>With</v>

202
00:11:11.990 --> 00:11:13.550
<v Speaker 1>all of these reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't worry,</v>

203
00:11:13.551 --> 00:11:16.010
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk much more about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>topic in the future.</v>

204
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:20.330
<v Speaker 1>I think we have to be more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied that for the first time in the</v>

205
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.253
<v Speaker 1>history of humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our average condition isn't poverty or </v>

206
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 1>hunger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

207
00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:26.833
<v Speaker 1>humanity is managing to defeat poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I really hope you enjoyed that </v>
