00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever wondered how a country can</v>
<v Speaker 1>be hijacked,</v>

2
00:00:02.911 --> 00:00:03.744
<v Speaker 1>how institutions can be subjective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>averted and corrupted and perhaps most </v>

3
00:00:07.321 --> 00:00:10.260
<v Speaker 1>importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you identify the moments in which</v>

4
00:00:10.261 --> 00:00:13.050
<v Speaker 1>a democracy after being taken over stops</v>
<v Speaker 1>working?</v>

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Their view of those questions have </v>
<v Speaker 1>pervaded global politics,</v>

6
00:00:16.291 --> 00:00:19.620
<v Speaker 1>butts especially they've pervaded Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>American politics.</v>

7
00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:20.793
<v Speaker 2>I can do that here on my needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has been put in my name [inaudible] </v>

8
00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 2>and peanut butter on it.</v>

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.943
<v Speaker 1>Last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>numerous last and American leaders of </v>

12
00:00:52.541 --> 00:00:56.920
<v Speaker 1>taking control of their countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they did it through Kuda Taz,</v>

13
00:00:56.921 --> 00:00:57.754
<v Speaker 1>but in many other occasions these </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictators came to power through </v>

14
00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 1>democratic means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is precisely the case of Nicaraguan</v>

15
00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:06.610
<v Speaker 1>President Daniel or Tayga.</v>

16
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.573
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

17

<v Speaker 1>Visual policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already told you about this </v>

18
00:01:12.341 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>political figure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how he came to power,</v>

19
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:15.034
<v Speaker 1>how he behaved and how he was </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the huge strikes that </v>

20
00:01:17.591 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua has been going through in 2018</v>

<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

22
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.163
<v Speaker 1>Strikes that have been answered with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy hands and which have led to </v>

23
00:01:35.351 --> 00:01:36.184
<v Speaker 1>terrible consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 200 people have lost their </v>

24
00:01:38.861 --> 00:01:40.690
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds have been detained.</v>

25
00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.910
<v Speaker 1>Thousands have been injured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:42.911 --> 00:01:43.744
<v Speaker 1>in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a look at another </v>

27
00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:47.560
<v Speaker 1>aspect of the events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

28
00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of how a government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to take control of the state and</v>

29
00:01:51.461 --> 00:01:53.860
<v Speaker 1>make the institutions work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not for the country,</v>

30
00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.723
<v Speaker 1>but for itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the story of how I kinds of </v>

31
00:01:57.371 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 1>political Matthia took control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua,</v>

32
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>so listen up.</v>

33
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.793
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

34
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.053
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 2006 and Daniel Ortega winds the </v>

35
00:02:14.411 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Nicaraguan presidential elections after </v>
<v Speaker 1>16 years as the opposition,</v>

36
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>the Sandinista leader returns to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

37
00:02:20.831 --> 00:02:22.420
<v Speaker 1>his presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the precedents,</v>

38
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>what exactly good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His first time as president between 1985</v>

39
00:02:26.171 --> 00:02:29.320
<v Speaker 1>and 1990 was frankly terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

40
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>go left and economically and socially.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shattered country.</v>

41
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:40.163
<v Speaker 1>It was a company that went through a </v>
<v Speaker 1>warm ended up with a foreign debt six </v>

42
00:02:42.631 --> 00:02:46.230
<v Speaker 1>times bigger than its GDP and suffered </v>
<v Speaker 1>from hyperinflation that are reached the</v>

43
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.064
<v Speaker 1>astronomical figure of 33.547%</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 1987 to give you an idea of the </v>

44
00:02:52.471 --> 00:02:53.304
<v Speaker 1>magnitude of this disaster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1990 the per capita income of </v>

45
00:02:56.161 --> 00:02:56.994
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua was 55% smaller than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country he had registered back in 1978 </v>

46
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 1>in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to Daniel Ortega,</v>

47
00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.420
<v Speaker 1>even the kushners would get good grades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ortega's economic model.</v>

48
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.710
<v Speaker 1>It was a huge failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The expropriations,</v>

49
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:18.544
<v Speaker 1>the gigantic foreign debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the unstoppable money printing and his </v>

50
00:03:22.241 --> 00:03:23.074
<v Speaker 1>obsession with controlling the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>led Nicaragua into an unsustainable </v>

51
00:03:27.461 --> 00:03:28.600
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hands,</v>

52
00:03:28.601 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how wouldn't it of with that recipe,</v>

53
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.910
<v Speaker 1>we has the conscious conflict to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this financed by the United States.</v>

54
00:03:41.911 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 1>The country was submerged in a complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>

55
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:54.533
<v Speaker 3>Bye,</v>

56
00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.230
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For those of you who don't know,</v>

57
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.064
<v Speaker 1>the contracts were paramilitary groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>financed by Washington through selling </v>

58
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:03.040
<v Speaker 1>weapons to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When this country was in the middle of a</v>

59
00:04:03.041 --> 00:04:03.874
<v Speaker 1>walk with Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country that was supposedly close to </v>

60
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>Washington in shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of nonsense.</v>

61
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:09.813
<v Speaker 1>So throughout the following decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country only out of one initiative </v>

62
00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.150
<v Speaker 1>that was simply to recover from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hideous mess.</v>

63
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:17.743
<v Speaker 3>See</v>

64
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the following government,</v>

65
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:32.790
<v Speaker 1>starting with that a violator tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

66
00:04:32.791 --> 00:04:33.624
<v Speaker 1>the first elected female Latin American </v>
<v Speaker 1>president decided to turn the country's </v>

67
00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.244
<v Speaker 1>political and economic approach right </v>
<v Speaker 1>around that is to move from a </v>

68
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.324
<v Speaker 1>centralized economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was organized and directed by the </v>

69
00:04:45.091 --> 00:04:46.220
<v Speaker 1>state to a market.</v>

70
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.550
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>

71
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.560
<v Speaker 1>Salvey Nicaragua and free trade zones </v>
<v Speaker 1>were born now as well as the policies do</v>

72
00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.453
<v Speaker 1>attract foreign investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which along with international </v>

73
00:05:01.591 --> 00:05:02.424
<v Speaker 1>cooperation and especially the growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>remittances from abroad allowed to </v>

74
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:10.311
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua to get back on track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on just a moment because what these</v>

75
00:05:21.431 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>new governments didn't achieve was </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting an end to corruption.</v>

76
00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:29.110
<v Speaker 1>Thus scandal after scans all the feeling</v>
<v Speaker 1>of frustration,</v>

77
00:05:29.111 --> 00:05:29.944
<v Speaker 1>disappointment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and deceit that all Nicaraguans fells </v>

78
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.770
<v Speaker 1>along with an opposition who was willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do almost anything to return to power</v>

79
00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>fueled Ortega's victory in 2006 here few</v>
<v Speaker 1>s is where the new story begins,</v>

80
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:54.400
<v Speaker 1>especially because all Tayga wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to waste as returned to power.</v>

81
00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.890
<v Speaker 1>This was his charms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was his to dominate in Nicaragua,</v>

82
00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:01.190
<v Speaker 1>in politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finances and society,</v>

83
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:02.053
<v Speaker 1>but to achieve this and above all to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent an electoral process from Maria </v>

84
00:06:05.781 --> 00:06:06.614
<v Speaker 1>evicting him from the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He needed to seize political power with </v>

85
00:06:09.261 --> 00:06:10.094
<v Speaker 1>an armed force and an economic monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This as the strategy he set in motion </v>

86
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.850
<v Speaker 1>and the steps he took to achieve his </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose,</v>

87
00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.903
<v Speaker 1>sort of listening,</v>

88
00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:25.170
<v Speaker 3>political power,</v>

89
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:28.913
<v Speaker 1>obviously his strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his first goal was to achieve political </v>

90
00:06:31.561 --> 00:06:34.860
<v Speaker 1>hegemony and social control by any means</v>
<v Speaker 1>necessary.</v>

91
00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:35.694
<v Speaker 1>This was very clear to Ortega from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning and he launched a double </v>

92
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:39.773
<v Speaker 1>tactic to achieve it fast by invading </v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutions and centralizing power </v>

93
00:06:45.571 --> 00:06:48.150
<v Speaker 1>and then my limiting and intimidating </v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposition,</v>

94
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:51.210
<v Speaker 1>something for which fear is usually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

95
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>very effective ingredients.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shortly after arriving Ortega launch day</v>

96
00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>paramilitary force composed of gang </v>
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>

97
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.093
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about shock and groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>better known in Nicaragua as the </v>

98
00:07:01.711 --> 00:07:02.544
<v Speaker 1>toddlers.</v>

99
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.510
<v Speaker 4>They are feared and the people call them</v>
<v Speaker 4>mobs.</v>

100
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.433
<v Speaker 4>They usually wear tee shirts that speak </v>
<v Speaker 4>of love and peace wear helmets to hide </v>

101
00:07:09.591 --> 00:07:10.424
<v Speaker 4>their faces and move on motorcycles.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're mostly very violent young </v>

102
00:07:14.751 --> 00:07:18.080
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] journalists in Managua.</v>

103
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.490
<v Speaker 1>It's objective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:07:19.491 --> 00:07:20.324
<v Speaker 1>I would be too intimidated to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political opposition to frighten those </v>

105
00:07:22.781 --> 00:07:23.614
<v Speaker 1>who disagree with the government and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>try and dismantle the opposition's </v>

106
00:07:26.441 --> 00:07:29.770
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations or concentrations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

107
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:30.663
<v Speaker 1>Obviously it isn't an official forests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they have the government's </v>

108
00:07:33.401 --> 00:07:37.130
<v Speaker 1>protection and we're going to see how </v>
<v Speaker 1>that works in just a moment.</v>

109
00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:38.893
<v Speaker 4>Say that a para military force has been </v>
<v Speaker 4>set up in Nicaragua that is composed of </v>

110
00:07:42.291 --> 00:07:45.540
<v Speaker 4>gang members,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but sometimes we get on a bus and a para</v>

111
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 4>military member is watching us </v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] Castillo,</v>

112
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.760
<v Speaker 4>Nicaraguan activist,</v>

113
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 1>but of course it doesn't end here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next step to achieve total political</v>

114
00:07:54.581 --> 00:07:58.480
<v Speaker 1>control is to take control of the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions as well.</v>

115
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.830
<v Speaker 1>How do you think he did that?</v>

116
00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:07.153
<v Speaker 3>Well</v>

117
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:10.440
<v Speaker 1>first political decentralization to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>ended,</v>

118
00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.363
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>municipal autonomy thus in Nicaragua or </v>

119
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 1>Tayga is political henchmen has managed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to dismiss mayors at will.</v>

120
00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

121
00:08:19.021 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 1>if you've got a political arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just kick him out of the race.</v>

122
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 1>That way you don't need to get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>your opponents.</v>

123
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 1>You also win loyal fans who of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to risk making him out.</v>

124
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.063
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second step to institutional </v>

125
00:08:34.601 --> 00:08:39.040
<v Speaker 1>takeover was do create ans or legitimize</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own political organizations.</v>

126
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.190
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the citizen power councils,</v>

127
00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:46.300
<v Speaker 1>these bodies which supposedly involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>community participation in practice have</v>

128
00:08:46.301 --> 00:08:47.134
<v Speaker 1>the objective of creating a parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>political structure that is recognized </v>

129
00:08:50.771 --> 00:08:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and controlled by the government.</v>

130
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:55.803
<v Speaker 3>I'm the feds</v>

131
00:08:55.910 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 1>appoints</v>

132
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v Speaker 3>and achieve the indefinite permanence of</v>
<v Speaker 3>his party associates in every key state </v>

133
00:09:01.651 --> 00:09:03.360
<v Speaker 3>position.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The electoral power,</v>

134
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:04.253
<v Speaker 3>the judicial power ends,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the general control that and different </v>

135
00:09:07.140 --> 00:09:07.973
<v Speaker 3>official protests.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that's what those moms is a four </v>

136
00:09:09.960 --> 00:09:10.793
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>So how about two examples of proving </v>

137
00:09:12.661 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 3>what Ortega achieved with this strategy?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

138
00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.223
<v Speaker 3>check this out.</v>

139
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:22.893
<v Speaker 1>One ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Nicaraguan Constitution prohibited </v>

140
00:09:24.611 --> 00:09:26.650
<v Speaker 1>the consecutive reelection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

141
00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:29.680
<v Speaker 1>so I'll tell you go would've completed </v>
<v Speaker 1>his turn and 2001</v>

142
00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:30.533
<v Speaker 3>11</v>

143
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.803
<v Speaker 1>as Hernandez did in on drs or Tayga and </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to get to the Constitutional </v>

144
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:39.713
<v Speaker 1>Chamber of the Supreme Court,</v>
<v Speaker 1>composed mostly of Sandinista </v>

145
00:09:40.831 --> 00:09:44.520
<v Speaker 1>magistrates stupid declared article one </v>
<v Speaker 1>four seven as in applicable,</v>

146
00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.383
<v Speaker 1>which is the one that prevented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential consecutive reelection in </v>

147
00:09:48.721 --> 00:09:49.860
<v Speaker 1>exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

148
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:53.610
<v Speaker 1>Theme Magistrates positions were insured</v>
<v Speaker 1>for life.</v>

149
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:58.700
<v Speaker 1>Quite the exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

150
00:09:58.770 --> 00:09:59.603
<v Speaker 1>in 2011 fraud suspicions were so intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>that both the European Union and the </v>

151
00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:05.993
<v Speaker 1>Organization of American States </v>
<v Speaker 1>concluded that they weren't sure if the </v>

152
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:08.010
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

153
00:10:08.011 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 1>you controlled the electoral power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes it would be,</v>

154
00:10:11.311 --> 00:10:12.144
<v Speaker 1>or tag or,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he made sure that his followers </v>

155
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>could do and undo whatever they wanted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

156
00:10:16.861 --> 00:10:19.440
<v Speaker 1>in the following elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2016 ones,</v>

157
00:10:19.441 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even split and the ruling </v>
<v Speaker 1>party took full control of the process.</v>

158
00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:25.500
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be thinking,</v>

159
00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>I mean it wasn't there a big scandal </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the Simon.</v>

160
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that the president had made </v>

161
00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:34.030
<v Speaker 1>sure that practically every major media </v>
<v Speaker 1>station in the country,</v>

162
00:10:34.050 --> 00:10:36.780
<v Speaker 1>it was controlled by his family of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>associates.</v>

163
00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:38.640
<v Speaker 3>You're taking</v>

164
00:10:38.640 --> 00:10:39.473
<v Speaker 1>a family monopolizes the media in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua mobs and the occupation of </v>

165
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:45.750
<v Speaker 1>institutions and the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

166
00:10:45.751 --> 00:10:50.751
<v Speaker 1>this is the political side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this much more the force monopoly as</v>

167
00:10:59.311 --> 00:11:01.410
<v Speaker 1>cool as much as he holds political </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

168
00:11:01.440 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>If a dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't hold the military force,</v>

169
00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:07.530
<v Speaker 1>he's taking a huge risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was very clear to our protagonists.</v>

170
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 1>Say these seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pillar of this strategy was to take over</v>

171
00:11:10.141 --> 00:11:10.974
<v Speaker 1>the police and to take over the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did he say he took advantage of his </v>

172
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:17.514
<v Speaker 1>majority in the National Assembly as </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon as he got into power or take your </v>

173
00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:21.103
<v Speaker 1>push to reform that place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to appoint new faculties of </v>

174
00:11:23.641 --> 00:11:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the National Police and the army of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic in his hands.</v>

175
00:11:28.830 --> 00:11:30.960
<v Speaker 1>Then taking advantage of these new </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

176
00:11:30.961 --> 00:11:31.794
<v Speaker 1>He placed relatives and loyal people </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] in charge of these </v>

177
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:36.210
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

178
00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:40.110
<v Speaker 1>the police aren't directed by his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>father in law Francisco Diaz.</v>

179
00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>This means you can get the police to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look the other way.</v>

180
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:42.881
<v Speaker 1>When the mob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zach,</v>

181
00:11:42.881 --> 00:11:45.240
<v Speaker 1>since when the opposition strikes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

182
00:11:45.450 --> 00:11:46.283
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well more repression because when the </v>

183
00:11:52.441 --> 00:11:55.660
<v Speaker 1>mafia holds the power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not easy for them to let go.</v>

184
00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've covered politics and we've covered</v>

185
00:11:57.371 --> 00:11:58.204
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a third element </v>

186
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:00.454
<v Speaker 1>missing</v>

187
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.950
<v Speaker 1>economic power.</v>

188
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:09.120
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

189
00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.990
<v Speaker 1>Pillar in the strategy was to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic power for three reasons.</v>

190
00:12:13.020 --> 00:12:13.853
<v Speaker 1>First to prevent in Nicaragua and </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital from supporting an alternative </v>

191
00:12:17.220 --> 00:12:21.090
<v Speaker 1>seconds to get resources with which to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry out Ortega's plans and third,</v>

192
00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:23.700
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most important points to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fill his pockets,</v>

193
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:31.220
<v Speaker 1>less time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It corruption has been brutal to such an</v>

194
00:12:31.221 --> 00:12:34.610
<v Speaker 1>extent that the Ortega Morello family a </v>
<v Speaker 1>million as see,</v>

195
00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:38.000
<v Speaker 1>they've taken over the media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they hold high positions in the states.</v>

196
00:12:38.001 --> 00:12:42.410
<v Speaker 1>They've even taken over oil important </v>
<v Speaker 1>distributions in Nicaragua.</v>

197
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:44.660
<v Speaker 1>They put themselves in charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

198
00:12:44.661 --> 00:12:48.440
<v Speaker 1>promotion agencies with a plan that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could describe like this,</v>

199
00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:50.720
<v Speaker 1>wanting to invest in Nicaragua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

200
00:12:50.750 --> 00:12:53.030
<v Speaker 1>We'll make it happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you have to give me,</v>

201
00:12:53.031 --> 00:12:54.980
<v Speaker 1>I can mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know for the country,</v>

202
00:12:55.010 --> 00:12:55.843
<v Speaker 1>they've also reached agreements with </v>
<v Speaker 1>businessmen apparently by getting </v>

203
00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:02.330
<v Speaker 1>loyalty and envelopes in exchange for </v>
<v Speaker 1>privileges.</v>

204
00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:06.313
<v Speaker 1>Your example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this way of doing things was the </v>

205
00:13:07.701 --> 00:13:08.534
<v Speaker 1>agreements made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>She builds the interracial Yannick </v>

206
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.220
<v Speaker 1>canal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly unsuccessful projects in which</v>

207
00:13:13.221 --> 00:13:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the government reached an under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table agreement with [inaudible],</v>

208
00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.353
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese developer working on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thea state kept half of the </v>

209
00:13:20.391 --> 00:13:23.990
<v Speaker 1>profits since then with a last minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>change it became 1%</v>

210
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:24.923
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

211
00:13:26.310 --> 00:13:27.143
<v Speaker 1>we as Lenny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the businessmen did some last minute </v>

212
00:13:28.801 --> 00:13:33.090
<v Speaker 1>haggling in short their viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The factors that with political power,</v>

213
00:13:33.130 --> 00:13:35.520
<v Speaker 1>with brute force and with economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

214
00:13:35.521 --> 00:13:36.354
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Ortega became the owner and Lord </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Nicaragua and also a billionaire and </v>

215
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:45.780
<v Speaker 1>just in case in the last election in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 he presented Rosario Marillo.</v>

216
00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.673
<v Speaker 1>His wife has vice presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so everything certainly stays in the </v>

217
00:13:49.861 --> 00:13:50.160
<v Speaker 1>family</v>

218
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:50.993
<v Speaker 3>late.</v>

219
00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.890
<v Speaker 1>This is essentially the same thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in Venezuela.</v>

220
00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:00.920
<v Speaker 1>It is so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manual for a dictator.</v>

221
00:14:00.980 --> 00:14:01.813
<v Speaker 1>And the question we can ask ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>now is can we really pretends that </v>

222
00:14:04.941 --> 00:14:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua or is still a democracy?</v>
