1
00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.503
<v Speaker 1>The conflicts between Israel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Palestine is one of them is complicated </v>

2
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:12.830
<v Speaker 1>in international politics and as you all</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably know,</v>

3
00:00:12.831 --> 00:00:13.664
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>political situations in the entire </v>

4
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:16.694
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to make it easier in this </v>

5
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:18.884
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to tackle the very delicate </v>

6
00:00:20.151 --> 00:00:22.580
<v Speaker 1>issue of the Israeli settlements in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>West Bank,</v>

7
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:23.443
<v Speaker 1>and this is a pretty major issue because</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all countries find these </v>

8
00:00:25.851 --> 00:00:30.290
<v Speaker 1>settlements to be a serious violation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>international law in the last 40 years.</v>

9
00:00:30.291 --> 00:00:31.124
<v Speaker 1>All of the administrations in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States have taken a position against </v>

10
00:00:33.681 --> 00:00:34.910
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when I say them,</v>

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.833
<v Speaker 1>I do mean all of them and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this matter has compromised the special </v>

12
00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>relationship that exists between the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Israel.</v>

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.970
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not talking about governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jimmy Carter's yet,</v>

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

15
00:00:44.991 --> 00:00:45.824
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan himself demanded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate freeze of any new settlements </v>

16
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.050
<v Speaker 1>as he claims they were an evident </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles piece.</v>

17
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.913
<v Speaker 1>George Hw Bush threatens to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>disciplinary measures of an economic </v>

18
00:00:54.591 --> 00:00:55.424
<v Speaker 1>nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Bill Clinton proposed a law to </v>

19
00:00:57.081 --> 00:00:59.750
<v Speaker 1>punish Israel by reducing American </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistance.</v>

20
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.613
<v Speaker 1>Even today at trump's administration has</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked Israel to stop being such a pain </v>

21
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:06.620
<v Speaker 1>in the ass about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since taking office in January,</v>

22
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.310
<v Speaker 1>trump has publicly asked Netanyahu to </v>
<v Speaker 1>constrain suddenly construction,</v>

23
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.160
<v Speaker 1>but has not condemned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The State Department has said that it is</v>

24
00:01:13.161 --> 00:01:13.994
<v Speaker 1>not helpful to the peace process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think Israel has done in </v>

25
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:18.530
<v Speaker 1>the face of all this criticism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:18.531 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>they have basically ignored it and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>kept expanding their settlements,</v>

27
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we are here.</v>

28
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.643
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering what are these </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements and what do they really </v>

29
00:01:27.201 --> 00:01:28.011
<v Speaker 1>mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:28.011 --> 00:01:33.011
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Settlers and settlement.</v>

31
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Last thing we need to know is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to agreements that have been </v>

32
00:01:39.671 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>reached,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory,</v>

33
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.980
<v Speaker 1>your state of Palestine is formed by </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is today known as the West Bank and</v>

34
00:01:44.981 --> 00:01:45.814
<v Speaker 1>the Gaza Strip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These territories corresponds to the </v>

35
00:01:47.591 --> 00:01:48.424
<v Speaker 1>political map prior to the six day war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after which Israel occupied these </v>

36
00:01:51.581 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 1>territories which used to belong to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jordan.</v>

37
00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>So the settlements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are essentially communities,</v>

38
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.333
<v Speaker 1>villages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towns and cities that Israel has been </v>

39
00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>building since 1970.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the West Bank territory.</v>

40
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:02.744
<v Speaker 1>You have the future Palestinian state </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is not just a few houses we're </v>

41
00:02:05.561 --> 00:02:06.394
<v Speaker 1>talking about here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The West Bank is a small territory at </v>

42
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:10.300
<v Speaker 1>belly 5,600</v>
<v Speaker 1>square kilometers,</v>

43
00:02:10.301 --> 00:02:12.070
<v Speaker 1>which is about the size of the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Delaware,</v>

44
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.950
<v Speaker 1>but even so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is not considering east theresa</v>

45
00:02:14.951 --> 00:02:15.784
<v Speaker 1>limp plant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 131 settlements and furthermore there </v>

46
00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:21.790
<v Speaker 1>are an additional 97 out posts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are posts,</v>

47
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.130
<v Speaker 1>they are settlements as well if it in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these cases,</v>

48
00:02:24.131 --> 00:02:27.040
<v Speaker 1>these settlements are illegal even under</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israeli law.</v>

49
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Speaker 1>These are posts they were built without </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consent of the Israeli government.</v>

50
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.273
<v Speaker 1>That means that there are more than 228 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israeli settlements around the West </v>

51
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.913
<v Speaker 1>Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many are in places of relevant value </v>

52
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.074
<v Speaker 1>like aquifers and that makes it more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated because roads and </v>

53
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:43.330
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure need to be set up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to connect to them.</v>

54
00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:44.193
<v Speaker 1>Besides Israel needs to protect these </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements and that involves police </v>

55
00:02:46.871 --> 00:02:47.704
<v Speaker 1>patrolling around the West Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which affects the mobility of </v>

56
00:02:49.631 --> 00:02:52.840
<v Speaker 1>Palestinians and makes economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>development even more difficult,</v>

57
00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.640
<v Speaker 2>and the</v>

58
00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 1>problem isn't just the existence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these is that they don't stop growing in</v>

59
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.194
<v Speaker 1>the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 2000 new buildings have </v>

60
00:03:03.821 --> 00:03:06.990
<v Speaker 1>started to be constructed and there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans to build $3,000</v>

61
00:03:06.991 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>more in the next year alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously in addition to this,</v>

62
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 1>there are also medical centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools,</v>

63
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.880
<v Speaker 1>synagogues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

64
00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.743
<v Speaker 1>So once the result of all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well take a look at this chart to see </v>

65
00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>how the population has evolved.</v>

66
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.350
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:26.243
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who are pro settlements claim </v>

68
00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:31.110
<v Speaker 1>these population centers are growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>where they used to be nothing.</v>

69
00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.973
<v Speaker 1>Consider what the mayor of marley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I remember sounds about one of the main </v>

70
00:03:34.351 --> 00:03:37.080
<v Speaker 1>settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't steal the land from anybody.</v>

71
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.973
<v Speaker 1>It was built on empty hills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see there the desert rocks and </v>

72
00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 1>sand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you have a living city.</v>

73
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.360
<v Speaker 1>Then in cash rail mayor of ma'ale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adumim,</v>

74
00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:47.490
<v Speaker 1>ma'ale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adam is a city of 40,000</v>

75
00:03:47.491 --> 00:03:49.380
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants with schools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kindergartens,</v>

76
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:50.360
<v Speaker 1>a theater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a library,</v>

77
00:03:50.361 --> 00:03:54.000
<v Speaker 1>and industrial center according to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>residents that it's a complete city.</v>

78
00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.750
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

79
00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.583
<v Speaker 1>so what exactly is the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that in order to solve </v>

80
00:03:57.781 --> 00:03:58.614
<v Speaker 1>the Israel palestine conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all parties agree the two states and </v>

81
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:04.680
<v Speaker 1>necessary one being Israel and to being </v>
<v Speaker 1>palestine,</v>

82
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.740
<v Speaker 1>but with all the sediments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>palestinian sovereignty in the west bank</v>

83
00:04:07.741 --> 00:04:11.460
<v Speaker 1>will be in serious danger because Israel</v>
<v Speaker 1>has already said they will never give up</v>

84
00:04:11.461 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty over these places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that includes the roads,</v>

85
00:04:14.401 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the security controls.</v>

86
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:17.183
<v Speaker 1>Let's be clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>palestine will be unable to become an </v>

87
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:22.080
<v Speaker 1>effective and autonomous state with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations,</v>

88
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:23.910
<v Speaker 1>especially considering these </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements.</v>

89
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:24.744
<v Speaker 1>Waves stopped growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Settlements are illegal under </v>

90
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:27.960
<v Speaker 1>international law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At present,</v>

91
00:04:27.961 --> 00:04:28.794
<v Speaker 1>one of the main impediments to peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicola and letting of united nations </v>

92
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:32.814
<v Speaker 1>envoy on middle east peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you can probably understand why </v>

93
00:04:35.071 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>this topic makes everyone so 10 years</v>

94
00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.140
<v Speaker 1>more and more</v>

95
00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.223
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

96
00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Ins and yahoo's settlement policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't stopped growing since 2015.</v>

97
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.520
<v Speaker 1>The situation has reached a point and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's on the 23rd of December,</v>

98
00:04:51.521 --> 00:04:52.354
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The un security council passed a </v>

99
00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.690
<v Speaker 1>resolution 2134 that strongly condemns </v>
<v Speaker 1>the israeli settlement policy.</v>

100
00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.213
<v Speaker 1>Security council reaffirms that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment by Israel of settlements </v>

101
00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:06.430
<v Speaker 1>in the palestinian territory occupied </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1967,</v>

102
00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.323
<v Speaker 1>including east jerusalem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has no legal validity and constitutes a </v>

103
00:05:09.761 --> 00:05:10.594
<v Speaker 1>flagrant violation under international </v>
<v Speaker 1>law and a major obstacle to the </v>

104
00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:14.164
<v Speaker 1>achievement of a two state solution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just lasting and comprehensive peace </v>

105
00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>resolution to three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three slash four of the security council</v>

106
00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:21.543
<v Speaker 1>resolution could be passed because for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time the us didn't use their </v>

107
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:24.964
<v Speaker 1>rights to veto the resolution as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that made netanyahu's </v>

108
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:28.283
<v Speaker 1>governments really furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The prime miniSter didn't hesitate in </v>

109
00:05:30.641 --> 00:05:31.474
<v Speaker 1>describing the situation is absurd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even accused barack obama's </v>

110
00:05:33.881 --> 00:05:34.714
<v Speaker 1>administration in public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've tried to carry out a shameful anti </v>

111
00:05:37.251 --> 00:05:39.130
<v Speaker 1>israeli maneuver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

112
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>he was pretty angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this resolution shouldn't have taken</v>

113
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.623
<v Speaker 1>you by surprise given some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions he announced in 2016 and </v>

114
00:05:46.601 --> 00:05:48.580
<v Speaker 1>confirmed in 2017</v>

115
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 1>ready governments has started a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlements in the west bank,</v>

116
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:55.584
<v Speaker 1>which is the first for two decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Israel not only has decided to </v>

117
00:05:58.371 --> 00:05:59.204
<v Speaker 1>encourage the existing settlements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they've even started a new one on </v>

118
00:06:02.271 --> 00:06:03.104
<v Speaker 1>the other hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a powered by the alleged good </v>

119
00:06:04.881 --> 00:06:05.714
<v Speaker 1>relations with trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The parliaments in Israel after lots of </v>

120
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:08.774
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It finally passed a new law in the </v>

121
00:06:10.101 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 1>beginning of 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This lot legalized is around 4,000</v>

122
00:06:13.761 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>houses built on palestinian private </v>
<v Speaker 1>property houses that the israeli supreme</v>

123
00:06:18.351 --> 00:06:19.184
<v Speaker 1>court had even ordered to be dismantled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rules of the game have changed with </v>

124
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:23.774
<v Speaker 1>donald trump's arrival as president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We no longer have our hands tied as we </v>

125
00:06:25.851 --> 00:06:26.684
<v Speaker 1>did in the time of barack obama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we could finally build and take </v>

126
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:29.840
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said before,</v>

127
00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:30.674
<v Speaker 1>the fact that trump might look closer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel doesn't mean that his </v>

128
00:06:32.811 --> 00:06:35.960
<v Speaker 1>administration isn't also tired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of this settlement issue,</v>

129
00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.853
<v Speaker 1>that is why I'm in order to regain </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's favorite jerusalem is committed </v>

130
00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:40.153
<v Speaker 1>to starting a new policy that seems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>slow down the growth of existing </v>

131
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 1>settlements and forbid outposts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's completely,</v>

132
00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:46.633
<v Speaker 1>but the new policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so cryptic and complicated that it </v>

133
00:06:48.561 --> 00:06:50.320
<v Speaker 1>seems very likely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These settlements,</v>

134
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.183
<v Speaker 1>they'll just keep growing and now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably have another question which is </v>

135
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:55.340
<v Speaker 1>why do these settlements are they grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>so much?</v>

136
00:06:55.370 --> 00:06:57.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay close attention here,</v>

137
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:01.803
<v Speaker 1>inexplicably policy thinking about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do so many israelis want to live in </v>

138
00:07:07.181 --> 00:07:08.014
<v Speaker 1>these conflict zones?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it because maybe there are some </v>

139
00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:12.280
<v Speaker 1>valuable natural resources to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploited as well?</v>

140
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:15.700
<v Speaker 1>NoT really the explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much less creative.</v>

141
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:19.630
<v Speaker 1>The government of Israel is subsidizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>the establishment of these settlements.</v>

142
00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:21.640
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government in Israel,</v>

143
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:23.710
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] finances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction of houses,</v>

144
00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:28.150
<v Speaker 1>creating discounts of almost 70 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the price of land and offers a great</v>

145
00:07:28.151 --> 00:07:31.030
<v Speaker 1>deal of financial aid and you know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results as well.</v>

146
00:07:31.031 --> 00:07:35.310
<v Speaker 1>Houses are 40 percent cheaper than in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the formal territory of Israel and say,</v>

147
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:36.183
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not all the governments of </v>

148
00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:37.594
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also interested is to get our take and </v>

149
00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:42.100
<v Speaker 1>provides all kinds of public services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as you can imagine,</v>

150
00:07:42.101 --> 00:07:42.934
<v Speaker 1>the youth ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many families see these as places where </v>

151
00:07:45.011 --> 00:07:48.550
<v Speaker 1>they can have a better life than they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could in israel's formal territory.</v>

152
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:49.990
<v Speaker 1>So now the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

153
00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.180
<v Speaker 1>how does Israel itself benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

154
00:07:52.210 --> 00:07:54.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is they really don't.</v>

155
00:07:54.141 --> 00:07:54.974
<v Speaker 1>So an exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they get just a bunch of political and </v>

156
00:07:56.741 --> 00:07:57.574
<v Speaker 1>economic problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These settlements aren't just an </v>

157
00:07:59.141 --> 00:07:59.974
<v Speaker 1>obstacle for the peace process and </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy because they are also a </v>

158
00:08:02.411 --> 00:08:05.050
<v Speaker 1>big waste of public money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look with the subsidies,</v>

159
00:08:05.051 --> 00:08:05.884
<v Speaker 1>the security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the expensive public services for these </v>

160
00:08:07.391 --> 00:08:10.180
<v Speaker 1>now foundation and the advert center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both israeli by the way,</v>

161
00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:13.510
<v Speaker 1>estimate that the cost of these is more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a billion dollars a year.</v>

162
00:08:13.540 --> 00:08:14.373
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing that's an expensive </v>

163
00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:20.320
<v Speaker 1>policy both for the citizens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>palestine as well as those of Israel.</v>

164
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.560
<v Speaker 1>To get fooled,</v>

165
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:30.993
<v Speaker 1>let me be absolutely clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel is a country full of positive </v>

166
00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>things like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neighboring countries.</v>

167
00:08:35.491 --> 00:08:36.324
<v Speaker 1>Israel is a consolidated democracy with </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong civil liberties and a prosperous </v>

168
00:08:40.021 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>and innovative economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the products and services we use</v>

169
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:43.824
<v Speaker 1>everyday wouldn't exist if it weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the technology developed in Israel </v>

170
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:47.123
<v Speaker 1>and don't be false.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putting an end to these settlements </v>

171
00:08:48.541 --> 00:08:52.830
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't mean and ends of the conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is a precedence in 2005.</v>

172
00:08:52.831 --> 00:08:53.664
<v Speaker 1>Israel left the gaza strip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely stopping all the settlements </v>

173
00:08:56.101 --> 00:08:56.934
<v Speaker 1>and removing all civilians and soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the result was neither piece nor </v>

174
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:01.074
<v Speaker 1>prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The strip is now Controlled by hamas </v>

175
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:03.474
<v Speaker 1>radicals and it is even in conflict with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government to palestine itself and </v>

176
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.270
<v Speaker 1>the situation isn't good from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian perspective,</v>

177
00:09:09.271 --> 00:09:10.104
<v Speaker 1>but it definitely doesn't justify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement policy of Israel and their </v>

178
00:09:12.991 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>lack of commitment towards the peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements.</v>

179
00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:18.600
<v Speaker 1>And so now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there really any possible solution to</v>

180
00:09:18.601 --> 00:09:19.340
<v Speaker 1>this conflict?</v>

181
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more experts claim the solution</v>

182
00:09:21.301 --> 00:09:22.134
<v Speaker 1>needs to be a bottom up strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say encourage economic </v>

183
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.184
<v Speaker 1>development in the west bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Establish a dialogue and understanding </v>

184
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:29.334
<v Speaker 1>where trade relations between israelis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and palestinians and normal answer lets </v>

185
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.730
<v Speaker 1>the national authorities in palestine </v>
<v Speaker 1>have more jurisdiction.</v>

186
00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:37.500
<v Speaker 1>These,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will require time,</v>

187
00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 1>but more than that they require </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitments.</v>

188
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:40.621
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

189
00:09:40.621 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think should happen with the</v>

190
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:43.351
<v Speaker 1>settlements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
