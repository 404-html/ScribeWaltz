1
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:08.873
<v Speaker 1>Which about a launch list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>small countries which are more </v>

2
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:12.330
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions may seem silly,</v>

3
00:00:12.331 --> 00:00:14.490
<v Speaker 1>but if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I guarantee you they are not</v>

4
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.360
<v Speaker 1>well that is gaining more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

5
00:00:21.361 --> 00:00:23.670
<v Speaker 1>so obviously countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are becoming smaller.</v>

6
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.700
<v Speaker 1>Since 1950.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our wealth has gone from having about 60</v>

7
00:00:26.701 --> 00:00:30.650
<v Speaker 1>countries to having more than 200.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this may lead to a few questions.</v>

8
00:00:30.651 --> 00:00:32.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll smaller countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good or a bad thing.</v>

9
00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.100
<v Speaker 1>Are they more viable in some way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While these are the questions that we're</v>

10
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:35.934
<v Speaker 1>going to answer in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first a quick comment when we're </v>

11
00:00:38.491 --> 00:00:39.324
<v Speaker 1>talking about small countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we need countries where the </v>

12
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:43.290
<v Speaker 1>population of fewer than 10 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants,</v>

13
00:00:43.291 --> 00:00:44.124
<v Speaker 1>this includes Hong Kong and Macau </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even though they are a part of </v>

14
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:48.570
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have their own laws,</v>

15
00:00:48.571 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 1>they have their own courts and customs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

16
00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:51.393
<v Speaker 1>This is a law that grants its citizens' </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights and freedoms that would be </v>

17
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.780
<v Speaker 1>unimaginable in any other place in China</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of Macau,</v>

18
00:00:57.781 --> 00:01:00.120
<v Speaker 1>which was integrated into China </v>
<v Speaker 1>following the same model.</v>

19
00:01:00.121 --> 00:01:02.430
<v Speaker 1>So having several of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's proceed to the key issue.</v>

20
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:05.100
<v Speaker 1>What is happening with these small </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

21
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.460
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually a really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue in international politics,</v>

22
00:01:08.461 --> 00:01:09.294
<v Speaker 1>we all knew that a good deal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political conflicts have to do with </v>

23
00:01:11.341 --> 00:01:12.174
<v Speaker 1>precisely this with many territories </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to declare themselves </v>

24
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:15.623
<v Speaker 1>independent hands become new countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some examples are Scotland's Catalonia </v>

25
00:01:19.381 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>and go to start</v>

26
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.280
<v Speaker 1>in the small.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt here.</v>

27
00:01:30.281 --> 00:01:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Smaller countries don't usually play a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large role in international news.</v>

28
00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:35.770
<v Speaker 1>They aren't really involved in major </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts.</v>

29
00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:36.604
<v Speaker 1>They don't participate in major decision</v>
<v Speaker 1>making processes and truthfully that </v>

30
00:01:40.021 --> 00:01:42.610
<v Speaker 1>political news is not usually that well </v>
<v Speaker 1>known,</v>

31
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.700
<v Speaker 1>but this is all pretty normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all know the presidents of the United</v>

32
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.533
<v Speaker 1>States or France or Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who cares about the rules of countries </v>

33
00:01:48.491 --> 00:01:50.260
<v Speaker 1>like Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark or Taiwan.</v>

34
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's true on visual politic.</v>

35
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:52.834
<v Speaker 1>We tend to talk about them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not really that common out </v>

36
00:01:55.391 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 1>there in the room.</v>

37
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.773
<v Speaker 2>Real wealth,</v>

38
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.320
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that in the last 30 years,</v>

39
00:02:03.321 --> 00:02:05.690
<v Speaker 1>if something has characterized smaller </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

40
00:02:05.691 --> 00:02:09.020
<v Speaker 1>is that they do things a lot better than</v>
<v Speaker 1>large countries.</v>

41
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.913
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever ranking is published about the </v>

42
00:02:11.121 --> 00:02:12.950
<v Speaker 1>richest countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most innovative,</v>

43
00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>most competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiest,</v>

44
00:02:14.271 --> 00:02:15.700
<v Speaker 1>safest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things,</v>

45
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.550
<v Speaker 1>small countries almost always occupied </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the top positions.</v>

46
00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.241
<v Speaker 1>Hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

47
00:02:20.241 --> 00:02:21.074
<v Speaker 1>It's usually when we read these rankings</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we kind of noticed there exist and </v>

48
00:02:23.421 --> 00:02:24.800
<v Speaker 1>we probably ask ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

49
00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.230
<v Speaker 1>I want to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do it.</v>

50
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we take for example,</v>

51
00:02:33.961 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>the ranking of the richest countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

52
00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.600
<v Speaker 1>that is the countries with the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>GDP per capita.</v>

53
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:42.930
<v Speaker 1>We find this among the 10 richest </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

54
00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 1>Nine of them are smaller countries by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

55
00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.013
<v Speaker 1>out of those nine countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight half less than 6 million </v>

56
00:02:51.331 --> 00:02:52.440
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

57
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>they are much smaller than some cities </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Dallas,</v>

58
00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Philadelphia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Toronto.</v>

59
00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.400
<v Speaker 1>She's the top 25 countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things they change a bit,</v>

60
00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.263
<v Speaker 1>but not that much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of the top 25 richest countries in </v>

61
00:03:07.491 --> 00:03:08.930
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>17,</v>

62
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 1>all small</v>

63
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:10.473
<v Speaker 2>countries</v>

64
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.563
<v Speaker 1>take price differences into account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is if we take the GDP per capita </v>

65
00:03:17.481 --> 00:03:19.230
<v Speaker 1>pad with purchasing power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact,</v>

66
00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.310
<v Speaker 1>so even more shockingly one sided in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that case,</v>

67
00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.340
<v Speaker 1>14 of the richest territories in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>welds are all talking about really,</v>

68
00:03:30.961 --> 00:03:31.794
<v Speaker 1>really different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have a high population density </v>

69
00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.070
<v Speaker 1>like Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>others have a really low,</v>

70
00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:41.904
<v Speaker 1>unlike Finland's some also have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources like Qatar and others </v>

71
00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.073
<v Speaker 1>have practically nothing like ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Art more agricultural and others are </v>

72
00:03:51.651 --> 00:03:52.484
<v Speaker 1>more financial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some are large and territory and others </v>

73
00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:55.483
<v Speaker 1>are not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say there is an absolutely </v>

74
00:03:57.501 --> 00:03:58.334
<v Speaker 1>huge variety,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all have one thing in common </v>

75
00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.910
<v Speaker 1>and that's very few in</v>

76
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.490
<v Speaker 2>who told you</v>

77
00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.180
<v Speaker 1>about countries like Iceland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>

78
00:04:09.181 --> 00:04:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>

79
00:04:10.051 --> 00:04:11.100
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>

80
00:04:11.101 --> 00:04:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Austria,</v>

81
00:04:12.061 --> 00:04:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland and Finland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here and in 2014 and 2015.</v>

82
00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:17.124
<v Speaker 1>Two studies published by the Credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>Suisse research units corroborated this </v>

83
00:04:19.981 --> 00:04:20.814
<v Speaker 1>exact situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He studies found that small countries </v>

84
00:04:23.911 --> 00:04:27.570
<v Speaker 1>tend to be richer and more egalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more socially advanced.</v>

85
00:04:27.571 --> 00:04:28.590
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on average,</v>

86
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.260
<v Speaker 1>they invest a lot more in things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>their education</v>

87
00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:32.363
<v Speaker 2>health.</v>

88
00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.880
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Small countries tend to have more lawful</v>

89
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:37.230
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have less debt,</v>

90
00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>less deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even fewer taxes.</v>

91
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Even if we look at their financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets or stock exchanges.</v>

92
00:04:42.781 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will see it in the last decades.</v>

93
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Smaller countries markets have performed</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>

94
00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:49.103
<v Speaker 1>Have a look at this chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I'm probably going to voice the </v>

95
00:04:57.681 --> 00:05:00.740
<v Speaker 1>question that all of you are thinking in</v>
<v Speaker 1>your mind is right now on that swell.</v>

96
00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.800
<v Speaker 1>How on earth is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well to success,</v>

97
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:13.770
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

98
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.603
<v Speaker 1>Do small countries work better than </v>
<v Speaker 1>large ones on big countries spaced out </v>

99
00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 1>larger markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more business opportunities,</v>

100
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 1>and a greater ability to take advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of economies of scale.</v>

101
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 1>So what's failing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just before we get into it,</v>

102
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:26.484
<v Speaker 1>I do want to say that I am excluding tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>havens here because that's not really </v>

103
00:05:29.581 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nivo.</v>

104
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Finland's Austria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>

105
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:32.694
<v Speaker 1>or New Zealand for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be considered under any </v>

106
00:05:34.621 --> 00:05:36.210
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tax Haven.</v>

107
00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>What is the explanation here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>as we usually say visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's never a single cause,</v>

109
00:05:45.821 --> 00:05:46.654
<v Speaker 1>but we can see that these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity comes largely from that own </v>

110
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:51.003
<v Speaker 1>weakness.</v>

111
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.680
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

112
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.350
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these small countries are involved in</v>

113
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.590
<v Speaker 1>more international trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only sell,</v>

114
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>but also to buy the products they need a</v>
<v Speaker 1>small country,</v>

115
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:02.510
<v Speaker 1>obviously they can't produce everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>they need.</v>

116
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are more exposed to competition and</v>

117
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:07.040
<v Speaker 1>the swings of the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial market,</v>

118
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.903
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

119
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:10.423
<v Speaker 1>forces them to be more prudent with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their accounts to keep themselves </v>

120
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:13.450
<v Speaker 1>competitive kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

121
00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.313
<v Speaker 1>since they can't afford them to avoid </v>
<v Speaker 1>the implementation of protectionist </v>

122
00:06:17.741 --> 00:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

123
00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:19.643
<v Speaker 1>want to take a look at another data </v>
<v Speaker 1>point seat 21 out of 25 of the most </v>

124
00:06:23.051 --> 00:06:23.884
<v Speaker 1>globalized countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is countries that are most open to </v>

125
00:06:26.201 --> 00:06:29.410
<v Speaker 1>the movements of goods people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital our small country,</v>

126
00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.313
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

127
00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Own Hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to see how these countries </v>

128
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:38.460
<v Speaker 1>economy and his company competitiveness </v>
<v Speaker 1>work,</v>

129
00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:41.220
<v Speaker 1>we only need to take a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

130
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:44.040
<v Speaker 1>the weld banks doing business index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which as you know,</v>

131
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:46.890
<v Speaker 1>classifies countries based on that ease </v>
<v Speaker 1>of doing business.</v>

132
00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.073
<v Speaker 1>The latest doing business 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the World Bank published on </v>

133
00:06:52.361 --> 00:06:56.350
<v Speaker 1>October the 31st 2017 is also dominated </v>
<v Speaker 1>by small countries.</v>

134
00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:57.460
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>

135
00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hong Kong.</v>

136
00:06:58.910 --> 00:06:59.743
<v Speaker 1>Occupied four of the top five places and</v>
<v Speaker 1>among the top 25 countries in the world </v>

137
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:04.474
<v Speaker 1>for doing business 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small countries and there's something </v>

138
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:15.290
<v Speaker 1>even more important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

139
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.163
<v Speaker 1>small countries tend to have much less </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy first because they don't </v>

140
00:07:19.171 --> 00:07:20.004
<v Speaker 1>need so many political structures or at </v>
<v Speaker 1>least it's hard to justify them seconds </v>

141
00:07:23.401 --> 00:07:27.630
<v Speaker 1>because citizens tend to be more aware </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the costs involved and third,</v>

142
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.553
<v Speaker 1>because they simply can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The role of this is that small </v>

143
00:07:34.431 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to be more flexible,</v>

144
00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.390
<v Speaker 1>more competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and less bureaucratic.</v>

145
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.250
<v Speaker 1>Before some of you might be thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

146
00:07:40.251 --> 00:07:41.084
<v Speaker 1>well Simon couldn't small countries beat</v>
<v Speaker 1>Richard because they were created </v>

147
00:07:43.611 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 1>enriched zones and Richard territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 1>the honest truth of that is simply no</v>

149
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:49.083
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

150
00:07:51.730 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>Of Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's the case of Singapore,</v>

151
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:54.284
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which just a few decades ago were quite </v>

152
00:07:56.301 --> 00:08:00.230
<v Speaker 1>poor countries and so on nowadays to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the richest countries in the world.</v>

153
00:08:00.270 --> 00:08:02.160
<v Speaker 1>Another good example is the old republic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

154
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.130
<v Speaker 2>a vacuum.</v>

155
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:12.740
<v Speaker 1>Proof of separation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1993,</v>

156
00:08:12.741 --> 00:08:15.350
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia decided to divide into </v>
<v Speaker 1>two smaller countries,</v>

157
00:08:15.351 --> 00:08:16.580
<v Speaker 1>the Czech Republic and</v>

158
00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:17.633
<v Speaker 2>the vacuum</v>

159
00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.650
<v Speaker 1>that time both countries which used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>form Czechoslovakia,</v>

160
00:08:21.790 --> 00:08:22.623
<v Speaker 1>suffered the effects of the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union's Fullan's underwent a severe </v>

161
00:08:25.421 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

162
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:27.304
<v Speaker 1>despite this the check side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still much richer than the slave </v>

163
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:30.724
<v Speaker 1>act.</v>

164
00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.823
<v Speaker 2>In fact</v>

165
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:33.190
<v Speaker 1>is the Vacchio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The park,</v>

166
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.053
<v Speaker 1>as their income was only 65 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment rates were almost five </v>

167
00:08:37.281 --> 00:08:39.110
<v Speaker 1>times higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Slovak Republic,</v>

168
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.953
<v Speaker 1>it depended too much on the money that </v>
<v Speaker 1>came as interregional solidarity from </v>

169
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:44.090
<v Speaker 1>the richest parts of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the</v>

170
00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 2>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well</v>

171
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.980
<v Speaker 1>since they separated in 1993,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both countries have done quite well.</v>

172
00:08:49.981 --> 00:08:50.814
<v Speaker 1>They successfully transitioned from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist model to a capitalist model </v>

173
00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:56.550
<v Speaker 1>and have both grown considerably more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than,</v>

174
00:08:56.551 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany.</v>

175
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>Now out of these two countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that has progressed the most has</v>

176
00:09:01.171 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 1>been Slovakia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

177
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>having to organize itself while having </v>
<v Speaker 1>to compete actually favored the poorest.</v>

178
00:09:05.820 --> 00:09:06.653
<v Speaker 1>You can see the clear convergence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>has occurred between both countries and </v>

179
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:09.594
<v Speaker 1>the following crop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll explain everything about this in </v>

180
00:09:15.201 --> 00:09:17.300
<v Speaker 1>an upcoming video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're done.</v>

181
00:09:17.330 --> 00:09:19.700
<v Speaker 1>We just want to have one last note here.</v>

182
00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:26.610
<v Speaker 2>The new world configuration.</v>

183
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:28.893
<v Speaker 1>Globalization has led to countries with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a large population no longer having the </v>

184
00:09:31.481 --> 00:09:34.630
<v Speaker 1>upper hand and it's not just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that in this world,</v>

185
00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.580
<v Speaker 1>fostering traits such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness,</v>

186
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:37.473
<v Speaker 1>openness and adaptability are becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly important and for the time </v>

187
00:09:40.541 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>being divvied small countries seem to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>even more efficient at this and not just</v>

188
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:47.080
<v Speaker 1>small countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even cities.</v>

189
00:09:47.110 --> 00:09:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard me right there and I'll.</v>

190
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:51.700
<v Speaker 1>Wells big cities have become the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important economic growth</v>

191
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:55.140
<v Speaker 2>drivers just includes</v>

192
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:56.790
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York City,</v>

193
00:09:56.850 --> 00:09:57.750
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>

194
00:09:57.770 --> 00:09:58.603
<v Speaker 1>Macau cities that playing an </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly important role in our </v>

195
00:10:00.961 --> 00:10:02.340
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy of Jakarta,</v>

196
00:10:02.341 --> 00:10:03.174
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>grows twice as much as Indonesia as </v>

197
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:05.694
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York's GDP is twice that of Sweden </v>

198
00:10:07.380 --> 00:10:08.213
<v Speaker 1>and the countries that have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of the population living in </v>

199
00:10:11.101 --> 00:10:15.380
<v Speaker 1>cities tend to be richer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that leaves me wondering,</v>

200
00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.273
<v Speaker 1>based on that information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't we all have that on smaller </v>

201
00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 1>decentralized states for even give </v>
<v Speaker 1>cities some measure of independence?</v>

202
00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:24.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll just leave that thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

203
00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:25.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

204
00:10:27.630 --> 00:10:28.463
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of this compares to the influence </v>

205
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.744
<v Speaker 1>that the development of supernational </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations have to address from </v>

206
00:10:33.241 --> 00:10:35.790
<v Speaker 1>terrorism to caring for the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

207
00:10:35.791 --> 00:10:36.624
<v Speaker 1>What do you think is better wells with </v>
<v Speaker 1>several small countries or a weld with </v>

208
00:10:39.511 --> 00:10:42.390
<v Speaker 1>just a few launch one?</v>
