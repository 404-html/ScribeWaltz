<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:11.640
<v Speaker 2>They were visual politic when not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly massive fans of Donald Trump.</v>

3
00:00:11.641 --> 00:00:13.800
<v Speaker 2>As viewers of our Spanish language </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>

4
00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:14.634
<v Speaker 2>we'll note particularly however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is one area where we must admit </v>

5
00:00:18.301 --> 00:00:23.190
<v Speaker 2>the Donald Trump is absolutely correct.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to be a citizen of Mexico,</v>

6
00:00:23.191 --> 00:00:25.820
<v Speaker 2>you and let's assume you're a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>person,</v>

7
00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:27.170
<v Speaker 2>okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You want to be,</v>

8
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.940
<v Speaker 2>you could not become a citizen of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

9
00:00:28.941 --> 00:00:31.430
<v Speaker 2>It's the hardest place just about in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

10
00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:34.490
<v Speaker 2>in the world to become a citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

11
00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump is telling the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico has an immigration policy that is</v>

12
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 2>way more restrictive than the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

13
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.253
<v Speaker 2>To understand this Pesa in 2015 the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican government is kicked out of its </v>

14
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:47.450
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>100,000</v>

15
00:00:47.451 --> 00:00:49.820
<v Speaker 2>foreign is one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the neighbor to the north kicks out</v>

16
00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 2>of 300 thousands okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so actually on the face of things,</v>

17
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 2>it looks as if the u s deports more </v>
<v Speaker 2>people than Mexico.</v>

18
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean 300,000</v>

19
00:00:56.991 --> 00:00:57.824
<v Speaker 2>versus 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you really must think about this in </v>

20
00:00:59.991 --> 00:01:00.824
<v Speaker 2>relative terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but one Mexico's population is three </v>

21
00:01:03.141 --> 00:01:03.974
<v Speaker 2>times smaller than the United States and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's also a far less attractive </v>

22
00:01:06.831 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 2>destination for immigrant.</v>

23
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>That's it.</v>

24
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:18.073
<v Speaker 2>We can say that the Mexican authorities </v>
<v Speaker 2>deport nearly everyone who crosses into </v>

25
00:01:21.891 --> 00:01:22.724
<v Speaker 2>the country through their southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>border with the leaves and Guatemala is </v>

26
00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:26.744
<v Speaker 2>that is the deport all of the people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>decide to stay in Mexico rather than </v>

27
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:31.460
<v Speaker 2>heading further north to the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>

28
00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.353
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while America has an immigrant </v>

29
00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:37.790
<v Speaker 2>population of 14% which is by the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>average in terms of developed countries,</v>

30
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 2>Mexico has an immigrant population on </v>
<v Speaker 2>just one.</v>

31
00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:46.203
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

32
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 2>well the Mexican presidents on Recap </v>
<v Speaker 2>Pinion,</v>

33
00:01:49.301 --> 00:01:54.301
<v Speaker 2>yet always saying this to Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll make you or Nesta,</v>

34
00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.040
<v Speaker 2>Mexicans living in us are honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hardworking people.</v>

35
00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.310
<v Speaker 2>They are good people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They respect family,</v>

36
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.970
<v Speaker 2>they respect their communities and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>deserve respect,</v>

37
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.013
<v Speaker 2>will make you medicine and respectful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They told us 48% of the Mexican </v>

38
00:02:14.021 --> 00:02:14.854
<v Speaker 2>population holds a negative or very </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative opinion about immigrants from </v>

39
00:02:18.451 --> 00:02:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Central America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

40
00:02:19.951 --> 00:02:24.180
<v Speaker 2>in 2016 a Mexican newspaper called La,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yana published the following,</v>

41
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 3>yes</v>

42
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.770
<v Speaker 2>to the border wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the south of Mexico,</v>

43
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.143
<v Speaker 2>the problems between the u s and Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 2>can be solved by building a border like </v>

44
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:36.584
<v Speaker 2>the one proposed by Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the south so we can keep illegal </v>

45
00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 2>aliens out of Central American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's so rather interesting.</v>

46
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.150
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's why in today's visual politic</v>

47
00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:46.984
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>were you going to be looking in to </v>

48
00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:49.890
<v Speaker 2>Mexico's immigration policy?</v>

49
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:52.680
<v Speaker 3>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why does</v>

50
00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.830
<v Speaker 2>Mexico Deport Central American </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants?</v>

51
00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:56.693
<v Speaker 2>The first thing that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 2>understand before talking about </v>

52
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.690
<v Speaker 2>immigration to is their geographical </v>
<v Speaker 2>location.</v>

53
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.583
<v Speaker 2>What's imagine that you live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicaragua and you want to move to the </v>

54
00:03:05.021 --> 00:03:07.720
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's also say that you have no money to</v>

55
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>purchase a plane tickets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

56
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:10.504
<v Speaker 2>the only way for you to get from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicaragua to the United States is by </v>

57
00:03:13.691 --> 00:03:16.590
<v Speaker 2>land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means going through Mexico.</v>

58
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.463
<v Speaker 2>Currently,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest flow of immigrants in the </v>

59
00:03:18.971 --> 00:03:21.790
<v Speaker 2>world is from Central America to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

60
00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.960
<v Speaker 2>And and 15 alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over 22 million people made this trip.</v>

61
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.943
<v Speaker 2>It's an extremely dangerous journey on </v>
<v Speaker 2>roads that are in terrible condition as </v>

62
00:03:34.221 --> 00:03:37.610
<v Speaker 2>immigrants also passed through some </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredibly violent areas.</v>

63
00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.470
<v Speaker 2>And don't forget Mexican states like </v>
<v Speaker 2>chip pass ski area.</v>

64
00:03:40.471 --> 00:03:43.010
<v Speaker 2>When a lower the hotspots for drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>trafficking,</v>

65
00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:48.800
<v Speaker 2>they suffer all kinds of abuses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>extortion,</v>

66
00:03:48.801 --> 00:03:50.840
<v Speaker 2>kidnapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human trafficking,</v>

67
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:53.880
<v Speaker 2>drug trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>human and sexual slavery.</v>

68
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:57.170
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you understand this best when some of</v>

69
00:03:57.171 --> 00:03:58.004
<v Speaker 2>the immigrants arrive in the south of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico and they have to continue that </v>

70
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:03.380
<v Speaker 2>journey to the US on the reef of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>train?</v>

71
00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.590
<v Speaker 2>This train has become known as the beast</v>
<v Speaker 2>or the death train,</v>

72
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's not hard to figure out why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With Amenia key,</v>

73
00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.920
<v Speaker 2>this is why some immigrants' decide to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stay in Mexico.</v>

74
00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>This situation was the perfect excuse </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the Mexican government to pass it,</v>

75
00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.510
<v Speaker 2>the lady to properly RCR or population </v>
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>

76
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:21.403
<v Speaker 2>This was passed in the mid 1970s the law</v>
<v Speaker 2>was Paulie put in place in order to </v>

77
00:04:25.281 --> 00:04:26.114
<v Speaker 2>restrict the flow of immigrants to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country in order to avoid human </v>

78
00:04:29.031 --> 00:04:29.864
<v Speaker 2>trafficking and abuse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So this sounds like a well intentioned </v>

79
00:04:32.421 --> 00:04:34.370
<v Speaker 2>law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly was the problem?</v>

80
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's it first appeared to be something</v>

81
00:04:36.471 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 2>good for foreigners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It quickly became hell for them.</v>

82
00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.763
<v Speaker 2>And now you might be wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly made this law quite so bad for </v>

83
00:04:42.711 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

84
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:44.534
<v Speaker 2>quite simply,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it gave the government the power to </v>

85
00:04:45.561 --> 00:04:48.560
<v Speaker 2>expel foreigners or reasons as ludicrous</v>
<v Speaker 2>as this one,</v>

86
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.433
<v Speaker 2>the secretary can the knife 40 nurse and</v>
<v Speaker 2>trans to the country or change the </v>

87
00:04:56.221 --> 00:04:57.054
<v Speaker 2>quality or characteristics of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>migration in order to keep at </v>

88
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:01.404
<v Speaker 2>demographic balance and otherwise Mexico</v>
<v Speaker 2>only once immigrants from wealthy </v>

89
00:05:06.121 --> 00:05:08.190
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if possible,</v>

90
00:05:08.191 --> 00:05:10.710
<v Speaker 2>it's better if this skin is white as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

91
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.300
<v Speaker 2>What's the result of all this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

92
00:05:12.301 --> 00:05:17.301
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that seven out of every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants to Mexico off from the United</v>

93
00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:18.480
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And what about the rest of them?</v>

94
00:05:18.481 --> 00:05:21.300
<v Speaker 2>What about that other three wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're mostly from Spain.</v>

95
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 2>In fact in Mexican has twice as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spaniards living in it does it?</v>

96
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:25.194
<v Speaker 2>Does Guatemala.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this wouldn't exactly be a big </v>

97
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:28.254
<v Speaker 2>surprise except for the fact of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Guatemala shares a border with Mexico </v>

98
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.800
<v Speaker 2>and Spain is thousands of miles away </v>
<v Speaker 2>across in,</v>

99
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.963
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

100
00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.593
<v Speaker 2>This is not all Mexico has an equal </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of German immigrants as it does </v>

101
00:05:43.931 --> 00:05:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Peruvians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you come from Europe or the United</v>

102
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.603
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to have no problem getting </v>

103
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 2>a visa for Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lee,</v>

104
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 2>your helping to improve that demographic</v>
<v Speaker 2>balance.</v>

105
00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:56.183
<v Speaker 2>But if you happen to be from Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to live in the country of Robert </v>

106
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:00.313
<v Speaker 2>Rodriguez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well good luck to the Mexican </v>

107
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You on nothing more than a demographic</v>

108
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:05.483
<v Speaker 1>rats.</v>

109
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.383
<v Speaker 2>Hold on for a second because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more according to the previous and he </v>

110
00:06:13.151 --> 00:06:13.984
<v Speaker 2>mentions law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Being an immigrant in Mexico is a </v>

111
00:06:16.961 --> 00:06:17.794
<v Speaker 2>felony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that at any moments of </v>

112
00:06:19.271 --> 00:06:20.104
<v Speaker 2>federal agents can request your </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation and if you don't have the </v>

113
00:06:22.961 --> 00:06:24.700
<v Speaker 2>documentation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can be forced to leave.</v>

114
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:29.010
<v Speaker 2>Country ends pay a fine of two months </v>
<v Speaker 2>average salary in Mexico.</v>

115
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:29.611
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

116
00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:30.840
<v Speaker 2>so now you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

117
00:06:30.841 --> 00:06:33.450
<v Speaker 2>every country gets to determine its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration policy,</v>

118
00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.463
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's absolutely right and until </v>

119
00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:36.834
<v Speaker 2>2010 no other governments complains </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Mexico's immigration policy in </v>

120
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:45.700
<v Speaker 2>2010 something happens that embarrassed </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire night.</v>

121
00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:47.043
<v Speaker 1>Patient,</v>

122
00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.480
<v Speaker 2>governor Jan Brewer on Friday signed the</v>
<v Speaker 2>states immigration bill in low.</v>

123
00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 2>It is considered to be among the </v>
<v Speaker 2>toughest legislation in the nation.</v>

124
00:06:57.620 --> 00:06:58.453
<v Speaker 2>As ironic as it sounds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that rezone a law which was meant to </v>

125
00:07:00.861 --> 00:07:01.694
<v Speaker 2>stop immigrants from Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was a copy of that same Mexican law </v>

126
00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:06.343
<v Speaker 2>birds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually in practice it was slightly </v>

127
00:07:07.641 --> 00:07:09.230
<v Speaker 2>less extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

128
00:07:09.231 --> 00:07:10.064
<v Speaker 2>while Arizona's government considers it </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be a felony to be an illegal </v>

129
00:07:13.221 --> 00:07:15.620
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really matter because Arizona</v>

130
00:07:15.621 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>State's law doesn't apply to the federal</v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

131
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 2>so the reality was the federal police </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do nothing.</v>

132
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.123
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>vis law caught the attention of the </v>

133
00:07:23.571 --> 00:07:24.404
<v Speaker 2>world's media and the president of bank </v>
<v Speaker 2>then Philippe cals around didn't remain </v>

134
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:32.681
<v Speaker 2>silence doll that gets the same brain </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] collection,</v>

135
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:33.963
<v Speaker 2>criminalizes immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>social phenomenon and economic </v>

136
00:07:37.181 --> 00:07:38.014
<v Speaker 2>phenomena.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every load that penalizes it opening up </v>

137
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:46.440
<v Speaker 2>the door for intolerance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>discrimination as well.</v>

138
00:07:47.141 --> 00:07:49.270
<v Speaker 2>There you have it since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>day diction.</v>

139
00:07:49.271 --> 00:07:50.104
<v Speaker 2>Reason next to the word hypocrisy have </v>
<v Speaker 2>started including a picture of Philippe </v>

140
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.673
<v Speaker 2>Calderon wrong and quickly following </v>
<v Speaker 2>this statement came the world's </v>

141
00:07:56.711 --> 00:07:57.544
<v Speaker 2>reaction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Mexican government were forced to </v>

142
00:07:59.141 --> 00:08:01.660
<v Speaker 2>change to that population law that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned.</v>

143
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:02.523
<v Speaker 2>This meant that immigration to Mexico </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't no longer eight felony was do </v>

144
00:08:05.911 --> 00:08:08.640
<v Speaker 2>hold on that for just one second because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is not the end of us.</v>

145
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:09.673
<v Speaker 1>Boring.</v>

146
00:08:13.150 --> 00:08:13.901
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is true.</v>

147
00:08:13.901 --> 00:08:17.440
<v Speaker 2>The Mexico changed its immigration law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it didn't diesel entirely.</v>

148
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:18.523
<v Speaker 2>Remember when I said to the Mexican </v>
<v Speaker 2>federal police can request the </v>

149
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 2>documentation of any person at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

150
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.280
<v Speaker 2>that is still happening today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today in the United States,</v>

151
00:08:27.281 --> 00:08:29.890
<v Speaker 2>the authorities need to suspect you of </v>
<v Speaker 2>committing a crime.</v>

152
00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:31.750
<v Speaker 2>If they want to ask you the </v>
<v Speaker 2>documentation,</v>

153
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:35.170
<v Speaker 2>this means is over and easy for them to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop you on the street and to rescue for</v>

154
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.060
<v Speaker 2>being then legal immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

155
00:08:37.061 --> 00:08:37.894
<v Speaker 2>down in Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is happening every single day adds </v>

156
00:08:40.691 --> 00:08:41.524
<v Speaker 2>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The limited control over the country </v>

157
00:08:42.431 --> 00:08:45.310
<v Speaker 2>have over their own police force and you</v>
<v Speaker 2>get stories like this.</v>

158
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.490
<v Speaker 1>Escape</v>

159
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.323
<v Speaker 2>deportation migrants often pay bribes to</v>
<v Speaker 2>inm agents of between and $300 and of </v>

160
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.434
<v Speaker 2>course the mass deportations of Central </v>
<v Speaker 2>American immigrants remain exactly the </v>

161
00:09:01.081 --> 00:09:01.914
<v Speaker 2>same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you really think that Mexico is </v>

162
00:09:03.511 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 2>the only place where this is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because the answer is absolutely not.</v>

163
00:09:07.980 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Normally when we talk about immigration,</v>

164
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 2>we're normally talking about people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are living in a poor country,</v>

165
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.400
<v Speaker 2>moving to a rich country.</v>

166
00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:24.250
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

167
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:25.543
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's in 2015 over 80 million people </v>

168
00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:31.370
<v Speaker 2>moved from one poor country to a another</v>
<v Speaker 2>poor country.</v>

169
00:09:31.430 --> 00:09:32.263
<v Speaker 2>They were just moving to a poor country </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is slightly better off than that </v>

170
00:09:35.121 --> 00:09:36.920
<v Speaker 2>original country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As an example,</v>

171
00:09:36.921 --> 00:09:37.754
<v Speaker 2>every year thousands of people move from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bangladesh to India and the authorities </v>

172
00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.090
<v Speaker 2>don't exactly welcomed them with open </v>
<v Speaker 2>arms.</v>

173
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:44.953
<v Speaker 2>Just consider what Narendra Modi sets </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Indian presidents when he was </v>

174
00:09:47.871 --> 00:09:48.704
<v Speaker 2>running for office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can write it down after Mexico </v>

175
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:59.020
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] these Bangladeshis better be</v>
<v Speaker 2>prepared with their backs packed.</v>

176
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.143
<v Speaker 2>This is really a big difference when </v>
<v Speaker 2>compared to the immigrant friendly </v>

177
00:10:03.031 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 2>policies of countries like Canada or New</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zealand,</v>

178
00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.540
<v Speaker 2>which by the way are some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthiest countries in the world.</v>

179
00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:18.330
<v Speaker 2>This is just our opinion here at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual politic and we would love to know</v>

180
00:10:18.331 --> 00:10:19.164
<v Speaker 2>what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that Europe and the United </v>

181
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.540
<v Speaker 2>States should follow examples set by </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like Mexico and India,</v>

182
00:10:24.660 --> 00:10:28.260
<v Speaker 2>or follow the examples of countries like</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada and New Zealand?</v>
