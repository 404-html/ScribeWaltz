1
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.150
<v Speaker 1>If you to invest your money in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

2
00:00:10.151 --> 00:00:13.690
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure Venezuela wouldn't even be on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the list.</v>

3
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Rice wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you a government,</v>

4
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.350
<v Speaker 1>it does not agree with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China agrees to invest $20,</v>

5
00:00:23.281 --> 00:00:27.300
<v Speaker 1>million dollars in Venezuela to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>offset effects of oil price slump.</v>

6
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>But hold on just a second because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not only about China.</v>

7
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.883
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of Goldman Sachs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of those banks that symbolizes </v>

8
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:37.770
<v Speaker 1>American capitalism at its purest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.120
<v Speaker 1>they too saw a lot of business </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity as in Madeira.</v>

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela buys two point $8,000,000,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of Venezuelan bonds and an uproar </v>

11
00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:50.580
<v Speaker 1>begins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

12
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.443
<v Speaker 1>you heard that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Venezuela is having one of the </v>

13
00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:55.860
<v Speaker 1>worst economic catastrophes humanity has</v>
<v Speaker 1>ever witnessed,</v>

14
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.460
<v Speaker 1>they keep making deals with the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest investors.</v>

15
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.500
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the scarcity,</v>

16
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.200
<v Speaker 1>the extreme poverty and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation,</v>

17
00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:05.093
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Maduro is buying state of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>art weapons do maintain an army that </v>

18
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>almost nobody could attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Amit,</v>

19
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.093
<v Speaker 1>that has over 1000 rockets that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufactured in Russia in October of </v>

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 2017.</v>

21
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.250
<v Speaker 1>Madeira met Vladimir Putin to buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

22
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

23
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.630
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Venezuela is also the biggest partner</v>

24
00:01:25.631 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>that China has in the region they ever </v>
<v Speaker 1>received,</v>

25
00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>way more trainees money than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin American country.</v>

26
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.030
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>

27
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of all of this?</v>

28
00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance wise,</v>

29
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.910
<v Speaker 1>China is pretty blinds to ideology and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same goes for those American banks.</v>

30
00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.263
<v Speaker 1>The only goal is to make money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at first sight and in Venezuela it </v>

31
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.180
<v Speaker 1>doesn't exactly look like a great place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do business.</v>

32
00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.990
<v Speaker 1>How did Venezuela come to the attention </v>
<v Speaker 1>of so many investors?</v>

33
00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the deal here?</v>

34
00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer all of </v>

35
00:02:00.041 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

36
00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.080
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

37
00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:08.733
<v Speaker 1>so here's some advice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you ever wanted to become a dictator </v>

38
00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>in your country and repress your </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinions and torture,</v>

39
00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.360
<v Speaker 1>you'll many political foes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is something you absolutely need,</v>

40
00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.550
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that is money.</v>

41
00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.860
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal citizens can die from starvation,</v>

42
00:02:20.861 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but your beliefs and your army cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>miss a single payday.</v>

43
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.233
<v Speaker 1>This is the biggest problem for an </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian leader like Nicolas </v>

44
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.490
<v Speaker 1>Maduro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Venezuelan presidents,</v>

45
00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.640
<v Speaker 1>his biggest problem is if the army </v>
<v Speaker 1>decides to striking</v>

46
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.473
<v Speaker 2>against</v>

47
00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.160
<v Speaker 1>following visual politic for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

48
00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.023
<v Speaker 1>you know that Venezuela has almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>private company is say there's not much </v>

49
00:02:45.571 --> 00:02:46.404
<v Speaker 1>money to be collected in taxes for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil exports are no longer profitable </v>

50
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:53.550
<v Speaker 1>since the oil prices went down in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

51
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:57.630
<v Speaker 1>his only way to pay for this whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>repressive apparatus is by getting loans</v>

52
00:02:57.631 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>on the international market.</v>

53
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.640
<v Speaker 1>Hold on just a second here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are not as easy as they seem.</v>

54
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is a country with terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic problems.</v>

55
00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.360
<v Speaker 1>This means if you lend them money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chances are you're never going to get it</v>

56
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:15.223
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why we say the Venezuelan bonds </v>

57
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.580
<v Speaker 1>are a very high risk investments as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

58
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:23.240
<v Speaker 1>but to countries do when investors don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>trust them.</v>

59
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:24.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they raised the interest rates and this </v>

60
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:26.654
<v Speaker 1>is why Venezuelan bonds have a yield of </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 10 and 12 percent while a German </v>

61
00:03:30.441 --> 00:03:32.420
<v Speaker 1>bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is way more reliable.</v>

62
00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:34.790
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't surpass zero point five </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

63
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.640
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does all of this means?</v>

64
00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:37.543
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine we invest a thousand US </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars in Venezuelan bonds to be paid </v>

65
00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:43.220
<v Speaker 1>in 10 years with an interest of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

66
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.800
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan government is expected to</v>

67
00:03:45.801 --> 00:03:48.260
<v Speaker 1>give us back those thousand dollars that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we lead them,</v>

68
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.250
<v Speaker 1>but in the meantime you'll receive $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year as an interest payment.</v>

69
00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.001
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

70
00:03:53.001 --> 00:03:54.230
<v Speaker 1>I can probably guess what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>

71
00:03:54.231 --> 00:03:56.030
<v Speaker 1>That sounds like a pretty great </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

72
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:57.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you notice,</v>

73
00:03:57.141 --> 00:04:02.141
<v Speaker 1>get excited just yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said before,</v>

74
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.930
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela has a pretty high chance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>default.</v>

75
00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:07.943
<v Speaker 1>If the governments of Caracas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the capital of Venezuela declares </v>

76
00:04:10.561 --> 00:04:11.394
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy and say two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to have lost 80 percent of </v>

77
00:04:14.161 --> 00:04:14.994
<v Speaker 1>our investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why despite the high interest </v>

78
00:04:17.221 --> 00:04:18.054
<v Speaker 1>rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Maduro has founded harder and </v>

79
00:04:19.501 --> 00:04:22.320
<v Speaker 1>harder to sell his bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amds well,</v>

80
00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>this explains news like this.</v>

81
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.730
<v Speaker 2>Goldman Sachs,</v>

82
00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:30.950
<v Speaker 1>it's Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bond purchase sparks anger.</v>

83
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>It paid about $865,000,000 for two point</v>
<v Speaker 1>$8,000,000,000 worth of bonds.</v>

84
00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what does this mean?</v>

85
00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means Goldman Sachs bought Venezuelan</v>

86
00:04:41.331 --> 00:04:44.300
<v Speaker 1>bonds for a third of their value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

87
00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.163
<v Speaker 1>theoretically the government of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is expected to pay back two </v>

88
00:04:47.931 --> 00:04:48.764
<v Speaker 1>point $8,000,000,000 to Goldman Sachs </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that they only paid </v>

89
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 1>$865 million US dollars for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering,</v>

90
00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:58.940
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does Venezuela accept this deal?</v>

91
00:04:59.000 --> 00:04:59.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is simply because they need </v>

92
00:05:00.861 --> 00:05:03.650
<v Speaker 1>cash or they needed as soon as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>

93
00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.220
<v Speaker 1>they also know they're never going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen</v>

94
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.623
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

95
00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering,</v>

96
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.100
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did bank is lend them the money?</v>

97
00:05:15.101 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>If they know they're not going to get it</v>
<v Speaker 1>back?</v>

98
00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.973
<v Speaker 1>Whereas the business appeal here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so basically this appeal bias and </v>

99
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:21.990
<v Speaker 1>interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

100
00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:24.130
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Venezuela against Goldman Sachs,</v>

101
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>10 percent of those two point 8 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

102
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>and that means the bank will have </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered that investments,</v>

103
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>those $865 million dollars in less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>three years,</v>

104
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>and after that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is profit.</v>

105
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.453
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investors know that Venezuela is going </v>

106
00:05:38.621 --> 00:05:39.454
<v Speaker 1>to default.</v>

107
00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.640
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

108
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>question here is when are they going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do it?</v>

109
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.250
<v Speaker 1>So investors are making a high risk that</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet it found a swale.</v>

110
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:52.560
<v Speaker 1>It keeps paying for at least four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banks will win if they don't,</v>

111
00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.350
<v Speaker 1>the banks will lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is,</v>

112
00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Maduro is the first one </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in not bankruptcy.</v>

113
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.993
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he needs to keep bankers on his side so </v>

114
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.690
<v Speaker 1>he can pay his repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machinery.</v>

115
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.570
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PDV s,</v>

116
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>a Venezuela's state owned oil company </v>
<v Speaker 1>has several properties abroad,</v>

117
00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 1>trees and refineries in countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haiti and the Dominican Republic.</v>

118
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:19.063
<v Speaker 1>If Caracas defaults,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those investors might seize </v>

119
00:06:21.471 --> 00:06:22.460
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is white.</v>

120
00:06:22.461 --> 00:06:23.294
<v Speaker 1>For several years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela has prioritized that debt </v>

121
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:28.040
<v Speaker 1>payments over anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maduro is foreign.</v>

122
00:06:28.041 --> 00:06:30.470
<v Speaker 1>Currency reserves went from more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,</v>

123
00:06:30.471 --> 00:06:31.304
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars to less than 10 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this explains why a magazine like </v>

124
00:06:34.911 --> 00:06:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Forbes said this about Venezuelan bonds </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2016</v>

125
00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:39.703
<v Speaker 2>steam.</v>

126
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela might be the worst country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America,</v>

127
00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>but it's bonds look great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the middle of 2017,</v>

128
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.124
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump had to pass a law banning </v>
<v Speaker 1>American banks and hedge funds from </v>

129
00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.350
<v Speaker 1>investing in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

130
00:06:54.351 --> 00:06:58.880
<v Speaker 1>no matter how badly maduro tried,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his economy was weaker than he thought.</v>

131
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela to restructure foreign debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>default looms as possibility.</v>

132
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had that right.</v>

133
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:07.844
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs and the rest of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge funds who bought a Venezuelan </v>

134
00:07:10.301 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Speaker 1>bonds at a discount price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've lost their best.</v>

135
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:14.073
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is still one investor that is far </v>

136
00:07:15.791 --> 00:07:19.570
<v Speaker 1>from being worried and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we're talking about China.</v>

137
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.590
<v Speaker 1>China's puppet as we said at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

138
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is the country that received </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most Chinese money in Latin America.</v>

139
00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:32.590
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the private bankers,</v>

140
00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>China's government does not buy bonds on</v>

141
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:35.763
<v Speaker 2>markets.</v>

142
00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:38.443
<v Speaker 1>Instead she drink thing as a personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting with Nicolas Maduro and meeting </v>

143
00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.713
<v Speaker 1>where they negotiated a very special </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal alone that is not to be paid back </v>

144
00:07:46.611 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 1>with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with oil this way.</v>

145
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 1>Beijing makes sure they have an oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplier,</v>

146
00:07:51.620 --> 00:07:54.020
<v Speaker 1>no matter what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all of them.</v>

147
00:07:54.021 --> 00:07:55.430
<v Speaker 1>A second tip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this formula,</v>

148
00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>it's got its drawbacks too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

149
00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:01.480
<v Speaker 1>PDVSA is a hyper bureaucratic company </v>
<v Speaker 1>with thousands of workers,</v>

150
00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>hard by Chavez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of pure nepotism.</v>

151
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>Oil drilling is harder and harder for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

152
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:14.140
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need those dinosaur juice shipments</v>

153
00:08:14.141 --> 00:08:18.220
<v Speaker 1>are arriving pretty late to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite all of that,</v>

154
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.203
<v Speaker 1>China keeps them loyalty to Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was showing solidarity with the </v>

155
00:08:25.181 --> 00:08:26.014
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan people because we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting the principals of the United </v>

156
00:08:29.230 --> 00:08:32.330
<v Speaker 1>Nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we have to do that.</v>

157
00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.690
<v Speaker 1>So now the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:35.613
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does China get from Venezuela now </v>

159
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>that they are facing problems with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>while payments?</v>

160
00:08:39.970 --> 00:08:42.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer lies in the long run.</v>

161
00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing has already lent $50,</v>

162
00:08:44.830 --> 00:08:45.663
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars to crack us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they just need patients and </v>

163
00:08:48.341 --> 00:08:49.174
<v Speaker 1>stability.</v>

164
00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:52.070
<v Speaker 2>Missouri Madeira</v>

165
00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.390
<v Speaker 1>needs some years to pay back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that?</v>

166
00:08:53.391 --> 00:08:55.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no rush project Mangan waste.</v>

167
00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:56.223
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something that could risk the </v>

168
00:08:57.691 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>payback of these debts and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing governments.</v>

169
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if the opposition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Maduro took power?</v>

170
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:07.110
<v Speaker 1>Would they be willing to meet their </v>
<v Speaker 1>obligations?</v>

171
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:08.820
<v Speaker 1>Do they use you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps the dictator,</v>

172
00:09:08.880 --> 00:09:11.460
<v Speaker 1>the one who sent them to jail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably tortured them.</v>

173
00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:14.430
<v Speaker 1>Sounds like a pretty risky proposition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nan's well,</v>

174
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:15.293
<v Speaker 1>risk is the least favorite word for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese Communist Party and it explains </v>

175
00:09:19.861 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>things like this</v>

176
00:09:24.450 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>that is really defends purchase of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese right control gear.</v>

177
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.120
<v Speaker 1>After more than 70 deaths in street </v>
<v Speaker 1>protests,</v>

178
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:31.043
<v Speaker 1>China has already sold over $350,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars worth of weapons to </v>

179
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Madeira so that he can stay in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to things movements.</v>

180
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>Caracas is China's biggest ally in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

181
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:41.213
<v Speaker 1>Basically the Venezuelan government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become the puppets of the Chinese </v>

182
00:09:45.570 --> 00:09:46.460
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well.</v>

183
00:09:46.470 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>What happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

184
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.323
<v Speaker 1>maybe China wants to build new </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure in South America so they </v>

185
00:09:50.881 --> 00:09:53.570
<v Speaker 1>can complete that Silk Road project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While no problem,</v>

186
00:09:53.571 --> 00:09:54.404
<v Speaker 1>I'm in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diplomats will support them with no </v>

187
00:09:55.921 --> 00:09:56.754
<v Speaker 1>questions asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe China wants to have a military </v>

188
00:09:58.051 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 1>base in the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:01.470
<v Speaker 1>welcome to Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like that.</v>

190
00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 1>They'll get thousands of square miles to</v>
<v Speaker 1>place that Ami as they please.</v>

191
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:06.810
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

192
00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:10.070
<v Speaker 1>there isn't a better ally than the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>that needs you in order to survive.</v>

193
00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela hopes no country hinders </v>
<v Speaker 1>China's fantastic Silk Road initiative.</v>

194
00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:18.373
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that instilled dapcep having as much </v>

195
00:10:20.481 --> 00:10:21.314
<v Speaker 1>power as they have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China might request other kinds of </v>

196
00:10:23.481 --> 00:10:24.710
<v Speaker 1>reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

197
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:27.830
<v Speaker 1>if Venezuela that keeps facing problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that oil payments,</v>

198
00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:32.620
<v Speaker 1>they might force maduro too for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>at PD vsa and make it more productive.</v>

199
00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.380
<v Speaker 1>That could even take over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation of the old themselves.</v>

200
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:39.360
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

201
00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:43.410
<v Speaker 1>The question here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can Venezuela become China's colony?</v>

202
00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Do you think China is going to seize </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan oil forever?</v>

203
00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd love to know your answer and you </v>
