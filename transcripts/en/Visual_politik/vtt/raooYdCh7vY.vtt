<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.873
<v Speaker 2>China has started in what has been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greatest economic revolution in the </v>

3
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:15.250
<v Speaker 2>history of mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

4
00:00:15.251 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 2>in spite of this in 2017 both Moody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>and standard and Poor's,</v>

5
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.520
<v Speaker 2>two of the three main rating agencies </v>
<v Speaker 2>reduced the Chinese debt rating.</v>

6
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.863
<v Speaker 2>Brits pause.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The International Monetary Fund itself </v>

7
00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.670
<v Speaker 2>has been issuing warnings about this for</v>
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>

8
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Yet the Chinese economy is growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly,</v>

9
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.400
<v Speaker 2>but that does not mean everything is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going well.</v>

10
00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.240
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

11
00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.073
<v Speaker 2>In recent years as we've already </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed in a video that are linked to </v>

12
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:47.364
<v Speaker 2>you at the end,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China's economy has seen one parameter </v>

13
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>saw exponentially and that's corporate </v>
<v Speaker 2>debt and this isn't small news.</v>

14
00:00:56.261 --> 00:01:00.400
<v Speaker 2>Chinese corporate debt accounts for </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 170% of China's GDP.</v>

15
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.960
<v Speaker 2>To give you an idea of what this means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could say that this 170% GDP level is</v>

16
00:01:08.111 --> 00:01:10.800
<v Speaker 2>one of the highest on the planet and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a,</v>

17
00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>twice that of the United States.</v>

18
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.720
<v Speaker 2>Some of you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

19
00:01:23.721 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 2>if the Chinese economy seems to be doing</v>
<v Speaker 2>so well,</v>

20
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.660
<v Speaker 2>how did its companies accumulate such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge debt?</v>

21
00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that in recent years,</v>

22
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 2>Chinese companies have gone on a sort of</v>
<v Speaker 2>spending spree.</v>

23
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.563
<v Speaker 2>You all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've bought everything foreign </v>

24
00:01:37.491 --> 00:01:38.690
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ports,</v>

25
00:01:38.691 --> 00:01:39.650
<v Speaker 2>airports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>minds,</v>

26
00:01:39.651 --> 00:01:41.540
<v Speaker 2>railways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even soccer teams,</v>

27
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.960
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.900
<v Speaker 2>knees invasion seemed unstoppable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then that's precisely what caused to</v>

29
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:53.734
<v Speaker 2>so many countries do develop an </v>
<v Speaker 2>aggressive discourse against this kind </v>

30
00:01:57.311 --> 00:01:58.960
<v Speaker 2>of occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

31
00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 2>as the Chinese have begun investing in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the poorest countries in Africa,</v>

32
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.053
<v Speaker 2>many analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists and activists have accused </v>

33
00:02:06.431 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 2>Beijing of practicing this sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>colonialism.</v>

34
00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:13.150
<v Speaker 1>Do</v>

35
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.983
<v Speaker 2>beware,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because this phenomenon is really quite </v>

36
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 2>widespread.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies,</v>

37
00:02:16.241 --> 00:02:17.380
<v Speaker 2>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs,</v>

38
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:20.470
<v Speaker 2>government institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does not matter.</v>

39
00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.363
<v Speaker 2>In recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the obsession to get money out of China </v>

40
00:02:23.291 --> 00:02:27.760
<v Speaker 2>has been shared practically the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>every person in the Chinese economy now.</v>

41
00:02:27.761 --> 00:02:29.860
<v Speaker 2>So all these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the might now be thinking,</v>

42
00:02:29.861 --> 00:02:30.694
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese people buying all kinds of </v>

43
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:33.850
<v Speaker 2>things are important over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People in Beijing,</v>

44
00:02:33.851 --> 00:02:35.560
<v Speaker 2>they've got to be rubbing their hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

45
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.400
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

46
00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.233
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually nothing could be further from </v>

47
00:02:39.671 --> 00:02:40.570
<v Speaker 2>the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

48
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:41.433
<v Speaker 2>throughout the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xi Jinping's government has launched </v>

49
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.220
<v Speaker 2>many measures to stop this process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

50
00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.170
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm just a moment.</v>

51
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.013
<v Speaker 2>And the Beijing government actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to stop this Chinese purchase </v>

52
00:02:50.621 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 2>wave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

53
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.200
<v Speaker 2>protecting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wanting to take over the world.</v>

54
00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.660
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that they don't want to,</v>

55
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.750
<v Speaker 2>but they certainly do have their reasons</v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

56
00:02:58.751 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>So listen up.</v>

57
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.583
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

58
00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 2>Other face of Chinese investment we </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioned we want to invest abroad.</v>

59
00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:15.400
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can do it in many different ways.</v>

60
00:03:15.401 --> 00:03:16.234
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can buy debt from a foreign </v>

61
00:03:17.921 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a foreign company,</v>

62
00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:20.223
<v Speaker 2>from a foreign bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can also buy shares in another </v>

63
00:03:22.691 --> 00:03:23.830
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stock markets,</v>

64
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.723
<v Speaker 2>but we can also carry out what is known </v>
<v Speaker 2>as foreign direct investment that is by </v>

65
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:31.510
<v Speaker 2>a local company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>opened a store,</v>

66
00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 2>a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh workshop,</v>

67
00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.150
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

68
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invest in a real asset in field.</v>

69
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.083
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

70
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.013
<v Speaker 2>we gotta sneak a direct foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment implies a greater degree of </v>

71
00:03:45.601 --> 00:03:47.910
<v Speaker 2>complexity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly greater risk,</v>

72
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>which is why it's expected to generate </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater profitability.</v>

73
00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.250
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it wants,</v>

74
00:03:53.251 --> 00:03:55.680
<v Speaker 2>there would be no incentive to implement</v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

75
00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:56.603
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's infinitely easier to buy financial </v>

76
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:01.110
<v Speaker 2>assets while sitting in front of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>computer at the office,</v>

77
00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.570
<v Speaker 2>or even just in your pajamas hunting </v>
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>

78
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact is that paradoxically is this </v>

79
00:04:05.731 --> 00:04:07.620
<v Speaker 2>type of investment has grown in recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

80
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:08.454
<v Speaker 2>It's profitability has actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>plummeted according to China's stinked </v>

81
00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.830
<v Speaker 2>currency administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The rate of return,</v>

82
00:04:13.831 --> 00:04:18.831
<v Speaker 2>this type of investments profitability </v>
<v Speaker 2>dropped to barely 0.4% in 2016 oh.</v>

83
00:04:20.281 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 2>Despite the fact that almost every stock</v>
<v Speaker 2>market was skyrocketing.</v>

84
00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.913
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in spite of the colonial isn't </v>

85
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:31.983
<v Speaker 2>accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that many of the Chinese </v>

86
00:04:33.701 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 2>investment projects off working so </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly,</v>

87
00:04:36.161 --> 00:04:39.010
<v Speaker 2>but that more of a headache than a </v>
<v Speaker 2>business of the century.</v>

88
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.570
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>

89
00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:42.770
<v Speaker 2>Before you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

90
00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:44.030
<v Speaker 2>hold off a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon,</v>

91
00:04:44.031 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is the problem here?</v>

92
00:04:45.921 --> 00:04:48.470
<v Speaker 2>Is it simply that that dress making too </v>
<v Speaker 2>little money?</v>

93
00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:49.333
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to what we learned about </v>

94
00:04:51.021 --> 00:04:52.550
<v Speaker 2>corporate desk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

95
00:04:52.551 --> 00:04:53.384
<v Speaker 2>it is a large part of this huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>international expansion was financed </v>

96
00:04:56.391 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 2>with debt data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That,</v>

97
00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.843
<v Speaker 2>of course must be repaid with interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if the investments fail or don't </v>

98
00:05:01.821 --> 00:05:05.870
<v Speaker 2>generate the expected returns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could create a huge solvency problem,</v>

99
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:10.250
<v Speaker 2>which would obviously seriously affect </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese financial system,</v>

100
00:05:10.251 --> 00:05:12.350
<v Speaker 2>which belongs fundamentally to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

101
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.173
<v Speaker 2>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>v Signer Hydro and China Railway </v>

102
00:05:20.361 --> 00:05:21.194
<v Speaker 2>Engineering Corporation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>case to engineering and construction </v>

103
00:05:23.511 --> 00:05:25.790
<v Speaker 2>companies owned by the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

104
00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:26.663
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2007 they reached a huge agreements </v>

105
00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.163
<v Speaker 2>with the Congolese government in </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange for a concession to exploit </v>

106
00:05:32.751 --> 00:05:33.584
<v Speaker 2>copper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they committed to investing $9 </v>

107
00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 2>billion in the African country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>3 billion in the mine,</v>

108
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:39.374
<v Speaker 2>and 6 billion in infrastructure to </v>
<v Speaker 2>government owned companies that had </v>

109
00:05:42.201 --> 00:05:43.034
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with mining and we're </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely financed by a Chinese </v>

110
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.450
<v Speaker 2>government owned.</v>

111
00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 1>Thank you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These</v>

112
00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:54.183
<v Speaker 2>Chinese companies have already invested </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than $2 billion and so far </v>

113
00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.340
<v Speaker 2>everything's been a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The price of copper fell.</v>

114
00:05:59.341 --> 00:06:00.174
<v Speaker 2>The reserves went as big as expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The logistical costs were really high </v>

115
00:06:03.171 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 2>because they hadn't even guaranteed that</v>
<v Speaker 2>power supply.</v>

116
00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:09.440
<v Speaker 2>And of course all of this man's many </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs and many,</v>

117
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:10.303
<v Speaker 2>many delays.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only nine years later in 2016 were they </v>

118
00:06:13.281 --> 00:06:17.390
<v Speaker 2>able to start extracting copper in much </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower quantities and then extract it?</v>

119
00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:18.283
<v Speaker 2>So whatever the future holds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that during the last </v>

120
00:06:21.170 --> 00:06:22.730
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this agreements was a big headache,</v>

121
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 2>is a great sauce of losses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And don't think that this project was an</v>

122
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:31.280
<v Speaker 2>exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that in recent years,</v>

123
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.090
<v Speaker 2>Chinese companies government owns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's private companies alike,</v>

124
00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.033
<v Speaker 2>I've gotten into serious debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>buying all kinds of assets without </v>

125
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 2>caring about the price.</v>

126
00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 2>That is not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

127
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:44.953
<v Speaker 2>all these investments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean capital leaving the country at </v>

128
00:06:46.981 --> 00:06:47.814
<v Speaker 2>such a high rate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the between 2011 and the beginning of </v>

129
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:55.091
<v Speaker 2>2017 Chinese currency reserves plummeted</v>
<v Speaker 2>by $1 trillion.</v>

130
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:56.653
<v Speaker 2>And that my friends is a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's something that goes in the </v>

131
00:06:59.241 --> 00:07:00.074
<v Speaker 2>opposite direction of what Beijing one </v>
<v Speaker 2>switch in recent years trying to </v>

132
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:03.614
<v Speaker 2>strengthen the yuan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now we come to the question of why </v>

133
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:09.260
<v Speaker 2>are Chinese investors suit eager to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>money out of the country?</v>

134
00:07:09.410 --> 00:07:13.550
<v Speaker 2>Why do they seem so surprisingly bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to investing abroad?</v>

135
00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:14.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen up.</v>

136
00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

137
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Bad incentive.</v>

138
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

139
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:26.103
<v Speaker 2>So the fact that Chinese investors seems</v>
<v Speaker 2>so in competent when it comes to </v>

140
00:07:28.331 --> 00:07:32.040
<v Speaker 2>investing abroad is a matter of </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives and to be a rocker a,</v>

141
00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:36.480
<v Speaker 2>see the main priority for the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>who managed to make money is to transfer</v>

142
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:38.440
<v Speaker 2>part of birth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their assets abroad.</v>

143
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:39.970
<v Speaker 2>So why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 2>it's fundamentally a matter of legal.</v>

145
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.543
<v Speaker 1>Hello</v>

146
00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.500
<v Speaker 2>me to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

147
00:07:47.501 --> 00:07:51.730
<v Speaker 2>China is a dictatorship and that means </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if tomorrow you have a problem with</v>

148
00:07:51.731 --> 00:07:54.390
<v Speaker 2>the political power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your money could just disappear.</v>

149
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.860
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as in any dictatorship,</v>

150
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:00.550
<v Speaker 2>there are many restrictions because if </v>
<v Speaker 2>things go wrong,</v>

151
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.413
<v Speaker 2>what could be better?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And having part of your patron any </v>

152
00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>protected in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems pretty sensible rights.</v>

153
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:08.230
<v Speaker 2>I think most people would do it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

154
00:08:11.210 --> 00:08:13.600
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's</v>

155
00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.433
<v Speaker 2>one of the explanations for why so many </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese businessmen wanted to invest </v>

156
00:08:17.531 --> 00:08:18.364
<v Speaker 2>their money as quickly as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if it meant paying a premium may </v>

157
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:24.070
<v Speaker 2>sort of surcharge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that isn't the only reason.</v>

158
00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.963
<v Speaker 2>Additionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in recent years since 2008 the Chinese </v>

159
00:08:26.831 --> 00:08:27.664
<v Speaker 2>government promoted easy and cheap </v>
<v Speaker 2>credit has a mechanism to boost the </v>

160
00:08:30.281 --> 00:08:31.114
<v Speaker 2>economy and of course when you can get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into death under such favorable </v>

161
00:08:33.521 --> 00:08:34.354
<v Speaker 2>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be as demanding when </v>

162
00:08:35.871 --> 00:08:38.560
<v Speaker 2>selecting which projects to invest in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

163
00:08:38.561 --> 00:08:42.160
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the big problems with </v>
<v Speaker 2>expansive monetary policies.</v>

164
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:43.023
<v Speaker 2>They encourage bad investments that </v>
<v Speaker 2>later aren't really difficult to pay </v>

165
00:08:45.581 --> 00:08:47.000
<v Speaker 2>off,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hold on a moment.</v>

166
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:50.370
<v Speaker 2>The entity is most responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge slab of corporate dads to this.</v>

167
00:08:50.380 --> 00:08:52.510
<v Speaker 2>We've talked about have not been private</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

168
00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:54.790
<v Speaker 2>That's actually one's owned by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

169
00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:05.880
<v Speaker 2>And this though surprising also has a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot to do with incentives.</v>

170
00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:12.273
<v Speaker 2>See investing outside of the country in </v>
<v Speaker 2>large amounts men's cause that managers </v>

171
00:09:15.251 --> 00:09:16.084
<v Speaker 2>could puff up their chests before the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Beijing government view to the growth </v>

172
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:21.280
<v Speaker 2>that that companies had achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>

173
00:09:21.281 --> 00:09:23.410
<v Speaker 2>it meant many of these managers cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>can move on.</v>

174
00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So you ran another country and charged a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money.</v>

175
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:29.920
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that their interests are </v>
<v Speaker 2>different from those of their company.</v>

176
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.820
<v Speaker 2>Of course if business was done in </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries as complicated as Africa,</v>

177
00:09:40.850 --> 00:09:44.630
<v Speaker 2>it was also easier to take a slice gets </v>
<v Speaker 2>a commission,</v>

178
00:09:44.631 --> 00:09:45.970
<v Speaker 2>shall we say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

179
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.853
<v Speaker 2>Chinese state owned companies have huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucratic structures which makes </v>

180
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:54.080
<v Speaker 2>decision making and adapting to any </v>
<v Speaker 2>changes that may occur very,</v>

181
00:09:54.081 --> 00:09:55.080
<v Speaker 2>very slow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

182
00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 2>State owned companies tends to be much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more inefficient.</v>

183
00:09:58.650 --> 00:09:59.483
<v Speaker 2>While that's what's CG Peng wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>face up to while trying to consolidate </v>

184
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.133
<v Speaker 2>his power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dangerous Game [inaudible] this huge </v>

185
00:10:15.401 --> 00:10:16.234
<v Speaker 2>shopping mal strum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is often done without too much </v>

186
00:10:18.521 --> 00:10:23.200
<v Speaker 2>thought also happens in Japan in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1980s that is before the Greek crisis of</v>

187
00:10:23.201 --> 00:10:26.620
<v Speaker 2>the early nineties and in Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're terrified that something similar</v>

188
00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:29.590
<v Speaker 2>will happen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what do you think they did well,</v>

189
00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.483
<v Speaker 2>the introduced a lot of restrictions on </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign investments in such a way that </v>

190
00:10:33.221 --> 00:10:34.054
<v Speaker 2>now the Chinese government can veto </v>
<v Speaker 2>corporate operations abroad for Chinese </v>

191
00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:39.820
<v Speaker 2>companies even if they are carried out </v>
<v Speaker 2>by private companies.</v>

192
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:40.953
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

193
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.083
<v Speaker 2>this has a double intention because in </v>
<v Speaker 2>addition to cooling the foreign </v>

194
00:10:45.581 --> 00:10:49.060
<v Speaker 2>investment process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also strongly reinforces Xi Jinping's</v>

195
00:10:49.061 --> 00:10:49.894
<v Speaker 2>political power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see that with this excuse the </v>

196
00:10:51.401 --> 00:10:52.234
<v Speaker 2>Chinese government has taken and </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous mechanism out of its sleeve to </v>

197
00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.580
<v Speaker 2>reward friends and to punish the less </v>
<v Speaker 2>loyal.</v>

198
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.930
<v Speaker 2>In addition with the excuse of </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing control,</v>

199
00:11:01.931 --> 00:11:05.290
<v Speaker 2>Beijing is also promoting the merging of</v>
<v Speaker 2>government owned companies,</v>

200
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:06.143
<v Speaker 2>which until now works autonomously to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create huge corporations and this gives </v>

201
00:11:10.391 --> 00:11:12.340
<v Speaker 2>Beijing even more power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

202
00:11:12.341 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 2>all these actions can weigh on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth of Chinese companies.</v>

203
00:11:15.281 --> 00:11:16.114
<v Speaker 2>They can decrease competition and </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase the bureaucracy in efficiency </v>

204
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:22.270
<v Speaker 2>with which the Chinese public sector </v>
<v Speaker 2>operates.</v>

205
00:11:22.300 --> 00:11:26.200
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xi Jingping we'll get even more power.</v>

206
00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:34.650
<v Speaker 2>China has many strengths but this is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of its great weaknesses.</v>

207
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.543
<v Speaker 2>Even so Chinese savings are so high that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems difficult to reproduce a </v>

208
00:11:39.001 --> 00:11:42.090
<v Speaker 2>financial crisis like the one the Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced,</v>

209
00:11:42.091 --> 00:11:45.280
<v Speaker 2>but the risk certainly does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was your turn.</v>

210
00:11:45.281 --> 00:11:49.020
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that Xi Jinping's ambitions</v>
<v Speaker 2>well ends up hurting China?</v>

211
00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:49.913
