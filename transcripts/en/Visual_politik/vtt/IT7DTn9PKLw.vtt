1
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 1>We can't hide it here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic.</v>

2
00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 1>We Love Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

3
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.033
<v Speaker 1>that's poorly because we believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world sends him is already on this </v>

4
00:00:16.461 --> 00:00:21.461
<v Speaker 1>continent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the last few decades,</v>

5
00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:28.360
<v Speaker 1>one country has stood out of that crowd </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's country,</v>

6
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.470
<v Speaker 1>whether it's China</v>

7
00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.770
<v Speaker 1>for its huge size and the speed of which</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country is growing.</v>

8
00:00:36.771 --> 00:00:37.604
<v Speaker 1>China deserves to be given the chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in this super production that is </v>

9
00:00:40.551 --> 00:00:43.280
<v Speaker 1>changing our harness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait just a second,</v>

10
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.400
<v Speaker 1>let's not rush into this whole thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

11
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

12
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>The country has some pretty major </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

13
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>On the 23rd of May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

14
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.283
<v Speaker 1>Moody's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the three agencies in charge of </v>

15
00:00:56.031 --> 00:00:59.570
<v Speaker 1>rating the solvency and risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial products downgraded the rating</v>

16
00:00:59.571 --> 00:01:00.404
<v Speaker 1>of China's debt and this is the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction Moody's has made on China's </v>

17
00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:07.970
<v Speaker 1>debt in 27 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.833
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moody's really raising agencies in </v>

19
00:01:11.121 --> 00:01:11.954
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they rarely seem to get it right </v>

20
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.170
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while it is true,</v>

21
00:01:15.171 --> 00:01:17.180
<v Speaker 1>it is also one of the only things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to judge.</v>

22
00:01:17.181 --> 00:01:18.014
<v Speaker 1>This sort of thing is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly rely on standard and </v>

23
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Poor's Moody's and Fitch when deciding </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether to buy bonds,</v>

24
00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.190
<v Speaker 1>the three issue more than 95 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>global bond ratings.</v>

25
00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you view as China has faced two major</v>

26
00:01:31.881 --> 00:01:35.600
<v Speaker 1>threats in the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less growth and much,</v>

27
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.580
<v Speaker 1>much more debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

28
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:41.900
<v Speaker 1>this has even led to unimportant </v>
<v Speaker 1>question Cam China go back</v>

29
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.733
<v Speaker 2>crops.</v>

30
00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:47.023
<v Speaker 1>China's great growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we had a time machine and the </v>

31
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to travel back to Mao's </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

32
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.813
<v Speaker 1>the country we would find would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely different to the one that we </v>

33
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:58.340
<v Speaker 1>find today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be any skyscrapers,</v>

34
00:01:58.341 --> 00:01:59.870
<v Speaker 1>any malls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

35
00:01:59.871 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 1>there really wouldn't be much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything in the 19 seventies.</v>

36
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.380
<v Speaker 1>China was a mainly agricultural country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was extremely painful.</v>

37
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.080
<v Speaker 1>A few years often now had died and man </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as Dung Xiaoping came to power.</v>

38
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.650
<v Speaker 1>He realized that communism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:25.140
<v Speaker 1>it really hadn't worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all immediately put into practice a</v>

40
00:02:25.141 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>set of measures that would change China </v>
<v Speaker 1>for rather these reforms and be changed.</v>

41
00:02:29.811 --> 00:02:30.644
<v Speaker 1>The China has gone through since they're</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually going to be the subject of an </v>

42
00:02:32.311 --> 00:02:33.144
<v Speaker 1>upcoming visual politic video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so please don't forget to subscribe to </v>

43
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:40.821
<v Speaker 1>this channel right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

44
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.000
<v Speaker 1>done that well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's carry on for now.</v>

45
00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:46.980
<v Speaker 1>It's important to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember something done.</v>

46
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>Joe Ping was a turning point for China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

47
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:52.314
<v Speaker 1>China has undergone the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic revolution in the history of </v>

48
00:02:54.811 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>mankind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last three decades.</v>

49
00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 1>China has managed to take $500 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>out of poverty</v>

50
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.890
<v Speaker 3>and to become the largest industrial and</v>
<v Speaker 3>trading power on the planet.</v>

51
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.233
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we ask any Chinese person about his </v>

52
00:03:07.161 --> 00:03:07.994
<v Speaker 1>or her living standards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer will be now is infinitely </v>

53
00:03:11.331 --> 00:03:16.331
<v Speaker 1>better than it was before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please don't get me wrong,</v>

54
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.820
<v Speaker 1>there is still a lot of poverty in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

55
00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:24.980
<v Speaker 1>but compared to how it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a whole lot better today,</v>

56
00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.873
<v Speaker 1>but as long as I was saying earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not all roses and there </v>

57
00:03:28.401 --> 00:03:33.401
<v Speaker 1>are some serious clouds on the horizon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system addicted to debt.</v>

58
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>I'll be quick look at this chart which </v>
<v Speaker 1>shows what happens.</v>

59
00:03:39.971 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Do you Chinese debt in the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

60
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:48.220
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes up and up and up,</v>

61
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:48.911
<v Speaker 1>and I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

62
00:03:48.911 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>that's a seriously steep line on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other hands.</v>

63
00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.850
<v Speaker 1>Look closely at what has happened is do </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese economic growth.</v>

64
00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.030
<v Speaker 1>As you can see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this Charles,</v>

65
00:03:58.031 --> 00:04:02.320
<v Speaker 1>it's headed in the opposite direction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>

66
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>in China the economy is declining and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the debt wouldn't stop rising.</v>

67
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:12.200
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

68
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.033
<v Speaker 1>gross terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese debt as multiplying by four </v>

69
00:04:15.111 --> 00:04:16.520
<v Speaker 1>since 2017.</v>

70
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

71
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.863
<v Speaker 3>Chinese debt now equals more than 260 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the GDP and many analysts </v>

72
00:04:22.441 --> 00:04:23.274
<v Speaker 3>consider this number to be especially </v>
<v Speaker 3>high for a country that has yet to </v>

73
00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:26.640
<v Speaker 3>become one of the richest in the world.</v>

74
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the debt is actually the </v>

75
00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:31.290
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of Chinese company.</v>

76
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.233
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

77
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that is a silver lining,</v>

78
00:04:38.761 --> 00:04:42.440
<v Speaker 1>but there is also a significant negative</v>
<v Speaker 1>side and that is an.</v>

79
00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.130
<v Speaker 1>All this international expansion needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and swell and the great deal of it</v>

80
00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:48.043
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Much of the debt has financed the </v>

81
00:04:49.141 --> 00:04:49.974
<v Speaker 1>expansion of Chinese companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have also paid well for this kind </v>

82
00:04:52.921 --> 00:04:53.754
<v Speaker 1>of nonsense</v>

83
00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:55.783
<v Speaker 3>throughout China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There are hundreds of cities that have </v>

84
00:04:57.291 --> 00:05:00.020
<v Speaker 3>almost everything one needs for modern </v>
<v Speaker 3>urban lifestyle,</v>

85
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.973
<v Speaker 3>high rise apartment complexes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>developed waterfronts skyscrapers and </v>

86
00:05:03.981 --> 00:05:04.814
<v Speaker 3>even public art.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything that is except one major </v>

87
00:05:07.461 --> 00:05:08.260
<v Speaker 3>factor</v>

88
00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:09.093
<v Speaker 1>people so you can get some idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>size of all of it has been built in </v>

89
00:05:12.971 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 1>China in the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

90
00:05:14.621 --> 00:05:17.620
<v Speaker 1>attention to the following number.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In just three years,</v>

91
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.483
<v Speaker 1>China is used more concrete than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States used in the entire 20th </v>

92
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:23.944
<v Speaker 1>century and as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything absolutely everything has </v>

93
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:28.144
<v Speaker 1>been paid for with debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we come to a really important </v>

94
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:32.283
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell has happened in this </v>

95
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>country to cause it to get into quite so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much debt,</v>

96
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:41.213
<v Speaker 2>trainees,</v>

97
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:42.403
<v Speaker 3>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 3>forward</v>

98
00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:43.263
<v Speaker 2>flight</v>

99
00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.533
<v Speaker 1>the last few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you could say that Chinese people </v>

100
00:05:49.021 --> 00:05:52.320
<v Speaker 1>were good at one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it would be saving money.</v>

101
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 1>This is especially true if the oldest </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese citizens,</v>

102
00:05:55.411 --> 00:05:59.480
<v Speaker 1>they work and they save ends weld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is pretty much all they do.</v>

103
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>So thanks to all of that advert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has high investment rates,</v>

104
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>but don't be fooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has happened in the last few years,</v>

105
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:06.674
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence to know what has happened </v>

106
00:06:09.931 --> 00:06:12.710
<v Speaker 1>is we need to go back to 2008 at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

107
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.370
<v Speaker 1>all developed countries and we're going </v>
<v Speaker 1>through a major financial crisis and you</v>

108
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>can probably imagine how this affected </v>
<v Speaker 1>China's exports,</v>

109
00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.910
<v Speaker 1>which are the engine that keeps driving </v>
<v Speaker 1>China forward.</v>

110
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:27.860
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government was terrifying,</v>

111
00:06:27.861 --> 00:06:30.680
<v Speaker 1>that the country would be affected by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the national crisis,</v>

112
00:06:30.681 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 1>so in order to prevent it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up with an idea.</v>

113
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.783
<v Speaker 1>The economic system had to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformed and they had two beds on </v>

114
00:06:37.491 --> 00:06:38.324
<v Speaker 1>domestic demands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When it comes through in the mouth of a </v>

115
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:44.870
<v Speaker 1>politician that's domestic demands thing</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost always means they are planning to</v>

116
00:06:44.871 --> 00:06:48.810
<v Speaker 1>start overspending and swelling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what Beijing did.</v>

117
00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:51.943
<v Speaker 3>The Chinese government started a </v>
<v Speaker 3>colossal program of extra public </v>

118
00:06:54.371 --> 00:06:55.204
<v Speaker 3>spending of 4 trillion UN.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About $600,000,000,000 meant to be used </v>

119
00:06:58.421 --> 00:07:00.100
<v Speaker 3>for building all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 3>infrastructure,</v>

120
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:02.380
<v Speaker 3>high speed trains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>underground trains,</v>

121
00:07:02.381 --> 00:07:03.400
<v Speaker 3>highways,</v>
<v Speaker 3>houses,</v>

122
00:07:03.401 --> 00:07:04.450
<v Speaker 3>offices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cetera,</v>

123
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:05.690
<v Speaker 3>box.</v>

124
00:07:05.690 --> 00:07:06.523
<v Speaker 1>They went further than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese government's thoughts and </v>

125
00:07:09.031 --> 00:07:11.060
<v Speaker 1>that government overspending wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>

126
00:07:11.061 --> 00:07:13.850
<v Speaker 1>So they had to encourage the companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do the same.</v>

127
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.800
<v Speaker 1>So the question was how could they do </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

128
00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:16.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to use a traditional </v>

129
00:07:18.141 --> 00:07:18.974
<v Speaker 1>remedy,</v>

130
00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:21.163
<v Speaker 3>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trying to also started one of the most </v>

131
00:07:22.391 --> 00:07:23.224
<v Speaker 3>expansive monetary policies ever known.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The authorities lowered interest rates </v>

132
00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:29.590
<v Speaker 3>and banks gave money loans to everyone </v>
<v Speaker 3>who asks for them.</v>

133
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.350
<v Speaker 3>They practically establish an open bar </v>
<v Speaker 3>of cheap lumps.</v>

134
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.263
<v Speaker 1>In three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The price of housing was an average of </v>

135
00:07:36.561 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>two point four times more expensive to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an apartments which costs $100,000.</v>

136
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:45.170
<v Speaker 1>Three years before would now be worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>$240,000.</v>

137
00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>What was the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

138
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.120
<v Speaker 1>companies started to make all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>

139
00:07:50.121 --> 00:07:54.080
<v Speaker 1>They build ghost towns bought our </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies all over the world and engaged</v>

140
00:07:54.081 --> 00:07:56.330
<v Speaker 1>in all kinds of projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are gone.</v>

141
00:07:56.331 --> 00:07:57.164
<v Speaker 1>Whatever crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risky projects they felt like after all </v>

142
00:07:59.241 --> 00:08:01.460
<v Speaker 1>this central bank was pretty much giving</v>
<v Speaker 1>money away.</v>

143
00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:06.810
<v Speaker 3>Reduction in key industries is damaging </v>
<v Speaker 3>both China's economic sustainability and</v>

144
00:08:06.811 --> 00:08:08.220
<v Speaker 3>foreign trade relations.</v>

145
00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Obviously many of these projects have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never been profitable,</v>

146
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:14.290
<v Speaker 1>so the companies can't give the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

147
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.240
<v Speaker 1>So what did they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:08:16.241 --> 00:08:20.790
<v Speaker 1>they simply asked for new loans to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>back the old ones and the snowboard kept</v>

149
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.633
<v Speaker 1>rolling and it's getting bigger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger and this is how the Chinese </v>

150
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 1>economy became addicted to debt and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>I've probably got an idea of what you're</v>

151
00:08:29.351 --> 00:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stupid private companies,</v>

152
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:32.710
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

153
00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:33.603
<v Speaker 1>not exactly.</v>

154
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:39.240
<v Speaker 3>More than half of the bank debt in China</v>
<v Speaker 3>consists of loans from state owned banks</v>

155
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:40.770
<v Speaker 3>to state owned enterprises.</v>

156
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Wait just a second because there is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more</v>

157
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:50.700
<v Speaker 3>Chinese banks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a weapon of mass.</v>

158
00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:52.920
<v Speaker 2>We've</v>

159
00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>already seen how China is currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>going,</v>

160
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.230
<v Speaker 1>a debt overdose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as if this wasn't enough,</v>

161
00:08:58.231 --> 00:09:03.200
<v Speaker 1>there is another danger hiding in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>bushes back in the shadows.</v>

162
00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:08.130
<v Speaker 1>Banks face certain limitations on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of money they can loan,</v>

163
00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.993
<v Speaker 1>but Chinese banks have managed to skip </v>
<v Speaker 1>these controls and in a way these banks </v>

164
00:09:12.421 --> 00:09:14.960
<v Speaker 1>have just copied what American banks </v>
<v Speaker 1>were doing with them.</v>

165
00:09:14.961 --> 00:09:16.610
<v Speaker 1>Mortgages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>

166
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:18.923
<v Speaker 1>Instead of just giving loans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they set up off balance companies that </v>

167
00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:24.210
<v Speaker 1>issued the debt that the banks then </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought,</v>

168
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:25.133
<v Speaker 1>and these surprise surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the banks accounts are </v>

169
00:09:27.241 --> 00:09:31.110
<v Speaker 1>not listed as loans that are rather as </v>
<v Speaker 1>other investments.</v>

170
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:33.690
<v Speaker 1>It's actually a pretty smart workaround,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

171
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated.</v>

172
00:09:34.801 --> 00:09:35.634
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese banks have hidden woven </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000,000,000 and it has a </v>

173
00:09:39.481 --> 00:09:40.314
<v Speaker 1>straightforward consequence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese banks can be way less solvent </v>

174
00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:44.483
<v Speaker 1>than their official numbers might </v>
<v Speaker 1>indicate and besides much of this debt </v>

175
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.293
<v Speaker 1>is opaque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the actual Chinese desk could be </v>

176
00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:52.200
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much higher.</v>

177
00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.793
<v Speaker 1>The vast spread of off balance </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities and bank investment actually </v>

178
00:09:56.161 --> 00:09:59.760
<v Speaker 1>means a risk of hidden loans which could</v>
<v Speaker 1>threaten China's financial security,</v>

179
00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:02.310
<v Speaker 1>shrunk fully in ex president of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trainers,</v>

180
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:03.144
<v Speaker 1>banking regulatory commission and </v>
<v Speaker 1>weights because there's more a growing </v>

181
00:10:08.341 --> 00:10:09.174
<v Speaker 1>number of non bank financial firms also </v>
<v Speaker 1>market their own wealth management </v>

182
00:10:12.001 --> 00:10:12.834
<v Speaker 1>products and invest the money with </v>
<v Speaker 1>little disclosure of where the money </v>

183
00:10:15.301 --> 00:10:18.030
<v Speaker 1>goes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right in the last few years.</v>

184
00:10:18.031 --> 00:10:18.864
<v Speaker 1>Those companies at which get money from </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to make investments that are </v>

185
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:25.760
<v Speaker 1>risky and as opaque as become more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more popular as well.</v>

186
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 1>Why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:10:26.941 --> 00:10:27.774
<v Speaker 1>it's obviously because they're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get higher rates of return with those </v>

188
00:10:30.571 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that this craving for loans</v>

189
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.343
<v Speaker 1>has caused quite a bit of indigestion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a risk that the government is </v>

190
00:10:37.261 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 1>admitted and it has tried to limit </v>
<v Speaker 1>company loans,</v>

191
00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>but since there are a lot of unsold </v>
<v Speaker 1>ghost towns,</v>

192
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:46.320
<v Speaker 1>empty houses and bankruptcy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate agencies,</v>

193
00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.183
<v Speaker 1>the government has told the banks in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last few years to give away loans as if </v>

194
00:10:50.521 --> 00:10:52.410
<v Speaker 1>there was no tomorrow because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

195
00:10:52.411 --> 00:10:53.244
<v Speaker 1>the family debt level is still so low </v>
<v Speaker 1>that economists note that China's </v>

196
00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:58.613
<v Speaker 1>mortgage loans increased by 35 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 and now you might be beginning </v>

197
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:07.860
<v Speaker 1>to see why some analysts a warning that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't stop this debt vortex,</v>

198
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:08.723
<v Speaker 1>China could become a new Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country that has been in crisis since </v>

199
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:12.850
<v Speaker 1>the 1980.</v>

200
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.353
<v Speaker 1>There is still more because now we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>why she jinping and China need </v>

201
00:11:17.431 --> 00:11:18.264
<v Speaker 1>globalization quite so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air companies need foreign markets to </v>

202
00:11:21.331 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>deal with all of the debt that they have</v>
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>

203
00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:26.733
<v Speaker 1>Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything is all doom and gloom in </v>

204
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:29.444
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.680
<v Speaker 1>it's still to come in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The savings rates are still high,</v>

206
00:11:32.710 --> 00:11:33.543
<v Speaker 1>high enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the foreign capital to arrive in the </v>

207
00:11:35.051 --> 00:11:35.884
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

208
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:41.460
<v Speaker 1>That's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a risk and Moody's has given the</v>

209
00:11:41.461 --> 00:11:43.950
<v Speaker 1>first warning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's the time that the government to</v>

210
00:11:43.951 --> 00:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>start working to make reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now,</v>

211
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:48.000
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

214
00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.850
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that stagnation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll turn it into a new Japan or do you</v>

215
00:11:57.851 --> 00:12:01.480
<v Speaker 1>think there'll be new reforms which will</v>
<v Speaker 1>open China even more to the West?</v>
