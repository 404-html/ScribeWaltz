<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.003
<v Speaker 2>let me start with question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where do you think there is more </v>

3
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:10.854
<v Speaker 2>inequality?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is it in silicon valley or isn't in </v>

4
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:14.520
<v Speaker 2>Burundi?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

5
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 2>The answer of course is silicon valley.</v>

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.850
<v Speaker 2>This is not actually necessarily bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>news.</v>

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.713
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you work as a systems </v>

8
00:00:25.981 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 2>engineer at the Cisco officers in San </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jose.</v>

9
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.910
<v Speaker 2>You can make around $7,500 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not Bad.</v>

10
00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:33.780
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

11
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:34.673
<v Speaker 2>if you could go that with your friends </v>
<v Speaker 2>who works as a software engineer at </v>

12
00:00:36.781 --> 00:00:39.840
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to feel like a beg APP.</v>

13
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Somebody in that position can easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>make more than $11,000 a month.</v>

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.533
<v Speaker 2>And of course all of that is pretty much</v>
<v Speaker 2>pennies if you compare it to the </v>

15
00:00:48.211 --> 00:00:49.044
<v Speaker 2>earnings of your neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elon Musk and mark Zuckerberg or any of </v>

16
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 2>the other tycoons sniffing in the area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

17
00:00:54.901 --> 00:00:55.734
<v Speaker 2>anybody would feel poor living amongst </v>
<v Speaker 2>the people with the world's largest </v>

18
00:00:59.041 --> 00:01:01.350
<v Speaker 2>fortunes and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can guess we were thinking,</v>

19
00:01:01.351 --> 00:01:02.184
<v Speaker 2>I mean it surely it's not so bad to live</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a city where people are making </v>

20
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:06.840
<v Speaker 2>$150,000 a year on average.</v>

21
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.863
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so I can probably guess where you're </v>

22
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:14.740
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably thinking,</v>

23
00:01:14.741 --> 00:01:15.574
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>living in the city web poor people make </v>

24
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 2>$150,000 a year is going to be a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>good place to live,</v>

25
00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.090
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

26
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.640
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as we say,</v>

27
00:01:24.641 --> 00:01:25.474
<v Speaker 2>things aren't always as good as they see</v>
<v Speaker 2>in an area with so much concentrated </v>

28
00:01:29.411 --> 00:01:30.244
<v Speaker 2>wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

29
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.880
<v Speaker 2>what do you think happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

30
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.010
<v Speaker 2>Prices go absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sky High.</v>

31
00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.053
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you think you'd have to pay </v>

32
00:01:38.201 --> 00:01:41.140
<v Speaker 2>to rent a two bedroom apartment in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountain view?</v>

33
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Speaker 2>Mountain view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

34
00:01:42.281 --> 00:01:45.040
<v Speaker 2>is where Google has his headquarters and</v>
<v Speaker 2>do note here.</v>

35
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:48.940
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about a big metropolis</v>
<v Speaker 2>like New York City or London.</v>

36
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:49.803
<v Speaker 2>This town's population would fit </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortably in the middle of somewhere </v>

37
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:53.404
<v Speaker 2>like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh yeah.</v>

38
00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.890
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

39
00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:58.753
<v Speaker 2>so that being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how much do you think you should pay </v>

40
00:01:59.811 --> 00:02:01.610
<v Speaker 2>$500 a month,</v>
<v Speaker 2>$1,000 a month,</v>

41
00:02:01.611 --> 00:02:04.860
<v Speaker 2>$2,000 a month?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well after several google searches,</v>

42
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.880
<v Speaker 2>the cheapest rent we could find was </v>
<v Speaker 2>$3,400 the cheapest in general houses in</v>

43
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:15.110
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley are 60% more expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>than elsewhere in America.</v>

44
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.063
<v Speaker 2>And I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know with a salary of $11,000 a month </v>

45
00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:22.280
<v Speaker 2>for your more than happy to pay $3,500 a</v>
<v Speaker 2>month in rent.</v>

46
00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.900
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

47
00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.390
<v Speaker 2>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But let's just think for a moment.</v>

48
00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:27.410
<v Speaker 2>We've got to think about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

49
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:31.550
<v Speaker 2>what Silicon Valley really famous for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's famous for entrepreneurs.</v>

50
00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 2>The main appeal of Silicon Valley is not</v>
<v Speaker 2>working for facebook.</v>

51
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.720
<v Speaker 2>It's for starting your own facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now think about it.</v>

52
00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:41.720
<v Speaker 2>What do you really want to start a </v>
<v Speaker 2>company in such an expensive place?</v>

53
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.810
<v Speaker 2>Maybe knots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which explains this.</v>

54
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>The tech</v>

55
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.720
<v Speaker 2>elite are abandoning silicon valley in </v>
<v Speaker 2>droves because of group think and out of</v>

56
00:02:52.721 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Living costs.</v>

57
00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have that right.</v>

58
00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:56.493
<v Speaker 2>In the year 2017 silicon valley had </v>
<v Speaker 2>negative net for the first time in </v>

59
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:01.893
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means there were more people </v>

60
00:03:03.551 --> 00:03:04.384
<v Speaker 2>leaving than coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is surprising if we take into </v>

61
00:03:06.761 --> 00:03:07.594
<v Speaker 2>account that this area of the world was </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing like crazy since the year 1950 </v>

62
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.600
<v Speaker 2>take mountain view.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

63
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>in 1950 this town was no bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 2>6,000 inhabitants.</v>

64
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.051
<v Speaker 2>Now it has more than 81,000 and the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>map and with the rest of the area.</v>

65
00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to a survey,</v>

66
00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.114
<v Speaker 2>half of the residents are seriously </v>
<v Speaker 2>considering leaving because of the high </v>

67
00:03:28.571 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 2>cost of living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of them have already left and among</v>

68
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 2>them is the man you see here.</v>

69
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.573
<v Speaker 2>Teal leaves Silicon Valley for Los </v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles and guys you've never heard of </v>

70
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:42.144
<v Speaker 2>him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He gtl is something like Silicon </v>

71
00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:45.870
<v Speaker 2>Valley's Santa Claus along with Elon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Musk.</v>

72
00:03:45.871 --> 00:03:48.480
<v Speaker 2>He's one of the founders of paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>

73
00:03:48.481 --> 00:03:49.314
<v Speaker 2>he became a venture capitalist and we'd </v>
<v Speaker 2>say he's basically facebook's godfather </v>

74
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:54.173
<v Speaker 2>please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve was the one who put serious money </v>

75
00:03:54.931 --> 00:03:57.480
<v Speaker 2>into this company when it was taking its</v>
<v Speaker 2>first baby steps,</v>

76
00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:02.550
<v Speaker 2>but the question now is why are there so</v>
<v Speaker 2>many people leaving Silicon Valley?</v>

77
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 2>Is the cost of living really the only </v>
<v Speaker 2>reason or are there others?</v>

78
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:07.643
<v Speaker 2>And most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is this the end of Silicon Valley as we </v>

79
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.184
<v Speaker 2>know it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well today we're going to answer all of </v>

80
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 2>those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>

81
00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the history </v>
<v Speaker 2>country for entrepreneurs.</v>

82
00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.060
<v Speaker 2>Now in another visual politic video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we told you how a silicon valley startup</v>

83
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.073
<v Speaker 2>gets financed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the so called startup </v>

84
00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:35.080
<v Speaker 2>financing cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course silicon valley is the best</v>

85
00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 2>place on earth to find people ready to </v>
<v Speaker 2>bat on your idea as another bonus.</v>

86
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:43.060
<v Speaker 2>This place is the Disneyland of skilled </v>
<v Speaker 2>workforces.</v>

87
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 2>If you want to start a company that </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufactures self driving cars,</v>

88
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 2>you need people who've mastered the </v>
<v Speaker 2>latest technology</v>

89
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.203
<v Speaker 1>drinks.</v>

90
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.850
<v Speaker 2>And the reality is you ain't gonna find </v>
<v Speaker 2>them in the middle of Wyoming.</v>

91
00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Speaker 2>The most talented people they gather in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley and they're ready to hire</v>

92
00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:03.870
<v Speaker 2>or get hired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So well,</v>

93
00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:04.860
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

94
00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:05.723
<v Speaker 2>these tons of people you would like to </v>
<v Speaker 2>hire for your brand new startup and now </v>

95
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:11.190
<v Speaker 2>do busy earning $150,000 a year at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Google.</v>

96
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 2>And yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your idea,</v>

97
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:15.000
<v Speaker 2>it might be disruptive and it might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>innovative,</v>

98
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:15.834
<v Speaker 2>but yet can't compete with the salaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and especially the stability that a </v>

99
00:05:19.741 --> 00:05:21.890
<v Speaker 2>giant like a Google can provide,</v>

100
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.750
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snap</v>

101
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 2>a startup in a garage with the garage </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs millions of dollars.</v>

102
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.530
<v Speaker 2>Odd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jay Ryan from Mithril capital talking to</v>

103
00:05:32.531 --> 00:05:34.990
<v Speaker 2>the economist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this isn't the end of the story.</v>

104
00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:35.853
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>California has the highest taxes in the </v>

105
00:05:37.571 --> 00:05:41.590
<v Speaker 2>entire United States and things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They don't just stop that.</v>

106
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:42.483
<v Speaker 2>You see in America,</v>
<v Speaker 2>states have plenty of autonomy to raise </v>

107
00:05:44.681 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 2>or lower taxes and can even decide how </v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to collect those taxes.</v>

108
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.060
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state of taxes,</v>

109
00:05:50.061 --> 00:05:50.894
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have an income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the taxes they collect the </v>

110
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:53.674
<v Speaker 2>through in direct taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's all the taxes that you pay on </v>

111
00:05:56.831 --> 00:05:59.090
<v Speaker 2>top of the things you buy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>California,</v>

112
00:05:59.150 --> 00:05:59.983
<v Speaker 2>they're the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're very little value added tax and </v>

113
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 2>most of the collection comes from </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers' salaries and especially capital</v>

114
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:06.944
<v Speaker 2>gains.</v>

115
00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:10.853
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you're an investor and you're making </v>

116
00:06:11.911 --> 00:06:12.744
<v Speaker 2>a loss of money this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had better get your wallet ready </v>

117
00:06:14.751 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>because California is going to charge </v>
<v Speaker 2>you more than anywhere else and this,</v>

118
00:06:18.921 --> 00:06:19.754
<v Speaker 2>this is not exactly great news when you </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider that silicon valley is what it </v>

119
00:06:22.401 --> 00:06:25.130
<v Speaker 2>is because of venture capitalists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

120
00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:27.800
<v Speaker 2>this is not the only reason why people </v>
<v Speaker 2>are leaving the valley.</v>

121
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.753
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Teal hasn't left because of state </v>

122
00:06:30.201 --> 00:06:31.034
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>otherwise he wouldn't have gone to Los </v>

123
00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 2>Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is in California.</v>

124
00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:37.640
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that a lot of people like </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe that Silicon Valley has lost all</v>

125
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.940
<v Speaker 2>of the diversity that it used to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous.</v>

126
00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.963
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

127
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.843
<v Speaker 3>Peter Teal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Silicon Valley has become a one party </v>

128
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:47.640
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

129
00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.310
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Teal supported Donald Trump during</v>

130
00:06:50.311 --> 00:06:51.144
<v Speaker 2>the campaign and apparently this kind of</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing is not very well regarded in the </v>

131
00:06:53.941 --> 00:06:56.880
<v Speaker 2>valley where liberal thinking as King </v>
<v Speaker 2>Allen's well,</v>

132
00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:57.773
<v Speaker 2>truth be told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many reasons why silicon </v>

133
00:06:59.941 --> 00:07:03.690
<v Speaker 2>valley people are not big fans of Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump and well,</v>

134
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:05.010
<v Speaker 2>that's explore those reasons.</v>

135
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:05.933
<v Speaker 1>Speed</v>

136
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.460
<v Speaker 3>One b</v>

137
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 2>June.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I told you that the greatest amount</v>

138
00:07:11.171 --> 00:07:13.990
<v Speaker 2>of talent on the planet is located in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Silicon Valley.</v>

139
00:07:13.991 --> 00:07:15.370
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I didn't misspeak.</v>

140
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:16.263
<v Speaker 2>I did mean planet and not just America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that 57% of the people </v>

141
00:07:19.931 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 2>working for the tech companies in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley come from other countries.</v>

142
00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is an industry with more immigrants</v>

143
00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.283
<v Speaker 2>on the locals and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how do these immigrants get into </v>

144
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:30.484
<v Speaker 2>America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

145
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.700
<v Speaker 2>that's easy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They use the famous h one b visa.</v>

146
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.893
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is a visa that allows you to stay </v>

147
00:07:36.911 --> 00:07:39.550
<v Speaker 3>on US territory for between three and </v>
<v Speaker 3>six.</v>

148
00:07:40.650 --> 00:07:41.483
<v Speaker 1>Cheers,</v>

149
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:44.623
<v Speaker 3>get it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must be hired by a company that can </v>

150
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:47.744
<v Speaker 3>prove that your skills are both </v>
<v Speaker 3>necessary to its operations and that </v>

151
00:07:50.871 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 3>those skills cannot be provided by </v>
<v Speaker 3>domestic work</v>

152
00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.463
<v Speaker 1>groups</v>

153
00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:58.640
<v Speaker 3>fired.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have one month to find another job.</v>

154
00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 3>You can't find another job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You must leave America.</v>

155
00:08:02.290 --> 00:08:03.123
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this visa is requested by the employer </v>

156
00:08:05.261 --> 00:08:07.090
<v Speaker 2>and the government can deny it if they </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to.</v>

157
00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:10.330
<v Speaker 2>And most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these visas are limited.</v>

158
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.170
<v Speaker 2>They can issue a maximum of 65,000 in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entire country.</v>

159
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:15.850
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A good share of them.</v>

160
00:08:15.851 --> 00:08:16.684
<v Speaker 2>Go to those workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emigrating to silicon valley for a </v>

161
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:20.120
<v Speaker 2>better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin,</v>

162
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:20.973
<v Speaker 2>the year 2016 google and apple hides </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 5,000 people through this </v>

163
00:08:24.971 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 2>process and of course you can probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>work out what I'm going to say next.</v>

164
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:31.090
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump ain't exactly a fan of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>h one b</v>

165
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:39.460
<v Speaker 3>trump's hire American order.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It makes it harder to get h one b visas.</v>

166
00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:40.500
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't know about you,</v>

167
00:08:40.501 --> 00:08:42.060
<v Speaker 2>but backwards.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump took office.</v>

168
00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:45.990
<v Speaker 2>We made a video where we explained all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the powers that the president has,</v>

169
00:08:46.110 --> 00:08:46.943
<v Speaker 2>these other things that he can do </v>
<v Speaker 2>without having to get a vote in </v>

170
00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 2>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Border control is one of them and if you</v>

171
00:08:51.541 --> 00:08:52.374
<v Speaker 2>saw that video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is actually one of the first we </v>

172
00:08:53.281 --> 00:08:54.114
<v Speaker 2>ever made on this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will remember Obama was just as </v>

173
00:08:56.551 --> 00:09:01.551
<v Speaker 2>restrictive on immigration as Donald </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump us.</v>

174
00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.780
<v Speaker 2>The devil here is very much in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details and one of the details is this h</v>

175
00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:09.614
<v Speaker 2>one b visa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's in fact a very small detail that </v>

176
00:09:11.841 --> 00:09:13.790
<v Speaker 2>makes a big problem in silicon.</v>

177
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:18.240
<v Speaker 1>Holly Silicon Valley's</v>

178
00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.720
<v Speaker 3>stalls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hiring a foreign tech workers,</v>

179
00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:25.930
<v Speaker 3>employer requests to interview </v>
<v Speaker 3>candidates fall 37% on trump immigration</v>

180
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:27.134
<v Speaker 3>fears</v>

181
00:09:27.140 --> 00:09:27.973
<v Speaker 2>according to some media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of these tech companies might open </v>

182
00:09:29.961 --> 00:09:33.620
<v Speaker 2>new offices in countries like Canada </v>
<v Speaker 2>where it's easier to hire immigrants,</v>

183
00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:37.160
<v Speaker 2>but so far we don't have any data as to </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether this is actually happening or if</v>

184
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:38.990
<v Speaker 2>it's ever really going to happen on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>

185
00:09:38.991 --> 00:09:42.770
<v Speaker 2>the question we can already start </v>
<v Speaker 2>answering is this were good.</v>

186
00:09:42.771 --> 00:09:45.920
<v Speaker 2>The next tech capital of the welds be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

187
00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:51.250
<v Speaker 2>we're going to tell you right now from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Palo Alto to shenzen,</v>

188
00:09:52.730 --> 00:09:53.563
<v Speaker 2>if you google it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll discover that almost every city </v>

189
00:09:55.521 --> 00:09:56.354
<v Speaker 2>wants to become the new silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just need to find a journalist who </v>

190
00:09:58.641 --> 00:09:59.474
<v Speaker 2>finds a couple of computer programmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>working together and you've already got </v>

191
00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:04.760
<v Speaker 2>an article titled the Silicon Valley of</v>

192
00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:07.300
<v Speaker 3>Insert name of your city or region.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

193
00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:08.333
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are lots of wishful articles that </v>

194
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.214
<v Speaker 2>quoted Berlin as a startup creation hub.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the German government is open to </v>

195
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 2>offices in silicon valley so that German</v>
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs can find investors.</v>

196
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.613
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is that almost no company </v>
<v Speaker 2>has managed to seduce those big venture </v>

197
00:10:22.591 --> 00:10:25.170
<v Speaker 2>capital funds in California at least.</v>

198
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.113
<v Speaker 2>So the big question now is how do we </v>
<v Speaker 2>know if a city is really becoming a </v>

199
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:33.950
<v Speaker 2>technological capital?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

200
00:10:33.951 --> 00:10:34.784
<v Speaker 2>one way of measuring this would be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of Unicorns that have been born </v>

201
00:10:37.701 --> 00:10:39.380
<v Speaker 2>yet and say now might be asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

202
00:10:39.381 --> 00:10:41.030
<v Speaker 2>what's a unicorn beside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

203
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:42.500
<v Speaker 2>the mythical beast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

204
00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:47.450
<v Speaker 2>a Unicorn is a startup that ends up with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a valuation of over $1 billion.</v>

205
00:10:47.570 --> 00:10:52.490
<v Speaker 2>In 2017 57 startups became unicorns and </v>
<v Speaker 2>from those 57 startups,</v>

206
00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:54.890
<v Speaker 2>18 we're not American.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

207
00:10:55.070 --> 00:10:57.470
<v Speaker 2>China was their country of origin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

208
00:10:57.550 --> 00:10:59.900
<v Speaker 2>he was.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about companies like Dji,</v>

209
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:02.150
<v Speaker 2>which manufacturers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>drones and Alibaba,</v>

210
00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:04.940
<v Speaker 2>which we talked about here on visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic previously,</v>

211
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.390
<v Speaker 2>and it explains headlines like this one</v>

212
00:11:12.890 --> 00:11:14.460
<v Speaker 3>in this latest growth market.</v>

213
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venture capital,</v>

214
00:11:16.020 --> 00:11:17.370
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sequoia capital.</v>

215
00:11:17.371 --> 00:11:19.640
<v Speaker 2>There's a vc fund to born in Silicon </v>
<v Speaker 2>Valley.</v>

216
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.573
<v Speaker 2>They have already opened several offices</v>
<v Speaker 2>in China and I know what you're </v>

217
00:11:22.951 --> 00:11:23.784
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this really mean that China is </v>

218
00:11:25.351 --> 00:11:27.450
<v Speaker 2>going to mouth shine America?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

219
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.343
<v Speaker 2>the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other cities like Mumbai in India and </v>

220
00:11:31.111 --> 00:11:34.950
<v Speaker 2>Tel Aviv in Israel have also attracted a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of money from VC funds.</v>

221
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:39.850
<v Speaker 3>You might've heard of a company called a</v>
<v Speaker 3>wix.</v>

222
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:42.970
<v Speaker 3>This is a company that allows you to </v>
<v Speaker 3>create websites very easily.</v>

223
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.650
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're from Israel,</v>

224
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:47.760
<v Speaker 1>knew the</v>

225
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.350
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>has no Unicorns,</v>

226
00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:50.393
<v Speaker 3>is real,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does have more than 2% of all of the </v>

227
00:11:52.261 --> 00:11:55.900
<v Speaker 3>worlds of capital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That might not seem like a lot of money,</v>

228
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:56.763
<v Speaker 3>but it is if we take into account the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fact that Israel has a smaller </v>

229
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 3>population than New York</v>

230
00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:01.973
<v Speaker 1>Si.</v>

231
00:12:03.210 --> 00:12:05.880
<v Speaker 2>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is no clear alternative to silicon</v>

232
00:12:05.881 --> 00:12:06.714
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even now with the accidents we talked </v>

233
00:12:08.011 --> 00:12:10.500
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>silicon valley still gets more than half</v>

234
00:12:10.530 --> 00:12:11.363
<v Speaker 2>of the money that's invested into </v>
<v Speaker 2>startups and chances are they're going </v>

235
00:12:14.161 --> 00:12:17.910
<v Speaker 2>to continue to hold that sway over this </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry for a long time.</v>

236
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:19.530
<v Speaker 2>So what's the difference then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

237
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:22.530
<v Speaker 2>now there aren't many other places where</v>
<v Speaker 2>good ideas can prospect.</v>

238
00:12:22.590 --> 00:12:24.000
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago,</v>

239
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.130
<v Speaker 2>if you had a good idea and you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 2>see it grow,</v>

240
00:12:26.131 --> 00:12:29.880
<v Speaker 2>there was virtually one place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you've got many more in,</v>

241
00:12:29.881 --> 00:12:31.760
<v Speaker 2>well this is always good news.</v>

242
00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:35.563

<v Speaker 2>do you think silicon valley has reached </v>

243
00:12:37.971 --> 00:12:38.804
<v Speaker 2>its peak in terms of growth or do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe this accidents will stop soon </v>

244
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.940
<v Speaker 2>and that the valley will start growing </v>
