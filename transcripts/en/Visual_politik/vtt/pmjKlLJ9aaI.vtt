1
00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:05.700
<v Speaker 1>And the reason is the exposure of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Panama papers in the paradise papers,</v>

2
00:00:05.701 --> 00:00:06.534
<v Speaker 1>if once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but tax havens on the public opinion </v>

3
00:00:08.881 --> 00:00:13.881
<v Speaker 1>radar in the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>criticism of these places has multiplied</v>

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.660
<v Speaker 1>all throughout the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

5
00:00:15.661 --> 00:00:16.890
<v Speaker 1>businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer players,</v>

6
00:00:16.891 --> 00:00:19.810
<v Speaker 1>singers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or simply investors and savers.</v>

7
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.753
<v Speaker 1>Many people transfer part of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunes to these places supposedly to </v>

8
00:00:24.031 --> 00:00:24.864
<v Speaker 1>pay fewer taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why many critics states that if </v>

9
00:00:26.971 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>it weren't for these millionaire </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>the 2008 financial crisis would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been less of a crisis.</v>

11
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.513
<v Speaker 1>We're told that without these paradises,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments wouldn't have to make so </v>

12
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:42.840
<v Speaker 1>many cuts with all pay fewer taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and ultimately it would make things much</v>

13
00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.501
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:45.750
<v Speaker 1>the question now is how true is all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

15
00:00:45.751 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>All tax havens rarely so bad for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general welfare of the population?</v>

16
00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's check it out.</v>

17
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:04.400
<v Speaker 1>The first thing we need to be clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>about is what a tax haven is.</v>

18
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.750
<v Speaker 1>A tax haven is nothing more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>jurisdiction with low taxes,</v>

19
00:01:14.751 --> 00:01:15.584
<v Speaker 1>high legal security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an extreme amounts of protection of </v>

20
00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:18.974
<v Speaker 1>the savers privacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is very important because cutting </v>

21
00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:24.590
<v Speaker 1>taxes isn't enough to turn a territory </v>
<v Speaker 1>into a tax haven,</v>

22
00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:25.720
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

23
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:26.593
<v Speaker 1>the international investors and savers </v>
<v Speaker 1>who use these jurisdictions really want </v>

24
00:01:29.721 --> 00:01:30.554
<v Speaker 1>to protect their assets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why they not only demands low </v>

25
00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:33.914
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also legal security that is in </v>

26
00:01:36.291 --> 00:01:37.124
<v Speaker 1>addition to low taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to ensure that their assets </v>

27
00:01:38.931 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>are safe from any kinds of robbery,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalization confiscation,</v>

28
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:43.730
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation,</v>

29
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.080
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

30
00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.580
<v Speaker 1>what's common to all tax havens even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than low taxes isn't legal safety.</v>

31
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.820
<v Speaker 1>They're all the cayman islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>

32
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:53.780
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong,</v>

33
00:01:53.781 --> 00:01:54.920
<v Speaker 1>cypress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jersey,</v>

34
00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:55.880
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bermuda.</v>

35
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.780
<v Speaker 1>All of these jurisdictions that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>recognize as important financial centers</v>

36
00:01:59.781 --> 00:02:02.920
<v Speaker 1>in that characterized by their high </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal safety say this,</v>

37
00:02:02.921 --> 00:02:05.870
<v Speaker 1>essentially know that the government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not going to take all of their money.</v>

38
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.270
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely this combination of low </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes and high legal security that makes</v>

39
00:02:11.271 --> 00:02:12.104
<v Speaker 1>these territories receive so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital from around the world and to </v>

40
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.553
<v Speaker 1>grow at rates and much higher than in </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries and though operating in </v>

41
00:02:18.861 --> 00:02:19.694
<v Speaker 1>these places isn't illegal in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite what the media might suggest </v>

42
00:02:23.031 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>appearing in the paradise papers are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Panama papers.</v>

43
00:02:25.291 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't necessarily mean that you've </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed a crime.</v>

44
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.753
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the names on these lists of </v>

45
00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:32.720
<v Speaker 1>those entirely innocent people,</v>

46
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>people like alex krivaline,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shakira,</v>

47
00:02:37.401 --> 00:02:38.234
<v Speaker 1>whose assets have a legal origin and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use tax havens to minimize their tax </v>

48
00:02:41.511 --> 00:02:45.890
<v Speaker 1>bills within the bounds of the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may seem more or less immoral,</v>

49
00:02:45.891 --> 00:02:46.724
<v Speaker 1>but it's perfectly legal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another very important detail which we </v>

50
00:02:53.231 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 1>usually forget is that these tax havens </v>
<v Speaker 1>are a refuge for millions of citizens.</v>

51
00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>You have the misfortune of being in </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian and extractive country.</v>

52
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:05.613
<v Speaker 1>we all know that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world where the most </v>

53
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.254
<v Speaker 1>basic human rights on guarantees or wow </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governments arbitrarily </v>

54
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>decide who to repress or persecuted that</v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

55
00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Many investors don't seek protection </v>
<v Speaker 1>just for lower taxes.</v>

56
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 1>They also escaping political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological,</v>

57
00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.480
<v Speaker 1>and religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think for example,</v>

58
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.680
<v Speaker 1>of political dissidence in Russia or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela or families who are threatened</v>

59
00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:30.603
<v Speaker 1>by kidnapping in Mexico or entrepreneurs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that come from countries with few </v>

60
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 1>guarantees like Zimbabwe or better </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce,</v>

61
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.993
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all benefit from being able to </v>

62
00:03:38.321 --> 00:03:41.320
<v Speaker 1>access jurisdictions that guarantee the </v>
<v Speaker 1>safety,</v>

63
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.480
<v Speaker 1>that tax havens</v>

64
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.330
<v Speaker 1>because it's also a matter of justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then we do explain it,</v>

65
00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.203
<v Speaker 1>most people think it's an aberration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when some states present messages and </v>

66
00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:53.950
<v Speaker 1>it's from leaving the country as happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the berlin wall,</v>

67
00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:54.803
<v Speaker 1>what we should also probably think it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>an aberration when states preventing </v>

68
00:03:56.741 --> 00:03:57.574
<v Speaker 1>their citizens from taking their savings</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of the country and depositing it in </v>

69
00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.310
<v Speaker 1>a more protective foreign jurisdiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is of course,</v>

70
00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.530
<v Speaker 1>if they're doing it in compliance with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the law.</v>

71
00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.423
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that both the media and </v>

72
00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:09.244
<v Speaker 1>politicians greatly exaggerate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Consequences that these tax havens half </v>

73
00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.230
<v Speaker 1>on our economies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's check it out.</v>

74
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.330
<v Speaker 1>A very exaggerated</v>

75
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.223
<v Speaker 2>roll.</v>

76
00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.793
<v Speaker 1>Too many polIticians and journalists tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>havens are greatly responsible for all </v>

77
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:31.994
<v Speaker 1>of the ells we suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the third world governments </v>

78
00:04:34.101 --> 00:04:35.560
<v Speaker 1>budget cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inequality,</v>

79
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.240
<v Speaker 1>and under development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ThiS is what the organization,</v>

80
00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.880
<v Speaker 1>oxfam argues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

81
00:04:39.881 --> 00:04:43.850
<v Speaker 1>I check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The current global inequality crisis has</v>

82
00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:44.684
<v Speaker 1>a clear ally in tax havens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These jurisdictions represent the black </v>

83
00:04:48.231 --> 00:04:50.180
<v Speaker 1>hole through the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>

84
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.023
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of people around the world </v>

85
00:04:52.221 --> 00:04:53.001
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:53.001 --> 00:04:53.834
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must state that oxfam is definition </v>

87
00:04:55.371 --> 00:04:57.860
<v Speaker 1>of a tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Haven is a bit lax in their opinion.</v>

88
00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:00.380
<v Speaker 1>A tax haven is any country that has very</v>
<v Speaker 1>low taxes,</v>

89
00:05:00.381 --> 00:05:01.214
<v Speaker 1>especially for foreign investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This definition includes countries like </v>

90
00:05:03.711 --> 00:05:04.544
<v Speaker 1>the Netherlands and Luxembourg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course they received such a </v>

91
00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 1>qualification from the european </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission,</v>

92
00:05:08.811 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>the european parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the oec deep,</v>

93
00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with this definition,</v>

94
00:05:13.101 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>let's see how important those tax havens</v>
<v Speaker 1>really off.</v>

95
00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:25.470
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take the case of Spain,</v>

96
00:05:25.471 --> 00:05:26.304
<v Speaker 1>a european union country with a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>average income that has many economic </v>

97
00:05:29.461 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 1>problems as well as high taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

98
00:05:31.441 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>based on their government's own data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain invested 40 point nine,</v>

99
00:05:34.771 --> 00:05:35.604
<v Speaker 1>$1,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion euros overseas in 2016 of this </v>

100
00:05:37.981 --> 00:05:39.210
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nine point five,</v>

101
00:05:39.211 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 1>4 billion ended up in what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oxfam mccall's tax havens.</v>

102
00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:43.613
<v Speaker 1>Nine point five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$4 million is less than five percent of </v>

103
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.223
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish people invested in the entire </v>

104
00:05:48.001 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including Spain during that year.</v>

105
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.323
<v Speaker 1>So really the reality is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relevance of these tax savings isn't </v>

106
00:05:53.641 --> 00:05:56.340
<v Speaker 1>quite as great as it's made out to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

107
00:05:56.341 --> 00:05:57.174
<v Speaker 1>the highest place the world heritage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tax havens at about seven point </v>

108
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>$6,000,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might seem like a huge number,</v>

109
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:05.900
<v Speaker 1>but when you look at it from a global </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

110
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we might not like it,</v>

111
00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:09.493
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that tax havens can </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardly be responsible for the big </v>

112
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>problems that many critics say they are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's not all here.</v>

113
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:16.273
<v Speaker 1>Let's return to Spain situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 seven percent of the spanish </v>

114
00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:22.514
<v Speaker 1>investments that went to oxfam's tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>havens in 2016 were concentrated in </v>

115
00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.580
<v Speaker 1>Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Netherlands and Luxembourg.</v>

116
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:31.760
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a bit over </v>
<v Speaker 1>$8,000,000</v>

117
00:06:31.761 --> 00:06:32.330
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:33.163
<v Speaker 1>in that same year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these three countries invested over </v>

119
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>$12,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>into Spain.</v>

120
00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax havens not only do two d capitalize,</v>

121
00:06:40.221 --> 00:06:43.640
<v Speaker 1>the business fabric of a country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>fiscally uncompetitive as Spain.</v>

122
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:45.020
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the opposite.</v>

123
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:48.320
<v Speaker 1>These tax havens of helped capitalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>the week spanish economy.</v>

124
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg is the country that invest </v>
<v Speaker 3>the most in Spain,</v>

125
00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 3>in factorieS,</v>
<v Speaker 3>buildings,</v>

126
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.300
<v Speaker 3>farms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>employment,</v>

127
00:06:57.330 --> 00:06:58.163
<v Speaker 3>but it isn't public,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but private money most comes from </v>

128
00:07:00.421 --> 00:07:03.870
<v Speaker 3>companies and savings vehicles </v>
<v Speaker 3>established in the country.</v>

129
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.970
<v Speaker 3>Javier,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gee,</v>

130
00:07:04.971 --> 00:07:07.920
<v Speaker 3>your in economics journalist in it'll </v>
<v Speaker 3>competency are.</v>

131
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 3>But Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's look at another key question.</v>

132
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.170
<v Speaker 3>How much revenue did governments lose</v>

133
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>result of tax havens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it true that without them there would</v>

134
00:07:16.971 --> 00:07:19.070
<v Speaker 1>have been no cuts during the crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:07:19.071 --> 00:07:19.904
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>

136
00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:28.510
<v Speaker 3>Story of the milKmaid.</v>

137
00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.233
<v Speaker 1>We've seen one of the most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>criticisms tax havens yet is that if we </v>

138
00:07:34.121 --> 00:07:34.954
<v Speaker 1>hadn't had such unfair competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments wouldn't have had to make </v>

139
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:41.170
<v Speaker 1>budget cuts as a result of the 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis.</v>

140
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:42.610
<v Speaker 1>But is it true?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:07:42.611 --> 00:07:44.000
<v Speaker 1>let's get baCk to our spanish case </v>
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

142
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.113
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the countries that </v>

143
00:07:47.291 --> 00:07:49.480
<v Speaker 1>suffered the most from the recession.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:07:49.481 --> 00:07:51.670
<v Speaker 1>according to data from the spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>ministry of economy,</v>

145
00:07:51.671 --> 00:07:52.504
<v Speaker 1>the investment accumulated in oxfam </v>
<v Speaker 1>defined tax savings year after year </v>

146
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:59.230
<v Speaker 1>announced an $80 million dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

147
00:07:59.231 --> 00:08:01.420
<v Speaker 1>if all of that money had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated in Spain,</v>

148
00:08:01.421 --> 00:08:02.254
<v Speaker 1>instead of tax havens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the extra income that the spanish state </v>

149
00:08:04.211 --> 00:08:07.750
<v Speaker 1>would have received would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately one to one point 5 billion</v>

150
00:08:07.751 --> 00:08:08.740
<v Speaker 1>euros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

151
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:09.593
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like quite a bit of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I promise you it's a really </v>

152
00:08:11.170 --> 00:08:13.120
<v Speaker 1>minuscule amount in the overall scheme </v>
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

153
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:14.043
<v Speaker 4>thanks.</v>

154
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:19.810
<v Speaker 1>Give you an idea about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about zero point one percent of the</v>

155
00:08:19.811 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 1>spanish gdp and less than point five </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of all taxes collected.</v>

156
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.473
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a very limited impact and if </v>

157
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.253
<v Speaker 1>instead of Spain we took a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in the rest of the </v>

158
00:08:33.971 --> 00:08:36.370
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation is pretty similar.</v>

159
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if we take the highest estimates of</v>

160
00:08:38.801 --> 00:08:39.634
<v Speaker 1>the tax Justice network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the source that's usually used </v>

161
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:43.690
<v Speaker 1>to denounce tax havens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll see.</v>

162
00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:46.900
<v Speaker 1>They show a global collection loss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>about $200,000,000,000,</v>

163
00:08:46.901 --> 00:08:50.500
<v Speaker 1>which is Barely one percent of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tax revenues of the world's governments.</v>

164
00:08:50.530 --> 00:08:51.363
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that contrary to what's </v>

165
00:08:52.420 --> 00:08:55.200
<v Speaker 1>usually claimed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tax havens aren't to be blamed for the</v>

166
00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.034
<v Speaker 1>cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nor do they force us to pay more taxes </v>

167
00:08:57.751 --> 00:09:00.420
<v Speaker 1>or really harm our economies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We mAy not like it much,</v>

168
00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:01.313
<v Speaker 1>but it's just the thing.</v>

169
00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

170
00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:09.480
<v Speaker 1>In 1980 islands was actually poor than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain today.</v>

171
00:09:09.481 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to these policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the second richest country in the</v>

172
00:09:12.121 --> 00:09:14.220
<v Speaker 1>eurozone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To improve the general welfare,</v>

173
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 1>we need more companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not more politicians and not more public</v>

174
00:09:17.491 --> 00:09:18.324
<v Speaker 1>spending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problems that countries with </v>

175
00:09:19.081 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 1>economic difficulties face don't usually</v>
<v Speaker 1>come from tax havens,</v>

176
00:09:22.381 --> 00:09:24.300
<v Speaker 1>ms from the politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now is your time.</v>

177
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that tax havens should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>persecuted?</v>
