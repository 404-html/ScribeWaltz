1
00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:02.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.443
<v Speaker 2>Politic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have talked about how we now live in </v>

3
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:18.274
<v Speaker 2>a world where every day there is less </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty and people are able to live </v>

4
00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:22.210
<v Speaker 2>better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lives are changed.</v>

5
00:00:22.211 --> 00:00:25.180
<v Speaker 2>That is even reaching the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>unprotected region in the world.</v>

6
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:26.230
<v Speaker 2>Sub Saharan Africa.</v>

7
00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.093
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.150
<v Speaker 2>We talked about the African lions and </v>
<v Speaker 2>paid special attention,</v>

9
00:00:32.151 --> 00:00:34.070
<v Speaker 2>so in cases like Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

10
00:00:34.071 --> 00:00:37.460
<v Speaker 2>we still need to talk about when and why</v>
<v Speaker 2>this region of the world,</v>

11
00:00:37.461 --> 00:00:40.700
<v Speaker 2>which so many considered hopelessly </v>
<v Speaker 2>destitute began to change.</v>

12
00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:41.743
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

13
00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.083
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is precisely what we are going to </v>

14
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.360
<v Speaker 2>talk about in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's ams.</v>

15
00:00:49.361 --> 00:00:51.220
<v Speaker 2>What we can expect in the upcoming </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Four years talking about Africa has </v>
<v Speaker 2>men's talking about extreme poverty,</v>

17
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.103
<v Speaker 2>natural disasters and all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflicts and in a way things are still </v>

18
00:01:07.681 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

19
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.611
<v Speaker 2>see?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

20
00:01:08.611 --> 00:01:10.590
<v Speaker 2>More or less than half.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.543
<v Speaker 2>Half of all the people who suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme poverty in the world live in </v>

22
00:01:14.881 --> 00:01:15.714
<v Speaker 2>these sub Saharan African region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about 400 million people </v>

23
00:01:19.561 --> 00:01:22.170
<v Speaker 2>have also like this isn't surprising </v>
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.910
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:29.170
<v Speaker 1>Facing the largest humanitarian crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the creation of the United Nations</v>

26
00:01:29.171 --> 00:01:30.004
<v Speaker 1>in 1945 now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 20 million people across four </v>

27
00:01:33.101 --> 00:01:36.670
<v Speaker 1>countries face starvation and famine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stephen O'Brien,</v>

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 1>the UN under secretary general for </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian affairs.</v>

29
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.333
<v Speaker 2>Do you do all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure nobody has the stranger to </v>

30
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:43.584
<v Speaker 2>those Ngo campaigns seeking to raise </v>
<v Speaker 2>funds for all kinds of humanitarian </v>

31
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:47.334
<v Speaker 2>catastrophes in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're probably also familiar with </v>

32
00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:49.584
<v Speaker 2>governments allocating billions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars each year to official </v>

33
00:01:51.691 --> 00:01:53.170
<v Speaker 2>development assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

34
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.170
<v Speaker 2>government aid is as high as it's ever </v>
<v Speaker 2>been.</v>

35
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 2>Every year the African guns and receives</v>
<v Speaker 2>about $50 billion and this,</v>

36
00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.510
<v Speaker 2>it's been going on for them</v>

37
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.343
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

38
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.840
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that for years,</v>

39
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:09.640
<v Speaker 2>all of this money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't help very much.</v>

40
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's take a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

41
00:02:11.171 --> 00:02:12.004
<v Speaker 2>the 1919</v>

42
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.853
<v Speaker 4>yes</v>

43
00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.320
<v Speaker 2>Wallington national aid in this area of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world amounts to tens of billions.</v>

44
00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:29.350
<v Speaker 2>What do you think happens with poverty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it decreased?</v>

45
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

46
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 2>None of that happen.</v>

47
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.893
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

48
00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.560
<v Speaker 2>1990 and 1998 it's poverty levels went </v>
<v Speaker 2>from 55% to 58</v>

49
00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:40.483
<v Speaker 4>is that,</v>

50
00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.680
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could this be?</v>

51
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.573
<v Speaker 2>You might ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well because intentions are one thing </v>

52
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.220
<v Speaker 2>but reality is ready difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some experts claim that's it.</v>

53
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>official aid weakens local print</v>

54
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 4>juices.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Evidence</v>

55
00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>overwhelmingly demonstrates that aid to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa has made the poor</v>

56
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 2>poorer and growth slower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dambisa Moyo an economist and the author</v>

57
00:03:04.511 --> 00:03:05.344
<v Speaker 2>of dead aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why aid is not working and how there is </v>

58
00:03:07.481 --> 00:03:09.430
<v Speaker 2>a better way for Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

59
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:10.264
<v Speaker 2>in Tanzania it was cheaper to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidized the milk from the European </v>

60
00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Union oven from local producers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

61
00:03:15.011 --> 00:03:18.970
<v Speaker 2>with the beginning of a new century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>suddenly everything began to change</v>

62
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.560
<v Speaker 3>for great change.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Suddenly</v>

63
00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.800
<v Speaker 2>only when Africa seemed helpless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything began to change.</v>

64
00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:38.700
<v Speaker 2>With the beginning of the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>statistics absolutely turns around.</v>

65
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:39.563
<v Speaker 2>Since the year 2000 and extreme poverty </v>
<v Speaker 2>has dropped by almost 40% average life </v>

66
00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:45.090
<v Speaker 2>expectancy has grown by more than 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

67
00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.953
<v Speaker 2>Infant mortality has decreased to less </v>
<v Speaker 2>than half the same as happens with HIV </v>

68
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:52.140
<v Speaker 2>infections in children as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Virtually any other</v>

69
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.250
<v Speaker 3>statistic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we look good,</v>

70
00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:58.693
<v Speaker 2>the economy will be able to see how </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 2000 and 2015 sub Saharan </v>

71
00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.060
<v Speaker 2>African countries excluding South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>

72
00:04:05.061 --> 00:04:05.894
<v Speaker 2>which has a bit of a peculiar case as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen on visual politic previously </v>

73
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.750
<v Speaker 2>grew by an average of 6% which is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than twice,</v>

74
00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.250
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin America.</v>

75
00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.340
<v Speaker 2>Another great indicator of how things </v>
<v Speaker 2>are changing is tourism.</v>

76
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.733
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

77
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:21.331
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tourism.</v>

78
00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:22.164
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tourism sector has some particular </v>

79
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:26.550
<v Speaker 2>characteristics that reveal a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information.</v>

80
00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:27.413
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this sector has great transformational </v>

81
00:04:29.551 --> 00:04:30.384
<v Speaker 2>power for the poorest because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>labor intensive and on the other hand </v>

82
00:04:33.521 --> 00:04:34.354
<v Speaker 2>can we need to take into account so that</v>
<v Speaker 2>people don't vacation in countries that </v>

83
00:04:36.781 --> 00:04:39.570
<v Speaker 2>are at war or a famine or have </v>
<v Speaker 2>epidemics.</v>

84
00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:40.404
<v Speaker 2>It's just not a nice holiday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When this industry improves in the </v>

85
00:04:43.081 --> 00:04:43.914
<v Speaker 2>poorest countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is usually a good indicator that </v>

86
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 2>things are improving as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What if we see the data?</v>

87
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.564
<v Speaker 2>We might be quite surprised because this</v>
<v Speaker 2>sector has been growing as an average </v>

88
00:04:54.241 --> 00:04:57.780
<v Speaker 2>annual rate of no less than 9% for 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

89
00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:00.720
<v Speaker 2>That is two full decades of nearly </v>
<v Speaker 2>double digit growth.</v>

90
00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:01.583
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does seem as if things are really </v>

91
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:04.253
<v Speaker 2>moving forward,</v>

92
00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:05.343
<v Speaker 3>which</v>

93
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:13.830
<v Speaker 2>bought at this point in the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering something because</v>

94
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.723
<v Speaker 2>I certainly am.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What on earth happens to cause such a </v>

95
00:05:18.301 --> 00:05:19.010
<v Speaker 2>change?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

96
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.010
<v Speaker 2>have a look at this graph because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>really gives a clue what,</v>

97
00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.840
<v Speaker 2>what exactly led to this miracle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

98
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:28.733
<v Speaker 2>that's have a look at that.</v>

99
00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:34.333
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

100
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Airing for takeoff</v>

101
00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:38.730
<v Speaker 3>things</v>

102
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:41.370
<v Speaker 2>drive change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we will now see how three particular</v>

103
00:05:41.371 --> 00:05:44.370
<v Speaker 2>events in Africa began to change </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably permanently.</v>

104
00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:47.730
<v Speaker 2>This continence reality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first one it was remittances.</v>

105
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.730
<v Speaker 2>See in Africa the population grows very </v>
<v Speaker 2>quickly,</v>

106
00:05:50.731 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 2>which along with the terrible living </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions has led.</v>

107
00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.210
<v Speaker 2>Many Africans do immigrates to rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the past few decades.</v>

108
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.723
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people send tens of billions of </v>

109
00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.243
<v Speaker 2>dollars home every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This money is used in local markets or </v>

110
00:06:03.441 --> 00:06:04.274
<v Speaker 2>to set up businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are what we call remittances ans </v>

111
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:07.514
<v Speaker 2>they are actually much more important </v>
<v Speaker 2>than developmental eight seconds and </v>

112
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:12.344
<v Speaker 2>very importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in March of 2000 the u s Congress </v>

113
00:06:14.091 --> 00:06:14.924
<v Speaker 2>finally approved a law that had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted by Bill Clinton in his last </v>

114
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.913
<v Speaker 2>years in office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's called the African Growth and </v>

115
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 2>Opportunity Act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is basically a law that establishes</v>

116
00:06:23.391 --> 00:06:24.224
<v Speaker 2>a preferential trade agreements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>eliminates terrorists and reduces </v>

117
00:06:26.841 --> 00:06:27.674
<v Speaker 2>barriers to trade for thousands and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of products from sub Saharan </v>

118
00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.440
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

119
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:35.293
<v Speaker 2>since this agreement was approved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see that between 2000 and 2016 </v>

120
00:06:38.361 --> 00:06:40.160
<v Speaker 2>which went exactly the most prosperous </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

121
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:44.690
<v Speaker 2>have a trade between the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>in sub Saharan Africa multiplied two and</v>

122
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:45.524
<v Speaker 2>a half times,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means a 6% growth every year and </v>

123
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 2>third and perhaps the key to everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's China.</v>

124
00:06:54.590 --> 00:06:54.951
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

125
00:06:54.951 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 2>Have the rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2001 China,</v>

126
00:06:56.781 --> 00:06:57.614
<v Speaker 2>it joins the World Trade Organization as</v>
<v Speaker 2>became something of a factory to the </v>

127
00:07:01.101 --> 00:07:01.851
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

128
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.980
<v Speaker 2>what has happened since then has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite impressive.</v>

129
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.120
<v Speaker 2>China's huge grief has lifted tens of </v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of people out of poverty,</v>

130
00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:10.040
<v Speaker 2>both in China and in Africa.</v>

131
00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.190
<v Speaker 5>Government of China and that was when in</v>
<v Speaker 5>the honest thing,</v>

132
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 5>Ethiopia's industrialization and on </v>
<v Speaker 5>supporting the yes,</v>

133
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:23.810
<v Speaker 5>great vision to become Africa's </v>
<v Speaker 5>manufacturing.</v>

134
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:24.993
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

135
00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:30.373
<v Speaker 2>to explain myself yet the Asian giants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gigantic grief has increased this </v>

136
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 2>country's demands for all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>products,</v>

137
00:07:35.420 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 2>raw materials,</v>
<v Speaker 2>food,</v>

138
00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

139
00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many African countries took advantage of</v>

140
00:07:41.481 --> 00:07:42.314
<v Speaker 2>this opportunity since the year 2000 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade between China and Africa has </v>

141
00:07:45.351 --> 00:07:46.184
<v Speaker 2>multiplied by no less than the 17 times </v>
<v Speaker 2>representing an annual growth rate of </v>

142
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:54.851
<v Speaker 2>almost 20% since 2009 China is already </v>
<v Speaker 2>by far the continent's largest trading.</v>

143
00:07:55.351 --> 00:07:55.450
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

144
00:07:55.450 --> 00:07:56.283
<v Speaker 4>Partner.</v>

145
00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.950
<v Speaker 2>There's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese,</v>

146
00:07:59.951 --> 00:08:00.784
<v Speaker 2>as we mentioned here have also been </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing a lot of money all over the </v>

147
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:06.650
<v Speaker 2>world and Africa is certainly no </v>
<v Speaker 2>exception.</v>

148
00:08:06.651 --> 00:08:07.484
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2016 four out of every 10 euros that </v>

149
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:15.200
<v Speaker 2>Farhan is invested in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa came from China.</v>

150
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:16.063
<v Speaker 2>Today more than 10,000 Chinese companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>are doing business on the African </v>

151
00:08:18.501 --> 00:08:21.470
<v Speaker 2>continent is can I sleep?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Private companies that work in all kinds</v>

152
00:08:21.471 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 2>of industries and that number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it just keeps running.</v>

153
00:08:27.950 --> 00:08:28.850
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>My friends.</v>

154
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:29.713
<v Speaker 2>This is how Africa has managed to start </v>
<v Speaker 2>turning the statistics around the </v>

155
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:34.370
<v Speaker 2>greatest catalyst for this entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>change.</v>

156
00:08:34.371 --> 00:08:35.204
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't some kind of miracle and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have much to do with </v>

157
00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:38.253
<v Speaker 2>developmental aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This change was driven by trade and </v>

158
00:08:41.061 --> 00:08:41.894
<v Speaker 2>investments and Africans themselves seem</v>
<v Speaker 2>to see it very clearly and if you don't </v>

159
00:08:44.931 --> 00:08:46.640
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll take a look at this.</v>

160
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:48.313
<v Speaker 2>African countries are forging ahead to </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete negotiations for continental </v>

161
00:08:52.191 --> 00:08:56.520
<v Speaker 2>free trade area between 55 countries by </v>
<v Speaker 2>early next year.</v>

162
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.443
<v Speaker 2>The idea adopted by the African Union in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2012 is to create a single market which </v>

163
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:04.830
<v Speaker 2>includes the free movement of goods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>services and people.</v>

164
00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>

165
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 2>Africa is working to expand the trade to</v>
<v Speaker 2>every corner of the continents.</v>

166
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:11.610
<v Speaker 2>Not all countries are developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>equally,</v>

167
00:09:11.700 --> 00:09:12.533
<v Speaker 2>but this is quite normal and then all </v>
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world following the Asian </v>

168
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:20.754
<v Speaker 2>Star</v>

169
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.830
<v Speaker 2>points,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to ask ourselves the question,</v>

170
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:28.070
<v Speaker 2>can we really dream of Africa's final </v>
<v Speaker 2>takeoff?</v>

171
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:28.933
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I suspect that many of you are probably </v>

172
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:30.554
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well everything you say in visual </v>

173
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:32.624
<v Speaker 2>politic is very nice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't usually what really </v>

174
00:09:35.181 --> 00:09:35.961
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

175
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:36.651
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Africa,</v>

176
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:37.484
<v Speaker 2>it's absolutely true that all countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are doing well and there are </v>

177
00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:41.420
<v Speaker 2>countries that are not doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you know what?</v>

178
00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:43.700
<v Speaker 2>That's true,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's also really normal.</v>

179
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:45.230
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it may sound shocking today,</v>

180
00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:48.620
<v Speaker 2>but in the 1950s Asia was this poor as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>

181
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.510
<v Speaker 2>I mean today we can look at cities like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Shanghai,</v>

182
00:09:50.511 --> 00:09:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Taipei.</v>

183
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.130
<v Speaker 2>It makes it really hard to imagine that </v>
<v Speaker 2>these places will.</v>

184
00:09:54.131 --> 00:09:54.964
<v Speaker 2>One is pork.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The when South Korea or Taiwan began to </v>

185
00:09:56.961 --> 00:09:57.794
<v Speaker 2>grow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't richer than Ghana or </v>

186
00:09:59.001 --> 00:10:00.890
<v Speaker 2>Senegal for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and China,</v>

187
00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:02.750
<v Speaker 2>India and Vietnam era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

188
00:10:02.751 --> 00:10:03.620
<v Speaker 2>way poorer.</v>

189
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:06.493
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

190
00:10:11.330 --> 00:10:12.163
<v Speaker 2>can absolutely draw some really </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting ideas from this because </v>

191
00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:17.900
<v Speaker 2>Asian countries didn't grow all at once </v>
<v Speaker 2>and they didn't grow all together.</v>

192
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.010
<v Speaker 2>While Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore,</v>

193
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:20.540
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Taiwan grew.</v>

194
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:22.660
<v Speaker 2>Other countries such as China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indonesia,</v>

195
00:10:22.661 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 2>and India remains in mass</v>

196
00:10:24.340 --> 00:10:25.173
<v Speaker 3>poverty.</v>

197
00:10:26.770 --> 00:10:27.603
<v Speaker 2>They weren't exactly democratic models.</v>
<v Speaker 2>South Korea and Taiwan were under hard </v>

198
00:10:30.551 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 2>dictatorships until very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore is in a similar state.</v>

199
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:35.351
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

200
00:10:35.351 --> 00:10:40.330
<v Speaker 2>what can I say in shorts and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>

201
00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.220
<v Speaker 2>some more advanced countries with </v>
<v Speaker 2>others.</v>

202
00:10:42.221 --> 00:10:44.110
<v Speaker 2>Further behind is plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorships.</v>

203
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.973
<v Speaker 2>Essentially what we're seeing in Africa </v>
<v Speaker 2>today wasn't so different from what was </v>

204
00:10:47.561 --> 00:10:49.300
<v Speaker 2>happening in Asia just 50 years ago.</v>

205
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:55.310
<v Speaker 3>Ready</v>

206
00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:59.340
<v Speaker 2>for takeoff?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

207
00:10:59.370 --> 00:11:03.240
<v Speaker 2>Things in Africa are changing after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 countries that are apparently growing</v>

208
00:11:03.241 --> 00:11:06.540
<v Speaker 2>the most in 2017 five are in Africa.</v>

209
00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:10.990
<v Speaker 3>If we</v>

210
00:11:10.990 --> 00:11:13.180
<v Speaker 2>take a look at the latest to doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>business reports,</v>

211
00:11:13.181 --> 00:11:16.630
<v Speaker 2>the wells bank indicator for measuring </v>
<v Speaker 2>how easy it is to do business in certain</v>

212
00:11:16.631 --> 00:11:19.210
<v Speaker 2>economies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can see the towns of the 10 countries</v>

213
00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:21.790
<v Speaker 2>that have improved the most for are also</v>
<v Speaker 2>African.</v>

214
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:24.423
<v Speaker 2>True poverty here is still very high and</v>
<v Speaker 2>these countries are facing a difficult </v>

215
00:11:27.431 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Speaker 2>challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

216
00:11:28.361 --> 00:11:29.194
<v Speaker 2>the large population growth on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continent is actually going to multiply </v>

217
00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:33.250
<v Speaker 2>in the upcoming decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

218
00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:35.680
<v Speaker 2>the good news is that everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>indicates,</v>

219
00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Speaker 2>but thanks to trade and international </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments.</v>

220
00:11:38.200 --> 00:11:42.730
<v Speaker 2>Africa is finding its way and it's maybe</v>
<v Speaker 2>once and for all is ready for takeoff,</v>

221
00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:45.430
<v Speaker 2>but I would see what town do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Africa will emulate,</v>

222
00:11:45.431 --> 00:11:48.220
<v Speaker 2>the developments that Asia has had in </v>
<v Speaker 2>recent decades?</v>

223
00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:49.083
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
