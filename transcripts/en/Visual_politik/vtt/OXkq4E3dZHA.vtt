1
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.143
<v Speaker 2>that was stated by the famous Harvard </v>
<v Speaker 2>University economics professor Edward </v>

3
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.360
<v Speaker 2>Glaeser cities czar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of humanity's great creations.</v>

4
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.240
<v Speaker 2>Cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They make us retro greener,</v>

5
00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:19.800
<v Speaker 2>healthier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>happier.</v>

6
00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:21.070
<v Speaker 2>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>over time,</v>

7
00:00:21.071 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 2>cities have become a synonym for freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and prosperity.</v>

8
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.463
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are in precisely a new phenomenon </v>

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 2>since human beings stopped wandering </v>
<v Speaker 2>from place to place in search of food.</v>

10
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.740
<v Speaker 2>About 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>years ago,</v>

11
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:32.603
<v Speaker 2>they began to build settlements that </v>
<v Speaker 2>over time became cities and it was </v>

12
00:00:35.521 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 2>finally in the third millennium BC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great city states began to emerge in</v>

13
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:41.850
<v Speaker 2>the Mesopotamian region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>City is like,</v>

14
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.240
<v Speaker 2>oh my gosh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Umar and it's the most popular one.</v>

15
00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.400
<v Speaker 2>Babylon today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>5,000</v>

16
00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than half of the world's population</v>

17
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:54.320
<v Speaker 2>lives in cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and by the way,</v>

18
00:00:54.321 --> 00:00:57.630
<v Speaker 2>more than 500 of those cities have more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than 1 million inhabitant.</v>

19
00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:01.143
<v Speaker 2>There's no doubt about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Great Take off of urbanism happens </v>

20
00:01:03.611 --> 00:01:06.400
<v Speaker 2>in the 19th century with the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

21
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.263
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've lived in a state of constant </v>

22
00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:09.423
<v Speaker 2>urbanization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a process that has so far in deodorants </v>

23
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:13.390
<v Speaker 2>switch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While it doesn't look like it's going to</v>

24
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.040
<v Speaker 2>stop anytime soon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

25
00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.933
<v Speaker 2>the United Nations predict that by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year 2050 almost 70% of the entire </v>

26
00:01:20.591 --> 00:01:21.424
<v Speaker 2>world's population will live in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What began in what we now know is </v>

27
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.204
<v Speaker 2>developed countries and since the mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th century extended to developing </v>

28
00:01:28.151 --> 00:01:32.240
<v Speaker 2>countries has led to a world dominated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by huge metropolises.</v>

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.281
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one second.</v>

30
00:01:39.281 --> 00:01:40.114
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is the influence of big </v>

31
00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.600
<v Speaker 2>cities?</v>
<v Speaker 2>She wants him revealing facts.</v>

32
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here they are.</v>

33
00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.390
<v Speaker 2>It's estimated that only the 600 most </v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamic cities in the world where 23% of</v>

34
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:50.224
<v Speaker 2>the planet's population lives generates </v>
<v Speaker 2>55% of all economic activity in a few </v>

35
00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.833
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That figures is going to exceed 60% in </v>

36
00:02:02.811 --> 00:02:03.644
<v Speaker 2>other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our wells and our way of life depends </v>

37
00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.314
<v Speaker 2>more and more on cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cities off of the World Watch Messi </v>

38
00:02:09.561 --> 00:02:12.200
<v Speaker 2>might be if a boss Ilona,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a new phenomenon,</v>

39
00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:15.680
<v Speaker 2>has emerged from this huge evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's mega cities.</v>

40
00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:19.700
<v Speaker 2>These are metropolises with more than 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>million inhabitants nowadays.</v>

41
00:02:19.701 --> 00:02:23.210
<v Speaker 2>There are no less than 43 of these on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planet and so check this out.</v>

42
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 2>They all the places that are growing the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most in developing countries,</v>

43
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.260
<v Speaker 2>and this presents a huge challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

44
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.123
<v Speaker 2>it causes so many problems that it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>setting off major alarm bells allow me </v>

45
00:02:38.431 --> 00:02:40.440
<v Speaker 2>to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the poorest countries in the world,</v>

46
00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:44.760
<v Speaker 2>cities are growing at a frantic and </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely uncontrolled pace,</v>

47
00:02:44.761 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 2>which is generating very high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution,</v>

48
00:02:47.071 --> 00:02:50.070
<v Speaker 2>crime as chaotic traffic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of the new mega cities,</v>

49
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 2>they've simply devolved into chaos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

50
00:02:52.291 --> 00:02:56.340
<v Speaker 2>check out these headlines from air </v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution closes all schools in Tehran.</v>

51
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.480
<v Speaker 2>New Delhi is once again the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>polluted city on earth.</v>

52
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might have several questions.</v>

53
00:03:03.641 --> 00:03:07.030
<v Speaker 2>Where will the most populated cities in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world be in a few decades?</v>

54
00:03:07.031 --> 00:03:09.820
<v Speaker 2>What would be their future?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And most importantly,</v>

55
00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>what challenges do these new mega cities</v>
<v Speaker 2>face?</v>

56
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:14.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see.</v>

57
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.010
<v Speaker 2>New Giants,</v>

58
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:26.443
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then unfortunately I have an assignment </v>

59
00:03:27.921 --> 00:03:28.754
<v Speaker 2>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're going to need to learn and </v>

60
00:03:29.901 --> 00:03:32.570
<v Speaker 2>remember some new city names because </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>

61
00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:35.720
<v Speaker 2>most of the new mega cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they arms even household names.</v>

62
00:03:35.721 --> 00:03:36.554
<v Speaker 2>Yet a recent study by the Ontario </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute of Technology as indicators </v>

63
00:03:39.231 --> 00:03:40.760
<v Speaker 2>for the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the end of this century,</v>

64
00:03:40.761 --> 00:03:43.850
<v Speaker 2>we can expect the largest cities not to </v>
<v Speaker 2>be places like Tokyo,</v>

65
00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:45.560
<v Speaker 2>Mexico City,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

66
00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.640
<v Speaker 2>but rather legos can Shasta and Dar es </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salaam.</v>

67
00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you heard that right?</v>

68
00:03:51.201 --> 00:03:54.260
<v Speaker 2>Future mega cities will be among other </v>
<v Speaker 2>places in Africa.</v>

69
00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:55.193
<v Speaker 2>Surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While you shouldn't be at least if you </v>

70
00:03:56.421 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>follow visual politic regularly on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel,</v>

71
00:03:58.531 --> 00:03:59.364
<v Speaker 2>and we've already mentioned several </v>
<v Speaker 2>times how the African continent is </v>

72
00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:02.443
<v Speaker 2>changing.</v>

73
00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:03.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

74
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 2>Did that study by the Institute of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Technology of Ontario,</v>

75
00:04:08.101 --> 00:04:11.490
<v Speaker 2>these three cities located in Nigeria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Congo in Tanzania,</v>

76
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:14.130
<v Speaker 2>which are expected to be the largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities in the world,</v>

77
00:04:14.131 --> 00:04:18.750
<v Speaker 2>could surpass the 75 million inhabitant </v>
<v Speaker 2>mark by the end of the century.</v>

78
00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.530
<v Speaker 2>75 million people is a truly enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>figure.</v>

79
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.020
<v Speaker 2>If this happens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just one of these cities would have more</v>

80
00:04:25.021 --> 00:04:27.270
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants than all of Germany today.</v>

81
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

82
00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.453
<v Speaker 2>crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>

83
00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:32.293
<v Speaker 2>but hold on a second because we really </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't need to go that far into the </v>

84
00:04:34.701 --> 00:04:37.250
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's estimated that by the year 2050 and</v>

85
00:04:37.251 --> 00:04:38.084
<v Speaker 2>that's really not that far away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the five largest metropolitan areas </v>

86
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:42.750
<v Speaker 2>on the planet will be these places,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check it out.</v>

87
00:04:42.751 --> 00:04:43.584
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.243
<v Speaker 1>Three</v>

89
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.273
<v Speaker 2>Lindsay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wanted Bangladesh ends another in the </v>

90
00:04:48.421 --> 00:04:49.254
<v Speaker 2>Congo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The largest of all of them will have </v>

91
00:04:50.401 --> 00:04:52.680
<v Speaker 2>more than 40 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

92
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:55.350
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this poses a great deal of challenges.</v>

93
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:56.213
<v Speaker 2>If today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these cities already have huge </v>

94
00:04:57.481 --> 00:04:58.314
<v Speaker 2>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine what it will be like in a few </v>

95
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.863
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's see exactly what we're dealing </v>

96
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:07.161
<v Speaker 2>with here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The challenges</v>

97
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.720
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the case of Legos,</v>

98
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:16.780
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria as larger city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually kind of amazing.</v>

99
00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.870
<v Speaker 2>In the 1960s this city barely had </v>
<v Speaker 2>180,000</v>

100
00:05:19.871 --> 00:05:20.704
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It looked like a small western style </v>

101
00:05:22.361 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>coastal town and it was surrounded by </v>
<v Speaker 2>small villages.</v>

102
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.983
<v Speaker 2>Today it's got more than 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants and it's simply when you </v>

103
00:05:29.471 --> 00:05:31.690
<v Speaker 2>stop growing according to an existing </v>
<v Speaker 2>estimates,</v>

104
00:05:31.691 --> 00:05:35.260
<v Speaker 2>this city is destined to become the most</v>
<v Speaker 2>populated place on the planet.</v>

105
00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.183
<v Speaker 2>By the end of the century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it could have more than 90 million </v>

106
00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:39.573
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there's an important point when we </v>

107
00:05:41.081 --> 00:05:41.914
<v Speaker 2>talk about mega cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's normal to think of huge </v>

108
00:05:43.181 --> 00:05:44.014
<v Speaker 2>skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>super imposed transport systems into </v>

109
00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.340
<v Speaker 2>gigantic avenues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

110
00:05:48.341 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>today in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality is very,</v>

111
00:05:50.321 --> 00:05:51.154
<v Speaker 2>very different.</v>

112
00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.173
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

113
00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 2>Z with more than 20 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sligo since become a collapsed labyrinth</v>

114
00:05:59.151 --> 00:06:02.660
<v Speaker 2>of cars and motorcycles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a place where power outages or frequence</v>

115
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 2>and public services such as water supply</v>
<v Speaker 2>and waste collection and treatments when</v>

116
00:06:06.681 --> 00:06:07.514
<v Speaker 2>they exist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fail more often than a silicon valley </v>

117
00:06:09.921 --> 00:06:10.754
<v Speaker 2>startup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course most of the population </v>

118
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 2>they live in crowded,</v>
<v Speaker 2>substandard housing and others in misery</v>

119
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:21.440
<v Speaker 2>because of course this excessive city </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth,</v>

120
00:06:21.441 --> 00:06:22.274
<v Speaker 2>it poses two kinds of problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One directly related to infrastructure </v>

121
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:26.324
<v Speaker 2>ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can the other with the social and </v>

122
00:06:27.291 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 2>political consequences that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>involve</v>

123
00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.570
<v Speaker 3>managing a city in excess of 50 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>inhabitants,</v>

124
00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.433
<v Speaker 3>is it daunting task,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially as many of these cities are </v>

125
00:06:36.871 --> 00:06:41.400
<v Speaker 3>woefully under serviced today?</v>
<v Speaker 3>65 years is a relatively short timeframe</v>

126
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:43.500
<v Speaker 3>with regard to urban infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Much of it,</v>

127
00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.453
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>London Underground and brome streets as </v>

128
00:06:46.531 --> 00:06:48.960
<v Speaker 3>long lived and can take decades to </v>
<v Speaker 3>develop.</v>

129
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:50.910
<v Speaker 3>Daniel Horn wag and Kevin Pope</v>

130
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:53.820
<v Speaker 2>see recently a United Nations study </v>
<v Speaker 2>about Manila,</v>

131
00:06:53.821 --> 00:06:57.240
<v Speaker 2>the capital city of the Philippines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and one of the fastest growing cities in</v>

132
00:06:57.241 --> 00:06:58.074
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Documents at a myriad of problems </v>

133
00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:02.280
<v Speaker 2>related to waste management's according </v>
<v Speaker 2>to this study,</v>

134
00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:03.153
<v Speaker 2>garbage piles up in the streets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>drainage problems and generating all </v>

135
00:07:05.761 --> 00:07:06.594
<v Speaker 2>kinds of infectious outbreaks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another study also from the United </v>

136
00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.070
<v Speaker 2>Nations warns that in Mumbai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second most popular city in India is</v>

137
00:07:13.071 --> 00:07:15.360
<v Speaker 2>one that exceeds the 20 million and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>habits and barrier,</v>

138
00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:16.243
<v Speaker 2>but substandard housing and shacks are </v>
<v Speaker 2>crowded on top of one another and the </v>

139
00:07:18.691 --> 00:07:20.670
<v Speaker 2>streets aren't even finished,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in many cases,</v>

140
00:07:20.671 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 2>they're not even paved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Making them flood in the monsoon season,</v>

141
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 2>which doesn't do any calls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>huge amounts of destruction,</v>

142
00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:28.890
<v Speaker 2>but the water ends up stagnating and </v>
<v Speaker 2>spreading diseases.</v>

143
00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:29.753
<v Speaker 2>Then there's the pollution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of these cities are among the most </v>

144
00:07:32.491 --> 00:07:36.360
<v Speaker 2>polluted in the world and we already saw</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a previous video just how much wealth</v>

145
00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:39.780
<v Speaker 2>and pollution are related and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems they don't end there.</v>

146
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:42.563
<v Speaker 2>This uncontrolled growth is also forcing</v>
<v Speaker 2>a large part of the population to live </v>

147
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:49.140
<v Speaker 2>in neighborhoods and areas where they </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't only lack of basic services,</v>

148
00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:52.110
<v Speaker 2>but also important institutions like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>police.</v>

149
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:52.973
<v Speaker 2>This is something that favors the spread</v>
<v Speaker 2>of Matthews and all kinds of criminal </v>

150
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.173
<v Speaker 2>and radical groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's precisely what mega cities like </v>

151
00:07:59.251 --> 00:08:00.084
<v Speaker 2>San Pablo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City are </v>

152
00:08:01.771 --> 00:08:02.604
<v Speaker 2>experiencing folks in sale now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The great metropolises of always been a </v>

153
00:08:07.381 --> 00:08:08.214
<v Speaker 2>source of wealth and prosperity that of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course there's no reason to think that </v>

154
00:08:11.371 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 2>it's going to be any different this time</v>
<v Speaker 2>around.</v>

155
00:08:13.311 --> 00:08:14.144
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

156
00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:18.600
<v Speaker 3>No country in the industrial era </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieved any significant economic growth</v>

157
00:08:18.601 --> 00:08:22.050
<v Speaker 3>without urbanization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Cities concentrate poverty,</v>

158
00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 3>but the also represent the main hope for</v>
<v Speaker 3>getting out of it.</v>

159
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Speaker 3>You end state of the world population </v>
<v Speaker 3>2007 right report.</v>

160
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:29.463
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cities have always been the center of </v>

161
00:08:30.491 --> 00:08:31.324
<v Speaker 2>knowledge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technological and artistic advances and </v>

162
00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:35.350
<v Speaker 2>new ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even at the political level,</v>

163
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:36.184
<v Speaker 2>people who live in cities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've traditionally had a more open </v>

164
00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:41.230
<v Speaker 2>vision and I've been more tolerance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>receptive to change.</v>

165
00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:42.093
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the emergence of these new mega </v>

166
00:08:43.031 --> 00:08:43.864
<v Speaker 2>cities in a world of cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks like we're facing a challenge </v>

167
00:08:45.851 --> 00:08:46.684
<v Speaker 2>with two possible outcomes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First that these new urban giants will </v>

168
00:08:49.691 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Speaker 2>bolster the local economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>generate new ways of creating wealth,</v>

169
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:53.854
<v Speaker 2>promote civil liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the end be seen as the equals of </v>

170
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:58.170
<v Speaker 2>cities like Tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

171
00:08:58.300 --> 00:08:59.133
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>

172
00:09:04.220 --> 00:09:05.053
<v Speaker 2>The second outcome is that these cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>will continue to grow in population </v>

173
00:09:07.581 --> 00:09:08.414
<v Speaker 2>without any substantial infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 2>improvements and that case the sum of </v>

174
00:09:11.691 --> 00:09:12.524
<v Speaker 2>misery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pollution and violence because ended up </v>

175
00:09:13.911 --> 00:09:14.744
<v Speaker 2>creating new radical politicians or </v>
<v Speaker 2>driving new refugee waves towards the </v>

176
00:09:18.190 --> 00:09:19.850
<v Speaker 2>more developed countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

177
00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:20.743
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you're not surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we on this channel like to think </v>

178
00:09:22.491 --> 00:09:23.324
<v Speaker 2>that it will be the first.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'd like to think that these new mega </v>

179
00:09:24.741 --> 00:09:25.574
<v Speaker 2>cities will contribute to a better world</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the near future as well as in the </v>

180
00:09:28.521 --> 00:09:29.354
<v Speaker 2>long term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for that they won't only need </v>

181
00:09:30.591 --> 00:09:31.424
<v Speaker 2>solidarity and to aid above all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're going to need a lot of </v>

182
00:09:34.281 --> 00:09:35.114
<v Speaker 2>investments anyways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>folks will be looking forward to all of </v>

183
00:09:37.161 --> 00:09:39.170
<v Speaker 2>these changes and I really hope you </v>
