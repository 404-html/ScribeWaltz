<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

2
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.983
<v Speaker 2>the Islamic Republic of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's that country that makes these </v>

3
00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:15.260
<v Speaker 2>independent movies you claim to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>bits of never actually watched.</v>

4
00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.153
<v Speaker 2>This country is also well known in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather different regard as being one of </v>

5
00:00:19.011 --> 00:00:23.120
<v Speaker 2>the United States isn't main enemies as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well as being something of an antagonist</v>

6
00:00:23.121 --> 00:00:26.120
<v Speaker 2>in Europe and in the democratic world in</v>
<v Speaker 2>general,</v>

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 2>Iran is an Islamic theocracy where the </v>
<v Speaker 2>head of state is not even a politician,</v>

8
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 2>but a religious leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Ayatollah Jones,</v>

9
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.860
<v Speaker 2>the legal system is based on sharia law </v>
<v Speaker 2>and torture and to executions are pretty</v>

10
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:42.940
<v Speaker 2>common in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:42.941 --> 00:00:45.600
<v Speaker 2>and just in case that wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government's also fun.</v>

12
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.670
<v Speaker 2>Several terrorist groups all over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

13
00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 2>Important bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This one called,</v>

14
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.720
<v Speaker 2>hold on just a second because I mean the</v>
<v Speaker 2>same is true of Saudi Arabia.</v>

15
00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudis,</v>

16
00:00:58.891 --> 00:00:59.724
<v Speaker 2>I'll run a major ally of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and to have important commercial </v>

17
00:01:02.731 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

18
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.720
<v Speaker 2>So why is it wrong and seen as bad?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:01:06.721 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia is seen as good by some </v>
<v Speaker 2>western governments.</v>

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Many would believe that the answer is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty simple one.</v>

21
00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:14.184
<v Speaker 2>Then that would be oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that Iran has the </v>

22
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.480
<v Speaker 2>fourth biggest oil reserves in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

23
00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.763
<v Speaker 2>the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their crude oil is similar to that in </v>

25
00:01:23.851 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

26
00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.033
<v Speaker 2>just one year ago they had a band,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning that they couldn't sell it to </v>

27
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:30.990
<v Speaker 2>most of the world's countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.853
<v Speaker 2>You heard that writes for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both America and Europe didn't want to </v>

29
00:01:33.781 --> 00:01:36.150
<v Speaker 2>buy anything that came from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

30
00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 2>so now you might be wondering why is it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong assumption threat to international</v>

31
00:01:40.111 --> 00:01:40.944
<v Speaker 2>security while other countries as </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical Islam or being better Teresa's </v>

32
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.560
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to answer that question,</v>

33
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:48.510
<v Speaker 2>but first let's take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

34
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.343
<v Speaker 1>Great</v>

35
00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:59.493
<v Speaker 2>thirst is lamach revolution until the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1970s it Roland was one of the most </v>

36
00:02:03.331 --> 00:02:04.164
<v Speaker 2>glamorous dictatorships in the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called sharp from Persia or </v>

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.070
<v Speaker 2>friends Mohammad Reza Pahlavi rules over</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country with an iron fist.</v>

38
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.250
<v Speaker 2>At the same time he and his wife are on </v>
<v Speaker 2>diva would go sit the magazine stars and</v>

39
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.900
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said our friend there because the shah</v>

40
00:02:20.901 --> 00:02:24.820
<v Speaker 2>of Persia was a great ally for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States as well as the free world.</v>

41
00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.793
<v Speaker 1>Generally,</v>

42
00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.383
<v Speaker 2>as we said a moment ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran holds the fourth largest oil </v>

43
00:02:31.151 --> 00:02:31.984
<v Speaker 2>reserves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus they have over 80 million </v>

44
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sandy,</v>

45
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 2>highly educated population when compared</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the neighboring countries.</v>

46
00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:39.603
<v Speaker 2>Further there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ron is a crucial spot for controlling </v>

47
00:02:41.381 --> 00:02:46.050
<v Speaker 2>the Middle East region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

48
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.983
<v Speaker 2>while the Shah was traveling all across </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world in drawing a lifestyle that </v>

49
00:02:49.441 --> 00:02:50.274
<v Speaker 2>would make Kanye West look humble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his country was getting ready for a </v>

50
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:55.690
<v Speaker 2>revolution and a surname.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I ones out.</v>

51
00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 2>What sorts of revolution like this be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it a communist revolution or perhaps</v>

52
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:01.390
<v Speaker 2>it was an Islamic one?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

53
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.120
<v Speaker 2>initially the Uranian opposition was </v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty varied.</v>

54
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.070
<v Speaker 2>Unlike Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're wrong,</v>

55
00:03:06.071 --> 00:03:09.790
<v Speaker 2>or as it was known before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Persian empire had a long history as</v>

56
00:03:09.791 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 2>well as a sophisticated</v>

57
00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:11.843
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

58
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.840
<v Speaker 2>So among these opposition groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you could find pre western liberals,</v>

59
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:19.760
<v Speaker 2>Marxists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Social Democrats,</v>

60
00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.260
<v Speaker 2>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>radical isn't.</v>

61
00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:22.094
<v Speaker 2>It assists the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just handle one indifference and bad to </v>

62
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:27.110
<v Speaker 2>the others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a leader,</v>

63
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.590
<v Speaker 2>the Ayatollah Khomeini displaying living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in exile in Paris.</v>

64
00:03:30.591 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 2>He had great charisma and a reputation </v>
<v Speaker 2>among via radio,</v>

65
00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:38.483
<v Speaker 2>poop is in Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kamini addressed all of these things </v>

66
00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:40.983
<v Speaker 2>ellucian raise in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraging them to take power with </v>

67
00:03:43.271 --> 00:03:46.030
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promise of a new and democratic Iran and</v>

68
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 2>Iran were Marxists liberals and isn't it</v>
<v Speaker 2>as could all live together,</v>

69
00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:52.210
<v Speaker 2>and this is how the Islamic Revolution</v>

70
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.113
<v Speaker 1>was born.</v>

71
00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.273
<v Speaker 2>November of 1979 revolutionary forces </v>
<v Speaker 2>took over the government palace and the </v>

72
00:04:02.311 --> 00:04:03.144
<v Speaker 2>u s embassy in Tehran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is actually the basis of the movie </v>

73
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:07.590
<v Speaker 2>argo starring Ben Affleck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this movie,</v>

74
00:04:07.591 --> 00:04:08.424
<v Speaker 2>you can see the story of the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers at the embassy being taken </v>

75
00:04:11.281 --> 00:04:13.650
<v Speaker 2>hostage by the Iranians.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right afterwards,</v>

76
00:04:13.651 --> 00:04:16.200
<v Speaker 2>the Ayatollah Khomeini would come back </v>
<v Speaker 2>to his country,</v>

77
00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:17.123
<v Speaker 2>supported by all of his believers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what he said during his </v>

78
00:04:20.911 --> 00:04:21.840
<v Speaker 2>first speech.</v>

79
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.480
<v Speaker 2>There is no need for an Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy.</v>

80
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.300
<v Speaker 2>It is enough with Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was of course,</v>

81
00:04:30.301 --> 00:04:34.200
<v Speaker 2>to eliminate the other revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups that it helps them take a power.</v>

82
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>All of those western liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those Marxists,</v>

83
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:37.704
<v Speaker 2>those social democrats and even moderate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslims were excluded from the new </v>

84
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:41.664
<v Speaker 2>Islamic republic as of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country's relationship with the </v>

85
00:04:43.951 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 2>United States was totally broken.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

86
00:04:46.531 --> 00:04:48.570
<v Speaker 2>actually it was only kinds of broken in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a way.</v>

87
00:04:48.571 --> 00:04:49.404
<v Speaker 2>We could say there's America and Z.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran when from being friends to being </v>

88
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 2>gets complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

89
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.400
<v Speaker 2>on one hand committee hated the u s but </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand was Ronald Reagan.</v>

90
00:04:59.401 --> 00:05:00.234
<v Speaker 2>The American presidents at the time was </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling weapons to the Iranians so they </v>

91
00:05:03.211 --> 00:05:05.650
<v Speaker 2>could fight against them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Neighboring country rock.</v>

92
00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:07.530
<v Speaker 2>Remember Saddam Hussein?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

93
00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.590
<v Speaker 2>he was a common enemy for those </v>
<v Speaker 2>Khomeini,</v>

94
00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:10.453
<v Speaker 2>Dan Duncan,</v>

95
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.823
<v Speaker 1>Sandy,</v>

96
00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.340
<v Speaker 2>1997 the uranians chose a new presidents</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed cut harming,</v>

97
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 2>who tried to restore friendly </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the US,</v>

98
00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:24.173
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the supreme leader who was not Khomeini </v>

99
00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:28.193
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this other one you see on the </v>

100
00:05:30.031 --> 00:05:32.550
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Ayatollah Khomeini,</v>

101
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 2>who had an evergreen obsession with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>

102
00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.790
<v Speaker 2>So he was funding a terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 2>organization called [inaudible].</v>

103
00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:39.763
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

104
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:42.643
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget that any Rhombi ultimate </v>

105
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 2>decision maker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not the president's,</v>

106
00:05:45.171 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 2>but this religious leader who holds the </v>
<v Speaker 2>position of head of state.</v>

107
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.453
<v Speaker 2>The says the American President,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton said he would never the </v>

108
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:52.713
<v Speaker 2>friend,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a country that doesn't want Israel to </v>

109
00:05:54.531 --> 00:05:55.590
<v Speaker 2>exist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

110
00:05:55.591 --> 00:05:56.424
<v Speaker 2>the Ron remained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They divided despite the majority of </v>

111
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:02.000
<v Speaker 2>their population being okay with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radically Islamic leadership.</v>

112
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.180
<v Speaker 2>There is still a big secular movement in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state.</v>

113
00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.950
<v Speaker 2>Then in 2005 something happens that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would change the fate of Iran.</v>

114
00:06:09.951 --> 00:06:10.784
<v Speaker 2>That forever.</v>

115
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:13.500
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

116
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.333
<v Speaker 2>With Act Martinia judge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite what it looks like between the </v>

117
00:06:16.481 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 2>ends of the 1990s and the start of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>new millennium,</v>

118
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.510
<v Speaker 2>Iran had flirted with moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even secularism,</v>

119
00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.373
<v Speaker 2>they even passed a divorce or that </v>
<v Speaker 2>included separation of goods between </v>

120
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:27.680
<v Speaker 2>husband and wife.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

121
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:31.720
<v Speaker 2>but by the year 2006 50% of the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>students were female.</v>

122
00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:32.613
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran was still a systemic and be </v>

123
00:06:33.881 --> 00:06:34.714
<v Speaker 2>violating human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Women were forced to have their heads </v>

124
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:38.840
<v Speaker 2>covered and religious minorities wet the</v>
<v Speaker 2>bidding.</v>

125
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:42.250
<v Speaker 2>But don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about an Islamic republic</v>

126
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.820
<v Speaker 2>in neighboring Saudi Arabia when ons </v>
<v Speaker 2>even allowed to drive.</v>

127
00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.360
<v Speaker 2>But as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this little corner of freedom had not so</v>

128
00:06:49.361 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 2>many fans on the radical Islamic side of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the SPEC.</v>

129
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:52.763
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

130
00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.893
<v Speaker 2>So the Ayatollah Khomeini used all his </v>
<v Speaker 2>power to radicalize the public opinion </v>

131
00:06:58.741 --> 00:07:00.420
<v Speaker 2>against the president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yet they meet.</v>

132
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:04.920
<v Speaker 2>And this is how in 2005 this other guy </v>
<v Speaker 2>with an impossible to pronounce,</v>

133
00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:09.921
<v Speaker 2>name won the elections would act.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Martinia judge is how a radical accounts</v>

134
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:15.490
<v Speaker 2>or reform process started in Iran </v>
<v Speaker 2>tortures.</v>

135
00:07:15.491 --> 00:07:18.310
<v Speaker 2>Then detentions increased significantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>after this year,</v>

136
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:22.030
<v Speaker 2>at least chase down women who wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>wear the head job properly and the whole</v>

137
00:07:22.031 --> 00:07:24.400
<v Speaker 2>world was shocked by quotes like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>one.</v>

138
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:25.343
<v Speaker 3>Bye Daddy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You don't want to have the of Hanjin </v>

139
00:07:26.291 --> 00:07:31.020
<v Speaker 3>spas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We don't have homosexuals like country.</v>

140
00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:33.703
<v Speaker 2>The the ultimate concern for Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was the Uranian attempt to do build </v>

141
00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:37.693
<v Speaker 2>their own nuclear bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty scary to imagine the </v>

142
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:40.944
<v Speaker 2>possibilities when a government that </v>
<v Speaker 2>publicly declared their intention to </v>

143
00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:46.740
<v Speaker 2>raise Israel from the map and to use </v>
<v Speaker 2>president denies the Holocaust,</v>

144
00:07:46.860 --> 00:07:47.693
<v Speaker 2>has a new BUBBA,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran hates Saudi Arabia and other </v>

145
00:07:53.291 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 2>relationships that would be complicated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Iran having the bomb.</v>

146
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 2>We're actually going to talk more about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Iran Saudi Arabia relationship in an</v>

147
00:08:00.251 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 2>upcoming video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so be sure to subscribe to this channel.</v>

148
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:04.480
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you don't want to miss that,</v>

149
00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 2>and this is the moment when American has</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran changed their relationship status.</v>

150
00:08:09.161 --> 00:08:09.994
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this time that went from it's </v>

151
00:08:11.501 --> 00:08:12.730
<v Speaker 2>complicated to,</v>

152
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:15.950
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

153
00:08:15.950 --> 00:08:16.783
<v Speaker 2>dirty council and poses sanctions on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran for failure to holt uranium </v>

154
00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:22.453
<v Speaker 2>enrichment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Islamic republic became a real </v>

155
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:25.814
<v Speaker 2>danger to international stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These sanctions were no small thing </v>

156
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:29.931
<v Speaker 2>either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Number,</v>

157
00:08:29.931 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 2>how Iran has the four for larger,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's crude oil reserves in the wells.</v>

158
00:08:33.170 --> 00:08:34.003
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economy of Iran unsurprisingly does </v>

159
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:36.644
<v Speaker 2>rely on these exports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So imagine what would happen when the </v>

160
00:08:39.051 --> 00:08:39.884
<v Speaker 2>wealthiest countries in the world just </v>
<v Speaker 2>stopped buying as since January or </v>

161
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:46.583
<v Speaker 2>Ramian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Government figures show the prices of </v>

162
00:08:48.381 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 2>bread,</v>
<v Speaker 2>milk,</v>

163
00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:50.504
<v Speaker 2>and meat have risen around 20% well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the price of chicken has jumped about </v>

164
00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:55.453
<v Speaker 2>80% since January.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranian government figures show the </v>

165
00:08:58.021 --> 00:08:58.854
<v Speaker 2>prices of bread and milk and meats have </v>
<v Speaker 2>risen around 20% while the price of </v>

166
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 2>chicken has jumped about 80% but do wait</v>
<v Speaker 2>for just a second because Oh yes,</v>

167
00:09:05.731 --> 00:09:06.564
<v Speaker 2>the best is yet to come.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The economic crisis destroyed our </v>

168
00:09:09.210 --> 00:09:10.043
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Janse reputation and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>successor and current President Hassan </v>

169
00:09:13.620 --> 00:09:14.453
<v Speaker 2>Rouhani came to power under the promise </v>
<v Speaker 2>of liberal reforms and better </v>

170
00:09:16.981 --> 00:09:17.814
<v Speaker 2>relationships with the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is where things started to get </v>

171
00:09:20.671 --> 00:09:21.610
<v Speaker 2>very interesting.</v>

172
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:23.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

173
00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.220
<v Speaker 2>The Arab spring,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran is a Shia Islamic country.</v>

174
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.220
<v Speaker 2>Inside the Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shia Islam is a minority.</v>

175
00:09:30.250 --> 00:09:31.083
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons why the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iranian ayatollah is have such a bad </v>

176
00:09:33.281 --> 00:09:35.550
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the Sunni clergy in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi.</v>

177
00:09:35.551 --> 00:09:35.690
<v Speaker 2>Right</v>

178
00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:36.523
<v Speaker 1>radio</v>

179
00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 2>is the reason why Iran is willing to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatever they can to fight dash,</v>

180
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:46.074
<v Speaker 2>also known as Islamic states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bosch is a Sunni Muslim terrorist </v>

181
00:09:48.871 --> 00:09:50.310
<v Speaker 2>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add to this.</v>

182
00:09:50.311 --> 00:09:52.950
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that once America removed </v>
<v Speaker 2>did strips from Iraq,</v>

183
00:09:52.951 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 2>the Ifo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Liz funded the new government in Baghdad</v>

184
00:09:55.560 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 2>and we can explain the following serious</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Bashar Al Assad says,</v>

185
00:09:59.161 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 2>the Liberation of Aleppo from terrorists</v>
<v Speaker 2>is not only a victory for the mask is,</v>

186
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 2>but also adults who participated in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fight against terror,</v>

187
00:10:06.150 --> 00:10:06.983
<v Speaker 2>especially Ron and wash up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Iranian army is fighting Islamic </v>

188
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:11.880
<v Speaker 2>states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both in Syria and in Iraq.</v>

189
00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 2>And this is both a help as well as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>threat to the United States.</v>

190
00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.313
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to find one radical group </v>
<v Speaker 2>just for it to be replaced with a more </v>

191
00:10:18.661 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>radical one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

192
00:10:19.861 --> 00:10:22.920
<v Speaker 2>this explains why Obama has an interest </v>
<v Speaker 2>in building ties with them</v>

193
00:10:23.020 --> 00:10:23.853
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

194
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:26.773
<v Speaker 2>It was a pretty small but your fam </v>
<v Speaker 2>because he hit two targets with one </v>

195
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:29.894
<v Speaker 2>shot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now on the one hand is if I'm always </v>

196
00:10:30.951 --> 00:10:31.784
<v Speaker 2>sending a signal to Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not willing to help and fight </v>

197
00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:34.933
<v Speaker 2>dash on that hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is saying whoever defeats the bad </v>

198
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:40.340
<v Speaker 2>guys will have a good relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s moreover,</v>

199
00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:41.263
<v Speaker 2>he would finally see it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an agreement with Iran in order to stop </v>

200
00:10:43.191 --> 00:10:44.024
<v Speaker 2>their nuclear program.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is how they close the famously </v>

201
00:10:46.521 --> 00:10:47.354
<v Speaker 2>controversial Iranian nuclear deal under</v>
<v Speaker 2>the nuclear deal that we are allies and </v>

202
00:10:51.501 --> 00:10:54.560
<v Speaker 2>partners reached with Iran last year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>

203
00:10:54.561 --> 00:10:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Ron will not get a tans on a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 2>bomb.</v>

204
00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.953
<v Speaker 2>The region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States and the world will be </v>

205
00:11:02.001 --> 00:11:07.001
<v Speaker 2>more secure nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama success that Donald Trump wants to</v>

206
00:11:08.911 --> 00:11:09.744
<v Speaker 2>stop this diplomatic process,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though the courts have vetoed his </v>

207
00:11:12.331 --> 00:11:13.164
<v Speaker 2>infamous Islam ban.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that he included Iran on the </v>

208
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 2>list of countries that cannot get into </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

209
00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:20.550
<v Speaker 2>There's a clear signal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He is slamming the door on Iran.</v>

210
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:23.400
<v Speaker 2>More importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's showing some love for Saudi Arabia,</v>

211
00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.560
<v Speaker 2>but this is something we've covered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>another video.</v>

212
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:26.394
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to understand why Donald</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump is such a good friend of the </v>

213
00:11:28.411 --> 00:11:30.120
<v Speaker 2>Saudis,</v>

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:36.420

216
00:11:36.570 --> 00:11:39.780
<v Speaker 2>Cam America restore their relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Iran.</v>

217
00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:41.770
<v Speaker 2>Is it worth it in order to encourage </v>
<v Speaker 2>around?</v>

218
00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
