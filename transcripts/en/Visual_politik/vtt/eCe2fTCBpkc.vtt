00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.343
<v Speaker 1>The global competency lab is a region </v>
<v Speaker 1>with 12 countries that have just one </v>

2
00:00:11.691 --> 00:00:13.700
<v Speaker 1>thing in common and that's that they all</v>
<v Speaker 1>hate each other.</v>

3
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:14.683
<v Speaker 1>For decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of these countries were a big part </v>

4
00:00:16.971 --> 00:00:17.804
<v Speaker 1>of a federation called Yugoslavia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had a socialist system very </v>

5
00:00:21.201 --> 00:00:26.201
<v Speaker 1>similar to that of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After the fall of communism,</v>

6
00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:31.553
<v Speaker 1>the Yugoslavian estate broke apart and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the regions separated from each </v>

7
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:35.724
<v Speaker 1>other in the most violent way possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either about my age or slightly older </v>

8
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.594
<v Speaker 1>you might remember the terrible bulk and</v>
<v Speaker 1>was a showcase of the worst part of the </v>

9
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:44.274
<v Speaker 1>human condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As all of this happens just a few </v>

10
00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.510
<v Speaker 1>kilometers away from Italy and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>

11
00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.590
<v Speaker 1>so while the rest of Europe enjoyed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and peaceful existence,</v>

12
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.230
<v Speaker 1>this region's inhabitants were killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.833
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Balkans in one of Europe's poorest </v>

14
00:01:00.851 --> 00:01:03.820
<v Speaker 1>regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people call it the Bermuda triangle</v>

15
00:01:03.821 --> 00:01:04.654
<v Speaker 1>of economics because when someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>invests that money mysteriously </v>

16
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:08.854
<v Speaker 1>disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably new country like Albania is a </v>

17
00:01:10.421 --> 00:01:11.254
<v Speaker 1>bit like traveling 50 years in the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other countries like Serbia or growing </v>

18
00:01:14.651 --> 00:01:15.484
<v Speaker 1>fairly fast lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are still miles away from </v>

19
00:01:17.111 --> 00:01:21.900
<v Speaker 1>being able to join the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>

20
00:01:21.901 --> 00:01:25.650
<v Speaker 1>which is the best boy in the classroom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is bankrupt and has an unemployment rate</v>

21
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:26.484
<v Speaker 1>of 21 percent and otherwise this doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>look like a good country for doing </v>

22
00:01:29.791 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

23
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you A.</v>

24
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.450
<v Speaker 1>China thinks it is.</v>

25
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

26
00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.143
<v Speaker 1>China is putting billions of pounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of investment into Greece and </v>

27
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:39.924
<v Speaker 1>other Balkan countries to create a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>silk road from the Mediterranean into </v>

28
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>the heart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The European Union,</v>

29
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.120
<v Speaker 1>we aren't talking about almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>$20,000,000,000.</v>

30
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.983
<v Speaker 1>This is the same cost as hosting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic Games and it's all in a region </v>

31
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 1>where nobody else seems to invest a </v>
<v Speaker 1>penny.</v>

32
00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.253
<v Speaker 1>China is bought harbor and is now </v>
<v Speaker 1>building brand new railroads that will </v>

33
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:58.914
<v Speaker 1>connect to the Balkans with Budapest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary and that might ended up in </v>

34
00:02:01.951 --> 00:02:03.630
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.780
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government is paving the way</v>
<v Speaker 1>for private investments.</v>

36
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.673
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine Chinese factories on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>outskirts of Belgrade and Alley Express </v>

37
00:02:11.101 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>logistics center in the middle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Athens?</v>

38
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.793
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might be a reality sooner than you </v>

39
00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:15.800
<v Speaker 1>might have</v>

40
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.633
<v Speaker 2>facts</v>

41
00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.733
<v Speaker 1>for better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at it relative to that </v>

42
00:02:22.381 --> 00:02:23.214
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is showing a bigger interest in </v>

43
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia than it is in Germany,</v>

44
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.990
<v Speaker 1>so now the question is why is China so </v>
<v Speaker 1>interested in the Balkans?</v>

45
00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Isn't this a poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt,</v>

46
00:02:33.271 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 1>and business unfriendly region?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is China trying to achieve here?</v>

47
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.863
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer all of </v>

48
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:39.604
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as usual before we do a second look </v>

49
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:46.711
<v Speaker 1>back at the history tree for sale in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>year 2010,</v>

50
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.644
<v Speaker 1>Greece started that budget cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole country was bankrupt and the </v>

51
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 1>European Union agreed to bail them out </v>
<v Speaker 1>with money from it's wealthiest members.</v>

52
00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.253
<v Speaker 1>Boss can exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Greek government was supposed to </v>

53
00:03:01.941 --> 00:03:04.310
<v Speaker 1>control that spending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

54
00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.230
<v Speaker 1>Greece has gone through all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and financial crisis.</v>

55
00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:10.340
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment Sims,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't stop growing.</v>

56
00:03:10.341 --> 00:03:13.520
<v Speaker 1>It's now at more than 20 percent since </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty is on the rise too,</v>

57
00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.473
<v Speaker 1>for a better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek public desk is almost twice that </v>

58
00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:18.193
<v Speaker 1>of their entire gross domestic product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all of this grease seems </v>

59
00:03:22.011 --> 00:03:23.840
<v Speaker 1>to be allergic to business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ev,</v>

60
00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.430
<v Speaker 1>rampant corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>red tape,</v>

61
00:03:25.431 --> 00:03:26.264
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of laws that have created </v>
<v Speaker 1>a country with almost no major </v>

62
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:30.344
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

63
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.113
<v Speaker 1>Brussels demands is that the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Alexis Tsipras make reforms and sell </v>

64
00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:38.253
<v Speaker 1>the state owned companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was a big problem here being </v>

65
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.943
<v Speaker 1>in the situation that they were.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wanted to buy the Greek </v>

66
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:45.064
<v Speaker 1>governments property,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they simply had to drop their prices </v>

67
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.120
<v Speaker 1>to rock bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

68
00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.350
<v Speaker 1>Greece was and still is in a desperate </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation now,</v>

69
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>guests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can smell desperation from miles and</v>

70
00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:57.520
<v Speaker 1>miles away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

71
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.443
<v Speaker 1>That would be China.</v>

72
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>China's costco acquires 51 percent stake</v>
<v Speaker 1>in pirates passport.</v>

73
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.653
<v Speaker 1>When this deal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China was killing two birds with one </v>

74
00:04:08.581 --> 00:04:09.690
<v Speaker 1>stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

75
00:04:09.691 --> 00:04:10.524
<v Speaker 1>it's one of their companies was buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the main ports in the </v>

76
00:04:12.301 --> 00:04:13.134
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean seat on the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government of Xi Jinping with his </v>

77
00:04:15.631 --> 00:04:16.464
<v Speaker 1>commitments to investing at 3 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>more dollars in the country was buying </v>

78
00:04:19.441 --> 00:04:22.560
<v Speaker 1>it from this angle ally in sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the EU and.</v>

79
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:22.921
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

80
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you'll now thinking.</v>

81
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:25.194
<v Speaker 1>The Greek presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alexis suppressed the European left </v>

82
00:04:27.721 --> 00:04:28.554
<v Speaker 1>Rockstar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the man who would never sell his </v>

83
00:04:30.031 --> 00:04:30.864
<v Speaker 1>principles to an evil rich guy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No matter how much money was put on the </v>

84
00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:33.880
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

85
00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:34.743
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need that.</v>

86
00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.930
<v Speaker 3>Breeze blocks used criticism at UN of </v>
<v Speaker 3>China's human rights record.</v>

87
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.033
<v Speaker 3>Greece has vetoed a European Union </v>
<v Speaker 3>condemnation of China's human rights </v>

88
00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:51.540
<v Speaker 3>record at the UN infuriating diplomats </v>
<v Speaker 3>and rights organizations.</v>

89
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.860
<v Speaker 3>You said the move undermine that used </v>
<v Speaker 3>position as a defender of human,</v>

90
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.933
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

91
00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:01.753
<v Speaker 1>Just a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is not only about politics </v>

92
00:05:03.861 --> 00:05:06.590
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at it from an economic</v>

93
00:05:06.591 --> 00:05:07.520
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

94
00:05:07.521 --> 00:05:11.060
<v Speaker 1>a Chinese company controls one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest ports in Europe.</v>

95
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.953
<v Speaker 1>This means Chinese businesses will find </v>
<v Speaker 1>it easier than ever to reload their </v>

96
00:05:14.451 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>products into one of the wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets on the planet.</v>

97
00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:20.960
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still has a little problem here from</v>

98
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:22.640
<v Speaker 1>the Pi report.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlin,</v>

99
00:05:22.641 --> 00:05:26.870
<v Speaker 1>we have more than 2000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 kilometers of distance on the way.</v>

100
00:05:26.871 --> 00:05:30.560
<v Speaker 1>We have poor countries with poor roads </v>
<v Speaker 1>and poor railways,</v>

101
00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.520
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a second day because </v>
<v Speaker 1>China has already thought of this.</v>

102
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the one belt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One road projects.</v>

103
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 1>This is brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Silk Road,</v>

104
00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.600
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping wants to create.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a network of infrastructure that</v>

105
00:05:41.601 --> 00:05:42.434
<v Speaker 1>is meant to connect the entire wells and</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe the silkroad will go through </v>

106
00:05:46.161 --> 00:05:46.994
<v Speaker 1>the Balkans.</v>

107
00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.110
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

108
00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:54.750
<v Speaker 1>Budapest railway construction starts at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

109
00:05:54.751 --> 00:05:58.850
<v Speaker 1>Chinese consulting companies are working</v>
<v Speaker 1>to renovate railroads between Greece and</v>

110
00:05:58.851 --> 00:05:59.684
<v Speaker 1>Macedonia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal is to be able to have one </v>

111
00:06:01.161 --> 00:06:01.994
<v Speaker 1>shipment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madigan pirates and crossing the whole </v>

112
00:06:03.561 --> 00:06:06.800
<v Speaker 1>Balkan peninsula at a hundred and 60 </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers an hour,</v>

113
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.870
<v Speaker 1>and all of this is cheaper to build here</v>
<v Speaker 1>than intercity.</v>

114
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

115
00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:14.960
<v Speaker 1>The vulcans have cheap land,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap salaries and their governments are</v>

116
00:06:14.961 --> 00:06:17.300
<v Speaker 1>welcoming this Chinese money with open </v>
<v Speaker 1>arms.</v>

117
00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.223
<v Speaker 1>As we said at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Balkans still feel a bit like the </v>

118
00:06:20.031 --> 00:06:25.031
<v Speaker 1>aftermath of the wars from the 19th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me see sooner like Bill Craig,</v>

119
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.450
<v Speaker 1>you can still see the ruins from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>NATO bombings in 1999.</v>

120
00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.433
<v Speaker 1>A country like Montenegro doesn't even </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a railroad that connects it with </v>

121
00:06:32.961 --> 00:06:35.570
<v Speaker 1>Bosnia or Croatia despite sharing a </v>
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>

122
00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:38.430
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget that except for Greece and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coratia,</v>

123
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:39.403
<v Speaker 1>none of these countries are you members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that they hardly get any </v>

124
00:06:41.991 --> 00:06:44.930
<v Speaker 1>Brussels money to rebuild,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these Chinese loans,</v>

125
00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:50.060
<v Speaker 1>$70 from heaven speak about this with </v>
<v Speaker 1>European countries.</v>

126
00:06:52.271 --> 00:06:53.560
<v Speaker 1>They say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why China?</v>

127
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:55.660
<v Speaker 1>Because they have the money to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>honest.</v>

128
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.100
<v Speaker 1>Zerana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z,</v>

129
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:00.130
<v Speaker 1>Milosevic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serbian minister of transportation,</v>

130
00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:03.670
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a second here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the end of the story.</v>

131
00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:05.980
<v Speaker 1>What if China wants to go even further?</v>

132
00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Trainees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>factories in Europe,</v>

133
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.043
<v Speaker 1>we'll know it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China started grabbing thanks to the </v>

134
00:07:15.461 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies that set up in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>special economic science,</v>

135
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:19.624
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is the real appeal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>China during the nineties was the lower </v>

136
00:07:22.301 --> 00:07:24.910
<v Speaker 1>wages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however things they've now changed.</v>

137
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:25.823
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this chart today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average salary in a city like </v>

138
00:07:31.571 --> 00:07:32.404
<v Speaker 1>Shanghai is almost the same as that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece and almost double that of the </v>

139
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Saudi and salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means for a Chinese company,</v>

140
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.800
<v Speaker 1>Sedia is something close to what Shen </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zen used to be for an American.</v>

141
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.693
<v Speaker 1>There's also the fact that said the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uneducation is relatively good and </v>

142
00:07:45.281 --> 00:07:47.560
<v Speaker 1>they're close to Germany in summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap labor,</v>

143
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:48.453
<v Speaker 1>well educated population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's close to one of the world's </v>

144
00:07:50.231 --> 00:07:55.231
<v Speaker 1>most appealing markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an unexplored paradise.</v>

145
00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.980
<v Speaker 1>China's Habib signs agreement to buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>serving steel plant.</v>

146
00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:02.993
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this news is from 2016 and we still </v>

147
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:05.934
<v Speaker 1>don't have that many examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that aren't enough cases to show a </v>

148
00:08:09.241 --> 00:08:10.074
<v Speaker 1>clear trends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies want to start </v>

149
00:08:11.761 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing things in Europe and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Balkans.</v>

150
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:16.500
<v Speaker 1>Other perfect place to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most specifically.</v>

151
00:08:16.650 --> 00:08:19.200
<v Speaker 1>Then looking at Sandia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this explains why this year,</v>

152
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:20.043
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping himself paid a visit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Belgrade or why Huawei has already </v>

153
00:08:23.671 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Speaker 1>invested at a fortune to improved </v>
<v Speaker 1>telecommunications in the country.</v>

154
00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 2017.</v>

155
00:08:28.291 --> 00:08:30.840
<v Speaker 1>The Bank of China opens their first </v>
<v Speaker 1>Serbian officers.</v>

156
00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.870
<v Speaker 1>So in a way we could say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between these two countries</v>

157
00:08:33.900 --> 00:08:35.430
<v Speaker 1>where it really couldn't be any better </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

158
00:08:39.580 --> 00:08:41.200
<v Speaker 1>but I can probably guess what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>

159
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:42.034
<v Speaker 1>I mean very rarely a visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do we tell you that corruption is a </v>

160
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:47.560
<v Speaker 1>friend of foreign investments and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes to corruption,</v>

161
00:08:47.570 --> 00:08:50.920
<v Speaker 1>sedia certainly starts to look less like</v>
<v Speaker 1>a paradise,</v>

162
00:08:50.980 --> 00:08:54.190
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies are experts in dealing</v>

163
00:08:54.191 --> 00:08:54.930
<v Speaker 1>with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

164
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>Chinese businessmen are quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable in hostile environments.</v>

165
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v Speaker 1>They have demonstrated this when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>built those textile factories in </v>

166
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's be honest here,</v>

167
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:07.250
<v Speaker 1>China itself isn't exactly a haven of </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency and democracy either.</v>

168
00:09:10.770 --> 00:09:11.603
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as soon as investment came to the </v>

169
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>Balkans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regions fondness for Europe,</v>

170
00:09:14.581 --> 00:09:15.414
<v Speaker 1>it started going down in 2012.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy percent of Serbs wanted to join </v>

171
00:09:18.361 --> 00:09:19.194
<v Speaker 1>the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some people were even willing to change </v>

172
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>that alphabet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do that.</v>

173
00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.513
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Serbian is a Slavic language and it's </v>

174
00:09:25.381 --> 00:09:26.214
<v Speaker 1>written in cyrillic characters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some intellectuals wanted to change it </v>

175
00:09:28.561 --> 00:09:31.150
<v Speaker 1>to a Latin alphabet is the same way you </v>
<v Speaker 1>Croatians dips,</v>

176
00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:31.830
<v Speaker 1>but now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

177
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 1>this love of Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's dropped to 35 percent at the end of</v>

178
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:37.230
<v Speaker 1>the day with money flowing into China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.290
<v Speaker 1>he really wants Brussels funding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In past presidential elections,</v>

180
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:43.080
<v Speaker 1>none of the main candidates talked about</v>
<v Speaker 1>joining the European Union.</v>

181
00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.033
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody in Brussels seemed to be too </v>

182
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:46.224
<v Speaker 1>worried about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said only China has been capable of </v>

183
00:09:50.931 --> 00:09:53.390
<v Speaker 1>finding business opportunities in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the world.</v>

184
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:57.200
<v Speaker 1>The rest of Europe still sees this as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and economic desert.</v>

185
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.030
<v Speaker 1>The same happens in many parts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

186
00:09:59.031 --> 00:09:59.864
<v Speaker 1>When nobody dead to invest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden Beijing money came in </v>

187
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:05.810
<v Speaker 1>and now some of these countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing like this note.</v>

188
00:10:10.830 --> 00:10:11.663
<v Speaker 1>So the question is now where we see an </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening in the Balkans is the same </v>

189
00:10:13.501 --> 00:10:14.334
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen it in some African countries </v>

190
00:10:15.610 --> 00:10:18.270
<v Speaker 1>and he could grease Saudi and perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>even Bosnia.</v>

191
00:10:18.271 --> 00:10:21.630
<v Speaker 1>They come a brand new industrial cluster</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Chinese companies.</v>

192
00:10:21.750 --> 00:10:22.583
