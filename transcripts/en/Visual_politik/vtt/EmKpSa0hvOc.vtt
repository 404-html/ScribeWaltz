1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>With a population of over 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

2
00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:03.493
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fourth biggest country in Latin </v>

3
00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.453
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the richest countries in the </v>

4
00:00:07.421 --> 00:00:08.254
<v Speaker 1>world in terms of biodiversity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources in this vast in </v>

5
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:13.603
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can find among other things the </v>

6
00:00:15.521 --> 00:00:16.354
<v Speaker 1>biggest silver reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third biggest zinc and copper </v>

7
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:20.074
<v Speaker 1>reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the sixth biggest gold </v>

8
00:00:21.971 --> 00:00:24.700
<v Speaker 1>reserves in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In today's video,</v>

9
00:00:24.701 --> 00:00:28.960
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be talking all about Peru</v>
<v Speaker 1>equals youtube politic.</v>

10
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:37.573
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru is still ain't poor country and </v>

11
00:00:39.051 --> 00:00:39.884
<v Speaker 1>there is still a lot of work to be done </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to its industrial </v>

12
00:00:42.531 --> 00:00:44.990
<v Speaker 1>framework,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite this,</v>

13
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Peru stands out among its Latin American</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors as an example of it.</v>

14
00:00:49.301 --> 00:00:53.390
<v Speaker 1>Reforms done right and some say that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>this process continues,</v>

15
00:00:53.391 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>we're soon going to be talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru as a great Latin American power.</v>

16
00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.453
<v Speaker 1>Lima,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's capital city already has a higher </v>

17
00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:01.470
<v Speaker 1>GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even</v>

18
00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:05.473
<v Speaker 2>economic</v>

19
00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:08.573
<v Speaker 1>in the last decade has recorded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second biggest growth rate of all </v>

20
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:14.610
<v Speaker 1>countries in Latin America in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

21
00:01:14.611 --> 00:01:15.444
<v Speaker 1>it's GDP has more than doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The investment rate has gone from 13 </v>

22
00:01:19.021 --> 00:01:22.110
<v Speaker 1>percent of GDP to 20 percent under the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty rates.</v>

23
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.160
<v Speaker 1>This is the percentage of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't afford basic things like food,</v>

24
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

25
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and healthcare has dropped from rates of</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 50 percent in the year,</v>

26
00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:35.961
<v Speaker 1>2000 to 22 percent today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a reduction of more than half,</v>

27
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.793
<v Speaker 1>which is not bad at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a country with the highest poverty </v>

28
00:01:41.791 --> 00:01:42.624
<v Speaker 1>reduction rate in Latin America during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 13 years and say on top of all </v>

29
00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.240
<v Speaker 1>that Peru is one of the least indebted </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in Latin America.</v>

30
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:54.090
<v Speaker 1>Bands in fact is one of the least </v>
<v Speaker 1>indebted in the whole world.</v>

31
00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.680
<v Speaker 1>This is due to a strong determination to</v>
<v Speaker 1>use public funds responsibly.</v>

32
00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:59.723
<v Speaker 1>This is an achievement of perused </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous governments which were led by </v>

33
00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.230
<v Speaker 1>Alan Garcia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm Zella on polydor.</v>

34
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 1>Because of these leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the public debt has been reduced to less</v>

35
00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.420
<v Speaker 1>than 50 percent since the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is still.</v>

36
00:02:18.071 --> 00:02:18.904
<v Speaker 1>How did it reach a political consensus </v>
<v Speaker 1>that maintain stability with the </v>

37
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:25.840
<v Speaker 1>government's budget while also making </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro markets policy?</v>

38
00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:31.130
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but one more and go being with them</v>

39
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.383
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is probably one of the most </v>

40
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.214
<v Speaker 1>interesting things about Peru and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>also where they can see each other </v>

41
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:41.904
<v Speaker 1>countries even valuable lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We recently made a video talking about </v>

42
00:02:44.551 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>the disaster that is Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the interesting thing is that peruse</v>

43
00:02:48.211 --> 00:02:52.020
<v Speaker 1>economic situation was pretty similar to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela's in the 19 eighties.</v>

44
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:57.050
<v Speaker 1>So let's have a look at what happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eight,</v>

45
00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:59.470
<v Speaker 1>these prices</v>

46
00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 4>in the 19 seventies and the beginning of</v>
<v Speaker 4>the 19 eighties,</v>

47
00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.800
<v Speaker 4>the Peruvian government bets on boosting</v>
<v Speaker 4>the Peruvian economy,</v>

48
00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:09.663
<v Speaker 4>fruit public investments,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they wanted to replace imports and to </v>

49
00:03:12.011 --> 00:03:15.160
<v Speaker 4>restrict the sale of foreign products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>To achieve this,</v>

50
00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.580
<v Speaker 4>they had to borrow money which shot up </v>
<v Speaker 4>the public debt.</v>

51
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.020
<v Speaker 4>The results were so bad,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the when the oil crisis happened in 1979</v>

52
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:23.973
<v Speaker 4>and their economic growth slowed down,</v>
<v Speaker 4>peruse government started to have so </v>

53
00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:31.981
<v Speaker 4>many problems that in 1983 they had to </v>
<v Speaker 4>suspend their payments to their data's.</v>

54
00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:33.393
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they failed to pay their debts because </v>

55
00:03:34.751 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 4>they ran out of money and the Peruvian </v>
<v Speaker 4>government collapsed.</v>

56
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.280
<v Speaker 4>From that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>things went from bad to worse,</v>

57
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.130
<v Speaker 4>and when Alan Garcia came to power in </v>
<v Speaker 4>1985,</v>

58
00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 4>the entire country was a bit of a </v>
<v Speaker 4>disaster.</v>

59
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 4>This is when the government started to </v>
<v Speaker 4>intervene on a massive scale.</v>

60
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.430
<v Speaker 4>They started fixing prices and in the </v>
<v Speaker 4>labor markets,</v>

61
00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 4>they reinforced the inboard replacement </v>
<v Speaker 4>policies which are limited the number of</v>

62
00:03:58.721 --> 00:03:59.554
<v Speaker 4>products that were available to buy and </v>
<v Speaker 4>setting an average tariff which reached </v>

63
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.710
<v Speaker 4>66 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

64
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:13.130
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

65
00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 1>public deficit went through the roof and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the informal economy became the norm,</v>

66
00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.330
<v Speaker 1>so even though there were more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred taxes,</v>

67
00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:23.210
<v Speaker 1>the state simply couldn't collect them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all that,</v>

68
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:26.150
<v Speaker 1>the governments had collapsed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no one wanted to lend them money.</v>

69
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering what exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>did career do?</v>

70
00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started to print more money,</v>

71
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:32.894
<v Speaker 1>which basically made the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berean currency worth about as much as </v>

72
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:37.364
<v Speaker 1>monopoly money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as if all of that wasn't enough for </v>

73
00:04:41.321 --> 00:04:42.154
<v Speaker 1>purview to deal with.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also have to deal with the narco </v>

74
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:48.590
<v Speaker 1>traffic and terrorist actions by groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as Mrta and Sendero Luminoso,</v>

75
00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:49.483
<v Speaker 1>which were causing tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>deaths sold across the country because </v>

76
00:04:53.601 --> 00:04:58.601
<v Speaker 1>we can throw in as soon as band does </v>
<v Speaker 1>inadequate.</v>

77
00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the results of all this wild?</v>

78
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>GDP,</v>

79
00:05:05.271 --> 00:05:06.104
<v Speaker 1>you had dropped by 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further its GDP per capita was similar </v>

80
00:05:09.651 --> 00:05:10.940
<v Speaker 1>to the 19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

81
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Inflation every year was about 7,500 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

82
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:14.983
<v Speaker 1>It was at this point that the World Bank</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognized Peru as one of the poorest </v>

83
00:05:17.991 --> 00:05:22.991
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can throw them,</v>

84
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.300
<v Speaker 1>toby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>me receive,</v>

85
00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.920
<v Speaker 1>but according to the situation was so </v>
<v Speaker 1>grave that the World Bank estimates that</v>

86
00:05:41.961 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 1>if this had never happened for real GDP </v>
<v Speaker 1>and purchasing power parity,</v>

87
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.720
<v Speaker 1>would today be similar to Israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

88
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.040
<v Speaker 1>or South Korea's no more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no less.</v>

89
00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.933
<v Speaker 1>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crisis that Peru faced was very </v>

90
00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:56.960
<v Speaker 1>similar to the crisis facing Venezuela </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

91
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see lots of public spending,</v>

92
00:05:59.361 --> 00:06:01.640
<v Speaker 1>potency of taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of printing money,</v>

93
00:06:01.641 --> 00:06:03.410
<v Speaker 1>or dropping the price of commodities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:06:03.411 --> 00:06:04.244
<v Speaker 1>and also plenty of violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when we released our video about </v>

95
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.664
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many people asked what we would do to </v>

96
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 1>solve the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at what [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>did</v>

98
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.310
<v Speaker 5>way to prosperity.</v>

99
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.543
<v Speaker 1>90 a strong plan of reforms and economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilization began and in fact this is </v>

100
00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:28.050
<v Speaker 1>the same plan that really does still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist today.</v>

101
00:06:28.170 --> 00:06:31.680
<v Speaker 1>It passed through the following stages </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to slow down inflation.</v>

102
00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:34.800
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the it was replaced by a new currency,</v>

103
00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:36.960
<v Speaker 1>the new sole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to this,</v>

104
00:06:36.961 --> 00:06:39.480
<v Speaker 1>the dollarization over the economy was </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed,</v>

105
00:06:39.481 --> 00:06:43.080
<v Speaker 1>which is essentially where US dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>are used in place of a national currency</v>

106
00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.530
<v Speaker 1>from vast moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monetary stability in the country became</v>

107
00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.393
<v Speaker 1>a national priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tax system was changed and greatly </v>

108
00:06:50.161 --> 00:06:53.010
<v Speaker 1>simplified with the elimination of 64 </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>

109
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pension system was also reformed and</v>

110
00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:56.813
<v Speaker 1>the Chilean system was used as a model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there were also many improvements </v>

111
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:00.414
<v Speaker 1>made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually quite a controversial </v>

112
00:07:01.981 --> 00:07:02.814
<v Speaker 1>topic and something that we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be addressing in a future of visual </v>

113
00:07:04.921 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>politic videos like don't forget to </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribe.</v>

114
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:08.123
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an ambitious program to attract </v>

115
00:07:09.211 --> 00:07:10.044
<v Speaker 1>investors and privatized public </v>
<v Speaker 1>utilities was put into motion Syrian </v>

116
00:07:13.351 --> 00:07:14.184
<v Speaker 1>companies such as Aero Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Electra Lehman and the Peruvian </v>

117
00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:17.994
<v Speaker 1>telephone company will put into private </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands a trade openness strategy was put </v>

118
00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 1>into place which reduced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculously high,</v>

119
00:07:23.941 --> 00:07:28.320
<v Speaker 1>66 percent tariff to something closer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point five percent.</v>

120
00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:29.840
<v Speaker 1>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As this happened,</v>

121
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:34.800
<v Speaker 1>numerous free trade deals were signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a very important ones with the</v>

122
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.300
<v Speaker 1>United States as well as the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

123
00:07:36.510 --> 00:07:37.343
<v Speaker 1>Then in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a gradual decentralization of power </v>

124
00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:40.794
<v Speaker 1>started happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result of this was that most public </v>

125
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:46.620
<v Speaker 1>investment spending today happens with </v>
<v Speaker 1>regions and municipalities,</v>

126
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:47.543
<v Speaker 1>and finally and probably the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important points was their commitments </v>

127
00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:52.433
<v Speaker 1>to budgetary stability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that since it was put </v>

128
00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:57.890
<v Speaker 1>into place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every government has respected.</v>

129
00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:01.383
<v Speaker 1>It's talking about consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually in 1999 and law was put </v>

130
00:08:09.751 --> 00:08:13.350
<v Speaker 1>into place called the fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 1>transparency and prudent snore.</v>

131
00:08:13.530 --> 00:08:14.363
<v Speaker 1>This restricts the discretionary power </v>
<v Speaker 1>of governments to spend more than they </v>

132
00:08:17.161 --> 00:08:17.994
<v Speaker 1>receive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes correct developments for </v>

133
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:23.430
<v Speaker 1>public deficit situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many experts on the subject contest.</v>

134
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.100
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the most important laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the history of Peru bus.</v>

135
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:29.003
<v Speaker 1>It's not all roses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't think that we've forgotten the </v>

136
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:36.110
<v Speaker 1>dark side of this was the nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell him his regime.</v>

137
00:08:36.630 --> 00:08:41.630
<v Speaker 1>This was an authoritarian regime and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of it is now serving a 25 year</v>

138
00:08:41.761 --> 00:08:42.594
<v Speaker 1>jail time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was convicted for crimes against </v>

139
00:08:44.131 --> 00:08:44.964
<v Speaker 1>humanity and its corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was important to keep in mind is </v>

140
00:08:47.201 --> 00:08:48.034
<v Speaker 1>the situation that Venezuela faces today</v>
<v Speaker 1>is similar to the situation that </v>

141
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] faced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So keep in mind there's always a way out</v>

142
00:08:59.130 --> 00:08:59.963
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

143
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>So now you might have in your mind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

144
00:09:03.601 --> 00:09:04.434
<v Speaker 1>why is Peru still a poor country today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said at the beginning of this </v>

145
00:09:08.131 --> 00:09:10.530
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the institutional shortfalls ends,</v>

146
00:09:10.531 --> 00:09:14.070
<v Speaker 1>the challenges that faces today on many </v>
<v Speaker 1>among them.</v>

147
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>We can't stress enough the high degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>of legal uncertainty and corruption.</v>

148
00:09:18.640 --> 00:09:22.170
<v Speaker 1>This is something that we can definitely</v>
<v Speaker 1>see with the death squads case.</v>

149
00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>This is where under his regime from 2011</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 2015,</v>

150
00:09:26.580 --> 00:09:28.890
<v Speaker 1>a group of policemen killed innocent </v>
<v Speaker 1>people for money.</v>

151
00:09:29.010 --> 00:09:29.843
<v Speaker 1>Those guilds included a general and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>major firm peruse national police </v>

152
00:09:32.910 --> 00:09:33.743
<v Speaker 1>further are extremely high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crime and there's also the chance that </v>

153
00:09:36.241 --> 00:09:38.410
<v Speaker 1>the mining industry will face the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>Renzi,</v>

154
00:09:38.411 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>a problems that one faces today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention,</v>

155
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:41.814
<v Speaker 1>there is a very sharp difference between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the living standards in different </v>

156
00:09:44.191 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the fifth of June,</v>

157
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.323
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second rounds of presidential </v>

158
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:51.294
<v Speaker 1>elections were held where Pedro Pablo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kaczynski was elected as the new </v>

159
00:09:54.811 --> 00:09:55.644
<v Speaker 1>president of the Republic of Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These elections were the closest in </v>

160
00:09:58.891 --> 00:10:02.880
<v Speaker 1>peruse history and cruises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Inscape beat out his rival Keiko for him</v>

161
00:10:02.881 --> 00:10:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Maury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way is Alberto.</v>

162
00:10:04.861 --> 00:10:08.760
<v Speaker 1>For him or his daughter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he beats her by just 40,000 votes.</v>

163
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 1>The policies announced buying Kaczynski </v>
<v Speaker 1>include to keep working on the agenda of</v>

164
00:10:13.321 --> 00:10:16.230
<v Speaker 1>pushing competitiveness and trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness.</v>

165
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.243
<v Speaker 1>In this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has pledged to reduce taxes by 10 </v>

166
00:10:18.961 --> 00:10:19.794
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The smes that small or medium sized </v>

167
00:10:21.391 --> 00:10:22.224
<v Speaker 1>enterprises as well as battle against </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy remove unnecessary </v>

168
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:30.621
<v Speaker 1>regulations and to pursue regional </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic integrations similar to the TPP</v>

169
00:10:30.721 --> 00:10:32.110
<v Speaker 1>or RCP led by teachers,</v>

170
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:38.720
<v Speaker 1>ski against to remain at the helmet </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial,</v>

171
00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:39.593
<v Speaker 1>all of the problems that are affecting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru despite his relative political </v>

172
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 1>weakness because they're not very </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly congress,</v>

173
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:45.473
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure that the grief of Peru will </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue and will remain a leader in </v>

174
00:10:48.691 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 1>growth for Latin America and maybe in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>

175
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:52.194
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a young nation with an average </v>

176
00:10:53.251 --> 00:10:54.084
<v Speaker 1>age of 27,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could follow the example of the Asian </v>

177
00:10:56.311 --> 00:11:00.480
<v Speaker 1>tigers and it gets transformed into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>major global power.</v>

178
00:11:00.570 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So that is our opinion here.</v>

<v Speaker 1>and become an economic powerhouse and </v>

181
00:11:10.021 --> 00:11:12.630
