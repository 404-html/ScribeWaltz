1
00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:08.113
<v Speaker 1>The country with the highest density of </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous musicians put our capital in the </v>

2
00:00:10.831 --> 00:00:11.664
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland is a country with less than 5 </v>

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.800
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Boston has a larger population,</v>

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.663
<v Speaker 1>but as small as the population maybe </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland is the cradle of well known </v>

5
00:00:20.881 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>music like any of the cranberries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course Bano for view.</v>

6
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:25.263
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

7
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.100
<v Speaker 1>there is another thing that makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland's famous as well,</v>

8
00:00:29.101 --> 00:00:29.934
<v Speaker 1>and that's the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the second wealthiest country in </v>

9
00:00:32.101 --> 00:00:32.934
<v Speaker 1>the eurozone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further Irish people have more money </v>

10
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>than the British or even the Swiss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is surprising given the just 30</v>

11
00:00:38.431 --> 00:00:41.280
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ireland was as poor as Greece.</v>

12
00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right back then,</v>

13
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.733
<v Speaker 1>one in every five Irish university </v>
<v Speaker 1>students were emigrating to other </v>

14
00:00:47.011 --> 00:00:47.940
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

15
00:00:47.941 --> 00:00:51.750
<v Speaker 1>there are more people with Irish blood </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in the US or Australia than there</v>

16
00:00:51.751 --> 00:00:52.584
<v Speaker 1>are in Ireland</v>

17
00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:53.583
<v Speaker 2>self</v>

18
00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.223
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this country is home to some of the </v>

19
00:00:59.491 --> 00:01:00.324
<v Speaker 1>world's leading technological companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Firms like apple or Google have their </v>

20
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:06.750
<v Speaker 1>tax headquarters that many of you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be thinking now that that simply because</v>

21
00:01:06.751 --> 00:01:07.584
<v Speaker 1>of the low taxes there right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course it is absolutely true that </v>

22
00:01:10.441 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Ireland does offer good fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions for companies,</v>

23
00:01:13.591 --> 00:01:14.424
<v Speaker 1>but other countries like the Republic of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberia or the seashells also offer </v>

24
00:01:17.251 --> 00:01:21.450
<v Speaker 1>pretty low corporate taxes and then not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even half as rich as ours.</v>

25
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>The question here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what have they done to grow so fast?</v>

26
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.030
<v Speaker 1>How is it that even after the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

27
00:01:31.031 --> 00:01:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Ireland remains wealthier than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland?</v>

28
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Did I?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to answer this question,</v>

29
00:01:35.021 --> 00:01:35.854
<v Speaker 1>but first as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a look at the </v>

30
00:01:36.851 --> 00:01:37.684
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

31
00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.040
<v Speaker 3>The poorest of the wealthiest</v>

32
00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.043
<v Speaker 1>islands was born in 1922 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before that the whole island was </v>

33
00:01:45.661 --> 00:01:49.020
<v Speaker 1>part of the British crown.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I ended the relationship well.</v>

34
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.420
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't exactly great for the English </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

35
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:52.254
<v Speaker 1>Island was a lens of Catholic peasants </v>
<v Speaker 1>who were unwilling to work and devoted </v>

36
00:01:55.141 --> 00:01:55.974
<v Speaker 1>to having lots and lots of children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why after they got their </v>

37
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New Republic of Ireland is cut.</v>

38
00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>All of that ties with London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:02.221 --> 00:02:06.030
<v Speaker 1>actually it wasn't just London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they closed off their relationships with</v>

40
00:02:06.031 --> 00:02:11.031
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the world as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even during World War Two,</v>

41
00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>they were the only English speaking </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that captain neutral,</v>

42
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.273
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different Irish governments closed </v>

43
00:02:18.461 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 1>their gates to international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even put a ban on foreign as owning</v>

44
00:02:22.461 --> 00:02:25.160
<v Speaker 1>or investing in local companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the question is,</v>

45
00:02:25.161 --> 00:02:27.380
<v Speaker 1>what was the outcome of all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies?</v>

46
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:28.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knows that that would be a brutal </v>

47
00:02:29.301 --> 00:02:30.350
<v Speaker 1>economic crisis.</v>

48
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.760
<v Speaker 3>Fortunately enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because Irish people spoke English,</v>

49
00:02:32.761 --> 00:02:34.830
<v Speaker 3>they could easily move to the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States.</v>

50
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.890
<v Speaker 3>We're not talking about adventure just a</v>
<v Speaker 3>few decades.</v>

51
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.323
<v Speaker 3>The Irish population reduced by half,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course the national industry </v>

52
00:02:47.751 --> 00:02:51.290
<v Speaker 3>never grew as it was expected to think </v>
<v Speaker 3>about it in such a small country,</v>

53
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.183
<v Speaker 3>it is impossible to find the tools and </v>
<v Speaker 3>resources needed to build factories and </v>

54
00:02:55.851 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 3>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There just isn't enough industry.</v>

55
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 3>They needed to import them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but because</v>

56
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.090
<v Speaker 1>the government put so many fairs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers to foreign trade,</v>

57
00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty hard to get the material </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to start a new company.</v>

58
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.313
<v Speaker 1>This was in 1957.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The governments of Shawn Thomas Kelly </v>

59
00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.810
<v Speaker 1>made islands town or one 80 on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade policy.</v>

60
00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.943
<v Speaker 1>This is how they went from not buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything that's opening their gates to </v>

61
00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:22.861
<v Speaker 1>the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right after that,</v>

62
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.123
<v Speaker 1>they signed a free trade agreement with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK and a decade later they would </v>

63
00:03:27.381 --> 00:03:28.214
<v Speaker 1>enter the European community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which later came to be called the </v>

64
00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:32.900
<v Speaker 1>European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a minute.</v>

65
00:03:32.901 --> 00:03:33.790
<v Speaker 1>My Dad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libertarians,</v>

66
00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Speaker 1>he might be watching this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hold back here and things,</v>

67
00:03:36.501 --> 00:03:37.334
<v Speaker 1>the them for a moment because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>openness to free trade was not exactly </v>

68
00:03:41.271 --> 00:03:42.610
<v Speaker 1>as good as expected.</v>

69
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.180
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

70
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 3>For decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland was closed for business.</v>

71
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 3>I had nationalized many of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies.</v>

72
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.940
<v Speaker 3>When a company knows that they have no </v>
<v Speaker 3>rivals in the market,</v>

73
00:03:54.941 --> 00:03:59.410
<v Speaker 3>share is guaranteed by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have very little reason to improve.</v>

74
00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.333
<v Speaker 3>This explains,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for instance why in 1988 people in the </v>

75
00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:03.784
<v Speaker 3>city of Cork,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is in the southern part of </v>

76
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.273
<v Speaker 3>Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had so many electricity breakdowns and </v>

77
00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:09.303
<v Speaker 3>brownouts,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're wiring network hadn't been </v>

78
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:11.764
<v Speaker 3>replaced for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same happened in many other </v>

79
00:04:14.321 --> 00:04:15.154
<v Speaker 3>industries.</v>

80
00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden the Irish economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed people to buy goods abroad,</v>

81
00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.010
<v Speaker 1>new products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more competitive products.</v>

82
00:04:23.011 --> 00:04:23.844
<v Speaker 1>They appeared in the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you're probably wondering what </v>

83
00:04:26.191 --> 00:04:28.530
<v Speaker 1>happened to those local producers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.733
<v Speaker 1>unsurprisingly they disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ends with thousands of people just lost </v>

85
00:04:33.621 --> 00:04:36.890
<v Speaker 1>their jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1987 islands reached and unemployment</v>

86
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.070
<v Speaker 1>rate up seventeen cents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

87
00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 1>the Irish youth started packing up and </v>
<v Speaker 1>moving.</v>

88
00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:43.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

89
00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Then following visual politics for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>assignment,</v>

90
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.943
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably know that integration </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't really much of a problem for our </v>

91
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:54.490
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess what the real issue is?</v>

92
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it's exactly the opposite.</v>

93
00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.610
<v Speaker 1>The migration we need to consider is who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was leaving audience,</v>

94
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.090
<v Speaker 1>but it was the university students and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it was those people with higher skills.</v>

95
00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:09.270
<v Speaker 1>This cause what is known as a brand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but believe me,</v>

96
00:05:12.401 --> 00:05:15.760
<v Speaker 1>there's more than this in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract the multinational corporations,</v>

97
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.350
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower taxes,</v>

98
00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.720
<v Speaker 1>and of course this strategy worked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

99
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.920
<v Speaker 1>Firms like Intel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

100
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:21.754
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they chose Ireland as the place for </v>

101
00:05:22.961 --> 00:05:25.850
<v Speaker 1>their European headquarters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering why.</v>

102
00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This sounds great.</v>

103
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they essentially just opens up a tiny </v>

104
00:05:30.071 --> 00:05:30.904
<v Speaker 1>office with an accountant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that their contribution to </v>

105
00:05:33.041 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>the country's wealth was actually funny.</v>

106
00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.240
<v Speaker 2>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if</v>

107
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.083
<v Speaker 1>this was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same government that put the red </v>

108
00:05:40.501 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>carpet out the companies was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>raising income tax on it citizens.</v>

109
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Some people ended up paying 60 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in tax from their salaries,</v>

110
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:49.093
<v Speaker 1>and if this was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish legislation did not make it easy </v>

111
00:05:51.361 --> 00:05:53.790
<v Speaker 1>to hire people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now considering the situation,</v>

112
00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:56.580
<v Speaker 1>jobs are disappearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local companies are going bankrupt.</v>

113
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:57.443
<v Speaker 1>Government spending is on the rise and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of Irish people just leaving </v>

114
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1988,</v>

115
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>the Economist magazine published this.</v>

116
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:06.093
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

117
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.903
<v Speaker 1>of the rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poor Ireland behaved as though it was </v>

118
00:06:11.221 --> 00:06:13.740
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it must pay the price.</v>

119
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.341
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

120
00:06:14.341 --> 00:06:16.230
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's the bad stuff covered.</v>

121
00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they step out of the scenario?</v>

122
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you a story.</v>

123
00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.060
<v Speaker 1>The Celtic Tiger roars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the in 1987 and Charles Hall,</v>

124
00:06:32.061 --> 00:06:35.880
<v Speaker 1>he had won the elections in Ireland as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country on the edge of collapse.</v>

125
00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:36.773
<v Speaker 1>Mansi realized something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can't open your economic system </v>

126
00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.080
<v Speaker 1>without first modernizing it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course companies like oracle or HP,</v>

127
00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:43.943
<v Speaker 1>what happened to be an islands and pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>less taxes than they were paying in the </v>

128
00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but where are they willing to?</v>

129
00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:48.563
<v Speaker 1>I've been a research center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a factory that would employ a </v>

130
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:54.150
<v Speaker 1>thousand people we have who isn't and </v>
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>

131
00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first they would have to deal with the </v>

132
00:06:55.501 --> 00:06:57.990
<v Speaker 1>labor laws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were a bureaucratic nightmare.</v>

133
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:01.553
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you said about the 60 percent </v>

134
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:03.623
<v Speaker 1>income tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that no matter how high the </v>

135
00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:05.963
<v Speaker 1>salaries for the worker were,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fairly large chunk of that is still </v>

136
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:09.564
<v Speaker 1>going to the governor.</v>

137
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.410
<v Speaker 1>Highly skilled professionals would </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather just moved to the United States.</v>

138
00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:20.303
<v Speaker 1>So the first policy implemented by Jorge</v>
<v Speaker 1>was to deal with trade unions and the </v>

139
00:07:24.121 --> 00:07:24.954
<v Speaker 1>company's salaries would grow at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same rate as the economy was on the </v>

140
00:07:28.441 --> 00:07:30.600
<v Speaker 1>other hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lowered income taxes this way.</v>

141
00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>What has ended up making more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the wages were the same and this</v>

142
00:07:35.011 --> 00:07:35.844
<v Speaker 1>soon started generating right salts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Packard like slipped plant is to employ </v>

143
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:44.120
<v Speaker 1>2000 people by the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,000</v>

144
00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:45.013
<v Speaker 1>in a short amount of all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>multinational companies that it opens </v>

145
00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:48.313
<v Speaker 1>their fiscal headquarters on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish soil started owning that own </v>

146
00:07:51.420 --> 00:07:53.180
<v Speaker 1>factories and offices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

147
00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.540
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was going down,</v>

148
00:07:54.541 --> 00:07:57.390
<v Speaker 1>wages were on the rise and even the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government collected more money,</v>

149
00:07:57.410 --> 00:08:00.780
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this deal with the unions and theocratic</v>

150
00:08:00.781 --> 00:08:03.390
<v Speaker 1>simplification helped create all new </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

151
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever played with</v>

152
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 1>Ron at both the t shirt at prime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>arc drunk and Guinness?</v>

153
00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:14.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these companies expanded </v>

154
00:08:15.781 --> 00:08:20.310
<v Speaker 1>internationally during those years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why the Irish economy grew</v>

155
00:08:20.311 --> 00:08:21.144
<v Speaker 1>as much as the Chinese economy during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties suddenly addresses in </v>

156
00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:26.640
<v Speaker 1>Dublin would offer champagne to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>

157
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:29.760
<v Speaker 1>Some people even flying to New York to </v>
<v Speaker 1>do shopping on the weekends.</v>

158
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 1>These were the years of the Celtic Tiger</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at that point,</v>

159
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:37.670
<v Speaker 1>the economist decided to dedicate </v>
<v Speaker 1>another article a decade ago,</v>

160
00:08:38.701 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 1>Irish and comes with less than two </v>
<v Speaker 1>thirds of British incomes.</v>

161
00:08:41.880 --> 00:08:42.713
<v Speaker 1>Last year by one measure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had surpassed British incomes that </v>

162
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:48.990
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a moment because not </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is so perfect.</v>

163
00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:50.700
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during those 15 years,</v>

164
00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.563
<v Speaker 1>salaries doubles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that optimism drove banks to offer </v>

165
00:08:53.611 --> 00:08:54.444
<v Speaker 1>mortgages to nearly is encouraged,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous spending in those years were </v>

166
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v Speaker 1>even companies that rented helicopters </v>
<v Speaker 1>for children to have their first </v>

167
00:09:01.411 --> 00:09:02.390
<v Speaker 1>communion in the.</v>

168
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:03.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

169
00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:06.863
<v Speaker 1>and this led to a financial crisis that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to cover that in another </v>

<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

176
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:26.013
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the Irish model could </v>
<v Speaker 1>help other countries like Greece or </v>

177
00:09:28.391 --> 00:09:29.224
<v Speaker 1>perhaps India?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think poor countries could </v>

178
00:09:30.940 --> 00:09:33.370
<v Speaker 1>benefit from attracting foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments?</v>
