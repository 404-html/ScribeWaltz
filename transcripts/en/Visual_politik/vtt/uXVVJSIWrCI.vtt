1
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.333
<v Speaker 1>This is the only country along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece that is cora now than before </v>

2
00:00:11.541 --> 00:00:12.374
<v Speaker 1>having the euro as their official </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency to figures leave no space for </v>

3
00:00:15.861 --> 00:00:16.694
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italians now have less purchasing power </v>

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.513
<v Speaker 1>than before they joined the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes them one of the few </v>

5
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:24.460
<v Speaker 1>countries that became worse off after </v>
<v Speaker 1>joining the European.</v>

6
00:00:24.461 --> 00:00:25.294
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.560
<v Speaker 1>We also looking about the second biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial power in all of Europe,</v>

8
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:36.750
<v Speaker 1>which is only surpassed by Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

9
00:00:36.751 --> 00:00:37.584
<v Speaker 1>during the nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Italians were wealthier than the </v>

10
00:00:38.761 --> 00:00:39.930
<v Speaker 1>British and the French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

11
00:00:39.931 --> 00:00:42.730
<v Speaker 1>if you're my age or older,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might remember Ross Zazi,</v>

12
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Luciano Pavarotti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or these so called Spaghetti Westerns.</v>

13
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:47.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To view isn't.</v>

14
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:48.663
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the biggest powerhouses on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet and all the spine to their </v>

15
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:56.430
<v Speaker 1>governments and their ruling class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The political history of Italy is our.</v>

16
00:00:56.431 --> 00:00:57.264
<v Speaker 1>Should we say it well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say it makes game of thrones </v>

17
00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:04.431
<v Speaker 1>looked like the gilmore girls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

18
00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's Allianz Se Sicilian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cosa Nostra,</v>

19
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:10.480
<v Speaker 1>the Kalibrasi Drain Gretta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Napoleon Komora,</v>

20
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 1>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other gangs and yes,</v>

21
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:18.400
<v Speaker 1>all of them have important connections </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the highest levels of politicians,</v>

22
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.220
<v Speaker 1>but there's more than just a Nafisa </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

23
00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:22.143
<v Speaker 1>During the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some government officials held extreme </v>

24
00:01:24.101 --> 00:01:24.934
<v Speaker 1>right wing terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Groups that organize the most violence </v>

25
00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:27.794
<v Speaker 1>is acts that you could imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's not even talking about the </v>

26
00:01:29.771 --> 00:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>extreme left wing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which defines exactly stay quiet.</v>

27
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:36.610
<v Speaker 1>Either the Red Brigades kidnapped and </v>
<v Speaker 1>murdered an Italian pronunciation.</v>

28
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.613
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

29
00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.903
<v Speaker 1>if you're into scary stories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should google something about the </v>

30
00:01:42.711 --> 00:01:43.544
<v Speaker 1>propaganda duo more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can just watch the movie Il Divo </v>

31
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:46.844
<v Speaker 1>from Paolo Sorrentino.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will discover a fascinating country </v>

32
00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.400
<v Speaker 1>where politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anything was boring and now you might be</v>

33
00:01:52.401 --> 00:01:53.090
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

34
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is going on in Italy today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they have as much instability as they</v>

35
00:01:56.841 --> 00:01:59.150
<v Speaker 1>did in the 19 seventies in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties?</v>

36
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>And he also was absolutely in just 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

37
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.930
<v Speaker 1>If at six different prime ministers 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

38
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.853
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping up with Italian politics is </v>

39
00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:09.423
<v Speaker 1>pretty impossible mission and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>why in this video we're not actually </v>

40
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:12.794
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about the Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections that have been celebrated </v>

41
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:15.614
<v Speaker 1>recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even about Berlusconi's and love </v>

42
00:02:17.911 --> 00:02:19.070
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh no,</v>

43
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.053
<v Speaker 1>because the real question here is how is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it possible that such a chaotic country </v>

44
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.800
<v Speaker 1>could manage to become quite so wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what is happening now?</v>

45
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Often two decades of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>stagnation.</v>

46
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to answer both of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those questions,</v>

47
00:02:34.231 --> 00:02:36.870
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the good,</v>

48
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.840
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the ugly of Italian history.</v>

49
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:44.290
<v Speaker 3>Julio</v>

50
00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>and the reality is the good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the 1940 years,</v>

51
00:02:47.921 --> 00:02:48.754
<v Speaker 1>the Italian Communist Party was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest of its kind all across western </v>

52
00:02:52.361 --> 00:02:55.960
<v Speaker 1>Europe with more than one point 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million members.</v>

53
00:02:55.961 --> 00:02:58.330
<v Speaker 1>They could win an election anytime they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want it.</v>

54
00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the Cold War,</v>

55
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 1>this was something America could not </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>

56
00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.220
<v Speaker 1>So you remember the Marshall Plan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.070
<v Speaker 1>if you've been following visual politics</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

58
00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:12.610
<v Speaker 1>you already know that Uncle Sam sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of money to Europe so they</v>

59
00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:17.611
<v Speaker 1>can rebuild that destroyed city when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to you.</v>

60
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.900
<v Speaker 1>Isn't this money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was not an immense to help the country,</v>

61
00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.853
<v Speaker 1>but also to finance the only political </v>
<v Speaker 1>party you could face that communist </v>

62
00:03:26.491 --> 00:03:27.324
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This policy was called Christian </v>

63
00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:29.373
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother's save your children from </v>

64
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Bolshevism vote Christian democracy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next 50 years.</v>

65
00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.490
<v Speaker 1>It's an he had 30 different prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>ministers.</v>

66
00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.383
<v Speaker 1>This means that the average span of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian government was a little more </v>

67
00:03:45.241 --> 00:03:47.850
<v Speaker 1>than a year and a half,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all had something in common.</v>

68
00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.470
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were Christian.</v>

69
00:03:49.471 --> 00:03:50.304
<v Speaker 1>Democrat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governor within the Christian Democrats </v>

70
00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>is a man that you should know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name was Julio,</v>

71
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.684
<v Speaker 1>Andrea [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he became prime minister seven </v>

72
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.690
<v Speaker 1>different times and is the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>godfather of Christian democracy.</v>

73
00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:08.763
<v Speaker 1>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no Italian politician could do anything </v>

74
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.900
<v Speaker 1>without being.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last Minute Mrs Andreotti</v>

75
00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>power wears out those who don't have it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julio and royalty.</v>

76
00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>But now the obvious question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

77
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>what did the Christian Democrats stand </v>
<v Speaker 1>for?</v>

78
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christine Democracy was basically what </v>

79
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:28.354
<v Speaker 1>we call a catch up all party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone except communists could find his </v>

80
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:31.894
<v Speaker 1>or her place inside of this policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this included deals with Napoleon </v>

81
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>Kamora,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Sicilian Cosa Nostra,</v>

82
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.560
<v Speaker 1>and allegedly extreme right wing groups </v>
<v Speaker 1>that terrorize the country during the 19</v>

83
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:42.394
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about all of </v>

84
00:04:44.081 --> 00:04:44.914
<v Speaker 1>that in a future video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The important thing here is that </v>

85
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:48.513
<v Speaker 1>Andreotti and his Christian Democrats </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly needed popular support and you </v>

86
00:04:51.701 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to win some elections.</v>

87
00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Did you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's better than employing people with</v>

88
00:04:58.801 --> 00:05:00.060
<v Speaker 1>a good salary?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

89
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.953
<v Speaker 1>Italy has over three point $5 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>civil servants and they are among the </v>

90
00:05:03.421 --> 00:05:04.254
<v Speaker 1>highest paid in the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means a crazy public spending and </v>

91
00:05:06.961 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>lots of bureaucracy and toxins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

92
00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>Reality is time until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>easily is famous for two things.</v>

93
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.450
<v Speaker 1>Redstate and ineffective course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better understanding.</v>

94
00:05:17.451 --> 00:05:18.284
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine we have a company that </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces construction machines and we </v>

95
00:05:22.251 --> 00:05:24.890
<v Speaker 1>have clients who doesn't pay US </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally.</v>

96
00:05:24.891 --> 00:05:26.690
<v Speaker 1>We would probably want to take him to </v>
<v Speaker 1>court</v>

97
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 1>if we all in say France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This process could take around two and a</v>

98
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:33.964
<v Speaker 1>half months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the you could wait more than </v>

99
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.550
<v Speaker 1>three years before the problem gets </v>
<v Speaker 1>solved.</v>

100
00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:43.450
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not exactly the best of business</v>

101
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:44.770
<v Speaker 1>planets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nevertheless,</v>

102
00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:48.250
<v Speaker 1>I did say this sleep became one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthiest countries in all of Europe,</v>

103
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:50.140
<v Speaker 1>so how is that possible?</v>

104
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:54.090
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

105
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.923
<v Speaker 1>do you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the onset lies in the Italian </v>

106
00:05:56.461 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>lira?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

107
00:05:57.501 --> 00:05:59.570
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they had their own currency,</v>

108
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.404
<v Speaker 1>the Italian central bank could evaluate </v>
<v Speaker 1>their currency anytime they needed to </v>

109
00:06:03.621 --> 00:06:08.621
<v Speaker 1>put their economy on steroids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When now you might be wondering,</v>

110
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:10.851
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Simon,</v>

111
00:06:10.851 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 1>isn't that the worst thing that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do?</v>

112
00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in another video I told you that Germany</v>

113
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:18.860
<v Speaker 1>became rich partly because they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very stable currency,</v>

114
00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.370
<v Speaker 1>the deutschmark and now it seems that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm telling you the exact opposite.</v>

115
00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.233
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible to digitally could </v>

116
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.390
<v Speaker 1>grapes so much having so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>

117
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.350
<v Speaker 1>so much red tape,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's just constant evaluations.</v>

118
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:30.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's dive in.</v>

119
00:06:35.590 --> 00:06:37.390
<v Speaker 4>Freddy is the ugly,</v>

120
00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.900
<v Speaker 1>having exited more than 1700 movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rocco said Freddy.</v>

121
00:06:40.901 --> 00:06:43.720
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Italian stallion dominated the adult</v>

122
00:06:43.721 --> 00:06:46.840
<v Speaker 1>section of rental stores worldwide </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 19 eighties,</v>

123
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.763
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is also an interesting symbol of the </v>

124
00:06:52.571 --> 00:06:53.404
<v Speaker 1>Italian economy at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a growth model that relied heavily on </v>

125
00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.170
<v Speaker 1>inflation during the eighties and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

126
00:07:01.171 --> 00:07:03.600
<v Speaker 1>It's elite flooded the world with cheap </v>
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

127
00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:07.740
<v Speaker 1>They were a kind of 20th century China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as something works in some other</v>

128
00:07:07.741 --> 00:07:08.574
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Italian company would show up and </v>

129
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.300
<v Speaker 1>make the same thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do it cheaper.</v>

130
00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American movies in America,</v>

131
00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:18.090
<v Speaker 1>John Wayne Movies were incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful.</v>

132
00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:19.073
<v Speaker 1>Let's go to Debbie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was highly and movie producers </v>

133
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>started doing more of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the industrial level,</v>

134
00:07:24.990 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 1>and this is how the Spaghetti Western </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at the same time,</v>

135
00:07:29.871 --> 00:07:32.420
<v Speaker 1>the exact same thing was happening with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other industries.</v>

136
00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:33.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donna summer was making the entire </v>

137
00:07:34.251 --> 00:07:35.084
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan's Italian struck back with Sabrina </v>

138
00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:40.580
<v Speaker 1>who did the same but cheaper and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>explicitly.</v>

139
00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:41.873
<v Speaker 1>What about animated movies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Walt Disney was launching a landon in </v>

140
00:07:44.781 --> 00:07:45.614
<v Speaker 1>movie theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cheap Italian version was already </v>

141
00:07:47.571 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>available in all of the countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Video stores.</v>

142
00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:54.523
<v Speaker 1>That's innocently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were cheaply reproducing more than </v>

143
00:07:56.271 --> 00:07:57.104
<v Speaker 1>just culture in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian companies mastered the art of </v>

144
00:07:59.691 --> 00:08:02.600
<v Speaker 1>making cheap things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as economists would say,</v>

145
00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>low added value manufacturing isn't he </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced clothes,</v>

146
00:08:06.351 --> 00:08:08.540
<v Speaker 1>furniture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and plenty of plastic items.</v>

147
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:11.030
<v Speaker 1>If you bought an animated action figure </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the 19 nineties,</v>

148
00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:14.330
<v Speaker 1>it probably has a made in Italy label </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere bus.</v>

149
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.164
<v Speaker 1>If you bought a stereo sound system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have a made in Germany or made </v>

150
00:08:18.171 --> 00:08:20.660
<v Speaker 1>in Japan label and now the question </v>
<v Speaker 1>arises,</v>

151
00:08:20.661 --> 00:08:21.494
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was the Italian economy so strongly </v>

152
00:08:23.811 --> 00:08:26.030
<v Speaker 1>based on selling cheap things abroad?</v>

153
00:08:26.450 --> 00:08:26.770
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

154
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:27.603
<v Speaker 4>look at this chart,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you can see the value of the Italian </v>

155
00:08:29.321 --> 00:08:31.990
<v Speaker 4>lira against the German mark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you can see,</v>

156
00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:32.853
<v Speaker 4>during the eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Italian currency was losing value all </v>

157
00:08:35.351 --> 00:08:36.184
<v Speaker 4>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In 1980 you could get 450 liras for one </v>

158
00:08:41.021 --> 00:08:41.854
<v Speaker 4>German mark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Fifteen years later you get a thousand </v>

159
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 4>liras for one German mark.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So what does this mean?</v>

160
00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:50.080
<v Speaker 4>It means innovation was way more </v>
<v Speaker 4>expensive for Italian companies than for</v>

161
00:08:50.081 --> 00:08:50.914
<v Speaker 4>German ones.</v>

162
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:51.753
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine we have an Italian production </v>

163
00:08:53.261 --> 00:08:56.970
<v Speaker 1>company during the 19 eighties and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to a really innovative movie.</v>

164
00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:59.850
<v Speaker 1>Something like star wars with state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the art,</v>

165
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:02.890
<v Speaker 1>special effects and cutting edge </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology if we want to do that,</v>

166
00:09:02.891 --> 00:09:03.724
<v Speaker 1>so we need to buy animation software </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's produced in Japan and special </v>

167
00:09:06.241 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>cameras from America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since our Italian currency is losing</v>

168
00:09:09.780 --> 00:09:10.613
<v Speaker 1>value all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those things are more expensive for us </v>

169
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>and to answer this that anytime we need </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hire someone new,</v>

170
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>we're having to cut through never ending</v>
<v Speaker 1>red tape,</v>

171
00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.670
<v Speaker 1>so suddenly not salmon is a good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it?</v>

172
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:20.703
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

173
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:25.860
<v Speaker 1>but now imagine that instead of making a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stall was like film.</v>

174
00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>We call our friend Rocco's Freddy and we</v>
<v Speaker 1>make an adult movie with him.</v>

175
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:31.410
<v Speaker 1>We just need a couple of cameras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remanned a bet,</v>

176
00:09:31.590 --> 00:09:35.790
<v Speaker 1>and since we have a weak currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can sell on movies abroad for a lower</v>

177
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:38.820
<v Speaker 1>price than any other film.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So simply following this model,</v>

178
00:09:38.821 --> 00:09:41.370
<v Speaker 1>the Italian economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it grew sky high.</v>

179
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.323
<v Speaker 1>During these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of smaller companies were </v>

180
00:09:49.981 --> 00:09:51.570
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake here,</v>

181
00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:54.690
<v Speaker 1>Italian smes have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>German smes.</v>

182
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.643
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>German middle stands had between 50 and </v>

183
00:09:57.781 --> 00:10:02.781
<v Speaker 1>200 workers and they had enough scale to</v>
<v Speaker 1>invest money on research and innovation.</v>

184
00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:03.773
<v Speaker 1>Italian companies were way smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods were more traditional and their </v>

185
00:10:06.751 --> 00:10:07.584
<v Speaker 1>industries where well more in Italy </v>
<v Speaker 1>started taking account of its shadow </v>

186
00:10:14.071 --> 00:10:17.130
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>found that it made up a fifth of Italian</v>

187
00:10:17.131 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 1>GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

188
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.510
<v Speaker 1>the economy grew by 18 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight,</v>

189
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.593
<v Speaker 1>so now you might wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should Italians innovate so much if </v>

190
00:10:25.331 --> 00:10:28.240
<v Speaker 1>they were doing so well by not doing it </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

191
00:10:28.510 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to tell you why Silvio </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlusconi is the ugly.</v>

192
00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finally,</v>

193
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:37.880
<v Speaker 1>the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Christine Democracy,</v>

194
00:10:37.910 --> 00:10:41.480
<v Speaker 1>not really that important anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the brand new leader of the center,</v>

195
00:10:41.481 --> 00:10:44.120
<v Speaker 1>right wing is the man you see on screen </v>
<v Speaker 1>now and yes,</v>

196
00:10:44.121 --> 00:10:46.880
<v Speaker 1>you might know that his name is Silvio </v>
<v Speaker 1>Berlusconi</v>

197
00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:53.410
<v Speaker 1>little hair because my brain is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it pushes everything else out.</v>

198
00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:54.603
<v Speaker 1>Suvio Berlusconi thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was not the best year to the Italian </v>

199
00:10:58.030 --> 00:10:58.863
<v Speaker 1>prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know why?</v>

200
00:10:59.080 --> 00:10:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because 2002 was the Italy abandons the </v>

201
00:11:02.261 --> 00:11:03.094
<v Speaker 1>Italian lira and started using the euro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's the main characteristic of </v>

202
00:11:06.761 --> 00:11:07.690
<v Speaker 1>the euro?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

203
00:11:07.750 --> 00:11:08.583
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments can decide by itself when </v>

204
00:11:10.661 --> 00:11:11.494
<v Speaker 1>they devalue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's yours are issued by the European </v>

205
00:11:14.170 --> 00:11:15.003
<v Speaker 1>Central Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes representatives of all </v>

206
00:11:16.151 --> 00:11:16.984
<v Speaker 1>the member countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a big problem for a country </v>

207
00:11:18.671 --> 00:11:19.504
<v Speaker 1>like Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had become so addicted to </v>

208
00:11:20.621 --> 00:11:23.020
<v Speaker 1>devaluation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things don't stop there.</v>

209
00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:23.943
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you remember another thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens at the beginning of the two </v>

210
00:11:26.531 --> 00:11:28.000
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't say,</v>

211
00:11:28.030 --> 00:11:28.863
<v Speaker 1>well let me refresh your memory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joins the World Trade Organization at </v>

212
00:11:34.271 --> 00:11:36.010
<v Speaker 1>last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so now you might be wondering,</v>

213
00:11:36.011 --> 00:11:36.844
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does China have to do with the Italian </v>

214
00:11:38.321 --> 00:11:39.190
<v Speaker 1>economy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

215
00:11:39.191 --> 00:11:43.390
<v Speaker 1>as you might guess rather lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that China had joined the World</v>

216
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:45.940
<v Speaker 1>Trade Organization was a symptom of </v>
<v Speaker 1>something much bigger as men's.</v>

217
00:11:45.941 --> 00:11:46.774
<v Speaker 1>All of Asia was flooding the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international markets and it was not </v>

218
00:11:48.821 --> 00:11:49.654
<v Speaker 1>only China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other countries like Thailand and </v>

219
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh were already becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing powerhouses.</v>

220
00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.073
<v Speaker 1>And surprise surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did these countries start </v>

221
00:11:58.091 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing first?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

222
00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:01.690
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very cheap things.</v>

223
00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Same as the Italians buts even cheaper.</v>

224
00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:08.853
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Germany was already off technology </v>

225
00:12:11.121 --> 00:12:11.954
<v Speaker 1>wise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So despite the Asian competition that </v>

226
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:15.160
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were still competitive.</v>

227
00:12:15.190 --> 00:12:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile isn't he could not go back to </v>
<v Speaker 1>old school devaluation first,</v>

228
00:12:19.141 --> 00:12:19.974
<v Speaker 1>they were now part of the euro and </v>
<v Speaker 1>second devaluing wasn't a solution </v>

229
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:25.810
<v Speaker 1>against Asia's cheap salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's an example.</v>

230
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:28.450
<v Speaker 1>One of the most symbolic Italian </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies is Fiat.</v>

231
00:12:28.570 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 1>In 1998,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sold over one point $3 million cars</v>

232
00:12:31.841 --> 00:12:34.260
<v Speaker 1>in your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they only sell 700,000</v>

233
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 1>and they can't get into new markets.</v>

234
00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:46.500
<v Speaker 1>Other brands like BMW still maintain </v>
<v Speaker 1>their share on their traditional markets</v>

235
00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 1>and also they're growing and emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like China,</v>

236
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:51.060
<v Speaker 1>but just,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

237
00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:53.430
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute here because we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>done yet.</v>

238
00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:56.900
<v Speaker 1>You really know how it's has over 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million civil servants.</v>

239
00:12:56.970 --> 00:12:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all still there and they still have</v>

240
00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:00.930
<v Speaker 1>to be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

241
00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:01.764
<v Speaker 1>while the Italian economy is falling and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government is collecting fewer and </v>

242
00:13:03.901 --> 00:13:04.734
<v Speaker 1>fewer taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all still spending the same amount </v>

243
00:13:07.291 --> 00:13:08.060
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what?</v>

244
00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:08.893
<v Speaker 1>What does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means essentially is now the fourth </v>

245
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:11.693
<v Speaker 1>most indebted country on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're public debt is over 130 percent </v>

246
00:13:15.871 --> 00:13:19.500
<v Speaker 1>of their GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this certificate is simply crazy.</v>

247
00:13:22.850 --> 00:13:23.920
<v Speaker 1>Is Europe's next big?</v>

248
00:13:26.830 --> 00:13:27.663
<v Speaker 1>So now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should Italy abandon the euro so that </v>

249
00:13:30.971 --> 00:13:34.990
<v Speaker 1>they can go back to that devaluation </v>
<v Speaker 1>methods and cheap manufacturing?</v>

250
00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:36.513
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they should follow the German </v>
<v Speaker 1>model and let their companies innovate </v>

251
00:13:38.951 --> 00:13:39.784
<v Speaker 1>more while I've said my piece.</v>
