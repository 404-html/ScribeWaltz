1
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.373
<v Speaker 1>I want to start with a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you do if you had </v>

2
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:13.930
<v Speaker 1>$250,000,000,000,000?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are many things you would</v>

3
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:14.764
<v Speaker 1>do with that sort of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if I told you those </v>

4
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.790
<v Speaker 1>$250,000,000,000,000 worth from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe?</v>

5
00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:19.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a totally different question </v>

6
00:00:20.711 --> 00:00:21.544
<v Speaker 1>because in 2015 and 250 trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe and dollars were worth the </v>

7
00:00:25.811 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of one us scholar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

8
00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.400
<v Speaker 1>You heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely right.</v>

9
00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.550
<v Speaker 1>The truth is the Zimbabwe is like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

10
00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.620
<v Speaker 1>but on a massive scale,</v>

11
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>this country has suffered the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation of all time.</v>

12
00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.943
<v Speaker 1>Since more or less than year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 prices were rising higher and </v>

13
00:00:47.921 --> 00:00:50.920
<v Speaker 1>higher as an absolutely mind boggling </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>

14
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:51.813
<v Speaker 1>In 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a piece of bread was worth 10,000 </v>

15
00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:56.410
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwean dollars and name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you wondering,</v>

16
00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did it all of this happened?</v>

17
00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.740
<v Speaker 1>Now the answer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty simple.</v>

18
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.010
<v Speaker 1>One day he told his finance minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

19
00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 1>I don't care how you do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but man,</v>

20
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.390
<v Speaker 1>we need money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did the finance minister today?</v>

21
00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.363
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he just pressed the money printing </v>

22
00:01:10.511 --> 00:01:13.840
<v Speaker 1>button like there was no tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in conclusion,</v>

23
00:01:13.841 --> 00:01:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe had to get rid of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>national currency and led to the economy</v>

24
00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>be dominated by foreign currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the American dollar.</v>

25
00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:27.363
<v Speaker 1>All of this was a little while ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is going on in Zimbabwe </v>

26
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:30.820
<v Speaker 1>now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:33.460
<v Speaker 1>in recent days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're recording this in 2017,</v>

28
00:01:33.461 --> 00:01:34.294
<v Speaker 1>the country appeared on the news because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Acute Atar that spells the end of </v>

29
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.750
<v Speaker 1>mcgarvey 37 year long dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

30
00:01:40.751 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>my difference of visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must say that Cuda tiles are not what</v>

31
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:45.544
<v Speaker 1>they used to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was what we could call the direct </v>

32
00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.210
<v Speaker 1>version of acute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>

33
00:01:48.211 --> 00:01:49.300
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have a look at.</v>

34
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.183
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

35
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.863
<v Speaker 1>bobby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get $10,000,000 payoff and immunity </v>

36
00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.220
<v Speaker 1>for his family and this sort of thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>better described as a soap opera.</v>

37
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.143
<v Speaker 1>Regard it as 93 years old wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dominion power and he also wanted his </v>

38
00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.460
<v Speaker 1>wife who's 52 years old to inherit the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency.</v>

39
00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.323
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of thing that can only happen </v>

40
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:11.734
<v Speaker 1>in countries like Argentina and North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea or perhaps the national front in </v>

41
00:02:14.591 --> 00:02:16.600
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you can imagine,</v>

42
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.434
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people did not agree with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the IRB clans sent all of them and </v>

43
00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.543
<v Speaker 1>physical opponents out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happened in the beginning </v>

44
00:02:23.921 --> 00:02:24.754
<v Speaker 1>of November 2017 when they kicked out </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vice presidents and this guy has a </v>

45
00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>really difficult to pronounce his name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I looked it up.</v>

46
00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.470
<v Speaker 1>I still can't pronounce it properly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but his name is Emerson Minim,</v>

47
00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>Guam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

48
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>sorry if I butcher the pronunciation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his name in this one,</v>

49
00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 1>the army's reaction to this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>immediate and well,</v>

50
00:02:43.721 --> 00:02:44.554
<v Speaker 1>you probably know the rest of the story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now the is about Zimbabwe's future </v>

51
00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.253
<v Speaker 1>of many is managua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new mcgarvey is this man Abel to </v>

52
00:02:51.371 --> 00:02:52.510
<v Speaker 1>resurrect Zimbabwe's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

53
00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

54
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>we are going to answer those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do.</v>

55
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look back at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousand defect.</v>

56
00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.463
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you Zimbabwe's economy is a total </v>

57
00:03:10.721 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>

58
00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.780
<v Speaker 1>If you make a cocktail where you mix </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship and Africa,</v>

59
00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.470
<v Speaker 1>what you guess is corruption and policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

60
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:20.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

61
00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:24.323
<v Speaker 1>kinds of right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but probably not as much as you might </v>

62
00:03:25.621 --> 00:03:26.371
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

63
00:03:26.371 --> 00:03:27.204
<v Speaker 1>there was a time where Zimbabwe was </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the African Jew that that's </v>

64
00:03:29.701 --> 00:03:30.534
<v Speaker 1>also allowed this country to become was </v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole continents bond and now you </v>

65
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:33.751
<v Speaker 1>might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

66
00:03:33.751 --> 00:03:36.000
<v Speaker 1>what happens when a country with so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources,</v>

67
00:03:36.001 --> 00:03:38.010
<v Speaker 1>so many rich lands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many gold mines.</v>

68
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.680
<v Speaker 1>What caused it to become such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe?</v>

69
00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.491
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we owned that.</v>

70
00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:44.280
<v Speaker 1>It definitely has a name and that name </v>
<v Speaker 1>is Robert Magaldi.</v>

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe has been an independent country</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some 37 years.</v>

72
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Thirty seven years is the amount of time</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Gabi has been empowered.</v>

73
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.170
<v Speaker 1>The decolonial colonialization process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the so called itself Rhodesia British</v>

74
00:03:55.171 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that in a 15 years old</v>

75
00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.960
<v Speaker 2>for war</v>

76
00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:03.183
<v Speaker 1>I'm hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we had the white minority that made up </v>

77
00:04:04.531 --> 00:04:07.360
<v Speaker 1>just five percent of the population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite what you might think.</v>

78
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.970
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have the support of western </v>
<v Speaker 1>powers.</v>

79
00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:10.923
<v Speaker 1>They declared their independence </v>
<v Speaker 1>unilaterally and therefore no other </v>

80
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:14.920
<v Speaker 1>countries supported them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

81
00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.360
<v Speaker 1>you have the guerrilla troops led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robin [inaudible],</v>

82
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.333
<v Speaker 1>the man who combined anti imperialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism with a hardcore communist </v>

83
00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.050
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

84
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.913
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might now be thinking cold war </v>

85
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.943
<v Speaker 1>plastic communist leader plus longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds like a pretty explosive </v>

86
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.210
<v Speaker 1>combination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

87
00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

88
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.760
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely wrong.</v>

89
00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:40.653
<v Speaker 1>Back then the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his priority was to let that former </v>

90
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:43.084
<v Speaker 1>colonies become healthy democracies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why I thought Joe has self </v>

91
00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:46.983
<v Speaker 1>signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peace agreements with the Zimbabwe </v>

92
00:04:48.081 --> 00:04:50.980
<v Speaker 1>and guerrilla fighters and organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections in the country.</v>

93
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.370
<v Speaker 1>These elections were as fast as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be given that the country had just</v>

94
00:04:54.371 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 1>ended a civil war and had good real </v>
<v Speaker 1>warriors all over the place.</v>

95
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.050
<v Speaker 1>Who won the election?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:01.720
<v Speaker 1>of course it's rather than Garvey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

97
00:05:01.721 --> 00:05:02.554
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did macaby cheats in the selection or </v>

98
00:05:03.611 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>was it a fair victory?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:07.180
<v Speaker 1>the evidence actually suggests that yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had the support in.</v>

100
00:05:07.181 --> 00:05:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did genuinely</v>

101
00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.950
<v Speaker 1>see among the majority of the black </v>
<v Speaker 1>population in Zimbabwe,</v>

102
00:05:17.951 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 1>there are two major ethnic groups who </v>
<v Speaker 1>make up 80 percent of the population.</v>

103
00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.440
<v Speaker 1>And then you have the mat of billy who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had just 10 percent rather than the Gabi</v>

104
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>belongs to the owner group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why it's no surprise that he</v>

105
00:05:29.351 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>wants 60 percent of the votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 1980,</v>

106
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:32.614
<v Speaker 1>the UK granted independence to Rhodesia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is how Zimbabwe became a </v>

107
00:05:36.131 --> 00:05:41.110
<v Speaker 1>sovereign country with new Gabi as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents during the first seven years,</v>

108
00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>he basically grabbed all of the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in terms of the economy,</v>

109
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:47.030
<v Speaker 1>at least we've got to admit that things </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually work.</v>

110
00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:47.893
<v Speaker 1>So</v>

111
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 2>in the beginning they'll be</v>

112
00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:57.860
<v Speaker 1>respected the property rights of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>white population,</v>

113
00:05:57.890 --> 00:05:58.723
<v Speaker 1>both in a very Venezuelan fashion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He spends all of the savings from the </v>

114
00:06:01.401 --> 00:06:04.940
<v Speaker 1>colonial times where we have to admit </v>
<v Speaker 1>that although it didn't work in the long</v>

115
00:06:04.941 --> 00:06:05.774
<v Speaker 1>run regarding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did achieve a greater goal and his role </v>

116
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:10.550
<v Speaker 1>is in Bob way achieved the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>literacy rate in Africa.</v>

117
00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of Zimbabweans can read </v>
<v Speaker 1>and write.</v>

118
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>So if you've got your dictatorial to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>list in front of you,</v>

119
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:17.160
<v Speaker 1>well what's the next thing on that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.650
<v Speaker 1>that's to get rid of the opposition in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this chapter of his life.</v>

121
00:06:20.651 --> 00:06:21.484
<v Speaker 1>He did not save a penny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sends the fifth garrison of his army </v>

122
00:06:24.011 --> 00:06:24.844
<v Speaker 1>to North Korea so that he could learn </v>
<v Speaker 1>about state of the art methods for </v>

123
00:06:27.461 --> 00:06:32.461
<v Speaker 1>oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and when those soldiers came back,</v>

124
00:06:34.921 --> 00:06:36.750
<v Speaker 1>he pretty much said to them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>alright guys,</v>

125
00:06:36.751 --> 00:06:38.790
<v Speaker 1>now go get rid of these now to bally's </v>
<v Speaker 1>wiped them out.</v>

126
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:39.723
<v Speaker 1>This is how the [inaudible] started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greco Hindi means in the language early </v>

127
00:06:43.531 --> 00:06:44.364
<v Speaker 1>rain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cleans the straws by the inside </v>

128
00:06:45.541 --> 00:06:47.610
<v Speaker 1>before the spring rain comes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

129
00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.730
<v Speaker 1>Shown as they are pretty poetic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the printed name.</v>

130
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:54.520
<v Speaker 1>This was an ethnic cleansing that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>done pretty much as the manual describes</v>

131
00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.940
<v Speaker 1>and the more than 20,000 people died,</v>

132
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:05.420
<v Speaker 1>and with this regarding gained a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal of political stability.</v>

133
00:07:05.421 --> 00:07:07.430
<v Speaker 1>Forehead killed all of his political </v>
<v Speaker 1>foes.</v>

134
00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:10.670
<v Speaker 1>That's in the year 2000 things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They really changed,</v>

135
00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:13.970
<v Speaker 1>not yet decided to start an agricultural</v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>

136
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:14.804
<v Speaker 1>And the style of Chairman Mao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a real revolution and everything </v>

137
00:07:18.411 --> 00:07:19.244
<v Speaker 1>changed for the West.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gabi decided that the best lands </v>

138
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:24.260
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be owned by the white </v>
<v Speaker 1>minority.</v>

139
00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>So we,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he expropriated that land and gave it to</v>

140
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>surprise surprise his ministers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political allies.</v>

141
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he only gave them the lines he could not</v>

142
00:07:32.991 --> 00:07:34.420
<v Speaker 1>give them the knowledge to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tends it,</v>

143
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>so production fell sharply while </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation destroyed the rest of the</v>

144
00:07:38.601 --> 00:07:39.830
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

145
00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:42.440
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe has pretty much been a living </v>
<v Speaker 1>hell.</v>

146
00:07:45.930 --> 00:07:46.763
<v Speaker 1>Time of the crocodiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crocodiles wait beneath the water just </v>

147
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:53.080
<v Speaker 1>showing their eyes and their nostrils </v>
<v Speaker 1>until the victim appears.</v>

148
00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>Then they open their doors and they eat </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

149
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>This is why the new president of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zimbabwe,</v>

150
00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.143
<v Speaker 1>men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angola,</v>

151
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:00.183
<v Speaker 1>is known as the Crocodile Mountain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Galois was one of those leaders during </v>

152
00:08:03.911 --> 00:08:07.190
<v Speaker 1>the civil war and he has been a minister</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1980,</v>

153
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.780
<v Speaker 1>so he spent all of his life waiting </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the shadow of the dictator.</v>

154
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:14.370
<v Speaker 1>That moment has finally come so far </v>
<v Speaker 1>after this cue,</v>

155
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.450
<v Speaker 1>his first steps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been very risky.</v>

156
00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Here is an example,</v>

157
00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Bob Wade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders cabinet heavy on military ruling</v>

158
00:08:24.981 --> 00:08:27.130
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not enough as in Bob Way and</v>

159
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:29.870
<v Speaker 1>he still has a lot of work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has been one of the biggest steps,</v>

160
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:30.980
<v Speaker 1>has already been taken</v>

161
00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:34.353
<v Speaker 1>government a bent in digitization law </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the indigenization law is another </v>

162
00:08:38.231 --> 00:08:41.170
<v Speaker 1>economic policy made by Magog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

163
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.780
<v Speaker 1>he said bigger companies couldn't belong</v>
<v Speaker 1>to white people.</v>

164
00:08:43.900 --> 00:08:44.733
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white minority that used to live in </v>

165
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:47.194
<v Speaker 1>the country has already integrated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They used to be five percent of the </v>

166
00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are now just one set,</v>

167
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>but now the crocodile wants foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments and rejecting because of his</v>

168
00:08:56.170 --> 00:08:57.003
<v Speaker 1>race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem like a brilliant economic </v>

169
00:08:58.471 --> 00:09:03.471
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait just a minute,</v>

170
00:09:04.071 --> 00:09:04.904
<v Speaker 1>because despite all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the new president of Zimbabwe might </v>

171
00:09:07.630 --> 00:09:10.270
<v Speaker 1>not be the right man for the job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a country like this,</v>

172
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.133
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to find dark spots on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician who served such a crazy </v>

173
00:09:14.561 --> 00:09:15.394
<v Speaker 1>dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And guess what crocodile did in the 19 </v>

174
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:18.544
<v Speaker 1>eighties?</v>

175
00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

176
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:25.060
<v Speaker 1>He was the minister of national </v>
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>

177
00:09:25.120 --> 00:09:25.953
<v Speaker 1>So he would have had something to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with that genocide that we mentioned </v>

178
00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:29.193
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and being the person who executed the </v>

179
00:09:30.971 --> 00:09:34.990
<v Speaker 1>genocide doesn't exactly make you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime person to run a country.</v>

180
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:35.883
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that probably pops into your mind right </v>

181
00:09:36.911 --> 00:09:40.600
<v Speaker 1>now is really someone who can become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>true opposition to this regime,</v>

182
00:09:40.810 --> 00:09:43.480
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is absolutely yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2008,</v>

183
00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:46.780
<v Speaker 1>there was a political party called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Movement for Democratic Change,</v>

184
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.810
<v Speaker 1>and surprisingly they beat me in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

185
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:51.370
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you totally had that.</v>

186
00:09:51.371 --> 00:09:53.620
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in a dictatorship like Zimbabwe,</v>

187
00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:54.483
<v Speaker 1>this meant a big time political crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've all been simply couldn't </v>

188
00:09:57.611 --> 00:10:00.220
<v Speaker 1>destroy a political opponents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had such political capital.</v>

189
00:10:05.890 --> 00:10:08.700
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also couldn't let him win and finally</v>

190
00:10:08.710 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 1>regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he came up with a solution.</v>

191
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:12.850
<v Speaker 1>He would remain the presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he would let his opponents,</v>

192
00:10:12.851 --> 00:10:13.990
<v Speaker 1>Morgan Stanley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

193
00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:15.700
<v Speaker 1>They come to the prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

194
00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:18.190
<v Speaker 1>this prime minister remained in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just four years,</v>

195
00:10:18.191 --> 00:10:21.880
<v Speaker 1>and during those four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Bob way started using the US dollar</v>

196
00:10:21.881 --> 00:10:25.120
<v Speaker 1>as an official currency after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse of that local one,</v>

197
00:10:25.210 --> 00:10:28.030
<v Speaker 1>but becomes free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It still remains in dire straits</v>

198
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment rate at 90 percent.</v>

199
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.263
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's finger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan has lost a lot of political </v>

200
00:10:37.981 --> 00:10:38.814
<v Speaker 1>capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it does seem that in the next </v>

201
00:10:39.931 --> 00:10:40.764
<v Speaker 1>election the crocodile has all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chances to win besides the army is also </v>

202
00:10:44.281 --> 00:10:46.810
<v Speaker 1>going to control the process and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>army sports,</v>

203
00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:47.663
<v Speaker 1>the crocodile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing must be sad here and that is </v>

204
00:10:49.111 --> 00:10:49.944
<v Speaker 1>whoever leads this country next,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have a great advantage for it is </v>

205
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:56.000
<v Speaker 1>impossible to do a worse job than their </v>
<v Speaker 1>predecessors.</v>

206
00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:03.713
<v Speaker 1>So now the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think the crocodile will be able </v>

207
00:11:05.971 --> 00:11:09.720
<v Speaker 1>to take Zimbabwe back and make it an </v>
<v Speaker 1>African jewel once again,</v>

208
00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:12.120
<v Speaker 1>or do you think he's going to turn into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next Mugabi?</v>

209
00:11:12.150 --> 00:11:12.983
