<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.853
<v Speaker 2>on the 1st of July,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visio Canada celebrated it's 150th </v>

3
00:00:12.101 --> 00:00:12.934
<v Speaker 2>birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we told you all about this in a </v>

4
00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 2>previous video where we also showed you </v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the keys as Dwight Canada is one</v>

5
00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:21.060
<v Speaker 2>of the most admired countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire wells,</v>

6
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:21.943
<v Speaker 2>kinda instability to into 10 provinces </v>
<v Speaker 2>and three territories just have so many </v>

7
00:00:25.601 --> 00:00:26.434
<v Speaker 2>unique regulations that in 2017 they </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually had to sign a free trade </v>

8
00:00:29.891 --> 00:00:31.330
<v Speaker 2>agreement among them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

9
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.570
<v Speaker 2>even though this country is turns 150 in</v>
<v Speaker 2>perfect shape,</v>

10
00:00:34.571 --> 00:00:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Canada is also facing problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Faye,</v>

11
00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.923
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>
<v Speaker 2>political and economic threats that </v>

12
00:00:39.491 --> 00:00:41.020
<v Speaker 2>could be considered.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

13
00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.650
<v Speaker 2>pretty serious indeed because as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably already know,</v>

14
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.290
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately nothing is perfect.</v>

15
00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.153
<v Speaker 2>So in a previous video who's link I'll </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave at the end of this video as well </v>

16
00:00:50.771 --> 00:00:51.604
<v Speaker 2>as in the description below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We looked on the bright side of things </v>

17
00:00:54.461 --> 00:00:57.400
<v Speaker 2>and Canada ended up looking pretty darn </v>
<v Speaker 2>wonderful.</v>

18
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.383
<v Speaker 2>But in this video we're going to discuss</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main problems and threats that are </v>

19
00:01:01.451 --> 00:01:03.850
<v Speaker 2>affecting Canada and well the first of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>

20
00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 2>it's got a lot to do with this 150th </v>
<v Speaker 2>anniversary birthday.</v>

21
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:18.611
<v Speaker 2>Somehow artificial Canadians not even </v>
<v Speaker 2>close,</v>

22
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.053
<v Speaker 2>celebrated this 150th birthday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can find several different reasons </v>

23
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 2>why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in order to explain them,</v>

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 2>we should first tell you about what </v>
<v Speaker 2>happens 150 years ago,</v>

25
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:31.493
<v Speaker 2>so that's jumped back in time all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>way to 1867 on the 1st of July of that </v>

26
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.404
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The territory was still a part of the </v>

27
00:01:38.671 --> 00:01:39.504
<v Speaker 2>British empire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was on this day for the first </v>

28
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 2>British North America Act was signed.</v>

29
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:50.830
<v Speaker 2>The British North America Act of 1867 </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a law that united the three colonial</v>

30
00:01:50.831 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 2>provinces of New Brunswick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new Scotland and Canada,</v>

31
00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.470
<v Speaker 2>which is divided up into Ontario and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Quebec.</v>

32
00:01:56.471 --> 00:01:57.304
<v Speaker 2>That very same day into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Confederation of Canada of these four </v>

33
00:02:02.571 --> 00:02:03.404
<v Speaker 2>provinces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which still counts quite a loss of </v>

34
00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:07.010
<v Speaker 2>autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A federal government was organized to to</v>

35
00:02:07.011 --> 00:02:10.220
<v Speaker 2>give them some cohesion above this </v>
<v Speaker 2>government's,</v>

36
00:02:10.221 --> 00:02:15.221
<v Speaker 2>there was still the British authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to this day,</v>

37
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 2>Canada is still a monarchy and Queen </v>
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth.</v>

38
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.600
<v Speaker 2>The second is still the head of state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also Bams,</v>

39
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:22.434
<v Speaker 2>although it might sound surprising,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada didn't have to till independence </v>

40
00:02:24.781 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 2>from the UK until very recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>1982 in fact,</v>

41
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.333
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something's on 1982 any constitutional </v>

42
00:02:31.081 --> 00:02:34.440
<v Speaker 2>modification required to the approval of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the British parliament.</v>

43
00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.873
<v Speaker 2>So as you can probably see from this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that law in 1867 it didn't result in a </v>

44
00:02:40.091 --> 00:02:43.130
<v Speaker 2>completely independent country bus Dev </v>
<v Speaker 2>you is.</v>

45
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.283
<v Speaker 2>That's not the ends of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are more reasons why Canadians </v>

46
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:51.160
<v Speaker 2>dislike this day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most important of these is that when</v>

47
00:02:51.161 --> 00:02:52.780
<v Speaker 2>the settlers arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

48
00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an empty lands</v>

49
00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.320
<v Speaker 3>first nations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the inuits and the,</v>

50
00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:04.243
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

51
00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.120
<v Speaker 2>it's 1.5 million inhabitants said </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing to celebrate last July and those</v>

52
00:03:11.121 --> 00:03:13.820
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants my own v within natives of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>

53
00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.100
<v Speaker 2>it's a celebration of the worst 150 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years up indigenous peoples lives.</v>

54
00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.760
<v Speaker 2>Don't think of this as only a historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

55
00:03:22.761 --> 00:03:24.920
<v Speaker 2>The recognition and integration of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>people's,</v>

56
00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:28.250
<v Speaker 2>it continues to this day to be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>national problem.</v>

57
00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.230
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government of Justin Trudeau,</v>

58
00:03:30.231 --> 00:03:31.064
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't made it a priority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consider all the prime minister had to </v>

59
00:03:33.021 --> 00:03:33.854
<v Speaker 2>say on the 21st of June of this year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No relationship is more important to </v>

60
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:38.744
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then the relationship with the </v>

61
00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 2>indigenous peoples,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau.</v>

62
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering,</v>

63
00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these groups sounds,</v>

64
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.200
<v Speaker 2>what has happened to them over the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>150 years?</v>

65
00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.623
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

66
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:56.190
<v Speaker 3>According to the Canadian constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there were three large groups.</v>

67
00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.490
<v Speaker 3>The first nations made of more than 600 </v>
<v Speaker 3>native communities.</v>

68
00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.343
<v Speaker 3>The inuits,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people of the Arctic and the </v>

69
00:04:03.211 --> 00:04:04.044
<v Speaker 3>methods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the result of mixing natives with the </v>

70
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:06.444
<v Speaker 3>new settlers.</v>

71
00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.900
<v Speaker 2>Canada was not an empty land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When the settlers arrived,</v>

72
00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:11.734
<v Speaker 2>it's actually estimated that there were </v>
<v Speaker 2>around 500,000 people from these needs </v>

73
00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:15.454
<v Speaker 2>of communities who signed the agreements</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the British and the French </v>

74
00:04:18.041 --> 00:04:18.874
<v Speaker 2>authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even participated in the battles </v>

75
00:04:20.741 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 2>that protected the independence of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

76
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.273
<v Speaker 2>Canada would be American today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not for the Indian allies who fought </v>

77
00:04:27.221 --> 00:04:28.600
<v Speaker 2>for the crown.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Peter Russell.</v>

78
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:29.523
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The U s really did try to invade Canada </v>

79
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:32.860
<v Speaker 2>more than once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While.</v>

80
00:04:32.861 --> 00:04:33.694
<v Speaker 2>The problem is that despite his being </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first people in this land and </v>

81
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:36.184
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that they participated </v>
<v Speaker 2>and contributed to the independence of </v>

82
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.114
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the natives suffered a clear cultural </v>

83
00:04:42.251 --> 00:04:42.890
<v Speaker 2>pass,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a key.</v>

84
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:43.723
<v Speaker 1>Oh Shit.</v>

85
00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.450
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a result of that obsession,</v>

86
00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:51.303
<v Speaker 2>somehow to create a homogenous and </v>
<v Speaker 2>national identities kind of just went </v>

87
00:04:53.711 --> 00:04:56.560
<v Speaker 2>through a period of persecuting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>natives.</v>

88
00:04:56.561 --> 00:04:57.394
<v Speaker 2>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these people suffered the occupation of </v>

89
00:04:58.901 --> 00:05:01.240
<v Speaker 2>their territories and were sent away to </v>
<v Speaker 2>reservations,</v>

90
00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.103
<v Speaker 2>which sometimes didn't even have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>basic conditions that would allow for </v>

91
00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 2>their survival.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>

92
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.054
<v Speaker 2>both their language and their cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>and religious rituals where sometimes </v>

93
00:05:09.881 --> 00:05:10.714
<v Speaker 2>forbidden this persecution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it reached such a point that the </v>

94
00:05:12.761 --> 00:05:17.380
<v Speaker 2>authority set up a system of residences </v>
<v Speaker 2>and boarding schools for the children of</v>

95
00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:18.214
<v Speaker 2>native families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government took the children from </v>

96
00:05:20.051 --> 00:05:20.884
<v Speaker 2>the families and sending them to schools</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they would receive an education </v>

97
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.423
<v Speaker 2>which was fully western so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could lose all aspects of that cultural </v>

98
00:05:27.671 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tens of thousands of children,</v>

99
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 2>they were educated in</v>

100
00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.163
<v Speaker 1>this way</v>

101
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.233
<v Speaker 2>and these schools,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they continued until the 1970s and the </v>

102
00:05:40.791 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 2>consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they still have to be dealt with today.</v>

103
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:45.200
<v Speaker 2>Poverty rates are much higher than </v>
<v Speaker 2>average.</v>

104
00:05:45.201 --> 00:05:47.600
<v Speaker 2>There are many broken families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Depression is rampant.</v>

105
00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:50.660
<v Speaker 2>Alcoholism and suicide rates are higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>than average.</v>

106
00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:57.553
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.043
<v Speaker 2>All the consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this sorts of persecution along </v>

108
00:06:01.031 --> 00:06:04.420
<v Speaker 2>with these at racism and exclusion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're also very normal.</v>

109
00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

110
00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.640
<v Speaker 2>In 2008 the prime minister at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Stephen Harper,</v>

111
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.850
<v Speaker 2>apologized to these people's for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>atrocities and established the truth and</v>

112
00:06:14.851 --> 00:06:16.730
<v Speaker 2>Reconciliation Commission.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

113
00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:17.633
<v Speaker 2>Speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I stand before you today to offer an </v>

114
00:06:19.471 --> 00:06:23.640
<v Speaker 2>apology to former students of Indian </v>
<v Speaker 2>residential schools.</v>

115
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:25.133
<v Speaker 2>The treatment of children in Indian </v>
<v Speaker 2>residential schools is a sad chapter in </v>

116
00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:30.504
<v Speaker 2>our history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've also paid hundreds of millions </v>

117
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.280
<v Speaker 2>of dollars in reparations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That money can't fix all these problems.</v>

118
00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:38.710
<v Speaker 2>Even today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada is still looking for the best way</v>

119
00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 2>to move forward from this dark period of</v>
<v Speaker 2>its history,</v>

120
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:44.860
<v Speaker 2>but now let's step back forward to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present day and look at the relationship</v>

121
00:06:44.861 --> 00:06:47.650
<v Speaker 2>between Canada and the u s oh well more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

122
00:06:47.651 --> 00:06:49.030
<v Speaker 2>Canada and president</v>

123
00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:52.170
<v Speaker 1>from [inaudible].</v>

124
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 2>The breakup threat</v>

125
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 2>is very dependent on its relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the United States.</v>

126
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:02.174
<v Speaker 2>They are so dependent that we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost say that the Canadians would be </v>

127
00:07:04.491 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 2>unable to live without best southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbor.</v>

128
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.903
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 70% of Canadian trade is bound </v>

129
00:07:10.671 --> 00:07:11.504
<v Speaker 2>for the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but at the industrial sector of both </v>

130
00:07:13.971 --> 00:07:16.190
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's strongly interconnected.</v>

131
00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:17.083
<v Speaker 2>So this is a special relationship and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is something Justin Trudeau knows </v>

132
00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 2>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He said so in his campaign,</v>

133
00:07:23.241 --> 00:07:24.074
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as he reached power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the concentrated is international </v>

134
00:07:26.411 --> 00:07:30.530
<v Speaker 2>affairs and to improving Canada's </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship with the United States.</v>

135
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 2>And so truth be told is the relationship</v>
<v Speaker 2>that he built with Obama.</v>

136
00:07:39.190 --> 00:07:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Thank you again for your leadership and </v>
<v Speaker 2>your friendship.</v>

137
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:48.790
<v Speaker 2>I know that our two countries can </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve great things by working together</v>

138
00:07:48.791 --> 00:07:53.110
<v Speaker 2>as allies and as friends as we have done</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many times</v>

139
00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:54.003
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

140
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.090
<v Speaker 2>There's some things we will probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>never agree on who's beer is better,</v>

141
00:08:06.010 --> 00:08:07.000
<v Speaker 2>who's better at hockey?</v>

142
00:08:12.150 --> 00:08:16.740
<v Speaker 2>Trump's in office and is pursuing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy of protectionism Canada.</v>

143
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:20.610
<v Speaker 2>What they've done to our dairy farm </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers is a disgrace.</v>

144
00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:22.013
<v Speaker 2>It's a disgrace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what did the Canadian government </v>

145
00:08:24.241 --> 00:08:24.900
<v Speaker 2>do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

146
00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:25.733
<v Speaker 2>they set up something of a war room.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an office dedicated to </v>

147
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 2>following all the movements of the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>administration in Washington.</v>

148
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:32.543
<v Speaker 2>At first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the strategy of Trudeau and his people </v>

149
00:08:33.721 --> 00:08:34.554
<v Speaker 2>was buttering up the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>government's and is it kind of looked </v>

150
00:08:36.361 --> 00:08:38.940
<v Speaker 2>like it was working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Canadian Prime Minister even started</v>

151
00:08:38.941 --> 00:08:42.510
<v Speaker 2>a friendship with Ivanka trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump's daughter Justin Trudeau,</v>

152
00:08:42.511 --> 00:08:45.870
<v Speaker 2>brings Ivanka trump to Broadway show on </v>
<v Speaker 2>welcoming outsiders.</v>

153
00:08:46.080 --> 00:08:46.913
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this opened the door to all sorts of </v>

154
00:08:49.231 --> 00:08:50.064
<v Speaker 2>wild rumors and speculation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is they got on well and both </v>

155
00:08:53.311 --> 00:08:54.144
<v Speaker 2>have led a seminar on women in business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump himself mentioned in a </v>

156
00:08:57.101 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>speech to Congress with the help of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.</v>

157
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 2>We have formed a council with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors and Canada to help ensure that</v>

158
00:09:04.531 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 2>women entrepreneurs have access to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>networks,</v>

159
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:07.853
<v Speaker 2>markets and capital they need to start a</v>
<v Speaker 2>business and live out their financial </v>

160
00:09:10.861 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 2>dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump.</v>

161
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:14.340
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I say this was all great.</v>

162
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:19.130
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to be working really well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bob's then all of a sudden trump attacks</v>

163
00:09:19.140 --> 00:09:19.973
<v Speaker 2>and accused Canada rather.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've done expectedly of unfair </v>

164
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.540
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that he also did with Mexico,</v>

165
00:09:25.541 --> 00:09:26.374
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

166
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:29.403
<v Speaker 2>It would be really dangerous,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Canada to suffer a restriction on </v>

167
00:09:31.451 --> 00:09:32.284
<v Speaker 2>trade relations with the u s government </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ottawa decided to start these so </v>

168
00:09:35.711 --> 00:09:36.544
<v Speaker 2>called a doughnut strategy consisting of</v>
<v Speaker 2>influencing all institutions around the </v>

169
00:09:40.750 --> 00:09:41.583
<v Speaker 2>White House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be considered as being in </v>

170
00:09:42.491 --> 00:09:47.380
<v Speaker 2>the center of that hole of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question it now becomes,</v>

171
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:49.260
<v Speaker 2>will they achieve that goal?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

172
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.113
<v Speaker 2>Lead time will say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first challenge is to renegotiate </v>

173
00:09:51.881 --> 00:09:54.100
<v Speaker 2>Nafta as trump has demand it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

174
00:09:54.101 --> 00:09:54.934
<v Speaker 2>next step,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to consider another essential </v>

175
00:09:55.961 --> 00:09:58.740
<v Speaker 2>crisis that could threaten Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity.</v>

176
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

177
00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.260
<v Speaker 2>Real estate bubble.</v>

178
00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:04.733
<v Speaker 1>Hmm.</v>

179
00:10:05.460 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 2>Prices and Canada's housing market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have absolutely skyrocketed.</v>

180
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:13.320
<v Speaker 2>They've increased 76% and so have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loans that banks are providing.</v>

181
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.333
<v Speaker 2>Indeed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family debt in Canada is now among the </v>

182
00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 2>highest in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Have a look at this chart.</v>

183
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:21.370
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the increase in Canadian real</v>
<v Speaker 2>estate prices?</v>

184
00:10:24.370 --> 00:10:25.360
<v Speaker 1>And then we'll</v>

185
00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:26.810
<v Speaker 2>what's considered family.</v>

186
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:32.360
<v Speaker 1>But as you</v>

187
00:10:32.580 --> 00:10:35.400
<v Speaker 2>measuring this is set off all sorts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic alarms.</v>

188
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.263
<v Speaker 2>Many analysts foresee at the popping of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian real estate bubble along </v>

189
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:42.780
<v Speaker 2>with all the consequences that that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would have on its economy.</v>

190
00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:43.733
<v Speaker 2>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 7% of the country's employments </v>

191
00:10:45.151 --> 00:10:45.984
<v Speaker 2>belongs to the construction sector and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to this mortgage boom at three </v>

192
00:10:48.811 --> 00:10:52.380
<v Speaker 2>Canadian banks are now in the top 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>banks worldwide.</v>

193
00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:53.273
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market value of the Royal Bank of </v>

194
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Canada is higher than that of any bank </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the eurozone.</v>

195
00:10:59.250 --> 00:10:59.910
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

196
00:10:59.910 --> 00:11:00.743
<v Speaker 2>As everyone knows,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences of the real estate </v>

197
00:11:02.431 --> 00:11:05.580
<v Speaker 2>bubble bursting would be pretty dire to </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing something about.</v>

198
00:11:05.581 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 2>This has to come another priority of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian government,</v>

199
00:11:08.730 --> 00:11:09.563
<v Speaker 2>the government's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's trying to stimulate other sectors </v>

200
00:11:10.981 --> 00:11:13.530
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cooling down the real estate market,</v>

201
00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:14.423
<v Speaker 2>maybe the intention,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you increase the arrival of </v>

202
00:11:15.481 --> 00:11:18.690
<v Speaker 2>immigrants by 50% every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has a lot to do with this.</v>

203
00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:21.420
<v Speaker 2>More immigrants means more demand for </v>
<v Speaker 2>real estate,</v>

204
00:11:21.450 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 2>but other experts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they disagree with this and state.</v>

205
00:11:23.581 --> 00:11:24.414
<v Speaker 2>The Canadian banks were not affected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2008 crisis and that they are quite </v>

206
00:11:28.681 --> 00:11:32.430
<v Speaker 2>a bit more solid than other </v>
<v Speaker 2>international banks and also the economy</v>

207
00:11:32.431 --> 00:11:33.264
<v Speaker 2>in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's doing quite well and is gaining </v>

208
00:11:34.711 --> 00:11:36.650
<v Speaker 2>strength after some pretty mediocre.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

209
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:37.533
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

210
00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:42.790
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>time will tell,</v>

211
00:11:42.791 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 2>but this is a risk that the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to have to look out for.</v>

212
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:46.463
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now let's move on to the matter of </v>

213
00:11:47.801 --> 00:11:48.940
<v Speaker 2>public services.</v>

214
00:11:51.850 --> 00:11:52.683
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

215
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:54.063
<v Speaker 2>The waiting lists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Health is a public service which is </v>

216
00:11:58.931 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 2>managed and financed by the governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the citizens and its taxes.</v>

217
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.154
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this system is considered to be one of </v>

218
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:05.740
<v Speaker 2>the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

219
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 2>they have recently had to deal with some</v>
<v Speaker 2>very serious problems and most important</v>

220
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:13.360
<v Speaker 2>of all of these problems is the issue of</v>
<v Speaker 2>waiting lists.</v>

221
00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:14.313
<v Speaker 2>According to the Fraser Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the average time to see a specialist is </v>

222
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>18 weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's more than four months,</v>

223
00:12:19.960 --> 00:12:20.793
<v Speaker 2>and the demographic of the aging </v>
<v Speaker 2>population and the increase of life </v>

224
00:12:22.901 --> 00:12:25.240
<v Speaker 2>expectancy has made it difficult for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>system</v>

225
00:12:25.420 --> 00:12:26.253
<v Speaker 1>cut</v>

226
00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.513
<v Speaker 2>resulted in tens of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadians and moving to the u s to </v>

227
00:12:31.361 --> 00:12:32.194
<v Speaker 2>receive medical attention lately that </v>
<v Speaker 2>has even popular to take our medical </v>

228
00:12:35.081 --> 00:12:37.000
<v Speaker 2>insurance in the United States.</v>

229
00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:40.163
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the main challenges and </v>

230
00:12:41.551 --> 00:12:43.500
<v Speaker 2>threats to the government of Justin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Trudeau.</v>

231
00:12:43.560 --> 00:12:45.600
<v Speaker 2>Like we said earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything,</v>

232
00:12:45.601 --> 00:12:48.060
<v Speaker 2>and be sunshine and lollipops and </v>
<v Speaker 2>rainbows,</v>

233
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.133
<v Speaker 2>but you know what we think are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overall results of the Canadian </v>

234
00:12:51.391 --> 00:12:52.440
<v Speaker 2>cocktail.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

235
00:12:52.470 --> 00:12:55.200
<v Speaker 2>we think it looks pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now it's your turn.</v>

236
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.480
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of Canada and their </v>
