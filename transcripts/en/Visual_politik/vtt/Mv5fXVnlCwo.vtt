1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>One thing is very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin is one of the most </v>

2
00:00:03.001 --> 00:00:03.834
<v Speaker 1>controversial politicians in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is vitalized by some and hated by </v>

3
00:00:08.311 --> 00:00:09.144
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what is for sure is that Putin's </v>

4
00:00:10.411 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>period in office is making its mark on </v>
<v Speaker 1>international politics.</v>

5
00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.280
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that the government has </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved little in terms of economic and</v>

6
00:00:17.281 --> 00:00:18.114
<v Speaker 1>social matters under his leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His popularity among Russians remains </v>

7
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.660
<v Speaker 1>really high today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>

8
00:00:24.661 --> 00:00:28.890
<v Speaker 1>we're going to analyze why Putin is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite popular in Russia,</v>

9
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.213
<v Speaker 1>so this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Spanish saying that says after the </v>

10
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:40.940
<v Speaker 1>storm that comes the calm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:40.941 --> 00:00:44.300
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is exactly what happens after going</v>

12
00:00:44.301 --> 00:00:45.134
<v Speaker 1>through a tough crisis in the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years due to the fall in oil prices as </v>

13
00:00:47.811 --> 00:00:48.644
<v Speaker 1>well as the sanctions received from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international community for occupying </v>

14
00:00:50.901 --> 00:00:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Crimea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government has been pretty blunt,</v>

15
00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.820
<v Speaker 1>but difficult times have passed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ams.</v>

16
00:00:55.821 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 1>The Russian economy is back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it really,</v>

17
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where's the evidence to really back this</v>

18
00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:02.834
<v Speaker 1>up and tell me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think Russian grief is </v>

19
00:01:04.431 --> 00:01:08.120
<v Speaker 1>expected to be in 2017?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twelve percent maybe nine,</v>

20
00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:09.130
<v Speaker 1>five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>

21
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>two?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

22
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually predicted to be one </v>

23
00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>percent</v>

24
00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.000
<v Speaker 2>month after month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russian economy keeps growing.</v>

25
00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.893
<v Speaker 2>For 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're expecting a growth of one percent </v>

26
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.040
<v Speaker 2>or even more Igor Shuvalov</v>

27
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.963
<v Speaker 1>that sure doesn't look like a lot and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's bearing in mind that Russia is </v>

28
00:01:25.271 --> 00:01:27.550
<v Speaker 1>not exactly a rich country to begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

29
00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:28.384
<v Speaker 1>and to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that one percent is only if we believe </v>

30
00:01:30.341 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the statistics of the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's,</v>

31
00:01:32.291 --> 00:01:33.124
<v Speaker 1>which well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more analysts considered to be </v>

32
00:01:34.841 --> 00:01:37.750
<v Speaker 1>rather fictitious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that even though everything</v>

33
00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:38.584
<v Speaker 1>seems to indicate that the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is more stable for last few </v>

34
00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:42.303
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have not exactly been easy for the </v>

35
00:01:43.601 --> 00:01:46.210
<v Speaker 1>Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the Russian social security</v>

36
00:01:46.211 --> 00:01:47.044
<v Speaker 1>institutes in the year 2016 alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian citizens suffered from the </v>

37
00:01:50.261 --> 00:01:51.094
<v Speaker 1>biggest loss in purchasing power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means real income since the 19 </v>

38
00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:56.100
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not a good</v>

39
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.043
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The crisis and the depreciation of the </v>

40
00:01:58.851 --> 00:01:59.684
<v Speaker 2>ruble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Russian currency has led to this </v>

41
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:02.594
<v Speaker 2>country with $145 million inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tabet GDP that's similar to that of </v>

42
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:07.244
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which only has a population of $23 </v>

43
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:09.960
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>

44
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.770
<v Speaker 1>And what's even worse is that for now it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't look like the situation is going</v>

45
00:02:13.771 --> 00:02:14.604
<v Speaker 1>to improve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we come to the great Russian </v>

46
00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.733
<v Speaker 1>anomaly evidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which shows that this country is very </v>

47
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:21.144
<v Speaker 1>different from any other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither the crisis and all these </v>

48
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.083
<v Speaker 1>terrible economic conditions have </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged the national popularity of </v>

49
00:02:26.731 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

50
00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.860
<v Speaker 1>Putin's popularity is today higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much ever been.</v>

51
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>According to polls from the Levada </v>
<v Speaker 1>Center,</v>

52
00:02:33.781 --> 00:02:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Putin's approval rating among the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian population is almost 80 percent.</v>

53
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.160
<v Speaker 1>I'll have a look at it.</v>

54
00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.993
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

55
00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:45.803
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering how is this even </v>

56
00:02:46.921 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 1>possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this man immune to such a crisis?</v>

57
00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:50.663
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at just what is </v>

58
00:02:51.541 --> 00:02:52.374
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>

59
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 3>The protective father,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when the Russian</v>

60
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.210
<v Speaker 1>economy is pretty much mandatory to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about oil and raw materials,</v>

61
00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.133
<v Speaker 1>and here are two pieces of information </v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can get some idea of just how </v>

62
00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 1>dependent on Russia is on these </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources</v>

63
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.230
<v Speaker 2>before the fall.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the prices of crude oil,</v>

64
00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.530
<v Speaker 2>oil and natural gas meant a lot to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian economy.</v>

65
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:17.693
<v Speaker 2>Seventy percent of the country's exports</v>
<v Speaker 2>and more than 50 percent of all income </v>

66
00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:24.060
<v Speaker 2>of the Russian government came from </v>
<v Speaker 2>these two commodities.</v>

67
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.380
<v Speaker 1>And take a look at the evolution of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>price of oil during the years.</v>

68
00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>Peter has been in office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway.</v>

69
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.694
<v Speaker 1>Well Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was incredibly lucky right after he </v>

70
00:03:35.831 --> 00:03:36.664
<v Speaker 1>reached out the price of oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which should remained stable around $20 </v>

71
00:03:39.101 --> 00:03:39.934
<v Speaker 1>a barrel for the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started to increase quickly and of </v>

72
00:03:42.731 --> 00:03:43.564
<v Speaker 1>course this is an amazing flow of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming into the country just so you can </v>

73
00:03:46.631 --> 00:03:47.464
<v Speaker 1>get an idea of how significant this was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The share the government contributed to </v>

74
00:03:50.201 --> 00:03:54.520
<v Speaker 1>the economy rose from 35 percent to 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

75
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.610
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden prosperity came to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire nation.</v>

76
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.850
<v Speaker 1>There were cranes everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Skyscrapers started to appear as if they</v>

77
00:04:00.851 --> 00:04:01.684
<v Speaker 1>were mushrooms after the rain and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard of living for Russians went up </v>

78
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:06.790
<v Speaker 1>and up and up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

79
00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.713
<v Speaker 1>So it is true that Putin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism could be felt right </v>

80
00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.740
<v Speaker 1>from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean say what you ucas.</v>

81
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.510
<v Speaker 1>The money was flowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

82
00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.403
<v Speaker 1>so we could say that there was this sort</v>
<v Speaker 1>of agreements between Russian society </v>

83
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>leader in exchange for not asking you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about civil liberties or corruption.</v>

84
00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.930
<v Speaker 1>The government gave prosperity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability to the citizens.</v>

85
00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.560
<v Speaker 1>In a way Putin became some sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protective father to the nation.</v>

86
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.710
<v Speaker 1>A tough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capable father who was able to take care</v>

87
00:04:35.711 --> 00:04:39.280
<v Speaker 1>of his children has always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that these situations are</v>

88
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:40.114
<v Speaker 1>fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know government's not even Putin's as </v>

89
00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:45.290
<v Speaker 1>the capacity of achieving this </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity all on its higher.</v>

90
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.010
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

91
00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.803
<v Speaker 1>With such high oil prices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin didn't conduct any reforms in </v>

92
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:54.254
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

93
00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:56.450
<v Speaker 1>what would really be the point ends up </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of that.</v>

94
00:04:56.451 --> 00:05:00.030
<v Speaker 1>When the price of oil starts to go down </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the summer of 2014,</v>

95
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.973
<v Speaker 1>the economy of Russia followed the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>pattern and it is here that we come to </v>

96
00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:05.953
<v Speaker 1>the most interesting part of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these things affected Putin's </v>

97
00:05:09.291 --> 00:05:11.220
<v Speaker 1>popularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Russian president knew,</v>

98
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.260
<v Speaker 1>for want of a better word,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to recycle his earliest strategy.</v>

99
00:05:15.261 --> 00:05:17.690
<v Speaker 1>If at the beginning he was the guardian </v>
<v Speaker 1>of prosperity,</v>

100
00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.553
<v Speaker 1>now he would become the leader who would</v>
<v Speaker 1>recover the previous great influenced </v>

101
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:23.360
<v Speaker 1>that mother Russia use to have</v>

102
00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:27.640
<v Speaker 3>nationalist</v>

103
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:28.563
<v Speaker 1>fervor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry if Russia's economy wasn't having </v>

104
00:05:32.081 --> 00:05:33.010
<v Speaker 1>the best moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:05:33.011 --> 00:05:36.420
<v Speaker 1>he had to look for another source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>popularity and Putin,</v>

106
00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he knew where to find it.</v>

107
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.053
<v Speaker 1>For 500 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia's foreign policy was all about </v>

108
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.573
<v Speaker 1>expanding its influenced since the times</v>
<v Speaker 1>of only when the terrible around the </v>

109
00:05:45.101 --> 00:05:48.400
<v Speaker 1>14th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia expanded its territory on average</v>

110
00:05:48.430 --> 00:05:49.263
<v Speaker 1>80 square kilometers a day until it </v>
<v Speaker 1>became by far the largest country on </v>

111
00:05:52.751 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>earth dance well as the most powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

112
00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.953
<v Speaker 1>after the fall of the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the influence of Russia on the world </v>

113
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.760
<v Speaker 1>collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puson made a new promise and it could be</v>

114
00:06:07.851 --> 00:06:12.851
<v Speaker 1>summarized like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be a prosperous country and the economic</v>

115
00:06:22.271 --> 00:06:23.104
<v Speaker 1>situation may be bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I bladimir poutine will recover </v>

116
00:06:26.351 --> 00:06:30.070
<v Speaker 1>Russia's influence in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may not be your wealthy people.</v>

117
00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:30.963
<v Speaker 1>Bless you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our nation will be strong in order to </v>

118
00:06:37.151 --> 00:06:40.120
<v Speaker 1>make this strategy work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some things on unnecessary.</v>

119
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>The first of them is to praise </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalist sentiments,</v>

120
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>and this means well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

121
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more.</v>

122
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:46.420
<v Speaker 1>Russia</v>

123
00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:51.420
<v Speaker 2>bladimir unveiled a statue of medieval </v>
<v Speaker 2>namesake who united Russian land.</v>

124
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either way following these same ideals,</v>

125
00:06:54.541 --> 00:06:57.810
<v Speaker 1>all the recurring adverts of new </v>
<v Speaker 1>invincible weapons,</v>

126
00:06:57.840 --> 00:06:58.673
<v Speaker 1>incredibly powerful ones which will </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee you Russia gains great status </v>

127
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:04.020
<v Speaker 1>and global supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

128
00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:04.854
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important question is going to be </v>

129
00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:09.540
<v Speaker 1>whether the Russian governments can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually afford these weapons.</v>

130
00:07:09.570 --> 00:07:13.950
<v Speaker 1>The second necessary thing is rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>more sinister and that's going to be for</v>

131
00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:14.813
<v Speaker 1>Russia to find an enemy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This enemy is something that can push </v>

132
00:07:17.611 --> 00:07:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Russians towards a common goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain that a little further.</v>

133
00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.330
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need a threats.</v>

134
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:24.183
<v Speaker 1>They need an aggressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need something for the Russians to </v>

135
00:07:26.281 --> 00:07:27.114
<v Speaker 1>unite against,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in order to achieve that content </v>

136
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.050
<v Speaker 1>requires an aggressive foreign policy.</v>

137
00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.903
<v Speaker 3>I see</v>

138
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:35.633
<v Speaker 1>the Ukrainian crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accusations against NATO and the </v>

139
00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:38.604
<v Speaker 1>occupation of Crimea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All examples that have made Putin's </v>

140
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:44.010
<v Speaker 1>popularity rise again in the alleys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the Russians,</v>

141
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Putin is taking Russia back to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous grants.</v>

142
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:48.523
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

143
00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:52.813
<v Speaker 1>second strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can explain the busy schedule of </v>

144
00:07:54.731 --> 00:07:56.860
<v Speaker 1>rough and diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last few years,</v>

145
00:07:56.950 --> 00:08:00.040
<v Speaker 1>they may not have much money that Moscow</v>
<v Speaker 1>is everywhere,</v>

146
00:08:00.041 --> 00:08:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Syria and North Africa,</v>

147
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:03.430
<v Speaker 1>and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>

148
00:08:03.431 --> 00:08:04.264
<v Speaker 1>the sanctions the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>community have imposed on Russia had </v>

149
00:08:06.821 --> 00:08:09.370
<v Speaker 1>kind of the opposite effect that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>

150
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:10.263
<v Speaker 1>They have been seen by the Russians as </v>
<v Speaker 1>humiliating and if they've had any </v>

151
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:13.864
<v Speaker 1>effects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was to consolidate popular support </v>

152
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:17.740
<v Speaker 1>for Vladimir Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy five,</v>

153
00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.593
<v Speaker 2>four percent of Russians consider the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctions to be an intention to weaken </v>

154
00:08:22.351 --> 00:08:24.930
<v Speaker 2>and humiliate Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Only five percent.</v>

155
00:08:25.020 --> 00:08:28.500
<v Speaker 2>Think of them as an instrument to stop </v>
<v Speaker 2>the conflict in Ukraine,</v>

156
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:29.423
<v Speaker 2>Levada center</v>

157
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 1>and last of all for Putin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is unnecessary for him to consolidate</v>

158
00:08:33.201 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>to the image of a strong determined </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>

159
00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:39.430
<v Speaker 1>almost a national hero something of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>savior,</v>

160
00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:40.353
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no Russia today if there is no </v>

161
00:08:42.881 --> 00:08:43.960
<v Speaker 1>Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

162
00:08:43.990 --> 00:08:44.823
<v Speaker 1>These are the keys and understanding why</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin has been able to keep an </v>

163
00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:48.693
<v Speaker 1>even increases popularity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is no longer the guardian of </v>

164
00:08:51.251 --> 00:08:54.670
<v Speaker 1>prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the leader who will regain the power</v>

165
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:59.671
<v Speaker 1>that Russia ones had crony capitalism.</v>

166
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.023
<v Speaker 1>Another decisiveness at Sydney </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered is that Putin's governments </v>

167
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.113
<v Speaker 1>also survivors because he has been able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to create a network of powerful </v>

168
00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:09.983
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs around him who have gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich thanks to the resources of the </v>

169
00:09:12.451 --> 00:09:13.284
<v Speaker 1>Russian state governments aids launch </v>
<v Speaker 1>state contracts and things in its </v>

170
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:18.670
<v Speaker 1>commitments to replace imports have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefited.</v>

171
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:19.523
<v Speaker 1>These oligarchs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former judo partner awarded contract to </v>

172
00:09:23.041 --> 00:09:28.041
<v Speaker 1>build Russian bridge to Crimea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll cost more than $3,000,000,000</v>

173
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>besides speak to it as a backup plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In case things go awry,</v>

174
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.630
<v Speaker 1>he can privatized or more accurately </v>
<v Speaker 1>just give states companies away to these</v>

175
00:09:36.631 --> 00:09:40.890
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs who will use that power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to further Putin's interests.</v>

176
00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.753
<v Speaker 1>The Russian president has made it clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nobody strategic investors will be </v>

177
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>allowed to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>privatizations,</v>

178
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:48.343
<v Speaker 1>and that means only investors who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been selected by the Russian </v>

179
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:55.930
<v Speaker 1>government's iron fist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

180
00:09:56.310 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>Ron's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lest we forget the repression,</v>

181
00:09:58.980 --> 00:10:01.380
<v Speaker 1>political repression and the repression </v>
<v Speaker 1>of minorities.</v>

182
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.010
<v Speaker 1>That seems to be kind of a fetish for </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictators and potential dictators.</v>

183
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:06.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just take a look at the last report from</v>

184
00:10:06.991 --> 00:10:09.690
<v Speaker 1>Amnesty International on human rights in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>

185
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:10.943
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty sad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Restrictions on right to freedom of </v>

186
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:15.234
<v Speaker 1>expression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>association and Peaceful Assembly </v>

187
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:20.160
<v Speaker 1>increased in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

188
00:10:20.161 --> 00:10:23.790
<v Speaker 1>now we all know the ingredients that </v>
<v Speaker 1>explains Putin's popularity,</v>

189
00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:25.520
<v Speaker 1>nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs,</v>

190
00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.080
<v Speaker 1>censorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and political repression.</v>

191
00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.973
<v Speaker 1>Putin has promised the people that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>will become powerful again in exchange </v>

192
00:10:32.221 --> 00:10:34.530
<v Speaker 1>for that unconditional loyalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

193
00:10:34.531 --> 00:10:35.364
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this posturing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it does seem kind of unlikely that </v>

194
00:10:37.891 --> 00:10:38.724
<v Speaker 1>Russia is going to be able to seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>competes with either China or the US in </v>

195
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:44.780
<v Speaker 1>the media and in the long run,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's our opinion here,</v>

196
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as always,</v>

00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:49.410
<v Speaker 1>we'd love to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Putin will be successful in</v>

198
00:10:49.411 --> 00:10:52.450
<v Speaker 1>giving Russia rids old power back?</v>

<v Speaker 1>and freedom.</v>

<v Speaker 1>but we'd like to know what you would </v>
