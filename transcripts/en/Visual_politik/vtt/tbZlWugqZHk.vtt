00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.323
<v Speaker 2>many of you probably think all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the Arabian peninsula are </v>

3
00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:12.440
<v Speaker 2>insanely wealthy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

4
00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>I mean this is the region of the wells </v>
<v Speaker 2>where Qatar do volume.</v>

5
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:15.854
<v Speaker 2>The rest of the oral Monica is our after</v>
<v Speaker 2>all nonetheless arise in this region of </v>

6
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:21.140
<v Speaker 2>the planet is a country that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely poor.</v>

7
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.640
<v Speaker 2>The place where the GDP per capita lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>than that of Tanzania or Senegal,</v>

8
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.713
<v Speaker 2>the name of this country is Yemen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they just come with and going through a </v>

9
00:00:29.181 --> 00:00:34.181
<v Speaker 2>civil war that is lost dude for two </v>
<v Speaker 2>years and look this,</v>

10
00:00:37.671 --> 00:00:38.900
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no small war.</v>

11
00:00:38.901 --> 00:00:39.734
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war in Yemen is the Arabian </v>

12
00:00:41.061 --> 00:00:41.894
<v Speaker 2>equivalents to the war in Vietnam and we</v>
<v Speaker 2>find two of the biggest powers in the </v>

13
00:00:45.291 --> 00:00:48.320
<v Speaker 2>Muslim world supporting different sides </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the conflicts.</v>

14
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand we have the Yemeni </v>
<v Speaker 2>government supported by Saudi Arabia and</v>

15
00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.053
<v Speaker 2>all their allies including the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and the only other side of there </v>

16
00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:01.130
<v Speaker 2>are the revolutionaries backed by Iran </v>
<v Speaker 2>and between these two sides there is the</v>

17
00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:05.390
<v Speaker 2>many branch of dash or the so called and</v>
<v Speaker 2>saw Al Sharia movement.</v>

18
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.653
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've been subscribed to visual </v>

19
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.263
<v Speaker 2>politic for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you already know that Saudi Arabia has </v>

20
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:16.540
<v Speaker 2>the third best equipped army in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire wells boss.</v>

21
00:01:16.541 --> 00:01:18.740
<v Speaker 2>They have the sport of American drones </v>
<v Speaker 2>exams,</v>

22
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.980
<v Speaker 2>the armies of neighboring countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have more than 180 state of the art</v>

23
00:01:22.981 --> 00:01:27.540
<v Speaker 2>combat jets and 300,000 soldiers armed </v>
<v Speaker 2>with the best weapons on the other side.</v>

24
00:01:27.541 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 2>They have less than half that number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers and the weapons.</v>

25
00:01:30.601 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 2>They're armed with our far for modern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

26
00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

27
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.160
<v Speaker 2>this seems like a pretty unequal fight,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

28
00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case in mind,</v>

29
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:44.920
<v Speaker 2>surprise you to learn that Saudi Arabia </v>
<v Speaker 2>is losing this war.</v>

30
00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:48.243
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia says prepared for ceasefire</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Yemen if who feeds agree and so now </v>

31
00:01:51.911 --> 00:01:54.520
<v Speaker 2>you might wonder how exactly is this </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible?</v>

32
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:55.473
<v Speaker 2>How is it possible to explain why one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most advanced armies in the wells </v>

33
00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.030
<v Speaker 2>can speak to a bunch of gorillas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

34
00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 2>today we have a geo politic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:05.290
<v Speaker 2>we're going to answer that question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we get into any of that,</v>

36
00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:10.620
<v Speaker 2>let's have a look at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first thing we need to understand is</v>

37
00:02:14.651 --> 00:02:18.010
<v Speaker 2>that this is not the first time Yemen </v>
<v Speaker 2>has had a civil war.</v>

38
00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.550
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the third one in just 25 years.</v>

39
00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 2>Yemen is a country divided by both </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology as well as religion.</v>

40
00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.763
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before the 1990s at Yemen were split </v>

41
00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.373
<v Speaker 2>into two different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We had south Yemen with a communist </v>

42
00:02:36.731 --> 00:02:38.950
<v Speaker 2>governments and then there was north </v>
<v Speaker 2>Yemen.</v>

43
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 2>You had a pro Saudi government and going</v>
<v Speaker 2>you want to see on the screen now,</v>

44
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:46.480
<v Speaker 2>Ali Abdullah Saleh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who was the president of the north,</v>

45
00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:49.960
<v Speaker 2>started ruling over the entire country </v>
<v Speaker 2>from its capital,</v>

46
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.310
<v Speaker 2>the city of Sonata.</v>

47
00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:56.183
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>slack is one of those politicians who </v>

48
00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.240
<v Speaker 2>consider as democracy and human rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be wow.</v>

49
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:02.074
<v Speaker 2>Pretty optional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four years into his new country's </v>

50
00:03:04.571 --> 00:03:05.404
<v Speaker 2>history and the former southern </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist leaders started an uprising </v>

51
00:03:09.011 --> 00:03:09.844
<v Speaker 2>against the less governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This war only lasted a few months and </v>

52
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.940
<v Speaker 2>the new government is one with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>assistance of the Saudis.</v>

53
00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.960
<v Speaker 2>A decade later in 2004 Yemen had further</v>
<v Speaker 2>antigovernment turmoil.</v>

54
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.500
<v Speaker 2>This time the opposition was a rebel </v>
<v Speaker 2>group of Shia Muslims.</v>

55
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.513
<v Speaker 2>I remember their name because they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>important for the war that's going on </v>

56
00:03:26.831 --> 00:03:27.521
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If he,</v>

57
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:30.010
<v Speaker 2>I called the Houthi rebels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but again,</v>

58
00:03:30.011 --> 00:03:32.130
<v Speaker 2>these are like governments beach down </v>
<v Speaker 2>this uprising.</v>

59
00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.033
<v Speaker 1>Second</v>

60
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.460
<v Speaker 2>in 2011 with the Arab spring in full </v>
<v Speaker 2>swing,</v>

61
00:03:38.461 --> 00:03:40.980
<v Speaker 2>the citizens rebelled against seller </v>
<v Speaker 2>again.</v>

62
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.963
<v Speaker 2>But this time salon I left power with </v>
<v Speaker 2>his prime minister Manso this new </v>

63
00:03:45.991 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 2>president and found himself in control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a terribly weak governments.</v>

64
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.093
<v Speaker 2>Father Ryle Chi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edo we're working on destroying the </v>

65
00:03:51.631 --> 00:03:53.130
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And during all of this,</v>

66
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:55.290
<v Speaker 2>while the protesters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kept protesting.</v>

67
00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Now do you remember those few rentals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we talked about just a moment ago.</v>

68
00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came back,</v>

69
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.930
<v Speaker 2>but this time they were more powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's had a lot of support.</v>

70
00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.040
<v Speaker 2>And this explains why in 2014 they </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to take over the government.</v>

71
00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you might be wondering,</v>

72
00:04:13.351 --> 00:04:15.600
<v Speaker 2>what did Al had he do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.434
<v Speaker 2>he left the capital Lens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>moved to the city of Arden in the south </v>

74
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:21.300
<v Speaker 2>of the country to start a provisional.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Governments</v>

75
00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.780
<v Speaker 2>not remember him that Saudi Arabia is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Sunni Muslim country bands.</v>

76
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:31.614
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the biggest enemy of Sunni </v>

77
00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:33.570
<v Speaker 2>Muslims?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

78
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:34.403
<v Speaker 2>That would be the Shia Muslims.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are exactly the people who have </v>

79
00:04:36.991 --> 00:04:37.824
<v Speaker 2>conquered the capital of Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this explains why the Saudis aren't </v>

80
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:44.520
<v Speaker 2>so keen on supporting our hardy and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>provisional governments in arden.</v>

81
00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.683
<v Speaker 2>Then finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we also have Dash Aka Islamic state in </v>

82
00:04:48.151 --> 00:04:51.380
<v Speaker 2>the next as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who all well in enemy of both sides.</v>

83
00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:52.423
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now we have the Houthi rebels and </v>

84
00:04:53.481 --> 00:04:54.314
<v Speaker 2>their supporters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the who things are Shia Muslims and </v>

85
00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:59.200
<v Speaker 2>therefore they are friends with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hands,</v>

86
00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:00.043
<v Speaker 2>Al Hadi is an artisan antia supported by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudis and the Saudis will do </v>

87
00:05:04.311 --> 00:05:08.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever it takes to ensure that Iranian</v>
<v Speaker 2>influence in Yemen is minimized.</v>

88
00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.913
<v Speaker 2>You probably remember from one of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>previous videos that Saudi Arabia and </v>

89
00:05:12.651 --> 00:05:17.390
<v Speaker 2>Iran on die on enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anne's last in 2015 and another year,</v>

90
00:05:17.391 --> 00:05:18.950
<v Speaker 2>many civil war started.</v>

91
00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.853
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

92
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.590
<v Speaker 2>Natural fortress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When we think about Saudi Arabia,</v>

93
00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 2>we think of a big desert with clean sand</v>
<v Speaker 2>dunes,</v>

94
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.650
<v Speaker 2>Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's rather different.</v>

95
00:05:40.651 --> 00:05:41.484
<v Speaker 2>It is a country full of mountains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost as high as the rockies in the </v>

96
00:05:44.131 --> 00:05:48.240
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some peaks are higher than 3,600 meters.</v>

97
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>What if</v>

98
00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.970
<v Speaker 2>this makes it really hard to transport a</v>
<v Speaker 2>big army no matter how well equipped us.</v>

99
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudis,</v>

100
00:05:58.251 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>they utilize a tank model called the m </v>
<v Speaker 2>one abrams.</v>

101
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:02.713
<v Speaker 2>This is sort of like the BMW of tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now imagine a convoy of these machines </v>

102
00:06:06.771 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 2>crossing a path where they have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>travel in singles,</v>

103
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.633
<v Speaker 3>you would just need a few guerrilla </v>
<v Speaker 3>warriors with an RPG seven rocket </v>

104
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.084
<v Speaker 3>launcher to destroy an entire battalion.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The RPG seven is a rocket launcher that </v>

105
00:06:21.201 --> 00:06:22.034
<v Speaker 3>you can see on video games such as call </v>
<v Speaker 3>of duty and it has a market price of </v>

106
00:06:24.921 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 3>around 3000 US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The m one Abrams tank on the other hand,</v>

107
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.530
<v Speaker 3>cost around $6 million.</v>

108
00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:37.920
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

109
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not any that,</v>

110
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:39.763
<v Speaker 2>as we said at the start of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudi coalition has over 180 combat </v>

111
00:06:43.921 --> 00:06:44.754
<v Speaker 2>jets and also American drones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a further problem here in </v>

112
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.850
<v Speaker 2>the landscape full of mountains and </v>
<v Speaker 2>caves.</v>

113
00:06:50.970 --> 00:06:53.670
<v Speaker 2>It really is easy to hide from these </v>
<v Speaker 2>drones.</v>

114
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:54.623
<v Speaker 2>And also even the state of the art of </v>
<v Speaker 2>radars can see in detail what's inside </v>

115
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:58.883
<v Speaker 2>of the caves</v>

116
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.363
<v Speaker 2>as of course the toothy warriors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They know the battlefield like the back </v>

117
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:08.374
<v Speaker 2>of their hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they know where all the good hiding </v>

118
00:07:10.181 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 2>places are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In many cases,</v>

119
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:12.304
<v Speaker 2>they can travel from one village to </v>
<v Speaker 2>another without being exposed to any of </v>

120
00:07:14.861 --> 00:07:15.694
<v Speaker 2>the drone radars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can also hide their weapons inside </v>

121
00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:21.160
<v Speaker 2>these caves bus that is still not all </v>
<v Speaker 2>evenly.</v>

122
00:07:21.161 --> 00:07:24.130
<v Speaker 2>These gorillas that have no hummers or </v>
<v Speaker 2>rather modern vehicles,</v>

123
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.670
<v Speaker 2>they have something better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have animals.</v>

124
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:29.260
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you heard that right?</v>

125
00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.123
<v Speaker 2>In those high mounds in areas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the least effective way to transport </v>

126
00:07:33.311 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 2>something is by using donkeys or </v>
<v Speaker 2>cameron.</v>

127
00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.500
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new way of tracking the movements of</v>

128
00:07:42.501 --> 00:07:45.710
<v Speaker 2>these guerrilla warriors is by having </v>
<v Speaker 2>people behind the lines.</v>

129
00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:46.813
<v Speaker 2>Now we're not exactly talking double o </v>
<v Speaker 2>seven like spies heritage rather than </v>

130
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:50.884
<v Speaker 2>local citizens who are willing to help </v>
<v Speaker 2>or soldiers who are close to enemy </v>

131
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:54.800
<v Speaker 2>lines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

132
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:55.634
<v Speaker 2>so even with these problems,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might still be wondering how the </v>

133
00:07:58.671 --> 00:07:59.504
<v Speaker 2>Saudis and getting basin the scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemed to still be tips pretty far in </v>

134
00:08:02.821 --> 00:08:04.260
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia's favor.</v>

135
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:10.650
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:08:11.690 --> 00:08:13.370
<v Speaker 2>eight demotivated army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

137
00:08:13.371 --> 00:08:14.204
<v Speaker 2>many of you might think that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>political system of the country has </v>

138
00:08:16.311 --> 00:08:19.830
<v Speaker 2>nothing to do with the way they organize</v>
<v Speaker 2>their army and conducted.</v>

139
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:20.773
<v Speaker 1>Whoa.</v>

140
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.750
<v Speaker 2>Well actually in a country like Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia,</v>

141
00:08:24.810 --> 00:08:25.643
<v Speaker 2>they all really connectors in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute monica like they have in Saudi </v>

142
00:08:29.190 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The royal house cannot trust that army.</v>

143
00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:32.623
<v Speaker 2>Then laying the obsession is keeping </v>
<v Speaker 2>control over the entire military from </v>

144
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:39.630
<v Speaker 2>the top all the way to the bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why the decision making power is</v>

145
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:41.100
<v Speaker 2>slower than in any other</v>

146
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.210
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's</v>

147
00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:51.190
<v Speaker 2>have a look at a hypothetical example </v>
<v Speaker 2>here because it'll illustrate of assets.</v>

148
00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.233
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine a soldier discovers a </v>
<v Speaker 2>machine gun nest that is a three beats </v>

149
00:08:55.551 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 2>is out in western army such as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American or British one.</v>

150
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 2>That soldier can easily ask for </v>
<v Speaker 2>reinforcement by radio.</v>

151
00:09:01.710 --> 00:09:05.460
<v Speaker 2>Usually he or she would go alongside </v>
<v Speaker 2>with another soldier from the air force.</v>

152
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>You can give the exact coordinates to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pilot nearby and in a matter of minutes,</v>

153
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 2>a combat jet is bombing the machine gun </v>
<v Speaker 2>nest.</v>

154
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Now let's consider the Saudi Ami </v>
<v Speaker 2>Festival.</v>

155
00:09:14.551 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 2>That soldier would have to tell the </v>
<v Speaker 2>sergeants and that sergeant,</v>

156
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:19.920
<v Speaker 2>we'd have to speak to someone higher up </v>
<v Speaker 2>and at the time that decision has really</v>

157
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:21.600
<v Speaker 2>reached somebody who can actually make </v>
<v Speaker 2>the decision.</v>

158
00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.553
<v Speaker 2>It's been longer than an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 60 minutes here are the difference </v>

159
00:09:25.711 --> 00:09:29.620
<v Speaker 2>between neutralizing and enemy position </v>
<v Speaker 2>and using a soldier.</v>

160
00:09:29.621 --> 00:09:30.454
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:33.850 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

162
00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.430
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for military training.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most Saudi officials come from the royal</v>

163
00:09:38.431 --> 00:09:42.350
<v Speaker 2>houses and they didn't go through any </v>
<v Speaker 2>sort of academic and military training.</v>

164
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:45.780
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

165
00:09:45.780 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 2>They got that position due to pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>nepotism,</v>

166
00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:49.240
<v Speaker 2>and this means,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

167
00:09:49.241 --> 00:09:50.074
<v Speaker 2>a distinct lack of knowledge and skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for normal soldiers as </v>

168
00:09:53.521 --> 00:09:54.354
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you probably know in most of these </v>

169
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:56.064
<v Speaker 2>oil monarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the needs of citizens work as </v>

170
00:09:57.991 --> 00:09:58.824
<v Speaker 2>civil servants with sky high salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They really don't know anything about </v>

171
00:10:02.221 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>discipline or hard work.</v>

172
00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:04.973
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

173
00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.310
<v Speaker 2>so let's look at an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the video here,</v>

174
00:10:08.311 --> 00:10:09.144
<v Speaker 2>you can see that they don't even know </v>
<v Speaker 2>how to protect the tank with infantry </v>

175
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:22.820
<v Speaker 2>and don't forget that inside that tank </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very difficult to see the outside.</v>

176
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:23.683
<v Speaker 2>This is why a basic principle of war is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you always want to have soldiers </v>

177
00:10:27.051 --> 00:10:30.980
<v Speaker 2>walking around the tank so that they can</v>
<v Speaker 2>see if something is firing upon it.</v>

178
00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:34.280
<v Speaker 2>This really is wall one o one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

179
00:10:34.281 --> 00:10:35.360
<v Speaker 2>the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ms. Dot.</v>

180
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:36.194
<v Speaker 2>Clawson.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This explains why it is so easy to </v>

181
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 2>destroy their tanks with Sinatra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shiva weaponry.</v>

182
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.940
<v Speaker 2>How are we looking at this on the video?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

183
00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:50.910
<v Speaker 2>you can see how someone gets close </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to a tank to put a bomb on it.</v>

184
00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:54.493
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

185
00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:55.573
<v Speaker 2>hand behind.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprisingly that he's he rebels have a </v>

186
00:10:56.901 --> 00:11:00.920
<v Speaker 2>much more western management system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Small groups can react quickly.</v>

187
00:11:00.921 --> 00:11:01.754
<v Speaker 2>Yams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do need to go all the way up </v>

188
00:11:03.111 --> 00:11:03.944
<v Speaker 2>through the hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus then motivation is way higher </v>

189
00:11:10.171 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 2>because they don't have the option of </v>
<v Speaker 2>just retiring.</v>

190
00:11:12.690 --> 00:11:13.523
<v Speaker 2>Arguably,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are defending their home from a </v>

191
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:16.680
<v Speaker 2>foreign army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In summary,</v>

192
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:17.543
<v Speaker 2>the war on Yemen is a really excellent </v>
<v Speaker 2>example of how strategy is more </v>

193
00:11:20.551 --> 00:11:21.384
<v Speaker 2>important than weaponry and is that an </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian system makes for a less </v>

194
00:11:25.021 --> 00:11:25.600
<v Speaker 2>efficient.</v>

195
00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

196
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.893
<v Speaker 2>Sadly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that the Saudis on losing this </v>

197
00:11:31.521 --> 00:11:33.530
<v Speaker 2>wall doesn't mean they're not killing </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

198
00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:34.940
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the opposite,</v>

199
00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:38.540
<v Speaker 1>it's true hole in</v>

200
00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.540
<v Speaker 2>Yemen conflict passes 10,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

201
00:11:41.541 --> 00:11:42.980
<v Speaker 2>what could have been solved in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>peaceful,</v>

202
00:11:42.981 --> 00:11:43.814
<v Speaker 2>democratic way?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has become a war of attrition that </v>

203
00:11:45.351 --> 00:11:46.184
<v Speaker 2>will leave a footprint on this country </v>
<v Speaker 2>for generations to come and now the </v>

204
00:11:48.951 --> 00:11:49.850
<v Speaker 2>question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dean,</v>

205
00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:50.693
<v Speaker 2>you think the Saudis can turn the table </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this conflict or are we going to see </v>

206
00:11:53.591 --> 00:11:55.780
<v Speaker 2>this conflict last for a long time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>come?</v>
