00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.443
<v Speaker 2>we told you in a previous video how </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia wants to leave behind once </v>

3
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:15.470
<v Speaker 2>and for all it's addiction to oil and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's become a nation similar to Dubai or</v>

4
00:00:15.471 --> 00:00:16.304
<v Speaker 2>Abu Dhabi.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this video we are going to look at </v>

5
00:00:17.811 --> 00:00:18.644
<v Speaker 2>the country in more depth in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get an idea of just how this mission to </v>

6
00:00:22.101 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 2>get free from oil is going</v>

7
00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.550
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

8
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:29.853
<v Speaker 2>The thing is there is a specific name,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a leader behind this ambitious plan and </v>

9
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.040
<v Speaker 2>my question to you is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know who this person is?</v>

10
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for those of you don't,</v>

11
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:38.954
<v Speaker 2>the person who is turning everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>upside down in Saudi Arabia is Mohammed </v>

12
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.173
<v Speaker 2>bin Salman.</v>

13
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

14
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 2>My name alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't explain much.</v>

15
00:00:48.141 --> 00:00:48.974
<v Speaker 2>So now you might be wondering who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this man really awesome his intentions </v>

16
00:00:52.671 --> 00:00:56.240
<v Speaker 2>and what exactly is he trying to do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While these are the questions that we're</v>

17
00:00:56.241 --> 00:00:59.390
<v Speaker 2>going to be answering in today's visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic video,</v>

18
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.280
<v Speaker 2>so let's get started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shall We?</v>

19
00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.913
<v Speaker 2>The Prince of change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He might only be a list of more than 30 </v>

20
00:01:08.671 --> 00:01:09.504
<v Speaker 2>years olds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Mohammed bin Salman is already one </v>

21
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 2>of the most powerful people in the wells</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he controls more money than we could</v>

22
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.770
<v Speaker 2>ever possibly count formerly while he is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the minister of Defense,</v>

23
00:01:19.771 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 2>deputy crown prince,</v>
<v Speaker 2>second deputy prime minister,</v>

24
00:01:22.231 --> 00:01:26.820
<v Speaker 2>chief of the royal quarter and chair of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Council for Economic and Development</v>

25
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 2>Affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what does all of this mean?</v>

26
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.170
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mitt kinds of things that the hammer has</v>

27
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:34.710
<v Speaker 2>been sell mom is in control of well </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything.</v>

28
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.100
<v Speaker 2>He's got complete control over the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country's oil,</v>

29
00:01:38.101 --> 00:01:38.934
<v Speaker 2>over the massive financial reserves that</v>
<v Speaker 2>had been accumulated over the years and </v>

30
00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.910
<v Speaker 2>also over Saudi Arabia's massive defense</v>
<v Speaker 2>budgets.</v>

31
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.960
<v Speaker 2>So today the power of the prince is </v>
<v Speaker 2>practically total.</v>

32
00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.183
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this isn't something normally that </v>

33
00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.860
<v Speaker 2>never has such a young man had so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>power before.</v>

34
00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:56.723
<v Speaker 2>I've until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the norm was for the country to be </v>

35
00:01:57.781 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 2>controlled by seniors have 80 or more </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

36
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.660
<v Speaker 2>We were very reluctant to go for any </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of change,</v>

37
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.213
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden changes in the foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because what Mohammed bin Salman is </v>

38
00:02:07.831 --> 00:02:12.540
<v Speaker 2>trying to do with Saudi Arabia is turn </v>
<v Speaker 2>it into a new United Arab Emirates,</v>

39
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 2>a country which the prince has an </v>
<v Speaker 2>enormous amount of admiration for later.</v>

40
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.660
<v Speaker 2>We're going to see just how he is doing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

41
00:02:18.661 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 2>but for now you need to bear something </v>
<v Speaker 2>in mind.</v>

42
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.130
<v Speaker 2>The youth of the country chair been </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salmaan as the savior of the kingdom and</v>

43
00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 2>this is a country where half of its </v>
<v Speaker 2>population is less than 25 years olds.</v>

44
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 2>And so in a country like that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty important.</v>

45
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.780
<v Speaker 2>But so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does this man come from?</v>

46
00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.480
<v Speaker 2>How can such a young man who have so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much power?</v>

47
00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the son of the current king.</v>

48
00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Wait just a second before you explained.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well of course he is because you need to</v>

49
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:49.874
<v Speaker 2>know that being the son of the king in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudi Arabia wasn't always such an </v>

50
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:54.800
<v Speaker 2>important thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

51
00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.820
<v Speaker 2>Banal Been Somal is not even the ad to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudi throne battle over the throne.</v>

52
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.400
<v Speaker 2>It's all one bin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abdulaziz is the king of Saudi Arabia.</v>

53
00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:09.640
<v Speaker 2>He is the son of the man who was </v>
<v Speaker 2>considered the founder of the country.</v>

54
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.533
<v Speaker 2>Abdulaziz been sold since cell died in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1953 the kingdom has been inherited by </v>

55
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 2>brother,</v>
<v Speaker 2>BAFTA,</v>

56
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:18.730
<v Speaker 2>brother Doula.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Z's been sowed,</v>

57
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 2>had 17 known wives and it is calculated </v>
<v Speaker 2>that he also had around 32 sons,</v>

58
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 2>so there were quite a few potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>heirs.</v>

59
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.300
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that when the current is </v>
<v Speaker 2>king,</v>

60
00:03:28.301 --> 00:03:29.134
<v Speaker 2>he was believed to be the 25th son </v>
<v Speaker 2>reached power a few years ago in 2015 </v>

61
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.513
<v Speaker 2>the first thing he did was change the </v>
<v Speaker 2>laws of succession even though some of </v>

62
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:37.384
<v Speaker 2>his brothers are still alive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he has decided to put to the new </v>

63
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:41.710
<v Speaker 2>generations in charge of this process to</v>
<v Speaker 2>do this.</v>

64
00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.440
<v Speaker 2>He has decided to appoint his nephew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Muhammad bin Nayef,</v>

65
00:03:44.441 --> 00:03:45.274
<v Speaker 2>who is closer to Washington than others </v>
<v Speaker 2>and he has been in charge of security </v>

66
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:48.783
<v Speaker 2>for the last few years as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>secret services and the fight against </v>

67
00:03:51.911 --> 00:03:54.880
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

68
00:03:54.881 --> 00:03:55.714
<v Speaker 2>it seems like young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Hamad bin Selma on the main </v>

69
00:03:57.101 --> 00:03:57.934
<v Speaker 2>character in this video it seems he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>not very happy about that and it seems </v>

70
00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.653
<v Speaker 2>that he is taking aim at the throne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wants to be the future king of Saudi </v>

71
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.300
<v Speaker 2>Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so here's eagerness for reforms could be</v>

72
00:04:07.301 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 2>explained as an attempt to to gain </v>
<v Speaker 2>popularity.</v>

73
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact that is what most analysts </v>
<v Speaker 2>currently think that as well.</v>

74
00:04:13.091 --> 00:04:13.924
<v Speaker 2>It does make sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fall of the price of oil has given </v>

75
00:04:16.841 --> 00:04:19.480
<v Speaker 2>Mohammed bin Selma and the opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 2>to aim for the throne,</v>

76
00:04:19.481 --> 00:04:22.150
<v Speaker 2>which is something his father obviously </v>
<v Speaker 2>supports.</v>

77
00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:24.910
<v Speaker 2>If Saudi vision 2030 starts showing good</v>
<v Speaker 2>result in,</v>

78
00:04:24.911 --> 00:04:25.744
<v Speaker 2>someone will be in a better position to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ask for a reward and it's become </v>

79
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:30.880
<v Speaker 2>potentially the new add to the throne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

80
00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:31.743
<v Speaker 2>there are a few problems on the road </v>
<v Speaker 2>ahead both for been some on as well as </v>

81
00:04:35.051 --> 00:04:36.290
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

82
00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 2>there are problems inside the royal </v>
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

83
00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.220
<v Speaker 2>Then someone has made a lot of enemies </v>
<v Speaker 2>who accused him of being power hungry.</v>

84
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:43.440
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his father,</v>

85
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.700
<v Speaker 2>the currents king is quite old,</v>
<v Speaker 2>81 years.</v>

86
00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.380
<v Speaker 2>He seems to have some memory issues.</v>

87
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>So this means that there are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible scenarios ahead.</v>

88
00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.350
<v Speaker 2>If the current's king,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was so many more years,</v>

89
00:04:54.351 --> 00:04:57.200
<v Speaker 2>the Prince bin on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be able to consolidate his power.</v>

90
00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the king doesn't live so long,</v>

91
00:04:58.851 --> 00:04:59.684
<v Speaker 2>the current had been some Alan's cousin </v>
<v Speaker 2>could become the new king and wish </v>

92
00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:03.583
<v Speaker 2>goodbye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both do the prints and his Saudi vision </v>

93
00:05:05.331 --> 00:05:05.920
<v Speaker 2>2030</v>

94
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.753
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

95
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.713
<v Speaker 2>Mars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is is that this is how </v>

96
00:05:10.861 --> 00:05:11.694
<v Speaker 2>Monica is work,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure that some of you by </v>

97
00:05:13.351 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 2>now you're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is all fascinating Simon,</v>

98
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:18.990
<v Speaker 2>but why should I care what happens into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia?</v>

99
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:19.860
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should.</v>

100
00:05:19.861 --> 00:05:21.960
<v Speaker 2>Katherine's probably more than you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

101
00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:22.823
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia is still the biggest oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>producer now and it is also the most </v>

102
00:05:26.581 --> 00:05:29.030
<v Speaker 2>important and influential country in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Arab.</v>

103
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.960
<v Speaker 2>evolution towards openness for this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

105
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.900
<v Speaker 2>It could be something very positive for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world's cans for now,</v>

106
00:05:39.901 --> 00:05:40.734
<v Speaker 2>the plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi vision 2030 it seems to be the </v>

107
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 2>only opportunity for the country to </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress and evolve.</v>

108
00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:47.063
<v Speaker 2>But now that we've said that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is the plan for this </v>

109
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:49.500
<v Speaker 2>coming?</v>

110
00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incorrigibles</v>

111
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.183
<v Speaker 2>so far in today's story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've seen a handsome prince and the </v>

112
00:06:00.071 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 2>battle over the throne,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we need a third ingredients for this</v>

113
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Saudi soap opera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's luxury hands money.</v>

114
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the royal families in the world,</v>

115
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:10.364
<v Speaker 2>the Saudis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the royal household of Saudi Arabia </v>

116
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 2>mights be the most addicted to money and</v>
<v Speaker 2>luxury as well.</v>

117
00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>Now you're going to see why,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we have mentioned in several videos,</v>

118
00:06:18.591 --> 00:06:19.424
<v Speaker 2>the fall of oil prices is jeopardized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many countries and among them is Saudi </v>

119
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:27.650
<v Speaker 2>Arabia only in 2016 and even though many</v>
<v Speaker 2>adjustments were made,</v>

120
00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:28.513
<v Speaker 2>the country had a deficit of more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>$80 billion and is now the question </v>

121
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 2>becomes what can they do in order to fix</v>
<v Speaker 2>such a hole in their budget?</v>

122
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:38.053
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2016 the Saudi government announced </v>

123
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:41.930
<v Speaker 2>that the country was going to go on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>diet.</v>

124
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:45.890
<v Speaker 2>For the first time in decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>austerity reached Saudi Arabia.</v>

125
00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:50.570
<v Speaker 2>The government have been Salmaan started</v>
<v Speaker 2>with reductions in public wages,</v>

126
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.630
<v Speaker 2>cancelled many projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose profitability was uncertain,</v>

127
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 2>reduce subsidies and gasoline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

128
00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:57.133
<v Speaker 2>electricity.</v>

129
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:02.693
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

130
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:07.613
<v Speaker 2>it was a pretty huge shock for one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most subsidized economies in the </v>

131
00:07:10.471 --> 00:07:11.161
<v Speaker 2>wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

132
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:12.220
<v Speaker 2>up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you have,</v>

133
00:07:12.221 --> 00:07:13.054
<v Speaker 2>you will oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It helps pay for everything in Saudi </v>

134
00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:15.900
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

135
00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:17.580
<v Speaker 2>hold on for just a moment because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

136
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:20.700
<v Speaker 2>that's not the whole story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under Solomon's rule,</v>

137
00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.520
<v Speaker 2>prince is still enjoy many material </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileges.</v>

138
00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.090
<v Speaker 2>The subsidization system hasn't changed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the royal household.</v>

139
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.703
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The King of Saudi Arabia has ultra </v>

140
00:07:30.991 --> 00:07:35.250
<v Speaker 2>luxurious palaces all over the world </v>
<v Speaker 2>that are available to him in Marbella in</v>

141
00:07:35.251 --> 00:07:36.084
<v Speaker 2>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has l Roseo a palace inspired by no </v>

142
00:07:38.251 --> 00:07:39.360
<v Speaker 2>less than the White House.</v>

143
00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.500
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's gotta be pretty boring,</v>

144
00:07:45.501 --> 00:07:46.334
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have to go to the same palace all the </v>

145
00:07:47.331 --> 00:07:48.051
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

146
00:07:48.051 --> 00:07:48.884
<v Speaker 2>how tiresome so lost some of the king </v>
<v Speaker 2>built a new and gigantic palace in </v>

147
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:53.870
<v Speaker 2>Tangier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Morocco.</v>

148
00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.180
<v Speaker 2>The palace has its very own hospital in </v>
<v Speaker 2>here.</v>

149
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:59.570
<v Speaker 2>The king gets French seafood delivered </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct from France.</v>

150
00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:00.261
<v Speaker 2>But I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

151
00:08:00.261 --> 00:08:01.094
<v Speaker 2>what's the problem with chartering a few</v>
<v Speaker 2>airplanes so the king can eat some nice </v>

152
00:08:03.681 --> 00:08:05.120
<v Speaker 2>and lobsters?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

153
00:08:05.330 --> 00:08:06.021
<v Speaker 2>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>

154
00:08:06.021 --> 00:08:06.854
<v Speaker 2>when the king of Saudi Arabia travels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he travels and big and his last tour </v>

155
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:16.571
<v Speaker 2>around Asia in 2016 the king traveled </v>
<v Speaker 2>with 1500 people and he took with him to</v>

156
00:08:17.091 --> 00:08:17.924
<v Speaker 2>Mercedes Benz s 600 limousines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In order to carry it all 27 planes had </v>

157
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:23.830
<v Speaker 2>to be used.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

158
00:08:23.831 --> 00:08:26.170
<v Speaker 2>So it seems that this is what the royal </v>
<v Speaker 2>family,</v>

159
00:08:26.180 --> 00:08:29.420
<v Speaker 2>you can sit as austerity and the print </v>
<v Speaker 2>is our main character.</v>

160
00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:30.313
<v Speaker 2>He's no different either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During holidays in France and at the </v>

161
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 2>same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oil prices were falling.</v>

162
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:36.703
<v Speaker 2>Print.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salmaan saw the yacht of the Russian </v>

163
00:08:37.941 --> 00:08:39.410
<v Speaker 2>magnate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uri Sheffler.</v>

164
00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 2>It was love at first sight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He sent an assistant right away in order</v>

165
00:08:42.531 --> 00:08:43.364
<v Speaker 2>to close the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Solman bought it for 550 million US </v>

166
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

167
00:08:48.620 --> 00:08:50.910
<v Speaker 2>Now you know how the family likes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>live animals?</v>

168
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:53.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are quite a big family.</v>

169
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.103
<v Speaker 2>It's all estimations indicate that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi royal family has around 15,000 </v>

170
00:08:57.601 --> 00:08:58.434
<v Speaker 2>members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government has evaded the question </v>

171
00:08:59.581 --> 00:09:02.250
<v Speaker 2>of membership numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even low and estimates,</v>

172
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:03.084
<v Speaker 2>but it did about 5,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we're talking about people who live </v>

173
00:09:05.851 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 2>thanks to the public budget and to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>all kinds of privileges.</v>

174
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.253
<v Speaker 2>They are paid impressive salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have access to hospitals which are </v>

175
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.584
<v Speaker 2>essentially five star palaces ans they </v>
<v Speaker 2>do profitable business with the </v>

176
00:09:16.621 --> 00:09:19.950
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have incredibly luxurious spends,</v>

177
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 2>honestly rather incredible lifestyles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the reality is that that is very,</v>

178
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:27.990
<v Speaker 2>very expensive according to estimations </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the u s government.</v>

179
00:09:27.991 --> 00:09:30.690
<v Speaker 2>Since transparency is not a tradition in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the royal family of,</v>

180
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:31.524
<v Speaker 2>they spend about $2 billion every year </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to keep up their sumptuous </v>

181
00:09:35.521 --> 00:09:36.354
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other estimates indicate the royal </v>

182
00:09:40.401 --> 00:09:43.430
<v Speaker 2>family takes over a million barrels of </v>
<v Speaker 2>oil a day,</v>

183
00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:45.440
<v Speaker 2>which is 10% of the national production</v>

184
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.820
<v Speaker 2>progress of Saudi vision 2030</v>

185
00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.553
<v Speaker 2>this wanting to all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the transition of Saudi Arabia plans in </v>

186
00:09:55.691 --> 00:09:56.524
<v Speaker 2>vision 2030 keeps moving forward.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia designs a city of </v>

187
00:10:01.031 --> 00:10:04.170
<v Speaker 2>entertainment almost as big as Las Vegas</v>
<v Speaker 2>bosses.</v>

188
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:08.560
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that it is moving slowly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Adams for the time being Saudi Arabia is</v>

189
00:10:08.561 --> 00:10:11.230
<v Speaker 2>regaining better relations with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

190
00:10:11.260 --> 00:10:12.093
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Donald Trump's first international </v>

191
00:10:13.151 --> 00:10:15.370
<v Speaker 2>visitors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s presidents was to react.</v>

192
00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:16.263
<v Speaker 2>But yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to achieve that to the Saudis </v>

193
00:10:17.861 --> 00:10:22.861
<v Speaker 2>had to sign some pretty big checks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump signs the single largest arms deal</v>

194
00:10:23.381 --> 00:10:24.214
<v Speaker 2>in US history with Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're $350 billion and this has to be </v>

195
00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:29.734
<v Speaker 2>added to the billion dollar contracts </v>
<v Speaker 2>they already have with some of the </v>

196
00:10:32.021 --> 00:10:36.490
<v Speaker 2>largest companies in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it all has a target in mind.</v>

197
00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:37.353
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia wants to reinforce the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protection it has from the u s to </v>

198
00:10:40.391 --> 00:10:42.790
<v Speaker 2>defendant for impossible enemies such as</v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran.</v>

199
00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:43.683
<v Speaker 2>We're actually going to be discussing </v>
<v Speaker 2>this special relationship in a future </v>

00:10:45.641 --> 00:10:47.960
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so please do not forget to subscribe,</v>

201
00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.620
<v Speaker 2>but leaving the u s aside in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>few months,</v>

202
00:10:50.650 --> 00:10:55.150
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia has set the world's largest</v>
<v Speaker 2>funder for technological investments.</v>

203
00:10:55.210 --> 00:10:59.060
<v Speaker 2>They have $100 billion available to </v>
<v Speaker 2>invest further more.</v>

204
00:10:59.090 --> 00:10:59.923
<v Speaker 2>The country's eliminating many </v>
<v Speaker 2>restrictions on foreign investments and </v>

205
00:11:02.141 --> 00:11:04.330
<v Speaker 2>some projects are being already </v>
<v Speaker 2>discussed.</v>

206
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.210
<v Speaker 2>Some of these have already been put into</v>
<v Speaker 2>motion such as theme parks,</v>

207
00:11:07.211 --> 00:11:09.970
<v Speaker 2>huge hotel resorts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and even nuclear power plant</v>

208
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.050
<v Speaker 1>bus plus.</v>

209
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:13.883
<v Speaker 2>As we have been telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>transforming this country won't be easy </v>

210
00:11:16.891 --> 00:11:19.860
<v Speaker 2>at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is just the start of their very</v>

211
00:11:19.861 --> 00:11:20.694
<v Speaker 2>own soap opera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the huge money wastage of the </v>

212
00:11:22.441 --> 00:11:24.240
<v Speaker 2>royal family,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which means they have to deal with a lot</v>

213
00:11:24.241 --> 00:11:25.074
<v Speaker 2>of criticism from the country's powerful</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious leaders who by the way have a </v>

214
00:11:27.721 --> 00:11:29.580
<v Speaker 2>terrible lack of respect for civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights.</v>

215
00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:30.473
<v Speaker 2>Then there is the war in Yemen and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty of the air to the Saudi </v>

216
00:11:33.181 --> 00:11:34.014
<v Speaker 2>throne.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now what do you think about the </v>

217
00:11:35.281 --> 00:11:37.710
<v Speaker 2>luxurious lifestyle of the Saudi royal </v>
<v Speaker 2>family?</v>

218
00:11:37.770 --> 00:11:41.250
