1
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.860
<v Speaker 1>With over $95 million inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt is the biggest country in the Arab</v>

2
00:00:11.861 --> 00:00:16.080
<v Speaker 1>wells and yes I know what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking on Indonesia and Pakistan,</v>

3
00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>bigger than Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they Muslim to well,</v>

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.660
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all live yet,</v>

5
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:20.523
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a difference between Arab and </v>

6
00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Muslim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islam is simply a religion.</v>

7
00:00:25.091 --> 00:00:25.924
<v Speaker 1>While Arabic is a culture or race and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially a language inside this Arab </v>

8
00:00:34.011 --> 00:00:34.844
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt isn't only the most populous </v>

9
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:38.660
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most influential.</v>

10
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:39.613
<v Speaker 1>This is why the Arab League has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters on the Taquerias Square in </v>

11
00:00:42.261 --> 00:00:45.680
<v Speaker 1>the very center of Cairo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why news like this?</v>

12
00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.740
<v Speaker 1>It's like worrying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt rises to 300,</v>

13
00:00:51.961 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 1>five people in their deadliest terrorist</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

14
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.400
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the latest news,</v>

15
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Egypt is changing faster than we might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think,</v>

16
00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.633
<v Speaker 1>maybe urine under the Arab spring in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2011 thousands of people protested for </v>

17
00:01:03.301 --> 00:01:04.134
<v Speaker 1>days to overthrow a Haas Niamh Uber Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The dictator who ruled the country back </v>

18
00:01:07.351 --> 00:01:09.910
<v Speaker 1>then a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood gains power ready</v>

19
00:01:09.911 --> 00:01:12.510
<v Speaker 1>to defend the country into the pyramids </v>
<v Speaker 1>of an Islamic republic,</v>

20
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.433
<v Speaker 1>but now in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian politics off taking a 180 </v>

21
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.754
<v Speaker 1>degree shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gypsy government closes 27,000 mosques </v>

22
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.420
<v Speaker 1>to fight terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the question becomes,</v>

23
00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:27.283
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did we get here and Egypt of coming </v>

24
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.803
<v Speaker 1>a secular country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While today we're going to answer those </v>

25
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:32.870
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

26
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history</v>

27
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Muslim Brotherhood</v>

28
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.950
<v Speaker 1>that all three names here defined </v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt's history in the last 60 years.</v>

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.900
<v Speaker 1>NASA,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadat and Mubarak,</v>

30
00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>these three politicians have a common </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients.</v>

31
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.490
<v Speaker 1>They will all dictators that fully the </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles of Arab socialism.</v>

32
00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>This was the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ideology back then,</v>

33
00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>our cocktail that combined a centralized</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

34
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.790
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian leadership and secularism </v>
<v Speaker 1>must make a mistake because socialist as</v>

35
00:02:02.791 --> 00:02:03.624
<v Speaker 1>they claim to be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of these needles had any problem </v>

36
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:09.720
<v Speaker 1>with changing their rubles into dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as the Soviet Union disappeared.</v>

37
00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sadat recognize the state of Israel ends</v>

38
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.380
<v Speaker 1>during the 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt was already an ally of America,</v>

39
00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:21.423
<v Speaker 1>and as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>befriending America in this part of the </v>

40
00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>world puts you on the radical Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bullseye.</v>

41
00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>This is why Uber Mubarak prosecuted </v>
<v Speaker 1>every Islamic movement.</v>

42
00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.273
<v Speaker 1>Part of this repression was to avoid the</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attacks that became pretty </v>

43
00:02:32.801 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 1>frequent in the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but uber and also had other motivations.</v>

44
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:37.803
<v Speaker 1>He wanted to stop any potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge to his authoritarian rule and </v>

45
00:02:40.961 --> 00:02:41.794
<v Speaker 1>guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You the only organized group here at </v>

46
00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.760
<v Speaker 1>replacing was well and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the Muslim Brotherhood.</v>

47
00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Despite being a client destined movement</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1954,</v>

48
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:49.743
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood is the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>organized grassroots organization sense </v>

49
00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.680
<v Speaker 1>Egypt's independence</v>

50
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.793
<v Speaker 2>today,</v>

51
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.953
<v Speaker 1>thousands of members and millions of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is to turn Egypt into an Islamic </v>

52
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.140
<v Speaker 1>republic compliant with Sharia Law and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the principles of the Koran.</v>

53
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.273
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim Brotherhood isn't the only </v>

54
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:08.854
<v Speaker 1>radical group in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here we can also find the Salafist </v>

55
00:03:11.231 --> 00:03:13.720
<v Speaker 1>superseded the same goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by different means.</v>

56
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.880
<v Speaker 1>The guys you see on the screen now then </v>
<v Speaker 1>was an brothers,</v>

57
00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they dress in a very western fashion,</v>

58
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

59
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Now these other guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the Salafist members,</v>

60
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.310
<v Speaker 1>do you see the difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salafi have traditional Muslim clothes,</v>

61
00:03:29.311 --> 00:03:30.144
<v Speaker 1>beard sounds the every bar on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreheads is created after hitting the </v>

62
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:34.890
<v Speaker 1>ground so many times while praying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mecca.</v>

63
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

64
00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.130
<v Speaker 1>As you can probably figure it out from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the name,</v>

65
00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:43.680
<v Speaker 1>the Salafi is wanting to live long.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first Muslims,</v>

66
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:45.330
<v Speaker 1>the Socorro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salafi did.</v>

67
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.283
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Muslim brothers are way more </v>

68
00:03:46.921 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 1>pragmatic in better organized than </v>
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>

69
00:03:49.111 --> 00:03:49.944
<v Speaker 1>infiltrate government institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have no problem disclosing </v>

70
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:55.110
<v Speaker 1>their intentions when they speak to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western media.</v>

71
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.613
<v Speaker 1>We are not terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Muslim Brotherhood's philosophies </v>

72
00:04:02.691 --> 00:04:03.524
<v Speaker 1>inspired by an understanding of Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>that emphasizes the values of social </v>

73
00:04:07.011 --> 00:04:08.330
<v Speaker 1>justice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality,</v>

74
00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.770
<v Speaker 1>and the rule of law God dot spokesperson</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Muslim Brotherhood.</v>

75
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.633
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the salaries and the Muslim </v>

76
00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.840
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood have the same goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but different strategies.</v>

77
00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:18.793
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the salar fists have a political party </v>

78
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:21.044
<v Speaker 1>you called our nor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this has nothing to do with the </v>

79
00:04:23.031 --> 00:04:25.220
<v Speaker 1>Muslim brothers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine.</v>

80
00:04:25.221 --> 00:04:27.680
<v Speaker 1>The radicals don't like each other very </v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

81
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:28.553
<v Speaker 1>Remember this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we will come back to it later </v>

82
00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.060
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the 19 eighties,</v>

83
00:04:32.061 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Speaker 1>the military dictatorship of Hosni </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mubarak attacked both of these groups.</v>

84
00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:37.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the year 1981,</v>

85
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.743
<v Speaker 1>Egypt has been in a neverending state of</v>
<v Speaker 1>emergency where every political </v>

86
00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:43.610
<v Speaker 1>dissident is sent to jail.</v>

87
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.800
<v Speaker 1>This means thousands of fists and Muslim</v>
<v Speaker 1>brothers spending decades behind bars,</v>

88
00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.823
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither the European Union nor the </v>

89
00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:00.770
<v Speaker 1>United States did anything to stop this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

90
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.860
<v Speaker 1>nobody wanted to see the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>radicals in the government.</v>

91
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.290
<v Speaker 1>If this was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the young Kapoor,</v>

92
00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.740
<v Speaker 1>warm Egypt had become a good ally of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel and their economy,</v>

93
00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.630
<v Speaker 1>it was on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

94
00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.710
<v Speaker 1>This country has all the ingredients for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world class tourism industry,</v>

95
00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.420
<v Speaker 1>the Pyramids denial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the desert,</v>

96
00:05:17.421 --> 00:05:20.270
<v Speaker 1>the Red Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say that by the year 2000,</v>

97
00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:21.133
<v Speaker 1>you couldn't label yourself a traveler </v>
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't have an Egyptian stamp on </v>

98
00:05:24.291 --> 00:05:25.124
<v Speaker 1>your passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for 30 years and had a free pass to </v>

99
00:05:27.841 --> 00:05:30.230
<v Speaker 1>rule Egypt that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait just a second,</v>

100
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>because in 2011 things really changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>our signals,</v>

101
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:37.933
<v Speaker 1>Egypt succession by taking someone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington news only exist when made </v>

102
00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>both the citizens and some factions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the army.</v>

103
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Equally enraged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a dictator is one thing.</v>

104
00:05:45.351 --> 00:05:48.410
<v Speaker 1>Having a hereditary density of power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite another.</v>

105
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.100
<v Speaker 1>This is how the Arab spring canes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egypt's and why Mubarak out to resign,</v>

106
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.620
<v Speaker 1>a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parliamentary ends.</v>

107
00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:54.463
<v Speaker 1>Presidential elections were held.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a country that has </v>

108
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.033
<v Speaker 1>decades under a dictatorship where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only strong political movements other </v>

109
00:06:02.121 --> 00:06:05.480
<v Speaker 1>than the government itself by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood.</v>

110
00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>So I guess he won those elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

111
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 1>it was the Muslim Brotherhood led by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>guy you see on the screen.</v>

112
00:06:10.491 --> 00:06:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mohammed,</v>

113
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.660
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute because things are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>more complex unless you are Saudi Arabia</v>

114
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:26.260
<v Speaker 1>and you are sitting on a pile of soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Radical Islam isn't good for managing an</v>

115
00:06:26.261 --> 00:06:27.094
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in less than one year Egypt's </v>

116
00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:30.310
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it absolutely sank.</v>

117
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.540
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of people lost their jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation skyrockets.</v>

118
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.190
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly his main goal was to Islam as the</v>

119
00:06:36.191 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 1>government stop the division of power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and shield his own power.</v>

120
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Then you've got to add into this </v>
<v Speaker 1>equation,</v>

121
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 1>the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>

122
00:06:42.341 --> 00:06:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian defense forces on new big fan </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Islamist groups,</v>

123
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:47.890
<v Speaker 1>and this is how when you play,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I came into the picture,</v>

124
00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Marshall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Abigail,</v>

125
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.700
<v Speaker 1>fertile cc was the head of the Egyptian </v>
<v Speaker 1>armed forces.</v>

126
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:00.033
<v Speaker 1>He met the leaders of the opposing </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties including the Salafist and </v>

127
00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>basically said something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

128
00:07:03.941 --> 00:07:05.290
<v Speaker 1>so Doug Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he and his friends,</v>

129
00:07:05.291 --> 00:07:06.124
<v Speaker 1>they're really screwing up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government's help me set to the </v>

130
00:07:07.401 --> 00:07:11.080
<v Speaker 1>candidates are and we can put things </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in order and as we say here,</v>

131
00:07:11.081 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As it was said Sir,</v>

132
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:18.051
<v Speaker 1>it was done land of the pharaohs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the year 2013,</v>

133
00:07:19.391 --> 00:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian army kicked mostly out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the governments.</v>

134
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:22.773
<v Speaker 1>That's as policy was to make the Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brotherhood and illegal organization </v>

135
00:07:25.511 --> 00:07:26.320
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

136
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.153
<v Speaker 1>protesters went to the streets and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of them died and thousands of </v>

137
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:30.634
<v Speaker 1>them were sent to jail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in June of 2014 new elections were </v>

138
00:07:34.301 --> 00:07:35.134
<v Speaker 1>held,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I say elections there because there </v>

139
00:07:36.761 --> 00:07:37.594
<v Speaker 1>was virtually a single candidate I'll cc</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he managed to get 97 percent of the </v>

140
00:07:41.801 --> 00:07:42.634
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>

141
00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:50.490
<v Speaker 1>The other except candidate was a guy </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a zero percent chance of winning,</v>

142
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:51.324
<v Speaker 1>called Habonim some bar heap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He got the other three percent of the </v>

143
00:07:53.731 --> 00:07:54.960
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you've seen the movie,</v>

144
00:07:54.961 --> 00:07:56.490
<v Speaker 1>the Dark Knight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's this amazing quote,</v>

145
00:07:56.491 --> 00:07:57.324
<v Speaker 1>it says you either die a hero or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>live long enough to see yourself become </v>

146
00:07:59.821 --> 00:08:00.870
<v Speaker 1>the villain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

147
00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.990
<v Speaker 1>this could have been coined by LCC </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

148
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:05.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last few years,</v>

149
00:08:05.820 --> 00:08:06.653
<v Speaker 1>Egypt has become the world's number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader in people given the death </v>

150
00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:11.370
<v Speaker 1>penalty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not only that,</v>

151
00:08:11.371 --> 00:08:12.204
<v Speaker 1>in just three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government has closed over 27,000 </v>

152
00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:15.324
<v Speaker 1>mosques further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no freedom of speech </v>

153
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:22.670
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

154
00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:25.754
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Islamic fanatics are pretty angry </v>

155
00:08:27.771 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:08:28.730 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>actually the opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember how I said that?</v>

157
00:08:31.401 --> 00:08:34.040
<v Speaker 1>The Salafist and the Muslim Brothers </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't good friends?</v>

158
00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:36.470
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was definitely not kidding about that.</v>

159
00:08:40.530 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>You should ultra conservative Islam a </v>
<v Speaker 1>back isis,</v>

160
00:08:43.430 --> 00:08:44.263
<v Speaker 1>seek to eclipse brotherhood bots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait just a minute because things are </v>

161
00:08:46.761 --> 00:08:48.380
<v Speaker 1>not good for the Salafist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See them.</v>

162
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:54.073
<v Speaker 1>Of course lcc gave them enough so they </v>
<v Speaker 1>could fill the roles left by the Muslim </v>

163
00:08:57.451 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 1>brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but those Egyptian believers,</v>

164
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:00.264
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to go to a mosque,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to go to those controlled by the </v>

165
00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>oil as hot emanates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is under government to control,</v>

166
00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:09.750
<v Speaker 1>but you know what the biggest problem is</v>
<v Speaker 1>here that are less and less believers in</v>

167
00:09:09.751 --> 00:09:10.584
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The percentage of youngsters who pray </v>

168
00:09:11.921 --> 00:09:14.130
<v Speaker 1>daily has halved in less than $5.</v>

169
00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.633
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

170
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:21.130
<v Speaker 1>a barometer in the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011,</v>

171
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:26.430
<v Speaker 1>84 percent of the population supported </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sharia law influencing politics in 2016,</v>

172
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:30.040
<v Speaker 1>that percentage fell to 34 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

173
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:30.933
<v Speaker 1>I'll cc himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>celebrates the Christian Christmas in </v>

174
00:09:32.741 --> 00:09:35.230
<v Speaker 1>the Coptic Cathedral of Kairos year </v>
<v Speaker 1>after year.</v>

175
00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.150
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Egyptian society,</v>

176
00:09:37.330 --> 00:09:40.300
<v Speaker 1>that's becoming more and more secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before you get too excited,</v>

177
00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:43.690
<v Speaker 1>wait just a moment because this could </v>
<v Speaker 1>change at any moments.</v>

178
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:47.110
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lccs popularity fell in 2017.</v>

179
00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:48.033
<v Speaker 1>A good share of Egyptians do not like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that he gave Saudi Arabia </v>

180
00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:52.690
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty over two islands in the red </v>
<v Speaker 1>seat.</v>

181
00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:54.700
<v Speaker 1>They also don't like the repression </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

182
00:09:54.820 --> 00:09:55.750
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>newsline,</v>

183
00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:56.613
<v Speaker 1>this kind of resembles x time clair </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of emergency after deadly church </v>

184
00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:06.870
<v Speaker 1>attacks on the other hands that your </v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy is most Egyptians named worry.</v>

185
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:08.880
<v Speaker 1>Despite the unemployment rate's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down,</v>

186
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:12.360
<v Speaker 1>it's still over 12 percent and these are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the official figures.</v>

187
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Some experts say that it might be over </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 and displayed all of this.</v>

188
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:21.170
<v Speaker 1>The government is working on pharaoh </v>
<v Speaker 1>like projects Egypt to build new capital</v>

189
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:26.220
<v Speaker 1>paid for by China after this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the terrorist attacks,</v>

190
00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.790
<v Speaker 1>and we can only conclude the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:30.420

<v Speaker 1>succeeding.</v>

192
00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.463
<v Speaker 1>So now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe Egypt's can turn into a </v>

193
00:10:37.211 --> 00:10:39.160
<v Speaker 1>secular country the way neighboring tune</v>
