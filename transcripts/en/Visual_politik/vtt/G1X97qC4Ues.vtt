1
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's don't today's video with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

2
00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Which country would you say is the US?</v>
<v Speaker 1>His biggest ally is a Canada.</v>

3
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.040
<v Speaker 1>Maybe it's the UK as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about Israel?</v>

4
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not an easy question.</v>

5
00:00:18.811 --> 00:00:19.644
<v Speaker 1>Zones are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it definitely depends on who you </v>

6
00:00:21.041 --> 00:00:21.874
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whether that is a country which has </v>

7
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:25.050
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's aligns with the U.</v>

8
00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:25.884
<v Speaker 1>s a great deal over the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has improved enough that it is for </v>

9
00:00:29.041 --> 00:00:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best friend of the country,</v>

10
00:00:31.171 --> 00:00:34.740
<v Speaker 1>its biggest ally more so than any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.070
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not Canada and the UK or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>

12
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.993
<v Speaker 1>It is Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country of Surf Kangaroos and the </v>

13
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.673
<v Speaker 1>Sydney Opera House.</v>

14
00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.810
<v Speaker 1>Surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you shouldn't be.</v>

15
00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>Australia is Devi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are the only country in the world to</v>

16
00:00:51.841 --> 00:00:54.830
<v Speaker 1>have fought with the US in all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big Wars,</v>

17
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.280
<v Speaker 1>World War One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II,</v>

18
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

19
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>the Gulf War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan,</v>

20
00:00:58.231 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we'll see the operations against</v>

21
00:01:00.961 --> 00:01:02.310
<v Speaker 1>isis for the bends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

22
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:04.930
<v Speaker 1>we could almost say that Australia is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the USA.</v>

23
00:01:04.931 --> 00:01:08.970
<v Speaker 1>What these score is to Imovie and at </v>
<v Speaker 1>first might go unnoticed,</v>

24
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:09.804
<v Speaker 1>but remove that music and you can see </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it's really something that's going </v>

25
00:01:13.021 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>to be missed on January the 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

26
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:17.194
<v Speaker 1>and despite this old alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump decided to hang up the </v>

27
00:01:19.891 --> 00:01:23.010
<v Speaker 1>phone on Malcolm Turnbull,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia's prime minister,</v>

28
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.700
<v Speaker 1>not just that though before we told him </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get lost and hung up on him at trump,</v>

29
00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.800
<v Speaker 1>accused him of trying to export </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>

30
00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:29.643
<v Speaker 1>do the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this was all just about a slight </v>

31
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>disagreement that these two countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>had over 1000,</v>

32
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>250 refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's the story that we're going to</v>

33
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:39.330
<v Speaker 1>get into another day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

34
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.193
<v Speaker 1>this brief diplomatic tussle might not </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem like that much in the grand scheme </v>

35
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:46.020
<v Speaker 1>of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has had a lot of consequences.</v>

36
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.883
<v Speaker 1>Many Australians are left wondering if </v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't time to start cooling off the </v>

37
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spike just listen.</v>

38
00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.603
<v Speaker 1>Well naturally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something we started wondering </v>

39
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:01.334
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It raises questions like how important </v>

40
00:02:03.111 --> 00:02:07.040
<v Speaker 1>is Australia for the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 1>was it really sensible for trump to hang</v>

41
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 1>up the phone on his greatest ally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of consequences?</v>

42
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 1>Is this going to have for him?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.990
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shall we time for Asia,</v>

44
00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.630
<v Speaker 1>probably not news to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you've been following this</v>

45
00:02:22.631 --> 00:02:24.910
<v Speaker 1>channel for a while else has changed </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

46
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Both the political and economic power </v>
<v Speaker 1>centers are moving quickly to Asia,</v>

47
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.011
<v Speaker 1>like 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

48
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:30.844
<v Speaker 1>It is expected that more than half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's economy and population will </v>

49
00:02:33.491 --> 00:02:38.491
<v Speaker 1>be located in this continence and China </v>
<v Speaker 1>is emerging as a new superpower as well.</v>

50
00:02:38.981 --> 00:02:39.814
<v Speaker 1>That's a fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been told now a map of the world </v>

51
00:02:41.531 --> 00:02:42.970
<v Speaker 1>has looked pretty close to</v>

52
00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 2>why</v>

53
00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.180
<v Speaker 1>from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see things looking closer</v>

54
00:02:50.181 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 1>and closer to this.</v>

55
00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:53.920
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you</v>

56
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.350
<v Speaker 1>can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe is leaving the center of the Weld</v>

57
00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.360
<v Speaker 1>Indians taking up a position in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>

58
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that's a fun comparison,</v>

59
00:03:00.131 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>but we come really denied that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's changing.</v>

60
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's where you've been living this whole</v>

61
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.860
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 20th century.</v>

62
00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.230
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be Asia's century </v>
<v Speaker 1>something.</v>

63
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.860
<v Speaker 1>We've discussed a bunch of visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic that is my former US president,</v>

64
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:15.694
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama decided to bet strongly on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia and make this continent is top </v>

65
00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:20.014
<v Speaker 1>priority for American diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was under these circumstances that </v>

66
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Australia became such a valuable </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

67
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>but how close is this friendship between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US and Australia?</v>

68
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.660
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a place to look.</v>

69
00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:31.523
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

70
00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>Big Alliance,</v>

71
00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:39.413
<v Speaker 1>November of 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama and Australia's prime </v>

72
00:03:41.611 --> 00:03:42.444
<v Speaker 1>minister at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Julio Guillaune signing military </v>

73
00:03:44.251 --> 00:03:45.084
<v Speaker 1>agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant a new era for military </v>

74
00:03:46.831 --> 00:03:50.810
<v Speaker 1>cooperation between these two countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could always say that this new treaty</v>

75
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.540
<v Speaker 1>started a military friendship between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US and Australia.</v>

76
00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.880
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the description.</v>

77
00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:57.714
<v Speaker 1>The New York Times wrote about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement agreement with Australia and </v>

78
00:04:01.661 --> 00:04:02.494
<v Speaker 1>mounts the first longterm expansion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American military presence in the </v>

79
00:04:05.611 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Pacific since the end of the Vietnam War</v>
<v Speaker 1>bus.</v>

80
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:09.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did this agreements,</v>

81
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:11.430
<v Speaker 1>what did it really mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

82
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>for starters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the treaty,</v>

83
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:17.580
<v Speaker 1>the US can deploy a floating force of up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to 2,500 soldiers in Australia.</v>

84
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:18.443
<v Speaker 1>These treats are from the Marine Corps </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they are able to quickly deploy it </v>

85
00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.863
<v Speaker 1>in the event of any conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't think that this is the end of </v>

86
00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.883
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the collaboration between these </v>

87
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:27.384
<v Speaker 1>two countries has grown and grown,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has grown enough to become an </v>

88
00:04:29.371 --> 00:04:32.970
<v Speaker 1>essential relationship for Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not just the marines.</v>

89
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.833
<v Speaker 1>The United States wants to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia the key home base for their </v>

90
00:04:36.271 --> 00:04:39.020
<v Speaker 1>activities in both the Pacific and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian Ocean.</v>

91
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.363
<v Speaker 1>Now you're probably getting the idea the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US wants to have access to landing </v>

92
00:04:47.041 --> 00:04:49.050
<v Speaker 1>strips situated in the north of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

93
00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.960
<v Speaker 1>From here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to be able to deploy B,</v>

94
00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>two and B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>52 bombers.</v>

95
00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:53.663
<v Speaker 1>They also sent out a large naval base </v>
<v Speaker 1>near path for their enormous fleet of </v>

96
00:04:56.971 --> 00:04:59.130
<v Speaker 1>nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>sub</v>

97
00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.973
<v Speaker 2>marines</v>

98
00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.203
<v Speaker 1>and there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is also trying to </v>

99
00:05:09.011 --> 00:05:09.844
<v Speaker 1>locate and monitoring centers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>missile launch warning facilities that </v>

100
00:05:12.521 --> 00:05:15.850
<v Speaker 1>to even once he rents parts of the Coco </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands in the Indian Ocean,</v>

101
00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.810
<v Speaker 1>which an Australian sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might now be thinking,</v>

102
00:05:19.811 --> 00:05:20.644
<v Speaker 1>what do you need?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why would the United States wants to </v>

103
00:05:22.031 --> 00:05:24.880
<v Speaker 1>rent some random remote islands in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian Ocean?</v>

104
00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is actually pretty clear.</v>

105
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.663
<v Speaker 1>The US wants to locate to their long </v>
<v Speaker 1>range surveillance aircrafts and armed </v>

106
00:05:30.701 --> 00:05:34.150
<v Speaker 1>drones on the Coco Islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also wanted to use this archipelago</v>

107
00:05:34.151 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>as another deployment center for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombers in case of war,</v>

108
00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.880
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there is still more,</v>

109
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:40.743
<v Speaker 1>the United States wants to improve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration between their army and the </v>

110
00:05:43.811 --> 00:05:48.010
<v Speaker 1>Australian military so that the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces could work together whenever need</v>

111
00:05:48.011 --> 00:05:48.670
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

112
00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:51.550
<v Speaker 1>if you don't exactly understand what the</v>
<v Speaker 1>results of this could be,</v>

113
00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.190
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do consider this in the last few years,</v>

114
00:05:54.191 --> 00:05:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Australia has carried out a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>renovation of them military equipment.</v>

115
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.143
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about purchase contracts </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth billions and billions of dollars </v>

116
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 1>and among these there is quite a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American material.</v>

117
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>Take the controversial f 35 as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

118
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>Australia has committed to buying 72 </v>
<v Speaker 1>units,</v>

119
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.473
<v Speaker 1>which is going to cost $19,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a serious amount of cash and </v>

120
00:06:16.231 --> 00:06:17.064
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the country with a </v>

121
00:06:17.541 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>little more than 24 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like per person.</v>

122
00:06:20.841 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>It's really a lot of money.</v>

123
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:26.563
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you've got to be wondering why </v>

124
00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

125
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.733
<v Speaker 1>Well that's for several reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First because both countries are </v>

126
00:06:33.321 --> 00:06:35.510
<v Speaker 1>culturally similar and as we've said </v>
<v Speaker 1>before,</v>

127
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:36.344
<v Speaker 1>they fought together and many times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds it's because Australia's </v>

128
00:06:39.111 --> 00:06:43.910
<v Speaker 1>geographical position is almost perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's situated between the Indian and the</v>

129
00:06:43.911 --> 00:06:44.744
<v Speaker 1>Pacific oceans and it is close enough to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hot spots in Asia that the US could </v>

130
00:06:48.381 --> 00:06:52.310
<v Speaker 1>carry out attacks and deploy troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>there quickly and last but not least,</v>

131
00:06:52.311 --> 00:06:56.150
<v Speaker 1>there's another important factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is an important energy,</v>

132
00:06:56.151 --> 00:06:58.390
<v Speaker 1>raw material and food suppliers or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trynna,</v>

133
00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:01.340
<v Speaker 1>so it depends again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believes that in the event of a conflict</v>

134
00:07:01.341 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>or tough tensions between the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

135
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>it would be convenient to have control </v>
<v Speaker 1>over Australia.</v>

136
00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:07.070
<v Speaker 1>I'd say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

137
00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:07.903
<v Speaker 1>what about the other side?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do the Australians once they </v>

138
00:07:10.341 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>basically understand that the US can </v>
<v Speaker 1>sort of be an insurance policy,</v>

139
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:19.300
<v Speaker 1>no way to ensure their own safety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some voices who disagree,</v>

140
00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.123
<v Speaker 1>these voices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be growing louder and </v>

141
00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:28.053
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump hasn't helped with his whole </v>

142
00:07:29.081 --> 00:07:29.914
<v Speaker 1>hanging up the phone</v>

143
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.883
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

144
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:34.450
<v Speaker 3>That Chinese alternative</v>

145
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:37.490
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

146
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:40.850
<v Speaker 1>It is by far the largest trade partner </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Australia.</v>

147
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:43.910
<v Speaker 1>It is the first destination for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia's exports.</v>

148
00:07:43.911 --> 00:07:44.744
<v Speaker 1>It's the country of origin for many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the immigrants coming to Australia and </v>

149
00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.403
<v Speaker 1>besides that on more and more Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who visit the country every year </v>

150
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.513
<v Speaker 1>who have decided to study that anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese mean a lot of money for the </v>

151
00:07:56.301 --> 00:07:59.510
<v Speaker 1>Australian and well that has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

152
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.113
<v Speaker 3>A 2016 survey conducted by the Public </v>
<v Speaker 3>Policy Group Lowy Institute asked </v>

153
00:08:04.731 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 3>respondents to identify the country that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was more important to Australia.</v>

154
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:12.710
<v Speaker 3>Forty three percent chose the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States and 43 percent China in 2014,</v>

155
00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.573
<v Speaker 3>48 percent had answered the United </v>
<v Speaker 3>States and only 37 percent had chosen </v>

156
00:08:16.701 --> 00:08:18.850
<v Speaker 3>China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>New York Times and look</v>

157
00:08:18.950 --> 00:08:19.783
<v Speaker 1>under 45 year olds clearly have opted </v>
<v Speaker 1>for China and almost half of the </v>

158
00:08:23.061 --> 00:08:23.894
<v Speaker 1>country's population believed their </v>
<v Speaker 1>country should keep some distance from </v>

159
00:08:26.631 --> 00:08:30.080
<v Speaker 1>trump's America book eating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>important Australian x prime minister,</v>

160
00:08:30.081 --> 00:08:31.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the personalities.</v>

161
00:08:31.881 --> 00:08:32.714
<v Speaker 1>He thinks it would be best at trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve relations with China and less </v>

162
00:08:35.661 --> 00:08:36.494
<v Speaker 1>relations with the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cooled down a bit and pay particular </v>

163
00:08:39.441 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>attention to how he explains his.</v>

164
00:08:42.770 --> 00:08:46.070
<v Speaker 3>The Society of artists is a better </v>
<v Speaker 3>society than the United States.</v>

165
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.720
<v Speaker 3>It's more even.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's more fair.</v>

166
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:51.650
<v Speaker 3>We've had a 50 percent increase in real </v>
<v Speaker 3>incomes in the last 20 years.</v>

167
00:08:51.710 --> 00:08:54.860
<v Speaker 3>Media in America has had zero zero for </v>
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

168
00:08:54.870 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 3>Australia has made some</v>

169
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>kinds of gestures towards the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>giants.</v>

170
00:08:58.350 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>As an example of when spanaway </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington didn't like this at all,</v>

171
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:04.470
<v Speaker 1>the country decided to participate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Asian infrastructure.</v>

172
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:05.304
<v Speaker 1>Investment Bank and institution led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>China whose aim is to increase China's </v>

173
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.774
<v Speaker 1>influence in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Australian government itself has </v>

174
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:12.534
<v Speaker 1>made it clear that China is above all a </v>
<v Speaker 1>source for opportunities for the </v>

175
00:09:15.961 --> 00:09:17.290
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily for trump though,</v>

176
00:09:17.350 --> 00:09:20.730
<v Speaker 1>there are still many things that protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>his relationship with Australia,</v>

177
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:27.390
<v Speaker 1>American culture and the fear of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>

178
00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.620
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

179
00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:32.453
<v Speaker 1>I'm the US all politically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>culturally and economically similar </v>

180
00:09:35.361 --> 00:09:37.040
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are so similar.</v>

181
00:09:37.041 --> 00:09:37.874
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's an international level that it </v>

182
00:09:38.841 --> 00:09:39.674
<v Speaker 1>could be argued that Australia is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than an extension of the </v>

183
00:09:42.171 --> 00:09:43.004
<v Speaker 1>American lifestyle in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that a lot of </v>

184
00:09:45.141 --> 00:09:47.240
<v Speaker 1>Australians are pretty proud to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered</v>

185
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.073
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>

186
00:09:49.140 --> 00:09:49.973
<v Speaker 1>Whatever happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I will not tell my affection for the </v>

187
00:09:51.571 --> 00:09:55.380
<v Speaker 1>American people and the best of American</v>
<v Speaker 1>culture that was not raised in America,</v>

188
00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>but I was raised in the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

189
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 1>I have not yet ready to say goodbye Lisa</v>
<v Speaker 1>prior.</v>

190
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.643
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States is still the largest </v>

191
00:10:03.451 --> 00:10:07.710
<v Speaker 1>investor in Australia and investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that exceeds $500,000,000,000.</v>

192
00:10:07.810 --> 00:10:08.643
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

193
00:10:09.420 --> 00:10:10.253
<v Speaker 1>mostly the fact that China is still a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship is making Australia </v>

194
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:13.644
<v Speaker 1>suspicious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many simply don't trust Beijing's </v>

195
00:10:15.510 --> 00:10:16.710
<v Speaker 1>intentions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

196
00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:17.573
<v Speaker 1>the government has stopped and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese investments operations that </v>

197
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:20.664
<v Speaker 1>intended to buy land in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we can't say that it kind of all of </v>

198
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:25.830
<v Speaker 1>indicates that the alliance with theu s </v>
<v Speaker 1>will continue,</v>

199
00:10:25.831 --> 00:10:26.664
<v Speaker 1>but the Australians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while there are very practical people </v>

200
00:10:28.351 --> 00:10:29.184
<v Speaker 1>and they have made it clear that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to be affected by a future </v>

201
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:35.280
<v Speaker 1>hypothetical war of power between China </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the United States.</v>

202
00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:35.731
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

203
00:10:35.731 --> 00:10:37.280
<v Speaker 1>that's what we think here at visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic,</v>

204
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.910
<v Speaker 1>and now we'd love to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

205
00:10:38.911 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the United States will </v>
<v Speaker 1>despise trump,</v>

206
00:10:41.371 --> 00:10:42.204
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>carry out the projects they had planned </v>

207
00:10:43.141 --> 00:10:43.974
<v Speaker 1>to do in Australia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or do you think China will achieve more </v>

208
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:47.810
<v Speaker 1>and more influence in the country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

209
00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:48.683
<v Speaker 1>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would you feel if trump hung up the </v>

210
00:10:50.131 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>phone on your country's leader?</v>
