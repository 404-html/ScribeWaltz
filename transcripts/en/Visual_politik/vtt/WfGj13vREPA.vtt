1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.280
<v Speaker 1>There's a country that always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

2
00:00:02.281 --> 00:00:03.114
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>always appears in the headlines of </v>

3
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:07.080
<v Speaker 1>international newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's for two main reasons why one of</v>

4
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:09.390
<v Speaker 1>them soccer and the other is economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>The problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my friends lately,</v>

6
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.270
<v Speaker 1>these headlines on having more to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with crises on the football,</v>

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>I am of course talking about Argentina.</v>

8
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

9
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.053
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Argentina is a country that is as </v>

10
00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:31.400
<v Speaker 1>allergic to reforms as it is addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>crises.</v>

11
00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:36.200
<v Speaker 1>When everything seemed to be going well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 suddenly became very,</v>

12
00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:38.940
<v Speaker 1>very complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much so that we're ECO Macra,</v>

13
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.830
<v Speaker 1>he's governments has been forced to to </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask for a bailout from the international</v>

14
00:00:42.831 --> 00:00:43.664
<v Speaker 1>monetary funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be thinking really a </v>

15
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 1>bailout Argentina again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard it right.</v>

17
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.163
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country of tango is back on the </v>

18
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:55.160
<v Speaker 1>ropes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so listen up.</v>

19
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

20
00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.730
<v Speaker 1>April and May of 2018 haven't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>been great months for Argentina.</v>

21
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:16.653
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

22
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.380
<v Speaker 3>That condition and </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]. [inaudible]</v>

23
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's who we ended up.</v>

24
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.580
<v Speaker 3>Sandy [inaudible] are the basis the </v>
<v Speaker 3>American,</v>

25
00:01:32.581 --> 00:01:33.414
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

26
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.443
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>

27
00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:36.653
<v Speaker 1>And just a few weeks of pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was depreciated by 20% going from </v>

28
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:41.124
<v Speaker 1>an exchange rate of one US dollar for 20</v>
<v Speaker 1>pesos to an exchange rate of $1 getting </v>

29
00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 1>you 25 pesos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

30
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.013
<v Speaker 1>There's not exactly surprising since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of 2018 Argentina's currency </v>

31
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.770
<v Speaker 1>has depreciated by at 25% and if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>extended that time frame to five years,</v>

32
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.360
<v Speaker 1>could you guess how much the peso has </v>
<v Speaker 1>depreciated since then?</v>

33
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that it's been an </v>

34
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.610
<v Speaker 1>absolutely brutal 80% appreciation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake as though the plummeting</v>

35
00:02:23.671 --> 00:02:26.190
<v Speaker 1>exchange rate isn't the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the consequence</v>

36
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:28.543
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>

37
00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:33.570
<v Speaker 1>you Argentina's real problem lies in its</v>
<v Speaker 1>addiction to public spending.</v>

38
00:02:33.721 --> 00:02:34.554
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not saying the public spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>is slightly higher than they can afford </v>

39
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.214
<v Speaker 1>here after they have such high public </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending that Argentina simply has no </v>

40
00:02:42.301 --> 00:02:43.350
<v Speaker 1>ability to afford it.</v>

41
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

42
00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:45.363
<v Speaker 4>In the last 57 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we spent 53 years with the state </v>

43
00:02:48.671 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 4>spending more than it collects.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is with the fiscal deficits.</v>

44
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 4>And during those 53 years,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we had four huge crises.</v>

45
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.990
<v Speaker 4>Now we're fighting to avoid a fifth one,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Jose Luis,</v>

46
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 4>Bert and Argentine</v>

47
00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.383
<v Speaker 1>economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know what you might be thinking </v>

48
00:03:03.671 --> 00:03:05.050
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably thinking,</v>

49
00:03:05.051 --> 00:03:05.884
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell does public spending have </v>

50
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:10.330
<v Speaker 1>to do with the pcs depreciation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:03:10.331 --> 00:03:14.470
<v Speaker 1>actually much more than you'd think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's go through it step by step.</v>

52
00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.470
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is facing eight triple time </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>

53
00:03:28.471 --> 00:03:32.280
<v Speaker 1>It has a huge external deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge public deficits,</v>

54
00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:37.310
<v Speaker 1>and $250 billion of external desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

55
00:03:37.531 --> 00:03:38.364
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the deficits and the dads have to </v>

56
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:41.244
<v Speaker 1>be paid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's where that first big problem </v>

57
00:03:43.651 --> 00:03:46.290
<v Speaker 1>appears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is,</v>

58
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>and he is a protectionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devaluations,</v>

59
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:51.810
<v Speaker 1>hyper regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and very high taxes.</v>

60
00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:52.673
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is one of the countries with </v>

61
00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:57.090
<v Speaker 1>the highest business taxes on the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

62
00:03:59.210 --> 00:04:00.360
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this has stopped.</v>

63
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.180
<v Speaker 1>The industry ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Argentine economy in general,</v>

64
00:04:03.181 --> 00:04:06.020
<v Speaker 1>from being competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also caused capitalists.</v>

65
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 1>Do you flee the country long ago in such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a refuge somewhere else?</v>

66
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:14.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little sounds pretty logical,</v>

67
00:04:14.971 --> 00:04:16.860
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what's the result of this?</v>

68
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since there's no money at home,</v>

69
00:04:18.511 --> 00:04:22.170
<v Speaker 1>Argentina has become very dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign financing.</v>

70
00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.960
<v Speaker 1>According to the Institute of </v>
<v Speaker 1>International Finance,</v>

71
00:04:24.961 --> 00:04:29.961
<v Speaker 1>most almost 64% of Argentina's state and</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate debt is denominated in dollars</v>

72
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:31.313
<v Speaker 1>and other foreign currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why both the volume of central </v>

73
00:04:36.221 --> 00:04:38.710
<v Speaker 1>bank reserves and the exchange rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

74
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:39.820
<v Speaker 1>very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

75
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:46.060
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

76
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>they need to pay for imports and deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with debt payments,</v>

77
00:04:48.581 --> 00:04:51.640
<v Speaker 1>but since Argentina has a negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>external balance,</v>

78
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it consumes more dollars than it gets.</v>

79
00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:57.130
<v Speaker 1>It needs someone to lend them those </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

80
00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>It needs investors to bring money into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country</v>

81
00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.513
<v Speaker 1>and my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if investors don't lend that money </v>

82
00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:10.400
<v Speaker 1>because they don't trust the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then Argentina has a problem,</v>

83
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.340
<v Speaker 1>a really big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hands,</v>

84
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.980
<v Speaker 1>if the peso depreciates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then obviously it loses value in folks.</v>

85
00:05:15.981 --> 00:05:16.814
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody wants to have their savings in a </v>

86
00:05:18.471 --> 00:05:20.420
<v Speaker 1>currency that the is so cool.</v>

87
00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:21.303
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

88
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.560
<v Speaker 1>what do you do in that situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:34.394
<v Speaker 1>essentially what you do is you rush to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange all of your pieces for a </v>

91
00:05:37.161 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>stronger and more stable currency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:40.221 --> 00:05:41.054
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what the population are </v>
<v Speaker 1>doing and that is causing the currency </v>

93
00:05:44.601 --> 00:05:46.370
<v Speaker 1>to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even further,</v>

94
00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>and of course that leaves two reserves </v>
<v Speaker 1>being consumed even faster,</v>

95
00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:51.860
<v Speaker 1>but all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>

96
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

97
00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 5>See,</v>

98
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>both Nesta catch now ran the specialty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cristina Fernandez de Kartchner,</v>

99
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the two previous presidents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

100
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.993
<v Speaker 1>they like to spend quite freely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they came to power in 2002 public </v>

101
00:06:09.471 --> 00:06:13.880
<v Speaker 1>spending was equivalent to 23% of GDP </v>
<v Speaker 1>when they left,</v>

102
00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:17.000
<v Speaker 1>when it was more like 40% now you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>be wondering,</v>

103
00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they do with all the money?</v>

104
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically they hired public employees to</v>

105
00:06:21.111 --> 00:06:23.750
<v Speaker 1>win votes and multiplied subsidies.</v>

106
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:26.260
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

107
00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:27.093
<v Speaker 1>in only 13 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public employment sought by 60% to give </v>

108
00:06:30.521 --> 00:06:32.710
<v Speaker 1>you an idea of how extreme this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

109
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.330
<v Speaker 1>35% of employees in Argentina work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government.</v>

110
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.320
<v Speaker 6>Hopefully they're gonna share this.</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible],</v>

111
00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible],</v>

112
00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:55.370
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible], [inaudible]</v>

113
00:06:57.171 --> 00:06:59.300
<v Speaker 6>select libido basis or Rochelle.</v>

114
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

115
00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>get this in seven provinces in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

116
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:09.080
<v Speaker 1>there are more public workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then there are private.</v>

117
00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:09.973
<v Speaker 1>It really is a crazy situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's given that the government didn't </v>

118
00:07:21.101 --> 00:07:23.530
<v Speaker 1>have enough money to pay for all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>

119
00:07:23.531 --> 00:07:26.650
<v Speaker 1>they continue to register a huge public </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficits.</v>

120
00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:27.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might know,</v>

121
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:28.593
<v Speaker 1>the coach and has couldn't go to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international markets first because </v>

122
00:07:31.511 --> 00:07:32.344
<v Speaker 1>they're investors didn't trust them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds because the country was already </v>

123
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.153
<v Speaker 1>in the fall.</v>

124
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:38.120
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

125
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:38.631
<v Speaker 6>He's wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 6>He,</v>

126
00:07:38.631 --> 00:07:39.464
<v Speaker 6>Naomi Luna,</v>
<v Speaker 6>a [inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

127
00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:49.923
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

128
00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

129
00:07:57.700 --> 00:07:58.533
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nice.</v>

130
00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:02.551
<v Speaker 1>Nine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

131
00:08:02.551 --> 00:08:03.384
<v Speaker 1>if you don't pay your investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously the investors don't lend you </v>

132
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 1>any more money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

133
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:09.570
<v Speaker 1>so what do you think they did then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

134
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.050
<v Speaker 1>they used every populist politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>favorite machine,</v>

135
00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:13.913
<v Speaker 1>the money printing machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply printed new pesos to pay </v>

136
00:08:16.681 --> 00:08:21.681
<v Speaker 1>that public expenditure vasant and </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishing your currency camp,</v>

137
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:23.533
<v Speaker 1>which meant and limiting the amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money there's Argentinians could take </v>

138
00:08:25.970 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So they wouldn't be,</v>

139
00:08:27.831 --> 00:08:32.660
<v Speaker 1>Thomas said dwindling reserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the question is,</v>

140
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:35.600
<v Speaker 1>what happens when these policies </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue?</v>

141
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:36.770
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation,</v>

142
00:08:36.771 --> 00:08:37.604
<v Speaker 1>the soul is due to all the new stays in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation and foreign investors of </v>

143
00:08:40.581 --> 00:08:41.414
<v Speaker 1>course do not want to come near you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so there was in these circumstances </v>

144
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:47.360
<v Speaker 1>that Mauricio Macri came to power</v>

145
00:08:54.790 --> 00:08:55.940
<v Speaker 5>the mockery plants.</v>

146
00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.540
<v Speaker 1>Mauricio Macri came to the Castle </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosado.</v>

147
00:09:01.570 --> 00:09:02.403
<v Speaker 1>He had a plan to implement reforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>little by little that were commonly </v>

148
00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:06.700
<v Speaker 1>known as gradualism,</v>

149
00:09:06.890 --> 00:09:11.890
<v Speaker 3>but eight to implement [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 3>economic [inaudible], [inaudible]</v>

150
00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:19.750
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible], [inaudible]</v>

151
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.920
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible],</v>

152
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:23.510
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is they've actually been </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite successful.</v>

153
00:09:23.540 --> 00:09:24.373
<v Speaker 1>The business climate has improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some subsidies have been reduced and in </v>

154
00:09:27.471 --> 00:09:28.304
<v Speaker 1>a way they regained the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors trust out of all the hard </v>

155
00:09:36.981 --> 00:09:39.980
<v Speaker 1>things they needed to do if they've only</v>
<v Speaker 1>done the easiest ones.</v>

156
00:09:39.981 --> 00:09:40.814
<v Speaker 1>What they haven't achieved in more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>two years of governing has been </v>

157
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:45.260
<v Speaker 1>decreasing the public deficits</v>

158
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:46.443
<v Speaker 5>flushing</v>

159
00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:52.290
<v Speaker 1>in spite of having access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial markets,</v>

160
00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:53.153
<v Speaker 1>the options on government has continued </v>
<v Speaker 1>to prince bills to maintain that public </v>

161
00:09:57.151 --> 00:09:59.970
<v Speaker 1>expenditure out of course means more </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>

162
00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 1>This chart shows how the money is </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>

163
00:10:02.250 --> 00:10:06.420
<v Speaker 1>That is how the Central Bank of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic of Argentina continues to issue</v>

164
00:10:06.450 --> 00:10:11.450
<v Speaker 1>more and more pesos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>

165
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:21.980
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>

166
00:10:21.981 --> 00:10:22.814
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't Mauricio Macri that duty was </v>

167
00:10:23.661 --> 00:10:25.400
<v Speaker 1>supposed to change things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

168
00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:26.263
<v Speaker 1>Gary was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but slowly see this all has an </v>

169
00:10:28.521 --> 00:10:29.354
<v Speaker 1>explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

170
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:32.143
<v Speaker 1>Factories team's idea was to carry out </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms and little by little to attract </v>

171
00:10:34.671 --> 00:10:37.100
<v Speaker 1>investments and make the Argentine </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy grow.</v>

172
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:37.963
<v Speaker 1>If the economy grew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government would raise more money </v>

173
00:10:39.741 --> 00:10:44.741
<v Speaker 1>and would not have to make cuts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

174
00:10:45.951 --> 00:10:46.784
<v Speaker 1>little by little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as they regains the international </v>

175
00:10:48.291 --> 00:10:49.124
<v Speaker 1>markets trust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would be able to issue a debt and </v>

176
00:10:50.901 --> 00:10:53.690
<v Speaker 1>is thus reduce the need to print bills </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this way.</v>

177
00:10:53.691 --> 00:10:54.524
<v Speaker 1>Within a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina would you got rid of that </v>

178
00:10:55.741 --> 00:10:56.574
<v Speaker 1>deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>limit inflation and would start to grow </v>

179
00:10:58.551 --> 00:10:59.570
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an accurate,</v>

180
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:03.440
<v Speaker 1>of course would maintainers political </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital to continue winning elections.</v>

181
00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 1>It all sounds like a pretty great plant </v>
<v Speaker 1>rice.</v>

182
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:06.864
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.453
<v Speaker 5>Well,</v>

184
00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Speaker 1>so far things have actually kind of gone</v>
<v Speaker 1>his plans,</v>

185
00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:18.961
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a moment because things</v>
<v Speaker 1>have now changed and it's mainly for two</v>

186
00:11:19.601 --> 00:11:22.910
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fast.</v>

187
00:11:22.911 --> 00:11:23.744
<v Speaker 1>After two and a half years in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to understand how the public </v>

188
00:11:26.691 --> 00:11:27.524
<v Speaker 1>deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation and taxes continue to </v>

189
00:11:29.631 --> 00:11:30.464
<v Speaker 1>skyrocket.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gradualism how's it become something </v>

190
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.373
<v Speaker 1>like racing and arthritic at all and </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds because the Federal Reserve of </v>

191
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:41.544
<v Speaker 1>the United States has begun to raise </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rates C for public debt in the </v>

192
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:48.780
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10 year bond is already yielding 3%</v>

193
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.153
<v Speaker 5>okay.</v>

194
00:11:57.410 --> 00:11:58.243
<v Speaker 1>Out of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many investors now asked themselves if </v>

195
00:11:59.971 --> 00:12:00.804
<v Speaker 1>the u s desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is supposedly the less risky </v>

196
00:12:02.731 --> 00:12:04.590
<v Speaker 1>assets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gives me a reasonable return.</v>

197
00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Why on earth would I keep lending money </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Argentina?</v>

198
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see no changes.</v>

199
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

200
00:12:13.220 --> 00:12:14.053
<v Speaker 1>well that's exactly what it is because </v>
<v Speaker 1>many people who were interested in </v>

201
00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:18.740
<v Speaker 1>investing in Argentina to turn away from</v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

202
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and for this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>macaroons,</v>

203
00:12:21.470 --> 00:12:25.310
<v Speaker 1>governments has decided to resort to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>international monetary funds to obtain a</v>

204
00:12:25.311 --> 00:12:26.144
<v Speaker 1>credit line with which to face the debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>maturities of the upcoming months and </v>

205
00:12:29.361 --> 00:12:30.194
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you remember what would happen if a </v>

206
00:12:34.151 --> 00:12:37.600
<v Speaker 1>new default occurred before the 2019 </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections?</v>

207
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:38.463
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything has to do with the </v>

208
00:12:39.941 --> 00:12:42.130
<v Speaker 1>government's behaviour and if you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>about it for a moment,</v>

209
00:12:42.131 --> 00:12:45.250
<v Speaker 1>it's actually very sensible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The patients once held for Argentina,</v>

210
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:48.130
<v Speaker 1>it's gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What investors and Argentine savers find</v>

211
00:12:48.131 --> 00:12:48.964
<v Speaker 1>themselves saying is fine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you want to spend more than you can </v>

212
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:53.910
<v Speaker 1>go right ahead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just don't do it with my money.</v>

213
00:12:57.620 --> 00:12:58.453
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

214
00:12:59.030 --> 00:13:01.310
<v Speaker 1>and this is north of me in regards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>public spending,</v>

215
00:13:01.311 --> 00:13:04.310
<v Speaker 1>but many other reforms that make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to do business.</v>

216
00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:06.380
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it brings up a key question.</v>

217
00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.440
<v Speaker 1>Is it time to abandon gradualism </v>
<v Speaker 1>aggressive therapies or gradualism</v>

218
00:13:20.860 --> 00:13:21.070
<v Speaker 2>nope.</v>

219
00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Flakes making reforms is never an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>task,</v>

220
00:13:23.561 --> 00:13:27.130
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's time for the castle </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosado that's the Argentinian version of</v>

221
00:13:27.131 --> 00:13:29.680
<v Speaker 1>the White House to osc itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A question shouldn't leave.</v>

222
00:13:29.681 --> 00:13:32.500
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps try employing more aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>

223
00:13:32.530 --> 00:13:33.311
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

224
00:13:33.311 --> 00:13:35.770
<v Speaker 1>First let's take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historical evidence.</v>

225
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:36.633
<v Speaker 1>Which do you think has worked better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gradualism a con step by step change or </v>

226
00:13:40.421 --> 00:13:41.350
<v Speaker 1>aggressive therapy?</v>

227
00:13:41.430 --> 00:13:42.263
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

228
00:13:43.370 --> 00:13:44.203
<v Speaker 1>we can see a good example of huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformations in the former countries </v>

229
00:13:46.970 --> 00:13:47.803
<v Speaker 1>of the Soviet orbit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the communist model collapsed in </v>

230
00:13:49.431 --> 00:13:54.230
<v Speaker 1>1989 many countries employed drastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes almost overnight while others,</v>

231
00:13:54.231 --> 00:13:55.990
<v Speaker 1>obs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's four more gradual measures.</v>

232
00:13:57.850 --> 00:13:59.950
<v Speaker 1>Now's the best results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the ones that made the most</v>

233
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.793
<v Speaker 2>good</v>

234
00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:07.560
<v Speaker 1>trees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assumptions,</v>

235
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Estonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latvia,</v>

236
00:14:08.681 --> 00:14:09.880
<v Speaker 1>Lithuania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland,</v>

237
00:14:09.881 --> 00:14:10.714
<v Speaker 1>and the Czech Republic opposite for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>more drastic change that is making </v>

238
00:14:14.201 --> 00:14:19.201
<v Speaker 1>reforms as quickly as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

239
00:14:20.170 --> 00:14:21.003
<v Speaker 1>it was pretty hot at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but soon they began to grow and they </v>

240
00:14:23.171 --> 00:14:24.004
<v Speaker 1>achieved all kinds of investments to </v>
<v Speaker 1>such an extent that today these </v>

241
00:14:27.041 --> 00:14:27.874
<v Speaker 1>countries which were mostly poor in 1989</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a higher standard of living than </v>

242
00:14:31.511 --> 00:14:36.511
<v Speaker 1>Portugal or any Latin American country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is though you see what</v>

243
00:14:38.401 --> 00:14:41.160
<v Speaker 1>plying gradual reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries such as Ukraine,</v>

244
00:14:41.161 --> 00:14:42.450
<v Speaker 1>Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tajikistan,</v>

245
00:14:42.451 --> 00:14:43.320
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenia,</v>

246
00:14:43.380 --> 00:14:44.213
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say things haven't gone so </v>

247
00:14:45.901 --> 00:14:50.901
<v Speaker 1>well either an economic or social tams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

248
00:14:52.401 --> 00:14:53.234
<v Speaker 1>if I x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a decision that macri is </v>

249
00:14:54.331 --> 00:14:55.164
<v Speaker 1>government has to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has to decide whether to take </v>

250
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:57.824
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the IMF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some money to carry out strong reforms </v>

251
00:14:59.990 --> 00:15:03.260
<v Speaker 1>once and for all or continue with grand </v>
<v Speaker 1>jury will listen it and let's be clear.</v>

252
00:15:03.290 --> 00:15:07.130
<v Speaker 1>If Argentina doesn't fix its public debt</v>
<v Speaker 1>and stopped printing bills,</v>

253
00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:09.530
<v Speaker 1>the future does not look good.</v>

254
00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.333
<v Speaker 4>Borrowing money is in good governance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Good governance is creating basic </v>

255
00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:15.550
<v Speaker 4>reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Argentina.</v>

256
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:16.413
<v Speaker 4>There's an elephant Tine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>gigantic hypertrophied state that needs </v>

257
00:15:20.531 --> 00:15:24.160
<v Speaker 4>to be slimmed down.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need to cut public spending.</v>

258
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.120
<v Speaker 4>Jame Bailey,</v>

259
00:15:25.300 --> 00:15:27.700
<v Speaker 1>in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model simply doesn't work.</v>

260
00:15:27.701 --> 00:15:30.730
<v Speaker 1>The Argentine government has never spent</v>
<v Speaker 1>so much,</v>

261
00:15:30.760 --> 00:15:31.593
<v Speaker 1>and despite that it's been decades since</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was so much poverty and so much </v>

262
00:15:35.081 --> 00:15:38.920
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we'll mastery listener.</v>

<v Speaker 1>What do you think?</v>

265
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:42.753
<v Speaker 1>Should they continue with the gradual </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms or is it time for a faster </v>
