00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.120
<v Speaker 2>the full rights and Germany are two </v>
<v Speaker 2>things that sound pretty scary.</v>

3
00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:11.954
<v Speaker 2>You when you put them together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why even though Angela Merkel </v>

4
00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:16.160
<v Speaker 2>has won the elections with a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>margin,</v>

5
00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 2>it has been a bittersweet victory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The facts,</v>

6
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.870
<v Speaker 2>the alternative for Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Zena phobic,</v>

7
00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:21.733
<v Speaker 2>ultra conservative party has become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third largest political force is bad </v>

8
00:00:24.531 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 2>enough to make merkel rather uneasy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't need to beat around the bush.</v>

9
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.370
<v Speaker 2>We wanted a better result.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is clear.</v>

10
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.413
<v Speaker 2>Angela Merkel it revision policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what we plan to do a video this week </v>

11
00:00:34.881 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 2>about Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the current news,</v>

12
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:37.820
<v Speaker 2>forster,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid spoon,</v>

13
00:00:37.821 --> 00:00:38.654
<v Speaker 2>that video so we could have time to </v>
<v Speaker 2>prepare this one explaining what's an </v>

14
00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:46.070
<v Speaker 2>alternative for journey or afd as it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>known in Germany is all about and yes,</v>

15
00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:47.930
<v Speaker 2>I probably know what you're thinking </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

16
00:00:47.931 --> 00:00:48.764
<v Speaker 2>You're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on Simon and how could you not </v>

17
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 2>predict that the far right would be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big hit in Germany because well,</v>

18
00:00:54.231 --> 00:00:55.064
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zena phobic parties that pretty much in </v>

19
00:00:56.481 --> 00:01:01.370
<v Speaker 2>fashion all across Europe plus afd did </v>
<v Speaker 2>great in previous local elections.</v>

20
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the polls said that Germans love</v>

21
00:01:10.221 --> 00:01:11.054
<v Speaker 2>moderation above all else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not just the electoral polls </v>

22
00:01:13.671 --> 00:01:15.860
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also sociological studies.</v>

23
00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while in France,</v>

24
00:01:17.241 --> 00:01:18.074
<v Speaker 2>only 50% of the population places </v>
<v Speaker 2>themselves on the center of the </v>

25
00:01:20.481 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 2>spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This number in Germany is as high as 76%</v>

26
00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.660
<v Speaker 2>for the Germans have many reasons to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>happy.</v>

27
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.613
<v Speaker 2>They almost didn't suffer at all during </v>
<v Speaker 2>the economic crisis and now that our </v>

28
00:01:30.801 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 2>economy is doing better than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's salaries are rising,</v>

29
00:01:33.471 --> 00:01:34.304
<v Speaker 2>there's almost full employment and </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies export abroad as if there was </v>

30
00:01:37.221 --> 00:01:38.054
<v Speaker 2>no tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the big question here becomes who </v>

31
00:01:40.521 --> 00:01:44.330
<v Speaker 2>votes for the far right wing in Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>and most important of all,</v>

32
00:01:44.331 --> 00:01:46.250
<v Speaker 2>what is the alternative for Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants?</v>

33
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Are they really a radical party or is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the media exaggerating?</v>

34
00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:51.830
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we're going to answer all of those</v>

35
00:01:51.831 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as usual before we get started,</v>

36
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.790
<v Speaker 2>let's have a look at the history.</v>

37
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 2>A party on the divide.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

38
00:02:00.251 --> 00:02:02.200
<v Speaker 2>it is true today alternative for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

39
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:03.034
<v Speaker 2>They are a populist political party with</v>
<v Speaker 2>a big focus on rejecting immigrants and </v>

40
00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:07.864
<v Speaker 2>refugees specifically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They want to reject those who come from </v>

41
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Islamic countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but just by all of this,</v>

42
00:02:12.851 --> 00:02:16.060
<v Speaker 2>it's origins couldn't be more different </v>
<v Speaker 2>than what it is today.</v>

43
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.030
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to the year 2013 now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Back then,</v>

44
00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.923
<v Speaker 2>all the European media talks about was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the debt crisis that was happening in </v>

45
00:02:22.781 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 2>countries like Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy,</v>

46
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:28.150
<v Speaker 2>and it's specially Greece now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In case you don't know the history here,</v>

47
00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.013
<v Speaker 2>let's have a quick summary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before 2008 German banks invested a lot </v>

48
00:02:35.111 --> 00:02:38.320
<v Speaker 2>of money in lending to companies and </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments in the south of Europe,</v>

49
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:39.183
<v Speaker 2>and it's after the financial crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 2>2008 these countries couldn't give the </v>

50
00:02:42.251 --> 00:02:43.510
<v Speaker 2>money back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

51
00:02:43.511 --> 00:02:47.050
<v Speaker 2>they needed even more cash so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could afford their current spending.</v>

52
00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.750
<v Speaker 2>This included things like the salaries </v>
<v Speaker 2>of civil servants,</v>

53
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 2>highways and hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you can imagine,</v>

54
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.620
<v Speaker 2>paying day to day spending with debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a far from ideal situation.</v>

55
00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.190
<v Speaker 2>So this is where Angela Merkel comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>along and says,</v>

56
00:03:02.191 --> 00:03:04.290
<v Speaker 2>all right guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to lend you the money.</v>

57
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.930
<v Speaker 2>I will even let you give it back </v>
<v Speaker 2>whenever you want,</v>

58
00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 2>but you've got to make some reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See your economic systems.</v>

59
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.380
<v Speaker 2>These reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were known as austerity.</v>

60
00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.273
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alongside with other northern European </v>

61
00:03:15.811 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to lend money to Italy,</v>

62
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.140
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Greece,</v>

63
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.033
<v Speaker 2>while at the same time demanding some </v>
<v Speaker 2>budget cuts so that these countries </v>

64
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:26.910
<v Speaker 2>would no longer need to borrow as much </v>
<v Speaker 2>money in the future and so that they can</v>

65
00:03:26.911 --> 00:03:28.740
<v Speaker 2>pay back their debts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those conditions.</v>

66
00:03:28.741 --> 00:03:29.574
<v Speaker 2>They were seen as pretty draconian by </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of those southern European </v>

67
00:03:32.011 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were asking the question,</v>

68
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:34.524
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whose Germany to tell us how we should </v>

69
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:37.110
<v Speaker 2>spend our money?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

70
00:03:37.111 --> 00:03:37.944
<v Speaker 2>some Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were also pretty mad at their </v>

71
00:03:38.941 --> 00:03:39.870
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

72
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:40.704
<v Speaker 2>they were thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who are you merkel to go around giving </v>

73
00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:44.400
<v Speaker 2>money to everyone?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the European Union,</v>

74
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:48.230
<v Speaker 2>not an NGO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

75
00:03:48.231 --> 00:03:51.590
<v Speaker 2>among those angry Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were three famous economists,</v>

76
00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 2>Alexander Garlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burn luck,</v>

77
00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:54.763
<v Speaker 2>and Conrad Adam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were the founders of the party </v>

78
00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Speaker 2>electorial alternative 2013 which would </v>
<v Speaker 2>later become an alternative for Germany.</v>

79
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:02.523
<v Speaker 2>Any of these first supporters were </v>
<v Speaker 2>bankers and university professors from </v>

80
00:04:05.601 --> 00:04:08.210
<v Speaker 2>the western part of Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cities like Frankfurt,</v>

81
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 2>Cologne and bond,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and do you remember this?</v>

82
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:12.630
<v Speaker 2>Because it's going to become really </v>
<v Speaker 2>important later on</v>

83
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.850
<v Speaker 2>now in the electoral roll manifesto,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they suggested that Germany should leave</v>

84
00:04:20.851 --> 00:04:24.000
<v Speaker 2>the euro and go back to the German mark </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

85
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:24.751
<v Speaker 2>Why was that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

86
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:28.020
<v Speaker 2>this is because they believe that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could avoid bailouts to porter economies</v>

87
00:04:28.021 --> 00:04:28.854
<v Speaker 2>by doing so and even more importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could protect their economy from a </v>

88
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 2>luckily devaluation of the euro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we've said in previous videos,</v>

89
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Germany success was partly due to their </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong currency</v>

90
00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:44.703
<v Speaker 2>pain and Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were pushing the European central </v>

91
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:47.233
<v Speaker 2>banks print more money so that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could pay their debts back and as you </v>

92
00:04:50.061 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 2>probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economists,</v>

93
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:52.364
<v Speaker 2>they thought that was a pretty bad idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first stereotypical afd voters </v>

94
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.240
<v Speaker 2>weren't like the stereotype of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme right wing hooligan.</v>

95
00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 2>They were considered to be businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economists,</v>

96
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:02.743
<v Speaker 2>and university teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why the media started calling </v>

97
00:05:04.941 --> 00:05:05.774
<v Speaker 2>this party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that quote to Teachers Party and why </v>

98
00:05:06.981 --> 00:05:11.810
<v Speaker 2>they couldn't win a single MP during the</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal elections of 2013 I mean,</v>

99
00:05:11.811 --> 00:05:12.644
<v Speaker 2>think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and monetary policy has not exactly a </v>

100
00:05:14.391 --> 00:05:15.224
<v Speaker 2>sexy topic for an electoral campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean pretty much only you're going to </v>

101
00:05:18.651 --> 00:05:20.720
<v Speaker 2>be watching this video care about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>kind of stuff.</v>

102
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.370
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

103
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.900
<v Speaker 2>the phase of alternative for Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was to change in July of 2015 at that</v>

104
00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:31.734
<v Speaker 2>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the economist burn lot of course the </v>

105
00:05:33.091 --> 00:05:35.850
<v Speaker 2>chairman bar to the brand new leader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>frauke petry,</v>

106
00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 2>she had other plants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd like the previous Cedars Petrie came</v>

107
00:05:38.761 --> 00:05:39.594
<v Speaker 2>from the eastern part of the country and</v>
<v Speaker 2>this means she brought eight hopefully </v>

108
00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:44.093
<v Speaker 2>different political culture for her </v>
<v Speaker 2>monetary policy deficits and fiscal </v>

109
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:49.800
<v Speaker 2>responsibility wasn't really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's important.</v>

110
00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.843
<v Speaker 2>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she knew there was a big Nisha voters </v>

111
00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:57.270
<v Speaker 2>who wanted an iron fist on things like </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration and national identity.</v>

112
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.183
<v Speaker 2>Besides these kinds of suggestions would</v>
<v Speaker 2>give her the support of other leaders </v>

113
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>like Nigel Farrage from Britain's Ukip </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party,</v>

114
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 2>Marine Le Pen from the National Front in</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

115
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 2>and of course our favorite politician </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the visual politic mascot.</v>

116
00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.180
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my dear viewer.</v>

117
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:13.220
<v Speaker 2>Of course we are talking about the one </v>
<v Speaker 2>and only</v>

118
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.170
<v Speaker 1>you up</v>

119
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.210
<v Speaker 2>Germany's far right wing party meets </v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin allies in,</v>

120
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.300
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

121
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.133
<v Speaker 1>Moscow.</v>

122
00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.540
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Vladimir Putin is an ever popular</v>

123
00:06:26.541 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 2>topic here at visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's what I mean.</v>

124
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:30.820
<v Speaker 2>How can we resist talking about him?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

125
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.440
<v Speaker 2>During this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of refugees from Syria,</v>

126
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they came to Germany,</v>

127
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:36.613
<v Speaker 2>Angela Merkel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she welcomes them with arms wide open </v>

128
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 2>and well some Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't really like this,</v>

129
00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.650
<v Speaker 2>so in the regional elections of 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll tell him this.</v>

130
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 2>If the Germany launched an electoral </v>
<v Speaker 2>platform,</v>

131
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:51.740
<v Speaker 2>which had nothing to do with what the </v>
<v Speaker 2>founders had in mind at the beginning,</v>

132
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.530
<v Speaker 2>this is why many of those economists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they jumped ship among them.</v>

133
00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:57.540
<v Speaker 2>Luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the first presidents,</v>

134
00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:02.530
<v Speaker 1>pardon,</v>

135
00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:05.590
<v Speaker 2>has fallen irretrievably into the wrong </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands band.</v>

136
00:07:05.591 --> 00:07:06.424
<v Speaker 2>Luca since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative for Germany has had two </v>

137
00:07:08.251 --> 00:07:10.500
<v Speaker 2>factions fighting each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

138
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.720
<v Speaker 2>we have the people leftover from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first group,</v>

139
00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 2>but they are less and less important to </v>
<v Speaker 2>everyday ends.</v>

140
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.833
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have those who came under the </v>

141
00:07:17.161 --> 00:07:20.310
<v Speaker 2>leadership of Frauke petry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This new political structure.</v>

142
00:07:20.311 --> 00:07:23.220
<v Speaker 2>It does mean more voters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also means more problems.</v>

143
00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:24.303
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

144
00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:27.203
<v Speaker 2>The ftes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>current crisis was triggered in mid </v>

145
00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:32.100
<v Speaker 2>January through a tableau breaking </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech by right when you're bjorn hookah</v>

146
00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:36.450
<v Speaker 2>who in a beer hall and dressed in call </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 180 degree turn in Germany's culture</v>

147
00:07:36.451 --> 00:07:40.370
<v Speaker 2>of remembering and atoning for the Nazi </v>
<v Speaker 2>era regardless of how far right when you</v>

148
00:07:40.371 --> 00:07:41.204
<v Speaker 2>want it to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These kinds of things then not really </v>

149
00:07:42.301 --> 00:07:46.260
<v Speaker 2>cool in Germany and this created many </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems from this is patrick.</v>

150
00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:50.340
<v Speaker 2>There are some investigations open </v>
<v Speaker 2>because apparently some of the proposals</v>

151
00:07:50.341 --> 00:07:51.174
<v Speaker 2>on her program might be illegal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that German law is made to </v>

152
00:07:54.391 --> 00:07:55.224
<v Speaker 2>avoid any resurgence of Nazis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The issues in this party are big enough </v>

153
00:07:59.161 --> 00:07:59.994
<v Speaker 2>that even Fralca pitcher you herself had</v>
<v Speaker 2>to resign one day after this last </v>

154
00:08:03.781 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 2>election due to in fighting with some of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more extreme factions of things</v>

155
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:08.983
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

156
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:12.810
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with or without the unfortunate quote,</v>

157
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 2>Sam's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the internal division,</v>

158
00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:15.420
<v Speaker 2>Alzheimer's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If for Germany,</v>

159
00:08:15.421 --> 00:08:17.700
<v Speaker 2>it has become the big surprise from this</v>
<v Speaker 2>election.</v>

160
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:20.020
<v Speaker 2>So the question now becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

161
00:08:20.370 --> 00:08:21.600
<v Speaker 2>voted for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

162
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:26.630
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at this history of </v>
<v Speaker 2>two.</v>

163
00:08:28.261 --> 00:08:32.610
<v Speaker 2>Germany's for the past few years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the German economy has been on fire,</v>

164
00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:33.503
<v Speaker 2>salaries are growing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are exporting and inequality </v>

165
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:38.250
<v Speaker 2>is almost nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

166
00:08:38.251 --> 00:08:41.280
<v Speaker 2>actually just hold on for my own because</v>
<v Speaker 2>that last bit,</v>

167
00:08:41.310 --> 00:08:45.030
<v Speaker 2>it's not exactly sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now of course there is almost no poverty</v>

168
00:08:45.031 --> 00:08:47.520
<v Speaker 2>on the streets and that our factories </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the country,</v>

169
00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:50.550
<v Speaker 2>but when we look at the income </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution by regions,</v>

170
00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.300
<v Speaker 2>do you see a clear division?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you pay attention to this map,</v>

171
00:08:54.301 --> 00:08:56.370
<v Speaker 2>you'll see a part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the red part,</v>

172
00:09:04.090 --> 00:09:05.780
<v Speaker 2>it's a bleed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pause is the wealthiest.</v>

173
00:09:05.810 --> 00:09:09.860
<v Speaker 2>The red part is the poorest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The blue part is what used to be western</v>

174
00:09:09.861 --> 00:09:13.250
<v Speaker 2>Germany and the red part is what used to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be eastern Germany,</v>

175
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:16.130
<v Speaker 2>communist Germany or that eastern part </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the country is the Germany,</v>

176
00:09:16.131 --> 00:09:20.540
<v Speaker 2>the wing capitalist in 1989 but still </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't have the same standard of living</v>

177
00:09:20.541 --> 00:09:21.374
<v Speaker 2>as the west.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you visit a city like Dresden in </v>

178
00:09:23.031 --> 00:09:23.864
<v Speaker 2>eastern Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you will see lots of construction going </v>

179
00:09:25.851 --> 00:09:26.684
<v Speaker 2>on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the buildings they were </v>

180
00:09:27.261 --> 00:09:28.094
<v Speaker 2>completed just a couple of years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is indicative that the </v>

181
00:09:30.201 --> 00:09:33.740
<v Speaker 2>reunification of Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still very much an ongoing process.</v>

182
00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.491
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

183
00:09:34.491 --> 00:09:35.324
<v Speaker 2>if we compare these standards of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>of an eastern German with a Greek or a </v>

184
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:40.130
<v Speaker 2>Spaniard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't look that bad,</v>

185
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:40.983
<v Speaker 2>but it's Germans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They like to be compared with other </v>

186
00:09:42.441 --> 00:09:44.840
<v Speaker 2>Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and when you do that,</v>

187
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:45.750
<v Speaker 2>things look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait,</v>

188
00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:46.460
<v Speaker 2>wes,</v>

189
00:09:46.460 --> 00:09:47.293
<v Speaker 3>she made,</v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't have enough industrial </v>

190
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:51.800
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and it lacks proper </v>
<v Speaker 3>educational facilities.</v>

191
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.253
<v Speaker 3>A large sport and cultural center aren't</v>
<v Speaker 3>enough to keep people from leaving the </v>

192
00:09:55.971 --> 00:09:58.790
<v Speaker 3>city.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's dead quiet in the town center.</v>

193
00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:02.300
<v Speaker 3>Young people have left in droves for </v>
<v Speaker 3>bigger cities in the west.</v>

194
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 3>A sculpture on the riverbank mirrors the</v>
<v Speaker 3>city's troubled hopes for the future.</v>

195
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:08.573
<v Speaker 2>In this city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the city of sweat alternative for </v>

196
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.004
<v Speaker 2>Germany got over 20% of the votes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Julissa further south in the state of </v>

197
00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:15.234
<v Speaker 2>Saxony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most people are voting for the far </v>

198
00:10:17.101 --> 00:10:17.934
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hold on a minute because we're not </v>

199
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:19.644
<v Speaker 2>just talking about the economy here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a totally different </v>

200
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.580
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

201
00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:24.473
<v Speaker 2>East Germans lived for entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>generations under a totally different </v>

202
00:10:28.081 --> 00:10:30.750
<v Speaker 2>political system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means a different education,</v>

203
00:10:30.751 --> 00:10:34.110
<v Speaker 2>a different lifestyle and different </v>
<v Speaker 2>values here.</v>

204
00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.270
<v Speaker 2>Moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not really a good thing.</v>

205
00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.920
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the left wing party day,</v>

206
00:10:37.921 --> 00:10:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Linka gets most of its votes in eastern </v>
<v Speaker 2>Berlin,</v>

207
00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 2>but there's more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

208
00:10:45.121 --> 00:10:48.120
<v Speaker 2>western German spent decades remembering</v>
<v Speaker 2>their Nazi past.</v>

209
00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:48.983
<v Speaker 2>The government of the Democratic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republic of Germany tried to create a </v>

210
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:55.110
<v Speaker 2>new sense of national pride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So when an afd candidate says that,</v>

211
00:10:55.111 --> 00:10:55.944
<v Speaker 2>we must appreciate the courage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>German soldiers during World War Two </v>

212
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.190
<v Speaker 2>Germans from Cologne or frightened,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Germans from Leipzig say,</v>

213
00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:02.911
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

214
00:11:02.911 --> 00:11:03.840
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

215
00:11:03.841 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 2>but now there is a really important </v>
<v Speaker 2>question.</v>

216
00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:10.140
<v Speaker 2>Why is eastern Germany is so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>against refugees and immigrants?</v>

217
00:11:10.350 --> 00:11:11.183
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of you might think this is because </v>

218
00:11:12.121 --> 00:11:15.090
<v Speaker 2>they are tired of Muslims who don't want</v>
<v Speaker 2>to integrate into their culture.</v>

219
00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

220
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 2>here comes a number that is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolutely blow your minds.</v>

221
00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:24.680
<v Speaker 2>There aren't 9 million immigrants living</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany and less than 500,000 in East</v>

222
00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.233
<v Speaker 2>German.</v>

223
00:11:29.990 --> 00:11:31.040
<v Speaker 2>And when you're ready,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>

224
00:11:31.041 --> 00:11:32.600
<v Speaker 2>This makes total sense.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean those,</v>

225
00:11:32.601 --> 00:11:33.434
<v Speaker 2>he moved to Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to be in the wealthiest </v>

226
00:11:34.941 --> 00:11:35.774
<v Speaker 2>regions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you walked down the streets of </v>

227
00:11:36.981 --> 00:11:37.814
<v Speaker 2>Dresden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're hardly ever going to see a woman </v>

228
00:11:38.781 --> 00:11:39.614
<v Speaker 2>covering her head with a hijab.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then guess who is the biggest </v>

229
00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:44.240
<v Speaker 2>immigrant community in eastern Germany?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While surprise,</v>

230
00:11:44.241 --> 00:11:46.100
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be the Russians.</v>

231
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.700
<v Speaker 2>Well then half of the immigrants living </v>
<v Speaker 2>on this side of the country,</v>

232
00:11:48.701 --> 00:11:52.310
<v Speaker 2>it come from the lands of Putin and of </v>
