1
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:09.743
<v Speaker 1>Don't want us to become something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Asian version of Asterix and Obelix </v>

2
00:00:12.291 --> 00:00:13.124
<v Speaker 1>is irreducible village,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small enclave surrounded by a great </v>

3
00:00:16.191 --> 00:00:17.024
<v Speaker 1>empire that wants to engulf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It ends as with the small Gaelic </v>

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:20.683
<v Speaker 1>village.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The citizens of Taiwan also have their </v>

5
00:00:21.891 --> 00:00:25.730
<v Speaker 1>own magic potion to defend themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>against their enemies.</v>

6
00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.960
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

7
00:00:26.961 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 1>we aren't talking about potions made by </v>
<v Speaker 1>a druid.</v>

8
00:00:29.151 --> 00:00:33.050
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States of America.</v>

9
00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

10
00:00:34.551 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>and also reasonably well something else </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>

11
00:00:37.251 --> 00:00:38.084
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has a new ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new secret advantage that is already </v>

12
00:00:40.761 --> 00:00:43.850
<v Speaker 1>fueling Beijing's wrath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so listen up.</v>

13
00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Beijing's rat one is facing enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure from mainland China,</v>

14
00:00:55.801 --> 00:00:56.634
<v Speaker 1>which as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes the island as part of its </v>

15
00:00:58.651 --> 00:00:59.484
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not talking about the usual </v>

16
00:01:01.111 --> 00:01:04.650
<v Speaker 1>international politics tug of war where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you know the usual.</v>

17
00:01:04.651 --> 00:01:06.120
<v Speaker 1>You get to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you take it?</v>

18
00:01:06.121 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 1>I get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I threaten you.</v>

19
00:01:07.771 --> 00:01:12.771
<v Speaker 1>Then we ultimately let it be known.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not the situation here at all.</v>

20
00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Beijing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've actually even set a deadline.</v>

21
00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.673
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese government has made it clear</v>
<v Speaker 1>time and time again that it's ready to </v>

22
00:01:22.501 --> 00:01:24.540
<v Speaker 1>do what it takes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fourth year,</v>

23
00:01:24.541 --> 00:01:25.374
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49 for the centennial of the People's </v>

24
00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.183
<v Speaker 1>Republic of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan will have to rejoin mainland </v>

25
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.120
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

26
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.953
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

27
00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:35.163
<v Speaker 1>Course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This leads to a problem maddens and not </v>

28
00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 1>exactly a small one that I went is </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really in favor of it.</v>

29
00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:42.710
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want nothing to do with it.</v>

30
00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.843
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we mentioned here on visual politic </v>

31
00:01:46.991 --> 00:01:47.824
<v Speaker 1>in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Progressive Party of </v>

32
00:01:49.691 --> 00:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>sight in Wang who by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of our 2017 are award winning</v>

33
00:01:53.651 --> 00:01:54.484
<v Speaker 1>leaders of the year and there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of an independent games at </v>

34
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 1>power in Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the power,</v>

35
00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.990
<v Speaker 1>both of Congress and the presidency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And since then,</v>

36
00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.230
<v Speaker 1>let's just say Beijing hasn't taken it </v>
<v Speaker 1>very well.</v>

37
00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

38
00:02:06.311 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>that wouldn't be accurate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took it horrible.</v>

39
00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.753
<v Speaker 1>Tying Wang became president practically </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the very first minute Beijing's </v>

40
00:02:14.671 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>pressures against the island have </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplied.</v>

41
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And in recent months it's already </v>
<v Speaker 1>reached politically obsessive levels.</v>

42
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:21.803
<v Speaker 1>They've cut diplomatic ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>try to punish Taiwan economically and </v>

43
00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.660
<v Speaker 1>have implemented huge military exercises</v>
<v Speaker 1>all around the island.</v>

44
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.963
<v Speaker 1>That's not all Tszujing things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government is also using all leds means </v>

45
00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:33.861
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

46
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.220
<v Speaker 1>raise Taiwan's name and identity from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the map.</v>

47
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.083
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we published our first video about </v>

48
00:02:38.741 --> 00:02:39.574
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 countries formally recognize the </v>

49
00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.890
<v Speaker 1>islands government in Taipei is China's </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate government.</v>

50
00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've covered before,</v>

51
00:02:46.331 --> 00:02:48.430
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has never declared its </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

52
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:51.760
<v Speaker 1>but for years it's claimed it's China's </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate government.</v>

53
00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.380
<v Speaker 1>And of course diplomatically our country</v>
<v Speaker 1>can only have one recognize government.</v>

54
00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing has multiplied its diplomatic </v>

55
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 1>agenda to end the situation today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a year later.</v>

56
00:03:07.811 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 1>Only 17 countries consider it so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and almost all of them are tiny,</v>

57
00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.210
<v Speaker 1>but that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:03:13.211 --> 00:03:16.360
<v Speaker 1>given the circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing's move would be understandable.</v>

59
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Something like you're,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the legitimate government of China,</v>

60
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.980
<v Speaker 1>but this is no longer a question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's the legitimate governments,</v>

61
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.833
<v Speaker 1>but simply the Beijing has said both </v>
<v Speaker 1>actively and passively that it will </v>

62
00:03:27.551 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 1>never allow Taiwan to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>

63
00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:31.233
<v Speaker 1>And one way to prevent that is precisely</v>
<v Speaker 1>by trying to erase all traces of the </v>

64
00:03:34.901 --> 00:03:35.734
<v Speaker 1>islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>National identity tried essentially he </v>

65
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:39.490
<v Speaker 1>wants people to think Taiwan wants that </v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

66
00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>Brands you see in order to pull this </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

67
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.004
<v Speaker 1>Beijing is blocking the presence of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwanese representatives and even it's </v>

68
00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:51.010
<v Speaker 1>journalists from all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international bodies that it can,</v>

69
00:03:51.011 --> 00:03:51.844
<v Speaker 1>such as the World Health Organization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's finding companies that sell </v>

70
00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:57.490
<v Speaker 1>products in China with the mainland </v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan label.</v>

71
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.050
<v Speaker 1>This is something that has happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese Jane Muji.</v>

72
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 1>Another case we know about is that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gap clothing Shane,</v>

73
00:04:03.131 --> 00:04:03.964
<v Speaker 1>which had to apologize for selling tee </v>
<v Speaker 1>shirts in North America that didn't </v>

74
00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>include Taiwan as part of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even say when he's music groups like the</v>

75
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 1>Indie punk band,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fire axe.</v>

76
00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:12.444
<v Speaker 1>So you don't support the reunification </v>
<v Speaker 1>are disappearing from Chinese streaming </v>

77
00:04:15.311 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>music services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how about one more example?</v>

78
00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to Beijing's threats,</v>

79
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:24.160
<v Speaker 1>airlines from all over the world and no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer using the islands name.</v>

80
00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.390
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're really did hear that,</v>

81
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.224
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even American companies aren't using </v>

82
00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan's name anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

83
00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.093
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can absolutely book a ticket from </v>

84
00:04:31.061 --> 00:04:34.630
<v Speaker 1>New York to Taipei,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't ask which country you're going</v>

85
00:04:34.631 --> 00:04:37.090
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although yes,</v>

86
00:04:37.091 --> 00:04:37.924
<v Speaker 1>unlike other international companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as British Airways or Lufthansa or </v>

87
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.340
<v Speaker 1>who are already selling tickets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan,</v>

88
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.193
<v Speaker 1>this part of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American companies have simply resorted </v>

89
00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:46.323
<v Speaker 1>to the ghost country trek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ghost country trick is them just </v>

90
00:04:48.521 --> 00:04:51.040
<v Speaker 1>selling tickets to Taipei and when </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone asks,</v>

91
00:04:51.041 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>it's just a response of who cares.</v>

92
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.003
<v Speaker 1>We can't blame them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trainees aviation market is simply </v>

93
00:04:57.851 --> 00:05:01.630
<v Speaker 1>too big and many companies have direct </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests in that country.</v>

94
00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Trainers goal regarding Taiwan has never</v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

95
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:07.300
<v Speaker 1>That goal is just swallow up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan,</v>

96
00:05:07.301 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exterminate Taiwanese democracy,</v>

97
00:05:09.941 --> 00:05:10.774
<v Speaker 1>and achieved ultimate unification Lee </v>
<v Speaker 1>tongue where Taiwan's first </v>

98
00:05:13.721 --> 00:05:14.554
<v Speaker 1>democratically elected president to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times without getting any </v>

99
00:05:17.441 --> 00:05:18.274
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>American Airlines is a shareholder of </v>

100
00:05:19.511 --> 00:05:21.790
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Southern Airlines and Delta on the other</v>

101
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:23.680
<v Speaker 1>hands of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eastern Airlines.</v>

102
00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:24.543
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a moment here because it's not all </v>

103
00:05:26.621 --> 00:05:29.430
<v Speaker 1>bad news for Taiwan along with the US is</v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

104
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.750
<v Speaker 1>The island has gains and other powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>ally,</v>

105
00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:32.613
<v Speaker 1>or you could say hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is developing its own magic potion </v>

106
00:05:35.741 --> 00:05:38.170
<v Speaker 1>that no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not talking about weapons.</v>

107
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Listen Up Mecca</v>

108
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:52.290
<v Speaker 2>folks.</v>

109
00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:56.820
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has been chosen as the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asian host of the Oslo Freedom Forum,</v>

110
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:00.830
<v Speaker 1>like a Congress and international </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting on human rights,</v>

111
00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>but some of you might be wondering a </v>
<v Speaker 1>congress,</v>

112
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>I mean is that rarely so important while</v>
<v Speaker 1>devalue it.</v>

113
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not so much for the congress,</v>

114
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:10.520
<v Speaker 1>but ultimately what it means.</v>

115
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.430
<v Speaker 2>Even though</v>

116
00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:18.530
<v Speaker 3>global democracy has experienced a </v>
<v Speaker 3>general trend of backsliding in the past</v>

117
00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.403
<v Speaker 3>few years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan's democracy has persisted and </v>

118
00:06:20.851 --> 00:06:21.684
<v Speaker 3>continues to thrive.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan can continue to serve as an </v>

119
00:06:24.001 --> 00:06:27.330
<v Speaker 3>inspiration to Democrats in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including those in China.</v>

120
00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.283
<v Speaker 3>Ketty Jen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vice president of the Taiwan Foundation </v>

121
00:06:30.541 --> 00:06:31.374
<v Speaker 3>for democracy.</v>

122
00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.440
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for decades,</v>

123
00:06:32.441 --> 00:06:33.274
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong was the great bastion of </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression in this area of </v>

124
00:06:36.911 --> 00:06:37.744
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if international media and human </v>

125
00:06:40.571 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>rights organizations establish their </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters there,</v>

126
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.223
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong mostly became a refuge for </v>

127
00:06:45.711 --> 00:06:47.710
<v Speaker 1>many political exiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>

128
00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:50.530
<v Speaker 1>the student leaders who lead the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tiananmen Square protest.</v>

129
00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.903
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent times as we've seen here on </v>

130
00:06:54.621 --> 00:06:55.454
<v Speaker 1>visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have changed and Beijing has </v>

131
00:06:57.290 --> 00:07:00.260
<v Speaker 1>tightened its grip on Hong Kong's </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

132
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.210
<v Speaker 3>Kong was originally the first choice for</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Asia Bureau,</v>

133
00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:18.060
<v Speaker 3>but today China doesn't just suppress </v>
<v Speaker 3>its own people.</v>

134
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:21.600
<v Speaker 3>It is now increasingly exporting that </v>
<v Speaker 3>suppression to Hong Kong.</v>

135
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.493
<v Speaker 3>Will Eric,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I see an emeritus member of Reporters </v>

136
00:07:24.721 --> 00:07:29.721
<v Speaker 3>Without Borders and a student leader of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 1989 tiananmen protests</v>

137
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As this change was taking place,</v>

138
00:07:32.121 --> 00:07:32.954
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan consolidated itself as a vibrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and one of the freest places </v>

139
00:07:36.981 --> 00:07:39.170
<v Speaker 1>in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's precisely why it's replacing.</v>

140
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:43.310
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong is the Mecca for freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>activists and human rights in Asia.</v>

141
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.203
<v Speaker 1>This is even though Taiwan until 1987,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was under the control of an ironclad </v>

142
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:53.710
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

143
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.374
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the human rights film festivals </v>

144
00:08:02.031 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>that used to be held in Hong Kong has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been moved to Taiwan.</v>

145
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:05.750
<v Speaker 1>Lamb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>winky,</v>

146
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:06.613
<v Speaker 1>one of the Hong Kong book publishers who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was kidnapped by the Chinese government </v>

147
00:08:09.380 --> 00:08:10.213
<v Speaker 1>two years ago has announced that he will</v>
<v Speaker 1>reopen his bookstore in Taiwan and </v>

148
00:08:13.401 --> 00:08:14.234
<v Speaker 1>Reporters Without Borders announced in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 that it's first Asian office will </v>

149
00:08:17.601 --> 00:08:18.980
<v Speaker 1>be in Tai Pei.</v>

150
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:22.490
<v Speaker 3>Freedom of expression is a big part of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Taiwanese culture.</v>

151
00:08:22.550 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 3>Cedric the Taipei bureau director of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Reporters Without Borders.</v>

152
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.990
<v Speaker 1>These are just some examples of what it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was already becoming.</v>

153
00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>A generalized trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

154
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.530
<v Speaker 1>political plurality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of expression,</v>

155
00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.270
<v Speaker 1>human rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same sex marriage.</v>

156
00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.133
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan is becoming a benchmark for all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them and obviously this poses a huge </v>

157
00:08:39.681 --> 00:08:41.360
<v Speaker 1>problem for China's interests.</v>

158
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

159
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:44.440
<v Speaker 1>for one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Taiwanese love freedom,</v>

160
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:48.840
<v Speaker 1>so of course they don't want anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>do with being ruled again by Beijing and</v>

161
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:51.570
<v Speaker 1>for another while the Chinese government</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempts to erase,</v>

162
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.370
<v Speaker 1>to annihilate at the time when he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity throughout the wells,</v>

163
00:08:54.371 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>the country has suddenly emerged as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>center of freedom with all the influence</v>

164
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:02.040
<v Speaker 1>that that entails.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

165
00:09:02.041 --> 00:09:02.874
<v Speaker 1>it's much harder to consider attacking a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country that is famous for its </v>

166
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:08.700
<v Speaker 1>commitment to human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>International community simply would not</v>

167
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:09.534
<v Speaker 1>accept it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that this maybe </v>

168
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.580
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan's best move this one up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new move,</v>

169
00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.163
<v Speaker 1>July 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second Apache helicopter squadron </v>

170
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.433
<v Speaker 1>made in Taiwan went into service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's part of what is strengthening the </v>

171
00:09:31.471 --> 00:09:33.950
<v Speaker 1>partnership between Washington and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Taipei,</v>

172
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:36.900
<v Speaker 1>of which incidentally we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak about in a future video.</v>

173
00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.793
<v Speaker 1>Among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this includes a significant increase in </v>

174
00:09:39.811 --> 00:09:42.750
<v Speaker 1>the sale of equipment and military </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology to the island.</v>

175
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:46.050
<v Speaker 1>One is buying helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks,</v>

176
00:09:46.051 --> 00:09:48.000
<v Speaker 1>missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anti aircraft systems,</v>

177
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:50.730
<v Speaker 1>and now even wants to develop its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>submarines.</v>

178
00:09:50.760 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>

179
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 1>it seems increasingly clear that </v>
<v Speaker 1>militarily,</v>

180
00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.450
<v Speaker 1>it'll be difficult for Taiwan to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

181
00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 1>The budget difference is simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>

182
00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:01.463
<v Speaker 1>China's military budget is between 15 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 20 times that of Taiwan and it </v>

183
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:06.504
<v Speaker 1>shows,</v>

184
00:10:08.070 --> 00:10:08.280
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

185
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.113
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true nowadays there's the United </v>

186
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:11.573
<v Speaker 1>States umbrella,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even that isn't enough to have the </v>

187
00:10:13.171 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>guarantee that the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>community would act in their favor.</v>

188
00:10:16.230 --> 00:10:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan needs to reinforce its influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world,</v>

189
00:10:19.741 --> 00:10:22.500
<v Speaker 1>especially if it wants to become an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent country.</v>

190
00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.363
<v Speaker 1>Now the question we need to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves here is how on earth I think </v>

191
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:28.020
<v Speaker 1>going to be able to achieve this?</v>

192
00:10:32.540 --> 00:10:34.220
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks that may surprise you,</v>

193
00:10:34.221 --> 00:10:35.054
<v Speaker 1>the military strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while essential may not actually be the </v>

194
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:38.684
<v Speaker 1>most important thing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has to gain influence and </v>

195
00:10:41.031 --> 00:10:41.864
<v Speaker 1>prominence in the world while overcoming</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic problems that we talked </v>

196
00:10:44.571 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>about in a previous video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To do so,</v>

197
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.540
<v Speaker 1>it can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

198
00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 1>seek to attract students from all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia and indeed the world by giving them</v>

199
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.843
<v Speaker 1>facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoting programs in English and </v>

200
00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:55.054
<v Speaker 1>attracting first grade teachers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would mean gaining a lot of </v>

201
00:10:57.651 --> 00:11:00.620
<v Speaker 1>influence and of course human capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seconds,</v>

202
00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:01.483
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan can set in motion and aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy to attract multinationals and to </v>

203
00:11:04.581 --> 00:11:06.920
<v Speaker 1>get them to establish not only factories</v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

204
00:11:06.921 --> 00:11:10.790
<v Speaker 1>but above all research centers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative headquarters.</v>

205
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.960
<v Speaker 1>They can do so by devoting special </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to attracting content creation</v>

206
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:16.070
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

207
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.160
<v Speaker 1>film studios,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube as et Cetera,</v>

208
00:11:18.161 --> 00:11:18.994
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

209
00:11:24.470 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 2>that</v>

210
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:27.900
<v Speaker 1>the government could seek to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics enclave,</v>

211
00:11:27.901 --> 00:11:28.734
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by developing its app or capabilities </v>

212
00:11:30.361 --> 00:11:31.194
<v Speaker 1>and thus becoming a large communication </v>
<v Speaker 1>sub for thick and attract more </v>

213
00:11:33.961 --> 00:11:34.794
<v Speaker 1>professionals from the rest of Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would allow her to both face the </v>

214
00:11:37.471 --> 00:11:38.304
<v Speaker 1>islands aging population problem and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also to strengthen its ties with the </v>

215
00:11:41.551 --> 00:11:43.530
<v Speaker 1>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places of origin and fifth,</v>

216
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:48.030
<v Speaker 1>it must continue to promote its role as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a center for human rights and freedom of</v>

217
00:11:48.031 --> 00:11:50.300
<v Speaker 1>expression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

218
00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>so maybe this plan is not as exciting as</v>
<v Speaker 1>just buying huge weapons,</v>

219
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:54.934
<v Speaker 1>but it would certainly be cheaper as </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to compete with China only via </v>

220
00:11:57.821 --> 00:11:58.654
<v Speaker 1>the military route seems complicated and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would boost the island's economy as </v>

221
00:12:01.691 --> 00:12:02.524
<v Speaker 1>well as give it a lot of influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world given the </v>

222
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A university,</v>

223
00:12:06.041 --> 00:12:07.570
<v Speaker 1>a film studio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a hotel,</v>

224
00:12:07.571 --> 00:12:08.404
<v Speaker 1>or the headquarters of a human rights or</v>
<v Speaker 1>multinational organization can be much </v>

225
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.130
<v Speaker 1>more important for the island survival </v>
<v Speaker 1>than for example,</v>

226
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:16.233
<v Speaker 1>a battleship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not about giving some ultra </v>

227
00:12:19.811 --> 00:12:22.270
<v Speaker 1>pacifist discourse or anything like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

228
00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.800
<v Speaker 1>It's just about pure pragmatism.</v>

229
00:12:24.890 --> 00:12:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

230
00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:29.190
<v Speaker 1>If we're talking about guaranteeing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan's independence and freedom,</v>

231
00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:31.050
<v Speaker 1>this is how to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

232
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the international community</v>
<v Speaker 1>should guarantee Taiwan security?</v>

233
00:12:34.680 --> 00:12:35.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave your answer in the comments as </v>

234
00:12:36.451 --> 00:12:39.240
<v Speaker 1>well as in this survey and I really hope</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did enjoy this video.</v>
