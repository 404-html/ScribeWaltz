1
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.210
<v Speaker 1>But if you have asked us to make a video</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Mexican elections,</v>

2
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:15.080
<v Speaker 1>which are arguably the most important in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the history of Mexico,</v>

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.140
<v Speaker 1>but why all these elections so </v>
<v Speaker 1>important?</v>

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.033
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because this might be the first </v>

5
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>time in the history of Mexico that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>say goodbye to by partisan politics,</v>

6
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.063
<v Speaker 1>election polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lopez Obrador is 10 point nine points </v>

7
00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>above his biggest rival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a minute here because Mexico</v>

8
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>isn't even actually a bipartisan </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

9
00:00:36.561 --> 00:00:37.394
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico has had the same political party </v>

10
00:00:39.081 --> 00:00:41.300
<v Speaker 1>in governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Five or 70 years.</v>

11
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.390
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right from 1930 until the</v>

12
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.223
<v Speaker 1>year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every Mexican president belongs to the </v>

13
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.560
<v Speaker 1>Institutional Revolution Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also known as P,</v>

14
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.580
<v Speaker 1>R I from their Spanish acronym and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>

15
00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>How can you be a revolutionary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutional at the same time?</v>

16
00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:05.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody really knows,</v>

17
00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:08.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's the name of the party got.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>

18
00:01:08.051 --> 00:01:10.690
<v Speaker 1>pri is a sense of left wing party or </v>
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>

19
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:11.543
<v Speaker 1>Many Mexicans would say that just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>casual party with no clear ideology or </v>

20
00:01:15.641 --> 00:01:16.474
<v Speaker 1>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only simply their lust for power </v>

21
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.730
<v Speaker 1>still for 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PRI was winning.</v>

22
00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Every election after the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 Mexicans took a 12 year hiatus from</v>

23
00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:29.200
<v Speaker 1>pri with the conservative and National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Action Party,</v>

24
00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.470
<v Speaker 1>also known as pan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in 2012,</v>

25
00:01:32.471 --> 00:01:36.340
<v Speaker 1>the PRI struck back and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidency with Enrique Kenya.</v>

26
00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.223
<v Speaker 1>Yes sir.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A guy who now holds the title of </v>

27
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.853
<v Speaker 1>Mexico's most hated president ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is why right now with Mexico </v>

28
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:45.034
<v Speaker 1>about to hold these game changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections on June the first John says </v>

29
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.080
<v Speaker 1>that neither the Pri and all the here </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we'll win office.</v>

30
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.530
<v Speaker 1>The front runner is this man here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andres Manuel Lopez,</v>

31
00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.423
<v Speaker 1>Obrador.</v>

32
00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>Then a worried by the Lopez Obrador </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic agenda.</v>

33
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.850
<v Speaker 1>This is the third time he's run for </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and it might be the final time,</v>

34
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Mexicans knew him,</v>

35
00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:11.703
<v Speaker 1>and Lo has policies that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to put it mildly scap verse out of </v>

36
00:02:15.191 --> 00:02:19.060
<v Speaker 1>business people and foreign investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people argue the Mexico might be on</v>

37
00:02:19.061 --> 00:02:19.894
<v Speaker 1>the brink of becoming the new Venezuela </v>
<v Speaker 1>there if they choose a populist </v>

38
00:02:22.691 --> 00:02:24.430
<v Speaker 1>politician like him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

39
00:02:24.431 --> 00:02:27.820
<v Speaker 1>his worst enemy is not businessmen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually himself.</v>

40
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:28.713
<v Speaker 1>His public statements are scaring away </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the moderate voters and that is a </v>

41
00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>problem because they could direct all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this and um,</v>

42
00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.980
<v Speaker 1>sentiment towards one of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

43
00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.043
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's today's questions are why can </v>

44
00:02:44.681 --> 00:02:45.514
<v Speaker 1>ambula win this election and all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate reasons to be scared of his </v>

45
00:02:49.301 --> 00:02:50.134
<v Speaker 1>presidency feather.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also want to look at were there any </v>

46
00:02:51.761 --> 00:02:54.580
<v Speaker 1>other kinds of data could really </v>
<v Speaker 1>overshadow him in the election?</v>

47
00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:55.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

48
00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.163
<v Speaker 1>good news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to answer all of those </v>

49
00:02:56.681 --> 00:02:57.790
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

50
00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:58.713
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican disappointment at the beginning </v>

51
00:03:07.021 --> 00:03:07.854
<v Speaker 1>of the 21st century it seems like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico was taking no prisoners with </v>

52
00:03:11.911 --> 00:03:15.150
<v Speaker 1>plenty of natural resources like oil and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silva.</v>

53
00:03:15.151 --> 00:03:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Mexico was one of the most appreciated </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging economies in 2010.</v>

54
00:03:19.621 --> 00:03:23.700
<v Speaker 1>The country's GDP growth rate of five </v>
<v Speaker 1>point five cents.</v>

55
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.623
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the other emerging economies </v>

56
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.220
<v Speaker 1>of Brazil and South Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico went from hero to zero in 2016</v>

57
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.563
<v Speaker 1>can GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In US dollars is at its worst level </v>

58
00:03:38.821 --> 00:03:40.710
<v Speaker 1>since 2010.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the pricing.</v>

59
00:03:40.711 --> 00:03:41.544
<v Speaker 1>If we take into account that Mexico has </v>
<v Speaker 1>countless opportunities to become a </v>

60
00:03:44.371 --> 00:03:45.930
<v Speaker 1>wealthy nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have oil,</v>

61
00:03:45.931 --> 00:03:49.890
<v Speaker 1>a good climate for agriculture and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of natural resources,</v>

62
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>and even more importantly than those </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

63
00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.660
<v Speaker 1>they share a border with America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

64
00:03:54.661 --> 00:03:57.090
<v Speaker 1>Nafta is a trade agreement between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

65
00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:01.560
<v Speaker 1>the USA and Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and say 80 percent of Mexican exports go</v>

66
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.020
<v Speaker 1>to Uncle Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite all of this,</v>

67
00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:04.854
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is still a mid level income </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with low wages and a much lower </v>

68
00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:11.350
<v Speaker 1>quality of life than it's northern </v>
<v Speaker 1>native.</v>

69
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:16.640
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

70
00:04:16.641 --> 00:04:17.474
<v Speaker 1>why is this well off to 70 years of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically one party system with </v>

71
00:04:20.961 --> 00:04:22.820
<v Speaker 1>corruption and drug trafficking going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>

72
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:23.833
<v Speaker 1>Mexico has almost medieval institutions </v>
<v Speaker 1>and I know you're probably thinking </v>

73
00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:28.491
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking,</v>

74
00:04:28.491 --> 00:04:30.440
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon's exaggerating again.</v>

75
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:31.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about you judge for yourself until </v>

76
00:04:32.691 --> 00:04:33.524
<v Speaker 1>the year 2016?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That judicial system had no presumption </v>

77
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.080
<v Speaker 1>of innocence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so that wasn't even a need for evidence.</v>

78
00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.630
<v Speaker 1>In order to convict someone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>

79
00:04:41.631 --> 00:04:42.464
<v Speaker 1>a confession obtained through torture </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be more than enough to send </v>

80
00:04:45.801 --> 00:04:48.440
<v Speaker 1>someone to jail is fitting this academic</v>
<v Speaker 1>school.</v>

81
00:04:48.441 --> 00:04:49.274
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the inquisitorial judicial system added </v>

82
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:52.174
<v Speaker 1>this to the drug trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has already killed more than </v>

83
00:04:53.571 --> 00:04:56.300
<v Speaker 1>200,000 people in just 11 years</v>

84
00:04:58.760 --> 00:04:59.593
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

85
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.100
<v Speaker 1>better understanding in some areas of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

86
00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.650
<v Speaker 1>narcos have more power than the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>

87
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:05.603
<v Speaker 1>and political sciences is called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed state situation and this happens </v>

88
00:05:08.341 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>in many areas of Africa and in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

89
00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Mexica needed more than reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needed a 180 degree turn arounds for </v>

90
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.970
<v Speaker 1>its institutions as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who was the man for this job?</v>

91
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that would be henrique a pen.</v>

92
00:05:23.411 --> 00:05:24.244
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>NASA.</v>

93
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>That his job was to do this when he got </v>
<v Speaker 1>into office in 2012.</v>

94
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.313
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that it's still too early</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Mexicans to notice improvements in </v>

95
00:05:31.021 --> 00:05:33.030
<v Speaker 1>their day to day lives after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms.</v>

96
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.340
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social unrest in Mexico,</v>

97
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>it actually keeps growing</v>

98
00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>and you can add to that the thanks that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenya and yet says,</v>

99
00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.980
<v Speaker 1>worst enemy is actually opinion yet so </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

100
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:46.023
<v Speaker 1>Few people have worked harder to damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>that credibility basically has </v>

101
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One needs to become a hated politician.</v>

102
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.903
<v Speaker 1>Corruption scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fake phd size and lots of </v>

103
00:05:58.311 --> 00:05:59.144
<v Speaker 1>embezzlement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this apparently wasn't enough for </v>

104
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:01.484
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember Donald Trump's election </v>

105
00:06:02.241 --> 00:06:03.074
<v Speaker 1>campaign and you probably do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was messing with Mexico every other </v>

106
00:06:05.181 --> 00:06:06.410
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

107
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not big fans of trump because of</v>

108
00:06:09.351 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Kenya is brilliant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idea was to invite trump for an official</v>

110
00:06:13.511 --> 00:06:14.344
<v Speaker 1>visit even before he became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president and you can probably guess </v>

111
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:22.544
<v Speaker 1>what the reaction of the Mexican people </v>
<v Speaker 1>was and then we got to consider the war </v>

112
00:06:25.221 --> 00:06:28.400
<v Speaker 1>on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Festy jailed El Chapo Guzman who was the</v>

113
00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>Mexican version of Pablo Escobar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>

114
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:33.510
<v Speaker 1>El Chapo escaped from jail via written </v>
<v Speaker 1>all over.</v>

115
00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:35.810
<v Speaker 1>It was so well built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was obvious.</v>

116
00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:39.380
<v Speaker 1>It received help from the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say to sum things up,</v>

117
00:06:39.381 --> 00:06:44.381
<v Speaker 1>Kenya is the man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People love to hate a survey in Mexico.</v>

118
00:06:47.450 --> 00:06:49.830
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the anthro is the Mexican president with</v>

119
00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:52.920
<v Speaker 1>the worst approval rating of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

120
00:06:52.921 --> 00:06:53.754
<v Speaker 1>Kenya and Yetta and administration </v>
<v Speaker 1>epitomizes the public's ultimate </v>

121
00:06:56.391 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>disappointments with the Mexican ruling </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

122
00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.920
<v Speaker 1>So Pri is not to be trusted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pa and is not very exciting either.</v>

123
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:07.010
<v Speaker 1>So the traditional candidates and not </v>
<v Speaker 1>really an option anymore.</v>

124
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's left?</v>

125
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where I'm low,</v>

126
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:12.073
<v Speaker 1>comes in,</v>

127
00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:15.660
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low.</v>

128
00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:16.493
<v Speaker 1>There was a time when emily was a member</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the PRI policy that was in the 19 </v>

129
00:07:19.621 --> 00:07:20.454
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this institutional revolutionary </v>

130
00:07:22.021 --> 00:07:26.000
<v Speaker 1>party was already more institutional </v>
<v Speaker 1>than revolutionary.</v>

131
00:07:26.001 --> 00:07:29.220
<v Speaker 1>Then that's why I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left them and created the party of his</v>

132
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:31.890
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Revolutionary Party,</v>

133
00:07:31.980 --> 00:07:36.360
<v Speaker 1>the stronghold of the true Mexican left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

134
00:07:36.361 --> 00:07:41.361
<v Speaker 1>defeating the PRI was mission impossible</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Sylvia thousands that yet brought the</v>

135
00:07:41.881 --> 00:07:44.910
<v Speaker 1>big crash of the biggest Mexican potty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>

136
00:07:44.911 --> 00:07:48.510
<v Speaker 1>they lost the presidency to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives for another,</v>

137
00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.850
<v Speaker 1>they lost the mayor of the city of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico to unload.</v>

138
00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.033
<v Speaker 1>Becoming the leader of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>metropolol all across Latin America is </v>

139
00:08:00.071 --> 00:08:00.904
<v Speaker 1>not a small deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get a great showcase for your </v>

140
00:08:02.561 --> 00:08:04.990
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why six years later,</v>

141
00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:05.913
<v Speaker 1>I'm low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost won the presidency of the </v>

142
00:08:06.881 --> 00:08:07.690
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I say,</v>

143
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.523
<v Speaker 1>what do you do when you almost win a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national election and have become the </v>

144
00:08:11.741 --> 00:08:13.690
<v Speaker 1>new left wing Rockstar?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.553
<v Speaker 1>you accused the government of election </v>
<v Speaker 1>fraud and organized lots of </v>

146
00:08:16.961 --> 00:08:20.470
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations on the streets and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>let your followers name you fee,</v>

147
00:08:20.610 --> 00:08:24.390
<v Speaker 1>legitimate presidents and family almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>winds this time around.</v>

148
00:08:24.630 --> 00:08:25.463
<v Speaker 1>All of this could happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said in a democracy you can win and </v>

149
00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:33.460
<v Speaker 1>you can lose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this was not a democracy.</v>

150
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Clearly the selection was unfair and </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of irregularities.</v>

151
00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:46.040
<v Speaker 3>He does,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he of,</v>

152
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:52.690
<v Speaker 1>but now we know his history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at his policies.</v>

153
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.553
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angelo wants to undo all of the made by </v>

154
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>previous presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about some examples?</v>

155
00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here we have the energy,</v>

156
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prior to this little,</v>

157
00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>all next oil was managed by these state </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

158
00:09:04.140 --> 00:09:04.973
<v Speaker 1>Pemex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This company itself suffered big losses </v>

159
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:07.344
<v Speaker 1>and we'll kinds of corruption cases and </v>
<v Speaker 1>yet and yet so and his energy bill </v>

160
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:14.460
<v Speaker 1>wanted to end this monopoly so foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies could invest in the country as</v>

161
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>a result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Short term wise,</v>

162
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:19.560
<v Speaker 1>gasoline prices went sky high in just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few months.</v>

163
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:28.600
<v Speaker 1>Timely wants to try and solve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem by giving back to the way things</v>

164
00:09:28.601 --> 00:09:31.180
<v Speaker 1>were before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same goes for the education bill.</v>

165
00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:32.103
<v Speaker 1>Prior to the current Ceville teachers' </v>
<v Speaker 1>unions held a lot of sway over public </v>

166
00:09:34.841 --> 00:09:35.674
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result was lots of protests </v>

167
00:09:37.091 --> 00:09:39.820
<v Speaker 1>organized by those teachers unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

168
00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:40.833
<v Speaker 1>I'm low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to go backwards and make those </v>

169
00:09:42.581 --> 00:09:45.010
<v Speaker 1>teachers happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what about drug trafficking?</v>

170
00:09:45.130 --> 00:09:47.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emily's plans don't stop with ending the</v>

171
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:49.870
<v Speaker 1>war on drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could be kind of reasonable.</v>

172
00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.990
<v Speaker 1>He wants to provide amnesty for the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug kingpin is so called dangerous.</v>

173
00:09:56.231 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Criminals are mere babies compared to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the corrupt politicians,</v>

174
00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.660
<v Speaker 1>but the best of his policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we like to call his magic tricks.</v>

175
00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we end corruption symbol?</v>

176
00:10:07.061 --> 00:10:11.500
<v Speaker 1>We write a so called moral constitution </v>
<v Speaker 1>and remove the illegal immunity that the</v>

177
00:10:11.530 --> 00:10:12.363
<v Speaker 1>members of parliaments currently enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This one is especially funny because </v>

178
00:10:15.221 --> 00:10:16.054
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly the first time that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician has connected those two </v>

179
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.090
<v Speaker 1>principles of corruption and legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunity and guess what?</v>

180
00:10:22.120 --> 00:10:24.310
<v Speaker 1>The least corrupt countries on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

181
00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:27.790
<v Speaker 1>Denmark and New Zealand's have legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>immunity for them,</v>

182
00:10:27.791 --> 00:10:29.440
<v Speaker 1>members of parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then again,</v>

183
00:10:29.441 --> 00:10:30.274
<v Speaker 1>it does seem like a very appealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy for populist politicians </v>

184
00:10:32.891 --> 00:10:33.724
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>

185
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:38.873
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like basically seems to have easy </v>

186
00:10:40.411 --> 00:10:43.230
<v Speaker 1>and quick solutions for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the more examples,</v>

187
00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:44.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youth unemployment easy,</v>

188
00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:45.563
<v Speaker 1>the government will employ thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>youngsters and so on and so forth with </v>

189
00:10:49.471 --> 00:10:53.190
<v Speaker 1>other such examples and other words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>low and his brand new political party,</v>

190
00:10:53.191 --> 00:10:58.191
<v Speaker 1>the so called marina generates a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>sympathy in half of Mexico society and a</v>

191
00:10:58.651 --> 00:10:59.484
<v Speaker 1>lot of fear in the other half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a problem because if you </v>

192
00:11:02.221 --> 00:11:03.054
<v Speaker 1>want to run for office scattering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your enemies might galvanize them on </v>

193
00:11:05.671 --> 00:11:06.504
<v Speaker 1>election day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real question now is to what </v>

194
00:11:08.761 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 1>extent is Amarillo willing to moderate </v>
<v Speaker 1>his agenda,</v>

195
00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.320
<v Speaker 2>popular</v>

196
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.270
<v Speaker 1>or populist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this name,</v>

197
00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Alfonso Romo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a big businessman in Monterrey and </v>

198
00:11:23.841 --> 00:11:27.110
<v Speaker 1>has been hazed by amyloid to become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign spokesperson.</v>

199
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.700
<v Speaker 1>So what's his mission?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:29.563
<v Speaker 1>he's the man in charge of moderating </v>
<v Speaker 1>ambulance policies and making them more </v>

201
00:11:32.781 --> 00:11:36.080
<v Speaker 1>palatable for independent voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all the polls in his favor,</v>

202
00:11:36.090 --> 00:11:36.923
<v Speaker 1>amyloid needs those votes badly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Alfonso Aroma is the man for the </v>

203
00:11:40.641 --> 00:11:41.474
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes from the business wells and </v>

204
00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:45.290
<v Speaker 1>supported conservative candidates in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>past.</v>

205
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:46.273
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of emily's advisors come from </v>

206
00:11:47.691 --> 00:11:50.750
<v Speaker 1>different backgrounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the conservative Pan Party.</v>

207
00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 1>And you can really tell that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>softening rhetoric,</v>

208
00:11:53.400 --> 00:11:54.233
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

209
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.520
<v Speaker 1>Remember how I told you that emily </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to revoke the energy bill?</v>

210
00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:01.410
<v Speaker 1>Well now with phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say Roman was essentially said,</v>

211
00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:02.333
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't so that at the end of the day </v>

212
00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.153
<v Speaker 1>we'll just renegotiate the contracts </v>
<v Speaker 1>with foreign companies that they can </v>

213
00:12:08.101 --> 00:12:08.934
<v Speaker 1>stay in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm low changed as mine and now he says </v>

214
00:12:13.961 --> 00:12:14.794
<v Speaker 1>yes to energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>openness according to our funds or </v>

215
00:12:17.181 --> 00:12:19.450
<v Speaker 1>Oromo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a lot more last minute</v>

216
00:12:19.451 --> 00:12:20.620
<v Speaker 1>moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

217
00:12:20.621 --> 00:12:22.240
<v Speaker 1>Angela is from region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coles,</v>

218
00:12:22.241 --> 00:12:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Tabasco here and the other is a kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fish cold pack.</v>

219
00:12:24.980 --> 00:12:26.950
<v Speaker 1>And that's why some people live in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nicknamed him the pain.</v>

220
00:12:27.010 --> 00:12:30.670
<v Speaker 1>So now in order to give the impression </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he will not nationalized companies,</v>

221
00:12:30.671 --> 00:12:34.090
<v Speaker 1>raised taxes or expropriate properties </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Venezuela and fashion,</v>

222
00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:37.900
<v Speaker 1>he's launched a brand new economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>agenda called payer nomics.</v>

223
00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:44.380
<v Speaker 1>No money is a big fan of risks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments.</v>

224
00:12:44.470 --> 00:12:45.303
<v Speaker 1>And with or without flashy names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican businessman doesn't really </v>

225
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:48.370
<v Speaker 1>trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like,</v>

226
00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:51.100
<v Speaker 1>this is why while the elections are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting closer and closer,</v>

227
00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.140
<v Speaker 1>this group has already found it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>canceled.</v>

228
00:12:56.290 --> 00:12:57.123
<v Speaker 1>DEB's against this Mexico and like other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like France has no second </v>

229
00:13:00.191 --> 00:13:02.230
<v Speaker 1>rounds during the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

230
00:13:02.350 --> 00:13:03.183
<v Speaker 1>That means that the candidate with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest share of the voters on July the </v>

231
00:13:06.221 --> 00:13:07.054
<v Speaker 1>first will become the presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why it seems that the </v>

232
00:13:09.370 --> 00:13:13.210
<v Speaker 1>biggest antagonist to Amarillo is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be the conservative candidates,</v>

233
00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo and Naya,</v>

234
00:13:17.240 --> 00:13:18.073
<v Speaker 1>the Mexican business elite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will support in order to stop Lopez </v>

235
00:13:21.710 --> 00:13:25.250
<v Speaker 1>Obrador being 39 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I was the youngest candidate in this</v>

236
00:13:25.251 --> 00:13:27.140
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's been accused of money laundering,</v>

237
00:13:27.141 --> 00:13:29.660
<v Speaker 1>but this hasn't actually hurt him during</v>
<v Speaker 1>the campaign.</v>

238
00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.430
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite the opposite is true.</v>

239
00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:32.323
<v Speaker 1>People believe that this was just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dirty trick played by the PRI to </v>

240
00:13:34.881 --> 00:13:35.714
<v Speaker 1>disqualify him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven dd is gaining momentum in the </v>

241
00:13:37.221 --> 00:13:38.054
<v Speaker 1>polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although he still has a long way to go </v>

242
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.030
<v Speaker 1>in order to pass ambler.</v>

243
00:13:43.830 --> 00:13:44.663
<v Speaker 1>So now the big question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you believe amyloid will become the </v>

244
00:13:46.381 --> 00:13:49.860
<v Speaker 1>next Mexican presidents and neither can </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually beat him?</v>

245
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:54.540
<v Speaker 1>Is amyloid risks to Mexico or is it hard</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do worse than previous presidents?</v>

246
00:13:54.570 --> 00:13:55.403
