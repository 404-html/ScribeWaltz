1
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:09.383
<v Speaker 1>I think nobody will be surprised if I </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that immigration is one of the most </v>

2
00:00:11.821 --> 00:00:12.654
<v Speaker 1>important issues in international </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and certainly both in Europe </v>

3
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.394
<v Speaker 1>and in the United States lately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything related to this issue takes </v>

4
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>over most of the news and the front </v>
<v Speaker 1>pages of the newspapers.</v>

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.290
<v Speaker 2>Immigration was the fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of the problems that were happening.</v>

6
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.333
<v Speaker 2>What the administration has decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>do is to separate children from their </v>

7
00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:38.721
<v Speaker 2>parents to try to send a message that if</v>
<v Speaker 2>you crossed the border with children,</v>

8
00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.880
<v Speaker 2>your children are going to be ripped </v>
<v Speaker 2>away from you.</v>

9
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.773
<v Speaker 2>That's traumatizing to the children for </v>
<v Speaker 2>innocent victims and it is contrary to </v>

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:49.403
<v Speaker 2>our values and this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States will not be a migrant </v>

11
00:00:53.701 --> 00:00:58.701
<v Speaker 2>camp and it will not be a refugee </v>
<v Speaker 2>holding facility will be because will be</v>

12
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 2>able to push that open door space at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia when she got down to granted.</v>

13
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Granted all window,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not deep</v>

14
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.790
<v Speaker 1>without going any further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are visual politic.</v>

15
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.643
<v Speaker 1>We've already spoken a few times about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this objects and soon we're going to </v>

16
00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:29.324
<v Speaker 1>post a special video first on our </v>
<v Speaker 1>Patrion and then on youtube commenting </v>

17
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:35.114
<v Speaker 1>and dismantling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the myths and half truths that </v>

18
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.623
<v Speaker 1>exist on this subject,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just before we get into the meat of </v>

19
00:01:40.941 --> 00:01:42.440
<v Speaker 1>today's video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking of Patriot on,</v>

20
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.274
<v Speaker 1>let me thank everyone who is supporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>us on Patrion and everyone who just </v>

21
00:01:45.561 --> 00:01:48.320
<v Speaker 1>watches us whereabouts across the half </v>
<v Speaker 1>million subscriber mark,</v>

22
00:01:48.321 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>so that's pretty amazing and we couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that without you,</v>

23
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.890
<v Speaker 1>especially the people who do support us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Like I say on Patrion.</v>

24
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.753
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are now publishing 50 percent more </v>

25
00:01:57.381 --> 00:02:01.400
<v Speaker 1>videos and we're now preparing lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprises and of course all of the other</v>

26
00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:03.290
<v Speaker 1>things that we have promised you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>

27
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.153
<v Speaker 1>let's just crack on you at this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to share some reflections with </v>

28
00:02:19.741 --> 00:02:20.574
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some ideas which I think we should keep </v>

29
00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.720
<v Speaker 1>in mind when we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>

30
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.410
<v Speaker 1>This is particularly important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we consider that lately mistrust,</v>

31
00:02:28.411 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>fear and anti-immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political speeches.</v>

32
00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the very much alive</v>

33
00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.133
<v Speaker 3>get out of my country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I can still hear that sentence with </v>

34
00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.190
<v Speaker 3>absolute clarity as if it occupies a </v>
<v Speaker 3>specific place in my mind.</v>

35
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.650
<v Speaker 3>It's a scar deep within.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The man who said,</v>

36
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.500
<v Speaker 3>get out of my country was a trump </v>
<v Speaker 3>supporter.</v>

37
00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.270
<v Speaker 3>I know this because he was wearing a pin</v>
<v Speaker 3>identifying the then candidate on one of</v>

38
00:02:51.271 --> 00:02:52.770
<v Speaker 3>his lapels,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most of all,</v>

39
00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 3>I know this because of the way he said </v>
<v Speaker 3>it to me.</v>

40
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.290
<v Speaker 3>He looked me straight in the eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>pointed a finger at me and shouted,</v>

41
00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 3>or he a journalist</v>

42
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>from univision and a US citizen who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in Mexico.</v>

43
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.993
<v Speaker 1>One of the most typical and popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments of those who oppose </v>

44
00:03:06.941 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 1>immigration is stating that immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>take odd jobs and take the money back to</v>

45
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>their own countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

46
00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:15.010
<v Speaker 1>as long as we're not talking about messy</v>
<v Speaker 1>you Christiane,</v>

47
00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.853
<v Speaker 1>or analogy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know doll or maybe the writing stones </v>

48
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.290
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's no problem,</v>

49
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.960
<v Speaker 1>which is perhaps a bit hypocritical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

50
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:24.160
<v Speaker 1>So now we come to the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

51
00:03:24.161 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>why do people decide to emigrate?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who are these people who pack their bags</v>

52
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:30.003
<v Speaker 1>and leave their land?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who benefits from all of these </v>

53
00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:32.740
<v Speaker 1>movements?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in general,</v>

54
00:03:32.741 --> 00:03:36.280
<v Speaker 1>why is that such a negative perception </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this phenomenon?</v>

55
00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.173
<v Speaker 1>Well then this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to try and answer some of </v>

56
00:03:38.831 --> 00:03:39.664
<v Speaker 1>those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first I think it's time we took a </v>

57
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.200
<v Speaker 1>look back at how it all began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when,</v>

58
00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.580
<v Speaker 1>why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and where.</v>

59
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.460
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would you say if I told you that in</v>

60
00:03:48.461 --> 00:03:51.880
<v Speaker 1>some way your also an immigrants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:52.803
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The origin from the very beginnings of </v>

62
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.700
<v Speaker 1>humanity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people moved.</v>

63
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:08.573
<v Speaker 1>Basically their motivation was to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>food which forced them to move </v>

64
00:04:11.551 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>continuously from one place to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

65
00:04:14.311 --> 00:04:15.144
<v Speaker 1>back then borders didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only limitation to moving from one </v>

66
00:04:18.421 --> 00:04:21.510
<v Speaker 1>place to another with how far one could </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel.</v>

67
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.763
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all this began to change when modern </v>

68
00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.583
<v Speaker 1>societies emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is when communities settled in a </v>

69
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:31.974
<v Speaker 1>particular place where they worked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce food tools and everything they </v>

70
00:04:35.281 --> 00:04:36.930
<v Speaker 1>needed to trade to live.</v>

71
00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.630
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

72
00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:46.370
<v Speaker 1>One thing we can ask ourselves here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>did the migration phenomenon disappeared</v>

73
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:48.770
<v Speaker 1>with this new way of life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:49.663
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

75
00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 1>Once the first modern societies </v>
<v Speaker 1>established themselves in certain places</v>

76
00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and governments began to emerge back </v>
<v Speaker 1>around 3000 BC,</v>

77
00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:01.663
<v Speaker 1>migration didn't stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the motivations did change to large </v>

78
00:05:06.111 --> 00:05:08.360
<v Speaker 1>migration groups were created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>

79
00:05:08.361 --> 00:05:10.760
<v Speaker 1>to groups with really different </v>
<v Speaker 1>motivations.</v>

80
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand that was conquering and </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hands,</v>

81
00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>there was searching for opportunities.</v>

82
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:16.860
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

83
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:20.333
<v Speaker 1>the first conquest swerve movements </v>
<v Speaker 1>carried out by societies that had </v>

84
00:05:23.131 --> 00:05:23.964
<v Speaker 1>achieved a higher level of developments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who wanted to take advantage of it </v>

85
00:05:26.731 --> 00:05:28.880
<v Speaker 1>to gain wealth from the people they call</v>
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

86
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:29.793
<v Speaker 4>good</v>

87
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.473
<v Speaker 1>involved a migratory movement from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most developed countries to the less </v>

88
00:05:38.751 --> 00:05:41.230
<v Speaker 1>developed countries to monopolize their </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

89
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.750
<v Speaker 1>Although this phenomenon wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusive to any continent,</v>

90
00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:47.613
<v Speaker 1>the case that we all know best is </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps that of the Europeans who </v>

91
00:05:50.801 --> 00:05:55.030
<v Speaker 1>managed to control almost the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>world starting with America,</v>

92
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:56.680
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this type of migration,</v>

93
00:05:56.710 --> 00:05:59.660
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't look anything like the </v>
<v Speaker 1>migration that we have today.</v>

94
00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.480
<v Speaker 1>The second type of migration though it </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly does.</v>

95
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:03.343
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobilization of millions of people who </v>

96
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.583
<v Speaker 1>seek to escape that territory of origin </v>
<v Speaker 1>to reach another territory where they </v>

97
00:06:10.071 --> 00:06:15.071
<v Speaker 1>can find new and better opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

98
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.244
<v Speaker 1>their drive is to search for economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvements and sometimes also to </v>

99
00:06:19.581 --> 00:06:22.130
<v Speaker 1>escape political and religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>persecution.</v>

100
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in general,</v>

101
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.374
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about peaceful migrations </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the least developed countries to </v>

102
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:28.753
<v Speaker 1>the most developed countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something like the opposite of </v>

103
00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:36.581
<v Speaker 1>conquest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first launch case happens at the end</v>

104
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:39.183
<v Speaker 1>of the Middle Ages when cities grew and </v>
<v Speaker 1>people began to leave the country side </v>

105
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.430
<v Speaker 1>to move to these cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many case this,</v>

106
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.293
<v Speaker 1>it was a really slow process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything changed with the arrival </v>

107
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>of the industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's estimated between 1850 and 1930,</v>

108
00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:00.354
<v Speaker 1>almost $60 million Europeans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was a huge percentage of the </v>

109
00:07:03.331 --> 00:07:06.780
<v Speaker 1>population at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emigrated to the Americas countries like</v>

110
00:07:06.781 --> 00:07:07.950
<v Speaker 1>the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

111
00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:09.240
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Argentina.</v>

112
00:07:12.100 --> 00:07:13.690
<v Speaker 4>That's is</v>

113
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:14.693
<v Speaker 1>to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all the political discourse </v>

114
00:07:16.191 --> 00:07:17.024
<v Speaker 1>against immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that Europe has a well </v>

115
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>defined history as an emigrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

116
00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Europeans first emigrated massively from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the countryside to the cities.</v>

117
00:07:25.791 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>Then they moved around the wells and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>now in our times.</v>

118
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.103
<v Speaker 1>Millions and millions of Europeans have </v>
<v Speaker 1>left their lands to live in another </v>

119
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.993
<v Speaker 1>European Union country.</v>

120
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:40.290
<v Speaker 1>And what about the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all of its population,</v>

121
00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:41.183
<v Speaker 1>if not all of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from other countries or lives in </v>

122
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.420
<v Speaker 1>territories that belonged to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

123
00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 1>as is the case of the lands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

124
00:07:47.610 --> 00:07:50.700
<v Speaker 1>New Mexico and Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which historically belonged to Mexico.</v>

125
00:07:52.740 --> 00:07:56.400
<v Speaker 1>So in a way we're all really the </v>
<v Speaker 1>descendants of immigrants.</v>

126
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.263
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we take the current anti immigration </v>

127
00:07:58.861 --> 00:07:59.694
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations TV extreme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could state that we are all </v>

128
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:05.340
<v Speaker 1>immigrants in the regions in which we </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>

129
00:08:05.370 --> 00:08:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question we must ask is,</v>

130
00:08:07.471 --> 00:08:08.304
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the consequences of all of </v>

131
00:08:09.181 --> 00:08:10.014
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could it have something to do with the </v>

132
00:08:10.831 --> 00:08:11.664
<v Speaker 1>fact that most of the richest and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed countries in the wells have </v>

133
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:18.000
<v Speaker 1>been exposed to the migratory process?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:18.863
<v Speaker 1>listen up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what history tells us what's that loud </v>

135
00:08:30.611 --> 00:08:31.444
<v Speaker 1>or say a clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most immigrants share a common goal to </v>

136
00:08:34.481 --> 00:08:37.990
<v Speaker 1>achieve a better life and more progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>

137
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:38.853
<v Speaker 1>some people with deep pockets or a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>standard of living move from their </v>

138
00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:41.944
<v Speaker 1>country to grow professionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have new experiences or maybe just live </v>

139
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.430
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These immigrants who usually arrive with</v>

140
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:52.490
<v Speaker 1>a full wallet almost never awakened </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone's mistrust.</v>

141
00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same does not</v>

142
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 5>apply to people who are escaping hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 5>misery,</v>

143
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 5>all kinds of political,</v>
<v Speaker 5>religious,</v>

144
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:02.364
<v Speaker 5>and social prosecutions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>These are immigrants who arrive with an </v>

145
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:07.890
<v Speaker 5>empty wallet in search of new </v>
<v Speaker 5>opportunities.</v>

146
00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.763
<v Speaker 5>This type of immigration is by far the </v>
<v Speaker 5>most important and of course the one </v>

147
00:09:11.521 --> 00:09:14.890
<v Speaker 5>that generates the greatest mistrust,</v>
<v Speaker 5>hostility and criticism.</v>

148
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:17.453
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this immigration is almost identical to </v>

149
00:09:19.231 --> 00:09:20.064
<v Speaker 1>our ancestors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talking about people who are risking </v>

150
00:09:22.051 --> 00:09:24.980
<v Speaker 1>their lives and who decided to leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything behind,</v>

151
00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.530
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly not easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all for what?</v>

152
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.423
<v Speaker 1>Well the same as always do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve a better future to work and to </v>

153
00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>prosper in a lawful way.</v>

154
00:09:36.070 --> 00:09:36.903
<v Speaker 3>It'll is more extraordinary than the </v>
<v Speaker 3>decision to migrate the accumulation of </v>

155
00:09:40.431 --> 00:09:41.264
<v Speaker 3>emotions and thoughts which finally </v>
<v Speaker 3>leads a family to say farewell to a </v>

156
00:09:44.481 --> 00:09:45.314
<v Speaker 3>community where it has lived for </v>
<v Speaker 3>centuries to abandon old ties and </v>

157
00:09:48.501 --> 00:09:53.501
<v Speaker 3>familiar landmarks and to sail across.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Doc sees to a strange land.</v>

158
00:09:53.810 --> 00:09:54.643
<v Speaker 3>John F Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the United States of </v>

159
00:09:56.750 --> 00:09:56.940
<v Speaker 3>America.</v>

160
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.773
<v Speaker 1>Tell me who built America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who promoted the extraordinary economic </v>

161
00:10:01.141 --> 00:10:01.974
<v Speaker 1>take off this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina saw at the end of the 19th </v>

162
00:10:04.231 --> 00:10:05.310
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.173
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the immigrants and the </v>

164
00:10:07.321 --> 00:10:08.154
<v Speaker 1>descendants of the immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why do we think of things as </v>

165
00:10:11.161 --> 00:10:15.700
<v Speaker 1>different today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course,</v>

166
00:10:15.701 --> 00:10:16.534
<v Speaker 1>when economic data shows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration drives growth and </v>

167
00:10:18.671 --> 00:10:19.650
<v Speaker 1>development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do youtube,</v>

168
00:10:19.660 --> 00:10:22.480
<v Speaker 1>higher employment levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship and productivity,</v>

169
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:24.850
<v Speaker 1>then anti-immigration critics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

170
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:25.773
<v Speaker 1>they make up other excuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk about them one by </v>

171
00:10:30.971 --> 00:10:33.250
<v Speaker 1>one in a future video with data and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

172
00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:34.084
<v Speaker 1>but today I'd like to end this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a reflection on one of the most </v>

173
00:10:37.691 --> 00:10:40.390
<v Speaker 1>important myths,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fear and crime.</v>

174
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:55.090
<v Speaker 6>When Mexico sends its people,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're not sending their best.</v>

175
00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:58.600
<v Speaker 6>They're not sending you.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They're sending people that have lots of</v>

176
00:10:58.601 --> 00:11:01.570
<v Speaker 6>problems and they're bringing those </v>
<v Speaker 6>problems with us.</v>

177
00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:04.390
<v Speaker 6>They're bringing drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 6>they're bringing crime,</v>

178
00:11:04.420 --> 00:11:05.350
<v Speaker 6>they're rapists.</v>

179
00:11:05.390 --> 00:11:08.600
<v Speaker 1>One of the most widely spread myths is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that immigrants,</v>

180
00:11:08.630 --> 00:11:11.960
<v Speaker 1>especially undocumented immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called illegals,</v>

181
00:11:12.020 --> 00:11:15.380
<v Speaker 1>are the ones responsible for most crimes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and delinquency.</v>

182
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

183
00:11:16.370 --> 00:11:19.130
<v Speaker 1>The data actually says that the opposite</v>
<v Speaker 1>is true.</v>

184
00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:19.993
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that there are legal and </v>

185
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:23.840
<v Speaker 1>illegal immigrants who commit crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

186
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:24.703
<v Speaker 1>let's look at an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's look at what happens in the </v>

187
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.730
<v Speaker 1>country with the most immigrants in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

188
00:11:28.810 --> 00:11:33.810
<v Speaker 1>The United States say between 1990 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>2013,</v>

189
00:11:34.621 --> 00:11:35.454
<v Speaker 1>the number of undocumented immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as illegal immigrants went from </v>

190
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:41.550
<v Speaker 1>three and a half million people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately 11 million.</v>

191
00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that same period,</v>

192
00:11:42.751 --> 00:11:43.584
<v Speaker 1>according to the FBI,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of violent crimes dropped by </v>

193
00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:50.810
<v Speaker 1>48 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprised well,</v>

194
00:11:51.190 --> 00:11:54.550
<v Speaker 1>if we take the crime data into accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he really shouldn't be.</v>

195
00:11:54.610 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>So according to an immigration policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>center study,</v>

196
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:01.560
<v Speaker 1>only one point six percent of immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 1>men aged 18 to 39 end up in prison.</v>

197
00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:06.430
<v Speaker 1>Among those born in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the data is three point three percent,</v>

198
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:10.780
<v Speaker 1>so more than double Jack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This graph on crime levels in taxes,</v>

199
00:12:10.781 --> 00:12:14.290
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the states with the most</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal and illegal immigrants.</v>

200
00:12:20.990 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can agree that we need to reorder the</v>

201
00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:24.704
<v Speaker 1>migratory processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but stigmatizing immigrants and </v>

202
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:30.680
<v Speaker 1>outlawing their condition only favors </v>
<v Speaker 1>the human trafficking.</v>

203
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Matthews,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence is clear.</v>

204
00:12:33.111 --> 00:12:33.944
<v Speaker 1>Immigrants trying to reach countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>with high levels of freedom and more </v>

205
00:12:36.561 --> 00:12:37.394
<v Speaker 1>open economic systems in shorts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>places where they can work and enjoy </v>

206
00:12:40.881 --> 00:12:42.080
<v Speaker 1>life without fear.</v>

207
00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:45.313
<v Speaker 1>Therefore perhaps a good measure and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the only one to control the </v>

208
00:12:48.441 --> 00:12:50.750
<v Speaker 1>migrator reflow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a remote trade,</v>

209
00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:51.673
<v Speaker 1>private investments and democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions in the countries that </v>

210
00:12:54.201 --> 00:12:56.810
<v Speaker 1>people are leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's meanwhile developed countries can</v>

211
00:12:56.811 --> 00:12:57.644
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of immigration in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same way as other societies throughout </v>

212
00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.170
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants view,</v>

213
00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.033
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to work and then wants to </v>

214
00:13:04.521 --> 00:13:05.354
<v Speaker 1>prosper,</v>

215
00:13:07.690 --> 00:13:07.910
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
