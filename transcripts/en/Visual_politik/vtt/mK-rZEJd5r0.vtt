1
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:08.733
<v Speaker 1>I think there's one thing here we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>all agree on the Internet has certainly </v>

2
00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.650
<v Speaker 1>changed our lives so much so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to statistics,</v>

3
00:00:14.651 --> 00:00:19.120
<v Speaker 1>three out of every four Americans can't </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine life without music,</v>

4
00:00:19.121 --> 00:00:20.060
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shopping ads,</v>

5
00:00:20.061 --> 00:00:22.150
<v Speaker 1>especially video services such as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform.</v>

6
00:00:22.151 --> 00:00:22.984
<v Speaker 1>Youtube have huge amounts of data </v>
<v Speaker 1>flowing through them every day and it </v>

7
00:00:26.561 --> 00:00:27.670
<v Speaker 1>just keeps growing.</v>

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.710
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:32.763
<v Speaker 3>that would be a plan for the Amazon is </v>
<v Speaker 3>giving the delivery guy spare key all </v>

10
00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:45.101
<v Speaker 3>the apps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>gps video when classroom connecting with</v>

11
00:00:45.531 --> 00:00:48.680
<v Speaker 3>another one continent in four time zones</v>
<v Speaker 3>away,</v>

12
00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 3>initials at the US State Department.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're so concerned about the anti Muslim</v>

13
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:55.420
<v Speaker 3>videos that president trump retweeted </v>
<v Speaker 3>yesterday.</v>

14
00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.350
<v Speaker 1>According to Cisco's estimates just in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next five years alone,</v>

15
00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 1>the United States will multiply its </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet traffic by three.</v>

16
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2015,</v>

17
00:01:13.181 --> 00:01:14.014
<v Speaker 1>the United States matched and surpassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea becoming the world's leader </v>

18
00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:19.050
<v Speaker 1>per capita in data consumption.</v>

19
00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.953
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

20
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.213
<v Speaker 1>and of course the Internet's this great </v>
<v Speaker 1>virtual world is becoming more </v>

21
00:01:27.121 --> 00:01:27.954
<v Speaker 1>integrated with on lives to making up an</v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly larger share of our </v>

22
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:33.390
<v Speaker 1>economic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So based on all of this,</v>

23
00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:38.391
<v Speaker 1>you can probably imagine two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

24
00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:40.663
<v Speaker 1>the massive amounts of infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>required by all of this consumption and </v>

25
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important Internet regulation is.</v>

26
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the 14th of December 2017,</v>

27
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:50.384
<v Speaker 1>the federal communications commission of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States made a decision that </v>

28
00:01:53.091 --> 00:01:53.924
<v Speaker 1>could well be described as historic due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to its transcendence and above all it's </v>

29
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:00.170
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you may know,</v>

30
00:02:00.171 --> 00:02:01.004
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Communications Commission </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided by three votes against two to </v>

31
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.503
<v Speaker 1>end so-called net neutrality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one really is sure what will happen </v>

32
00:02:09.531 --> 00:02:12.890
<v Speaker 1>now that the government has changed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rules governing the worldwide.</v>

33
00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.190
<v Speaker 1>This regulation was approved in 2015 at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the request of President Obama himself.</v>

34
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that right?</v>

35
00:02:24.391 --> 00:02:25.224
<v Speaker 1>The regulation known as net neutrality </v>
<v Speaker 1>was born in 2015 within a short time </v>

36
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.233
<v Speaker 1>twisted the media and practically every </v>
<v Speaker 1>debate space was covered with this </v>

37
00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.320
<v Speaker 1>message with facing the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet.</v>

38
00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.243
<v Speaker 1>As we know.</v>

39
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.770
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man is a GPI chairman of the United</v>

40
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>States is federal communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission.</v>

41
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 1>And this story is main protagonists or </v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say antagonist.</v>

42
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.583
<v Speaker 1>What we've decided is that we need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restore the light touch market based </v>

43
00:02:52.921 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>framework that started in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

44
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.890
<v Speaker 1>He is also probably one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>hated people on the Internet.</v>

45
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.090
<v Speaker 1>Well then maybe a couple of questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to answer here.</v>

46
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.953
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what was this regulation fundamentally </v>

47
00:03:03.611 --> 00:03:07.090
<v Speaker 1>about and seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this change really mean?</v>

48
00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.430
<v Speaker 1>What am I going to do in DC?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For two years,</v>

49
00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:16.530
<v Speaker 1>CNC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand and 15,</v>

50
00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.373
<v Speaker 1>it was decided that the Internet would </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass from being regulated by the first </v>

51
00:03:20.021 --> 00:03:23.140
<v Speaker 1>title of the communications locked to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the second title.</v>

52
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:24.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that doesn't really help us,</v>

53
00:03:24.251 --> 00:03:26.600
<v Speaker 1>so what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

54
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.800
<v Speaker 1>so you understand this better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say that with this change,</v>

55
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:30.643
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the service provision starting </v>

56
00:03:32.441 --> 00:03:33.274
<v Speaker 1>to be considered a public service and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be strongly regulated by the government </v>

57
00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:37.143
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Federal Communications </v>

58
00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 1>Commission.</v>

59
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:40.123
<v Speaker 4>Ever since the Internet was created,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's been organized around basic </v>

60
00:03:43.221 --> 00:03:45.140
<v Speaker 4>principles of openness,</v>
<v Speaker 4>fairness,</v>

61
00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.210
<v Speaker 4>and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This set of principles,</v>

62
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.403
<v Speaker 4>the idea of net and Trello,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it has unleashed the power of the </v>

63
00:03:50.721 --> 00:03:53.510
<v Speaker 4>Internet and given innovators that </v>
<v Speaker 4>chance to thrive,</v>

64
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.613
<v Speaker 4>abandoning these principles would </v>
<v Speaker 4>threaten to end the internet as we know </v>

65
00:03:57.741 --> 00:03:58.020
<v Speaker 4>it.</v>

66
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.100
<v Speaker 1>This is a regulation that among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things prevented American operators such</v>

67
00:04:01.101 --> 00:04:02.250
<v Speaker 1>as call Mecosta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>verizon,</v>

68
00:04:02.251 --> 00:04:04.770
<v Speaker 1>or atnt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from being able to on the one hand block</v>

69
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 1>or slow down certain web spaces or </v>
<v Speaker 1>applications.</v>

70
00:04:07.351 --> 00:04:08.184
<v Speaker 1>Traffic ends on the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents other content providers from </v>

71
00:04:10.951 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>being preferred.</v>

72
00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:14.410
<v Speaker 4>They should make it clear that whether </v>
<v Speaker 4>you use a computer,</v>

73
00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:15.303
<v Speaker 4>phone,</v>
<v Speaker 4>or tablet,</v>

74
00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:16.293
<v Speaker 4>Internet providers have a legal </v>
<v Speaker 4>obligation not to block or limit your </v>

75
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 4>access to a website.</v>

76
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if a company decided to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority to Netflix over hbo or a </v>

77
00:04:24.311 --> 00:04:27.740
<v Speaker 1>company that told spotify they needed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay if they wanted their customers to be</v>

78
00:04:27.741 --> 00:04:30.110
<v Speaker 1>able to use their music services at high</v>
<v Speaker 1>school</v>

79
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.973
<v Speaker 2>speed</v>

80
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.213
<v Speaker 1>with this regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies at once able to charge fees </v>

81
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.050
<v Speaker 1>that didn't include access to a certain </v>
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>

82
00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

83
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.903
<v Speaker 1>if a business wants at a high speed </v>
<v Speaker 1>connection that didn't consume netflix </v>

84
00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.983
<v Speaker 1>prime video or hbo videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wouldn't matter because with this </v>

85
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:49.450
<v Speaker 1>previous regulation that have to pay for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire service,</v>

86
00:04:49.451 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 1>the operators wouldn't be able to offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>a rate without nationally</v>

87
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.703
<v Speaker 2>x</v>

88
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:55.610
<v Speaker 1>interview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

89
00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 1>this has all changed in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

90
00:04:57.921 --> 00:05:00.110
<v Speaker 1>Companies can now freely determine their</v>
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>

91
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.973
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by offering an internet that doesn't </v>

92
00:05:02.601 --> 00:05:04.700
<v Speaker 1>include being able to watch four k </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos.</v>

93
00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean that they will,</v>

94
00:05:06.291 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 1>but we will probably see different rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>and merge and it is basically this which</v>

95
00:05:10.461 --> 00:05:13.070
<v Speaker 1>caused such controversy on the Internet.</v>

96
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:22.530
<v Speaker 2>It was so cool</v>

97
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:23.363
<v Speaker 1>virtual that only 107 out of the 239 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republican congressmen in the House of </v>

98
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Representatives have made their support </v>
<v Speaker 1>for this decision public.</v>

99
00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:32.660
<v Speaker 1>But do you think this is really that </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad?</v>

100
00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:35.390
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the Internet will no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer be the same?</v>

101
00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:36.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this video we want to show you the </v>

102
00:05:36.681 --> 00:05:40.400
<v Speaker 1>various arguments for and against net </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrality,</v>

103
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.500
<v Speaker 1>Internet threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the dark side.</v>

104
00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.790
<v Speaker 1>The reasons why net neutrality defenders</v>
<v Speaker 1>consider this change to be so negative,</v>

105
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>these points aren't by fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it won't take very long.</v>

106
00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:04.620
<v Speaker 1>Those who detracts from the change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party promoted base their</v>

107
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:05.463
<v Speaker 1>position on two key arguments first that</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that operators can now charge </v>

108
00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:10.164
<v Speaker 1>extra to both companies and customers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of the Internet will go up in </v>

109
00:06:12.901 --> 00:06:13.734
<v Speaker 1>many small businesses and startups won't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to compete with the larger ones </v>

110
00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:17.063
<v Speaker 1>because they won't be able to pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>preferential access seconds because it </v>

111
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:22.890
<v Speaker 1>involves the ends of the freedom on </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the Internet was built.</v>

112
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:23.783
<v Speaker 1>Imagine if an operator decided to slow </v>
<v Speaker 1>down or even block access to a means of </v>

113
00:06:26.791 --> 00:06:28.200
<v Speaker 1>communication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Theoretically,</v>

114
00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.760
<v Speaker 1>this could now happen.</v>

115
00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.583
<v Speaker 3>Our Internet economy is the envy of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world because it is open to all this </v>

116
00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:35.364
<v Speaker 3>proposal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tears at the foundation of that </v>

117
00:06:36.601 --> 00:06:38.790
<v Speaker 3>openness,</v>
<v Speaker 3>enhanced broadband providers.</v>

118
00:06:38.791 --> 00:06:41.070
<v Speaker 3>The power to decide what voices to </v>
<v Speaker 3>amplify,</v>

119
00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.710
<v Speaker 3>which sites we can visit,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what connections we can make,</v>

120
00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.040
<v Speaker 3>and what communities we create.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It throttles access stalls,</v>

121
00:06:47.041 --> 00:06:48.900
<v Speaker 3>opportunity and sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Content.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Jessica Rosenworcel,</v>
<v Speaker 3>member of the Federal Communications </v>

<v Speaker 3>Commission bus</v>

124
00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:54.163
<v Speaker 1>probably well versed on these arguments </v>
<v Speaker 1>already considering how often they've </v>

125
00:06:56.901 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 1>been used in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they view?</v>

126
00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:00.410
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know that here are </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>

127
00:07:00.411 --> 00:07:01.244
<v Speaker 1>We'd like to dig a little deeper so this</v>
<v Speaker 1>time we also wanted to take a look at </v>

128
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:06.380
<v Speaker 1>the net neutralities detractors side </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying,</v>

129
00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's go for it</v>

130
00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.013
<v Speaker 3>also cow.</v>

131
00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:22.910
<v Speaker 1>Those who support ending so called net </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrality have a clear perspective,</v>

132
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.773
<v Speaker 1>a very competitive market as the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>driver for innovation and ensuring good </v>

133
00:07:26.631 --> 00:07:30.370
<v Speaker 1>customer service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one thing is certain.</v>

134
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Literally the Internet emerged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It grew and developed fundamentally as a</v>

135
00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:38.340
<v Speaker 1>free space without the regulation known </v>
<v Speaker 1>as net neutrality.</v>

136
00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.113
<v Speaker 1>This is what Marc Andreessen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>netscape co founder and a key figure in </v>

137
00:07:44.251 --> 00:07:46.490
<v Speaker 1>facebook's birth says on the subjects.</v>

138
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:50.060
<v Speaker 3>A pure net neutrality view is difficult </v>
<v Speaker 3>to sustain.</v>

139
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:53.240
<v Speaker 3>If you also want to have continued </v>
<v Speaker 3>investment in broadband networks.</v>

140
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.560
<v Speaker 3>If you have these pure net neutrality </v>
<v Speaker 3>rules,</v>

141
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 3>Rican never charge a company like </v>
<v Speaker 3>Netflix.</v>

142
00:07:57.471 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 3>Anything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You're not ever going to get a return on</v>

143
00:08:00.441 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 3>continued network investment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which means you'll stop investing in the</v>

144
00:08:03.231 --> 00:08:04.064
<v Speaker 3>network and it would not want to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>sitting here 10 or 20 years from now </v>

145
00:08:06.841 --> 00:08:09.050
<v Speaker 3>with the same broadband speeds we're </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting today.</v>

146
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:11.810
<v Speaker 3>Marc Andreessen medscapes cofounder.</v>

147
00:08:11.990 --> 00:08:12.823
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the main criticisms they </v>

148
00:08:14.331 --> 00:08:15.164
<v Speaker 1>have used to support this change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regulation discourages companies from </v>

149
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.260
<v Speaker 1>investing as we've seen before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet traffic in the U,</v>

150
00:08:24.631 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>s has grown from Mendocino and recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

151
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:27.614
<v Speaker 1>How surprisingly investments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>broadband infrastructure has stagnated </v>

152
00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:33.470
<v Speaker 1>and even decreased in the same span of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

153
00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:42.510
<v Speaker 1>This obviously isn't normal and it fuels</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the sectors,</v>

154
00:08:42.570 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 1>main problems in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lack of competition in many</v>

155
00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:47.244
<v Speaker 1>parts,</v>

156
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 2>but of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if regulation</v>

157
00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:59.730
<v Speaker 1>hinders and reduces the business's </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential profitability,</v>

158
00:08:59.760 --> 00:09:03.090
<v Speaker 1>investment incentives are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially reduced.</v>

159
00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.290
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty logical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

160
00:09:04.350 --> 00:09:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Another points claims by those </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting the end to Obama's regulation</v>

161
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 1>is that regulation could not only hurt </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

162
00:09:10.441 --> 00:09:12.960
<v Speaker 1>but it was also completely unnecessary.</v>

163
00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Twenty years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Internet has thrived under the light</v>

164
00:09:16.801 --> 00:09:17.634
<v Speaker 3>touch regulatory approach established by</v>
<v Speaker 3>President Clinton and a Republican </v>

165
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:21.264
<v Speaker 3>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This bipartisan framework with the </v>

166
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:23.664
<v Speaker 3>private sector to invest one point 5 </v>
<v Speaker 3>trillion building communications </v>

167
00:09:26.551 --> 00:09:27.384
<v Speaker 3>networks throughout the United States </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it gave us an internet economy that </v>

168
00:09:29.971 --> 00:09:32.310
<v Speaker 3>became the envy of the world at Gte pie</v>

169
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.263
<v Speaker 1>according to the supporters in the 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years before net neutrality that is </v>

170
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:37.044
<v Speaker 1>between 1995 and 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet access only expanded and </v>

171
00:09:40.561 --> 00:09:45.450
<v Speaker 1>improved in speed and quality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Around this time.</v>

172
00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.400
<v Speaker 1>The big digital companies we know today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>

173
00:09:47.401 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix,</v>

174
00:09:48.450 --> 00:09:49.620
<v Speaker 1>Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they emerged.</v>

175
00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.431
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's funny,</v>

176
00:09:50.431 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>but operators haven't really been the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big winners of the Internet's birth,</v>

177
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.880
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alphabet Inc,</v>

178
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:57.773
<v Speaker 1>Google's parent company as a stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market value that's quite a bit bigger </v>

179
00:09:59.820 --> 00:10:00.653
<v Speaker 1>than the combined value of the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest telecommunications operators in </v>

180
00:10:04.441 --> 00:10:09.441
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That for net neutrality to is wonder why</v>

181
00:10:09.691 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 1>change something that has worked so well</v>
<v Speaker 1>since its inception.</v>

182
00:10:12.810 --> 00:10:16.290
<v Speaker 1>When is an operator restricted access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>a means of communication?</v>

183
00:10:16.291 --> 00:10:18.710
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>g mail in facts,</v>

184
00:10:18.711 --> 00:10:19.544
<v Speaker 1>and this is what they use as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only time something similar happens </v>

185
00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.123
<v Speaker 1>was when comcast trying to block peer to</v>
<v Speaker 1>peer connections to stop illegal </v>

186
00:10:25.621 --> 00:10:26.640
<v Speaker 1>downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

187
00:10:26.700 --> 00:10:30.390
<v Speaker 1>they have to back down because of bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicity and pressure from authorities,</v>

188
00:10:31.170 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the third point here,</v>

189
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.960
<v Speaker 1>less regulation does not mean anarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

190
00:10:36.961 --> 00:10:37.794
<v Speaker 1>from now on in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet will be regulated by the </v>

191
00:10:39.841 --> 00:10:40.674
<v Speaker 1>powerful Federal Trade Commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is in charge of the antitrust </v>

192
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:44.574
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and operators will also have to comply </v>

193
00:10:46.230 --> 00:10:50.700
<v Speaker 1>with a strict transparency policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will have to communicate any policy</v>

194
00:10:50.701 --> 00:10:54.930
<v Speaker 1>that restricts or favors access speed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>any digital service.</v>

195
00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.790
<v Speaker 3>There's the sky's not going to fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>down.</v>

196
00:10:57.910 --> 00:10:58.743
<v Speaker 3>The FTC is going to be a vigorous cop on</v>
<v Speaker 3>the beat as it has been with respect to </v>

197
00:11:02.051 --> 00:11:04.300
<v Speaker 3>the Internet providers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>John Liebowitz,</v>

198
00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:06.490
<v Speaker 3>former Obama era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>FTC chairman,</v>

199
00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:07.453
<v Speaker 1>well reform advocates proposed two </v>
<v Speaker 1>examples of how the market can evolve </v>

200
00:11:10.131 --> 00:11:13.100
<v Speaker 1>without net neutrality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is the mobile phone markets,</v>

201
00:11:13.101 --> 00:11:17.270
<v Speaker 1>which is much more competitive and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>always been at the limits of legality.</v>

202
00:11:19.090 --> 00:11:19.923
<v Speaker 1>The advocates say that in this extra </v>
<v Speaker 1>users have seen reductions in their </v>

203
00:11:22.941 --> 00:11:24.920
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the services have improved.</v>

204
00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:25.783
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are promotions that include </v>

205
00:11:26.631 --> 00:11:30.320
<v Speaker 1>unlimited access to services such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netflix without data consumption,</v>

206
00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:35.350
<v Speaker 1>which clearly violates the spirits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the second example they usually give</v>

207
00:11:36.351 --> 00:11:40.610
<v Speaker 1>is curiously founds in airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly the company jet blue.</v>

208
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:41.593
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies weren't subjected to </v>

209
00:11:42.561 --> 00:11:43.394
<v Speaker 1>netsuite and you're trying to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in spite of that and having an </v>

210
00:11:45.051 --> 00:11:48.410
<v Speaker 1>agreement with Amazon's prioritize prime</v>
<v Speaker 1>video consumption on board,</v>

211
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:52.280
<v Speaker 1>they freely decided not to punish other </v>
<v Speaker 1>services such as HBO.</v>

212
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.793
<v Speaker 1>Our strategy for inflight Wifi is offer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best service at the lowest cost to </v>

213
00:11:57.281 --> 00:11:58.114
<v Speaker 1>as many passengers as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're motivated to support all </v>

214
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>content in a fair and neutral way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark Dank Berg,</v>

215
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:04.263
<v Speaker 1>chief executive of Viasat Incorporated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satellite company that provides jet </v>

216
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:08.344
<v Speaker 1>blue's internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we are facing a very complex </v>

217
00:12:16.981 --> 00:12:17.814
<v Speaker 1>question whether or not you agree with s</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you try to see both detractors and </v>

218
00:12:20.191 --> 00:12:23.040
<v Speaker 1>opponents may have exaggerated it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence just a bit,</v>

219
00:12:23.070 --> 00:12:23.903
<v Speaker 1>but I think we're facing the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>incidents and we must not forget that </v>

220
00:12:25.951 --> 00:12:27.900
<v Speaker 1>consumption tends to protect</v>

221
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:28.833
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>

222
00:12:31.990 --> 00:12:32.823
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it is true that large parts of the </v>

223
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.040
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have a serious competition?</v>

224
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:36.874
<v Speaker 1>Problem networks are only available from</v>
<v Speaker 1>one or two companies and there isn't a </v>

225
00:12:39.641 --> 00:12:42.790
<v Speaker 1>market for choosing an operator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but fortunately new technologies such as</v>

226
00:12:42.791 --> 00:12:43.624
<v Speaker 1>five g,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will make more competition </v>

227
00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:46.160
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem to be just around the</v>

228
00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:49.030
<v Speaker 2>personally.</v>

229
00:12:49.030 --> 00:12:49.863
<v Speaker 1>I'm left with one wish and that's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet remains as free as </v>

230
00:12:51.731 --> 00:12:53.350
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

231
00:12:53.380 --> 00:12:55.870
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of the end of net </v>
<v Speaker 1>neutrality?</v>
