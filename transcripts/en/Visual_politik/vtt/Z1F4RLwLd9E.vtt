1
00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.073
<v Speaker 1>European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of like the windows of </v>

2
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.073
<v Speaker 1>politics that slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't work perfectly and sometimes </v>

3
00:00:14.841 --> 00:00:18.050
<v Speaker 1>it just crashes nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us be honest.</v>

4
00:00:18.051 --> 00:00:20.150
<v Speaker 1>The other alternatives are not much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

5
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Ams consistently be more costly at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of this year.</v>

6
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:25.940
<v Speaker 1>It seems like the far right was</v>

7
00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:27.103
<v Speaker 2>stackable.</v>

8
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Some political analysts claims that </v>
<v Speaker 1>brexit would be the beginning of the end</v>

9
00:00:33.361 --> 00:00:34.194
<v Speaker 1>for the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and during this time the international </v>

10
00:00:36.511 --> 00:00:39.750
<v Speaker 1>media was full of words like frexit or </v>
<v Speaker 1>checks it out.</v>

11
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.150
<v Speaker 1>Either this year or skeptic fierro </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't a last for long.</v>

12
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.210
<v Speaker 1>Francis elected a brand new president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emmanuel Macron,</v>

13
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.630
<v Speaker 1>who stands up for the European Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>like no one else.</v>

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.430
<v Speaker 1>The same has happened in other elections</v>
<v Speaker 1>around Europe.</v>

15
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.353
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union is alive and kicking </v>

16
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.400
<v Speaker 1>at least for the next four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to do,</v>

17
00:00:59.401 --> 00:01:00.234
<v Speaker 1>hold on for just a minute because things</v>
<v Speaker 1>are more complex than what they might </v>

18
00:01:02.371 --> 00:01:03.420
<v Speaker 1>seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.420
<v Speaker 1>norms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All EU fans are the same as many of them</v>

20
00:01:06.421 --> 00:01:09.660
<v Speaker 1>don't even share the same opinion on </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the EU should be.</v>

21
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.733
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Crohn's stands for a fiscal union </v>

22
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:17.481
<v Speaker 1>with the same taxes in every country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Geneva,</v>

23
00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Angela Merkel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nausea into that.</v>

24
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>On the other hands that you formed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Belgium Prime Minister Abe Verhofstadt,</v>

25
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.540
<v Speaker 1>who is now president of the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>Liberal Party,</v>

26
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.740
<v Speaker 1>says that Europe should become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>federation like the United States.</v>

27
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:35.710
<v Speaker 1>Does everyone agree with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:35.711 --> 00:01:38.830
<v Speaker 1>the answer is rather unsurprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

29
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:39.873
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing shared by all these </v>

30
00:01:41.201 --> 00:01:44.670
<v Speaker 1>politicians is the fact that the EU is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>good thing,</v>

31
00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.190
<v Speaker 1>but now the questions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>what is the European Union all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What should it become?</v>

33
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.950
<v Speaker 1>Is it a federation or a confederation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ends?</v>

34
00:01:53.951 --> 00:01:56.650
<v Speaker 1>What are the different models on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiation table?</v>

35
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer all of </v>

36
00:01:59.321 --> 00:02:04.321
<v Speaker 1>these questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Thatcher was right.</v>

37
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.753
<v Speaker 1>Margaret township is something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Elvis Presley to euro skeptics for </v>

38
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:14.684
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This woman who was the British prime </v>

39
00:02:15.771 --> 00:02:16.604
<v Speaker 1>minister in the 19 eighties has it </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the biggest inspiration for many </v>

40
00:02:19.401 --> 00:02:22.130
<v Speaker 1>of the movements that want to end the </v>
<v Speaker 1>European project,</v>

41
00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.250
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reality is seldom simple.</v>

42
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.233
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that Margaret Thatcher was a </v>

43
00:02:30.801 --> 00:02:31.634
<v Speaker 1>big critic of political integration back</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the time the European Union still </v>

44
00:02:34.821 --> 00:02:35.654
<v Speaker 1>didn't exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was just a community of countries </v>

45
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>that traded among themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

46
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.800
<v Speaker 1>during the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different European governments agreed to</v>

47
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:43.663
<v Speaker 1>deepen this interview.</v>

48
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>Gracious is</v>

49
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.910
<v Speaker 1>when they started talking about a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>currency and you institutions.</v>

50
00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.110
<v Speaker 1>All of this culminated in 1992 with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>signing of the master x treaty,</v>

51
00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:56.003
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's it Margaret Thatcher think about </v>

52
00:02:57.481 --> 00:02:58.291
<v Speaker 1>all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:02:58.291 --> 00:02:59.124
<v Speaker 1>the truth is if we forget about </v>
<v Speaker 1>stereotypes and we actually read her </v>

54
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>memoir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find quotes like this,</v>

55
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 3>just not dream of some cozy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isolated existence on the fringes of the</v>

56
00:03:10.901 --> 00:03:14.400
<v Speaker 3>European community.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Our destiny is in Europe as part of the</v>

57
00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:18.633
<v Speaker 1>importantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that that shit was in </v>

58
00:03:19.911 --> 00:03:23.000
<v Speaker 1>total agreements with all the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

59
00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.983
<v Speaker 1>She just wanted a different model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike Lucy wanted to United States of </v>

60
00:03:27.501 --> 00:03:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Europe with the capital of Brussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she stood for a confederate.</v>

61
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:33.110
<v Speaker 2>Certainly</v>

62
00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 3>we want to see Europe more united and </v>
<v Speaker 3>with a greater sense of common purpose,</v>

63
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.460
<v Speaker 3>but it must be in a way which preserves </v>
<v Speaker 3>the different traditions,</v>

64
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.730
<v Speaker 3>parliamentary powers and sense of </v>
<v Speaker 3>national pride in one's home going,</v>

65
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.763
<v Speaker 3>we've got to explain what's the </v>
<v Speaker 3>difference between a federation and a </v>

66
00:03:52.141 --> 00:03:52.974
<v Speaker 3>confederation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>An example of a federation would be the </v>

67
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.413
<v Speaker 3>United States of America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas and California have their own </v>

68
00:04:01.501 --> 00:04:02.334
<v Speaker 3>legislatures,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their own governments and their own </v>

69
00:04:03.751 --> 00:04:04.710
<v Speaker 3>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>

70
00:04:04.711 --> 00:04:07.530
<v Speaker 3>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 3>marijuana is legal in California,</v>

71
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.600
<v Speaker 3>but illegal in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

72
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:10.493
<v Speaker 3>if the congress in Washington DC were to</v>
<v Speaker 3>pass a law legalizing cannabis across </v>

73
00:04:14.101 --> 00:04:14.934
<v Speaker 3>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any state law that would contradict the </v>

74
00:04:16.801 --> 00:04:18.430
<v Speaker 3>federal one would be automatic.</v>

75
00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:22.460
<v Speaker 1>We abolished in the confederation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>states have way more autonomy today.</v>

76
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.030
<v Speaker 1>There are actually no confederations in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

77
00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.010
<v Speaker 1>not even in Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

78
00:04:27.011 --> 00:04:27.844
<v Speaker 1>in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different kansans enjoy a loss of </v>

79
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.334
<v Speaker 1>autonomy and different taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean they are a </v>

80
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:34.180
<v Speaker 1>confederation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

81
00:04:34.181 --> 00:04:37.390
<v Speaker 1>if the parliaments of burner would pass </v>
<v Speaker 1>a law legalizing marijuana,</v>

82
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.690
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the cousins would have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>accept</v>

83
00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:40.723
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

84
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:45.443
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland was a real confederation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of the different assemblies would </v>

85
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.470
<v Speaker 1>have to have a vote to decide whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to keep cannabis legal or not.</v>

86
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:53.423
<v Speaker 1>So despite what a lot of people say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland is clearly a federation and </v>

87
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:57.990
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

88
00:04:57.991 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is a Europe then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it a federation or a confederation?</v>

89
00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course there are lots of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>stand for the federal model.</v>

90
00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:05.693
<v Speaker 1>In the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the champion of this idea has been the </v>

91
00:05:07.531 --> 00:05:12.120
<v Speaker 1>president of the Liberals Diva hotstats </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we need to be formed Europe to make</v>

92
00:05:12.121 --> 00:05:17.121
<v Speaker 1>it a real federation capable to act not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only on in the economic field,</v>

93
00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.463
<v Speaker 1>but also by establishing the defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>union by establishing a European </v>

94
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:27.120
<v Speaker 1>investigation capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to the facts today.</v>

95
00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.983
<v Speaker 1>Despite what it looks like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>national governments have a lot of </v>

96
00:05:30.571 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 1>autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

97
00:05:31.861 --> 00:05:32.910
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussels,</v>

98
00:05:32.911 --> 00:05:35.550
<v Speaker 1>past the directive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banning smoking in bars.</v>

99
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:36.503
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each of the member countries have to </v>

100
00:05:37.801 --> 00:05:40.790
<v Speaker 1>vote on their own anti tobacco law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>men's well,</v>

101
00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 1>you know what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

102
00:05:42.001 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Australia and the Czech Republic did not</v>
<v Speaker 1>pass those laws,</v>

103
00:05:45.241 --> 00:05:46.074
<v Speaker 1>and during those years you could smoke </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the cafes of Prague and Vienna Wall </v>

104
00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.380
<v Speaker 1>in Berlin and Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was completely forbidden.</v>

105
00:05:58.420 --> 00:05:59.253
<v Speaker 1>Vat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the main European tax is </v>

106
00:06:00.701 --> 00:06:03.550
<v Speaker 1>different in each country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spain they a 21 percent,</v>

107
00:06:03.551 --> 00:06:05.680
<v Speaker 1>but in hungry they paid 27 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>times.</v>

108
00:06:05.681 --> 00:06:08.860
<v Speaker 1>In Germany they've got a 19 percent tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

109
00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:09.694
<v Speaker 1>Europe is not a federation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also not a confederation </v>

110
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:15.790
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a federal confederation and</v>

111
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:16.624
<v Speaker 1>now you're probably wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this federal confederation model </v>

112
00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:22.750
<v Speaker 1>actually working or do we need to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead with some sort of United States of</v>

113
00:06:22.751 --> 00:06:23.584
<v Speaker 1>Europe</v>

114
00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.163
<v Speaker 1>wrong in the European Union?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We all have heard about the many </v>

115
00:06:29.121 --> 00:06:31.340
<v Speaker 1>mistakes this European integration has </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

116
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:35.090
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is many of these floors </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have happened in the member states</v>

117
00:06:35.091 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>individually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example.</v>

118
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.660
<v Speaker 1>Let us have a look at the refugee </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

119
00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:39.583
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true that Brussels was incapable </v>

120
00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:41.713
<v Speaker 1>of crafting a common policy to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>asylum to all the citizens that are </v>

121
00:06:44.511 --> 00:06:47.420
<v Speaker 1>running away from countries like Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq or Libya.</v>

122
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:48.313
<v Speaker 1>But let's not lie to ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same happens in every single </v>

123
00:06:51.351 --> 00:06:52.730
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Spain,</v>

124
00:06:52.731 --> 00:06:53.564
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national government did everything </v>

125
00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.060
<v Speaker 1>they could to avoid welcoming the </v>
<v Speaker 1>refugees on the other hands.</v>

126
00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.903
<v Speaker 1>Madrid city hall did the exact opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>City Hall of Madrid will make a </v>

127
00:07:05.631 --> 00:07:08.900
<v Speaker 1>welcoming project so the refugees will </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a place to live.</v>

128
00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.873
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we cannot expect to Brussels to solve </v>

129
00:07:11.601 --> 00:07:15.050
<v Speaker 1>the problems that nation states have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always had in politics.</v>

130
00:07:15.051 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>Such things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're simply not possible.</v>

131
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.960
<v Speaker 1>But do you hold on for a moment because </v>
<v Speaker 1>this does not mean the European Union is</v>

132
00:07:20.961 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>perfect either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

133
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.280
<v Speaker 1>there are many problems that are endemic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this incident.</v>

134
00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:29.493
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine you are a freelance and </v>

135
00:07:30.621 --> 00:07:33.610
<v Speaker 1>living in Hungary and you work for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>company based in Belgium.</v>

136
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.940
<v Speaker 1>Should you include Vat on the invoice </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you said to them?</v>

137
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to EU legislation,</v>

138
00:07:38.711 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't because while it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>service contract,</v>

139
00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.943
<v Speaker 1>but each country has its own tax laws </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in many cases contradicts the EU </v>

140
00:07:45.641 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But not only that,</v>

141
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.020
<v Speaker 1>what Vat should you include on that </v>
<v Speaker 1>invoice?</v>

142
00:07:50.021 --> 00:07:52.030
<v Speaker 1>The Hungarian one more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Belgium one.</v>

143
00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:52.933
<v Speaker 1>All these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could be solved if there was a common </v>

144
00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:55.894
<v Speaker 1>ground on taxation matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's many countries don't want to lose </v>

145
00:07:59.291 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty on this matter and no one </v>
<v Speaker 1>does make the first step towards.</v>

146
00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.780
<v Speaker 1>So as you might imagine from this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard for important decisions</v>

147
00:08:09.781 --> 00:08:12.210
<v Speaker 1>to move forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

148
00:08:12.270 --> 00:08:13.103
<v Speaker 1>what could be the solution to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem club with different kinds of </v>

149
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:21.630
<v Speaker 1>members?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constitution,</v>

150
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.533
<v Speaker 1>they are useful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They allow politicians and legislators </v>

151
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:27.550
<v Speaker 1>to know what they can do and what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't.</v>

152
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:28.593
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of like a minimal agreements </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way a government knows what it can </v>

153
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:35.320
<v Speaker 1>pass as a law and it's a system that has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been proven effective</v>

154
00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:38.520
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

155
00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:39.480
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem?</v>

156
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:40.493
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old attempts to release a European </v>

157
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:42.504
<v Speaker 1>constitution have failed in 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both France and the Netherlands had </v>

158
00:08:45.901 --> 00:08:46.734
<v Speaker 1>referendums where they rejected the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proposal for a European magna Carta </v>

159
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:52.020
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussels politicians,</v>

160
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.390
<v Speaker 1>matt again to write a new version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this constitution,</v>

161
00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.253
<v Speaker 1>these so called Lisbon Treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a milder version of the </v>

162
00:08:58.081 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 1>previously drafted constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's integration problems persisted,</v>

163
00:09:02.430 --> 00:09:03.263
<v Speaker 1>but truth is that each country has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own interests and it's hard to get them </v>

164
00:09:06.211 --> 00:09:07.044
<v Speaker 1>all on the same page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why not just recognize the </v>

165
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:10.254
<v Speaker 1>differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why the European Commission </v>

166
00:09:12.271 --> 00:09:13.104
<v Speaker 1>has made the European Whitesburg where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they imagined by you've potential </v>

167
00:09:16.141 --> 00:09:16.974
<v Speaker 1>scenarios for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them would allow each state to </v>

168
00:09:22.741 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 1>have a different level of integration.</v>

169
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.000
<v Speaker 3>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>at the beginning of 2017,</v>

170
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:27.863
<v Speaker 3>the economist proposed to create a </v>
<v Speaker 3>European Union with different kinds of </v>

171
00:09:31.351 --> 00:09:32.184
<v Speaker 3>memberships of one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there would be a premium member who </v>

172
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.574
<v Speaker 3>would share a common currency,</v>
<v Speaker 3>common fiscal policy and a common </v>

173
00:09:38.281 --> 00:09:39.840
<v Speaker 3>foreign policy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On another one,</v>

174
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.733
<v Speaker 3>there would be a silver member would </v>
<v Speaker 3>just share a common market and the free </v>

175
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:44.550
<v Speaker 3>movement area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Other members,</v>

176
00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:47.750
<v Speaker 3>let's call them the bronze category,</v>
<v Speaker 3>would have access to just the comment</v>

177
00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:48.603
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

178
00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:52.190
<v Speaker 3>This way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be way easier to convince every</v>

179
00:09:52.191 --> 00:09:54.530
<v Speaker 3>country to pass a European constitution.</v>

180
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.180
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea of a United States of Europe,</v>

181
00:09:57.181 --> 00:09:58.014
<v Speaker 1>it's lost a lot of support supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of a Europe with different </v>

182
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>membership levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

183
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:06.000
<v Speaker 1>currently enjoys a lot of stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

184
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:06.863
<v Speaker 1>Francis brand new president is willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to play a major role in the future of </v>

185
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does he really stands for?</v>

186
00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:13.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not answering that in this video,</v>

187
00:10:13.801 --> 00:10:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but if you'd like to know more about </v>

<v Speaker 1>do you think this hybrid of a federal </v>

190
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:28.070
<v Speaker 1>confederation with different men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but categories can actually work?</v>

191
00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.053
<v Speaker 1>Or should we keep trying?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For a federation where everyone has the </v>

192
00:10:31.251 --> 00:10:32.084
<v Speaker 1>same rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please do let us know what you think in </v>
