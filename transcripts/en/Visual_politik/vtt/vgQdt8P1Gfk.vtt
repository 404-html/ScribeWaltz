<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:08.623
<v Speaker 2>the alliance between the United States </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the European countries is not </v>

3
00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:14.630
<v Speaker 2>exactly having its best moments right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

4
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.523
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump has made quite an inference</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as jeopardize the relationship of </v>

5
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:22.340
<v Speaker 2>these nations who an extent that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could even possibly break up.</v>

6
00:00:22.341 --> 00:00:24.800
<v Speaker 2>We have seen that with the Paris </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement,</v>

7
00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:25.753
<v Speaker 2>make our planet great the game and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Donald Trump's position towards </v>

8
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:31.934
<v Speaker 2>NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most powerful military organization </v>

9
00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 2>in history and I never asked watch what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the new NATO headquarters cost.</v>

10
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:43.543
<v Speaker 2>I refuse to do that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this video we're going to focus on </v>

11
00:00:46.041 --> 00:00:46.874
<v Speaker 2>this organization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look at what's happening </v>

12
00:00:48.621 --> 00:00:51.230
<v Speaker 2>with Neato,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why Donald Trump is criticizing.</v>

13
00:00:51.231 --> 00:00:54.740
<v Speaker 2>It's so much and what the future is for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this organization,</v>

14
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.460
<v Speaker 2>but before we get into any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get some perspective.</v>

15
00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:01.903
<v Speaker 1>NATO,</v>

16
00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.823
<v Speaker 2>I'll look back</v>

17
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:10.240
<v Speaker 2>shortly after the ends of World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,</v>

18
00:01:10.241 --> 00:01:11.074
<v Speaker 2>it took its first steps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was born in 1949 with a very clear </v>

19
00:01:14.381 --> 00:01:15.580
<v Speaker 2>mission,</v>
<v Speaker 2>restrain,</v>

20
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.170
<v Speaker 2>stop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if needed,</v>

21
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.033
<v Speaker 2>defeat the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Cold War had just started and there </v>

22
00:01:20.681 --> 00:01:21.514
<v Speaker 2>was an atmosphere of tension.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Berlin blockade is already taking </v>

23
00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:27.710
<v Speaker 2>place in the Czech Communist Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had completely taking control with acute</v>

24
00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:29.290
<v Speaker 2>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that time,</v>

25
00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.290
<v Speaker 2>nobody knew what was going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Ans,</v>

26
00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.060
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of war was very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very real.</v>

27
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.310
<v Speaker 2>So let's take a look at the historical </v>
<v Speaker 2>context.</v>

28
00:01:36.311 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 2>The world had just gone through World </v>
<v Speaker 2>War Two.</v>

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.360
<v Speaker 2>Europe was destroyed and there was an </v>
<v Speaker 2>absolute distrust on both sides.</v>

30
00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:44.223
<v Speaker 2>The truth is the door wouldn't have been</v>
<v Speaker 2>a surprise and that was the situation </v>

31
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:48.970
<v Speaker 2>which existed when NATO was born.</v>

32
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning,</v>

33
00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.320
<v Speaker 3>NATO was formed by the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

34
00:01:53.321 --> 00:01:55.600
<v Speaker 3>and 10 European countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>France,</v>

35
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.920
<v Speaker 3>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the United Kingdom,</v>

36
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.210
<v Speaker 3>Belgium,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Netherlands,</v>

37
00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Denmark,</v>

38
00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iceland,</v>

39
00:02:00.491 --> 00:02:02.140
<v Speaker 3>and portrait.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A few years later,</v>

40
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.400
<v Speaker 3>the federal public of Germany or western</v>
<v Speaker 3>Germany was added to that.</v>

41
00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:09.090
<v Speaker 2>The general purpose of the idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bit spirits,</v>

42
00:02:09.091 --> 00:02:11.370
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was to bring it forces together.</v>

43
00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:12.720
<v Speaker 2>If a man become,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she was attacked.</v>

44
00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:15.660
<v Speaker 2>It was seen as if all the members had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been attacked as well.</v>

45
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.730
<v Speaker 2>Over 101 for all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

46
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

47
00:02:19.021 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 2>but also not quite because there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite and lots of small prints.</v>

48
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.690
<v Speaker 3>NATO after the colon.</v>

49
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.450
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that all changed in 1991 the fall of the</v>

50
00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.840
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union left Neato with no clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>Parvis without an enemy.</v>

51
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.830
<v Speaker 2>What is the point of the alliance?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a question many people asked and</v>

52
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:45.693
<v Speaker 2>many still do today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wait one second because against all </v>

53
00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:49.834
<v Speaker 2>odds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was actually after the fall of the </v>

54
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union that the organization </v>
<v Speaker 2>started to play a more active role.</v>

55
00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.570
<v Speaker 1>It is</v>

56
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.970
<v Speaker 3>take an action quite frequently since </v>
<v Speaker 3>then.</v>

57
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.250
<v Speaker 3>It's includes Serbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kosovo,</v>

58
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.720
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Libya,</v>

59
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:07.653
<v Speaker 3>control over the Baltic Sea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It gets piracy and the Indian Ocean and </v>

60
00:03:10.051 --> 00:03:12.690
<v Speaker 3>recently support for the fight against </v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis</v>

61
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.463
<v Speaker 2>was also during this time when more new </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that signed up since it </v>

62
00:03:17.681 --> 00:03:19.570
<v Speaker 2>started in corporations have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>regular,</v>

63
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 2>but since 1991 in corporations have </v>
<v Speaker 2>really sped up.</v>

64
00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:25.340
<v Speaker 1>1949</v>

65
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:26.173
<v Speaker 3>there were 12 countries in NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Today there are 28 many of these </v>

66
00:03:29.301 --> 00:03:32.300
<v Speaker 3>countries are from the old Warsaw Pact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a similar thing to NATO,</v>

67
00:03:32.301 --> 00:03:33.370
<v Speaker 3>but led by the Soviets</v>

68
00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.720
<v Speaker 2>hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin's Russia has never liked that.</v>

69
00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:45.500
<v Speaker 2>In fact of the award of 2008 between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and Georgia took place,</v>

70
00:03:45.501 --> 00:03:46.334
<v Speaker 2>partly because Georgia wanted to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>a member of NATO and something similar </v>

71
00:03:50.451 --> 00:03:51.284
<v Speaker 2>has happened in the Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ends after the recent crisis in Ukraine </v>

72
00:03:54.441 --> 00:03:58.400
<v Speaker 2>and the clash between them and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>NATO seems to have sped up again.</v>

73
00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

74
00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 2>also in 2016 and immediate action force </v>
<v Speaker 2>was set up.</v>

75
00:04:14.221 --> 00:04:15.054
<v Speaker 2>This is made of 5,000 soldiers capable </v>
<v Speaker 2>of deploying very quickly and in almost </v>

76
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:19.703
<v Speaker 2>any place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The socal audit spearhead force has </v>

77
00:04:23.301 --> 00:04:28.301
<v Speaker 2>5,000 soldiers that are part of a larger</v>
<v Speaker 2>rapid action force of 40,000 soldiers.</v>

78
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:29.413
<v Speaker 2>In order to coordinate it's deployments </v>
<v Speaker 2>via alliance has created since </v>

79
00:04:31.941 --> 00:04:32.774
<v Speaker 2>September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2014 eight support headquarters in all </v>

80
00:04:35.511 --> 00:04:38.360
<v Speaker 2>the countries that used to be under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet influence.</v>

81
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:40.673
<v Speaker 2>And then 2017 the United States made the</v>
<v Speaker 2>largest troop deployments in Europe </v>

82
00:04:44.841 --> 00:04:47.390
<v Speaker 2>since the Cold War following a NATO </v>
<v Speaker 2>mission.</v>

83
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.853
<v Speaker 3>Thousands of US troops arrive in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 3>in one of the largest deployments since </v>

84
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:53.450
<v Speaker 3>the cold</v>

85
00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:54.283
<v Speaker 2>or we all talking about more than 4,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>soldiers and hundreds of tanks and </v>

86
00:04:58.611 --> 00:04:59.444
<v Speaker 2>armored vehicles already being deployed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in eastern Europe on a mission that </v>

87
00:05:02.691 --> 00:05:03.524
<v Speaker 2>reminds us of the initial mission of </v>
<v Speaker 2>NATO to discourage Russia from any </v>

88
00:05:06.651 --> 00:05:08.720
<v Speaker 2>expansionist temptations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

89
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:09.583
<v Speaker 2>despite all of this activity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the role of NATO is still uncertain and </v>

90
00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 2>the United States is still unhappy with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the commitments from the organizations.</v>

91
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:19.430
<v Speaker 2>European partners.</v>

92
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:20.363
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

93
00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 3>The anger of the United States.</v>

94
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 2>I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>

95
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.383
<v Speaker 2>the Rom the mutual defense guarantee you</v>
<v Speaker 2>if a member of NATO is a tax is not as </v>

96
00:05:32.181 --> 00:05:35.270
<v Speaker 2>clear as it seems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take a look at article five the one that</v>

97
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:38.370
<v Speaker 2>regulates this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parties</v>

98
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:39.203
<v Speaker 3>agree that an armed attack against one </v>
<v Speaker 3>or more of them shall be considered it </v>

99
00:05:42.261 --> 00:05:46.170
<v Speaker 3>an attack against them all.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And consequently they agree that if such</v>

100
00:05:46.171 --> 00:05:47.004
<v Speaker 3>an attack occurs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>each of them will assist the party or </v>

101
00:05:49.081 --> 00:05:49.914
<v Speaker 3>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So attacked by taking forth with such </v>

102
00:05:52.471 --> 00:05:56.730
<v Speaker 3>actions as it deems necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including the use of armed force article</v>

103
00:05:56.731 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 3>five of the North Atlantic Treaty,</v>

104
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.803
<v Speaker 2>including the use of armed forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means the Tipi country were to </v>

105
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.364
<v Speaker 2>suffer an attack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean the rest have to give </v>

106
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.213
<v Speaker 2>immediate military support and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>why all of the presidents of the United </v>

107
00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:11.713
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since Harry Truman have taken advantage </v>

108
00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.203
<v Speaker 2>of the first NATO meeting they attended </v>
<v Speaker 2>to in article five as a commitment of </v>

109
00:06:18.441 --> 00:06:19.490
<v Speaker 2>military force.</v>

110
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:21.833
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

111
00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.113
<v Speaker 2>How are the Donald Trump hasn't,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was expected to do so during the </v>

112
00:06:27.851 --> 00:06:32.140
<v Speaker 2>inauguration of a monument for victims </v>
<v Speaker 2>of nine 11 in Brussels where he attended</v>

113
00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:33.890
<v Speaker 2>his first meeting meeting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

114
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 2>he was asked to do so by the European </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

115
00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>The White House have said that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would,</v>

116
00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:41.290
<v Speaker 2>but a final commitment was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>forthcoming.</v>

117
00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:42.153
<v Speaker 2>There are analysts that think this is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>major issue and they refer to this as </v>

118
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:48.070
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all time.</v>

119
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.110
<v Speaker 2>Other analysts don't think this is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>important,</v>

120
00:06:50.111 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 2>but what is undeniable is that this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>not been well received in Europe,</v>

121
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:56.220
<v Speaker 2>especially for these reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

122
00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:57.400
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

123
00:06:57.400 --> 00:06:58.233
<v Speaker 3>Till now,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only country which is invoked </v>

124
00:06:59.301 --> 00:07:00.134
<v Speaker 3>article five was the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They did it after nine 11 and they </v>

125
00:07:02.841 --> 00:07:05.270
<v Speaker 3>received immediate support from all </v>
<v Speaker 3>members of NATO.</v>

126
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:07.123
<v Speaker 2>Well thing is that trump didn't want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer support and actually he took </v>

128
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 2>advantage of his speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you recrimination the alleged lack of</v>

129
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:15.160
<v Speaker 2>commitments by his European allies?</v>

130
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>He</v>

131
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:17.363
<v Speaker 3>Europeans what?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Dedicating a monument to remember the </v>

132
00:07:18.891 --> 00:07:19.724
<v Speaker 3>888 European,</v>
<v Speaker 3>158 Canadian and 2,396 American troops </v>

133
00:07:24.201 --> 00:07:26.870
<v Speaker 3>who died in Afghanistan took some doing </v>
<v Speaker 3>Thomas,</v>

134
00:07:26.871 --> 00:07:27.704
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

135
00:07:28.210 --> 00:07:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's,</v>

136
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.340
<v Speaker 2>trump is not the only one angry about </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

137
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 2>Bama.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He had the same opinion.</v>

138
00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:33.973
<v Speaker 2>And the question is now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why is the United States so angry at </v>

139
00:07:36.891 --> 00:07:37.724
<v Speaker 2>NATO?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well basically because they claim that </v>

140
00:07:39.501 --> 00:07:43.560
<v Speaker 2>the European members of NATO on not </v>
<v Speaker 2>committed enough or don't spend enough</v>

141
00:07:43.770 --> 00:07:44.603
<v Speaker 1>money</v>

142
00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:49.863
<v Speaker 3>rule.</v>
<v Speaker 3>All NATO members are committed to </v>

143
00:07:51.071 --> 00:07:54.670
<v Speaker 3>spending at least 2% of their GDP on </v>
<v Speaker 3>defense.</v>

144
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.533
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only a few countries and meeting this </v>

145
00:07:57.071 --> 00:07:58.840
<v Speaker 3>commitment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these include the United Kingdom,</v>

146
00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:00.490
<v Speaker 3>Poland,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sonia Greece,</v>

147
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:01.420
<v Speaker 3>and of course the united,</v>

148
00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:04.153
<v Speaker 2>the rest welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite some way from spending that </v>

149
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:07.063
<v Speaker 2>amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just taking a look at what trump's </v>

150
00:08:07.871 --> 00:08:08.704
<v Speaker 2>secretary of defense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>James Mattis has to say about the </v>

151
00:08:10.821 --> 00:08:12.080
<v Speaker 2>European countries.</v>

152
00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 3>Americans cannot care more for your </v>
<v Speaker 3>children's future security than you do.</v>

153
00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:18.183
<v Speaker 2>Now wait a second,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it does this mean that the </v>

154
00:08:19.721 --> 00:08:22.630
<v Speaker 2>European countries don't spend money on </v>
<v Speaker 2>defense?</v>

155
00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:24.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's certainly not the case.</v>

156
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:25.773
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we add up all of the budgets of all </v>

157
00:08:27.371 --> 00:08:29.440
<v Speaker 2>European countries that are members of </v>
<v Speaker 2>NATO,</v>

158
00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:33.370
<v Speaker 2>these countries spend $250 billion every</v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

159
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.233
<v Speaker 2>So you're with these countries were one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be the country with the second </v>

160
00:08:37.271 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 2>highest military spending after only the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

161
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.763
<v Speaker 2>So if it's money we're talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not that spending has been reduced </v>

162
00:08:44.411 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 2>or at least not relative to the threats </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the world is currently facing times.</v>

163
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:49.383
<v Speaker 2>They're pretty different sands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't live with a Soviet Union </v>

164
00:08:51.821 --> 00:08:52.654
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

165
00:08:56.670 --> 00:08:58.710
<v Speaker 1>and obsession of the United States,</v>

166
00:09:00.400 --> 00:09:01.233
<v Speaker 2>let us say it loud and clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world has changed and we are facing </v>

167
00:09:05.171 --> 00:09:06.004
<v Speaker 2>different difficulties than we were ever</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 1960s the risk today is not just </v>

168
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:10.263
<v Speaker 2>the possibility of a great war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This risk has been reduced by </v>

169
00:09:12.791 --> 00:09:16.270
<v Speaker 2>globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade and mutually assured destruction.</v>

170
00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:19.360
<v Speaker 2>The threats we face today can be found </v>
<v Speaker 2>in terrorism,</v>

171
00:09:19.390 --> 00:09:21.050
<v Speaker 2>piracy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cyber warfare,</v>

172
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.890
<v Speaker 2>am's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the risk of the proliferation of weapons</v>

173
00:09:23.891 --> 00:09:26.950
<v Speaker 2>of mass destruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So must we fight these risks?</v>

174
00:09:27.010 --> 00:09:27.843
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>certainly this is something that we </v>

175
00:09:29.591 --> 00:09:30.424
<v Speaker 2>won't accomplish with more tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We also need to consider that we are </v>

176
00:09:33.471 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 2>dealing with a very different kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>water date,</v>

177
00:09:36.250 --> 00:09:37.083
<v Speaker 2>something known as hybrid warfare where </v>
<v Speaker 2>combat isn't like what it was in older </v>

178
00:09:40.891 --> 00:09:44.920
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the wars are more and more often</v>

179
00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:48.450
<v Speaker 2>about gorillas and as groups aimed at </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilizing nations.</v>

180
00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:51.520
<v Speaker 2>Other that is political pressure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economic penalties,</v>

181
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:53.200
<v Speaker 2>cyber warfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>interference.</v>

182
00:09:53.201 --> 00:09:55.150
<v Speaker 2>In the election processes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence,</v>

183
00:09:55.151 --> 00:09:56.500
<v Speaker 2>operations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

184
00:09:56.560 --> 00:09:59.050
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that make wall much more company.</v>

185
00:09:59.090 --> 00:10:04.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the mistakes of Europe,</v>

186
00:10:06.370 --> 00:10:10.240
<v Speaker 2>one thing is clear,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they see numbers on not doing everything</v>

187
00:10:10.241 --> 00:10:11.074
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand is the organization has </v>

188
00:10:12.491 --> 00:10:13.324
<v Speaker 2>established a more sensible conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>20% of the budget should be spent on </v>

189
00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:18.880
<v Speaker 2>equipment here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even European countries,</v>

190
00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:19.714
<v Speaker 2>which spends more on soldiers than they </v>
<v Speaker 2>need still arms meeting this </v>

191
00:10:22.931 --> 00:10:25.660
<v Speaker 2>requirements on the other hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>European countries,</v>

192
00:10:25.661 --> 00:10:28.990
<v Speaker 2>I'll still quite disorganized and use </v>
<v Speaker 2>very different systems,</v>

193
00:10:29.020 --> 00:10:33.880
<v Speaker 2>which makes production maintenance and </v>
<v Speaker 2>deployments more ends more expensive.</v>

194
00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:35.850
<v Speaker 2>Just have a look at what happens with </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech.</v>

195
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:39.640
<v Speaker 3>The United States primarily uses one </v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of tank,</v>

196
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:40.563
<v Speaker 3>the Abrams tank,</v>
<v Speaker 3>while the Europeans use it to 19 </v>

197
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:43.774
<v Speaker 3>different models.</v>

198
00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:48.190
<v Speaker 2>Imagine the chaos when he joined </v>
<v Speaker 2>deployments.</v>

199
00:10:48.191 --> 00:10:49.024
<v Speaker 2>It has to be organized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can't even share the same </v>

200
00:10:50.891 --> 00:10:51.724
<v Speaker 2>replacement equipments and as well the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same is true for much more than just </v>

201
00:10:55.001 --> 00:10:57.130
<v Speaker 2>tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so the final question is,</v>

202
00:10:57.131 --> 00:11:00.670
<v Speaker 2>can it may say play a significant role </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the future?</v>

203
00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.470
<v Speaker 2>In our opinion here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a visual politic,</v>

204
00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.090
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely can,</v>

205
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:07.660
<v Speaker 2>but only after a bit of a perspective </v>
<v Speaker 2>shift.</v>

206
00:11:07.690 --> 00:11:08.523
<v Speaker 2>We feel that countries can spend money </v>
<v Speaker 2>better and actually share resources </v>

207
00:11:11.411 --> 00:11:12.244
<v Speaker 2>rather than just spending more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though that might upset some </v>

208
00:11:14.961 --> 00:11:18.580
<v Speaker 2>military contractors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now we'd like to know your opinion.</v>

209
00:11:18.581 --> 00:11:20.920
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what should the future of NATO beat?</v>

210
00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the European countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>that should meet to the U S is demands?</v>

211
00:11:24.610 --> 00:11:25.443
<v Speaker 2>Or do you think a NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should focus less on conventional </v>

212
00:11:27.521 --> 00:11:28.870
<v Speaker 2>warfare?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or maybe you think,</v>

213
00:11:28.871 --> 00:11:30.370
<v Speaker 2>Nita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you should just dissolve.</v>

214

<v Speaker 2>Let us know what you think in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>comments below.</v>
