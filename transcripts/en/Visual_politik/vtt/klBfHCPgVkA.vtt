1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.923
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before we get started with today's </v>

3
00:00:09.561 --> 00:00:11.480
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've got to give you two warnings.</v>

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:12.314
<v Speaker 2>The first is that we might include some </v>
<v Speaker 2>spoilers about narcos on via sleep or </v>

5
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.720
<v Speaker 2>given that it's a TV show based on real </v>
<v Speaker 2>history,</v>

6
00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:18.703
<v Speaker 2>I don't think this is so much of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem and the second warning is that </v>

7
00:00:21.081 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 2>today we're going to talk about drug </v>
<v Speaker 2>trafficking,</v>

8
00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.193
<v Speaker 2>a topic where the information we have is</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty incomplete and all the time </v>

9
00:00:27.051 --> 00:00:27.884
<v Speaker 2>police to finding new bits of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information that could prove parts of </v>

10
00:00:29.901 --> 00:00:30.920
<v Speaker 2>this video wrong.</v>

11
00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.810
<v Speaker 2>Tell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That being said,</v>

12
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 2>let's move on to Colombia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The country that is known of the country</v>

13
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:42.990
<v Speaker 2>of a thousand rhythms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country of coffee and the birthplace</v>

14
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.550
<v Speaker 2>of so many of those Latino singers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>got the whole world to dance.</v>

15
00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.413
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what really made this country famous is </v>

16
00:00:49.521 --> 00:00:54.521
<v Speaker 2>sadly this man [inaudible] video </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] the king of cocaine,</v>

17
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:01.010
<v Speaker 2>the man who basically created one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>world's most dangerous industries at the</v>

18
00:01:01.011 --> 00:01:03.840
<v Speaker 2>ends of the 1980s Pablo Escobar or El </v>
<v Speaker 2>Patron,</v>

19
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 2>as his neighbors used to know him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled it,</v>

20
00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:09.380
<v Speaker 2>and 90% of the worldwide production of </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine.</v>

21
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.310
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly it met a Yin and a city of 2 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million inhabitants became the Hollywood</v>

22
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.720
<v Speaker 2>of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

23
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 2>on December the first 1993 he died </v>
<v Speaker 2>during a shootout with the police.</v>

24
00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.590
<v Speaker 2>But well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've probably already knew that.</v>

25
00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.700
<v Speaker 2>So the question now becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

26
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.170
<v Speaker 2>what happens after Pablo who took his </v>
<v Speaker 2>business?</v>

27
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.510
<v Speaker 2>Ma'Ams then there is the most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>question of all,</v>

28
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:30.493
<v Speaker 2>and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is there still cocaine trafficking in </v>

29
00:01:32.691 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 2>Columbia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

30
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.900
<v Speaker 2>today we're certainly going to answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those questions,</v>

31
00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 2>but before we get into any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's talk a little bit about cocaine.</v>

32
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.733
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

33
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.490
<v Speaker 2>weed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cocaine is the second most consumed drug</v>

34
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:50.353
<v Speaker 2>in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's unlike the first one that </v>

35
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.470
<v Speaker 2>cocaine is extremely hard to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>

36
00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.333
<v Speaker 2>It groves anywhere on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in cold places like North America </v>

37
00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.143
<v Speaker 2>grow houses are found all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And with just a little bit of </v>

38
00:02:01.881 --> 00:02:02.714
<v Speaker 2>expenditure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone can create at home the optimal </v>

39
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:08.240
<v Speaker 2>conditions for growing cannabis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's coca leaves.</v>

40
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 2>They are a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You need a very specific habitat to grow</v>

41
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.064
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why only some countries can </v>

42
00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 2>grow these leaves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the main countries are Colombia.</v>

43
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.740
<v Speaker 2>Peru and Bolivia ship.</v>

44
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

45
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

46
00:02:26.921 --> 00:02:29.830
<v Speaker 2>there is just space for a few suppliers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hand,</v>

47
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:32.680
<v Speaker 2>the demand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it won't stop growing as well.</v>

48
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.543
<v Speaker 2>It's a gullible demands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why it cocaine is such a high </v>

49
00:02:36.131 --> 00:02:36.964
<v Speaker 2>profit business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is why right after Pablo </v>

50
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.413
<v Speaker 2>Escobar's death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were lots of people willing to </v>

51
00:02:41.741 --> 00:02:42.850
<v Speaker 2>take his place.</v>

52
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.620
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] feel</v>

53
00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.000
<v Speaker 2>bores.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

54
00:02:48.001 --> 00:02:50.700
<v Speaker 2>probably West Guevara was the leader of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the median cartel,</v>

55
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:51.583
<v Speaker 2>but even before his death,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was already a second cocaine </v>

56
00:02:54.061 --> 00:02:56.400
<v Speaker 2>capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that was the city of Cali,</v>

57
00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 2>also in Columbia and with a very similar</v>
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

58
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.330
<v Speaker 3>We're Pablo left a trail of bodies and </v>
<v Speaker 3>chaos.</v>

59
00:03:02.331 --> 00:03:03.164
<v Speaker 3>Since week Kelly May problems disappear </v>
<v Speaker 3>with an army of lawyers and a mountain </v>

60
00:03:06.411 --> 00:03:08.990
<v Speaker 3>of legal briefs.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Met Him.</v>

61
00:03:08.991 --> 00:03:11.300
<v Speaker 3>Cartel was Miami,</v>
<v Speaker 3>swimming pools,</v>

62
00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.750
<v Speaker 3>bikini girls.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taki is a two tone cadillac.</v>

63
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.590
<v Speaker 3>The Cali cartel was New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>elegant,</v>

64
00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:20.120
<v Speaker 3>smooth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>subtle,</v>

65
00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.883
<v Speaker 3>where they can fuel the 24 hour night,</v>
<v Speaker 3>live with cocaine and still make sure </v>

66
00:03:24.951 --> 00:03:26.690
<v Speaker 3>everybody showed up for work on Wall </v>
<v Speaker 3>Street.</v>

67
00:03:26.691 --> 00:03:27.524
<v Speaker 3>The next morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the first met Ian and Kelly works side </v>

68
00:03:31.071 --> 00:03:35.150
<v Speaker 3>by side,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in Colombia when money's involved,</v>

69
00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.740
<v Speaker 3>blood inevitably flows.</v>

70
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.003
<v Speaker 2>The Cali cartel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they wanted to take the whole of </v>

71
00:03:40.451 --> 00:03:41.284
<v Speaker 2>Escobar's business that many in plenty </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Narcos who wants to do the same </v>

72
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:47.470
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them with Diego Fernandez,</v>

73
00:03:47.471 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Marillo Aka dawn.</v>

74
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:50.143
<v Speaker 1>Bye now.</v>

75
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.943
<v Speaker 2>It helps the police deal with Pablo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Escobar and made an alliance with the </v>

76
00:03:57.351 --> 00:03:58.184
<v Speaker 2>Cali cartel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'd even had close ties with a right </v>

77
00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 2>wing paramilitary group called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombian self defense forces with Pablo</v>

78
00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.863
<v Speaker 2>Escobar dead and buried.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don dunner started a new organization </v>

79
00:04:07.731 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 2>with this paramilitary group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called office center,</v>

80
00:04:10.331 --> 00:04:12.140
<v Speaker 2>Dan Vergano.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>

81
00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:15.780
<v Speaker 2>smaller narcos in metagene.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're also fighting for their share.</v>

82
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.250
<v Speaker 2>The street you see on the screen was the</v>
<v Speaker 2>border between one band.</v>

83
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.113
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

84
00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.360
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

85
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.350
<v Speaker 2>if you were a worker for the ovc now the</v>
<v Speaker 2>end de Gallo and cross the street,</v>

86
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.303
<v Speaker 2>someone would kill you immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you can imagine that these were </v>

87
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 2>extremely violent times for the city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different drug bands,</v>

88
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:37.920
<v Speaker 2>or killing each other pretty much all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the time.</v>

89
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.830
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cali cartel was way more subtle.</v>

90
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:43.470
<v Speaker 2>This is Gilberto Rodriguez and his </v>
<v Speaker 2>partner,</v>

91
00:04:43.471 --> 00:04:44.304
<v Speaker 2>Pasho Herrera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were high class buyers with plenty </v>

92
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:48.720
<v Speaker 2>of contact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some on politicians and judges.</v>

93
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.673
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gilberto Rodriguez paid over $6 million </v>

94
00:04:51.841 --> 00:04:52.674
<v Speaker 2>to finance the campaign of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombian presidents anesto Santa's </v>

95
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.083
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite beautifully when it's in the </v>

96
00:04:57.871 --> 00:05:00.750
<v Speaker 2>corruption after sometime the inevitable</v>
<v Speaker 2>happens.</v>

97
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:01.411
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sonia,</v>

98
00:05:01.411 --> 00:05:02.244
<v Speaker 2>I'll go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are not.</v>

99
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:04.673
<v Speaker 2>Government has started the extradition </v>
<v Speaker 2>process for the chief of the Cali </v>

100
00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.800
<v Speaker 2>cartel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

101
00:05:10.801 --> 00:05:11.634
<v Speaker 2>dawn burner volunteers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was at a totally different story </v>

102
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.920
<v Speaker 2>among all the characters that appear on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Narcos TV show.</v>

103
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 2>Dawn burner is the one who has lost the </v>
<v Speaker 2>longest without being put behind bars,</v>

104
00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:22.613
<v Speaker 2>but we're just a minute because now we </v>
<v Speaker 2>can talk about in the characters that </v>

105
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:26.940
<v Speaker 2>didn't appear on the show at least in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first two seasons,</v>

106
00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:28.890
<v Speaker 2>and to prepare yourself because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

107
00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:29.970
<v Speaker 2>there's a lot to tell.</v>

108
00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.830
<v Speaker 2>Remember how don burner was working with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this right wing group?</v>

109
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:33.683
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political ideology was more </v>

110
00:05:34.831 --> 00:05:36.810
<v Speaker 2>important than what you might think for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this group.</v>

111
00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:37.673
<v Speaker 2>The Colombian self defense forces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were born to fight against </v>

112
00:05:40.771 --> 00:05:42.600
<v Speaker 2>communist guerrillas in the country.</v>

113
00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.970
<v Speaker 1>Collusionary</v>

114
00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 2>armed forces of Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fark Fark.</v>

115
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.030
<v Speaker 2>It's more than just a simple terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

116
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.983
<v Speaker 2>In some areas of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they became a parallel government more </v>

117
00:05:55.931 --> 00:05:56.764
<v Speaker 2>than an Alpha eater kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They could be better comparison with </v>

118
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 2>dash or Islamic state.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even today,</v>

119
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.454
<v Speaker 2>a good parts of the Colombian rainforest</v>
<v Speaker 2>is under the control of this Marxist </v>

120
00:06:03.951 --> 00:06:05.240
<v Speaker 2>Leninist group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fox,</v>

121
00:06:05.241 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>they had their own doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their own hospitals,</v>

122
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 2>and of course they collected their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>

123
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:11.983
<v Speaker 2>This group has over 20,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>members spread across 24 of Columbia's </v>

124
00:06:16.371 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 2>32 provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

125
00:06:19.161 --> 00:06:19.994
<v Speaker 2>Fox,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were not good friends of drug </v>

126
00:06:21.081 --> 00:06:22.160
<v Speaker 2>trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

127
00:06:22.161 --> 00:06:24.710
<v Speaker 2>drug traffic isn't terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They do have common enemies,</v>

128
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.603
<v Speaker 2>but the idea of becoming a millionaire </v>
<v Speaker 2>by selling a product on the </v>

129
00:06:27.591 --> 00:06:30.740
<v Speaker 2>international market doesn't sound very </v>
<v Speaker 2>Marxist.</v>

130
00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.190
<v Speaker 2>Besides extortion and kidnapping,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were pretty lucrative businesses as</v>

131
00:06:34.191 --> 00:06:37.040
<v Speaker 2>well as FARC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were experts on these matters.</v>

132
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:39.470
<v Speaker 2>Add to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the fact that don burner and this office</v>

133
00:06:39.471 --> 00:06:42.830
<v Speaker 2>seen to and vanguard who had an </v>
<v Speaker 2>anticommunist group on their site,</v>

134
00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 2>and you can imagine that the war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was about to happen,</v>

135
00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 2>but with this</v>

136
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:50.420
<v Speaker 4>is the boy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Huh?</v>

137
00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:52.560
<v Speaker 4>Municipality.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I data today,</v>

138
00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 4>it's covered by plants and trees.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That is the north,</v>

139
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.640
<v Speaker 4>apart from where bark launched rockets </v>
<v Speaker 4>to the other part of the municipality,</v>

140
00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business is business and the mass of the</v>

141
00:07:01.901 --> 00:07:02.734
<v Speaker 2>money for could make with kidnapping.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was hard to resist the temptation of </v>

142
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:08.800
<v Speaker 2>drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So one day Mudita [inaudible] has one of</v>

143
00:07:08.801 --> 00:07:12.340
<v Speaker 2>the main thought leaders decided to try </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the cocaine business.</v>

144
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:13.493
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

145
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:17.383
<v Speaker 4>Jean Front of the FARC went from 200 </v>
<v Speaker 4>members to over 800 due to cocaine </v>

146
00:07:21.891 --> 00:07:24.510
<v Speaker 4>revenue,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which became one of the primary ways the</v>

147
00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 4>Koreas finance their activities.</v>

148
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:30.720
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget the FARC have the control </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all the areas where coca plantations,</v>

149
00:07:30.721 --> 00:07:33.450
<v Speaker 2>where in fact they had already extorted </v>
<v Speaker 2>the growers.</v>

150
00:07:33.510 --> 00:07:35.750
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless with Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caracas is leader.</v>

151
00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.170
<v Speaker 2>FARC have created their own fields and </v>
<v Speaker 2>their own distribution networks.</v>

152
00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:43.410
<v Speaker 2>This was all happening by the year 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>at this time,</v>

153
00:07:43.440 --> 00:07:45.630
<v Speaker 2>the Cali cartel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was already dismantled,</v>

154
00:07:45.780 --> 00:07:46.613
<v Speaker 2>but cocaine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was still employing a good share of </v>

155
00:07:48.601 --> 00:07:49.860
<v Speaker 2>the Colombian workforce.</v>

156
00:07:53.210 --> 00:07:53.961
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to summarize,</v>

157
00:07:53.961 --> 00:07:54.794
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the office sooner to envision </v>

158
00:07:55.960 --> 00:08:00.740
<v Speaker 2>Gado with don burner as the leader and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then we have FARC on the other hands and</v>

159
00:08:00.741 --> 00:08:04.880
<v Speaker 2>between these two there's also a </v>
<v Speaker 2>plethora of independent drug trafficking</v>

160
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:05.714
<v Speaker 2>bands called the backroom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was during this time the Columbia </v>

161
00:08:08.331 --> 00:08:09.164
<v Speaker 2>chosen you president's Alvara rebate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Early Bay was born in Midian and this </v>

162
00:08:12.681 --> 00:08:15.860
<v Speaker 2>political goal was to end all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence am's.</v>

163
00:08:15.861 --> 00:08:16.694
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this marks the beginning of the tox </v>

164
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.093
<v Speaker 2>mafioso oh Volvo or rebate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it ready to end the guerrilla </v>

165
00:08:25.041 --> 00:08:28.160
<v Speaker 2>warriors and the right wing groups at </v>
<v Speaker 2>any cost.</v>

166
00:08:28.190 --> 00:08:29.023
<v Speaker 2>This is why in the year 2005 is Defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>Minister Camilo or Spina signed the law </v>

167
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 2>that is thought of with sadness in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombia.</v>

168
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:39.170
<v Speaker 2>This law was directive zero to nine and </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

169
00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:40.460
<v Speaker 2>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

170
00:08:40.461 --> 00:08:43.230
<v Speaker 2>what's so sad about that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It sounds like it could be a good thing.</v>

171
00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:44.153
<v Speaker 4>This directive said literally that the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government would give the equivalent of </v>

172
00:08:47.431 --> 00:08:48.264
<v Speaker 4>1900 US dollars to anyone who would </v>
<v Speaker 4>murder a guerrilla fighter or a </v>

173
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.540
<v Speaker 4>paramilitary,</v>
<v Speaker 4>right wing fighter.</v>

174
00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:58.930
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

175
00:08:58.931 --> 00:09:00.810
<v Speaker 2>if you were a soldier in the Colombian </v>
<v Speaker 2>army ends,</v>

176
00:09:00.820 --> 00:09:01.653
<v Speaker 2>you wanted to have a good career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All you had to do was get out and go on </v>

177
00:09:04.361 --> 00:09:06.250
<v Speaker 2>a man Hans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden,</v>

178
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:08.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the death toll at Fark Ama narcos,</v>

179
00:09:08.740 --> 00:09:09.573
<v Speaker 2>it absolutely skyrocketed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hold on a minute because this was </v>

180
00:09:12.341 --> 00:09:14.470
<v Speaker 2>just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finding FARC members,</v>

181
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:15.363
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't an easy job,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rewards given by the Colombian </v>

182
00:09:17.801 --> 00:09:20.170
<v Speaker 2>government was really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really tempting.</v>

183
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:23.680
<v Speaker 2>This is why a lots of soldiers started </v>
<v Speaker 2>killing innocent civilians.</v>

184
00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:24.723
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would dress the metaphoric uniform </v>

185
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.243
<v Speaker 2>and take a picture of the dad's body.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was enough to go to the government </v>

186
00:09:30.161 --> 00:09:30.994
<v Speaker 2>office and gets the money and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>something that happens way more than </v>

187
00:09:33.911 --> 00:09:36.070
<v Speaker 2>once or twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is even a name for it.</v>

188
00:09:36.071 --> 00:09:36.904
<v Speaker 2>In Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dad civilians were called false </v>

189
00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:42.310
<v Speaker 2>positives and it became a major way for </v>
<v Speaker 2>people to make money in Colombia.</v>

190
00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:43.263
<v Speaker 2>It's still today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Colombian justice system has over </v>

191
00:09:45.401 --> 00:09:49.660
<v Speaker 2>3000 ongoing cases of false positives </v>
<v Speaker 2>that need to be investigated.</v>

192
00:09:49.690 --> 00:09:52.030
<v Speaker 2>But wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because while the policies of presidents</v>

193
00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:54.190
<v Speaker 2>or rebate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're extremely controversial,</v>

194
00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:58.630
<v Speaker 2>one thing has to be set.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He made it way more complicated for FARC</v>

195
00:09:58.631 --> 00:10:01.480
<v Speaker 2>guerrilla warriors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>raids on cocaine fields and distribution</v>

196
00:10:01.481 --> 00:10:02.980
<v Speaker 2>networks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They became the norm.</v>

197
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:05.590
<v Speaker 2>And when your enemy is killing dozens of</v>
<v Speaker 2>your members,</v>

198
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.460
<v Speaker 2>you are willing to sign an alliance with</v>
<v Speaker 2>the devil himself.</v>

199
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.203
<v Speaker 4>Some emails prove the links between the </v>
<v Speaker 4>FARC and the narco traffickers and one </v>

200
00:10:18.231 --> 00:10:19.064
<v Speaker 4>of the messages and Middle Kaneko Oh </v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea leader shows a clear connection </v>

201
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:25.970
<v Speaker 4>with the OPC and the end of the Godell.</v>

202
00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:30.833
<v Speaker 2>As we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck would present at all the </v>

203
00:10:32.041 --> 00:10:33.720
<v Speaker 2>plantations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some cases,</v>

204
00:10:33.721 --> 00:10:36.500
<v Speaker 2>those plantations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they belonged to the office scene to end</v>

205
00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.990
<v Speaker 2>Gatto or some belongs to the back room </v>
<v Speaker 2>that we mentioned earlier.</v>

206
00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:43.310
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes patients were managed directly</v>

207
00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.153
<v Speaker 2>by fog.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These aren't where they grew and </v>

208
00:10:45.901 --> 00:10:49.230
<v Speaker 2>processed cocoa leaves and turns them </v>
<v Speaker 2>into white powder.</v>

209
00:10:49.290 --> 00:10:50.123
<v Speaker 2>Then the big cartels steps into </v>
<v Speaker 2>distributes the cocaine to other </v>

210
00:10:52.801 --> 00:10:54.120
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

211
00:10:54.150 --> 00:10:54.983
<v Speaker 2>unlike the times of Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombian cartels and no longer have a </v>

212
00:10:57.391 --> 00:11:02.391
<v Speaker 2>monopoly over distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

213
00:11:03.631 --> 00:11:07.710
<v Speaker 2>when those Columbia narcos want to send </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] to the u s they partner with</v>

214
00:11:07.711 --> 00:11:10.570
<v Speaker 2>Mexican drug dealers when they want to </v>
<v Speaker 2>send it to Europe.</v>

215
00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:13.470
<v Speaker 2>They work with Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Greek and Albanian mafias,</v>

216
00:11:13.530 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 2>but we're going to talk about all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that in another video and not today.</v>

217
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:17.533
<v Speaker 4>The important thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 4>despite drug trafficking still being an </v>

218
00:11:20.181 --> 00:11:23.000
<v Speaker 4>issue today,</v>
<v Speaker 4>metagene is now a peaceful city.</v>

219
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:23.953
<v Speaker 4>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there are still bad neighborhoods where </v>

220
00:11:24.951 --> 00:11:27.560
<v Speaker 4>it's better not to walk through,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially on the outskirts of the city,</v>

221
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.100
<v Speaker 4>but the city has made a big change </v>
<v Speaker 4>change for the better.</v>

222
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.053
<v Speaker 2>This pax mafioso has allowed all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>players involved with the cocaine </v>

223
00:11:34.851 --> 00:11:35.684
<v Speaker 2>business to make an agreement so that </v>
<v Speaker 2>each of them has their territories and </v>

224
00:11:38.721 --> 00:11:40.670
<v Speaker 2>they have no reason to kill each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

225
00:11:40.671 --> 00:11:41.504
<v Speaker 2>cocaine is now easier to find than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's less people die during the </v>

226
00:11:44.811 --> 00:11:45.280
<v Speaker 2>process.</v>

227
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:46.113
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

228
00:11:51.130 --> 00:11:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering,</v>

229
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:52.953
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can happen that FARC have made a </v>

230
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 2>peace agreements with the Colombian </v>
<v Speaker 2>government?</v>

231
00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.480
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this could become an opportunity for the</v>

232
00:11:58.481 --> 00:11:59.314
<v Speaker 2>background to take back control of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business that is now in the qubit as </v>

233
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:04.250
<v Speaker 2>Hams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is these Nike's,</v>

234
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.223
<v Speaker 2>they're also trying to get a peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreement with the government that is </v>

235
