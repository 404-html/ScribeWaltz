00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:00.873
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's [inaudible] has become the biggest </v>

2
00:00:01.921 --> 00:00:04.470
<v Speaker 1>threat to the euro zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this?</v>

3
00:00:04.471 --> 00:00:05.304
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're going to tell you in </v>

4
00:00:06.001 --> 00:00:06.834
<v Speaker 1>this video.</v>

5
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

6
00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:18.320
<v Speaker 1>the cradle of the West,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place of pastor pizza and pop.</v>

7
00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:20.530
<v Speaker 1>You like coffee making techniques like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cappuccino,</v>

8
00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 1>ristretto and espresso.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all in SLA,</v>

9
00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.560
<v Speaker 1>but in addition to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really,</v>

10
00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.250
<v Speaker 1>it has become quite a headache for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe's leaders.</v>

11
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.121
<v Speaker 1>No ones are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:28.121 --> 00:00:32.230
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a giant of the could</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into a true titanic.</v>

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.893
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

14
00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.860
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about an economic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis that could make greases</v>

15
00:00:40.861 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>crisis look like child's play.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

16
00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:46.320
<v Speaker 1>it's only currently has the eighth </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest economy in the world,</v>

17
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.183
<v Speaker 1>but this country isn't growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's banking system has loads of </v>

18
00:00:49.471 --> 00:00:52.110
<v Speaker 1>problems and it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments is hugely in debt.</v>

19
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.003
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is at least public debt already </v>

20
00:00:53.791 --> 00:00:54.624
<v Speaker 1>surpasses 130% of its GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that even though it has the </v>

21
00:00:57.601 --> 00:01:00.720
<v Speaker 1>fourth largest economy in the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union off to Germany,</v>

22
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:01.554
<v Speaker 1>the United Kingdom and France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also has the largest public debt </v>

23
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.943
<v Speaker 1>stock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This amounts to more than two point $5 </v>

24
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:08.753
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Italian public debt folks is twice </v>

25
00:01:10.261 --> 00:01:11.094
<v Speaker 1>the size of the entire Mexican economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd almost four times the size of the </v>

26
00:01:14.671 --> 00:01:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Swiss economy and that's if you didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure out is a lot of it.</v>

27
00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:19.633
<v Speaker 2>Money</v>

28
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Prolo doesn't even begin to end that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian economy is hardly growing.</v>

29
00:01:31.521 --> 00:01:33.710
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't managed to get back to its pre</v>

30
00:01:33.711 --> 00:01:35.960
<v Speaker 1>2008 crisis levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment,</v>

31
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>it's a pass is 10% and youth </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment lies at around 40%</v>

32
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:44.633
<v Speaker 1>total of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to add the fact that year after </v>

33
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:47.034
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public debt continues to rise and it </v>

34
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.133
<v Speaker 1>won't stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country has a very big population </v>

35
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:53.790
<v Speaker 1>with an agent problem and above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Central Bank,</v>

36
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:58.140
<v Speaker 1>which in recent years has been Italy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest public debt purchaser could soon</v>

37
00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.063
<v Speaker 1>stop doing that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>European Central Bank says it's massive </v>

38
00:02:02.641 --> 00:02:05.340
<v Speaker 1>bond buying program will likely end in </v>
<v Speaker 1>December.</v>

39
00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.820
<v Speaker 1>All of that said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can easily understand news like this.</v>

40
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.320
<v Speaker 1>Italy is pushing Europe to the brink of </v>
<v Speaker 1>another economic crisis.</v>

41
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>The Italian crisis that is making the EU</v>
<v Speaker 1>tremble worsens.</v>

42
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.073
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there something you might not be </v>

43
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:20.010
<v Speaker 1>wondering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:20.790
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

45
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 1>I get it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is hardly new.</v>

46
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:23.790
<v Speaker 1>It's at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's been a problem for ages.</v>

47
00:02:23.791 --> 00:02:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Why we spotlighting it now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.920
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you government a step </v>
<v Speaker 1>back after months of uncertainty,</v>

49
00:02:39.661 --> 00:02:44.310
<v Speaker 1>a new government finally gained power in</v>
<v Speaker 1>June of 2018 and we're not talking about</v>

50
00:02:44.311 --> 00:02:45.150
<v Speaker 1>just any governor</v>

51
00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.133
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

52
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.380
<v Speaker 1>led by the new prime minister just sat </v>
<v Speaker 1>by [inaudible].</v>

53
00:02:49.381 --> 00:02:50.214
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a government formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the euro skeptic and antisystem </v>

54
00:02:52.981 --> 00:02:53.814
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fivestars ends by La Liga and extremely </v>

55
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:57.354
<v Speaker 1>far right wing party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This new coalition arrived with a very </v>

56
00:02:59.321 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 1>clear idea in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's at least sovereignty would again be</v>

57
00:03:02.621 --> 00:03:03.454
<v Speaker 1>in room and not in Brussels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in most cases wouldn't mean </v>

58
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.620
<v Speaker 1>anything except a higher expense.</v>

59
00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that as you know,</v>

60
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>the countries that belonged to the euro </v>
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>

61
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.000
<v Speaker 1>that is those that share the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency agree on certain goals with the</v>

62
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:19.834
<v Speaker 1>European authorities as well as on some </v>
<v Speaker 1>maximum public deficit levels and on a </v>

63
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:27.010
<v Speaker 1>path of these deficits have to follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the years.</v>

64
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.903
<v Speaker 1>All of this is done to maintain their </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability and solvency and thus reduce </v>

65
00:03:30.911 --> 00:03:33.760
<v Speaker 1>the risk of crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:33.761 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>the new Italian government does not like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one yet.</v>

67
00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>Deficit path,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

68
00:03:37.781 --> 00:03:39.520
<v Speaker 1>come on now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're not going to tell me how to spend</v>

69
00:03:39.521 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 1>my money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

70
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.463
<v Speaker 1>and this is more or less what the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>government must have fought because one </v>

71
00:03:44.141 --> 00:03:44.974
<v Speaker 1>of the first things they did was present</v>
<v Speaker 1>a budget proposal in September for a </v>

72
00:03:48.191 --> 00:03:51.700
<v Speaker 1>public deficits that is substantially </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger than the one they committed to in</v>

73
00:03:51.701 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>Brussels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that is when the earthquake happens,</v>

74
00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:56.383
<v Speaker 1>it'll eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defies the European Union and increases </v>

75
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.614
<v Speaker 1>their deficits.</v>

76
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:00.483
<v Speaker 1>2.4%</v>
<v Speaker 1>of GDP and you have government wanting </v>

77
00:04:02.711 --> 00:04:03.544
<v Speaker 1>to spend money that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's got a public debt problem and </v>

78
00:04:05.381 --> 00:04:06.214
<v Speaker 1>now they want to ask for a higher dance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well I'm seeing is believing because </v>

79
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:11.530
<v Speaker 1>folks 2.4%</v>
<v Speaker 1>might sound low,</v>

80
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.423
<v Speaker 1>but if we take the facts that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian economy is forecasted to not </v>

81
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:17.920
<v Speaker 1>grow more than 1% in the upcoming years </v>
<v Speaker 1>into accounts,</v>

82
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.130
<v Speaker 1>then things really do change because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 2.4%</v>

83
00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.470
<v Speaker 1>now means that with every year that </v>
<v Speaker 1>passes,</v>

84
00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.020
<v Speaker 1>Italy will become less solvent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

85
00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:29.140
<v Speaker 1>it will be even less able to pay off its</v>
<v Speaker 1>debts.</v>

86
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.033
<v Speaker 1>So do you know what came of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>dialogue between the new euro skeptic </v>

87
00:04:32.111 --> 00:04:34.000
<v Speaker 1>governments in Brussels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.170
<v Speaker 1>since just on says new governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>orientation was exposed,</v>

89
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:40.004
<v Speaker 1>the 10 year Italian bonds profitability </v>
<v Speaker 1>sorted by more than 90% that is </v>

90
00:04:43.461 --> 00:04:44.294
<v Speaker 1>investors now understand that there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very high risk and therefore they </v>

91
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:49.550
<v Speaker 1>require a higher profitability if </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to lend them money.</v>

92
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.790
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this means that every time the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian government issues debt,</v>

93
00:04:52.791 --> 00:04:53.624
<v Speaker 1>it has to include higher interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cleans that up to the year 2020 it's </v>

94
00:04:58.281 --> 00:05:02.330
<v Speaker 1>only we'll have to face debt maturities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of almost $600 billion and a balance.</v>

95
00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Of course it'll have to request again </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the markets along with the deficits</v>

96
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:08.600
<v Speaker 1>that it has accumulated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until then,</v>

97
00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.670
<v Speaker 1>this amounts to more than $700 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an insane number.</v>

98
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:16.693
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hit investors ask for more </v>

99
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:19.340
<v Speaker 1>profitability.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interests will be higher and so will the</v>

100
00:05:19.341 --> 00:05:20.174
<v Speaker 1>public deficits and if in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European central bank stops buying </v>

101
00:05:22.911 --> 00:05:25.280
<v Speaker 1>debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could mean even higher interest rates</v>

102
00:05:25.281 --> 00:05:26.114
<v Speaker 1>to the point that this spiral cup at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian government's on the ropes and </v>

103
00:05:28.461 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 1>then its banks as fault,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they own a good part of it are these dat</v>

104
00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:32.173
<v Speaker 1>also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really seem likely that they </v>

105
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 1>will be able to withstand a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>recession.</v>

106
00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:37.453
<v Speaker 1>Italy's banks stumble into a new crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's not all Italy is </v>

107
00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:42.493
<v Speaker 1>Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's huge size cause me the spread of </v>

108
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:46.400
<v Speaker 1>that financial crisis throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire euro zone.</v>

109
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:50.630
<v Speaker 1>That's why the new Italian government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies have led to so much concern.</v>

110
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Italy is a time on the could simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>explode at any moment.</v>

111
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 1>That's why it doesn't seem likely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Central,</v>

112
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:58.183
<v Speaker 1>we'll stop funding the party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only reason Italy isn't already </v>

113
00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.494
<v Speaker 1>rated junk is because the readings </v>
<v Speaker 1>agencies assume the ECB will step in to </v>

114
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 1>prevent a default.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that sense,</v>

115
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Italian bonds are actually German bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Rubino.</v>

116
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.740
<v Speaker 1>The question now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.620
<v Speaker 1>how long can the situation last,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now that we know what's happening,</v>

118
00:06:18.621 --> 00:06:20.960
<v Speaker 1>the question that remains is how did we </v>
<v Speaker 1>get to this point?</v>

119
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

120
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.110
<v Speaker 1>origin of the problem,</v>

121
00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 2>awesome.</v>

122
00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>Long ago we dedicated to video to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>how Italy arrived at the situation.</v>

123
00:06:33.471 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>We can basically summarize it as a lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of competitiveness.</v>

124
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:37.123
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian politicians really didn't care </v>

125
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:41.330
<v Speaker 1>about the economy while for well changed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at full speed.</v>

126
00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:42.203
<v Speaker 1>Italy punished companies with extremely </v>
<v Speaker 1>high taxes and lots of regulations and </v>

127
00:06:47.091 --> 00:06:47.924
<v Speaker 1>that's what all the states kept hiring </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more officials and spending </v>

128
00:06:50.361 --> 00:06:52.640
<v Speaker 1>money without really caring about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

129
00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:53.503
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any one in five young Italians gets a </v>

130
00:06:55.041 --> 00:06:55.874
<v Speaker 1>university degree or race.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's almost half of the ovc d average </v>

131
00:06:58.820 --> 00:06:59.653
<v Speaker 1>as of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you aren't educating your youth and </v>

132
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:02.960
<v Speaker 1>forget about being competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:07:02.961 --> 00:07:03.794
<v Speaker 1>what else can you expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that weren't enough by adopting the </v>

134
00:07:07.041 --> 00:07:07.874
<v Speaker 1>euro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian politicians can no longer use </v>

135
00:07:09.351 --> 00:07:11.870
<v Speaker 1>one of their favorite tricks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>devaluing the currency.</v>

136
00:07:12.020 --> 00:07:15.140
<v Speaker 1>So this folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what explains the dark news that</v>

137
00:07:15.141 --> 00:07:16.520
<v Speaker 1>we occasionally see in the media.</v>

138
00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:19.730
<v Speaker 1>As you can probably see the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all rather complicated.</v>

139
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:20.564
<v Speaker 1>And here are visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to try and keep up with all </v>

140
00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:23.870
<v Speaker 1>the events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now as your time,</v>

141
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:26.960
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the Italian government</v>
<v Speaker 1>should break with Brussels?</v>

142
00:07:26.961 --> 00:07:27.794
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
