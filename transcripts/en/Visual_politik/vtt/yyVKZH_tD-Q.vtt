1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:04.250
<v Speaker 1>Devi was Argentina is not exactly having</v>
<v Speaker 1>its best moments.</v>

2
00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:11.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:16.003
<v Speaker 1>Mauricio Macri has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government has had to ask for a bailout </v>

4
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.620
<v Speaker 1>from the International Monetary Fund.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is this,</v>

5
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:22.640
<v Speaker 1>in the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crises,</v>

6
00:00:22.641 --> 00:00:23.474
<v Speaker 1>devaluations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation and payment suspensions has </v>

7
00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 1>become commonplace in Argentina as </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and the economy.</v>

8
00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.860
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>throughout this entire process,</v>

9
00:00:30.861 --> 00:00:33.640
<v Speaker 1>one political movement has had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolute influence.</v>

10
00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.503
<v Speaker 1>Perrona isn't it?</v>

11
00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.440
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

12
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.513
<v Speaker 1>What exactly is this political stream </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as Peronas and how did it come </v>

13
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:57.850
<v Speaker 1>about and what impact has it really has </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Argentina?</v>

14
00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:58.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about it all on </v>

15
00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:00.304
<v Speaker 1>visual politic in two videos and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first one we're going to focus on its </v>

16
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.040
<v Speaker 1>origins and its identity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen up.</v>

17
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.283
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

18
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was Kwan Domingo,</v>

19
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.100
<v Speaker 1>Peron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly,</v>

20
00:01:19.101 --> 00:01:19.934
<v Speaker 1>how did he manage to gain power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence in Argentine politics for </v>

21
00:01:23.031 --> 00:01:24.560
<v Speaker 1>seven decades?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:24.561 --> 00:01:25.394
<v Speaker 1>it's the beginning of this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have to go all the way back to the </v>

23
00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>1930s that time Argentine nationalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in its golden age,</v>

24
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was undoubtedly Latin America's great</v>

25
00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like the 1929 crisis.</v>

26
00:01:43.531 --> 00:01:44.364
<v Speaker 1>It was still one of the 10 richest </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world and wages were </v>

27
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.920
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much higher than in Europe.</v>

28
00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.860
<v Speaker 1>How has the way to second tier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in spite of this,</v>

29
00:01:58.861 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 1>the 1929 crisis had taken its toll </v>
<v Speaker 1>hitting the country hard.</v>

30
00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:03.743
<v Speaker 1>The tension led to the first military </v>
<v Speaker 1>coup in 1930 [inaudible] support is by </v>

31
00:02:06.961 --> 00:02:09.570
<v Speaker 1>many political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and social sectors,</v>

32
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.970
<v Speaker 1>especially on the conservative side of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

33
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.980
<v Speaker 1>This militaristic authoritarians </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalists,</v>

34
00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 1>Panorama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's became customer ether.</v>

35
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.230
<v Speaker 1>Many officers of the origin time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amit did,</v>

36
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.440
<v Speaker 1>he sent to Germany and Italy to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>advanced courses.</v>

37
00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.743
<v Speaker 1>Debbie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you know who one of these </v>

38
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:36.940
<v Speaker 1>officers was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

39
00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.850
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be Juan Domingo Peron who was</v>

40
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:40.684
<v Speaker 1>sent to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a a country where he met and </v>

41
00:02:42.131 --> 00:02:42.964
<v Speaker 1>studied firsthand how Benito </v>
<v Speaker 1>Miscellaneous governments was organized </v>

42
00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:46.803
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon after he'd get the chance to put </v>

43
00:02:48.551 --> 00:02:50.470
<v Speaker 1>this knowledge right into practice,</v>

44
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.433
<v Speaker 1>you see as the beginning of the 1940s </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina was under the control of a </v>

45
00:02:57.801 --> 00:02:58.634
<v Speaker 1>corrupt and authoritarians governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and governments that had perpetuated </v>

46
00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:02.343
<v Speaker 1>electoral fraud and attempted to stay in</v>
<v Speaker 1>power at all costs under these </v>

47
00:03:09.811 --> 00:03:10.644
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On June the fourth of 1943 a group of </v>

48
00:03:13.021 --> 00:03:17.970
<v Speaker 1>young officers in the Argentine army </v>
<v Speaker 1>held a coup to tar supposedly to restore</v>

49
00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.893
<v Speaker 1>a transparent electoral system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of these offices was our </v>

50
00:03:21.781 --> 00:03:25.610
<v Speaker 1>protagonist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leftenant Colonel Hon Domingo Peron.</v>

51
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

52
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.633
<v Speaker 1>this was Argentina's second cue to tar </v>
<v Speaker 1>off to the 1930s one but don't think it </v>

53
00:03:34.811 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 1>was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lost.</v>

54
00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the next 30 years.</v>

55
00:03:38.111 --> 00:03:38.944
<v Speaker 1>The country has suffered for more keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The case is dear viewers that it was </v>

56
00:03:45.751 --> 00:03:46.584
<v Speaker 1>this 1943 q which opens the doors to </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics and power for lefthand and </v>

57
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.004
<v Speaker 1>Colonel [inaudible] Domingo Peron.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can practically see that this is </v>

58
00:03:53.551 --> 00:03:56.940
<v Speaker 1>where Argentina's modern history began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen up</v>

59
00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:12.893
<v Speaker 1>two and a half years that the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>government lasted Paranas Korea was </v>

60
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:16.433
<v Speaker 1>meteoric.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was despite the fact that until </v>

61
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:21.800
<v Speaker 1>then had held a very low rank positions </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as head of the Department of Labor,</v>

62
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.950
<v Speaker 1>a position that in principle was mad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do I say it's rather bureaucratic?</v>

63
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.813
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second because thanks to his </v>

64
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:28.584
<v Speaker 1>political intelligence product managed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can use this position as a </v>

65
00:04:31.141 --> 00:04:34.260
<v Speaker 1>springboard for his rise to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see it from the very beginning,</v>

66
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:35.094
<v Speaker 1>quantum and go [inaudible] and used </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything had learned on the Benito </v>

67
00:04:37.351 --> 00:04:42.351
<v Speaker 1>Mussolini in Italy starting by winning </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the unions support that way each</v>

68
00:04:45.031 --> 00:04:45.864
<v Speaker 1>time the labor department's had to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene in a conflict between </v>

69
00:04:48.271 --> 00:04:50.190
<v Speaker 1>employers and unions related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

70
00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 1>the former.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The employers would almost always lose.</v>

71
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.923
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this meant that this man's popularity </v>

72
00:04:57.001 --> 00:04:58.410
<v Speaker 1>didn't stop grabbing.</v>

73
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.400
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

74
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.233
<v Speaker 1>shortly after I put on was appointed </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister of war and then vice </v>

75
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or without forgetting the labor policies</v>

76
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 1>and the unions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if something was very,</v>

77
00:05:11.071 --> 00:05:11.904
<v Speaker 1>very clear to this leftenant colonel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was that that would be as political </v>

78
00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:15.834
<v Speaker 1>springboard.</v>

79
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.213
<v Speaker 1>He wasn't the only one aspiring to power</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so much prominence led to a lot of </v>

80
00:05:27.151 --> 00:05:27.984
<v Speaker 1>jealousy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much so that the military leaders </v>

81
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.533
<v Speaker 1>asked him to move away from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments in 1945 so we could perhaps </v>

82
00:05:33.961 --> 00:05:37.650
<v Speaker 1>expect this to be the ends of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>military man's political career.</v>

83
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.760
<v Speaker 1>Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

84
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:39.743
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing could be further from the truth </v>

85
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:46.380
<v Speaker 1>on had learned how much influence the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media could have in Europe.</v>

86
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.214
<v Speaker 1>So he asked his superiors if he could </v>
<v Speaker 1>say goodbye through the national radio </v>

87
00:05:50.161 --> 00:05:54.240
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They naively accepted in Parana,</v>

88
00:05:54.241 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>took full advantage of this opportunity </v>
<v Speaker 1>in his farewell.</v>

89
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 1>She thinks the working passes for that </v>
<v Speaker 1>support and the questions,</v>

90
00:06:00.441 --> 00:06:03.130
<v Speaker 1>the continuity of the social benefits </v>
<v Speaker 1>that had removed.</v>

91
00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:14.470
<v Speaker 4>Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hey Paul,</v>

92
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.933
<v Speaker 4>bobby,</v>

93
00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:31.803
<v Speaker 3>hello.</v>

94
00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>It has a huge effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the following days,</v>

95
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:40.784
<v Speaker 1>the unions mobilized in his favor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ends on October the 17th thousands of </v>

96
00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>workers occupied the plaza de Mayo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nerve center of Argentine politics,</v>

97
00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>the government disorientated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

98
00:07:01.091 --> 00:07:02.590
<v Speaker 1>events unfolded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>asked for you.</v>

99
00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:06.310
<v Speaker 1>Leftenant colonel himself to appease the</v>
<v Speaker 1>masses and this is something he did,</v>

100
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:09.460
<v Speaker 1>but only after agreeing that he'd be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate in the next elections.</v>

101
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.000
<v Speaker 1>He also made sure that he had the </v>
<v Speaker 1>support of the public powers.</v>

102
00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:23.933
<v Speaker 1>Why does it make you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it person has managed to become a </v>

103
00:07:25.651 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 1>candidate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now he needed to win the election.</v>

104
00:07:30.090 --> 00:07:33.510
<v Speaker 1>We've seen at the time Argentina was </v>
<v Speaker 1>under military control,</v>

105
00:07:33.511 --> 00:07:34.344
<v Speaker 1>so governments authorization was </v>
<v Speaker 1>required to hold meetings and electoral </v>

106
00:07:38.041 --> 00:07:39.240
<v Speaker 1>act when no accident.</v>

107
00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:40.133
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

108
00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:46.030
<v Speaker 1>Goals per ron's campaign actions were </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost automatically authorized.</v>

109
00:07:46.031 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his opponent swelled for,</v>

110
00:07:47.441 --> 00:07:50.710
<v Speaker 1>let's just say the process was much </v>
<v Speaker 1>slower and not only that,</v>

111
00:07:50.711 --> 00:07:51.544
<v Speaker 1>but Peran also had complete access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important means of </v>

112
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:54.754
<v Speaker 1>communication at the time the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio station because it was owned by </v>

113
00:07:57.881 --> 00:07:58.714
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not old man zipper on his insistence </v>

114
00:08:08.671 --> 00:08:09.504
<v Speaker 1>that government's approved paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacations for all workers as well as </v>

115
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.340
<v Speaker 1>additional salary at the end of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

116
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:15.263
<v Speaker 1>These are all things that make you look </v>
<v Speaker 1>very good to your electorate and it was </v>

117
00:08:17.681 --> 00:08:18.514
<v Speaker 1>still a move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This genius of political strategies an </v>

118
00:08:20.471 --> 00:08:21.870
<v Speaker 1>interest to use very well.</v>

119
00:08:23.350 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

120
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:24.723
<v Speaker 1>the State Department of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States itself intervenes in bronze </v>

121
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:28.234
<v Speaker 1>rivals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns publishing gay reports known </v>

122
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:30.633
<v Speaker 1>as the Blue Book,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well put on his activities and those of </v>

123
00:08:32.531 --> 00:08:35.920
<v Speaker 1>his military allies were shown to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support the Nazi regime.</v>

124
00:08:39.680 --> 00:08:40.513
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brawn managed to turn this around since </v>

125
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:43.003
<v Speaker 1>morphed into something like a struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>between himself who represented </v>

126
00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Argentines sovereignty in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

127
00:08:48.140 --> 00:08:48.973
<v Speaker 1>In the end is all these tactics copied </v>
<v Speaker 1>to years later by populist governments </v>

128
00:08:51.891 --> 00:08:55.440
<v Speaker 1>throughout Latin America won the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections for per on the victory.</v>

129
00:08:55.441 --> 00:08:57.630
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't overwhelming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was enough.</v>

130
00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:09.833
<v Speaker 1>Very important factor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Kwanza Mingo Peron came to </v>

131
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.624
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina was one of the 10 most </v>

132
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>prosperous and richest economies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>

133
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:19.590
<v Speaker 1>The country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was even an international credits are</v>

134
00:09:19.591 --> 00:09:22.500
<v Speaker 1>countries like the United Kingdom </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually owed him money.</v>

135
00:09:22.530 --> 00:09:25.440
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new president's had more than enough</v>

136
00:09:25.441 --> 00:09:27.690
<v Speaker 1>resources to launch his political </v>
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

137
00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:31.100
<v Speaker 1>A program based on three pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political sovereignty,</v>

138
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>economic independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and social justice.</v>

139
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:34.523
<v Speaker 1>In practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he transforms Argentina into a kind of </v>

140
00:09:36.930 --> 00:09:39.510
<v Speaker 1>army under the command of a single </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>

141
00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:43.830
<v Speaker 1>It's president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'll spur on,</v>

142
00:09:43.890 --> 00:09:46.020
<v Speaker 1>managed him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalize a lot of companies,</v>

143
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:49.350
<v Speaker 1>especially those related to public </v>
<v Speaker 1>services such as transport,</v>

144
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.213
<v Speaker 1>energy and communications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also plays to banking under </v>

145
00:09:52.591 --> 00:09:55.980
<v Speaker 1>governmental control into proved a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of foreign trade restriction</v>

146
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>and he also achieved a lot of popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

147
00:10:01.861 --> 00:10:03.060
<v Speaker 1>So how did he do it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:10:03.061 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 1>he did it by maintaining utility rates </v>
<v Speaker 1>even below that cost and hiring a lot of</v>

149
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:10.440
<v Speaker 1>employees for the governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for governmental companies,</v>

150
00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:11.333
<v Speaker 1>and it's certainly not so much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>coincidence that the coach and has 60 </v>

151
00:10:13.621 --> 00:10:16.050
<v Speaker 1>years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did practically the same thing.</v>

152
00:10:16.110 --> 00:10:16.943
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this involved a lot of spending </v>

153
00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.670
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you think he financed it?</v>

154
00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:21.693
<v Speaker 1>Of course he started printing your money</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the addiction of </v>

155
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>Argentinian politicians printing bills </v>
<v Speaker 1>came from.</v>

156
00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that during the first years </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this entire process,</v>

157
00:10:38.851 --> 00:10:41.730
<v Speaker 1>and thanks to all the money that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>injected into the economy,</v>

158
00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.580
<v Speaker 1>things seemed to be actually sealing </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty smoothly.</v>

159
00:10:44.610 --> 00:10:46.290
<v Speaker 1>So what was the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

160
00:10:46.291 --> 00:10:47.124
<v Speaker 1>it simply wasn't sustainable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government over spends and the </v>

161
00:10:49.441 --> 00:10:52.740
<v Speaker 1>country's competitiveness began to sink </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the titanic.</v>

162
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.660
<v Speaker 1>Within a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're positive balance,</v>

163
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:56.760
<v Speaker 1>vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Private investment collapsed.</v>

164
00:10:56.761 --> 00:11:00.020
<v Speaker 1>And so suddenly at some prices started </v>
<v Speaker 1>to skyrocket.</v>

165
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.933
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

166
00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:04.353
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think happened then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that given that his </v>

167
00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:08.560
<v Speaker 1>revolution didn't seem to be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right track,</v>

168
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.300
<v Speaker 1>per on foot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a bit of the blame?</v>

169
00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

170
00:11:11.201 --> 00:11:12.370
<v Speaker 1>he didn't at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

171
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.293
<v Speaker 1>he blamed alleged speculators of </v>
<v Speaker 1>attacking the national economy and to </v>

172
00:11:16.661 --> 00:11:19.030
<v Speaker 1>remedy all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he multiplies the government,</v>

173
00:11:19.031 --> 00:11:19.864
<v Speaker 1>controls regulated prices and </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented all kinds of measures that </v>

174
00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:28.111
<v Speaker 1>would even affect red distribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crisis wasn't Peron's only problem.</v>

175
00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.523
<v Speaker 1>The 1853 constitution didn't allow for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>politician to stay in power preventing </v>

176
00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.460
<v Speaker 1>an immediate reelection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So under this scenario,</v>

177
00:11:36.530 --> 00:11:37.630
<v Speaker 1>what do you think he did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:11:37.631 --> 00:11:42.631
<v Speaker 1>listen to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Along with the bill printing machine,</v>

179
00:11:51.161 --> 00:11:54.700
<v Speaker 1>Latin American politicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second toy is constituents,</v>

180
00:11:54.701 --> 00:11:55.960
<v Speaker 1>reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bands.</v>

181
00:11:55.961 --> 00:11:56.794
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bron was no exception in 1949 since the </v>

182
00:12:00.961 --> 00:12:05.100
<v Speaker 1>previous constitution imposed to too </v>
<v Speaker 1>many obstacles to on launched a complete</v>

183
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.400
<v Speaker 1>constitutional reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new constitution placed the state is</v>

184
00:12:08.401 --> 00:12:11.010
<v Speaker 1>the fundamental pillar of Argentinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

185
00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:14.293
<v Speaker 1>Even in the constitution's own preamble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the three pillars of Juan Domingo Peron </v>

186
00:12:17.361 --> 00:12:19.340
<v Speaker 1>is political thesis were included.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

187
00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:21.830
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to be a constitution for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

188
00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.590
<v Speaker 1>but let's take a look at the changes </v>
<v Speaker 1>result.</v>

189
00:12:23.820 --> 00:12:24.653
<v Speaker 5>It's</v>

190
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:29.020
<v Speaker 1>investments or disappeared.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The macro data just got worse.</v>

191
00:12:29.021 --> 00:12:29.854
<v Speaker 1>The country was in crisis and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>public companies in Argentina underwent </v>

192
00:12:32.801 --> 00:12:33.634
<v Speaker 1>swats the Dvsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan state owned oil and </v>

193
00:12:36.041 --> 00:12:39.580
<v Speaker 1>natural gas company underwent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they simply weren't invested in,</v>

194
00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.390
<v Speaker 1>so they suffered from all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>influences and in the end they were very</v>

195
00:12:43.391 --> 00:12:47.160
<v Speaker 1>unproductive and inefficient all to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>detriment of the origin time.</v>

196
00:12:50.910 --> 00:12:52.230
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the new model.</v>

197
00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:53.640
<v Speaker 1>Domingo Peron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dimsum,</v>

198
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.410
<v Speaker 1>it became a poverty making machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

199
00:12:56.411 --> 00:12:59.380
<v Speaker 1>this all happens under the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>cults of this leader.</v>

200
00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.273
<v Speaker 1>The reality to viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Argentine society was in crisis and </v>

201
00:13:02.951 --> 00:13:05.620
<v Speaker 1>it was so fragmented.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's under these circumstances,</v>

202
00:13:05.621 --> 00:13:08.560
<v Speaker 1>in September of 1955 there was a new coo</v>
<v Speaker 1>to top.</v>

203
00:13:08.590 --> 00:13:10.750
<v Speaker 1>This time it was against quantum </v>
<v Speaker 1>domingo.</v>

204
00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:21.680
<v Speaker 6>You got it?</v>
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
