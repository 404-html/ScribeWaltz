00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.430
<v Speaker 2>Qatar is the wealthiest country on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

3
00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.360
<v Speaker 2>They're citizens enjoy a higher GDP per </v>
<v Speaker 2>capita than the Swiss,</v>

4
00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.920
<v Speaker 2>or indeed any of the nationals from any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the other oil rich monarchies.</v>

5
00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.680
<v Speaker 2>But today we are not going to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

6
00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.533
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most important factor of this </v>

7
00:00:23.691 --> 00:00:24.524
<v Speaker 2>country is not their wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nor their absolute monarchy or their </v>

8
00:00:26.781 --> 00:00:27.614
<v Speaker 2>ties with radical terrorist green.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any doubt what made this country famous </v>

9
00:00:36.061 --> 00:00:40.800
<v Speaker 2>can be summarized in just two words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and those words are Algebra zero.</v>

10
00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.723
<v Speaker 2>It is the most influential TV network in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Arab world as one of the most </v>

11
00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:50.490
<v Speaker 2>important news networks on the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

12
00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.373
<v Speaker 2>But at the beginning of the 1990s the </v>
<v Speaker 2>royal family that rules guitar with an </v>

13
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.970
<v Speaker 2>Iron Fist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Al Tawny House had a dream.</v>

14
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to turn the nation into the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hedge and monique leader in the region.</v>

15
00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.780
<v Speaker 2>But the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could they achieve this goal?</v>

16
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.353
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a tiny country with </v>

17
00:01:08.591 --> 00:01:11.230
<v Speaker 2>a smaller population than the city of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago.</v>

18
00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.860
<v Speaker 2>Of course they couldn't rival Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia in the military fields and sharia</v>

19
00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:17.770
<v Speaker 2>law made it impossible to be a financial</v>
<v Speaker 2>powerhouse.</v>

20
00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.753
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their geographical position was nothing </v>

21
00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:24.070
<v Speaker 2>special either.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was only one possible strategy and</v>

22
00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 2>that was the idea of so called soft</v>

23
00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:27.773
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii</v>

24
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 2>and otherwise influenced diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well proper Ganzer.</v>

25
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.433
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qatar has invested more than any other </v>

26
00:01:36.571 --> 00:01:37.404
<v Speaker 2>country in improving their image to </v>
<v Speaker 2>outsiders by doing things like hosting </v>

27
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:41.604
<v Speaker 2>the soccer World Cup in 2020 to a </v>
<v Speaker 2>formula one race and even directly </v>

28
00:01:45.811 --> 00:01:50.811
<v Speaker 2>sponsoring soccer teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Among all these projects,</v>

29
00:01:52.261 --> 00:01:57.090
<v Speaker 2>the most successful am's famous of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>all has to be their TV network,</v>

30
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.013
<v Speaker 2>Algebra Xera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They aren't the market leader in terms </v>

31
00:01:59.851 --> 00:02:02.990
<v Speaker 2>of audience in the entire Arab wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

32
00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.960
<v Speaker 2>their market share some policies all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their rivals put together,</v>

33
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 2>and this is all despite the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the channel is banned in most countries.</v>

34
00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.223
<v Speaker 2>I'll just say rabbi has led to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>overthrow of governments in several </v>

35
00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:26.134
<v Speaker 2>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have amplified the effects of the </v>

36
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.444
<v Speaker 2>Arab spring and they've even become the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unofficial loudspeaker for some </v>

37
00:02:31.631 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 2>terrorist groups since the attacks of </v>
<v Speaker 2>September the 11th Algers era has become</v>

38
00:02:35.801 --> 00:02:36.634
<v Speaker 2>in many ways the only source of </v>
<v Speaker 2>information for understanding what is </v>

39
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:44.770
<v Speaker 2>going on in some parts of the worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even CNN buys their footage.</v>

40
00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:48.700
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are a respected media institution,</v>

41
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.590
<v Speaker 2>but then again you might wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

42
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.710
<v Speaker 2>isn't Al Jazeera just a state propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 2>channel?</v>

43
00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.663
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to what extent should we really trust </v>

44
00:02:56.441 --> 00:02:59.050
<v Speaker 2>their information and it's importantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's their,</v>

45
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we are going to answer all of </v>

46
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:04.450
<v Speaker 2>these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do that,</v>

47
00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.690
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at some history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Importance of being unique.</v>

48
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 2>In 1995 the BBC clothes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Arab channel,</v>

49
00:03:13.741 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 2>because the Saudi government wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>interfere in their editorial process,</v>

50
00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:18.683
<v Speaker 2>150 journalism's got fired.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them are of journalists who were </v>

51
00:03:22.291 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 2>trained at one of the most prestigious </v>
<v Speaker 2>media organizations in the world.</v>

52
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.640
<v Speaker 2>These people have a deep knowledge of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim culture,</v>

53
00:03:29.641 --> 00:03:33.300
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time they couldn't meet </v>
<v Speaker 2>the high standards of Western media.</v>

54
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 2>This is where the emir of Qatar at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

55
00:03:35.491 --> 00:03:37.280
<v Speaker 2>the hammered I'll tawny comes in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>

56
00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:42.403
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

57
00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.790
<v Speaker 2>Tommy had just come to power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>had a clear vision for his country.</v>

58
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.120
<v Speaker 2>He wanted it to become the leader of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic world.</v>

59
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:53.870
<v Speaker 2>In order to achieve that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those 150 unemployed journalists weren't</v>

60
00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:56.630
<v Speaker 2>given an opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As soon as they lost their jobs.</v>

61
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.910
<v Speaker 2>Qatar offered them brands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new ones.</v>

62
00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 2>Now what was their mission?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

63
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:01.303
<v Speaker 2>that was to create a brand new news </v>
<v Speaker 2>network and Arab speaking media route </v>

64
00:04:04.701 --> 00:04:07.700
<v Speaker 2>and led that would meet the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western media bounce.</v>

65
00:04:07.701 --> 00:04:12.701
<v Speaker 2>Benny cost has governments gave them a </v>
<v Speaker 2>$147 million loan and with that,</v>

66
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.470
<v Speaker 2>this team of 150 journalists could by </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of the art studios.</v>

67
00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.610
<v Speaker 2>I've correspondence in many countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>and broadcast through a satellite.</v>

68
00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:26.813
<v Speaker 1>Everything</v>

69
00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.640
<v Speaker 2>little detail was taken care of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

70
00:04:29.641 --> 00:04:32.550
<v Speaker 2>to design their logo via media made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>public contest.</v>

71
00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one,</v>

72
00:04:33.661 --> 00:04:34.494
<v Speaker 2>the one that you see on the screen now </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the winner and as you can see and </v>

73
00:04:37.111 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 2>reads Algers Aaron</v>

74
00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.993
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in 1996 Al Jazeera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means the island in Arabic started </v>

75
00:04:47.531 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>broadcasting to the Arab world in very </v>
<v Speaker 2>little time at all.</v>

76
00:04:50.741 --> 00:04:53.470
<v Speaker 2>They surpass the rest of their rivals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think about it.</v>

77
00:04:53.471 --> 00:04:54.460
<v Speaker 2>I need,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day,</v>

78
00:04:54.461 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 2>Arab TV was extremely boring in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>part of the world.</v>

79
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.863
<v Speaker 2>Freedom of expression doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 2>exist and is therefore tv news just </v>

80
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:04.840
<v Speaker 2>offered official announcements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll zero.</v>

81
00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:05.703
<v Speaker 2>It was different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They had a new problem with criticizing </v>

82
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:12.010
<v Speaker 2>various politicians and royal families.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They showed corruption scandals,</v>

83
00:05:12.011 --> 00:05:12.844
<v Speaker 2>Sam's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they even interviewed political </v>

84
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:14.614
<v Speaker 2>dissonance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this was done in a dynamic style </v>

85
00:05:16.811 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 2>that had never been seen on Arabic </v>
<v Speaker 2>television before.</v>

86
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.000
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the real turning point for elders here,</v>

87
00:05:25.001 --> 00:05:25.834
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was nine 11 or some have been laws and </v>

88
00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 2>use this TV networks or broadcast his </v>
<v Speaker 2>claim to the terrorist attack.</v>

89
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:34.290
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the name Algebra Syrup was being said on</v>

90
00:05:34.291 --> 00:05:35.124
<v Speaker 2>TV.</v>
<v Speaker 2>News arounds the wells butts and </v>

91
00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 2>autonomy that a month after the </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attack,</v>

92
00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.850
<v Speaker 2>the American government declared war on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Afghanistan.</v>

93
00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:42.743
<v Speaker 2>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the big media corporations like CNN </v>

94
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:47.880
<v Speaker 2>or CNBC had correspondence in Tokyo,</v>
<v Speaker 2>London,</v>

95
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:48.714
<v Speaker 2>or Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no one had thought Kabul would </v>

96
00:05:50.491 --> 00:05:51.590
<v Speaker 2>be that newsletter.</v>

97
00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:52.723
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

98
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:56.103
<v Speaker 2>Don's well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dessie did an office in the Afghan </v>

99
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.300
<v Speaker 2>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

100
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:00.253
<v Speaker 2>That would be Algebra Jazeera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since they were a channel targeted to </v>

101
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:03.644
<v Speaker 2>the Muslim world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had correspondence in all of the </v>

102
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:06.254
<v Speaker 2>Muslim countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly Algers era footage was </v>

103
00:06:08.211 --> 00:06:10.490
<v Speaker 2>appearing on televisions all around the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

104
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.353
<v Speaker 2>This is why in 2004 the emir of Qatar </v>
<v Speaker 2>realized that what he had it not only </v>

105
00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 2>was a powerful tool to reach the Arab </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

106
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:18.553
<v Speaker 2>but indeed the world at large and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is how English elder Xero was born and </v>

107
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:23.864
<v Speaker 2>it was ready to broadcast into the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitive media market in the world </v>

108
00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.940
<v Speaker 2>for United States of America.</v>

109
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.113
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

110
00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:33.543
<v Speaker 2>Then Al Jazeera has become the TV news.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The book's about countries that never </v>

111
00:06:36.671 --> 00:06:39.610
<v Speaker 2>appear on American TV news wants to know</v>
<v Speaker 2>about Africa.</v>

112
00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 2>Well tuned down with was era.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the Middle East?</v>

113
00:06:41.951 --> 00:06:44.140
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>go to Al Jazeera Central Asia.</v>

114
00:06:44.230 --> 00:06:46.120
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're beginning to get the picture.</v>

115
00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:47.273
<v Speaker 2>Lots of do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute because things are not </v>

116
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:52.070
<v Speaker 2>quite as great as they seem to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget to,</v>

117
00:06:52.071 --> 00:06:52.904
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about a TV now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's work that is being paid for by </v>

118
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.690
<v Speaker 2>government in order to influence other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

119
00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.440
<v Speaker 2>Starting to sounds a bit like it might </v>
<v Speaker 2>be propaganda.</v>

120
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's dive a little bit deeper.</v>

121
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:10.980
<v Speaker 2>Islam's on fault.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] as we said before,</v>

122
00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:11.814
<v Speaker 2>Algebra's era was the first Arab TV </v>
<v Speaker 2>network that openly criticized the </v>

123
00:07:15.091 --> 00:07:16.200
<v Speaker 2>governments in other countries.</v>

124
00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 3>We started the revolution back in 2011 </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather.</v>

125
00:07:21.241 --> 00:07:21.400
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:24.790
<v Speaker 2>I'm surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was not always welcome,</v>

127
00:07:24.940 --> 00:07:28.510
<v Speaker 2>especially given that most of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries are dictatorships.</v>

128
00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:29.373
<v Speaker 2>So in 2011 an uprising in Tunisia </v>
<v Speaker 2>started out and the dictator of this </v>

129
00:07:33.161 --> 00:07:35.380
<v Speaker 2>nation abandoned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's all of these facts.</v>

130
00:07:35.381 --> 00:07:37.550
<v Speaker 2>Could have had little to no impact </v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>

131
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.523
<v Speaker 2>There's Al Jazeera handed deep coverage </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this uprising so that it can be seen </v>

132
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since it was a satellite station,</v>

133
00:07:45.191 --> 00:07:46.024
<v Speaker 2>this signal was arriving,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decides all across north Africa and the </v>

134
00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:49.600
<v Speaker 2>Arabian peninsula.</v>

135
00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:50.453
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

136
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:57.100
<v Speaker 2>is how the inhabitants in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and next to Tina,</v>

137
00:07:57.101 --> 00:08:00.190
<v Speaker 2>Ziad like Egypt saw their neighbor's </v>
<v Speaker 2>protesting and thought,</v>

138
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.380
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've also got a dictator.</v>

139
00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:04.390
<v Speaker 2>Couldn't we do something just like that </v>
<v Speaker 2>ends.</v>

140
00:08:04.391 --> 00:08:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nearly every person in oppositions,</v>

141
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:10.210
<v Speaker 2>you've never like had a news show that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they could now watch ads.</v>

142
00:08:10.211 --> 00:08:11.044
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was not something that wins over </v>

143
00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:14.430
<v Speaker 2>and brilliantly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Windows dictator.</v>

144
00:08:14.460 --> 00:08:15.293
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

145
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:18.243
<v Speaker 1>I'll just,</v>

146
00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:22.110
<v Speaker 2>or a shutdown in Egypt as Mubarak fights</v>
<v Speaker 2>for control of Airway,</v>

147
00:08:22.111 --> 00:08:26.220
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

148
00:08:26.221 --> 00:08:27.960
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is the problem here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

149
00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:31.260
<v Speaker 2>censoring the satellite TV station is </v>
<v Speaker 2>harder than it seems.</v>

150
00:08:31.261 --> 00:08:33.660
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can forbid it if you want,</v>

151
00:08:33.750 --> 00:08:37.830
<v Speaker 2>but if someone wants to access the </v>
<v Speaker 2>station and they have a satellite dish,</v>

152
00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:39.600
<v Speaker 2>then technically it's possible.</v>

153
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:41.940
<v Speaker 3>If you were having problems receiving </v>
<v Speaker 3>any allergies,</v>

154
00:08:41.941 --> 00:08:42.774
<v Speaker 3>there are channels.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This guide will take you through the </v>

155
00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:46.420
<v Speaker 3>process of tuning your satellite </v>
<v Speaker 3>receiver,</v>

156
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:48.780
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In a matter of a month,</v>

157
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:49.663
<v Speaker 2>all of these Arab citizens were seeing </v>
<v Speaker 2>then neighboring countries overthrowing </v>

158
00:08:52.731 --> 00:08:57.120
<v Speaker 2>their dictators and this explains in </v>
<v Speaker 2>part the Arab spring phenomenon.</v>

159
00:08:58.950 --> 00:08:59.783
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait a minute again because not </v>

160
00:09:03.241 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 2>everything is perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>

161
00:09:05.311 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Salvagers there it helps to finish off a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of dictatorships,</v>

162
00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.113
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is the people they </v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted on their network when not </v>

163
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:17.270
<v Speaker 2>really any more democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We came down for years.</v>

164
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.483
<v Speaker 2>The Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader </v>
<v Speaker 2>was given his own television show on Al </v>

165
00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.433
<v Speaker 2>Jazeera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even dash the Islamic state was </v>

166
00:09:30.661 --> 00:09:31.494
<v Speaker 2>portrayed by Al Jazeera as Johnston </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition force to al Assad in Syria </v>

167
00:09:35.460 --> 00:09:36.293
<v Speaker 2>and even as a group of moderate rebels.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same happens with other Sunni </v>

168
00:09:39.691 --> 00:09:44.690
<v Speaker 2>radical terrorists like al Qaeda and now</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering is Al Jazeera and</v>

169
00:09:44.691 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 2>network as it stands for radicalism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>against the West?</v>

170
00:09:48.150 --> 00:09:48.983
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is they've also been accused </v>

171
00:09:50.281 --> 00:09:51.114
<v Speaker 2>of just the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just ask the mayor of Bahrain and as </v>

172
00:09:53.890 --> 00:09:54.723
<v Speaker 2>governor,</v>

173
00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:56.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

174
00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.633
<v Speaker 2>Information Nabeel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll hummer told journalists that Al </v>

175
00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.620
<v Speaker 2>Jazeera correspondence had been banned </v>
<v Speaker 2>from Bahrain.</v>

176
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.663
<v Speaker 2>I'll hummer claimed that the station was</v>
<v Speaker 2>a medium for quote Zionist infiltration </v>

177
00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:07.730
<v Speaker 2>of the Gulf</v>

178
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:08.563
<v Speaker 1>free drinks.</v>

179
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.140
<v Speaker 2>Surprised well for many Alphas era is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zionist western propaganda.</v>

180
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.003
<v Speaker 2>While for others it's the TV station of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the radicals in fact is the only common </v>

181
00:10:21.581 --> 00:10:22.414
<v Speaker 2>grounds for Al Jazeera when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ideology is the interests of the ones </v>

182
00:10:25.901 --> 00:10:28.990
<v Speaker 2>who finance them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The royal house of Owl Tawny,</v>

183
00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:34.170
<v Speaker 2>who by the way don't support freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech and that beaks cables claim algae</v>

184
00:10:40.441 --> 00:10:43.610
<v Speaker 2>zero changed coverage to suit Qatari </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy.</v>

185
00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:44.593
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if this doesn't mean they cannot show </v>

186
00:10:45.591 --> 00:10:46.424
<v Speaker 2>the dark side of guitar in fact to </v>
<v Speaker 2>display being paid for by the royal </v>

187
00:10:49.221 --> 00:10:50.054
<v Speaker 2>house.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eldora Xera is more independent than </v>

188
00:10:51.531 --> 00:10:53.330
<v Speaker 2>many other states sponsored news net</v>

189
00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:54.233
<v Speaker 1>blacks</v>

190
00:10:57.510 --> 00:10:58.343
<v Speaker 2>for instance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What you see on the screen here are </v>

191
00:10:59.941 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 2>extracts from a talk show about being </v>
<v Speaker 2>near slave,</v>

192
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:04.720
<v Speaker 2>like whacking conditions suffered by </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>

193
00:11:04.721 --> 00:11:07.140
<v Speaker 2>see work in Qatar as construction </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>

194
00:11:08.980 --> 00:11:09.813
<v Speaker 2>This show foreign trade unionists were </v>
<v Speaker 2>invited and had the chance to open the </v>

195
00:11:12.721 --> 00:11:15.660
<v Speaker 2>criticize the Al Tiny family and their </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies.</v>

196
00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.610
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Algebra,</v>

197
00:11:16.611 --> 00:11:21.570
<v Speaker 2>there is directors are smart enough to </v>
<v Speaker 2>limit that propaganda and not lose their</v>

198
00:11:21.571 --> 00:11:22.404
<v Speaker 2>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course they have an ideology and a </v>

199
00:11:24.601 --> 00:11:25.434
<v Speaker 2>lot of interests to meet but they are </v>
<v Speaker 2>all aware but in today's world you </v>

200
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:32.940
<v Speaker 2>cannot silence the reality of what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening because if you don't tell us,</v>

201
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:38.120
<v Speaker 2>oh this is going to tell it for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The end of the day.</v>

202
00:11:38.921 --> 00:11:42.160
<v Speaker 2>Al Jazeera is forbidden in almost all </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the region,</v>

203
00:11:42.161 --> 00:11:44.320
<v Speaker 2>including Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

204
00:11:44.350 --> 00:11:46.610
<v Speaker 2>they are still the most influential </v>
<v Speaker 2>amels,</v>

205
00:11:46.611 --> 00:11:49.870
<v Speaker 2>most watched TV network.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone knows who pays for them,</v>

206
00:11:49.871 --> 00:11:53.740
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time that they are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only source for many of the topics.</v>

207
00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:54.813
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Al Jazeera model has lots of </v>

208
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:57.153
<v Speaker 2>copycats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2003 the Saudis founded their own </v>

209
00:11:59.171 --> 00:12:00.004
<v Speaker 2>channel ally Realia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Further of the American government has </v>

210
00:12:01.991 --> 00:12:04.950
<v Speaker 2>their own narrative speaking network </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Aha Ron.</v>

211
00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.793
<v Speaker 2>What about Iranian TV?</v>
<v Speaker 2>His farm TV as a Spanish speaking </v>

212
00:12:16.291 --> 00:12:17.124
<v Speaker 2>network paid for by the Iranian </v>
<v Speaker 2>government in order to influence the </v>

213
00:12:19.891 --> 00:12:20.724
<v Speaker 2>Hispanic world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also have an English speaking </v>

214
00:12:22.381 --> 00:12:23.214
<v Speaker 2>channel called press TV and 2005 Russia </v>
<v Speaker 2>launched Russia today also known as </v>

215
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:28.203

<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

217

221
00:12:49.361 --> 00:12:50.194
<v Speaker 2>do you think you'd stop watching Al </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jazeera because you think it's </v>

222
00:12:52.211 --> 00:12:55.330
<v Speaker 2>propaganda or when do you keep enjoying </v>
