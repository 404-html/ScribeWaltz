1
00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic,</v>

2
00:00:10.271 --> 00:00:11.104
<v Speaker 1>we've already made several videos about </v>
<v Speaker 1>how Venezuela is going through its </v>

3
00:00:13.631 --> 00:00:14.464
<v Speaker 1>toughest times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however we still need to address one of </v>

4
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:17.374
<v Speaker 1>the most serious consequences of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivarian Revolution is gigantic </v>

5
00:00:20.621 --> 00:00:21.454
<v Speaker 1>failure and there's no debate here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is adrift with every day that </v>

6
00:00:28.801 --> 00:00:29.634
<v Speaker 1>passes life in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just becomes harder and harder with </v>

7
00:00:32.521 --> 00:00:33.354
<v Speaker 1>some of the highest violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty and inflation indices in the </v>

8
00:00:35.671 --> 00:00:36.504
<v Speaker 1>worlds and with a growing drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>trafficking and organized crime </v>

9
00:00:38.701 --> 00:00:39.511
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many,</v>

10
00:00:39.511 --> 00:00:40.344
<v Speaker 1>many Venezuelans condo find any </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternative to putting some space </v>

11
00:00:43.051 --> 00:00:43.884
<v Speaker 1>between themselves and their homelands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is even behind the country that's </v>

12
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:48.204
<v Speaker 1>falling apart.</v>

13
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:49.243
<v Speaker 2>Ministry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latina,</v>

14
00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 2>so Seattle bullied the Tara.</v>

15
00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you were in a situation like this,</v>

16
00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.020
<v Speaker 1>would any of you have any hope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.213
<v Speaker 1>I would certainly try to escape and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what more and more </v>

18
00:01:04.201 --> 00:01:06.660
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans are doing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the youngest ones.</v>

19
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you might be wondering,</v>

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:08.971
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay Simon,</v>

21
00:01:08.971 --> 00:01:11.550
<v Speaker 1>but how big is this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

22
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.413
<v Speaker 1>what you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the UN's calculations from </v>

23
00:01:13.981 --> 00:01:14.814
<v Speaker 1>2014 to June of 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around at two point 3 million </v>

24
00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:21.780
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans left their country and these</v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers,</v>

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.330
<v Speaker 1>they're not gonna.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stop from growing anytime soon.</v>

26
00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:29.000
<v Speaker 2>See when total of one I see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me see.</v>

27
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:31.830
<v Speaker 2>Hold on the door for them.</v>

28
00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.300
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bolivarian Revolution has caused the</v>

29
00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:37.990
<v Speaker 1>greatest exodus in the history of Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

30
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.883
<v Speaker 1>so listen up.</v>

31
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.080
<v Speaker 3>The exodus,</v>

32
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.480
<v Speaker 1>societies are entities in constant </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement throughout history,</v>

33
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:55.314
<v Speaker 1>migration has been continuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether economic or for political </v>

34
00:01:58.231 --> 00:01:59.064
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to find better opportunities to escape </v>

35
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:04.290
<v Speaker 1>from a threat or simply to escape bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>living conditions.</v>

36
00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.230
<v Speaker 1>People are continually moving from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>place to another,</v>

37
00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:08.063
<v Speaker 3>not that</v>

38
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.800
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an exodus is something quite different.</v>

39
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:13.663
<v Speaker 1>The term exodus refers to the mass </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration of people who are forced to </v>

40
00:02:16.551 --> 00:02:20.030
<v Speaker 1>leave the place where they live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say it isn't about people who</v>

41
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.600
<v Speaker 1>dream of a better life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but people who have to leave in order to</v>

42
00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:24.830
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In general,</v>

43
00:02:24.831 --> 00:02:25.664
<v Speaker 1>throughout history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most common causes have been </v>

44
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:28.190
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>racial,</v>

45
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.083
<v Speaker 1>or religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the most common type of exodus </v>

46
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:31.443
<v Speaker 1>throughout history has been that bite </v>
<v Speaker 1>people forced to leave their homes </v>

47
00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>because another stronger group took over</v>
<v Speaker 1>and expelled them.</v>

48
00:02:37.031 --> 00:02:37.864
<v Speaker 1>Violence.</v>

49
00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:40.473
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the exodus of the Armenian </v>

50
00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:42.634
<v Speaker 1>people in Nineteen 15 when hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people were forced to </v>

51
00:02:45.251 --> 00:02:46.084
<v Speaker 1>escape from the Turkish empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a process that became known as the </v>

52
00:02:48.431 --> 00:02:49.264
<v Speaker 1>Armenian genocide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the case would be bass of the </v>

53
00:02:51.011 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of Republicans who </v>
<v Speaker 1>faced the threat of reprisal,</v>

54
00:02:54.311 --> 00:02:55.144
<v Speaker 1>torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and condemnation of all kinds from the </v>

55
00:02:56.891 --> 00:03:00.670
<v Speaker 1>frank [inaudible] and were forced to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave Spain the end of the Spanish civil</v>

56
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.503
<v Speaker 1>war or what happens in the second world </v>
<v Speaker 1>war or with the fight for independence </v>

57
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 1>in African and Asian countries in the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties.</v>

58
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.873
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all times we've had two very clear </v>

59
00:03:11.201 --> 00:03:12.034
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first was a product of the Syrian </v>

60
00:03:13.391 --> 00:03:16.180
<v Speaker 1>civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which since its beginning in 2011,</v>

61
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:20.200
<v Speaker 1>has driven millions of people to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside and outside of its borders.</v>

62
00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:21.093
<v Speaker 1>The second case is that a Venezuelan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then everything indicates that it's </v>

63
00:03:23.921 --> 00:03:28.921
<v Speaker 1>exodus will end up being much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much bigger than serious at this moment.</v>

64
00:03:29.081 --> 00:03:29.914
<v Speaker 1>The migration of Venezuelans should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>described as a forced migration as it's </v>

65
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>not planned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's for survival.</v>

66
00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.053
<v Speaker 1>Beatrice Borgess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>executive director of the Justice and </v>

67
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:41.643
<v Speaker 1>Peace Center in Venezuela because folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to understand what's happening </v>

68
00:03:44.171 --> 00:03:45.004
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>understand that the hundreds of </v>

69
00:03:46.241 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>thousands of Venezuelans who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>escaping,</v>

70
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:50.950
<v Speaker 1>they don't do it for pleasure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do it out of necessity,</v>

71
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.230
<v Speaker 1>and unlike the examples we've covered </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

72
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:54.064
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan exodus isn't the result </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a war or the occupation of a foreign </v>

73
00:03:57.161 --> 00:03:57.994
<v Speaker 1>force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but have the hunger fear and the misery </v>

74
00:04:00.161 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>caused by the Bolivarian Revolution.</v>

75
00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.953
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the mass living condition </v>

76
00:04:07.311 --> 00:04:11.150
<v Speaker 1>survey in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>87 percent of Venezuelans living poverty</v>

77
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:13.940
<v Speaker 1>and more than 60 percent in extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

78
00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:16.630
<v Speaker 1>These are sub Saharan African numbers.</v>

79
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:17.573
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

80
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.543
<v Speaker 1>The paradox is that this humanitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe is happening in one of the </v>

81
00:04:22.371 --> 00:04:24.920
<v Speaker 1>most important oil powers in the world.</v>

82
00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation,</v>

83
00:04:28.551 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 1>it's beginning to get real serious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

84
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:33.680
<v Speaker 1>due to a lack of medicine and health </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment within the country,</v>

85
00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:35.900
<v Speaker 1>diseases such as measles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tuberculosis,</v>

86
00:04:35.901 --> 00:04:36.734
<v Speaker 1>and malaria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diseases that have been eradicated in </v>

87
00:04:38.661 --> 00:04:39.494
<v Speaker 1>the country haven't only reemerged in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some cases they've become real </v>

88
00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>epidemics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends what's more,</v>

89
00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 1>there are more than 100,000 HIV AIDS </v>
<v Speaker 1>patients at risk due to a lack of access</v>

90
00:04:51.441 --> 00:04:52.274
<v Speaker 1>to necessary medication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>United Nations Office for the </v>

91
00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:56.173
<v Speaker 1>Coordination of human affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course this lack of medicine has </v>

92
00:04:58.761 --> 00:05:01.370
<v Speaker 1>lethal consequences for the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not all.</v>

93
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.263
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is experiencing such a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and supply problem that it's </v>

94
00:05:05.871 --> 00:05:09.410
<v Speaker 1>becoming increasingly difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>acquire basic food products.</v>

95
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.273
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the can of tuna can cost more than a </v>

96
00:05:12.021 --> 00:05:15.800
<v Speaker 1>minimum wage salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That athletics explains why according to</v>

97
00:05:15.801 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 1>data from the United Nations where ideas</v>
<v Speaker 1>Datto,</v>

98
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.953
<v Speaker 1>Qbo and the rest of the regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's a growing fat lobster dinners </v>

99
00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:26.180
<v Speaker 1>around one and a half million </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans are currently suffering from</v>

100
00:05:26.181 --> 00:05:31.181
<v Speaker 1>malnutrition and then there's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence issue,</v>

101
00:05:33.321 --> 00:05:36.530
<v Speaker 1>which is also no joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Homicide statistics for example,</v>

102
00:05:36.531 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>are out levels typical of a country in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil war.</v>

103
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:45.520
<v Speaker 1>Check this out and then there's of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course robberies,</v>

104
00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:48.603
<v Speaker 1>losing extortion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all the other crimes that have made </v>

105
00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>this country a very dangerous place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live and the Bolivarian Place.</v>

106
00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 1>They don't help listen</v>

107
00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.120
<v Speaker 3>more than percent</v>

108
00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 1>of the crimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In July,</v>

109
00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:04.030
<v Speaker 1>we're committed by police officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan observatory of violence,</v>

110
00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:04.923
<v Speaker 1>so faced with this scenario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can't be surprised that just in the </v>

111
00:06:07.211 --> 00:06:08.044
<v Speaker 1>last three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2 million Venezuelans have left the </v>

112
00:06:10.031 --> 00:06:12.370
<v Speaker 1>country by sea and land</v>

113
00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:13.333
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

114
00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:20.010
<v Speaker 1>surely you've all seen the huge rows of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans walking step by step towards</v>

115
00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:24.330
<v Speaker 1>the border because most of those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>flee on foot or sometimes take buses,</v>

116
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:25.320
<v Speaker 1>calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mules,</v>

117
00:06:25.321 --> 00:06:28.290
<v Speaker 1>but lately many have begun simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>walking to Columbia,</v>

118
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:29.183
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ecuador first and then maybe from </v>

119
00:06:30.871 --> 00:06:32.970
<v Speaker 1>that of hurry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile or Argentina.</v>

120
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.250
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not an easy trip.</v>

121
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:40.940
<v Speaker 1>The journey is hard not only because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>how tiring it isn't because of what they</v>

122
00:06:40.941 --> 00:06:43.130
<v Speaker 1>leave behind families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends in their homes,</v>

123
00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:43.964
<v Speaker 1>but in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these refugees fall victim to </v>

124
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:48.590
<v Speaker 1>fraudsters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thieves until the nefarious characters.</v>

125
00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:49.453
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other Latin American countries have </v>

126
00:06:51.411 --> 00:06:52.244
<v Speaker 1>shown great solidarity and have allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost unrestricted entry to the </v>

127
00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.860
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

128
00:06:57.890 --> 00:06:58.723
<v Speaker 1>this could all change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Receiving so many people at once isn't </v>

129
00:07:01.041 --> 00:07:01.874
<v Speaker 1>always easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if the recipients on exactly </v>

130
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:08.681
<v Speaker 1>rich countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge pressure</v>

131
00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:15.413
<v Speaker 3>folks.</v>

132
00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:16.283
<v Speaker 1>It's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some Latin American countries are </v>

133
00:07:17.491 --> 00:07:21.360
<v Speaker 1>beginning to feel a lot of pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Venezuelan exodus is so great.</v>

134
00:07:21.361 --> 00:07:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Then in some cases they're facing </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious capacity problems.</v>

135
00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:27.180
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the border stage of Reimer in Brazil,</v>

136
00:07:27.181 --> 00:07:28.014
<v Speaker 1>the number of Venezuelans attending </v>
<v Speaker 1>medical centers has increased from 700 </v>

137
00:07:31.471 --> 00:07:36.471
<v Speaker 1>in 2014 to more than 50,000 in 2017 just</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first three months of 2018.</v>

138
00:07:40.110 --> 00:07:40.943
<v Speaker 1>The number reached over 45,000 every day</v>
<v Speaker 1>around seven to 800 Venezuelans cross </v>

139
00:07:47.221 --> 00:07:48.054
<v Speaker 1>the border and that's creating a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble for their vaccination and </v>

140
00:07:50.521 --> 00:07:52.470
<v Speaker 1>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michel Temer,</v>

141
00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:53.423
<v Speaker 1>president of Brazil in Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of Venezuelans already </v>

142
00:07:56.161 --> 00:07:58.230
<v Speaker 1>exceeds 1 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Peru,</v>

143
00:07:58.231 --> 00:08:02.190
<v Speaker 1>there are more than $400,000 in Ecuador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost a quarter of a million.</v>

144
00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:03.203
<v Speaker 1>The way this is so big that in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far more than 4,000 Venezuelans have </v>

145
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 1>arrived in Ecuador every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

146
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 1>many of them go onto other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like Chile,</v>

147
00:08:12.121 --> 00:08:16.980
<v Speaker 1>which in the first six months between </v>
<v Speaker 1>January and June received almost 150,000</v>

148
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this is causing the most effected</v>

149
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:20.124
<v Speaker 1>countries to begin establishing some </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures to reduce this huge flow of </v>

150
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Brazilian government,</v>

151
00:08:25.751 --> 00:08:26.584
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has announced the deployment of the </v>

152
00:08:27.971 --> 00:08:28.804
<v Speaker 1>military at the border and just stated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it will consider establishing </v>

153
00:08:31.091 --> 00:08:31.924
<v Speaker 1>quotas that is a maximum number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who can enter the country for </v>

154
00:08:34.811 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 1>their past Ecuador and Peru have begun </v>
<v Speaker 1>to demand the presentation of passports.</v>

155
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:40.420
<v Speaker 1>And why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:08:40.421 --> 00:08:41.254
<v Speaker 1>that's because possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly easy to obtain and </v>

157
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Maduro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela because for one,</v>

158
00:08:45.131 --> 00:08:45.964
<v Speaker 1>there's a bureaucratic labyrinth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also the simple facts that the </v>

159
00:08:48.071 --> 00:08:50.470
<v Speaker 1>government lacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The paper needed to actually print.</v>

160
00:08:52.730 --> 00:08:53.563
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's little say the Fang </v>

161
00:08:54.161 --> 00:08:54.994
<v Speaker 1>that because many officials do great </v>
<v Speaker 1>business by selling possibles on the </v>

162
00:08:57.571 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>black market where a simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities,</v>

163
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:00.503
<v Speaker 1>official price is only about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of twenty cents can cost </v>

164
00:09:03.121 --> 00:09:03.954
<v Speaker 1>between $705,500 depending on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>quickly you need us or how much money </v>

165
00:09:09.931 --> 00:09:10.764
<v Speaker 1>the buyer has</v>

166
00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 4>the new face or face to own new.</v>

167
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:22.270
<v Speaker 1>And for those who are lucky enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>already have a passport when it expires,</v>

168
00:09:22.271 --> 00:09:23.104
<v Speaker 1>they can extend its validity for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>more years with a stamp because they </v>

169
00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:28.090
<v Speaker 1>won't get another passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even so,</v>

170
00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.550
<v Speaker 1>getting that stamp,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you go through the black market,</v>

171
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:32.290
<v Speaker 1>can take up to three months</v>

172
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.503
<v Speaker 4>chocolate</v>

173
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.723
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the way things are for the first </v>

174
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:43.974
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last in America is facing a serious </v>

175
00:09:45.271 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 1>problem with its borders and it's not an</v>
<v Speaker 1>easy problem.</v>

176
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:48.383
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't prevent Venezuelans from </v>

177
00:09:50.161 --> 00:09:50.994
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a humanitarian issue and there's </v>

178
00:09:52.410 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>still a huge margin of refugees to </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

179
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:57.600
<v Speaker 1>but it's evidence that if things go on </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

180
00:09:57.601 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 1>more and more people will try to escape </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

181
00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.283
<v Speaker 1>And that's quite a challenge here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every Latin American country needs to </v>

182
00:10:04.321 --> 00:10:05.154
<v Speaker 1>work in a coordinated manner and receive</v>
<v Speaker 1>support from the international </v>

183
00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.150
<v Speaker 1>community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

184
00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.043
<v Speaker 1>to be fatty acid and solidarity shown by</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the regions countries has been </v>

185
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:14.094
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's been an incredible example of that </v>

186
00:10:16.341 --> 00:10:17.400
<v Speaker 1>in unity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>

187
00:10:17.401 --> 00:10:18.234
<v Speaker 1>one final note here isn't really common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans who were leaving in recent </v>

188
00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.343
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many Venezuelans who made a fortune </v>

189
00:10:23.281 --> 00:10:24.114
<v Speaker 1>during the bolivarian revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dark period as well as the families of </v>

190
00:10:26.821 --> 00:10:29.160
<v Speaker 1>many high ranking officials if also </v>
<v Speaker 1>left,</v>

191
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:31.050
<v Speaker 1>and of course they've done it with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>full wallet.</v>

192
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:36.920
<v Speaker 1>Former ministers of Chavez hit 2 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>euros and on Dora the opulent landing of</v>

193
00:10:39.001 --> 00:10:39.834
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan millionaires in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a dozen businessman and former top </v>

194
00:10:43.531 --> 00:10:46.230
<v Speaker 1>officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of them detained for corruption,</v>

195
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:51.090
<v Speaker 1>have invested tens of millions in luxury</v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate and hunting ranches.</v>

196
00:10:51.150 --> 00:10:51.983
<v Speaker 1>These are known as Bala Chicos and we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try and do a video about them </v>

197
00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:56.310
<v Speaker 1>in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now it's your turn.</v>

198
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:57.144
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>community should help the Venezuelan </v>

199
00:10:59.401 --> 00:11:00.600
<v Speaker 1>people more?</v>
