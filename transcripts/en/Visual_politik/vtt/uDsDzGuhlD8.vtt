00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.610
<v Speaker 2>Pearson is kind of like your boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't like him,</v>

3
00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.260
<v Speaker 2>you don't trust him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But yeah,</v>

4
00:00:12.261 --> 00:00:14.960
<v Speaker 2>absolutely do need him to pay your </v>
<v Speaker 2>bills.</v>

5
00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.853
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's been a long time since we talked </v>

6
00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:20.510
<v Speaker 2>about Putin here on visual politic and I</v>
<v Speaker 2>know what you're thinking now.</v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:24.750
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

8
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon,</v>

9
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:29.210
<v Speaker 2>and we rarely gonna talk about oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean do it to death.</v>

10
00:00:29.211 --> 00:00:30.044
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well actually this time we're not </v>

11
00:00:31.941 --> 00:00:33.440
<v Speaker 2>talking about oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

12
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.110
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

13
00:00:36.111 --> 00:00:36.944
<v Speaker 2>many of you might think that these are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually very similar things because at </v>

14
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:42.320
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries with oil reserves usually have</v>

15
00:00:42.321 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 2>gas reserves too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a difference.</v>

16
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 2>Oil markets are way more diversified.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

17
00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.620
<v Speaker 2>Europe obeys 30% of their crude oil from</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia,</v>

18
00:00:51.621 --> 00:00:52.454
<v Speaker 2>but when it comes to the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then number rises to 40% but if we look </v>

19
00:00:56.121 --> 00:00:59.690
<v Speaker 2>at each individual European country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dependency is way higher.</v>

20
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:00.583
<v Speaker 2>Germany imports 60% of their gas from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and other countries like Finland </v>

21
00:01:03.831 --> 00:01:06.560
<v Speaker 2>in the Baltics depends entirely on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian gas.</v>

22
00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.633
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin could leave these countries </v>

23
00:01:09.141 --> 00:01:11.570
<v Speaker 2>freezing on a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cold wind tonight.</v>

24
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.130
<v Speaker 2>That would honestly make game of thrones</v>
<v Speaker 2>look kind of like Baywatch.</v>

25
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.313
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a minute here because there's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more to this resource than heating in </v>

26
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.124
<v Speaker 2>facts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need natural gas for many of the </v>

27
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:29.310
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

28
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 2>domestic and assumption is just a third </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the</v>

29
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.243
<v Speaker 1>total</v>

30
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:37.363
<v Speaker 2>as you can see on this chart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another third is for thermal power </v>

31
00:01:39.771 --> 00:01:42.980
<v Speaker 2>plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the biggest share is used by various</v>

32
00:01:42.981 --> 00:01:44.240
<v Speaker 2>industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

33
00:01:44.241 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 2>a paper manufacturing company needs </v>
<v Speaker 2>thermal energy.</v>

34
00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.670
<v Speaker 2>This means heat in order to get this </v>
<v Speaker 2>eat.</v>

35
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 2>The factory uses gas and the same goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>for many,</v>

36
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.490
<v Speaker 2>many other industries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

37
00:01:55.491 --> 00:02:00.491
<v Speaker 2>gas is extremely important to everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that includes Europe and now can you</v>

38
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.920
<v Speaker 2>guess who is the biggest consumer of gas</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all of Europe?</v>

39
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.260
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that would be Germany,</v>

40
00:02:06.261 --> 00:02:07.094
<v Speaker 2>the most populous country on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>continent and also the one with the </v>

41
00:02:09.501 --> 00:02:13.940
<v Speaker 2>largest economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is the key to our story because</v>

42
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:17.060
<v Speaker 2>as long as Germany remains so dependent </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Russia,</v>

43
00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.060
<v Speaker 2>all of Europe is going to depend on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia too.</v>

44
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300
<v Speaker 2>And this is why during the 2018 NATO </v>
<v Speaker 2>summit,</v>

45
00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.360
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump said things like this,</v>

46
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.480
<v Speaker 3>Germany is totally controlled by Russia </v>
<v Speaker 3>because they were getting from 60 to 70%</v>

47
00:02:31.551 --> 00:02:34.760
<v Speaker 3>of their energy from Russia and a new </v>
<v Speaker 3>pipeline,</v>

48
00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.420
<v Speaker 3>and you'd tell me if that's appropriate </v>
<v Speaker 3>because I think it's not then.</v>

49
00:02:38.421 --> 00:02:39.980
<v Speaker 3>I think it's a very bad thing for NATO.</v>

50
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so the question today is trump,</v>

51
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:43.174
<v Speaker 2>right when he criticizes Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is it really a problem that Germany has </v>

52
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:50.650
<v Speaker 2>such a high dependency on Russian gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>and more importantly,</v>

53
00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:54.040
<v Speaker 2>is there a true attempt to reduce that </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependency?</v>

54
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we're going to answer all of those</v>

55
00:02:56.111 --> 00:02:57.580
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as always,</v>

56
00:02:57.581 --> 00:03:00.580
<v Speaker 2>before we do last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take a look back at the history</v>

57
00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.460
<v Speaker 2>man in Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are two ways of transporting gas.</v>

58
00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:11.294
<v Speaker 2>The cheapest one is through a pipeline.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means we build a huge pipe that </v>

59
00:03:14.511 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 2>goes from the place we take the gas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see the Yamal peninsula in Russia to the</v>

60
00:03:18.921 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 2>country that buys it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

61
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:22.880
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is very cheap because,</v>

62
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.730
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just need to build the pipelines.</v>

63
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.080
<v Speaker 2>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's no need for trucks.</v>

64
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:28.580
<v Speaker 2>There's no need for ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

65
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.653
<v Speaker 2>nothing like that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since you transport the gas through the </v>

66
00:03:31.731 --> 00:03:33.530
<v Speaker 2>pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it comes to the power plants,</v>

67
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.500
<v Speaker 2>the houses and the factories all </v>
<v Speaker 2>directly.</v>

68
00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.510
<v Speaker 2>There is also an alternative method </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

69
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:43.090
<v Speaker 2>and that's so called liquified natural </v>
<v Speaker 2>gas or l and g.</v>

70
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 2>So how does this work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

71
00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:52.950
<v Speaker 2>let's say we take our guests from </v>
<v Speaker 2>cutoff.</v>

72
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.300
<v Speaker 2>What we do is we lowered its temperature</v>
<v Speaker 2>until it's 161 Celsius below zero.</v>

73
00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.410
<v Speaker 2>This is the point when the gas becomes </v>
<v Speaker 2>liquid and you can store it in bottles.</v>

74
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.303
<v Speaker 2>These bottles can then be stored on a </v>
<v Speaker 2>ship and sent to say Barcelona in Spain </v>

75
00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:09.463
<v Speaker 2>there they have a regassification plants</v>
<v Speaker 2>where they heat to the liquid until it </v>

76
00:04:12.171 --> 00:04:13.004
<v Speaker 2>becomes gas again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The gas thing goes to the national pipe </v>

77
00:04:14.961 --> 00:04:15.794
<v Speaker 2>network and that's when it's transported</v>
<v Speaker 2>to houses and factories and things like </v>

78
00:04:19.311 --> 00:04:22.550
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what's the advantage of this process?</v>

79
00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:23.413
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it allows Europe to diversify their gas </v>

80
00:04:25.371 --> 00:04:27.440
<v Speaker 2>providers easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But what's the problem?</v>

81
00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 2>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's 50 to 70% more expensive than using</v>

82
00:04:30.861 --> 00:04:32.690
<v Speaker 2>those pipelines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We mentioned previously,</v>

83
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.200
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why European countries buy their</v>

84
00:04:36.201 --> 00:04:39.770
<v Speaker 2>gas from the closest to producers that </v>
<v Speaker 2>were using pipelines.</v>

85
00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:40.693
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the biggest supplier of Spain is </v>

86
00:04:41.931 --> 00:04:43.700
<v Speaker 2>Algeria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the northern countries,</v>

87
00:04:43.701 --> 00:04:46.640
<v Speaker 2>they buy gas from Norway and especially </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

88
00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 2>As we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like rough snaps or luke,</v>

89
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:53.760
<v Speaker 2>I'll export more than half of the gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>consumed in Germany and this,</v>

90
00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:54.633
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the country is located </v>

91
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 2>between Germany and Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

92
00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.490
<v Speaker 2>they haven't even deeper dependency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just have a look at this.</v>

93
00:05:00.491 --> 00:05:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

94
00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:01.713
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

95
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Pay Attention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'll see how Poland depends on Russian</v>

96
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.160
<v Speaker 2>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The 75% of its needs.</v>

97
00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.260
<v Speaker 2>Other countries like Finland is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Romania.</v>

98
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 2>They go all the way up to 100%.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

99
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.940
<v Speaker 2>half of Europe needs Russia in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>simply survive,</v>

100
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 2>and this is no secret.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The European Commission,</v>

101
00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.570
<v Speaker 2>they know about it and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Putin knows about it too.</v>

102
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.873
<v Speaker 3>Germany will become totally dependent on</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russian energy if it does not </v>

103
00:05:34.221 --> 00:05:39.221
<v Speaker 3>immediately change course.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here in the Western Hemisphere.</v>

104
00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.443
<v Speaker 3>We are committed to maintaining our </v>
<v Speaker 3>independence from the encroachment of </v>

105
00:05:47.811 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 3>expansionist foreign powers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But</v>

106
00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.420
<v Speaker 2>let's pause the video here for just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>moment.</v>

107
00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.150
<v Speaker 2>Right here we can see the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>delegation laughing at trump.</v>

108
00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 2>He just said that will become totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependent on Russian energy.</v>

109
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:02.340
<v Speaker 2>This means if they were already </v>
<v Speaker 2>dependence,</v>

110
00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 2>they will become even more dependence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is he talking about exactly?</v>

111
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.570
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's rewind the video.</v>

112
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.560
<v Speaker 2>Remember this name?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gerhard schrader.</v>

113
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:24.680
<v Speaker 2>Here's the former German chancellor,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the predessessors of Angela Merkel.</v>

114
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.633
<v Speaker 2>He still maintains a massive influence </v>
<v Speaker 2>in German and European politics and </v>

115
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:31.430
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what does he do now?</v>

116
00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:33.490
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually he's building v</v>

117
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.660
<v Speaker 1>former,</v>

118
00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:41.320
<v Speaker 2>no chief rest Mohsen Germany walks into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin's trap,</v>

119
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.610
<v Speaker 2>Nord Stream two basically Nord stream </v>
<v Speaker 2>two is a brand new pipeline,</v>

120
00:06:45.611 --> 00:06:46.444
<v Speaker 2>but we're to go under the Baltic Sea </v>
<v Speaker 2>connecting Germany with Russia with no </v>

121
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:50.284
<v Speaker 2>middle man with this new pipeline,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany could double the import of </v>

122
00:06:52.841 --> 00:06:53.674
<v Speaker 2>Russian gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since this project has a shareholder </v>

123
00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.100
<v Speaker 2>committee with companies like the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian giant Gazprom and the presidents</v>

124
00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:02.590
<v Speaker 2>of this committee is of course Mr. </v>
<v Speaker 2>Schroeder.</v>

125
00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:05.200
<v Speaker 2>If this isn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The former German chancellor is also the</v>

126
00:07:05.201 --> 00:07:07.680
<v Speaker 2>president of Ross.</v>
<v Speaker 2>NAFSA rational.</v>

127
00:07:07.681 --> 00:07:12.681
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is wine.</v>

128
00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:14.803
<v Speaker 2>The last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Schroeder has become Putin's man in </v>

129
00:07:17.181 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

130
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:19.063
<v Speaker 2>he has defended Russia in all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>matters from the cyber attacks against </v>

131
00:07:22.581 --> 00:07:25.220
<v Speaker 2>the Estonian governments do the Crimean </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasion.</v>

132
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:26.233
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far from reducing that dependence on </v>

133
00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:28.934
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany is giving him the opposite </v>

134
00:07:30.471 --> 00:07:31.304
<v Speaker 2>direction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what were those Germans laughing </v>

135
00:07:33.021 --> 00:07:34.730
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

136
00:07:35.090 --> 00:07:37.010
<v Speaker 2>I don't have any idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all right.</v>

137
00:07:37.011 --> 00:07:38.570
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you're thinking right now.</v>

138
00:07:38.571 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 2>What was the problem with depends on </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite so much on Russia.</v>

139
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 2>Maybe it's because Putin's an </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian ruler,</v>

140
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:49.683
<v Speaker 2>but seriously it's not because if that </v>
<v Speaker 2>was the case or where else would we buy </v>

141
00:07:53.111 --> 00:07:53.944
<v Speaker 2>gas from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean the other list of suppliers </v>

142
00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.030
<v Speaker 2>includes as a [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>Algeria and Qatar,</v>

143
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.983
<v Speaker 2>which of course we all know a healthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy is governed by wonderful </v>

144
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:04.340
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bullock.</v>

145
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.253
<v Speaker 2>The reality is no one really gives a </v>
<v Speaker 2>shit about democracy and human rights </v>

146
00:08:07.331 --> 00:08:09.030
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to having heating in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

147
00:08:09.250 --> 00:08:10.083
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the problem with defending on Russia is </v>

148
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:14.550
<v Speaker 2>something else and that's something </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to understand right now.</v>

149
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.653
<v Speaker 2>Russia holics in Leah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2006 Gazprom ones at the Ukrainians to </v>

150
00:08:23.261 --> 00:08:24.094
<v Speaker 2>pay six times more for gas in.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a 100% political move for </v>

151
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:29.434
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and Ukraine had this really good </v>

152
00:08:30.581 --> 00:08:31.414
<v Speaker 2>relationship and then the orange </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution began when Victor Yushchenko </v>

153
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:37.960
<v Speaker 2>came to power with his auntie Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and pro European rhetoric.</v>

154
00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Speaker 2>The Kremlin essentially said this or I </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine.</v>

155
00:08:41.530 --> 00:08:42.940
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to go and hang out with your</v>

156
00:08:42.941 --> 00:08:44.740
<v Speaker 2>cool European friends and forget about </v>
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>

157
00:08:44.741 --> 00:08:48.960
<v Speaker 2>well get your wallet out because it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be expensive.</v>

158
00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:49.883
<v Speaker 2>I think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Building a brand new pipeline with </v>

159
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:53.230
<v Speaker 2>another country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it takes years,</v>

160
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:54.093
<v Speaker 2>so Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just couldn't find a new supplier </v>

161
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:59.340
<v Speaker 2>overnight if booths in one sense,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he could raise prices at well,</v>

162
00:08:59.341 --> 00:09:00.174
<v Speaker 2>men's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you crane doesn't want to pay us </v>

163
00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia or we'll just close the pipe</v>

164
00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:10.040
<v Speaker 4>for three days in the middle of a cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>wave,</v>

165
00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:14.090
<v Speaker 4>Ukrainians had no heating at home and </v>
<v Speaker 4>after a tense negotiation,</v>

166
00:09:14.150 --> 00:09:19.150
<v Speaker 4>Ukraine agreed to pay double for the gas</v>
<v Speaker 4>exchange.</v>

167
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:26.990
<v Speaker 4>It raised the fee that Russia had to pay</v>
<v Speaker 4>in order to cross the country,</v>

168
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:30.150
<v Speaker 2>transport the gas to the rest of Europe </v>
<v Speaker 2>bus.</v>

169
00:09:30.180 --> 00:09:34.020
<v Speaker 2>This was just the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the year 2009 we had the same problem</v>

170
00:09:34.290 --> 00:09:35.123
<v Speaker 2>but rather king sized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia wanted Ukraine to pay more for </v>

171
00:09:38.191 --> 00:09:39.300
<v Speaker 2>their gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once again,</v>

172
00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:40.223
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Moscow started insulting each </v>
<v Speaker 2>other and in this case it was not only </v>

173
00:09:43.561 --> 00:09:45.420
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the one without gas for days,</v>

174
00:09:45.421 --> 00:09:48.690
<v Speaker 2>it was also the rest of Europe and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>included the Czech Republic,</v>

175
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:51.600
<v Speaker 2>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poland's and of course Germany.</v>

176
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.670
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dear us,</v>

177
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:54.840
<v Speaker 2>most of that Russian gas comes through </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine,</v>

178
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:55.674
<v Speaker 2>so if Ukrainians have no gas to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Johnson's are other Europeans are going </v>

179
00:09:58.411 --> 00:10:00.000
<v Speaker 2>to be freezing too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

180
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:00.834
<v Speaker 2>the story ends with Ukraine paying more </v>
<v Speaker 2>for their gas in exchange for more </v>

181
00:10:03.811 --> 00:10:05.760
<v Speaker 2>transport fees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

182
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:06.623
<v Speaker 2>just like game of thrones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin's tune is a song of ice and fire </v>

183
00:10:10.710 --> 00:10:11.543
<v Speaker 2>after freezing Europeans in 2006 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>2009 2014 when it was the year of fire </v>

184
00:10:17.010 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 2>and the fire came in a Ukrainian </v>
<v Speaker 2>province,</v>

185
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:20.520
<v Speaker 2>core Crimea</v>

186
00:10:24.830 --> 00:10:25.663
<v Speaker 2>because as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russians took it and so what did the </v>

187
00:10:29.570 --> 00:10:30.800
<v Speaker 2>European Union doing this case?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

188
00:10:30.801 --> 00:10:32.690
<v Speaker 2>they just came to Peterson and </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially said,</v>

189
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>who's in your very naughty boy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to sanction you.</v>

190
00:10:35.511 --> 00:10:37.790
<v Speaker 2>When do you all write these lines?</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 Times over?</v>

191
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:41.210
<v Speaker 2>I will not invade other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will not invade other countries.</v>

192
00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:42.044
<v Speaker 2>I will not invade other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now Ukraine is more of a headache than </v>

193
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:46.514
<v Speaker 2>anything else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's something we're going to </v>

194
00:10:47.511 --> 00:10:50.990
<v Speaker 2>cover in the next video of this series </v>
<v Speaker 2>because yes,</v>

195
00:10:50.991 --> 00:10:53.780
<v Speaker 2>we all doing a series all about Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>gas.</v>

196
00:10:53.781 --> 00:10:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And if you don't want to miss it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you know what to do this,</v>

197
00:10:56.181 --> 00:10:58.730
<v Speaker 2>this of dry and below in a ballad,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do your thing.</v>

198
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:01.640
<v Speaker 2>So now Europe has two options.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin,</v>

199
00:11:01.641 --> 00:11:02.474
<v Speaker 2>Andy Schrader,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they want to build new pipelines to </v>

200
00:11:03.861 --> 00:11:06.620
<v Speaker 2>bypass Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the first option.</v>

201
00:11:06.770 --> 00:11:07.603
<v Speaker 2>The second one is what the European </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union once and that's defined other gas </v>

202
00:11:11.211 --> 00:11:12.800
<v Speaker 2>suppliers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>

203
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.693
<v Speaker 2>can they really do that now pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention because we're going to answer </v>

204
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:21.101
<v Speaker 2>that question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Attempts to diversify.</v>

205
00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:26.860
<v Speaker 2>The fastest way of diversifying is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you guessed it,</v>

206
00:11:26.890 --> 00:11:30.100
<v Speaker 2>buying liquefied natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it is expensive,</v>

207
00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:33.220
<v Speaker 2>but countries do not need to wait to </v>
<v Speaker 2>build new pipelines.</v>

208
00:11:33.250 --> 00:11:34.690
<v Speaker 2>So what's the problem there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

209
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.270
<v Speaker 2>LNG ships are too busy with the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 2>market,</v>

210
00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 1>basically.</v>

211
00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.060
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Pacific Ocean is full of these ships</v>

212
00:11:46.061 --> 00:11:48.010
<v Speaker 2>that can go from Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Qatar,</v>

213
00:11:48.190 --> 00:11:50.290
<v Speaker 2>and to Malaysia to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

214
00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.690
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

215
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.523
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

216
00:11:55.580 --> 00:11:56.413
<v Speaker 2>You see in Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas prices are higher than anywhere </v>

217
00:11:58.131 --> 00:11:58.964
<v Speaker 2>else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So Good Luck convincing America rock </v>

218
00:12:00.471 --> 00:12:01.304
<v Speaker 2>guitar to sell you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then natural gas when they're getting </v>

219
00:12:03.381 --> 00:12:06.500
<v Speaker 2>rich off Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why the most realistic option is</v>

220
00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:09.080
<v Speaker 2>to build new pipelines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is though,</v>

221
00:12:09.530 --> 00:12:10.363
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

222
00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.370
<v Speaker 2>so on the one hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no way.</v>

223
00:12:20.371 --> 00:12:23.450
<v Speaker 2>This Europe already buys all of the gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>they produce.</v>

224
00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.313
<v Speaker 2>Going south,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have Spain who wants to build the </v>

225
00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:29.450
<v Speaker 2>midcap pipeline that would connect to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Algeria with northern Europe,</v>

226
00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:30.313
<v Speaker 2>but France is not very excited about the</v>
<v Speaker 2>idea because that would mean they have </v>

227
00:12:33.051 --> 00:12:35.990
<v Speaker 2>to build the whole that in order to sell</v>
<v Speaker 2>to other countries.</v>

228
00:12:36.290 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

229
00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:39.770
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh man,</v>

230
00:12:39.771 --> 00:12:44.510
<v Speaker 2>this is so much walk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe tomorrow or maybe never.</v>

231
00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:45.921
<v Speaker 2>Maybe never.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Never.</v>

232
00:12:45.921 --> 00:12:47.120
<v Speaker 2>Sounds good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

233
00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:47.954
<v Speaker 2>So then we have serious alternative so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far as the so called Trans Adriatic </v>

234
00:12:51.021 --> 00:12:54.740
<v Speaker 2>pipeline or tap.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is meant to be finished by 2020.</v>

235
00:12:54.890 --> 00:12:58.610
<v Speaker 2>This pipeline goes from Azerbaijan </v>
<v Speaker 2>crosses Turkey and goes all the way into</v>

236
00:12:58.611 --> 00:12:59.930
<v Speaker 2>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But wait a minute,</v>

237
00:12:59.931 --> 00:13:00.764
<v Speaker 2>because this still is not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This pipeline has a maximum capacity of </v>

238
00:13:04.041 --> 00:13:04.874
<v Speaker 2>20 billion cubic meters of gas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't even a half the capacity of </v>

239
00:13:08.331 --> 00:13:11.480
<v Speaker 2>the Nord Stream two that connects </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and Russia.</v>

240
00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:14.180
<v Speaker 2>But this is not the only problem when it</v>
<v Speaker 2>comes to oil.</v>

241
00:13:14.181 --> 00:13:15.014
<v Speaker 2>Putin is a fairy jealous boyfriends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you thought he would put up with </v>

242
00:13:18.951 --> 00:13:22.420
<v Speaker 2>so much gas promiscuity when you're very</v>
<v Speaker 2>wrong.</v>

243
00:13:26.210 --> 00:13:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Gas</v>

244
00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.713
<v Speaker 2>promises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gas transit via Ukraine to Europe may </v>

245
00:13:30.361 --> 00:13:33.960
<v Speaker 2>fall to 10 to 15 billion cubic meters </v>
<v Speaker 2>per year.</v>

246
00:13:34.230 --> 00:13:37.170
<v Speaker 2>With this move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin kills two birds with one stone.</v>

247
00:13:37.171 --> 00:13:41.340
<v Speaker 2>Firsties forcing Europe to follow him </v>
<v Speaker 2>and on top of that he bypasses Ukraine.</v>

248
00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:44.250
<v Speaker 2>But this is not the end of the story </v>
<v Speaker 2>here in the south.</v>

249
00:13:44.251 --> 00:13:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Putin is also pushing to build brand new</v>
<v Speaker 2>pipes.</v>

250
00:13:46.870 --> 00:13:47.703
<v Speaker 2>And yesterday if it was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you thought Gerhard Schroeder is the </v>

251
00:13:50.431 --> 00:13:54.160
<v Speaker 2>only friend of Vladimir Putin in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well you're all very,</v>

252
00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:54.690
<v Speaker 2>very good.</v>

253
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:58.980
<v Speaker 1>Rome hungry</v>

254
00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:03.380
<v Speaker 2>once Russia's Turkish stream pipeline to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be extended into Europe.</v>

255
00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.410
<v Speaker 2>But still there are two points we </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't dealt with her for one,</v>

256
00:14:06.411 --> 00:14:07.244
<v Speaker 2>we have to talk about Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can Putin totally bypass them on top of </v>

257
00:14:10.551 --> 00:14:11.384
<v Speaker 2>that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should definitely talk about as a </v>

258
00:14:12.171 --> 00:14:15.530
<v Speaker 2>budget on another dictatorship that will</v>
<v Speaker 2>become Europe's best friend.</v>

259
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.480
<v Speaker 2>So if you don't want to miss those </v>

<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

261
00:14:20.210 --> 00:14:21.043
<v Speaker 2>I've got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Putin can reduce its </v>

262
00:14:22.851 --> 00:14:23.684
<v Speaker 2>dependency on Russia or do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin will become the night king with </v>

263
00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:30.350
<v Speaker 2>enough power to turn Europeans into </v>
<v Speaker 2>white walkers?</v>
