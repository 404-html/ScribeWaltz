1
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.210
<v Speaker 1>Aw,</v>

2
00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 2>Germany is the place where BMW Rammstein</v>
<v Speaker 2>and FK.</v>

3
00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 2>That's nudist culture were born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Gemini has something even more important</v>

5
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:21.184
<v Speaker 2>than all of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that is the fact that it is the </v>

6
00:00:23.681 --> 00:00:25.750
<v Speaker 2>world's ultimate factory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

7
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:26.613
<v Speaker 2>You heard that rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I can guess what you're probably </v>

8
00:00:27.911 --> 00:00:29.170
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute,</v>

9
00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:31.930
<v Speaker 2>Simon isn't shiner the country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You are a TV screens,</v>

10
00:00:31.931 --> 00:00:32.764
<v Speaker 2>mobile phones as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Practically every good under the sun is </v>

11
00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:36.004
<v Speaker 2>made.</v>

12
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:40.913
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

13
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:45.150
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that's not entirely true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now of course China does lead the charge</v>

14
00:00:45.151 --> 00:00:47.430
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to exports,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do you know wasp,</v>

15
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.710
<v Speaker 2>in order to manufacture all of those </v>
<v Speaker 2>products,</v>

16
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:52.890
<v Speaker 2>they need to import a lot of things from</v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>

17
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Germany in standard sells way more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>what it binds.</v>

18
00:00:56.311 --> 00:00:57.144
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one out of every 10 product sold on the </v>

19
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:01.170
<v Speaker 2>international market is made in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

20
00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.540
<v Speaker 2>which has a population 15 times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's smaller than sure</v>

21
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.413
<v Speaker 1>why now.</v>

22
00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.073
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all know those big German car </v>

23
00:01:10.161 --> 00:01:11.870
<v Speaker 2>companies like BMW,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Audi,</v>

24
00:01:11.871 --> 00:01:15.260
<v Speaker 2>or Volkswagen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But that is way more than that.</v>

25
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.220
<v Speaker 2>If you don't believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

26
00:01:16.221 --> 00:01:18.380
<v Speaker 2>just consider your mobile phone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I know,</v>

27
00:01:18.381 --> 00:01:21.290
<v Speaker 2>I know on the back is going to say </v>
<v Speaker 2>something like assembled in the People's</v>

28
00:01:21.291 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Republic of China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm not talking about this.</v>

29
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.663
<v Speaker 2>I'm talking about if you open up that </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone that you're going to find a bunch </v>

30
00:01:28.641 --> 00:01:29.474
<v Speaker 2>of microchips insight as an example here</v>
<v Speaker 2>of that chip that makes your phone till </v>

31
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:34.610
<v Speaker 2>you know when you rotate it in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen matches up.</v>

32
00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.563
<v Speaker 2>Vance probably most likely made by a </v>
<v Speaker 2>German company called Bosch Sensor </v>

33
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:40.010
<v Speaker 2>attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only that,</v>

34
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.873
<v Speaker 2>many of the robots is instilling these </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese factories assembling these </v>

35
00:01:43.641 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>phones are probably made in Germany.</v>

36
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Germany,</v>

37
00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:53.334
<v Speaker 2>they manufacture the things that go </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of other things that are </v>

38
00:01:55.321 --> 00:01:56.154
<v Speaker 2>manufactured by things that are made in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and now you might be wondering </v>

39
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.770
<v Speaker 2>how is any of that possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean factories,</v>

40
00:02:01.771 --> 00:02:03.990
<v Speaker 2>they should be built in places with </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheap labor costs,</v>

41
00:02:03.991 --> 00:02:04.830
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

42
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:05.723
<v Speaker 2>how is it possible Germany with </v>
<v Speaker 2>relatively high salaries is such an </v>

43
00:02:08.821 --> 00:02:10.400
<v Speaker 2>industrial powerhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

44
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.960
<v Speaker 2>the good news is that today we're going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to answer that question for you,</v>

45
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 2>but as always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>before we get into all of that,</v>

46
00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

47
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 2>Liberalism offset wells was it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe was pretty done,</v>

49
00:02:27.861 --> 00:02:29.330
<v Speaker 2>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Countries like Italy,</v>

50
00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:30.590
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>western Germany,</v>

51
00:02:30.591 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 2>which was the capitalist side of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

52
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.600
<v Speaker 2>They got a massive money groans from </v>
<v Speaker 2>their good friends.</v>

53
00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:40.601
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Sam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait just a minute because each of these</v>

54
00:02:41.051 --> 00:02:43.990
<v Speaker 2>countries use that money in totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different ways.</v>

55
00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.500
<v Speaker 2>The French president for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's this guy that you'd see on tv?</v>

56
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.090
<v Speaker 2>Generally Joe's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go.</v>

57
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.390
<v Speaker 2>It all came from the military who was no</v>
<v Speaker 2>friend of private companies is political</v>

58
00:02:56.391 --> 00:02:57.224
<v Speaker 2>creed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The so called dirtied sma was </v>

59
00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.063
<v Speaker 2>nationalizing big businesses and leading</v>
<v Speaker 2>the whole country's economy as if it </v>

60
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:03.570
<v Speaker 2>wasn't</v>

61
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.403
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

62
00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.030
<v Speaker 2>They chose a totally different path.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both the Chancellor Conrad,</v>

63
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 2>either an hour and his finance minister </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ludvig Ah,</v>

64
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.790
<v Speaker 2>heart spent years thinking about that </v>
<v Speaker 2>new and economic system.</v>

65
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.170
<v Speaker 2>It was a mixture between the composition</v>
<v Speaker 2>of free market capitalism and the safety</v>

66
00:03:22.171 --> 00:03:23.004
<v Speaker 2>nets provided by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They then decided to give this system </v>

67
00:03:25.711 --> 00:03:26.544
<v Speaker 2>what is probably the worst name in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world ever be called it auto liberalism </v>

68
00:03:29.671 --> 00:03:30.720
<v Speaker 2>or social marketing.</v>

69
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:31.753
<v Speaker 1>Honami</v>

70
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.323
<v Speaker 2>addition is the most promising means to </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieve and secure prosperity nude vic </v>

71
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.100
<v Speaker 2>Elford and other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the goal centralize the economy in</v>

72
00:03:41.101 --> 00:03:41.970
<v Speaker 2>Paris.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Conrad,</v>

73
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.400
<v Speaker 2>I don't know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I designed a system where the government</v>

74
00:03:44.401 --> 00:03:45.234
<v Speaker 2>would put into place a set of conditions</v>
<v Speaker 2>that the other players would make that </v>

75
00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.970
<v Speaker 2>own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This explains why in Germany,</v>

76
00:03:50.971 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 2>trade unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>regional governments,</v>

77
00:03:52.771 --> 00:03:55.100
<v Speaker 2>and of course companies are quite too </v>
<v Speaker 2>important.</v>

78
00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:01.243
<v Speaker 2>Didn't say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might be wondering what are the </v>

79
00:04:01.731 --> 00:04:05.150
<v Speaker 2>keys that are needed for a system like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this to work and well,</v>

80
00:04:05.151 --> 00:04:06.430
<v Speaker 2>has it really worked out?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's all,</v>

81
00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.333
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get right into that stable </v>

82
00:04:11.181 --> 00:04:13.490
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure at some point you've had</v>

83
00:04:13.491 --> 00:04:17.180
<v Speaker 2>some economists saying that devaluing </v>
<v Speaker 2>your currency boosts Zach Sports,</v>

84
00:04:17.181 --> 00:04:18.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

85
00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:21.920
<v Speaker 2>imagine we have a shoe manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 2>facility in Mexico and we want to sell a</v>

86
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:25.640
<v Speaker 2>pair of shoes to the American market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the price of the shoes is 2000</v>

87
00:04:25.641 --> 00:04:28.220
<v Speaker 2>and Mexican pesos at the time and making</v>
<v Speaker 2>this video,</v>

88
00:04:28.221 --> 00:04:31.940
<v Speaker 2>those 2000 pesos is equal to about 110 </v>
<v Speaker 2>US dollars.</v>

89
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.733
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexican central bank decides to print </v>

90
00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 2>money and therefore devalue its currency</v>
<v Speaker 2>from one day to the next.</v>

91
00:04:40.801 --> 00:04:43.290
<v Speaker 2>The pair of shoes could be worth 90 US </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollars.</v>

92
00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.153
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it'd be easier to sell these shoes </v>

93
00:04:45.391 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

94
00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.273
<v Speaker 2>this is a theory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually supported by most </v>

95
00:04:48.961 --> 00:04:50.520
<v Speaker 2>governments today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the Germans,</v>

96
00:04:50.521 --> 00:04:51.354
<v Speaker 2>they actually decided to do the exact </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposites and for the later part of the </v>

97
00:04:53.941 --> 00:04:54.774
<v Speaker 2>20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the German mark was actually one of the </v>

98
00:04:56.611 --> 00:04:59.060
<v Speaker 2>most stable currencies in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>

99
00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.913
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

100
00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.880
<v Speaker 2>This might lead you to one's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

101
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:07.800
<v Speaker 2>How is it possible that Germany could </v>
<v Speaker 2>export so much when their products,</v>

102
00:05:07.801 --> 00:05:09.730
<v Speaker 2>what not actually that sheep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

103
00:05:09.731 --> 00:05:10.564
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's go back to our shoes example for </v>

104
00:05:11.561 --> 00:05:12.950
<v Speaker 2>just a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but actually this is,</v>

105
00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to tell you the story of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>real company.</v>

106
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:17.830
<v Speaker 2>This is a company from the north of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany and it's called Desmos.</v>

107
00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.390
<v Speaker 2>It's not a particularly big business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It has around 200 staff now,</v>

108
00:05:25.391 --> 00:05:26.224
<v Speaker 2>this company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started right after the war being </v>

109
00:05:27.521 --> 00:05:31.990
<v Speaker 2>founded in 1946 and they specialized in </v>
<v Speaker 2>making machines for shoe manufacturing.</v>

110
00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:33.003
<v Speaker 2>Now in order to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they needed to import lots of machines </v>

111
00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.410
<v Speaker 2>from the United States and thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>having a stable currency,</v>

112
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:41.770
<v Speaker 2>the price for importing those machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was relatively low.</v>

113
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:44.500
<v Speaker 2>They then decided to rent the facility </v>
<v Speaker 2>because at the end of the day,</v>

114
00:05:44.501 --> 00:05:45.334
<v Speaker 2>since there was no inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rents would not go up and they could </v>

115
00:05:47.801 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 2>calculate the future cost.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of this space reliable,</v>

116
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.890
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

117
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since German companies could offer lower</v>

118
00:05:58.671 --> 00:06:02.030
<v Speaker 2>prices,</v>
<v Speaker 2>desmond had to innovate and in 1960 they</v>

119
00:06:02.031 --> 00:06:02.864
<v Speaker 2>invested in state of the art </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies to manufacture rubber sole </v>

120
00:06:05.841 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 2>shoes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years later,</v>

121
00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 2>decimate was the world leader in pvc </v>
<v Speaker 2>souls.</v>

122
00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:13.303
<v Speaker 2>It's in fact like lever at the soles of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the shoes you're wearing right now are </v>

123
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 2>made by a decimal machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This company with 200 staff now sells to</v>

124
00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:22.120
<v Speaker 2>every country in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including,</v>

125
00:06:22.121 --> 00:06:22.200
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

126
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:23.033
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

127
00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.593
<v Speaker 2>I need know.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is just one example of the </v>

128
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:31.740
<v Speaker 2>thousands of small and medium sized </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

129
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>The so called middle stand vertically </v>
<v Speaker 2>made up Germany,</v>

130
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.053
<v Speaker 2>the middle stand success as attracted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>admiring glances from the rest of </v>

131
00:06:39.181 --> 00:06:40.014
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's built on foundations that may </v>

132
00:06:42.151 --> 00:06:43.860
<v Speaker 2>be hard to copy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>

133
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.723
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know Jim and mark is a thing of the </v>

134
00:06:45.811 --> 00:06:46.644
<v Speaker 2>past because in 2008 the Germans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they abandon this currency and they </v>

135
00:06:49.831 --> 00:06:52.440
<v Speaker 2>adopted the euro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about it,</v>

136
00:06:52.441 --> 00:06:53.274
<v Speaker 2>while other countries like Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were using weaker countries before </v>

137
00:06:56.010 --> 00:06:59.160
<v Speaker 2>Germany had had a strong currency for </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

138
00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.333
<v Speaker 2>That means that in 2002 German companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>were already more competitive than </v>

139
00:07:05.671 --> 00:07:07.380
<v Speaker 2>anyone else's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But again,</v>

140
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:08.243
<v Speaker 2>hold on a minute because there's many </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things that can explain the </v>

141
00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.470
<v Speaker 2>success of the German model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's dig into these now</v>

142
00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:17.133
<v Speaker 2>the educational system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now I can probably guess what you're </v>

143
00:07:19.211 --> 00:07:20.080
<v Speaker 2>gonna say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

144
00:07:20.081 --> 00:07:22.750
<v Speaker 2>Zion in Germany isn't really famous for </v>
<v Speaker 2>its educational system,</v>

145
00:07:22.751 --> 00:07:24.160
<v Speaker 2>is it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to some extent,</v>

146
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 2>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the piece of revolt,</v>

147
00:07:25.811 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 2>Germany isn't even ranking inside the </v>
<v Speaker 2>top 10 but then again,</v>

148
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:32.530
<v Speaker 2>German students managed to find a job </v>
<v Speaker 2>right after they finish their studies.</v>

149
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:35.200
<v Speaker 2>So we've not such a great educational </v>
<v Speaker 2>system world.</v>

150
00:07:35.201 --> 00:07:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Why is this happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

151
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:42.100
<v Speaker 2>the answer of that actually the in that </v>
<v Speaker 2>boot Haitian or training system.</v>

152
00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:42.963
<v Speaker 2>Now let's imagine you're a high school </v>
<v Speaker 2>students in Germany and you don't want </v>

153
00:07:45.071 --> 00:07:48.410
<v Speaker 2>to go to university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So instead you decide to study to become</v>

154
00:07:48.411 --> 00:07:49.660
<v Speaker 2>made plummet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

155
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:50.523
<v Speaker 2>from the first moment you're already </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be working for a company which </v>

156
00:07:53.051 --> 00:07:53.884
<v Speaker 2>has an arrangement with the school.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means from Monday to Wednesday you </v>

157
00:07:56.651 --> 00:08:00.070
<v Speaker 2>go to a classroom and from Thursday to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Friday you go to the company's workshops</v>

158
00:08:01.400 --> 00:08:02.760
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

159
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.300
<v Speaker 2>that you would be trained by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>experienced plumbers and you would get a</v>

160
00:08:07.301 --> 00:08:08.134
<v Speaker 2>salary of between 300 to $500 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this salary is actually pretty </v>

161
00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:12.724
<v Speaker 2>important because it means that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company that a pain you really want to </v>

162
00:08:15.881 --> 00:08:17.080
<v Speaker 2>make you work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

163
00:08:17.170 --> 00:08:19.420
<v Speaker 2>otherwise the firms pretty much just </v>
<v Speaker 2>throwing money away.</v>

164
00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:20.283
<v Speaker 1>Wait.</v>

165
00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.833
<v Speaker 2>The outcome of this is that Jen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>students know how it is to be in a real </v>

166
00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:29.940
<v Speaker 2>life working environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

167
00:08:29.970 --> 00:08:33.420
<v Speaker 2>many of them actually remain in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company where they did their training is</v>

168
00:08:33.421 --> 00:08:35.610
<v Speaker 2>of course these gen and funds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In exchange,</v>

169
00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.730
<v Speaker 2>they get well trained workers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>another on the subject of workers.</v>

170
00:08:38.731 --> 00:08:42.030
<v Speaker 2>Let us move on to another key piece of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the German system.</v>

171
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>German</v>

172
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.520
<v Speaker 2>trade unions in other countries like </v>
<v Speaker 2>France or Spain,</v>

173
00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.740
<v Speaker 2>most of the labor laws are made by </v>
<v Speaker 2>parliaments,</v>

174
00:08:50.741 --> 00:08:51.574
<v Speaker 2>but that's not the case in Germany until</v>
<v Speaker 2>2015 gentleman's didn't even have a </v>

175
00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:57.540
<v Speaker 2>minimum.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Salaries were negotiated by trade unions</v>

176
00:08:57.541 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 2>and employers in Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syndicates are extremely important.</v>

177
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:01.463
<v Speaker 2>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those big companies like Audi or BMW </v>

178
00:09:03.390 --> 00:09:04.223
<v Speaker 2>with more than 2000 workers are required</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have union representatives on their </v>

179
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:08.544
<v Speaker 2>administrative.</v>

180
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.023
<v Speaker 2>Instead of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Siemens has 10 shareholder </v>

181
00:09:13.401 --> 00:09:14.234
<v Speaker 2>representatives on their board and </v>
<v Speaker 2>therefore they must have 10 people </v>

182
00:09:16.731 --> 00:09:18.470
<v Speaker 2>representing the workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Remember that?</v>

183
00:09:18.471 --> 00:09:19.304
<v Speaker 2>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>because it makes a big difference in </v>

184
00:09:20.631 --> 00:09:22.340
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's an example of another country.</v>

185
00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:23.233
<v Speaker 2>I think company like Telefonica has no </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade union representatives on their </v>

186
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:27.374
<v Speaker 2>board of administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The unions going to be participate in </v>

187
00:09:29.661 --> 00:09:30.494
<v Speaker 2>another body,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is called the company council and </v>

188
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.650
<v Speaker 2>they can only speak about matters that </v>
<v Speaker 2>affect salaries or working conditions.</v>

189
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:37.633
<v Speaker 2>Now by contrast in Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade unions have a voice on every </v>

190
00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:43.650
<v Speaker 2>decision that the company makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When Siemens wants to start operating in</v>

191
00:09:43.651 --> 00:09:44.484
<v Speaker 2>a new market or launch a new product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to ask the shareholders of </v>

192
00:09:47.271 --> 00:09:49.550
<v Speaker 2>course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they also have to ask for that trade</v>

193
00:09:49.551 --> 00:09:54.551
<v Speaker 2>union representatives.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now you might be wondering,</v>

194
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.210
<v Speaker 2>isn't this just bad news for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>company?</v>

195
00:09:58.211 --> 00:09:59.044
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we pretty much take it for granted that </v>

196
00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:02.800
<v Speaker 2>unions and companies not exactly best </v>
<v Speaker 2>friends.</v>

197
00:10:02.950 --> 00:10:04.810
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't actually have to be that way.</v>

198
00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:07.000
<v Speaker 2>Think about it for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to this setup,</v>

199
00:10:07.030 --> 00:10:07.863
<v Speaker 2>Siemens and bmws workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know whether a company is doing </v>

200
00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:12.004
<v Speaker 2>well or whether they're losing money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course when things are going bad </v>

201
00:10:14.711 --> 00:10:15.544
<v Speaker 2>for the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can make compromises like reducing </v>

202
00:10:17.501 --> 00:10:19.860
<v Speaker 2>their working hours instead of being </v>
<v Speaker 2>fired,</v>

203
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:23.503
<v Speaker 2>cut working hours at German facilities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This explains why during the financial </v>

204
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:31.310
<v Speaker 2>crisis of 2008 German companies didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>fire a large number of people.</v>

205
00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is good for the workers.</v>

206
00:10:33.670 --> 00:10:34.550
<v Speaker 2>It's good for the company.</v>

207
00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.820
<v Speaker 2>Wait a minute because I know what you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>

208
00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:40.654
<v Speaker 2>Please.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jen and trade unions are collaborating </v>

209
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:45.280
<v Speaker 2>with big capitalists in order to exploit</v>
<v Speaker 2>the workers rice,</v>

210
00:10:45.281 --> 00:10:46.510
<v Speaker 2>rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it must be happening.</v>

211
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:48.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is actually,</v>

212
00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.113
<v Speaker 2>certainly not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that the average wage in </v>

213
00:10:51.701 --> 00:10:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Germany is around 3,400 US dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month.</v>

214
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:55.623
<v Speaker 2>That's higher than the state of New York</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's in a country with a pretty </v>

215
00:10:57.821 --> 00:11:01.060
<v Speaker 2>affordable cost of living.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A flat in Berlin is about half the price</v>

216
00:11:01.061 --> 00:11:03.850
<v Speaker 2>of a flat in New York City and despite </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this,</v>

217
00:11:03.851 --> 00:11:04.684
<v Speaker 2>Germany maintains its position as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third biggest country when it comes to </v>

218
00:11:07.541 --> 00:11:08.374
<v Speaker 2>export.</v>

219
00:11:11.140 --> 00:11:11.973
<v Speaker 2>So then the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think your country could benefit </v>

220
00:11:13.511 --> 00:11:14.344
<v Speaker 2>from the German model or perhaps do you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think these policies are impossible to </v>

221
00:11:17.031 --> 00:11:17.864
<v Speaker 2>implement elsewhere?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Please leave us your answers in the </v>

222
00:11:19.931 --> 00:11:21.910
<v Speaker 2>comments section below.</v>
