<v Speaker 2>Thursday,</v>
<v Speaker 2>December 28 2017 the year was bound to </v>

3
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.140
<v Speaker 2>ams and the world gets ready to welcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 like every year.</v>

4
00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.170
<v Speaker 2>Newsrooms are practically on pause and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tony talk about three basic topics reuse</v>

5
00:00:20.331 --> 00:00:21.164
<v Speaker 2>on 2017 predictions of what 2018 may </v>
<v Speaker 2>bring and to news about how the arrival </v>

6
00:00:25.731 --> 00:00:29.090
<v Speaker 2>of the New Year we'll be celebrated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nitty every corner of it.</v>

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:29.963
<v Speaker 1>The wells,</v>

8
00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.340
<v Speaker 2>however you have,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are thirsty to some of the 28th when</v>

9
00:00:39.341 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 2>the year seemed to be over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This news came out,</v>

10
00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.330
<v Speaker 2>numerous protests and demonstrations </v>
<v Speaker 2>began to emerge throughout Iran.</v>

11
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.240
<v Speaker 2>It all began in the city of Masada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Historic,</v>

12
00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.160
<v Speaker 2>she knows pilgrimage site,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hometown of the supreme leader,</v>

13
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:51.994
<v Speaker 2>Ayatollah common aim,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's one of the bastions of the </v>

14
00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:54.964
<v Speaker 2>regime.</v>

15
00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.880
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprisingly it was here in this Islamic</v>

16
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.760
<v Speaker 2>Revolution Sanctuary for the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>antigovernment protests emerged.</v>

17
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 2>Some demonstrations spread quickly </v>
<v Speaker 2>throughout the country,</v>

18
00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:10.720
<v Speaker 2>resulting in more than 20 deaths and </v>
<v Speaker 2>over a thousand detainees.</v>

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.670
<v Speaker 2>But that's that time when everything was</v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning.</v>

20
00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.533
<v Speaker 2>Many people wondered if we were </v>
<v Speaker 2>witnessing the birth of a new kind of </v>

21
00:01:16.181 --> 00:01:18.580
<v Speaker 2>Persian spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The president of the United States.</v>

22
00:01:18.581 --> 00:01:19.414
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump seem to suggest that Iran </v>
<v Speaker 2>is failing at every level despite the </v>

23
00:01:23.171 --> 00:01:25.570
<v Speaker 2>terrible deal made with them by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama administration.</v>

24
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.660
<v Speaker 2>The great Iranian people had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>repressed for many years.</v>

25
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.660
<v Speaker 2>They are hungry for food and for freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with human rights.</v>

26
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.680
<v Speaker 2>The wealth of a ram is being looted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Time for Change Butts.</v>

27
00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.520
<v Speaker 2>Just the moments if we really witnessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>an incipient Persians spring,</v>

28
00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.120
<v Speaker 2>have we rarely seen the powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>ayatollah's regime wobble?</v>

29
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.080
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

30
00:01:44.081 --> 00:01:44.914
<v Speaker 2>we haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not imminently at least you'll see what </v>

31
00:01:47.141 --> 00:01:48.220
<v Speaker 2>I mean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just a moment.</v>

32
00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.393
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not being at the beginning of a Persian </v>

33
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:56.794
<v Speaker 2>spring doesn't mean that Iran isn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>undergoing events that are very </v>

34
00:01:59.591 --> 00:02:02.650
<v Speaker 2>important to the country's future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hands by extension,</v>

35
00:02:02.651 --> 00:02:04.180
<v Speaker 2>important to the future of the Middle </v>
<v Speaker 2>East.</v>

36
00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.420
<v Speaker 2>So the viewer here we have three key </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>

37
00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why do these protests occur?</v>

38
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.780
<v Speaker 2>What would their cause seconds who lit </v>
<v Speaker 2>this entire movement spark?</v>

39
00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.240
<v Speaker 2>And third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what can we expect?</v>

40
00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 2>Will these events have any effects on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran?</v>

41
00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:20.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's answer these three questions and </v>

42
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:26.050
<v Speaker 2>see why all of these movements show us </v>
<v Speaker 2>how the Islamic Revolution in Iran,</v>

43
00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.913
<v Speaker 2>the totalitarian regime that now </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls the country is facing rapid </v>

44
00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:35.160
<v Speaker 2>erosion fires,</v>
<v Speaker 2>causes,</v>

45
00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.530
<v Speaker 2>as we've seen in previous videos here on</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual politic,</v>

46
00:02:43.531 --> 00:02:47.550
<v Speaker 2>Iran is one of the countries with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most natural resources in the world.</v>

47
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.413
<v Speaker 2>It has the fourth largest oil reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the second largest natural gas reserves </v>

48
00:02:51.571 --> 00:02:52.710
<v Speaker 2>as their copper,</v>
<v Speaker 2>iron,</v>

49
00:02:52.711 --> 00:02:53.491
<v Speaker 2>zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uranium,</v>

50
00:02:53.491 --> 00:02:54.324
<v Speaker 2>and silver deposits among many other </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources are also among the largest in </v>

51
00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:59.410
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's not all.</v>

52
00:02:59.411 --> 00:03:00.244
<v Speaker 2>If that one's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also has a relatively young as well </v>

53
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>educated population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

54
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.810
<v Speaker 2>every year almost 5 million young people</v>
<v Speaker 2>attend university.</v>

55
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.270
<v Speaker 2>In principle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems like this country,</v>

56
00:03:11.271 --> 00:03:14.440
<v Speaker 2>you should have an easy time getting </v>
<v Speaker 2>things to go well for us,</v>

57
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:15.820
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite this,</v>

58
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:18.220
<v Speaker 2>it's economy is a disaster.</v>

59
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.913
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

60
00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:25.803
<v Speaker 2>Employment shortage in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially for the youngest who suffer </v>

61
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.290
<v Speaker 2>unemployment rates of 40% inflation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also in the double digits.</v>

62
00:03:32.291 --> 00:03:36.250
<v Speaker 2>The currency has suffered notable </v>
<v Speaker 2>depreciation and the government has been</v>

63
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:38.740
<v Speaker 2>forced to cut several social benefit.</v>

64
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.373
<v Speaker 2>This all clashes head on with the huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectations generated from the 2015 </v>

65
00:03:47.971 --> 00:03:49.320
<v Speaker 2>nuclear agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

66
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:50.183
<v Speaker 2>there was widespread hope that this </v>
<v Speaker 2>government would be a turning point for </v>

67
00:03:53.371 --> 00:03:54.204
<v Speaker 2>the country's economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Investments would begin to arrive in </v>

68
00:03:56.251 --> 00:03:59.280
<v Speaker 2>world markets would reopen to do </v>
<v Speaker 2>business with Iran.</v>

69
00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:00.143
<v Speaker 2>President Rohani himself supported this </v>
<v Speaker 2>thesis and the truth is since the </v>

70
00:04:03.481 --> 00:04:05.910
<v Speaker 2>agreement was signed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things they have improved.</v>

71
00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.890
<v Speaker 2>Since many of the sanctions were lifted </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2016 not all of them,</v>

72
00:04:10.891 --> 00:04:11.724
<v Speaker 2>though the United States actually still </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintained several oil production has </v>

73
00:04:14.191 --> 00:04:15.024
<v Speaker 2>increased by 20% public accounts have </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved and the growth rate has sought </v>

74
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.980
<v Speaker 2>to almost 7%</v>

75
00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.163
<v Speaker 2>these changes haven't been enough among </v>
<v Speaker 2>other things because the Iranian </v>

76
00:04:26.241 --> 00:04:29.150
<v Speaker 2>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has more holes than Swiss cheese.</v>

77
00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.420
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption is very widespread.</v>

78
00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:37.220
<v Speaker 2>A good section of the economy is in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands of corporations that are linked to</v>

79
00:04:37.221 --> 00:04:39.260
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>religious foundations,</v>

80
00:04:39.261 --> 00:04:40.094
<v Speaker 2>and the powerful revolution regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they of course receive all kinds of </v>

81
00:04:43.971 --> 00:04:44.804
<v Speaker 2>privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It isn't fair that a lot of Iranian </v>

82
00:04:47.311 --> 00:04:48.144
<v Speaker 2>suffer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while a large part of the budget is </v>

83
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 2>allocated to Islamic organizations whose</v>
<v Speaker 2>functions we don't know that well,</v>

84
00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:53.863
<v Speaker 2>poverty takes over everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even people's religion Mussa of retired </v>

85
00:04:56.661 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 2>person and participate in the protest </v>
<v Speaker 2>rallies in Tehran.</v>

86
00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:00.463
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is estimated that it's a bit more </v>

87
00:05:01.641 --> 00:05:02.474
<v Speaker 2>than 20% of the economy belongs to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>we might consider the purely private </v>

88
00:05:06.381 --> 00:05:07.280
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

89
00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>Really only 20% c doing business in Iran</v>
<v Speaker 2>is really,</v>

90
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:12.253
<v Speaker 2>really complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seeing the world's banks doing business </v>

91
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:16.934
<v Speaker 2>ranking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which measures how easy it is to do </v>

92
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:22.841
<v Speaker 2>business in a country ranked Iran in </v>
<v Speaker 2>position 124 as if we take a look at the</v>

93
00:05:23.271 --> 00:05:26.510
<v Speaker 2>economic freedom index.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The results are even worse.</v>

94
00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:30.430
<v Speaker 2>They occupy the 155th place and well </v>
<v Speaker 2>Iran,</v>

95
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.333
<v Speaker 2>it isn't even a World Trade Organization</v>
<v Speaker 2>member and it maintains average tariffs </v>

96
00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.770
<v Speaker 2>of approximately 25%</v>

97
00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:43.490
<v Speaker 2>I did that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When's enough?</v>

98
00:05:43.491 --> 00:05:45.770
<v Speaker 2>The government spends huge results is </v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad,</v>

99
00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.120
<v Speaker 2>can Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon,</v>

100
00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.073
<v Speaker 2>Iraq and Yemen for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in addition to spending a loss of </v>

101
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:54.620
<v Speaker 2>Iran scas money fuels the investment </v>
<v Speaker 2>community's panic.</v>

102
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.483
<v Speaker 2>Just think about it for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is willing to their savings in a </v>

103
00:05:58.131 --> 00:05:59.450
<v Speaker 2>country like Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

104
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.760
<v Speaker 2>don't tell me that's not just a little </v>
<v Speaker 2>bit scary.</v>

105
00:06:02.290 --> 00:06:03.123
<v Speaker 2>The main problem comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutions export ideology and from </v>

106
00:06:05.631 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>supporting the Shiite groups from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lebanon to Yemen.</v>

107
00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:08.803
<v Speaker 2>The system spends money on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>campaigns without taking the needs of </v>

108
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 2>the people into account far Mars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>last student and activist.</v>

109
00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.033
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results of this disastrous motto </v>

110
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 2>falls on the shoulders of Iran citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially its youngest,</v>

111
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.513
<v Speaker 2>and this is important to it because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is estimated that around 50% of the </v>

112
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 2>country's population is less than 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years old.</v>

113
00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:34.220
<v Speaker 2>Now we know what sparked this protest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but is behind all of this.</v>

114
00:06:34.310 --> 00:06:35.143
<v Speaker 2>Who organized the first rallies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it actually have been the United </v>

115
00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:38.953
<v Speaker 2>States as the Toronto regime denounced?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could it have been a well organized and </v>

116
00:06:41.541 --> 00:06:43.070
<v Speaker 2>well prepared?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's political opposition.</v>

117
00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:44.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's see that.</v>

118
00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.700
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've hit because you might be surprised.</v>

119
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:53.090
<v Speaker 1>The instigator.</v>

120
00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:57.053
<v Speaker 2>At first they were as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>several interpretations about what was </v>

121
00:06:59.521 --> 00:07:00.354
<v Speaker 2>happening and one of them was the theory</v>
<v Speaker 2>that a popular revolution could be </v>

122
00:07:03.181 --> 00:07:05.800
<v Speaker 2>starting a very particular Persian </v>
<v Speaker 2>spring.</v>

123
00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.163
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you view,</v>

124
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:11.320
<v Speaker 2>it was soon clear that some pieces did </v>
<v Speaker 2>not seem to fit at all.</v>

125
00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:13.660
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand is protest,</v>

126
00:07:13.661 --> 00:07:14.494
<v Speaker 2>it's exploded in some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled and most talkative cities in </v>

127
00:07:17.591 --> 00:07:19.040
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hands on,</v>

128
00:07:19.041 --> 00:07:22.240
<v Speaker 2>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called 2009 green revolution this</v>

129
00:07:22.241 --> 00:07:25.150
<v Speaker 2>time the main role did not fall on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>middle classes,</v>

130
00:07:25.151 --> 00:07:27.250
<v Speaker 2>which tend to be more secular and </v>
<v Speaker 2>reformist,</v>

131
00:07:27.251 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 2>but curiously on the poorer conservative</v>
<v Speaker 2>causes.</v>

132
00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:33.580
<v Speaker 2>And so on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first protest of messages were aimed</v>

133
00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:37.570
<v Speaker 2>mainly at the president's isn't clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>who has organized these demonstrations,</v>

134
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:40.020
<v Speaker 2>but most slogans were against raw honey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How mom had,</v>

135
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:40.854
<v Speaker 2>he is as ours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>editor in chief c even though elections </v>

136
00:07:43.691 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 2>are held in Iran to choose the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

137
00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.610
<v Speaker 2>candidates are ultimately chosen by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>supreme leader.</v>

138
00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:52.000
<v Speaker 2>The ayatollah who at the moment of truth</v>
<v Speaker 2>has the last word.</v>

139
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.093
<v Speaker 2>This is why he's the supreme leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the fact is the president of </v>

140
00:07:56.811 --> 00:07:57.644
<v Speaker 2>Rouhani,</v>
<v Speaker 2>honey is let's say a reformist and a </v>

141
00:07:59.831 --> 00:08:00.664
<v Speaker 2>soft hearted political leader of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as much of a reformist and softhearted </v>

142
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:07.060
<v Speaker 2>vertical leader as we could expect in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>regime like Iran.</v>

143
00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 2>And while he may not have reached every </v>
<v Speaker 2>expectation,</v>

144
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:13.960
<v Speaker 2>he did take some steps towards a certain</v>
<v Speaker 2>amount of openness in the country.</v>

145
00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:15.303
<v Speaker 2>Under Mr raw honey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strict Islamic rules have been somewhat </v>

146
00:08:17.051 --> 00:08:18.820
<v Speaker 2>relaxed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>concerts have been allowed,</v>

147
00:08:18.821 --> 00:08:21.160
<v Speaker 2>and the morals police are largely off </v>
<v Speaker 2>the streets.</v>

148
00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:23.290
<v Speaker 2>Illegal parties that usually no longer </v>
<v Speaker 2>rated,</v>

149
00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:24.303
<v Speaker 2>although there have been exceptions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if what you're demanding are more </v>

150
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:27.964
<v Speaker 2>reforms and more freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>attacking the most reformist president </v>

151
00:08:31.031 --> 00:08:33.730
<v Speaker 2>would seem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the very least rather curious,</v>

152
00:08:33.731 --> 00:08:34.564
<v Speaker 2>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

153
00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:37.420
<v Speaker 2>as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this does have an explanation.</v>

154
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.360
<v Speaker 2>The powerful revolution regards main </v>
<v Speaker 2>chief himself,</v>

155
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:43.810
<v Speaker 2>Muhammed Ali Jafari made it very clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>at first,</v>

156
00:08:43.811 --> 00:08:44.644
<v Speaker 2>the instigators leader was none other </v>
<v Speaker 2>than the former president Ahmadinejad </v>

157
00:08:47.711 --> 00:08:52.711
<v Speaker 2>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right.</v>

158
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.153
<v Speaker 2>Ultra conservative groups organized the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first protests to erode the reformists </v>

159
00:08:58.591 --> 00:09:02.400
<v Speaker 2>political capitol bird of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in a country where 50% of the population</v>

160
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 2>is less than 30 whether it's widespread </v>
<v Speaker 2>frustration.</v>

161
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:07.740
<v Speaker 2>And above all smartphones and Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>access.</v>

162
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:12.300
<v Speaker 2>It's not a surprise that the contagion </v>
<v Speaker 2>spread very quickly within hours.</v>

163
00:09:12.301 --> 00:09:13.134
<v Speaker 2>The calls to protest spread through </v>
<v Speaker 2>social networks and communication </v>

164
00:09:15.091 --> 00:09:15.924
<v Speaker 2>applications such as telegram,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the most popular application and the </v>

165
00:09:18.121 --> 00:09:18.954
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly spontaneous protests broke out </v>

166
00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:21.440
<v Speaker 2>all over the car.</v>

167
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:22.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure</v>

168
00:09:25.920 --> 00:09:26.753
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>complaints about the economic situation </v>

169
00:09:28.021 --> 00:09:29.880
<v Speaker 2>we're seeing joins by demands for </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>

170
00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could really save the all of this got</v>

171
00:09:31.951 --> 00:09:33.840
<v Speaker 2>rather out of hands for the ultra </v>
<v Speaker 2>conservative.</v>

172
00:09:37.890 --> 00:09:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Of course the government didn't take </v>
<v Speaker 2>long to reactions.</v>

173
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.123
<v Speaker 2>Use the force.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can all imagine a dictatorship like </v>

174
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.240
<v Speaker 2>this has detentions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>considerable threats,</v>

175
00:09:45.241 --> 00:09:47.250
<v Speaker 2>and even capital punishment due to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebellion,</v>

176
00:09:47.251 --> 00:09:48.084
<v Speaker 2>freeze in connection with foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>intelligence services or began as for </v>

177
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:53.670
<v Speaker 2>the recent days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>developments in the country and it means</v>

178
00:09:53.671 --> 00:09:54.504
<v Speaker 2>have been united to create problems for </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Islamic system by using various </v>

179
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:59.160
<v Speaker 2>means including money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons,</v>

180
00:09:59.220 --> 00:10:02.160
<v Speaker 2>politics and security apparatus </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ayatollah Khomeini,</v>

181
00:10:02.290 --> 00:10:03.123
<v Speaker 2>their response was so big that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government has just announced a </v>

182
00:10:05.311 --> 00:10:06.144
<v Speaker 2>prohibition on teaching English in </v>
<v Speaker 2>primary schools supposedly to avoid </v>

183
00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.310
<v Speaker 2>cultural invasion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

184
00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:13.230
<v Speaker 2>all of this stops the protests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

185
00:10:13.260 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 2>even though we aren't facing a Persian </v>
<v Speaker 2>and spraying,</v>

186
00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.373
<v Speaker 2>the fact is that all these events showed</v>
<v Speaker 2>several of the totalitarian regimes </v>

187
00:10:19.621 --> 00:10:24.621
<v Speaker 2>weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

188
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.883
<v Speaker 2>have a failed revolution since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic Revolution took place back in </v>

189
00:10:33.641 --> 00:10:34.474
<v Speaker 2>1979 the wrong government has made a lot</v>
<v Speaker 2>of efforts to achieve a strong national </v>

190
00:10:38.471 --> 00:10:41.700
<v Speaker 2>identity built on religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

191
00:10:41.950 --> 00:10:42.783
<v Speaker 2>according to the Iranian news agency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are more than one and a half </v>

192
00:10:45.041 --> 00:10:45.874
<v Speaker 2>million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

193
00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:46.713
<v Speaker 2>one and a half million clerics teaching </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Koran and promoting Islamic </v>

194
00:10:50.351 --> 00:10:54.220
<v Speaker 2>principles in schools and in all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of educational institutions.</v>

195
00:10:58.260 --> 00:11:00.030
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite all these efforts,</v>

196
00:11:00.031 --> 00:11:02.820
<v Speaker 2>Iranian society,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as we saw is very,</v>

197
00:11:02.821 --> 00:11:03.654
<v Speaker 2>very young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is becoming increasingly secular and </v>

198
00:11:05.401 --> 00:11:07.880
<v Speaker 2>increasingly dissatisfied with a country</v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

199
00:11:07.881 --> 00:11:10.050
<v Speaker 2>If that lies far from their way of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking.</v>

200
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:10.973
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Internet has played a key role in </v>

201
00:11:12.691 --> 00:11:12.940
<v Speaker 2>all of it.</v>

202
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

203
00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:16.473
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we add the regimes inability to </v>

204
00:11:17.711 --> 00:11:20.590
<v Speaker 2>generate opportunities for all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>young people to all of this,</v>

205
00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:24.850
<v Speaker 2>it isn't unreasonable to think that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>will witness a very fast erosion of this</v>

206
00:11:24.851 --> 00:11:27.640
<v Speaker 2>country's political pillars in the next </v>
<v Speaker 2>few years.</v>

207
00:11:27.670 --> 00:11:28.091
<v Speaker 2>Mind,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you?</v>

208
00:11:28.091 --> 00:11:30.340
<v Speaker 2>This is harder to imagine in Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia,</v>

209
00:11:30.341 --> 00:11:31.174
<v Speaker 2>and even then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are beginning to see it with the </v>

210
00:11:32.621 --> 00:11:35.650
<v Speaker 2>changes that Crown Prince Mohammed bin </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salman is introducing.</v>

211
00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:37.510
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they Raelian society is much more open,</v>

212
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.403
<v Speaker 2>much more secular,</v>
<v Speaker 2>independent of religion and better </v>

213
00:11:40.211 --> 00:11:41.110
<v Speaker 2>formed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>

214
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.730
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll just have to wait and see.</v>

215
00:11:43.870 --> 00:11:46.570
<v Speaker 2>But now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that the ayatollah's regime</v>

216
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:47.433
<v Speaker 2>will be able to contain such a changing </v>
<v Speaker 2>force where we begin to see changes in </v>

217
00:11:50.951 --> 00:11:51.641
<v Speaker 2>Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
