1
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea or as Kim Jong UN would call the </v>

2
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:12.583
<v Speaker 1>Bad Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard of this country </v>

3
00:00:13.701 --> 00:00:15.350
<v Speaker 1>because it's probably the way your </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile phone,</v>

4
00:00:15.351 --> 00:00:16.184
<v Speaker 1>your TV screen or possibly even your car</v>
<v Speaker 1>with manufacturers or perhaps because </v>

5
00:00:19.791 --> 00:00:23.970
<v Speaker 1>it's the place where the most watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube video of all time came from lone</v>

6
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.460
<v Speaker 1>star.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

7
00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.303
<v Speaker 1>South Korea is a big power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only at the cultural level but also </v>

8
00:00:35.101 --> 00:00:35.934
<v Speaker 1>at an economic one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure every one of you watching this </v>

9
00:00:37.681 --> 00:00:38.514
<v Speaker 1>video haven't least one product from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung or lg arounds you South Korean </v>

10
00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:46.830
<v Speaker 1>companies on absolutely on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a surprise given that in the</v>

11
00:00:46.831 --> 00:00:47.664
<v Speaker 1>19 sixties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea was an extremely poor </v>

12
00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:53.170
<v Speaker 1>country and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about relative poverty</v>

13
00:00:53.171 --> 00:00:54.004
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other countries like Zimbabwe where </v>

14
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.030
<v Speaker 1>actually more developed with this,</v>

15
00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.113
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

16
00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:02.073
<v Speaker 1>The West in just one generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Koreans went from starvation to </v>

17
00:01:05.631 --> 00:01:06.464
<v Speaker 1>one of the most prosperous societies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and so now comes the big </v>

18
00:01:10.191 --> 00:01:11.024
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What exactly did South Korea do to </v>

19
00:01:12.831 --> 00:01:13.664
<v Speaker 1>become quite so rich and hold on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second because if you're a regular </v>

20
00:01:16.251 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably know what you're thinking.</v>

21
00:01:18.081 --> 00:01:18.950
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

22
00:01:18.951 --> 00:01:19.784
<v Speaker 1>it's another video where visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell me how marvelously wealthier </v>

23
00:01:22.401 --> 00:01:24.800
<v Speaker 1>country became because of free market </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

24
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.290
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice,</v>

25
00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>while I'm sorry to disappoint you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

26
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.010
<v Speaker 1>not as much of the story of South Korea </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a bit different.</v>

27
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:31.903
<v Speaker 2>Fritz</v>

28
00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>compared with their neighbors to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>

29
00:01:37.471 --> 00:01:38.304
<v Speaker 1>South Korea is a free paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their economic model has one </v>

30
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>peculiarity that sets it apart from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>

31
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.803
<v Speaker 1>So then the question is what are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons that explained this incredible </v>

32
00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:51.480
<v Speaker 1>progress in South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>

33
00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.230
<v Speaker 1>why was Gangnam style so controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>in South Korea?</v>

34
00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.303
<v Speaker 1>Both of these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise they are actually related and </v>

35
00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.083
<v Speaker 1>these are the questions that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer in today's video to the </v>

36
00:02:06.591 --> 00:02:08.150
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>

37
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:08.984
<v Speaker 1>in 1953,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Korean peninsula was split into two </v>

38
00:02:11.301 --> 00:02:14.660
<v Speaker 1>halves after a war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which killed over 2 million people.</v>

39
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.553
<v Speaker 1>At that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could actually say that South Korea </v>

40
00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:20.270
<v Speaker 1>is the country that was actually in more</v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble economically,</v>

41
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.120
<v Speaker 1>the normal pads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the industries and companies,</v>

42
00:02:23.121 --> 00:02:25.760
<v Speaker 1>while the south was agricultural and </v>
<v Speaker 1>under develop,</v>

43
00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.193
<v Speaker 1>had no desks and most of the children,</v>
<v Speaker 1>golden majority of their nutrition from </v>

44
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:36.470
<v Speaker 1>powdered milk that was given by theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s and Europe.</v>

45
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>This is why in 1960,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after many protests General Park Chung,</v>

46
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>he organized a coup d'etat and took </v>
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

47
00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.800
<v Speaker 1>This is how the first South Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship started.</v>

48
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:46.723
<v Speaker 1>During the following 27 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country had three different </v>

49
00:02:49.041 --> 00:02:51.560
<v Speaker 1>dictators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them came into power in a violent</v>

50
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>way by overthrowing the previous one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

51
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.290
<v Speaker 1>despite the political instability in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those times,</v>

52
00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.153
<v Speaker 1>the South Korean</v>

53
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:03.083
<v Speaker 1>a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this economy is not as free as </v>

54
00:03:05.351 --> 00:03:06.160
<v Speaker 1>you might.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

55
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.980
<v Speaker 1>a free market is organized in a bottom </v>
<v Speaker 1>up fashion.</v>

56
00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.730
<v Speaker 1>The private businesses decide how,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when and what they want to sell.</v>

57
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.713
<v Speaker 1>Then the state comes in and regulates </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that activity through various </v>

58
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:17.590
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.350
<v Speaker 1>puncturing east system was quite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>

60
00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>This was a top down system is policy was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to meet with the most important families</v>

61
00:03:25.211 --> 00:03:28.510
<v Speaker 1>in the country who controlled most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea's industries.</v>

62
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.210
<v Speaker 1>This group included the founders of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung and lg</v>

63
00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.113
<v Speaker 2>Jean,</v>

64
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>so essentially he put them in a room and</v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

65
00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.960
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from now on I will give you whatever you</v>

66
00:03:38.961 --> 00:03:39.794
<v Speaker 1>need to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If one year you kind of weigh your </v>

67
00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:42.290
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay,</v>

68
00:03:42.291 --> 00:03:44.430
<v Speaker 1>I'll forgive you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you need some ground swell?</v>

69
00:03:44.431 --> 00:03:45.650
<v Speaker 1>But here you go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can have it.</v>

70
00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:47.480
<v Speaker 1>You need to borrow some money from </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>

71
00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government is going to back your </v>

72
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:52.130
<v Speaker 1>loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if you can't pay your debts,</v>

73
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:57.160
<v Speaker 1>the state is going to help you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our country will be in jeopardy in order</v>

74
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:02.200
<v Speaker 1>for a country not to fall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must cultivate its own strength.</v>

75
00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other countries like France,</v>

76
00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.120
<v Speaker 1>South Korea didn't put up any barriers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to international trade.</v>

77
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Actually since that very first moments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the government's guaranteed rule of </v>

78
00:04:11.841 --> 00:04:16.310
<v Speaker 1>law and low taxes for all businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of where they came from.</v>

79
00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.383
<v Speaker 1>That's not only that's Pacchiu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gave all kinds of tax incentives for </v>

80
00:04:20.691 --> 00:04:23.900
<v Speaker 1>companies and individuals to invest and </v>
<v Speaker 1>save money.</v>

81
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.613
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big conglomerates like xy or Latte </v>

82
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:31.483
<v Speaker 1>gods to compete in an open markets with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other corporate juggernauts from Japan </v>

83
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>or the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time they also help from</v>

84
00:04:38.551 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>the government in South Korea has no </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources,</v>

85
00:04:41.671 --> 00:04:42.504
<v Speaker 1>but a big population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those companies put a focus on </v>

86
00:04:44.431 --> 00:04:49.431
<v Speaker 1>industries that required a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>workforce that's manufacturing and this.</v>

87
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:51.230
<v Speaker 1>This was the beginning of</v>

88
00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:55.513
<v Speaker 1>all nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine the life of one of the hundred </v>

89
00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.320
<v Speaker 1>thousand workers employed by Samsung in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea.</v>

90
00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>He gets up in the morning in a house </v>
<v Speaker 1>built by Cyt,</v>

91
00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.560
<v Speaker 1>the construction company run by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung Group wanting his breakfast.</v>

92
00:05:06.561 --> 00:05:07.394
<v Speaker 1>He watches the latest visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>video groups that we'd like to think on </v>

93
00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>his Samsung Galaxy phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he takes his Renno Samson car.</v>

94
00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:14.503
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You read that right?</v>

95
00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Rented cars are manufactured by Samsung </v>
<v Speaker 1>in South Korea.</v>

96
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:20.090
<v Speaker 1>And guess where as this car insurance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

97
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:21.240
<v Speaker 1>The all guessing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The friends here.</v>

98
00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:22.120
<v Speaker 1>He gets it from</v>

99
00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.953
<v Speaker 2>Samsung</v>

100
00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:27.360
<v Speaker 1>after a hard day working at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

101
00:05:27.361 --> 00:05:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're getting the picture now.</v>

102
00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:29.690
<v Speaker 1>Now South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

103
00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.860
<v Speaker 1>he wants to go get some beers with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>colleagues,</v>

104
00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:34.650
<v Speaker 1>so he goes to the Cantina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's again,</v>

105
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:35.543
<v Speaker 1>you're getting the picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can come and our friend wants to </v>

106
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 1>spend some quality time with his wife </v>
<v Speaker 1>and children,</v>

107
00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>so we decided to take them to a park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think you'd go?</v>

108
00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:44.123
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He goes to some things very own Disney </v>

109
00:05:45.721 --> 00:05:47.820
<v Speaker 1>style theme park.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

110
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.830
<v Speaker 1>if you work for Samsung,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company is everything.</v>

111
00:05:50.831 --> 00:05:51.664
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

112
00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 2>We're</v>

113
00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.373
<v Speaker 1>talking about the biggest cable and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of South Korea and now you might be </v>

114
00:05:58.941 --> 00:05:59.774
<v Speaker 1>wondering what exactly is the Chi ball </v>
<v Speaker 1>tribals are big conglomerates supported </v>

115
00:06:03.591 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>by the state?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them like to already defunct.</v>

116
00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Diu were started by the administration </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

117
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:11.210
<v Speaker 1>Others were born in the 1945.</v>

118
00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:14.963
<v Speaker 1>Most of them started being family owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as they grew they became public </v>

119
00:06:18.031 --> 00:06:18.864
<v Speaker 1>companies and all of them have a number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different business lines and </v>

120
00:06:21.451 --> 00:06:22.710
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

121
00:06:22.711 --> 00:06:25.290
<v Speaker 1>LG is famous for that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tvs and then mobile phones,</v>

122
00:06:25.291 --> 00:06:26.124
<v Speaker 1>but in South Korea they will all say the</v>
<v Speaker 1>distributors of Coca Cola in total </v>

123
00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.980
<v Speaker 1>around 100 cables.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ams,</v>

124
00:06:31.981 --> 00:06:35.160
<v Speaker 1>they own the biggest asset in the South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean economy.</v>

125
00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>

126
00:06:36.061 --> 00:06:38.610
<v Speaker 1>the government does place in red carpet </v>
<v Speaker 1>tons of their feet,</v>

127
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:41.250
<v Speaker 1>but this doesn't mean they have a blank </v>
<v Speaker 1>check.</v>

128
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.170
<v Speaker 1>This is why I went to Cabo as big as </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

129
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:48.171
<v Speaker 1>We went bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one came to bail is a clear incentive</v>

130
00:06:51.311 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 1>for these companies to be on the edge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

131
00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.640
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2008 Suny,</v>

132
00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.340
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese wanted to create the first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

133
00:06:58.350 --> 00:06:59.183
<v Speaker 1>led tvs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this technology there wasn't </v>

134
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:03.430
<v Speaker 1>advanced enough and the screens were </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty expensive,</v>

135
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.190
<v Speaker 1>even priced too high for most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>luxury markets.</v>

136
00:07:06.250 --> 00:07:07.083
<v Speaker 1>So the Sony guys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the project on hold and they never </v>

137
00:07:09.671 --> 00:07:10.504
<v Speaker 1>really got back almost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whereas South Korea and lg at the same </v>

138
00:07:13.001 --> 00:07:14.590
<v Speaker 1>technology now they have the same</v>

139
00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.713
<v Speaker 2>problem</v>

140
00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:19.210
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they do?</v>

141
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they launched mobile phones with a much </v>

142
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:23.740
<v Speaker 1>smaller display.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way.</v>

143
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:24.603
<v Speaker 1>They took advantage of their assets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what is more important is they learned </v>

144
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:28.953
<v Speaker 1>how to work with this new technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why in a very short amount of </v>

145
00:07:31.781 --> 00:07:32.614
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they found ways to produce affordable </v>

146
00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:35.343
<v Speaker 1>own led TV screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spell hold on for just a minute because </v>

147
00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>there's another more important parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps explain this very innovative</v>

148
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.493
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

149
00:07:44.650 --> 00:07:45.483
<v Speaker 1>South Korean education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll know it's South Korean children </v>

150
00:07:47.961 --> 00:07:48.794
<v Speaker 1>that have always had one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>marks in the international piece of </v>

151
00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:52.263
<v Speaker 1>test.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The whole country stops during </v>

152
00:07:53.151 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 1>university entrance exams in South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean school suspends it,</v>

153
00:07:56.150 --> 00:08:00.440
<v Speaker 1>whatever they need to guarantee the best</v>
<v Speaker 1>education for their boys and girls.</v>

154
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:02.300
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the flip side of this coin is that those</v>

155
00:08:02.301 --> 00:08:05.150
<v Speaker 1>kids have the biggest suicide rate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

156
00:08:05.300 --> 00:08:06.133
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of South Korea has a problem with </v>

157
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.414
<v Speaker 1>suicide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country having these second highest </v>

158
00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:13.190
<v Speaker 1>suicide rate per capita in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the beginning.</v>

159
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.083
<v Speaker 1>The government is understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cables would need high skilled </v>

160
00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.020
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

161
00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.250
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are they</v>

162
00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:22.083
<v Speaker 1>designed an educational system that </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in line with the nation's </v>

163
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:25.384
<v Speaker 1>companies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why South Korean children </v>

164
00:08:27.311 --> 00:08:30.040
<v Speaker 1>are incredibly good at math center of </v>
<v Speaker 1>excellence,</v>

165
00:08:30.041 --> 00:08:31.390
<v Speaker 1>memorization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>abilities.</v>

166
00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.970
<v Speaker 1>Further their respect for authority and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>

167
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.380
<v Speaker 1>It's always religious and this is why </v>
<v Speaker 1>none of them want to start a company.</v>

168
00:08:38.530 --> 00:08:42.340
<v Speaker 1>The dream of every South Korean is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>winds up working in one of these cables.</v>

169
00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:43.293
<v Speaker 1>If they work hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they might even become a manager and to </v>

170
00:08:45.311 --> 00:08:46.144
<v Speaker 1>get a house in paradise on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a famous district of Seoul with </v>

171
00:08:49.871 --> 00:08:52.000
<v Speaker 1>a name that's going to sound pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>familiar to you.</v>

172
00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the Gangnam district.</v>

173
00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:59.390
<v Speaker 2>Oh God.</v>

174
00:09:02.170 --> 00:09:07.170
<v Speaker 1>The meaning of Gangnam style called </v>
<v Speaker 1>human warm Gal during the day,</v>

175
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:09.123
<v Speaker 1>a glossy one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>someone who knows how to enjoy the </v>

176
00:09:10.511 --> 00:09:13.270
<v Speaker 1>freedom of a cup of coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the night comes down,</v>

177
00:09:13.271 --> 00:09:16.510
<v Speaker 1>her heart gets warmer because she has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal with two faces.</v>

178
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sexy lady,</v>

179
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:20.230
<v Speaker 1>your big brother,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gangnam style.</v>

180
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:25.160
<v Speaker 1>This is an extract from that famous song</v>
<v Speaker 1>that became so popular back in 2012,</v>

181
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:26.053
<v Speaker 1>even led to the main thing aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into some trouble with the </v>

182
00:09:28.281 --> 00:09:32.420
<v Speaker 1>authorities and due to the lyrics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having inappropriate content for society</v>

183
00:09:32.421 --> 00:09:34.280
<v Speaker 1>that's obsessed with respect for </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

184
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:35.173
<v Speaker 1>Something's aesthetics or something as </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical as the hipaa movements from </v>

185
00:09:38.031 --> 00:09:38.864
<v Speaker 1>Elvis back in the 19 fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that a hierarchical </v>

186
00:09:41.271 --> 00:09:42.104
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one which relies on a few big </v>

187
00:09:43.341 --> 00:09:44.174
<v Speaker 1>corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a good recipe for a state of the </v>

188
00:09:46.461 --> 00:09:47.510
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

189
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.420
<v Speaker 1>South Korea big as it is in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing industry,</v>

190
00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:53.210
<v Speaker 1>lags behind in other fields such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>services or.</v>

191
00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:54.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

192
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:05.600
<v Speaker 1>economy depends so much on governmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kabul decisions.</v>

193
00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:08.230
<v Speaker 1>There is almost no space for </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs.</v>

194
00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:09.163
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean even if you wanted to start a </v>

195
00:10:10.461 --> 00:10:11.294
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty hard to compete with your </v>

196
00:10:12.411 --> 00:10:14.590
<v Speaker 1>competitors are supported by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

197
00:10:14.650 --> 00:10:18.290
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these hierarchical structures are not as</v>

198
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:20.150
<v Speaker 1>efficient as you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

199
00:10:20.151 --> 00:10:20.984
<v Speaker 1>most of the Chi balls have become </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucratic bmo that require lots and </v>

200
00:10:24.561 --> 00:10:25.394
<v Speaker 1>lots of money to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phone leads the sales of mobile </v>

201
00:10:28.161 --> 00:10:30.320
<v Speaker 1>phones in the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

202
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.310
<v Speaker 1>they make almost no profits and that was</v>
<v Speaker 1>it</v>

203
00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.403
<v Speaker 2>probably</v>

204
00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:40.130
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things are starting to change.</v>

205
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:41.053
<v Speaker 1>A lot of self driven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youngsters have been educated in Europe </v>

206
00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:43.664
<v Speaker 1>or America and now they are coming back </v>
<v Speaker 1>to their country of origin with a new </v>

207
00:10:46.881 --> 00:10:48.410
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more critical mindset,</v>

208
00:10:49.020 --> 00:10:49.853
<v Speaker 1>more entrepreneurial spirits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This generation is creating the rates </v>

209
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.623
<v Speaker 1>for a startup ecosystem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is still a lot of work to be </v>

210
00:11:01.110 --> 00:11:02.700
<v Speaker 1>anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether you like as an ot,</v>

211
00:11:02.701 --> 00:11:07.290
<v Speaker 1>we must admit that this top down model </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been successful in South Korea lines</v>

212
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.530
<v Speaker 1>of all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are still some questions that must</v>

213
00:11:10.531 --> 00:11:11.364
<v Speaker 1>be onset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happened if a country like </v>

214
00:11:12.481 --> 00:11:13.314
<v Speaker 1>Samsung collapsed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen to the country as a </v>

215
00:11:14.761 --> 00:11:15.594
<v Speaker 1>whole and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this marriage between politics and </v>

216
00:11:18.061 --> 00:11:22.620
<v Speaker 1>business has created lots of incentives </v>
<v Speaker 1>for corruption on a massive scale,</v>

217
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:24.900
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover in a future video.</v>

218
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:30.673
<v Speaker 1>You should absolutely check out this </v>
<v Speaker 1>other video we made about the rising </v>

219

<v Speaker 1>Asian middle class and also do not </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget to check out.</v>

221
00:11:38.601 --> 00:11:39.970
<v Speaker 1>That isn't my voice on this</v>

222
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:43.400
<v Speaker 2>videos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I was.</v>

223
00:11:43.430 --> 00:11:44.390
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>

224
00:11:44.391 --> 00:11:48.440
<v Speaker 1>do you think that this crossover between</v>
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy and the free market could ever</v>

225
00:11:48.441 --> 00:11:49.274
<v Speaker 1>work in other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's your opinion about the South </v>

226

<v Speaker 1>Korean system?</v>
