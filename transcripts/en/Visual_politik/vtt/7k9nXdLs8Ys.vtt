00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

2
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.240
<v Speaker 1>the country where the far right wing as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is known today,</v>

3
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:14.330
<v Speaker 1>was born way before the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

4
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.010
<v Speaker 1>way before Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the game,</v>

5
00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:18.850
<v Speaker 1>the presidents of the United States way </v>
<v Speaker 1>before breakfast,</v>

6
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:21.230
<v Speaker 1>and the uprising of xenophobic parties </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe.</v>

7
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.363
<v Speaker 1>Way before all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France have an extreme nationalist </v>

8
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.800
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Front,</v>

9
00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.110
<v Speaker 1>and this had a real chance to winning on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light.</v>

10
00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:30.983
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

11
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:34.690
<v Speaker 1>Julie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2002,</v>

12
00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:35.524
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the political players in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country from the left to the sense of </v>

13
00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:43.471
<v Speaker 1>rice had to join forces just to keep it </v>
<v Speaker 1>from becoming the president of France.</v>

14
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.680
<v Speaker 1>In April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 French people are going back to the</v>

15
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:48.514
<v Speaker 1>voting stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people think that this is the </v>

16
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.160
<v Speaker 1>ultimate chance for the far right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>

17
00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:58.720
<v Speaker 1>The moments where the national front </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Marine Le Pen as its leader can get</v>

18
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.360
<v Speaker 1>the presidential office once and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

19
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>if this was the case of Marine Le Pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who by the way is the daughter of Marine</v>

20
00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.183
<v Speaker 1>Le Pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has promise that she will do everything </v>

21
00:01:07.211 --> 00:01:08.044
<v Speaker 1>she can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you take a country out of the </v>

22
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 1>European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

23
00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.890
<v Speaker 1>France is the second largest country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>continental Europe.</v>

24
00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Victory for the extreme rights would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>a triumph for all far right parties.</v>

25
00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.253
<v Speaker 2>Consonants</v>

26
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.253
<v Speaker 1>do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wait one minute because the </v>

27
00:01:26.101 --> 00:01:30.000
<v Speaker 1>question is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does Marine Le Pen have a real chance of</v>

28
00:01:30.001 --> 00:01:30.834
<v Speaker 1>winning this election?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there anyone out there who could </v>

29
00:01:32.671 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>possibly stop her?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today?</v>

30
00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.070
<v Speaker 1>We are going to answer all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions and we're going to get to know</v>

31
00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 1>in depth history of the French extreme.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Write a story that includes wars,</v>

32
00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>ego clashes,</v>

33
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.950
<v Speaker 3>well playmates.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's get into it</v>

34
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:51.610
<v Speaker 1>and clap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The French.</v>

35
00:01:51.611 --> 00:01:54.670
<v Speaker 1>Extreme rights has to ideological </v>
<v Speaker 1>grandparents,</v>

36
00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:58.060
<v Speaker 1>adult pit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My ends theo a s as you know,</v>

37
00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 1>during World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Germans invaded the north of France,</v>

38
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.410
<v Speaker 1>the south,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called free zone,</v>

39
00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:09.920
<v Speaker 1>who's capital was vishy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was governed by French politicians being</v>

40
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>supported at the German national </v>
<v Speaker 1>socialism.</v>

41
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.243
<v Speaker 1>When the war ends in the new president </v>
<v Speaker 1>general Charles de Gaulle executed the </v>

42
00:02:16.251 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>main officials from vishy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do wait one minute again,</v>

43
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:19.814
<v Speaker 1>because there were many people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported this collaborationist </v>

44
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:25.080
<v Speaker 1>government people even without having </v>
<v Speaker 1>political power,</v>

45
00:02:25.081 --> 00:02:25.914
<v Speaker 1>it held the same principles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends the same ideals as the national </v>

46
00:02:28.731 --> 00:02:33.731
<v Speaker 1>socialists for Nazi Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of them were in the army up in 1961</v>

47
00:02:37.921 --> 00:02:39.900
<v Speaker 1>the French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's their most precious colony.</v>

48
00:02:39.901 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>Algeria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>old,</v>

49
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.830
<v Speaker 1>a self determination referendum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

50
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.664
<v Speaker 1>this was not great news for all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>far right extremists inside the French </v>

51
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.740
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how the OAS was born.</v>

52
00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:50.693
<v Speaker 1>The oes was a terrorist group.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His main goal was to ends the Algeria </v>

53
00:02:53.751 --> 00:02:55.350
<v Speaker 1>and attempt to the independence.</v>

54
00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.130
<v Speaker 3>We are not terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you understand?</v>

55
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 3>We have Patrick.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I would do what you used to the soldiers</v>

56
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.000
<v Speaker 3>who died fighting in Algeria and do the </v>
<v Speaker 3>3 million French citizens.</v>

57
00:03:04.001 --> 00:03:04.840
<v Speaker 3>What?</v>
<v Speaker 3>What was it there?</v>

58
00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.080
<v Speaker 1>So did they succeed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually no.</v>

59
00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>In 1962,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Algeria became a sovereign state.</v>

60
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.063
<v Speaker 1>And then the OAS change their goals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to kill the French president </v>

61
00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.230
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They thought that the goal was a traitor</v>

62
00:03:17.231 --> 00:03:18.870
<v Speaker 1>to France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately though,</v>

63
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:19.773
<v Speaker 1>in 1965,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French police dismantled the last </v>

64
00:03:21.581 --> 00:03:22.414
<v Speaker 1>cells of this group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like what happens after the end of </v>

65
00:03:24.101 --> 00:03:24.934
<v Speaker 1>World War II,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they jailing the hardliners didn't mean </v>

66
00:03:26.951 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>there were no people supporting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general court.</v>

67
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.940
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

68
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.943
<v Speaker 1>The country of liberty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>equality and fraternity has a large </v>

69
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:42.130
<v Speaker 1>amounts of people who hated the Algerian</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to have for the Third Reich,</v>

70
00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>and this was the foundation that Joel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Marine Le Pen used to bills.</v>

71
00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Ten years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Front's,</v>

72
00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:54.210
<v Speaker 1>so you only talk about the war over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>over everyday we're reminded of what was</v>

73
00:03:56.621 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 1>the war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the persecution of the Jews,</v>

74
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.020
<v Speaker 1>the excessive behavior of the occupying </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

75
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 1>And so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The beginning of this policy was no easy</v>

76
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.100
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the 19 seventies,</v>

77
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:09.700
<v Speaker 1>the National Front's would never get </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than five percent of the votes,</v>

78
00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:13.510
<v Speaker 1>and Marie Le Pen himself suffered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist attack at his own house.</v>

79
00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.403
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this though is when the really good pot </v>

80
00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:16.954
<v Speaker 1>stocks in 1977,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the Le Pen family inherited </v>

81
00:04:19.931 --> 00:04:22.840
<v Speaker 1>from a fellow support and entire palace.</v>

82
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:27.923
<v Speaker 1>It was the palace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon this would become the unofficial </v>

83
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.074
<v Speaker 1>headquarters for the National Front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as we probably could just say the </v>

84
00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:35.760
<v Speaker 1>lappin family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

85
00:04:35.761 --> 00:04:40.761
<v Speaker 1>My friends with this policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything does stay in family drama,</v>

86
00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:44.253
<v Speaker 1>reorganized all those electoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns that need and the third </v>

87
00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>biggest political force in France at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the 1980,</v>

88
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:50.903
<v Speaker 1>while his daughter Marine Le Pen was </v>
<v Speaker 1>following him and learning the secrets </v>

89
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.000
<v Speaker 1>as the art of politics in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the leader that she is today.</v>

90
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:59.250
<v Speaker 1>Lisa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his granddaughter,</v>

91
00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:00.140
<v Speaker 1>Mary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the pen,</v>

92
00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160
<v Speaker 1>would follow him too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and she is now an MD in French Polynesia</v>

93
00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.440
<v Speaker 1>and a rising star in the national front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly though,</v>

94
00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.330
<v Speaker 1>even though his party congratulates in </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the champion of family values,</v>

95
00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:13.360
<v Speaker 1>Le Pen's family is far from a happy one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

96
00:05:13.361 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I didn't know here visual politic.</v>

97
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:16.870
<v Speaker 1>We really don't like to gossip about </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

98
00:05:16.871 --> 00:05:17.704
<v Speaker 1>but in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's kinds of absolutely necessary to </v>

99
00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:21.850
<v Speaker 1>understand the political life.</v>

100
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.350
<v Speaker 1>As I said in the 19 eighties zone Marine</v>
<v Speaker 1>Le Pen,</v>

101
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:33.910
<v Speaker 1>who we will now called Le Pen senior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was on fire in every election.</v>

102
00:05:33.911 --> 00:05:36.040
<v Speaker 1>He was getting more and more votes than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous one.</v>

103
00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:36.903
<v Speaker 1>It was during this time that he decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>to hiring journalists to write his own </v>

104
00:05:40.361 --> 00:05:41.194
<v Speaker 1>biography,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course you know this random list </v>

105
00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.313
<v Speaker 1>palace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can you guess what this journalist </v>

106
00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.631
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:05:50.631 --> 00:05:54.740
<v Speaker 1>he probably can't unless you already </v>
<v Speaker 1>know he seduced Le Pen's wife.</v>

108
00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not just that these lovers then</v>

109
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.200
<v Speaker 1>runaway from the palace,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then months later,</v>

110
00:06:00.201 --> 00:06:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Mrs Levin was on the cover of French </v>
<v Speaker 1>Playboy magazine,</v>

111
00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>and this is how the whole world </v>
<v Speaker 1>discovered the more sensible side of the</v>

112
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:08.924
<v Speaker 1>experience</v>

113
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:11.300
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

114
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.840
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This caused a split in the family.</v>

115
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.450
<v Speaker 1>No matter how good the father was </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing in the elections,</v>

116
00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>his daughter still agree with more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more distant from him,</v>

117
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.270
<v Speaker 1>but the real turning point in the law </v>
<v Speaker 1>and family would come in the year 2002.</v>

118
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.200
<v Speaker 1>This was a year when France happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Presidential elections and for the first</v>

119
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:38.350
<v Speaker 1>time in history or Le Pen went to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second round.</v>

120
00:06:41.780 --> 00:06:42.511
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might know,</v>

121
00:06:42.511 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>the French Alex oral system has two </v>
<v Speaker 1>routes.</v>

122
00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:47.030
<v Speaker 1>When you're choosing presidents in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first rounds,</v>

123
00:06:47.031 --> 00:06:49.070
<v Speaker 1>they can choose from all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates,</v>

124
00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.933
<v Speaker 1>however many that may be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the second round you can only </v>

125
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>vote for the two most successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates in the first rounds,</v>

126
00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:55.443
<v Speaker 1>well in 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones who made it into the second </v>

127
00:06:57.351 --> 00:06:58.184
<v Speaker 1>round was Jacques Chirac from the Center</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right Wing Party and Lapan senior from </v>

128
00:07:01.701 --> 00:07:02.490
<v Speaker 1>the extreme</v>

129
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:03.323
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

130
00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.260
<v Speaker 1>now you might be wondering how did it </v>
<v Speaker 1>happen to do it too,</v>

131
00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:13.120
<v Speaker 1>right wing candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the new rules in France.</v>

132
00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:13.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the easiest Le Pen learned an </v>

133
00:07:15.191 --> 00:07:19.430
<v Speaker 1>important lesson in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the captain boats out.</v>

134
00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.533
<v Speaker 1>I thought that this is going to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>some principles of the party attractive </v>

135
00:07:23.350 --> 00:07:25.960
<v Speaker 1>no matter where they stand on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>political spectrum,</v>

136
00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but ben stood for protectionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French companies,</v>

137
00:07:28.421 --> 00:07:29.254
<v Speaker 1>but also for French workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the America first thing </v>

138
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:33.220
<v Speaker 1>that trump was going on about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

139
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:34.054
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that's not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's invention was used buying the </v>

140
00:07:35.951 --> 00:07:36.784
<v Speaker 1>pen in the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so incidentals and into industrial </v>

141
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:40.150
<v Speaker 1>cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I'll say,</v>

142
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:43.860
<v Speaker 1>who used to be left wing strongholds </v>
<v Speaker 1>voted for the national front.</v>

143
00:07:43.861 --> 00:07:48.861
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why in that second rounds,</v>

144
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:53.580
<v Speaker 1>boozy remains loyal to the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic party,</v>

145
00:07:53.730 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 1>had to swallow their pride and vote for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chirac and the center reits candidates,</v>

146
00:07:58.440 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean anything was better than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>uprising of a racist,</v>

147
00:08:01.021 --> 00:08:01.854
<v Speaker 1>extreme conservative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Likely the Penn family learns a second </v>

148
00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:11.304
<v Speaker 1>important lesson in politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not only important to be accepted </v>

149
00:08:14.371 --> 00:08:18.000
<v Speaker 1>by your own voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you also can't be too scary to the other</v>

150
00:08:18.001 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If your opposition are too frightened,</v>

151
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:21.193
<v Speaker 1>they might join forces to prevent you </v>
<v Speaker 1>from getting into that presidential </v>

152
00:08:23.781 --> 00:08:24.614
<v Speaker 1>palace</v>

153
00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:28.933
<v Speaker 1>versus Sean Murray versus Merry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Christmas was not a great time for the </v>

154
00:08:32.451 --> 00:08:33.980
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After 2000 and see,</v>

155
00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>Marine Le Pen started out internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaign against a father.</v>

156
00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.433
<v Speaker 1>Now if again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jo Marie Le Pen was a politician that </v>

157
00:08:41.121 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>ran for elections with statements like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this</v>

158
00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:45.480
<v Speaker 2>to</v>

159
00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:49.350
<v Speaker 1>be an authority always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we believe that in a household,</v>

160
00:08:49.590 --> 00:08:52.140
<v Speaker 1>the best one to have this authority is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mat.</v>

161
00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marine Le Pen was a women ready,</v>

162
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.973
<v Speaker 1>have authority and modernize a political</v>
<v Speaker 1>party that would honestly make windows </v>

163
00:08:58.951 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>95 looked like a piece of state and </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond software.</v>

164
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:03.083
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike the other marine supported gay </v>

165
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:07.350
<v Speaker 1>civil unions and was against the death </v>
<v Speaker 1>penalty,</v>

166
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:11.010
<v Speaker 1>even National Front voters could </v>
<v Speaker 1>appreciate these changes and this is why</v>

167
00:09:11.070 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>in 2011 or the pen Jr took her father's </v>
<v Speaker 1>place as the party's leader,</v>

168
00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.610
<v Speaker 1>but do not think that things were that </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy.</v>

169
00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:23.000
<v Speaker 1>I wonder what motivated marine and her </v>
<v Speaker 1>deputy is in this offensive.</v>

170
00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.330
<v Speaker 1>They have launched against me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just that joint.</v>

171
00:09:25.820 --> 00:09:26.653
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it when you've been the</v>
<v Speaker 1>founder and the leader of a French far </v>

172
00:09:29.511 --> 00:09:30.344
<v Speaker 1>right political party for 39 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to be easy taking orders </v>

173
00:09:33.711 --> 00:09:34.700
<v Speaker 1>from your daughter.</v>

174
00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:35.593
<v Speaker 1>So even though today's y'all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marie Le Pen is the honorary president </v>

175
00:09:37.881 --> 00:09:38.714
<v Speaker 1>of the National Front,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also votes as an independence at the </v>

176
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.680
<v Speaker 1>European Parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I campaigned not from a renal Le Pen,</v>

177
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:46.683
<v Speaker 1>but for Joan Marie Le Pen and I want 33 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and guess this main supporter </v>

178
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:51.860
<v Speaker 1>inside of the family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surprise,</v>

179
00:09:51.861 --> 00:09:52.910
<v Speaker 1>surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Family business.</v>

180
00:09:52.911 --> 00:09:54.440
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says granddaughter,</v>

181
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:58.260
<v Speaker 1>married Le Pen who is starting her own </v>
<v Speaker 1>battle against her arms.</v>

182
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Murray,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's a provocateur,</v>

183
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.360
<v Speaker 1>an nt conformist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't always nice to hear.</v>

184
00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.433
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marines moderation in combination with </v>

185
00:10:07.881 --> 00:10:08.714
<v Speaker 1>the end of the crisis in France all </v>
<v Speaker 1>working way better than the radical </v>

186
00:10:11.301 --> 00:10:12.134
<v Speaker 1>strategies have a fall back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I consider Europe has made a mistake in </v>

187
00:10:17.891 --> 00:10:18.724
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They should've started cooperation and </v>

188
00:10:20.801 --> 00:10:21.634
<v Speaker 1>development relationships with Africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>this way they would have fixed the </v>

189
00:10:24.521 --> 00:10:26.980
<v Speaker 1>people in their own countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

190
00:10:26.981 --> 00:10:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the latest holsters for this 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>election give her close to 25 percent of</v>

191
00:10:31.631 --> 00:10:32.860
<v Speaker 1>the vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes sense.</v>

192
00:10:32.890 --> 00:10:37.120
<v Speaker 1>The first or second biggest candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in an election with five candidates,</v>

193
00:10:37.150 --> 00:10:37.983
<v Speaker 1>25 percent is a big thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is always certain that she will make </v>

194
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:45.070
<v Speaker 1>it into the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do consider that just because she is</v>

195
00:10:45.071 --> 00:10:45.904
<v Speaker 1>less radical than her father.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean that marine is a </v>

196
00:10:48.131 --> 00:10:49.630
<v Speaker 1>moderate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

197
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:50.523
<v Speaker 1>far from it,</v>

198
00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:59.070
<v Speaker 1>they missed 144 points of our electoral </v>
<v Speaker 1>manifesto.</v>

199
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:03.210
<v Speaker 1>Lappin dreamier stands for closing </v>
<v Speaker 1>frontiers of massive deportations,</v>

200
00:11:03.300 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 1>the exit of the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the return of the French currency,</v>

201
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:12.730
<v Speaker 1>the same economic views as Vladimir </v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin.</v>

202
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:16.030
<v Speaker 1>This is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is nothing new either.</v>

203
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.180
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so enough.</v>

204
00:11:17.190 --> 00:11:18.850
<v Speaker 1>You're probably now wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:11:18.851 --> 00:11:21.940
<v Speaker 1>Cam lappin actually become the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>president of France,</v>

206
00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:25.240
<v Speaker 1>so let's address this question with </v>
<v Speaker 1>another question.</v>

207
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Can Stop for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The center right wing in France,</v>

208
00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.710
<v Speaker 1>Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good steal them,</v>

209
00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:34.593
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that a big share of the </v>

210
00:11:37.010 --> 00:11:38.520
<v Speaker 1>National Front's votes come from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>left wing,</v>

211
00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.533
<v Speaker 1>but in a time of crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family values and anti immigrant </v>

212
00:11:42.001 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 1>sentiments are particularly attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>to conservative voters.</v>

213
00:11:45.630 --> 00:11:48.670
<v Speaker 1>So in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big party of the center writes,</v>

214
00:11:48.690 --> 00:11:49.523
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans chose a candidate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also put forward some of the </v>

215
00:11:52.501 --> 00:11:56.670
<v Speaker 1>proposals that made famous viceman was </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francois.</v>

216
00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:04.133
<v Speaker 1>So is the strategy working well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently not since finial became the </v>

217
00:12:08.771 --> 00:12:11.050
<v Speaker 1>party's candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republicans have been falling on the</v>

218
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:11.884
<v Speaker 1>polls and they are now fighting for </v>
<v Speaker 1>third position with the far right wing </v>

219
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:16.660
<v Speaker 1>party of Luke Menand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shore corruption,</v>

220
00:12:16.661 --> 00:12:17.494
<v Speaker 1>sex scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the fact that people prefer the </v>

221
00:12:18.611 --> 00:12:19.444
<v Speaker 1>original to the copy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has caused failure and the center </v>

222
00:12:21.641 --> 00:12:23.010
<v Speaker 1>right to fall into it,</v>

223
00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.270
<v Speaker 1>but there is still hope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The battle is not over.</v>

224
00:12:29.271 --> 00:12:31.820
<v Speaker 1>There is still a man who could be ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop.</v>

225
00:12:31.821 --> 00:12:32.654
<v Speaker 1>Le Pen's hurricane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is Emmanuel macron and he was </v>

226
00:12:35.151 --> 00:12:37.760
<v Speaker 1>the finance minister during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments of Manwell vowels.</v>

227
00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so is Emmanuel macron a socialist?</v>

228
00:12:44.590 --> 00:12:47.820
<v Speaker 1>Elmo macron is running in the elections </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an independent,</v>

229
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.833
<v Speaker 1>even manual vowels himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't support him in public until </v>

230
00:12:50.911 --> 00:12:53.810
<v Speaker 1>relatively recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does Emmanuel macron stand?</v>

231
00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.990
<v Speaker 1>Basically he stands for the opposite of</v>

232
00:13:03.560 --> 00:13:04.393
<v Speaker 1>Macron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to ends the privileges and </v>

233
00:13:05.601 --> 00:13:06.434
<v Speaker 1>subsidies that French companies guess he</v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to end the barriers that made it </v>

234
00:13:09.081 --> 00:13:11.120
<v Speaker 1>impossible for the French youth to get a</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

235
00:13:11.270 --> 00:13:14.750
<v Speaker 1>And of course he is against </v>
<v Speaker 1>discrimination based on race or religion</v>

236
00:13:14.810 --> 00:13:15.643
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be a champion for deficit </v>

237
00:13:17.811 --> 00:13:20.600
<v Speaker 1>reduction as fiscal responsibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam does.</v>

238
00:13:20.601 --> 00:13:21.434
<v Speaker 1>If that was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of his proposals is to forbid high </v>

239
00:13:23.781 --> 00:13:24.614
<v Speaker 1>ranking officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do employee their own family in salina </v>

240
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:27.563
<v Speaker 1>be administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see is the antithesis of </v>

241
00:13:30.051 --> 00:13:30.884
<v Speaker 1>Marine Le Pen and surprise surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the latest polls actually indicate that </v>

242
00:13:33.441 --> 00:13:35.810
<v Speaker 1>he is slightly more popular than Marine </v>
<v Speaker 1>Le Pen.</v>

243
00:13:35.950 --> 00:13:36.783
<v Speaker 1>We'd like the 25 percent of the expected</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of this despite being an </v>

244
00:13:45.231 --> 00:13:46.064
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So he has a high chance of being the </v>

245
00:13:47.651 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>person that Le Pen will face in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second round,</v>

246
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.013
<v Speaker 1>maybe not because there is a last </v>
<v Speaker 1>variable that we must consider and </v>

247
00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.010
<v Speaker 1>that's extension.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if macron has a lot of supporters,</v>

248
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:08.640
<v Speaker 1>they are simply not as motivated as </v>
<v Speaker 1>those from the Japan side.</v>

249
00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:10.860
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if during the second rounds,</v>

250
00:14:10.890 --> 00:14:11.723
<v Speaker 1>the National Front could retain 90 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of their boats and macron could </v>

251
00:14:14.371 --> 00:14:15.204
<v Speaker 1>only retain 40 or 50 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would have great difficulty winning </v>

252
00:14:18.331 --> 00:14:18.890
<v Speaker 1>the presence.</v>

253
00:14:18.890 --> 00:14:19.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

254
00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.540
<v Speaker 1>but I mean this is just our opinion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic and we would love to hear</v>

255
00:14:27.541 --> 00:14:30.060
<v Speaker 1>yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think macron can be in the pen in</v>

256
00:14:30.061 --> 00:14:30.894
<v Speaker 1>France?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are there any other candidates that </v>

257
00:14:31.921 --> 00:14:34.350
<v Speaker 1>could make a surprise resurgence during </v>
<v Speaker 1>the election?</v>
