<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.453
<v Speaker 2>in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to take a look at the </v>

3
00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:15.070
<v Speaker 2>career of one of the most surprising and</v>
<v Speaker 2>controversial figures of the century.</v>

4
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:20.130
<v Speaker 2>The figure is Mikhail Saakashvili.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait a second,</v>

5
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.100
<v Speaker 2>you don't know him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

6
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.480
<v Speaker 2>imagine a person who is capable of being</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the best allies of Washington and</v>

7
00:00:38.481 --> 00:00:42.350
<v Speaker 2>at the same time one of the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 2>enemies of flatten map Putin.</v>

8
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.243
<v Speaker 2>He was president of one country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a candidate to preside over another and </v>

9
00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.650
<v Speaker 2>today beat doesn't even have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationality.</v>

10
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.513
<v Speaker 2>This is a man how politician worthy of </v>
<v Speaker 2>starring and his very own political </v>

11
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:57.510
<v Speaker 2>thriller.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

12
00:00:57.511 --> 00:00:58.344
<v Speaker 2>I would imagine they probably wouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>be surprising to see a netflix original </v>

13
00:01:00.391 --> 00:01:01.530
<v Speaker 2>produced about this guy</v>

14
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

15
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 2>This is today's character for visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic.</v>

16
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.740
<v Speaker 2>It is Mikhail Saakashvili.</v>

17
00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.203
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a</v>

18
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.650
<v Speaker 2>be shoved the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does it start our story?</v>

19
00:01:23.651 --> 00:01:28.651
<v Speaker 2>We need to go back to maybe the 30th </v>
<v Speaker 2>2015 but that's a petro Poroshenko.</v>

20
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:29.584
<v Speaker 2>The president of Ukraine appointed may </v>
<v Speaker 2>coming Elsa Cash Villi as the governor </v>

21
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.150
<v Speaker 2>of the province of a Dessa.</v>

22
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>With it</v>

23
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:39.040
<v Speaker 2>position Misha was given Ukrainian </v>
<v Speaker 2>nationality.</v>

24
00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:40.960
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to becoming Ukrainian citizen,</v>

25
00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:43.630
<v Speaker 2>he had to give up citizenship from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>home country,</v>

26
00:01:43.631 --> 00:01:44.464
<v Speaker 2>Georgia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country he had led US president </v>

27
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:48.310
<v Speaker 2>between 2004 and 2013</v>

28
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:50.743
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

29
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.570
<v Speaker 2>Addition to the Ukrainian government was</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite the treat for the media band.</v>

30
00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's only logical.</v>

31
00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:57.993
<v Speaker 2>You see at that time your crane was </v>
<v Speaker 2>going through a really tense situation </v>

32
00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 2>after the circled maidan revolution and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fall of pro Russian President Viktor</v>

33
00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:06.813
<v Speaker 2>Yanukovych.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was almost a feeling of civil war </v>

34
00:02:07.841 --> 00:02:08.674
<v Speaker 2>in Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a war between Kiev supporters and </v>

35
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.173
<v Speaker 2>supporters of Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Odessa was one of the most pro </v>

36
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:14.434
<v Speaker 2>Russian provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you can imagine the picture of the </v>

37
00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 2>foreign ex presidents and not just any </v>
<v Speaker 2>ex president,</v>

38
00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:22.300
<v Speaker 2>but what of Putin's worst enemies </v>
<v Speaker 2>appointed as the governor of a,</v>

39
00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:23.403
<v Speaker 2>this event was hugely discussed in all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the national media as well as the </v>

40
00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 2>international press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of Ukraine,</v>

41
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:30.010
<v Speaker 2>who was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

42
00:02:30.011 --> 00:02:32.860
<v Speaker 2>in old friends and fellow college </v>
<v Speaker 2>students of meshes,</v>

43
00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:33.694
<v Speaker 2>Petro Poroshenko.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Describe to Misha as the man who makes </v>

44
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:38.920
<v Speaker 2>possible the impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty flattering,</v>

45
00:02:38.921 --> 00:02:39.754
<v Speaker 2>right at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their friendship when it seemed </v>

46
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.340
<v Speaker 2>bulletproof.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

47
00:02:42.341 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 2>the mission of the new governor was to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stabilize a dessa grounds power to Kiev,</v>

48
00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:47.793
<v Speaker 2>chase corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and sets the groundwork for the region </v>

49
00:02:49.751 --> 00:02:54.751
<v Speaker 2>to prosper in order to carry it all out </v>
<v Speaker 2>to make sure.</v>

50
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.040
<v Speaker 2>Brought in many of his former </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborators from Georgia.</v>

51
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.860
<v Speaker 2>He also hired many young professionals </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be thought to be corruption free like</v>

52
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.830
<v Speaker 2>Yulia and Mary chef's got an activist </v>
<v Speaker 2>who became famous here on Youtube.</v>

53
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 2>But with the video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I am a Ukrainian.</v>

54
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.970
<v Speaker 2>Misha also brought in some people from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Putin's opposition in Russia,</v>

55
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.863
<v Speaker 2>like the Russian activist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maria guider who was appointed vice </v>

56
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:17.370
<v Speaker 2>governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

57
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.203
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

58
00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.810
<v Speaker 2>That was a lot to do and it had to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>done fast,</v>

59
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.520
<v Speaker 2>so wow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As it was sad.</v>

60
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.560
<v Speaker 2>So it was done.</v>

61
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.560
<v Speaker 1>One</v>

62
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.040
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took the Odessa governorship.</v>

63
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:36.390
<v Speaker 2>The new governor started a thorough </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation to find and punish corrupt</v>

64
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.283
<v Speaker 2>public workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He changed most of the high level </v>

65
00:03:38.911 --> 00:03:42.450
<v Speaker 2>positions in the public administration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's simplified the process for creating</v>

66
00:03:42.451 --> 00:03:43.284
<v Speaker 2>companies and introduced independent </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls and even liberated public </v>

67
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:47.243
<v Speaker 2>beaches that had been illegally occupied</v>
<v Speaker 2>so that once again Adesa citizens joy </v>

68
00:03:50.791 --> 00:03:51.624
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second tier because Misha has </v>

69
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:58.680
<v Speaker 2>a strange work methodology and it is as </v>
<v Speaker 2>effective as it is controversial.</v>

70
00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>If anything doesn't work properly and </v>
<v Speaker 2>does corrupt,</v>

71
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.273
<v Speaker 2>he just dismantles it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He fires all the workers and he sets it </v>

72
00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:05.904
<v Speaker 2>up again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did the same during his time in </v>

73
00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:08.124
<v Speaker 2>office in Georgia with the traffic </v>
<v Speaker 2>police anti threatened to do it again </v>

74
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:13.890
<v Speaker 2>with the Odessa port,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the largest commercial port in Ukraine,</v>

75
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 2>well known for bribes and payments to </v>
<v Speaker 2>customs officers.</v>

76
00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.400
<v Speaker 2>You need to fire them all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have 130 new people.</v>

77
00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:21.263
<v Speaker 2>They are young,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new and trained and the old ones are </v>

78
00:04:22.741 --> 00:04:23.574
<v Speaker 2>hopeless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Calls Saakashvili in the end though </v>

79
00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:26.373
<v Speaker 2>here and you have to follow some of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>customs officers so that the corruption </v>

80
00:04:28.291 --> 00:04:29.730
<v Speaker 2>would stop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Consider this.</v>

81
00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.840
<v Speaker 2>A number of businessmen noted that </v>
<v Speaker 2>bribes at the port really had stopped in</v>

82
00:04:33.841 --> 00:04:34.674
<v Speaker 2>recent months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mainly because people were scared of </v>

83
00:04:36.181 --> 00:04:37.014
<v Speaker 2>becoming the next victim of one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>soccer stability is public </v>

84
00:04:38.971 --> 00:04:41.820
<v Speaker 2>anticorruption tirades rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shawn Walker,</v>

85
00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:45.690
<v Speaker 2>correspondent of the Guardian with all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these changes and with the help of me,</v>

86
00:04:45.691 --> 00:04:46.524
<v Speaker 2>she has contacts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>ADESA started to receive help from the </v>

87
00:04:48.811 --> 00:04:51.240
<v Speaker 2>USA and since we should didn't trust the</v>
<v Speaker 2>police,</v>

88
00:04:51.241 --> 00:04:52.074
<v Speaker 2>the first thing he did was establish an </v>
<v Speaker 2>independent police force to fight </v>

89
00:04:54.691 --> 00:04:55.524
<v Speaker 2>corruption.</v>

90
00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:57.993
<v Speaker 1>One</v>

91
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.863
<v Speaker 2>has a police force that was organized </v>
<v Speaker 2>and trained by the FBI and the </v>

92
00:05:01.841 --> 00:05:02.674
<v Speaker 2>California Highway Patrol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it looks like everything was going </v>

93
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:06.670
<v Speaker 2>pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

94
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.440
<v Speaker 2>Well just hold on a second because both </v>
<v Speaker 2>sac is really and his team soon realized</v>

95
00:05:11.441 --> 00:05:14.620
<v Speaker 2>that it was going to be much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much harder than they anticipated.</v>

96
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:15.483
<v Speaker 2>The problem was that Odessa was not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>battlefield of Kiev supporters versus </v>

97
00:05:18.941 --> 00:05:19.774
<v Speaker 2>pro Russians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was a battlefield between the </v>

98
00:05:21.311 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 2>rule of law and an oligarchy that has </v>
<v Speaker 2>dominated Ukraine at,</v>

99
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:29.780
<v Speaker 2>since it's independence kingdom of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the guards,</v>

100
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.903
<v Speaker 2>more and more experts have said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so your cranes biggest problem is not a </v>

101
00:05:41.861 --> 00:05:42.694
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is the oligarchy corruption in </v>

102
00:05:44.581 --> 00:05:45.414
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine is so embedded that we could </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost say it is a sort of feudal </v>

103
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:52.180
<v Speaker 2>country where the nobility or of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>these mighty oligarchy</v>

104
00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:56.150
<v Speaker 1>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They</v>

105
00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:58.490
<v Speaker 2>control the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political power,</v>

106
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 2>the administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the media,</v>

107
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:01.333
<v Speaker 2>almost nothing escapes that power which </v>
<v Speaker 2>is consolidated both by money and by </v>

108
00:06:05.481 --> 00:06:06.314
<v Speaker 2>fear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then level of impunity is almost </v>

109
00:06:07.911 --> 00:06:10.970
<v Speaker 2>absolute police,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government judges that all a part of the</v>

110
00:06:10.971 --> 00:06:11.804
<v Speaker 2>game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things have been this way since you </v>

111
00:06:12.851 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 2>crane got its independence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since the maidan revolution,</v>

112
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:16.573
<v Speaker 2>it's all got a whole lot worse after the</v>
<v Speaker 2>fall of the pro Russian president vixy </v>

113
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:22.724
<v Speaker 2>you knock a bitch and with the civil </v>
<v Speaker 2>conflict to the country was going </v>

114
00:06:24.771 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 2>through the new government felt </v>
<v Speaker 2>incapable of trusting the army,</v>

115
00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.190
<v Speaker 2>all the police.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since both institutions were corrupt,</v>

116
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.500
<v Speaker 2>they were disorganized and they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>badly equipped.</v>

117
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:34.363
<v Speaker 2>That is why he made a decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He appointed several oligarchs is </v>

118
00:06:36.981 --> 00:06:40.220
<v Speaker 2>governors of some of the most vulnerable</v>
<v Speaker 2>regions in the country.</v>

119
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 2>These oligarchs paid for that own </v>
<v Speaker 2>private armies and with nice incentives,</v>

120
00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.250
<v Speaker 2>the police followed their orders as </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

121
00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.040
<v Speaker 2>Earning a sum for the heads of every </v>
<v Speaker 2>separatist.</v>

122
00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:50.240
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as I told you,</v>

123
00:06:50.241 --> 00:06:51.074
<v Speaker 2>the government essentially placed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mafia directly in charge of several </v>

124
00:06:53.301 --> 00:06:54.280
<v Speaker 2>governorships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

125
00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:55.123
<v Speaker 2>that was the case for e Hok.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello Boyski who was appointed governor </v>

126
00:06:56.991 --> 00:06:57.824
<v Speaker 2>of Denise [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry if I'm screwing the </v>

127
00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:02.270
<v Speaker 2>pronunciation up on that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This took like 17 takes.</v>

128
00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.430
<v Speaker 2>This region is one of the most important</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the country.</v>

129
00:07:04.431 --> 00:07:06.110
<v Speaker 2>Economically speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So yes,</v>

130
00:07:06.140 --> 00:07:10.130
<v Speaker 2>this is the Ukraine Mikhail Saccos </v>
<v Speaker 2>philly was dealing with.</v>

131
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.503
<v Speaker 2>There was not a single state enterprise </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Ukraine that has not been usurped by </v>

132
00:07:14.421 --> 00:07:16.990
<v Speaker 2>one clan or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I verus Abramovic.</v>

133
00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.873
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>former minister of economy and trade of </v>

134
00:07:19.521 --> 00:07:20.900
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

135
00:07:20.901 --> 00:07:25.070
<v Speaker 2>all these oligarchs did not welcome </v>
<v Speaker 2>Misha or his reform agenda.</v>

136
00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:25.933
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>once he was even kicked out of an </v>

137
00:07:26.811 --> 00:07:30.380
<v Speaker 2>interview when he suggested all of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>mafia members have to be sent to prison,</v>

138
00:07:30.870 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 2>that the media is also the property of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the oligarchy.</v>

139
00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:34.843
<v Speaker 2>The thing is Misha soon started to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>to fight and ultimately ends the </v>

140
00:07:38.281 --> 00:07:39.114
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

141
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:44.443
<v Speaker 2>I will do whatever it takes for complete</v>
<v Speaker 2>victory to read new crane of this filth </v>

142
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.553
<v Speaker 2>of this corrupt scum which capitalize on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the blood of our soldiers whose only </v>

143
00:07:51.921 --> 00:07:54.350
<v Speaker 2>motivation in life is to fill its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>pockets,</v>

144
00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:57.500
<v Speaker 2>strengthen its own clan and bleed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine dry,</v>

145
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.393
<v Speaker 2>Mikhail Saakashvili and so he did Misha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It started to publicly report all kinds </v>

146
00:08:02.601 --> 00:08:03.434
<v Speaker 2>of influence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peddling favorable treatment and </v>

147
00:08:04.941 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 2>privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On one occasion he even came on national</v>

148
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:08.384
<v Speaker 2>television and reported the details that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they corrupt scheme of the airlines </v>

149
00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:11.953
<v Speaker 2>owned by column Boyski and oligarch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd nearly obtained a monopoly on </v>

150
00:08:14.661 --> 00:08:15.494
<v Speaker 2>national flights.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public reports ended the situation </v>

151
00:08:17.511 --> 00:08:19.330
<v Speaker 2>and took many of the people involved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>course.</v>

152
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>

153
00:08:20.721 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 2>Mr Colin [inaudible] didn't take it </v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

154
00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:24.103
<v Speaker 2>He promised to get his revenge and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here's what he said about satish </v>

155
00:08:26.131 --> 00:08:26.964
<v Speaker 2>civilian public.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When a dog without a muscle bite </v>

156
00:08:29.181 --> 00:08:30.014
<v Speaker 2>someone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we need to punish both the dog and more </v>

157
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:34.430
<v Speaker 2>importantly the owner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He Horror Calamos Ski.</v>

158
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:35.323
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dino thing that all Meesha did was </v>

159
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:38.320
<v Speaker 2>report the oligarchs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

160
00:08:41.670 --> 00:08:42.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

161
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:47.790
<v Speaker 2>train crash Saakashvili is reforms in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Odessa didn't complete the work.</v>

162
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:53.410
<v Speaker 2>Many of them were stops and sabotage by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the government in Kiev.</v>

163
00:08:53.470 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 2>This wasn't just the audio gox.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

164
00:08:55.321 --> 00:08:56.154
<v Speaker 2>corruption was so commonplace that it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was difficult to tell the difference </v>

165
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:00.800
<v Speaker 2>between the Mafia and the authority.</v>

166
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:05.543
<v Speaker 2>Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he didn't think twice the government </v>

167
00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:08.643
<v Speaker 2>became his target.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many analysts claim that this new war </v>

168
00:09:11.351 --> 00:09:14.680
<v Speaker 2>against the government had a hidden </v>
<v Speaker 2>agenda to take a leap.</v>

169
00:09:14.710 --> 00:09:16.450
<v Speaker 2>International politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

170
00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:17.740
<v Speaker 2>maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the thing is,</v>

171
00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:18.603
<v Speaker 2>he did it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started by reporting the corruption </v>

172
00:09:20.021 --> 00:09:20.854
<v Speaker 2>of the very prime minister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Our any Yatsenyuk man's many ministers </v>

173
00:09:23.411 --> 00:09:25.360
<v Speaker 2>followed this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Evil included his own friends.</v>

174
00:09:25.361 --> 00:09:29.050
<v Speaker 2>The president's Petro Poroshenko,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the person who had placed him in a Dasa.</v>

175
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.623
<v Speaker 2>What difference for Ukrainians does it </v>
<v Speaker 2>make who will treat them like dirt </v>

176
00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Poroshenko or you're kind of itch?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What difference?</v>

177
00:09:35.801 --> 00:09:38.230
<v Speaker 2>Who will steal from them?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mikhail Saakashvili,</v>

178
00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>the friendship that didn't last long as </v>
<v Speaker 2>we have seen Poroshenko appointed meesha</v>

179
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:45.730
<v Speaker 2>governor in May of 2015 in just a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The battle it,</v>

180
00:09:45.731 --> 00:09:45.880
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

181
00:09:45.880 --> 00:09:46.713
<v Speaker 1>Gone.</v>

182
00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:49.643
<v Speaker 2>Finally in November,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 at resigned as governor and began </v>

183
00:09:52.681 --> 00:09:53.514
<v Speaker 2>his own political party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The M N F I hadn't see soon gains more </v>

184
00:09:56.941 --> 00:09:59.070
<v Speaker 2>than 20,000 members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

185
00:09:59.190 --> 00:10:00.023
<v Speaker 2>The former Georgian presidents now </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to lead Ukraine and his own </v>

186
00:10:02.941 --> 00:10:03.601
<v Speaker 2>words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

187
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:04.434
<v Speaker 2>fine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To turn this disaster of a country into </v>

188
00:10:05.911 --> 00:10:07.450
<v Speaker 2>a complete European super.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.900
<v Speaker 2>Am I now be wondering about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>responsive Poroshenko ans the government</v>

190
00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:19.700
<v Speaker 2>to this campaign and pay close attention</v>
<v Speaker 2>here in July,</v>

191
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 2>2017 Poroshenko took advantage of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fact that there's a,</v>

192
00:10:21.841 --> 00:10:25.850
<v Speaker 2>Misha was in the USA and he revoked his </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukrainian citizenship.</v>

193
00:10:25.880 --> 00:10:26.713
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mikhail Saakashvili was a stateless </v>

194
00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:31.250
<v Speaker 2>person.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now if thing that stopped him,</v>

195
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>you are absolutely wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>

196
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:35.510
<v Speaker 2>when his nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was taken away.</v>

197
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:37.850
<v Speaker 2>Misha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he simply moved opponents and we have to</v>

198
00:10:37.851 --> 00:10:38.684
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle is a well loved guy in eastern </v>

199
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:40.700
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

200
00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:43.880
<v Speaker 2>many countries offered him citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nope bishop,</v>

201
00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:47.030
<v Speaker 2>he was determined to go back to Ukraine </v>
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>

202
00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:47.893
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what he did.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite the warnings of the government </v>

203
00:10:49.861 --> 00:10:52.970
<v Speaker 2>to give on September the 10th surrounded</v>
<v Speaker 2>by a supportive crowd.</v>

204
00:10:53.090 --> 00:10:56.840
<v Speaker 2>Michelle crossed the border on foot </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Poland and Ukraine.</v>

205
00:10:56.870 --> 00:10:59.450
<v Speaker 2>The images of his confrontation with the</v>
<v Speaker 2>border guards.</v>

206
00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.410
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're quite</v>

207
00:11:00.690 --> 00:11:01.523
<v Speaker 1>nice.</v>

208
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:23.920
<v Speaker 2>What do you think is up to now that he's</v>
<v Speaker 2>back despite his irregular situation?</v>

209
00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:26.050
<v Speaker 2>Nisha,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's campaigning around the country,</v>

210
00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:28.960
<v Speaker 2>but all of that said there is still an </v>
<v Speaker 2>important question.</v>

211
00:11:29.290 --> 00:11:31.540
<v Speaker 2>Why out [inaudible] Philly,</v>

212
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:36.623
<v Speaker 2>the Saakashvili Revolution in 2003 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Michelle at a popular uprising against </v>

213
00:11:42.421 --> 00:11:43.254
<v Speaker 2>the corrupt George and political system </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Eduard Shevardnadze and then what is </v>

214
00:11:46.321 --> 00:11:47.154
<v Speaker 2>known as the Rose Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He even made it to the Georgian </v>

215
00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:49.673
<v Speaker 2>parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Elections were held mans as the </v>

216
00:11:51.301 --> 00:11:54.960

<v Speaker 2>Nida Saakashvili easily beat the rest.</v>

217
00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:56.823
<v Speaker 2>The reform process that started there </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a fierce fight against corruption </v>

218
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:00.363
<v Speaker 2>and a tough policy towards Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That came to be a model for the former </v>

<v Speaker 2>Soviet countries.</v>
