1
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:08.273
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start off today's video by </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking you a question and please don't </v>

2
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:13.980
<v Speaker 1>Google it overwhelmed you just read the </v>
<v Speaker 1>title of the episode,</v>

3
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't really matter anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're betting for you didn't know,</v>

4
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.690
<v Speaker 1>but I can go into with the world's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive country and if you did well,</v>

5
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:22.780
<v Speaker 1>well done to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:24.240
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to expensive places to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live,</v>

7
00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>most people think of New York or Hong </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kong or is uric.</v>

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.090
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even close to right.</v>

9
00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:31.013
<v Speaker 1>The world's most expensive sitting is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Luanda the capital city of Angola and </v>

10
00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's an African</v>

11
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:37.870
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

12
00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:41.023
<v Speaker 1>So rented apartments in Luanda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can end up paying over $5,000 a </v>

13
00:00:43.891 --> 00:00:45.730
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How about the cost of a big Mac menu?</v>

14
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:46.730
<v Speaker 1>Mackey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ds,</v>

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.280
<v Speaker 1>well bounce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen American donors and if you want</v>

16
00:00:50.281 --> 00:00:51.114
<v Speaker 1>to have an internet connection at home,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you better hope you've got a </v>

17
00:00:53.161 --> 00:00:57.870
<v Speaker 1>healthy bank balance because that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to cost you around $300 a month.</v>

18
00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.250
<v Speaker 1>And they were not kidding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

19
00:00:59.251 --> 00:00:59.881
<v Speaker 1>so 91,</v>
<v Speaker 1>five.</v>

20
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:01.980
<v Speaker 1>You wondering what that was going on in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Angola?</v>

21
00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Is this some sort of extremely wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that.</v>

22
00:01:04.591 --> 00:01:09.591
<v Speaker 1>No one knows about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well No.</v>

23
00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:14.950
<v Speaker 1>The Republic of Angola is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's biggest oil exporters,</v>

24
00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.680
<v Speaker 1>surpassing other oil rich countries like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatar.</v>

25
00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.573
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of its population has no access to </v>

26
00:01:21.431 --> 00:01:21.850
<v Speaker 1>clean</v>

27
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:22.683
<v Speaker 2>modern.</v>

28
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.703
<v Speaker 1>Every three children suffer from </v>
<v Speaker 1>malnutrition and one out of every six </v>

29
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.620
<v Speaker 1>dies before reaching five years ago,</v>

30
00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.553
<v Speaker 2>a</v>

31
00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.803
<v Speaker 1>on the other ends of the spectrum and to</v>
<v Speaker 1>is home to one of the wealthiest women </v>

32
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.760
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be Isabelle dos Santos,</v>

33
00:01:45.761 --> 00:01:48.590
<v Speaker 1>who by the way is the daughter of former</v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents and Jay said,</v>

34
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.890
<v Speaker 1>sounds awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.940
<v Speaker 1>Might be figuring out what's going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

36
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.670
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go,</v>

37
00:01:59.671 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 1>La is one of the most corrupt countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planets.</v>

38
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.363
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was home to one of the biggest </v>

39
00:02:05.391 --> 00:02:06.224
<v Speaker 1>financial fiascos in reason years with </v>
<v Speaker 1>several companies losing billions of </v>

40
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:11.053
<v Speaker 1>dollars in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While perhaps this is no surprise to </v>

41
00:02:12.861 --> 00:02:14.450
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end of the day and go,</v>

42
00:02:14.451 --> 00:02:19.451
<v Speaker 1>there is still a third world country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

43
00:02:21.111 --> 00:02:24.170
<v Speaker 1>that is a question that must be asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

44
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 1>How did they get here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could the country possibly have such</v>

45
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:30.950
<v Speaker 1>a bizarre economy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And more importantly,</v>

46
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.843
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that the ruling party</v>
<v Speaker 1>managers to keep control of this </v>

47
00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:35.750
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:35.751 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer those </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

49
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>but first we do need to have a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

50
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.983
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

51
00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.733
<v Speaker 1>And diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First thing we need to understand when </v>

52
00:02:49.241 --> 00:02:50.074
<v Speaker 1>we talk about Africa is the most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>African countries were colonies in past </v>

53
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:55.023
<v Speaker 1>centuries.</v>

54
00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:59.223
<v Speaker 2>European</v>

55
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>like Belgium,</v>

56
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.173
<v Speaker 2>France and Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded and most of the continents </v>

57
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.203
<v Speaker 2>imposing rules and treating the natives </v>
<v Speaker 2>like animals and go to it wasn't an </v>

58
00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:12.040
<v Speaker 2>exception until 1975.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Portugal made a fortune with its diamond</v>

59
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.110
<v Speaker 2>mines in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

60
00:03:14.111 --> 00:03:16.960
<v Speaker 2>in that city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Portuguese government push to by the</v>

61
00:03:16.961 --> 00:03:21.160
<v Speaker 2>UN and its own people recognized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Gunas self determination.</v>

62
00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 2>And then the question was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens after a country stops being</v>

63
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.074
<v Speaker 2>a colony who takes care of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governmental affairs after the European </v>

64
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:30.123
<v Speaker 2>colonizers?</v>

65
00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:35.673
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of answering this question by </v>

66
00:03:37.211 --> 00:03:38.044
<v Speaker 1>calling for elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the many angerland trines created </v>

67
00:03:40.481 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>different from zen started the civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>war.</v>

68
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a conflict that then when's the</v>

69
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.390
<v Speaker 1>last 25 years?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there are still parts of the country</v>

70
00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:47.224
<v Speaker 1>today where you call them go because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're just covered in lamb's mind is </v>

71
00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.570
<v Speaker 1>in case you don't know what landmine is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is a bomb that you bury underground.</v>

72
00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Then when someone steps on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it explodes as well.</v>

73
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:57.573
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering how is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that such a poor country could </v>

74
00:03:59.711 --> 00:04:02.650
<v Speaker 1>afford all of these weapons and it was a</v>
<v Speaker 1>big long civil.</v>

75
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we almost have that one lies in the </v>

76
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:11.214
<v Speaker 1>diamonds that we previously mentioned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All signs of the conflict sold diamonds </v>

77
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:19.320
<v Speaker 1>and in exchange God arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we've provided these arms will often</v>

78
00:04:19.321 --> 00:04:20.011
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>76.</v>

79
00:04:20.011 --> 00:04:22.920
<v Speaker 1>When true civil war kicks off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were two sides.</v>

80
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.680
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was the units agreed who dominated</v>

81
00:04:25.681 --> 00:04:26.514
<v Speaker 1>the south of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>units that were supported by South </v>

82
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.890
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

83
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.020
<v Speaker 1>and to a lesser extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

84
00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:34.713
<v Speaker 1>the days of the Cold War and every war </v>
<v Speaker 1>in any parts of the globe was seen as a </v>

85
00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.300
<v Speaker 1>good opportunity to weaken Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

86
00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Plus it was known that Angola had oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves.</v>

87
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.560
<v Speaker 1>It's also explains why the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to take part in the conflict too.</v>

88
00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.610
<v Speaker 1>They were supporters of the Angolan </v>
<v Speaker 1>People's liberation movements or as they</v>

89
00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:53.080
<v Speaker 1>called it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the MPLA,</v>

90
00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:55.710
<v Speaker 1>but most of the world leader of the Mpla</v>
<v Speaker 1>was Josie,</v>

91
00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.100
<v Speaker 1>Eduardo dos Santos Santos did have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>support of the Soviet Union,</v>

92
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.053
<v Speaker 1>but interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country that offered the most </v>

93
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 1>support was actually cute</v>

94
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.100
<v Speaker 1>and we're following our treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalists duty,</v>

95
00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:15.970
<v Speaker 1>but don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

96
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.530
<v Speaker 1>He didn't stop at selling weapons to dos</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santos.</v>

97
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 1>He sends over 30,000 troops to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

98
00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:22.900
<v Speaker 1>Let's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the lengthy macy's,</v>

99
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:23.743
<v Speaker 1>the area that was under the MPLA control</v>
<v Speaker 1>received a lot of doctors and engineers </v>

100
00:05:27.141 --> 00:05:27.974
<v Speaker 1>from Ivana.</v>

101
00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.020
<v Speaker 2>This explain.</v>

102
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.770
<v Speaker 1>That's partly why dos Santos one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict.</v>

103
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:33.813
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the war still be ongoing during </v>

104
00:05:35.681 --> 00:05:36.514
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this man had taken control of most of </v>

105
00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:39.460
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

106
00:05:39.461 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>that Cuban help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

107
00:05:40.721 --> 00:05:43.590
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't as useful as you might think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

108
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.300
<v Speaker 1>the agriculture experts in from Cuba </v>
<v Speaker 1>tried to grow sugarcane on Angolan soil,</v>

109
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.253
<v Speaker 1>but there's apparently those seeds were </v>
<v Speaker 1>not good for the kind of soil that you </v>

110
00:05:51.551 --> 00:05:52.630
<v Speaker 1>find in Angola.</v>

111
00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>And this</v>

112
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 1>is why within just a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the farming lands in the </v>

113
00:06:00.861 --> 00:06:02.730
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became totally infertile.</v>

114
00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:07.370
<v Speaker 1>This meant stole vacation for Angolans </v>
<v Speaker 1>and an anger towards the Cuban help.</v>

115
00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:09.830
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as if this really wasn't enough after</v>

116
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:12.820
<v Speaker 1>the collapse of the Soviet Union at </v>
<v Speaker 1>Water Dot Santos,</v>

117
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.260
<v Speaker 1>realize that it's a good idea to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

118
00:06:15.261 --> 00:06:20.261
<v Speaker 1>the capitalist country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

119
00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:24.020
<v Speaker 1>these were the countries which would buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>their oil.</v>

120
00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:26.960
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is America was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>helping eunice hair anymore.</v>

121
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.823
<v Speaker 1>So what does this country need to do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become an ally of the so called free </v>

122
00:06:30.981 --> 00:06:32.030
<v Speaker 1>wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:06:32.031 --> 00:06:32.864
<v Speaker 1>BEC was only one thing to do when that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was removed the word Marxist from their </v>

124
00:06:35.751 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>vocabulary and swap it out for free </v>
<v Speaker 1>market democracy.</v>

125
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.813
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do say that with a touch of sarcasm </v>

126
00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>because Angolan capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:49.661
<v Speaker 1>that's certainly one of a kind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing the Angolan way yet.</v>

128
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:55.143
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was a turning point in [inaudible] </v>

129
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:57.553
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eduardo Cental signed the peace </v>

130
00:06:59.001 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 1>agreements with his adversaries since </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

131
00:07:01.221 --> 00:07:06.200
<v Speaker 1>unit has become a political party with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>right to run for elections for the first</v>

132
00:07:06.201 --> 00:07:08.750
<v Speaker 1>time in history and garlands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could enjoy democracy,</v>

133
00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 1>but not so many vast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the very same year.</v>

134
00:07:11.121 --> 00:07:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Another meaningful thing</v>

135
00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:20.340
<v Speaker 1>makes burst ultra deep water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil discovery off the coast of Angola.</v>

136
00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:24.310
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly I'm Buddha,</v>
<v Speaker 1>became an oil juggernaut selling tons of</v>

137
00:07:24.311 --> 00:07:27.910
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur juice to China in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States in just five years.</v>

138
00:07:27.911 --> 00:07:30.760
<v Speaker 1>I can go to the multiplied by four</v>

139
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 3>and go let's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Capital was being rebuilt.</v>

140
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.233
<v Speaker 3>The varied architecture from the fifties</v>
<v Speaker 3>and sixties is giving way to new office </v>

141
00:07:38.051 --> 00:07:38.884
<v Speaker 3>towers that are being built between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>national corporate sector and then and </v>

142
00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:43.443
<v Speaker 3>government</v>

143
00:07:43.620 --> 00:07:44.453
<v Speaker 1>companies like Exxon mobile in the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S or bp and the UK invested heavily in </v>

144
00:07:48.151 --> 00:07:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Angola and of course they sent engineers</v>
<v Speaker 1>and workers to live in the capital.</v>

145
00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:56.130
<v Speaker 1>All the little ones up and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people wanted good quality houses,</v>

146
00:07:56.131 --> 00:07:59.460
<v Speaker 1>cool bars and these same kinds of goods </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they could fly back home.</v>

147
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:02.370
<v Speaker 1>But all of those things that have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fines in the country that years,</v>

148
00:08:02.371 --> 00:08:04.890
<v Speaker 1>the fort was having a big old civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

149
00:08:04.891 --> 00:08:07.040
<v Speaker 1>the supply was small man's yet the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>

150
00:08:07.070 --> 00:08:09.000
<v Speaker 1>We didn't stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

151
00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:13.650
<v Speaker 1>the prices of Western goods went </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely sky high,</v>

152
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:14.803
<v Speaker 3>built for 500,000 people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The angerland capitalists now </v>

153
00:08:17.540 --> 00:08:18.373
<v Speaker 3>accommodating an estimated 5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even civil servants with comfortable </v>

154
00:08:23.391 --> 00:08:24.224
<v Speaker 3>salaries have</v>

155
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.880
<v Speaker 1>well making ends meet was wait just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>minute because there's more.</v>

156
00:08:27.970 --> 00:08:28.803
<v Speaker 1>Imagine we have a construction company </v>
<v Speaker 1>in China and we want to build a housing </v>

157
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:32.830
<v Speaker 1>block in new enza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:08:32.831 --> 00:08:35.130
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we want to do is </v>
<v Speaker 1>register a company,</v>

159
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:36.440
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

160
00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:39.190
<v Speaker 1>that process can take six months during </v>
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>

161
00:08:39.191 --> 00:08:40.024
<v Speaker 1>That's perfectly normal that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government fines and lots of problems </v>

162
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:44.620
<v Speaker 1>and they ask me for this paper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that registry,</v>

163
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.633
<v Speaker 1>and that's how the report that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably don't have the sort of report </v>

164
00:08:48.971 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Speaker 1>that a nice stack of cash and they do a </v>
<v Speaker 1>sweaty palm under a table,</v>

165
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:53.013
<v Speaker 1>could probably</v>

166
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.770
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

167
00:08:57.250 --> 00:08:58.083
<v Speaker 1>does have a reports made by </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations like Transparency </v>

168
00:09:01.150 --> 00:09:01.983
<v Speaker 1>International.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every company who does business </v>

169
00:09:03.821 --> 00:09:06.910
<v Speaker 1>in Angola has had to do with some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of bribery.</v>

170
00:09:06.970 --> 00:09:07.803
<v Speaker 1>The government's official,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait just a minute because this is </v>

171
00:09:10.271 --> 00:09:11.350
<v Speaker 1>still not the end of it.</v>

172
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:12.253
<v Speaker 3>Those oil companies like Exxon Mobil or </v>
<v Speaker 3>British Petroleum that we're willing to </v>

173
00:09:15.051 --> 00:09:15.884
<v Speaker 3>do business in Angola as they were,</v>
<v Speaker 3>had to establish partnerships with the </v>

174
00:09:19.071 --> 00:09:21.530
<v Speaker 3>government or so and goal the Angola </v>
<v Speaker 3>state</v>

175
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.683
<v Speaker 2>company</v>

176
00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:28.620
<v Speaker 1>now have a guest who is the head of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

177
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:29.131
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

178
00:09:29.131 --> 00:09:30.600
<v Speaker 1>that was all friend we mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>earlier,</v>

179
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Isabelle dos Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of the former presidents of</v>

180
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:34.224
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why Isabelle tell became </v>

181
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 1>the wealthiest women in Africa in so</v>

182
00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:44.043
<v Speaker 3>every major Angolan investment held by </v>
<v Speaker 3>dos Santos stemmed from taking a chunk </v>

183
00:09:47.591 --> 00:09:48.424
<v Speaker 3>of a company that wants to do business </v>
<v Speaker 3>in the country or from a stroke of the </v>

184
00:09:51.041 --> 00:09:53.350
<v Speaker 3>president's pen that cut her into the </v>
<v Speaker 3>action</v>

185
00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:55.430
<v Speaker 1>for all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the governments have dos Santos,</v>

186
00:09:55.431 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 1>the father of restricted access to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country for international journalists.</v>

187
00:09:59.121 --> 00:10:01.070
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the corruption scandals,</v>

188
00:10:01.071 --> 00:10:04.750
<v Speaker 1>we know what else I've been discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the governments of the US.</v>

189
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:06.103
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

190
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:11.270
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a political kind of like this,</v>

191
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.170
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can go then wanted to start a company,</v>

192
00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.033
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality was that you needed to be a </v>

193
00:10:15.451 --> 00:10:17.640
<v Speaker 1>millionaire in order to pay those </v>
<v Speaker 1>barriers.</v>

194
00:10:17.641 --> 00:10:20.700
<v Speaker 1>Brian's men's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if we would put the cost of bribery</v>

195
00:10:20.701 --> 00:10:21.534
<v Speaker 1>aside just with the basic bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need a thousand US dollars to start </v>

196
00:10:25.561 --> 00:10:26.394
<v Speaker 1>a normal bar in windsor in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as poor as I can get under a thousand </v>

197
00:10:29.910 --> 00:10:30.743
<v Speaker 1>dollars isn't absolutely not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these international companies were not </v>

198
00:10:36.031 --> 00:10:39.660
<v Speaker 1>willing to invest in the country more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the absolute minimum required</v>

199
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:40.613
<v Speaker 3>to extract the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So now you might wonder what were the </v>

200
00:10:42.751 --> 00:10:43.584
<v Speaker 3>consequences of all this well outcome is</v>
<v Speaker 3>that dinosaur juice is the only and </v>

201
00:10:47.491 --> 00:10:48.324
<v Speaker 3>Golan export back in the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the only new and Golan businesses were </v>

202
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:57.240
<v Speaker 3>crude oil extraction plants and houses </v>
<v Speaker 3>for its workers.</v>

203
00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:02.220
<v Speaker 3>By the year 2014 oil represented 97 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of end goal exports.</v>

204
00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.730
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

205
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:08.053
<v Speaker 1>This point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a regular visual politic via </v>

206
00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.480
<v Speaker 1>you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds pretty familiar to me.</v>

207
00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.900
<v Speaker 1>That's probably because you've seen on </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos on Venezuela,</v>

208
00:11:15.050 --> 00:11:17.390
<v Speaker 1>a country with a similar economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

209
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:18.740
<v Speaker 1>John's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens in Nicolas?</v>

210
00:11:18.741 --> 00:11:22.320
<v Speaker 1>Maduro has country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the oil market price went down,</v>

211
00:11:22.321 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 1>then Garla went right along with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's get onto the example of the</v>

212
00:11:26.481 --> 00:11:27.314
<v Speaker 1>Chinese construction companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many companies from China invested </v>

213
00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:30.523
<v Speaker 1>millions building entire neighborhoods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that professionals coming to the </v>

214
00:11:33.321 --> 00:11:34.154
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now there's no more oil industry </v>

215
00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.600
<v Speaker 1>then therefore there's no more workers.</v>

216
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:39.733
<v Speaker 3>Four lane highways without cause schools</v>
<v Speaker 3>with no pupils and under five years a </v>

217
00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:48.930
<v Speaker 3>Chinese company built Columbia using oil</v>
<v Speaker 3>credit lines with China,</v>

218
00:11:49.590 --> 00:11:53.290
<v Speaker 3>but parts of Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel like a ghost town in summary,</v>

219
00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.400
<v Speaker 3>that is only</v>

220
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.233
<v Speaker 1>one winner in that story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that person is who sandwell dude or </v>

221
00:11:57.460 --> 00:11:58.293
<v Speaker 1>Santos and his daughter Isabelle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has already invested these enormous </v>

222
00:12:01.931 --> 00:12:02.764
<v Speaker 1>profits overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the big Portuguese firms from </v>

223
00:12:05.381 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>galp to Unitel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now under the control of this family.</v>

224
00:12:09.310 --> 00:12:11.920
<v Speaker 1>If Portugal was a colonizer in the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

225
00:12:11.921 --> 00:12:12.754
<v Speaker 1>they've now become Angola's money </v>
<v Speaker 1>launderer out and golden elites have </v>

226
00:12:15.790 --> 00:12:20.200
<v Speaker 1>sent an estimated $119,000,000,000 out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country.</v>

227
00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:22.780
<v Speaker 1>And while the entire country is having a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

228
00:12:22.810 --> 00:12:23.643
<v Speaker 1>Isabelle dos Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who identifies herself as entrepreneur </v>

229
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:27.303
<v Speaker 1>on our twitter account,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes out with celebrities like Kim </v>

230
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:32.200
<v Speaker 1>called Dashi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of this being said,</v>

231
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:35.800
<v Speaker 1>you might have guessed the dos Santos </v>
<v Speaker 1>family is not that popular here.</v>

232
00:12:35.801 --> 00:12:36.634
<v Speaker 1>Now you go there,</v>

233
00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:37.703
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

234
00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:42.760
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

235
00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:43.594
<v Speaker 1>that political party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the MPLA keeps stealing the show </v>

236
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:46.773
<v Speaker 1>election after election getting over 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the votes this past August </v>

237
00:12:50.951 --> 00:12:54.640
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angola held an electric despite the fact</v>

238
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.760
<v Speaker 1>that juice Eduardo Dot Santos was not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>does anymore.</v>

239
00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.330
<v Speaker 1>His party at one end game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm so now you might be wondering,</v>

240
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:02.500

<v Speaker 1>why does this happen?</v>

<v Speaker 1>going to need rejects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>EU election observers.</v>

243
00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.910

<v Speaker 1>is it going to be possible for Angola to</v>

244
00:13:13.911 --> 00:13:14.744
<v Speaker 1>get rid of this corrupt ruling class?</v>
