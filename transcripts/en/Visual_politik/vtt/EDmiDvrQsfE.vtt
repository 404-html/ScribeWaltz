1
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.353
<v Speaker 1>I've got a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would happen if Ronald Reagan came </v>

2
00:00:10.521 --> 00:00:13.790
<v Speaker 1>back to life and met Donald Trump in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oval office?</v>

3
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.653
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they'd become friends?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that shake hands and find </v>

4
00:00:17.001 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>common grounds with similar values and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political beliefs?</v>

5
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.073
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both are considered diehard </v>

6
00:00:22.221 --> 00:00:23.054
<v Speaker 1>conservatives both aren't considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>boogie man for liberals and both had a </v>

7
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:29.420
<v Speaker 1>career in show business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact,</v>

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.313
<v Speaker 1>this is where the similarities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan's job as president was to </v>

9
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:43.140
<v Speaker 1>find the worst recession since the great</v>
<v Speaker 1>depression and to do so.</v>

10
00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.490
<v Speaker 1>He promised the Reagan Revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called revolution,</v>

11
00:00:47.491 --> 00:00:51.570
<v Speaker 1>focusing on reducing government spending</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes as well as regulation</v>

12
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.810
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not government.</v>

13
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:58.273
<v Speaker 1>President Reagan likes the free markets </v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe that capitalism would solve </v>

14
00:01:01.581 --> 00:01:02.414
<v Speaker 1>the nation's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also like to portray himself as a </v>

15
00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.890
<v Speaker 1>humble paternal figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

16
00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>he prided himself on being a man of high</v>
<v Speaker 1>moral values</v>

17
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.190
<v Speaker 2>would be unmistakable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Open this gate,</v>

18
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.860
<v Speaker 1>trump however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a totally different animal.</v>

19
00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.980
<v Speaker 1>He shows off his fortune,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his former model trophy wife,</v>

20
00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.350
<v Speaker 1>and he is so obviously the opposite of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>paternal figure.</v>

21
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.853
<v Speaker 1>He's more like that weird uncle living </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a bachelor regardless of his age </v>

22
00:01:38.381 --> 00:01:39.214
<v Speaker 1>and guessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>embarrassingly drunk during family </v>

23
00:01:40.571 --> 00:01:41.440
<v Speaker 1>reunions.</v>

24
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.250
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

25
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.550
<v Speaker 1>On the policy side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is seldom friendly toward the free</v>

26
00:01:49.551 --> 00:01:52.200
<v Speaker 1>market and smaller government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He loves debt.</v>

27
00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.640
<v Speaker 1>The idea of trade wars and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionist policy have taken care of.</v>

28
00:01:55.641 --> 00:01:59.850
<v Speaker 1>America seems to be at odds with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>gips tendency to be in favor,</v>

29
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.930
<v Speaker 1>at least in theory of the free market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can probably see,</v>

30
00:02:09.441 --> 00:02:13.550
<v Speaker 1>there is a clash that runs deep in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>soul of the Republican Party,</v>

31
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.850
<v Speaker 1>or at least this is how it looks from an</v>
<v Speaker 1>outside perspective.</v>

32
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.050
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's this,</v>

33
00:02:18.051 --> 00:02:19.880
<v Speaker 1>the good old party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but loves America.</v>

34
00:02:19.881 --> 00:02:23.060
<v Speaker 1>Small government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low taxes and conservative values,</v>

35
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.320
<v Speaker 1>and then there is this other Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>party that loves trophy wives,</v>

36
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>big beautiful walls and terrorists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who's winning?</v>

37
00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you guessed it.</v>

38
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.003
<v Speaker 1>There was a wave of Republicans leaving </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress among all of these differences </v>

39
00:02:44.261 --> 00:02:45.094
<v Speaker 1>in values and policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new cycle has been completely taken </v>

40
00:02:47.681 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>over by a new wave of Republicans and </v>
<v Speaker 1>she was the most important of them all.</v>

41
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would actually be pulled up Ryan,</v>

42
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 1>the speaker of the House and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans,</v>

43
00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:57.994
<v Speaker 1>golden boy for years for Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the champion of fiscal rectitude and </v>

44
00:03:01.121 --> 00:03:01.954
<v Speaker 1>smaller government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now he's announced that he's not </v>

45
00:03:06.501 --> 00:03:09.140
<v Speaker 1>going to run for reelection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>

46
00:03:09.141 --> 00:03:11.720
<v Speaker 1>he's not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many republicans might be living,</v>

47
00:03:11.721 --> 00:03:15.440
<v Speaker 1>but there are always new elections and </v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore new candidates,</v>

48
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.290
<v Speaker 1>but also ones with questionable </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

49
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:19.243
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Alabama special elections held back </v>

50
00:03:21.411 --> 00:03:23.330
<v Speaker 1>in December of 2017,</v>

51
00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.513
<v Speaker 4>back candidate Roy Moore was buried </v>
<v Speaker 4>under tons of allegations of sexual </v>

52
00:03:28.241 --> 00:03:33.241
<v Speaker 4>abuse of minors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>For these scandals,</v>

53
00:03:35.501 --> 00:03:39.130
<v Speaker 4>Republicans lost the seat in Alabama for</v>
<v Speaker 4>the first time in decades,</v>

54
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.083
<v Speaker 4>but the biggest surprise is that a </v>
<v Speaker 4>republican president supported and </v>

55
00:03:43.001 --> 00:03:43.834
<v Speaker 4>alleged sexual predator.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Could you imagine something like this </v>

56
00:03:46.181 --> 00:03:50.650
<v Speaker 4>just five years ago as you could expect,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this Alabama scandal appeared on all the</v>

57
00:03:50.651 --> 00:03:52.870
<v Speaker 4>national newspapers and hit the White </v>
<v Speaker 4>House,</v>

58
00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.210
<v Speaker 1>and now you might wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

59
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.020
<v Speaker 1>what did Donald trump do to solve this </v>
<v Speaker 1>pr crisis?</v>

60
00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did absolutely nothing.</v>

61
00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:07.163
<v Speaker 1>Nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is one of the reasons why so </v>

62
00:04:09.331 --> 00:04:12.570
<v Speaker 1>many Republican candidates are doing so </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly in the polls,</v>

63
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.463
<v Speaker 1>even in traditionally red states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what does this mean for the White </v>

64
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.190
<v Speaker 1>House?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

65
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 1>for those who don't keep up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>American politics so much this year,</v>

66
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.620
<v Speaker 1>the country had legislative elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these other so called midterms.</v>

67
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.150
<v Speaker 1>This is when members of Congress and </v>
<v Speaker 1>many senators and relax it in America,</v>

68
00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.030
<v Speaker 1>the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is the executive power is voted</v>

69
00:04:36.031 --> 00:04:39.840
<v Speaker 1>in during one election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the legislative power during another.</v>

70
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.160
<v Speaker 1>This is why,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

71
00:04:41.161 --> 00:04:45.240
<v Speaker 1>despite Obama being Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the legislative chambers</v>

72
00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:46.103
<v Speaker 1>were Republican,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the Republicans lose too many </v>

73
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:48.474
<v Speaker 1>seats during the 2018 midterms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is going to be in dire straits </v>

74
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:55.860
<v Speaker 1>anytime he wants to pass a bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That the real question now is,</v>

75
00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:56.783
<v Speaker 1>how did the Republican Party gassier can</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political party change their ideology </v>

76
00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:02.490
<v Speaker 1>this quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:05:02.491 --> 00:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

78
00:05:03.931 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history.</v>

79
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.653
<v Speaker 1>Reagan revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan started out as a </v>

80
00:05:16.181 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 1>registered Democrats and a new deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>support,</v>

81
00:05:18.921 --> 00:05:19.754
<v Speaker 1>but he left the party in 1962 crossing </v>
<v Speaker 1>over to the gop stating that he didn't </v>

82
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:27.610
<v Speaker 1>leave the Democratic Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was the party that left him.</v>

83
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.580
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things in the gop were not ideal either.</v>

84
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:31.563
<v Speaker 1>According to Reagan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Republicans had bought into most of the </v>

85
00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.611
<v Speaker 1>values of the Democratic Party and </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the passionate rhetoric,</v>

86
00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:42.023
<v Speaker 1>than once some truth to that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of cultural </v>

87
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:45.173
<v Speaker 1>hegemony?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a concept Marxist philosophers </v>

88
00:05:47.101 --> 00:05:48.810
<v Speaker 1>like to use a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to them,</v>

89
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:52.200
<v Speaker 1>the ruling class needs to create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>consensus,</v>

90
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:56.610
<v Speaker 1>a set of moral values that are shared by</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the political players,</v>

91
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>including the opposition party.</v>

92
00:06:02.390 --> 00:06:03.223
<v Speaker 1>Back then idea is like the welfare state</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the need for more governmental </v>

93
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>control of the economy that came the new</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainstream,</v>

94
00:06:09.290 --> 00:06:10.123
<v Speaker 1>even the republican side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept those principles if they </v>

95
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.464
<v Speaker 1>wanted to be considered a serious power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why both Nixon and </v>

96
00:06:15.891 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>Eisenhower did very little when it comes</v>
<v Speaker 1>to economics and you guys did.</v>

97
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Reagan was not a big fan of this.</v>

98
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.033
<v Speaker 5>No nation in history has ever survived a</v>
<v Speaker 5>tax burden that reached a third of its </v>

99
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.173
<v Speaker 5>national income today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Thirty seven cents out of every dollar </v>

100
00:06:31.091 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 5>earned in this country is the tax </v>
<v Speaker 5>collectors share.</v>

101
00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:34.863
<v Speaker 1>Here comes the interesting pos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cultural hegemony is something that </v>

102
00:06:37.901 --> 00:06:41.410
<v Speaker 1>changes over time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well when those values are no longer</v>

103
00:06:41.411 --> 00:06:45.670
<v Speaker 1>solving people's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens in the 19 seventies</v>

104
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:46.533
<v Speaker 1>with the energy crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America was really not in a good place </v>

105
00:06:49.691 --> 00:06:52.990
<v Speaker 1>back then and this was the window of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity that Ronald Reagan needed to</v>

106
00:06:52.991 --> 00:06:53.824
<v Speaker 1>reinvents the Republican Party and </v>
<v Speaker 1>create the ideological platform we used </v>

107
00:06:57.431 --> 00:06:59.560
<v Speaker 1>to know as conservatism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

108
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.453
<v Speaker 1>he took something old and made it shiny </v>
<v Speaker 1>again by more or less creating a brands </v>

109
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 1>new ideology.</v>

110
00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:10.600
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

111
00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:11.583
<v Speaker 1>how do you do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can you create a brand new ideology </v>

112
00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:16.780
<v Speaker 1>that makes sense and lets you win </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections?</v>

113
00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:17.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me introduce you to the theory of </v>

114
00:07:19.271 --> 00:07:21.250
<v Speaker 1>the empty signifier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

115
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:22.084
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan went to all the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups that fell outside of the </v>

116
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:28.080
<v Speaker 1>political mainstream at the time he </v>
<v Speaker 1>spoke to the evangelical conservative.</v>

117
00:07:28.081 --> 00:07:28.914
<v Speaker 1>So one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you spoke to the military industrial </v>

118
00:07:30.251 --> 00:07:31.084
<v Speaker 1>complex guys for another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally he spoke to everybody who </v>

119
00:07:33.671 --> 00:07:34.504
<v Speaker 1>was tired of paying so many taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he merged all of these groups into </v>

120
00:07:38.831 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>one common cause,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberty and freedom.</v>

121
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.353
<v Speaker 1>This is what we call an empty signifier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a concept so vague that everybody </v>

122
00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:51.760
<v Speaker 1>can project onto the vagueness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meaning that they're looking for.</v>

123
00:07:51.790 --> 00:07:52.623
<v Speaker 1>For a fiscal conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom means being free from paying so </v>

124
00:07:55.091 --> 00:07:55.924
<v Speaker 1>many taxes for a whole kitchen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservative freedom means fighting or </v>

125
00:07:58.851 --> 00:08:00.250
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian rulers.</v>

126
00:08:00.540 --> 00:08:01.373
<v Speaker 5>In this present crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 5>government is not the solution to our </v>

127
00:08:05.191 --> 00:08:08.310
<v Speaker 5>problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Government is the problem,</v>

128
00:08:08.430 --> 00:08:09.263
<v Speaker 1>but think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How is it possible to have people so </v>

129
00:08:11.431 --> 00:08:13.800
<v Speaker 1>different from one another on the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>platform?</v>

130
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:14.693
<v Speaker 1>It's a big time contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have someone who wants small </v>

131
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 1>government and someone else who wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>increase military spending.</v>

132
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:20.790
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:08:20.791 --> 00:08:22.590
<v Speaker 1>if you want to create a political </v>
<v Speaker 1>identity,</v>

134
00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.470
<v Speaker 1>you need an antagonist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Ronald Reagan,</v>

135
00:08:25.770 --> 00:08:29.010
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't have had it easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Open this gate,</v>

136
00:08:33.540 --> 00:08:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Mr Gorbachev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tear down this.</v>

137
00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:42.290
<v Speaker 2>Whoa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

138
00:08:42.291 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

139
00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:43.213
<v Speaker 1>He picked the evil communists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why during the 1980 [inaudible] </v>

140
00:08:45.811 --> 00:08:48.560
<v Speaker 1>there were so many movies where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists were the bad guys.</v>

141
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.360
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have talked to us like Red Dawn,</v>

142
00:08:50.361 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>rocky four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>

143
00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:53.510
<v Speaker 1>top gun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these movies,</v>

144
00:08:53.511 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>along with Reagan's speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>helps create a brand new cultural,</v>

145
00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:57.993
<v Speaker 1>hegemonic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even democratic presidents like crimson </v>

146
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:02.820
<v Speaker 1>to promise tax cuts in order to win an </v>
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>

147
00:09:02.890 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

148
00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union fell in the nineties.</v>

149
00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:13.270
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when you lose your </v>
<v Speaker 1>antagonist?</v>

150
00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:14.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you simply find another one like </v>

151
00:09:15.821 --> 00:09:20.620
<v Speaker 1>President Reagan did two decades before </v>
<v Speaker 1>President Bush operated from a Christian</v>

152
00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:23.440
<v Speaker 1>worldview that distinguishes between </v>
<v Speaker 1>good and evil.</v>

153
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:24.363
<v Speaker 1>After the tragedy of September,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 11th presidents Bush announced that </v>

154
00:09:27.581 --> 00:09:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the battle ahead would be a monumental </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggle of good versus evil.</v>

155
00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:33.193
<v Speaker 1>The good will prevail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's how these so called evil </v>

156
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:37.870
<v Speaker 1>became America's new enemy.</v>

157
00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:41.410
<v Speaker 6>We will rally the world to this caused </v>
<v Speaker 6>by our efforts,</v>

158
00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.250
<v Speaker 6>by our courage.</v>
<v Speaker 6>We will not tire,</v>

159
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:49.060
<v Speaker 6>we will not falter,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and we will not fail,</v>

160
00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:50.930
<v Speaker 3>of course.</v>

161
00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:53.810
<v Speaker 1>So I'm not saying that terrorists are </v>
<v Speaker 1>communists and all evil or that they are</v>

162
00:09:53.811 --> 00:09:56.300
<v Speaker 1>just some sort of fabricated monster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not,</v>

163
00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:59.660
<v Speaker 1>but they can be utilized to create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political platform.</v>

164
00:09:59.990 --> 00:10:02.150
<v Speaker 1>Every important politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've done it.</v>

165
00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt did it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan did it,</v>

166
00:10:03.970 --> 00:10:04.803
<v Speaker 1>Bush did it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens when you run out of </v>

167
00:10:06.591 --> 00:10:08.930
<v Speaker 1>enemies?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens when the Soviet Union is no</v>

168
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:10.850
<v Speaker 1>more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or when bin Laden is debt?</v>

169
00:10:11.060 --> 00:10:13.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the time for,</v>

170
00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.433
<v Speaker 3>oh,</v>

171
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but trump revolution after the 2008 </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis,</v>

172
00:10:24.231 --> 00:10:25.064
<v Speaker 1>the economic mainstream,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cultural hegemony was once again a </v>

173
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:28.843
<v Speaker 1>challenge resulting in people not </v>
<v Speaker 1>trusting the economic mainstream </v>

174
00:10:31.761 --> 00:10:32.550
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>

175
00:10:32.550 --> 00:10:33.383
<v Speaker 6>The word didn't spread through </v>
<v Speaker 6>mainstream media and immediately the </v>

176
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:36.324
<v Speaker 6>question arose whether or not the lack </v>
<v Speaker 6>of coverage was because it wasn't </v>

177
00:10:38.401 --> 00:10:42.450
<v Speaker 6>newsworthy or because some of the people</v>
<v Speaker 6>being protested against have the control</v>

178
00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:46.620
<v Speaker 6>over the various mainstream media </v>
<v Speaker 6>outlets on September 30th.</v>

179
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.520
<v Speaker 6>We took a trip into the city to see what</v>

180
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.393
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't being talked about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When people lose faith in something </v>

181
00:10:51.350 --> 00:10:52.183
<v Speaker 1>that's usually leaves a void that needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be filled by a new kind of discourse </v>

182
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:57.403
<v Speaker 1>and here sweeps in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did Donald J dot trump with his </v>

183
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:04.370
<v Speaker 1>inflammatory speeches during campaign </v>
<v Speaker 1>rallies all his personal scandals and is</v>

184
00:11:04.371 --> 00:11:08.000
<v Speaker 1>scorching and polarizing public </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements once again,</v>

185
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.040
<v Speaker 1>a new presidential candidate managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>align himself with an astounding variety</v>

186
00:11:13.041 --> 00:11:17.390
<v Speaker 1>of political and religious groups that </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt misrepresented by the mainstream.</v>

187
00:11:21.880 --> 00:11:22.713
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of evangelical Christians </v>

188
00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:26.073
<v Speaker 1>voted for trump much more than any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>religious Greek evangelical Christian </v>

189
00:11:29.891 --> 00:11:32.530
<v Speaker 1>values are about family and moral </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrity.</v>

190
00:11:32.590 --> 00:11:33.423
<v Speaker 1>So why is a guy like trump with all his </v>
<v Speaker 1>divorces and sexual scandals not </v>

191
00:11:36.851 --> 00:11:38.830
<v Speaker 1>perceived as immoral by them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:11:38.831 --> 00:11:39.664
<v Speaker 1>even in the light of the recent media </v>
<v Speaker 1>storm surrounding the alleged cash </v>

193
00:11:42.130 --> 00:11:43.720
<v Speaker 1>payment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you silence Pornstar?</v>

194
00:11:43.721 --> 00:11:44.554
<v Speaker 1>Stormy Daniels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy eight percent of evangelical </v>

195
00:11:47.321 --> 00:11:48.154
<v Speaker 1>voters still support trump as army </v>
<v Speaker 1>evangelical leaders went as far as </v>

196
00:11:52.061 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>publicly stating they have given the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president's what they called a Mulligan.</v>

197
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:57.510
<v Speaker 1>A do over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I bought a gun,</v>

198
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.560
<v Speaker 1>is a golf metaphor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is strangely appropriate.</v>

199
00:12:00.561 --> 00:12:03.190
<v Speaker 1>It's considering trumps passion for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>sport.</v>

200
00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:07.753
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>evangelical conservatives gave him a </v>

201
00:12:09.081 --> 00:12:11.090
<v Speaker 4>Mulligan.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They let them have a do over.</v>

202
00:12:11.330 --> 00:12:12.163
<v Speaker 4>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we will start fresh with you and give </v>

203
00:12:13.431 --> 00:12:15.690
<v Speaker 4>you a second chance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Tony Perkins,</v>

204
00:12:15.740 --> 00:12:16.850
<v Speaker 4>speaking at CNN,</v>

205
00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.020
<v Speaker 1>so how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

206
00:12:19.021 --> 00:12:21.840
<v Speaker 1>as you might've guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the antagonists come into play,</v>

207
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:25.980
<v Speaker 1>so who or what is trump's political </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy?</v>

208
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.220
<v Speaker 1>The first group that immediately comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to mind is the mainstream media,</v>

209
00:12:29.370 --> 00:12:32.850
<v Speaker 1>or as the American president calls them </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fake news media.</v>

210
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:33.713
<v Speaker 1>The second enemy is the so called swamp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A term that refers to the not so clean </v>

211
00:12:37.261 --> 00:12:40.470
<v Speaker 1>and not so transparent political scene </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Washington.</v>

212
00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:43.740
<v Speaker 1>The third have many more enemies is you </v>
<v Speaker 1>guessed it,</v>

213
00:12:43.860 --> 00:12:44.693
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so trump can always play the me or the </v>

214
00:12:46.711 --> 00:12:49.320
<v Speaker 1>others card and it seems to work for </v>
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>

215
00:12:53.010 --> 00:12:55.350
<v Speaker 1>So what do all these talking points have</v>
<v Speaker 1>in common?</v>

216
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the outright has been using them </v>

217
00:12:57.690 --> 00:12:58.523
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump managed to appeal to evangelicals </v>

218
00:13:00.931 --> 00:13:01.764
<v Speaker 1>and members of the foreign rights that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time it felt misinterpreted </v>

219
00:13:04.381 --> 00:13:05.214
<v Speaker 1>by the liberal and mainstream media and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's rhetoric on migration also </v>

220
00:13:08.641 --> 00:13:10.950
<v Speaker 1>driven the support of the extreme far </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

221
00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes the Neo Nazi rally in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Charlottesville.</v>

222
00:13:13.201 --> 00:13:15.450
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't later condemned by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

223
00:13:15.570 --> 00:13:18.180
<v Speaker 1>He went so far as to say that the were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very fine.</v>

224
00:13:18.181 --> 00:13:20.100
<v Speaker 1>People on both sides</v>

225
00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.410
<v Speaker 7>from Mexico.</v>

226
00:13:23.410 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 4>Can us too bad on the trump campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 4>two moments.</v>

227
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.570
<v Speaker 1>Trump's rhetoric has also spawned a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Republican candidates.</v>

228
00:13:30.571 --> 00:13:31.404
<v Speaker 1>This are trying to appeal to the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>voters that are at the core base of the </v>

229
00:13:34.831 --> 00:13:38.940
<v Speaker 1>presidents going so far as to state that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are trumpea than trump,</v>

230
00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:39.883
<v Speaker 1>but does it actually work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently it works pretty well for </v>

231
00:13:42.151 --> 00:13:43.890
<v Speaker 1>those bearing the trump name.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take,</v>

232
00:13:43.891 --> 00:13:46.680
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the West Virginia Republican primary,</v>

233
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.130
<v Speaker 1>one of the candidates came up with an ad</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was filled to the brim with trump's</v>

234
00:13:50.131 --> 00:13:51.690
<v Speaker 1>preferred phrases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idioms,</v>

235
00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.930
<v Speaker 1>and yet still he came up last in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>race</v>

236
00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:56.033
<v Speaker 8>swap.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Captain Mitch Mcconnell has created </v>

237
00:13:57.281 --> 00:14:00.100
<v Speaker 8>millions of jobs for China people while </v>
<v Speaker 8>doing so.</v>

238
00:14:00.130 --> 00:14:02.140
<v Speaker 8>Mitch has gotten rid of.</v>
<v Speaker 8>In fact,</v>

239
00:14:02.141 --> 00:14:04.810
<v Speaker 8>there's China.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Family has given him tens of millions of</v>

240
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:07.300
<v Speaker 8>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 8>Micha swamp people are now running false</v>

241
00:14:07.301 --> 00:14:08.530
<v Speaker 8>negative ads against me</v>

242
00:14:08.770 --> 00:14:09.603
<v Speaker 1>in order to give you a fuller accounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the trump presidency would kind of </v>

243
00:14:11.861 --> 00:14:13.990
<v Speaker 1>need a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>

244
00:14:13.991 --> 00:14:17.260
<v Speaker 1>considering all this controversy well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how other Republicans doing,</v>

245
00:14:17.290 --> 00:14:21.460
<v Speaker 1>many political analysts believe that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic blue wave and they crash onto</v>

246
00:14:21.461 --> 00:14:22.294
<v Speaker 1>these midterm elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is it only a reaction to trump </v>

247
00:14:25.391 --> 00:14:29.950
<v Speaker 1>scandals or the democratic inclined </v>
<v Speaker 1>voters more energized?</v>

248
00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.570
<v Speaker 4>Republicans are losing 2018 midterm </v>
<v Speaker 4>money wars</v>

249
00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:43.523
<v Speaker 1>as reported by CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The GOP is worried about these incoming </v>

250
00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:47.790
<v Speaker 1>midterm elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that piece,</v>

251
00:14:47.791 --> 00:14:51.710
<v Speaker 1>CNN reported that senior members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party are wanting the younger members to</v>

252
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.663
<v Speaker 1>accumulate as many donations as possible</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to be able to successfully run </v>

253
00:14:56.361 --> 00:14:58.690
<v Speaker 1>campaigns in a difficult political </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

254
00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Suffice it to say that in the is most </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive house races,</v>

255
00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:03.253
<v Speaker 1>40 Republicans have been outraged by </v>
<v Speaker 1>that democratic challenges with our </v>

256
00:15:06.591 --> 00:15:07.424
<v Speaker 1>speaker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Ryan's abrupt access to the </v>

257
00:15:08.541 --> 00:15:10.940
<v Speaker 1>Republican corporate donor base was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bit shaken,</v>

258
00:15:11.030 --> 00:15:13.960
<v Speaker 1>a number of party donors and operatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>believed that the speaker's acts.</v>

259
00:15:13.961 --> 00:15:17.390
<v Speaker 1>It was the final piece of evidence that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed to flip their attention from</v>

260
00:15:17.391 --> 00:15:18.224
<v Speaker 1>the house to the Senate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means empty house wallets for </v>

261
00:15:20.451 --> 00:15:21.284
<v Speaker 1>House Republicans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will pretty much be left to fend </v>

262
00:15:23.121 --> 00:15:23.954
<v Speaker 1>for themselves.</v>

263
00:15:29.790 --> 00:15:30.000
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

264
00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.100
<v Speaker 1>we need to remember that when it comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>to politics,</v>

265
00:15:32.130 --> 00:15:35.190
<v Speaker 1>nothing is written in stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have visual politic.</v>

266
00:15:35.250 --> 00:15:38.370
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be keeping a close eye on</v>
<v Speaker 1>these upcoming midterms,</v>

267
00:15:38.490 --> 00:15:40.010
<v Speaker 1>but as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you do need to run another.</v>

268
00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:42.420
<v Speaker 1>When it comes to politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's written in stone.</v>

269
00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:43.333
<v Speaker 1>We have visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting to pay special attention </v>

270
00:15:45.150 --> 00:15:47.820
<v Speaker 1>to these upcoming midterms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now it's your turn.</v>

271
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.980
<v Speaker 1>All the Republicans losing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility.</v>

272
00:15:49.981 --> 00:15:51.780
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that they're going to lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>votes?</v>

273
00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:55.080
<v Speaker 1>Is a democratic blue wave coming to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>midterms?</v>
