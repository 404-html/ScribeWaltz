1
00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.020
<v Speaker 1>Is to currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What tinder is,</v>

2
00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.400
<v Speaker 1>taps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody loves to criticize it,</v>

3
00:00:13.401 --> 00:00:14.234
<v Speaker 1>but at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of people wouldn't expect to use </v>

4
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:18.110
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Totally do.</v>

5
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.003
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure many of you have heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists and experts have all kinds </v>

6
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:25.040
<v Speaker 1>making predictions about the ends of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>single European currency</v>

7
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.200
<v Speaker 1>thing Germany could do for Europe is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>quit the single currency,</v>

8
00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 1>but it won't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Larry Elliott for the Guardian Euro,</v>

9
00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.363
<v Speaker 1>is it patently flawed construct,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which it's architects knew at the time </v>

10
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>of its creation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Soros.</v>

11
00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.390
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is way different.</v>

12
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:48.313
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the euro is the second most common </v>

13
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.790
<v Speaker 1>worldwide reserve currency and at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of the video today,</v>

14
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:53.624
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see how it might not be </v>
<v Speaker 1>far from being the first and at this </v>

15
00:00:57.111 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 1>point you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the u s dollars fast.</v>

16
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.730
<v Speaker 1>There's absolutely no way that's going </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere,</v>

17
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>but maybe I'm right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

18
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.960
<v Speaker 1>one third of international trade uses </v>
<v Speaker 1>the euro as its exchange currency.</v>

19
00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.823
<v Speaker 1>Twenty percent of the reserve currencies</v>
<v Speaker 1>from central banks are denominated in </v>

20
00:01:13.281 --> 00:01:17.480
<v Speaker 1>euros and many other countries also </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue debt in this currency,</v>

21
00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.730
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you follow visual politic every week,</v>

22
00:01:25.731 --> 00:01:26.564
<v Speaker 1>you already know that Donald trump is </v>
<v Speaker 1>putting lots of terrorists on </v>

23
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:31.970
<v Speaker 1>international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>

24
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>If Americans are going to buy less stuff</v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>

26
00:01:35.691 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 1>there will be fewer dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation.</v>

27
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.313
<v Speaker 1>And then you've got to think about who's</v>
<v Speaker 1>signing free trade deals with seemingly </v>

28
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.510
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course that's the European Union.</v>

29
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.550
<v Speaker 1>They've already passed a treaty with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

30
00:01:46.551 --> 00:01:50.450
<v Speaker 1>the so-called seater,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the only one.</v>

31
00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.373
<v Speaker 1>In the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe has reduced terrorists with </v>

32
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

33
00:01:54.021 --> 00:01:55.130
<v Speaker 1>and many other countries.</v>

34
00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.190
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the more Europeans by abroad,</v>

35
00:02:02.191 --> 00:02:04.410
<v Speaker 1>the more euros there will be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>circulation.</v>

36
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.333
<v Speaker 1>This means that could be a moment where </v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of having one hegemonic reserve </v>

37
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:09.563
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might have two US dollar and the </v>

38
00:02:12.631 --> 00:02:13.464
<v Speaker 1>euro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can probably guess what you're </v>

39
00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:15.300
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

40
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.163
<v Speaker 1>what good does this really do anyone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it actually useful for the Europeans </v>

41
00:02:19.921 --> 00:02:22.800
<v Speaker 1>to have the euro as their currency?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and at the same time,</v>

43
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.183
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're watching this from a country </v>

44
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:29.543
<v Speaker 1>and you have a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well having the euro as the world's </v>

45
00:02:31.831 --> 00:02:33.780
<v Speaker 1>reserve currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to help you,</v>

46
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.580
<v Speaker 2>but if</v>

47
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.070
<v Speaker 1>you're working for a European </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

48
00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 1>boy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're probably feeling really lucky.</v>

49
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.413
<v Speaker 1>If there's a big demand for euros,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Central Bank will have a </v>

50
00:02:48.971 --> 00:02:52.150
<v Speaker 1>bigger margins of prince money without </v>
<v Speaker 1>devaluing it.</v>

51
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.103
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually talked about this in our </v>

52
00:02:54.281 --> 00:02:57.310
<v Speaker 1>video about the dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't seen that one yet,</v>

53
00:02:57.311 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>you'll find a link in the description </v>
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>

54
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.483
<v Speaker 1>Check it out after watching this one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the big question is why is the euro </v>

55
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:07.300
<v Speaker 1>more popular than any other currency?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

56
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:08.134
<v Speaker 1>why the euro and why not the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>yuan and why are so many economists </v>

57
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.420
<v Speaker 1>critical of the Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

59
00:03:15.131 --> 00:03:17.410
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we always do,</v>

60
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.500
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>central crisis.</v>

61
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.353
<v Speaker 1>During the seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European countries were happy to trade </v>

62
00:03:27.371 --> 00:03:28.204
<v Speaker 1>with each other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although there was no European Union </v>

63
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:30.454
<v Speaker 1>back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was something very similar and </v>

64
00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:34.210
<v Speaker 1>that was the common market.</v>

65
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.650
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a problem.</v>

66
00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:36.573
<v Speaker 1>Each country had its own national </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency at each currency works in a </v>

67
00:03:40.301 --> 00:03:41.380
<v Speaker 1>different way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

68
00:03:41.381 --> 00:03:46.210
<v Speaker 1>the German market was strong and stable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Italian lira was devaluing every</v>

69
00:03:46.211 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>other day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mentioned the situation,</v>

70
00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.690
<v Speaker 1>you work in a German bank and do you </v>
<v Speaker 1>lend a million layers?</v>

71
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.533
<v Speaker 1>Do An Italian company at the moment that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you lend at a million layers is worth a </v>

72
00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:57.663
<v Speaker 1>thousand German marks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it's time for that Italian </v>

73
00:03:59.081 --> 00:04:01.930
<v Speaker 1>company to give you the money back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lira has been devalued.</v>

74
00:04:01.931 --> 00:04:02.764
<v Speaker 1>So even if you get a million lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>back when you exchanged Clo who </v>

75
00:04:05.711 --> 00:04:09.280
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you only get about 900 German marks,</v>

76
00:04:09.281 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>not exactly business brilliance.</v>

77
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.593
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in order to avoid this European </v>

78
00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:22.470
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they met together in a room,</v>

79
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.730
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really not making this up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently they decided to try something</v>

80
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.653
<v Speaker 1>called verse snake in the tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's the snake is kind of a </v>

81
00:04:30.631 --> 00:04:34.590
<v Speaker 1>metaphor for currency fluctuations </v>
<v Speaker 1>because currencies go up and down,</v>

82
00:04:34.591 --> 00:04:36.720
<v Speaker 1>like apparently a snake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it goes up and down.</v>

83
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.580
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't want the snake to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

84
00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>you make a tunnel and put the snake in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the tunnel.</v>

85
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:42.084
<v Speaker 1>That way the currency doesn't fluctuate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look for any possible excuse for this </v>

86
00:04:45.181 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>sort of analogy was that it was the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies.</v>

87
00:04:47.551 --> 00:04:49.860
<v Speaker 1>Bob Marley was alive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bell bottoms with trendy.</v>

88
00:04:49.861 --> 00:04:52.140
<v Speaker 1>It was just a really different time.</v>

89
00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:59.750
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so importantly,</v>

90
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:02.000
<v Speaker 1>did this snake in the tunnel agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>work?</v>

91
00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.863
<v Speaker 1>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now your dividends during the 19 </v>

92
00:05:04.041 --> 00:05:04.874
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European currencies went up and down </v>

93
00:05:06.231 --> 00:05:09.590
<v Speaker 1>like a drunk snake in a very wide </v>
<v Speaker 1>tunnel.</v>

94
00:05:09.591 --> 00:05:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Trying to continue that terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies metaphor.</v>

95
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:16.970
<v Speaker 1>This is why decades later European </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians met again in another room.</v>

96
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:17.863
<v Speaker 1>This time it was 1992 ads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had moved on from the ridiculous </v>

97
00:05:20.931 --> 00:05:21.764
<v Speaker 1>names of the 19 seventies and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to call it the Maastricht </v>

98
00:05:23.871 --> 00:05:24.704
<v Speaker 1>treaty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then this one they got really </v>

99
00:05:25.431 --> 00:05:26.264
<v Speaker 1>serious and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not fool around with any more </v>

100
00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:29.960
<v Speaker 1>snakes than any more tunnels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was weird.</v>

101
00:05:29.961 --> 00:05:31.730
<v Speaker 1>It was the seventies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just,</v>

102
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.160
<v Speaker 1>let's make a currency that everyone can </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

103
00:05:34.161 --> 00:05:37.790
<v Speaker 1>There'll be no more exchange rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there'll be no more fluctuations that we</v>

104
00:05:37.791 --> 00:05:39.920
<v Speaker 1>no more bullshit that we had to deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>with before.</v>

105
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone sound good and then essentially</v>

106
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:45.280
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain post lands up in is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

107
00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.100
<v Speaker 1>I don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't.</v>

108
00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.933
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to end with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really liked my pound sterling and </v>

109
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.710
<v Speaker 1>everyone else in the room was basically </v>
<v Speaker 1>Geico yourself for doing this anyway,</v>

110
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:55.580
<v Speaker 1>and this is how a three step process to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a single currency started.</v>

111
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.983
<v Speaker 1>In 1999,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the stock market started listing in </v>

112
00:06:05.811 --> 00:06:06.644
<v Speaker 1>euros and later on European citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>started using the new coins for their </v>

113
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:11.023
<v Speaker 1>daily traits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we've all gotten used to hearing </v>

114
00:06:13.131 --> 00:06:15.230
<v Speaker 1>about the euro like any other normal </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>

115
00:06:15.231 --> 00:06:17.690
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>

116
00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.643
<v Speaker 1>it was an unprecedented financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiments and this is how the first </v>

117
00:06:22.851 --> 00:06:23.900
<v Speaker 1>critics came to be</v>

118
00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:31.770
<v Speaker 1>exemplifies situation unfavorable to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common currency.</v>

119
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.113
<v Speaker 1>It is composed of separate nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking different languages with </v>

120
00:06:36.181 --> 00:06:37.014
<v Speaker 1>different customs and having citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling far greater loyalty and </v>

121
00:06:40.981 --> 00:06:41.814
<v Speaker 1>attachment to their own country than to </v>
<v Speaker 1>a common market or to the idea of </v>

122
00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:47.810
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Milton Friedman and I am.</v>

123
00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:49.380
<v Speaker 1>One's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>

124
00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:53.310
<v Speaker 1>We're the single currency unless easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we have a single currency,</v>

125
00:06:53.311 --> 00:06:54.144
<v Speaker 1>that German bank we talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have no problems sending money to </v>

126
00:06:57.421 --> 00:07:00.000
<v Speaker 1>an Italian or a green company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

127
00:07:00.001 --> 00:07:00.834
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens then?</v>

128
00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since there's no currency risk of German</v>

129
00:07:02.881 --> 00:07:05.520
<v Speaker 1>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have a lot of money lender to poorer</v>

130
00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greek and Spanish companies.</v>

131
00:07:07.530 --> 00:07:10.080
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rich countries have started to invest in</v>

132
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:14.180
<v Speaker 1>poor countries like there is no tomorrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yet.</v>

133
00:07:14.181 --> 00:07:15.014
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can probably guess what you're </v>

134
00:07:15.061 --> 00:07:17.940
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the problem with all of this?</v>

135
00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:19.860
<v Speaker 1>It sounds pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:07:19.861 --> 00:07:22.040
<v Speaker 1>the problem comes with the crisis.</v>

137
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.460
<v Speaker 1>Banks must take bigger losses on Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>loans,</v>

138
00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:31.563
<v Speaker 1>says German finance minister.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the southern European </v>

139
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:37.300
<v Speaker 1>economies that poor a weekend when </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a crisis,</v>

140
00:07:37.301 --> 00:07:39.430
<v Speaker 1>their companies are the first ones to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt,</v>

141
00:07:39.431 --> 00:07:41.410
<v Speaker 1>so if companies can't pay their debts </v>
<v Speaker 1>back,</v>

142
00:07:41.411 --> 00:07:42.244
<v Speaker 1>the banks can go bankrupt too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is what we call the risk of </v>

143
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:46.653
<v Speaker 1>contagion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why during the 2008 </v>

144
00:07:48.731 --> 00:07:49.564
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so many politicians and economists </v>

145
00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.760
<v Speaker 1>suggested abandoning the euro.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them talked about the creation of</v>

146
00:07:54.761 --> 00:07:55.594
<v Speaker 1>two different years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one for the wealthy countries who are </v>

147
00:07:57.221 --> 00:08:01.690
<v Speaker 1>solid and stable and another kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>shitty year for the poorer countries and</v>

148
00:08:01.691 --> 00:08:04.960
<v Speaker 1>that kind of week a year a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd just be happy to evaluate as they</v>

149
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:06.100
<v Speaker 1>want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

150
00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:06.934
<v Speaker 1>today the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still alive and kicking and it </v>

151
00:08:08.861 --> 00:08:12.550
<v Speaker 1>wasn't split into two different parts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why was this?</v>

152
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's roll into the next section.</v>

153
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:23.920
<v Speaker 1>The chaos critics are rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The European Central Bank,</v>

154
00:08:23.921 --> 00:08:28.270
<v Speaker 1>also known as the ECB is a modern day </v>
<v Speaker 1>tower of Babel.</v>

155
00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:30.450
<v Speaker 1>It works similarly to a country's</v>

156
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.323
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

157
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:38.000
<v Speaker 1>The current president is a man named </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mario Draghi,</v>

158
00:08:38.001 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>and the executive board is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like the executive power,</v>

159
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 1>but there's also a legislative power and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the governing council.</v>

160
00:08:45.170 --> 00:08:48.650
<v Speaker 1>This is where you have representatives </v>
<v Speaker 1>from all of the eurozone countries.</v>

161
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.720
<v Speaker 1>This one from Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one from France,</v>

162
00:08:50.721 --> 00:08:51.800
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Slovenia,</v>

163
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:52.783
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the countries that have the euro as </v>

164
00:08:54.681 --> 00:08:55.514
<v Speaker 1>their currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these guys that the real decision </v>

165
00:08:57.361 --> 00:08:58.194
<v Speaker 1>makers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decide whether to raise or lower </v>

166
00:09:00.151 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>interest rates or prince more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

167
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.390
<v Speaker 1>but before they do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to reach an agreement and this</v>

168
00:09:06.391 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>is where the problems really start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The southern European countries,</v>

169
00:09:09.541 --> 00:09:12.120
<v Speaker 1>they want to print more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the northern neighbors,</v>

170
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.880
<v Speaker 1>they don't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since they can't come to an agreement,</v>

171
00:09:14.910 --> 00:09:17.700
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to make drastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>

172
00:09:22.510 --> 00:09:27.510
<v Speaker 1>Now this is all true and the problem is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well actually where is the problem?</v>

173
00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.223
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where is the problem in having a </v>

174
00:09:30.281 --> 00:09:31.114
<v Speaker 1>currency that cannot be devalued because</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who are in charge of printing is </v>

175
00:09:34.510 --> 00:09:36.340
<v Speaker 1>don't agree with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

176
00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:37.233
<v Speaker 1>isn't this actually a strength?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about this hundreds of </v>

177
00:09:38.951 --> 00:09:42.400
<v Speaker 1>times on visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best currency is the strongest one.</v>

178
00:09:42.401 --> 00:09:44.260
<v Speaker 1>If the value of your money doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

179
00:09:44.261 --> 00:09:45.094
<v Speaker 1>there is low inflation and you can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>your shopping without being afraid of </v>

180
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:49.780
<v Speaker 1>losing all your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could also,</v>

181
00:09:49.781 --> 00:09:50.614
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to start a tech company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you know you can invest long </v>

182
00:09:53.740 --> 00:09:55.360
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>

183
00:09:55.361 --> 00:09:58.390
<v Speaker 1>well Simon is the euro actually that </v>
<v Speaker 1>stable?</v>

184
00:09:58.510 --> 00:09:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a look at this</v>

185
00:09:59.740 --> 00:10:00.573
<v Speaker 3>shops</v>

186
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:08.750
<v Speaker 1>here you can see a comparison between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the monetary supply,</v>

187
00:10:08.751 --> 00:10:09.584
<v Speaker 1>the so-called m two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the ECB and the American Federal </v>

188
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:14.443
<v Speaker 1>Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you see how they go hand in hand in </v>

189
00:10:15.831 --> 00:10:16.664
<v Speaker 1>less than 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the euro has become as solid as the </v>

190
00:10:18.921 --> 00:10:20.090
<v Speaker 1>American dollar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

191
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.933
<v Speaker 1>Europeans have already forgotten what </v>
<v Speaker 1>infection even is for a better </v>

192
00:10:23.991 --> 00:10:24.824
<v Speaker 1>understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American Federal Reserve has two </v>

193
00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:27.793
<v Speaker 1>main goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping inflation low and keeping </v>

194
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:30.283
<v Speaker 1>unemployment low as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>European Central Bank instead has just </v>

195
00:10:33.651 --> 00:10:34.484
<v Speaker 1>one goal on their agenda and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>monetary stability and so far all </v>

196
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.440
<v Speaker 1>they've achieved it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>

197
00:10:39.441 --> 00:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>we can see that the euro is as solid and</v>
<v Speaker 1>abundant as the US dollar,</v>

198
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:44.624
<v Speaker 1>but the question is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could it be even more solid and even </v>

199
00:10:47.631 --> 00:10:51.050
<v Speaker 1>more abundance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the short answer is yeah.</v>

200
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:55.280
<v Speaker 1>Today the eurozone has around $320 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants.</v>

201
00:10:55.340 --> 00:10:57.920
<v Speaker 1>That's almost the same as the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

202
00:10:57.980 --> 00:11:02.210
<v Speaker 1>but despite the European economy being </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller than the American one,</v>

203
00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.910
<v Speaker 1>the euro zone can increase as long as </v>
<v Speaker 1>new countries joining.</v>

204
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:07.320
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

205
00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:11.333
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six new countries have adopted the euro </v>

206
00:11:14.121 --> 00:11:14.954
<v Speaker 1>as their currency and despite the fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the political climate is not </v>

207
00:11:18.051 --> 00:11:23.030
<v Speaker 1>currently very much in favor of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland or the Nordic countries might end</v>

208
00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:25.880
<v Speaker 1>up joining the euro at some point as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

209
00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:28.740
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many other currencies that are</v>

210
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:29.623
<v Speaker 1>linked to the array.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember in a previous video we </v>

211
00:11:31.011 --> 00:11:34.790
<v Speaker 1>talked about French colonies in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that video we said how countries like</v>

212
00:11:34.791 --> 00:11:39.320
<v Speaker 1>the Ivory Coast and Senegal have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>common currency called the CFA franc.</v>

213
00:11:39.380 --> 00:11:43.670
<v Speaker 1>This currency is actually linked to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>euro and we're talking about more than a</v>

214
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:46.990
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50 million people in </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerging economies here.</v>

215
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:49.700
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with so many people using euros in their</v>

216
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:52.250
<v Speaker 1>daily lives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are enough coins out there to make</v>

217
00:11:52.251 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>it easy for any company to get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands on them.</v>

218
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>As an now you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

219
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.191
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm in.</v>

220
00:11:57.191 --> 00:12:00.010
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people do use the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no doubt,</v>

221
00:12:00.011 --> 00:12:03.220
<v Speaker 1>but you know who else has a lot of users</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Chinese yuan.</v>

222
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:04.233
<v Speaker 1>This is also known as the renminbi and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's becoming more and more fashionable </v>

223
00:12:07.601 --> 00:12:08.740
<v Speaker 1>these days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

224
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.700
<v Speaker 1>so why are we using euros instead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Renminbi is well,</v>

225
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:13.683
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

226
00:12:17.070 --> 00:12:19.470
<v Speaker 1>the laws of the UN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

227
00:12:19.500 --> 00:12:22.770
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is full of a lot of people who are</v>

228
00:12:22.771 --> 00:12:24.960
<v Speaker 1>using this currency for that day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You transactions.</v>

229
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.823
<v Speaker 1>This means high demand for this currency</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of notes and lots of coins in </v>

230
00:12:29.341 --> 00:12:30.930
<v Speaker 1>circulation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At first glance,</v>

231
00:12:30.931 --> 00:12:31.764
<v Speaker 1>this should be enough for the nuance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>become an international reserve </v>

232
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:36.780
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a problem.</v>

233
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:40.233
<v Speaker 1>Put 15,000 United States dollars and you</v>
<v Speaker 1>will personal cap on overseas bank card </v>

234
00:12:45.550 --> 00:12:47.410
<v Speaker 1>withdrawals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

235
00:12:47.411 --> 00:12:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ride.</v>

236
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>China does not want us to leave the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

237
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:54.040
<v Speaker 1>This is why they put lots of capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls in place.</v>

238
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:54.903
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finding new ones in the international </v>

239
00:12:55.991 --> 00:12:57.910
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not an easy job.</v>

240
00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.580
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China wants to avoid Chinese businessman</v>

241
00:13:00.581 --> 00:13:02.410
<v Speaker 1>taking money out of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence,</v>

242
00:13:02.411 --> 00:13:03.244
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese People's Bank has lots and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of restrictions and as you can </v>

243
00:13:06.581 --> 00:13:09.160
<v Speaker 1>imagine in a dictatorship like that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese one,</v>

244
00:13:09.310 --> 00:13:12.130
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to believe in the independence</v>
<v Speaker 1>of their central bank.</v>

245
00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.960
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she needed to,</v>

246
00:13:13.961 --> 00:13:14.794
<v Speaker 1>he could simply changed the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just stopped printing as much money as </v>

247
00:13:16.871 --> 00:13:17.704
<v Speaker 1>he wants it.</v>

248
00:13:21.290 --> 00:13:22.360
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

249
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:25.400
<v Speaker 1>the political system doesn't affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency.</v>

250
00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:26.623
<v Speaker 1>If you do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you should probably watch a video on </v>

251
00:13:27.801 --> 00:13:28.634
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all see what happens when you mix </v>

252
00:13:29.990 --> 00:13:34.920
<v Speaker 1>authoritarianism and economic crisis and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not good for now though,</v>

253
00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:35.833
<v Speaker 1>it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the euro can become as </v>

254
00:13:37.341 --> 00:13:38.174
<v Speaker 1>important as the dollar or maybe we see </v>
<v Speaker 1>a brand new crisis destroying the </v>

255
00:13:41.601 --> 00:13:42.434
<v Speaker 1>European single currency.</v>
