1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.610
<v Speaker 1>If I asked you what the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecommerce company in the world was,</v>

2
00:00:02.611 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>I bet most of you would answer Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 1>without even hesitating.</v>

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.830
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might not actually be the case.</v>

4
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:08.723
<v Speaker 1>Listen Up,</v>

5
00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.440
<v Speaker 2>Ali Baba started 18 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We never change.</v>

6
00:00:25.441 --> 00:00:27.450
<v Speaker 2>I'll a drink.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We believe e commerce.</v>

7
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:28.583
<v Speaker 2>We believe Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've been lead by helping young people </v>

8
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:35.040
<v Speaker 2>helping small business and helping </v>
<v Speaker 2>empower women.</v>

9
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 2>We will have the future</v>

10
00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.593
<v Speaker 1>his value of more than $400 billion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 600 million customers </v>

11
00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:48.750
<v Speaker 1>worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ali Baba is an incredible success story.</v>

12
00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.000
<v Speaker 1>That's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Say the most valuable Chinese company in</v>

13
00:00:51.001 --> 00:00:51.834
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can say that this company has become </v>

14
00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:56.880
<v Speaker 1>the best representative of the new form </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Chinese capitalism.</v>

15
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.253
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back for a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the question that we asked at the </v>

16
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:06.714
<v Speaker 1>beginning of this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Amazon the largest ECOMMERCE company </v>

17
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.200
<v Speaker 1>in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.290
<v Speaker 1>that kind of depends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

19
00:01:18.151 --> 00:01:18.984
<v Speaker 1>we take a look at the market value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how much investors value the </v>

20
00:01:21.301 --> 00:01:22.134
<v Speaker 1>company asks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then undoubtedly Amazon is the largest </v>

21
00:01:24.361 --> 00:01:26.940
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if instead we focus on the volume of</v>

22
00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:28.890
<v Speaker 1>sales made through the company every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>

23
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.140
<v Speaker 1>that is where more goods are bought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold.</v>

24
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.410
<v Speaker 1>Then Alibaba wins by a landslide.</v>

25
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

26
00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.110
<v Speaker 1>Salad Baba might not be as popular as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well known as Amazon after all.</v>

27
00:01:41.111 --> 00:01:45.220
<v Speaker 1>It mostly works in the Asian markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but although it may seem far away,</v>

28
00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:50.221
<v Speaker 1>products worth a total of more than $750</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion I sold each year through Alibaba</v>

29
00:01:50.931 --> 00:01:51.850
<v Speaker 1>has different platform.</v>

30
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:56.163
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

31
00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:57.743
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] of you who usually follow </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politics surely won't be </v>

32
00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 1>surprised by what I'm saying.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia is undergoing a revolution,</v>

33
00:02:02.781 --> 00:02:06.080
<v Speaker 1>a take off an unprecedented economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth process.</v>

34
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Every week,</v>

35
00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.303
<v Speaker 1>year around 160 million people leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty behinds and managed to become a </v>

36
00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:12.544
<v Speaker 1>part of the middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>160 million people in Asia alone in the </v>

37
00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.863
<v Speaker 1>next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Countries like the Philippines and </v>

38
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:18.364
<v Speaker 1>Thailand are going to have a middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes as large as those in the United </v>

39
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:22.281
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

40
00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:23.114
<v Speaker 1>the recipe and then there's China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's middle class is absolutely </v>

41
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:28.060
<v Speaker 1>exploding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's taking off almost vertical.</v>

42
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.153
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

43
00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.070
<v Speaker 1>What happens when a person leaves </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty behind and becomes a part of the</v>

44
00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.150
<v Speaker 1>middle class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.013
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means they now have much more money </v>

46
00:02:37.881 --> 00:02:38.714
<v Speaker 1>just fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why their trainees retail </v>

47
00:02:40.431 --> 00:02:41.264
<v Speaker 1>market is multiplied by four in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>five years and why forecasts indicates </v>

48
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.703
<v Speaker 1>that the growth Chinese consumption in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the next three to four years will be </v>

49
00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:52.250
<v Speaker 1>greater than everything the British or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germans consume today.</v>

50
00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who holds both in 70% of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>share in China's ecommerce sector and is</v>

51
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>very well positioned in the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest growing Asian countries?</v>

52
00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.033
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Alibaba to partnerships with </v>

53
00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.203
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadian producers have been able to </v>

54
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:15.001
<v Speaker 1>sell their innovative technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparel and quality fresh food to almost</v>

55
00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:17.643
<v Speaker 1>half a billion Chinese customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure by now you're beginning to see </v>

56
00:03:20.381 --> 00:03:22.580
<v Speaker 1>this company in a rather different</v>

57
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:23.543
<v Speaker 2>light.</v>

58
00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.483
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we take a look at Alibaba has </v>

59
00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:33.470
<v Speaker 1>characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's lice and its dark sides.</v>

60
00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>Let's see how it all began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the history.</v>

61
00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma's mirror</v>

62
00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:46.743
<v Speaker 2>coleman.</v>

63
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Never the best student,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thanks to the foreign tourists.</v>

64
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:53.730
<v Speaker 1>He visited his hometown and especially </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the relationship he developed with an</v>

65
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:55.350
<v Speaker 1>Australian family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma,</v>

66
00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.243
<v Speaker 1>a child born in a humble family just two</v>
<v Speaker 1>years before Mao's cultural revolution </v>

67
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.240
<v Speaker 1>managed to learn English and decried.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the advantages offered by the modern</v>

68
00:04:03.241 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 1>world and as is often the case in life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't formal studies,</v>

69
00:04:07.441 --> 00:04:08.274
<v Speaker 1>but the small experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind we often don't even pay </v>

70
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.670
<v Speaker 1>attention to that fat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The success of the person who is today,</v>

71
00:04:14.671 --> 00:04:19.671
<v Speaker 1>the richest man in all of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 100% made in China.</v>

72
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.580
<v Speaker 1>I learned English myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know nothing about technology.</v>

73
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:24.473
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why Alibaba survived </v>
<v Speaker 1>is because I know nothing about </v>

74
00:04:27.751 --> 00:04:28.584
<v Speaker 1>computers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm like a blind man riding on the back </v>

75
00:04:30.961 --> 00:04:33.090
<v Speaker 1>of a blind tiger.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma,</v>

76
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.193
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the heroes of the new modern </v>

77
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:36.474
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have the opportunity to attend a </v>

78
00:04:37.741 --> 00:04:38.574
<v Speaker 1>good university.</v>

79
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.050
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since he learned English,</v>

80
00:04:40.051 --> 00:04:41.970
<v Speaker 1>he managed to graduate with a teaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>degree,</v>

81
00:04:41.971 --> 00:04:42.804
<v Speaker 1>got a job as a language teacher and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>few years later launched a translation </v>

82
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:46.494
<v Speaker 1>company and it was on a trip to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to perform a translation </v>

83
00:04:49.051 --> 00:04:49.884
<v Speaker 1>service that some friends from Seattle </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed him what was then an incipient </v>

84
00:04:52.681 --> 00:04:55.050
<v Speaker 1>technology called the internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That moments,</v>

85
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:57.210
<v Speaker 1>an idea had jack jacker right in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>face.</v>

86
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.110
<v Speaker 1>I was afraid of touching the computer </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seemed very expensive,</v>

87
00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:02.640
<v Speaker 1>but they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on Jack,</v>

88
00:05:02.641 --> 00:05:04.530
<v Speaker 1>go ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a bomb.</v>

89
00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Then I typed the word beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

90
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:07.713
<v Speaker 1>e,</v>
<v Speaker 1>e r and I could see German and Japanese </v>

91
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.270
<v Speaker 1>beer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not Chinese spear.</v>

92
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Then I typed the word China and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer was no results.</v>

93
00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Then I thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how interesting if we could group all </v>

94
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.820
<v Speaker 1>the companies in China and create a page</v>
<v Speaker 1>for them,</v>

95
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.910
<v Speaker 1>maybe that would achieve something big </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma as that's precisely what he did.</v>

96
00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.580
<v Speaker 1>After returning to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack said,</v>

97
00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.750
<v Speaker 1>Tata Company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China pages to list,</v>

98
00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:30.541
<v Speaker 1>classify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>classifying,</v>

99
00:05:30.541 --> 00:05:33.900
<v Speaker 1>thus find Chinese companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like the yellow pages.</v>

100
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.450
<v Speaker 1>This company didn't have the expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

101
00:05:36.451 --> 00:05:37.284
<v Speaker 1>but Jack Learns enough to be ready for </v>
<v Speaker 1>his next adventure after a lot of work </v>

102
00:05:40.951 --> 00:05:42.780
<v Speaker 1>in a small apartment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if he had a team,</v>

103
00:05:42.781 --> 00:05:43.614
<v Speaker 1>had managed to train without virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>any resources created Alibaba in 1999 </v>

104
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:50.490
<v Speaker 1>and it's now one of the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies on the planet.</v>

105
00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.983
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mark.</v>

106
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.873
<v Speaker 2>Good.</v>

107
00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.230
<v Speaker 1>I'm wondering what Alibaba does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should ask ourselves what doesn't</v>

108
00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:07.203
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

109
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:08.203
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba isn't simply an ecommerce </v>

110
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:10.544
<v Speaker 1>portal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather are kind of technological </v>

111
00:06:12.381 --> 00:06:14.690
<v Speaker 1>intermediary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

112
00:06:14.691 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm like Amazon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba doesn't sell anything directly,</v>

113
00:06:17.481 --> 00:06:18.314
<v Speaker 1>but basically functions as a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>market where thousands and thousands of </v>

114
00:06:21.771 --> 00:06:22.604
<v Speaker 1>brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producers and distribution companies </v>

115
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.630
<v Speaker 1>sell their products to millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>

116
00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:28.820
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba is the owner company,</v>

117
00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:31.260
<v Speaker 1>the company that manages this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>market and supplies.</v>

118
00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:32.113
<v Speaker 1>Everything that brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>producers and distributors need to be </v>

119
00:06:34.131 --> 00:06:37.310
<v Speaker 1>able to carry out their business from </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment platforms to metadata.</v>

120
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.140
<v Speaker 1>This may be it's biggest difference from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon.</v>

121
00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:44.840
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the huge amount of data that</v>

122
00:06:44.841 --> 00:06:46.850
<v Speaker 1>these companies handle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consumer trends,</v>

123
00:06:46.851 --> 00:06:48.350
<v Speaker 1>budgets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>types of customers,</v>

124
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:49.370
<v Speaker 1>purchase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>timing,</v>

125
00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:06:50.211 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>while Amazon uses all that data to </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop his own product lines,</v>

127
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:54.164
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba shares them with the companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>that operate through their markets so </v>

128
00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.070
<v Speaker 1>that they can launch new products or no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their consumers' preferences better runs</v>

129
00:07:01.071 --> 00:07:02.030
<v Speaker 1>with us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell more,</v>

130
00:07:02.031 --> 00:07:04.400
<v Speaker 1>making the market grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes Alibaba Greg.</v>

131
00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:11.460
<v Speaker 1>Thus overtime Alibaba has developed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>several different markets,</v>

132
00:07:11.461 --> 00:07:14.640
<v Speaker 1>so if you'd like to better understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>what Alibaba is exactly.</v>

133
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.060
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at what those markets </v>
<v Speaker 1>are and how they differ.</v>

134
00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:21.170
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have alibaba.com</v>

135
00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:22.033
<v Speaker 1>the huge wholesale markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the largest online wholesale </v>

136
00:07:24.331 --> 00:07:25.164
<v Speaker 1>markets on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to see this market isn't aimed </v>

137
00:07:27.331 --> 00:07:28.164
<v Speaker 1>at consumers through this space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Producers and manufacturers selling </v>

138
00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:31.344
<v Speaker 1>their products in Biloxi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other companies so they can distribute </v>

139
00:07:33.691 --> 00:07:36.540
<v Speaker 1>them in their countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

140
00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 1>say you have a store and you want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>order 5,000</v>

141
00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:42.000
<v Speaker 1>red shirts with a specific logo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the place that you go to.</v>

142
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Unless we use Alibaba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's extremely difficult,</v>

143
00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:47.970
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frustrating to find a supplier.</v>

144
00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.420
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba cut out the middle man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make it extremely easy to find,</v>

145
00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:54.750
<v Speaker 1>communicate and negotiate with suppliers</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly through their website.</v>

146
00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.020
<v Speaker 1>J June businessmen and investor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in China,</v>

147
00:07:58.021 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the local wholesale </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets,</v>

148
00:07:59.911 --> 00:08:02.610
<v Speaker 1>which in this case is known as 1680 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight.com</v>

149
00:08:02.670 --> 00:08:03.503
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba has two of the largest retail </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic commerce or markets in the </v>

150
00:08:07.021 --> 00:08:08.910
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taobao and teamwork.</v>

151
00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:12.120
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

152
00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:15.720
<v Speaker 1>Taobao is pretty much a combination </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Amazon and Ebay.</v>

153
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practically anyone can sell that </v>

154
00:08:17.941 --> 00:08:18.774
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a market with thousands and </v>

155
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:23.550
<v Speaker 1>thousands of suppliers and almost 600 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million active consumers.</v>

156
00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.213
<v Speaker 1>Team old on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a large online shopping center </v>

157
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:28.913
<v Speaker 1>oriented towards big brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brands pay a fee to have their own </v>

158
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.080
<v Speaker 1>store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically like any shopping mall.</v>

159
00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:37.170
<v Speaker 1>Then one of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's an old crown jewels.</v>

160
00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:38.033
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba owns more than 80% of Lazada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most important ecommerce company in </v>

161
00:08:41.941 --> 00:08:42.774
<v Speaker 1>South Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a company that operates in </v>

162
00:08:43.831 --> 00:08:45.570
<v Speaker 1>countries like Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

163
00:08:45.571 --> 00:08:46.470
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore,</v>

164
00:08:46.471 --> 00:08:47.304
<v Speaker 1>and Thailand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And watch out because we aren't talking </v>

165
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:51.990
<v Speaker 1>about something small scale only in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next two to three years,</v>

166
00:08:51.991 --> 00:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>these countries will see them </v>
<v Speaker 1>middleclass multiplied by two discipline</v>

167
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:57.090
<v Speaker 1>us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>400 million people,</v>

168
00:08:57.120 --> 00:09:00.330
<v Speaker 1>400 million people that Alibaba wants to</v>
<v Speaker 1>turn into customers.</v>

169
00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.550
<v Speaker 1>And finally we have what is probably the</v>
<v Speaker 1>best known platform,</v>

170
00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:05.413
<v Speaker 1>but most of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aliexpress and international consumer </v>

171
00:09:07.641 --> 00:09:10.550
<v Speaker 1>oriented platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

172
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:12.830
<v Speaker 1>these folks are Alibaba has mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets,</v>

173
00:09:12.831 --> 00:09:13.664
<v Speaker 1>but the company's activities end that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba is also one of the five most </v>

174
00:09:19.641 --> 00:09:21.860
<v Speaker 1>important power computing companies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

175
00:09:21.861 --> 00:09:24.440
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's trainers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>undisputed leader,</v>

176
00:09:24.470 --> 00:09:28.400
<v Speaker 1>and this division is growth rate has </v>
<v Speaker 1>surpassed 100% annually in recent yet</v>

177
00:09:30.970 --> 00:09:32.710
<v Speaker 1>companies such as kpmg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nestle,</v>

178
00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:33.544
<v Speaker 1>Phillips,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sap already use hourly cloud </v>

179
00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also owns Yukui streaming platform,</v>

180
00:09:40.141 --> 00:09:42.150
<v Speaker 1>similar to youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ele.me,</v>

181
00:09:42.151 --> 00:09:42.984
<v Speaker 1>China's largest home delivery company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which among many other companies also </v>

182
00:09:45.511 --> 00:09:47.460
<v Speaker 1>holds a significant share of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why though?</v>

183
00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Something like the Chinese facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a second,</v>

184
00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:54.630
<v Speaker 1>have any of you heard of Ali pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>those who don't know what it is?</v>

185
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:55.464
<v Speaker 1>Hourly pay is very similar to paypal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has more than 817 million active </v>

186
00:09:58.651 --> 00:09:59.484
<v Speaker 1>users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's the leader in the Chinese </v>

187
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:01.560
<v Speaker 1>mobile payment market.</v>

188
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:03.663
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

189
00:10:05.020 --> 00:10:05.980
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>

190
00:10:05.981 --> 00:10:06.814
<v Speaker 1>credit cards aren't common at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trainees have jumped directly to </v>

191
00:10:09.821 --> 00:10:12.010
<v Speaker 1>mobile payments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when they go to the supermarket,</v>

192
00:10:12.011 --> 00:10:13.930
<v Speaker 1>instead of paying with visa or </v>
<v Speaker 1>mastercard,</v>

193
00:10:13.931 --> 00:10:16.480
<v Speaker 1>they use Ali pay or we chats payment </v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

194
00:10:16.481 --> 00:10:19.240
<v Speaker 1>The two main payment systems in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese market,</v>

195
00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:20.133
<v Speaker 1>while Alibaba owns 33% of ANZ financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company that owns alipay and also </v>

196
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:28.240
<v Speaker 1>pate and the leading mobile payments </v>
<v Speaker 1>application in India.</v>

197
00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:29.103
<v Speaker 1>And I've a strongly growing markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea of what this means </v>

198
00:10:31.601 --> 00:10:36.190
<v Speaker 1>as financials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated value surpasses $150 billion.</v>

199
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Just a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because if this entire online bet wasn't</v>

200
00:10:41.281 --> 00:10:42.114
<v Speaker 1>enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba is also investing billions in </v>

201
00:10:43.891 --> 00:10:47.340
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets and other physical stores </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it has its own brand.</v>

202
00:10:47.390 --> 00:10:51.390
<v Speaker 1>Hema is also the largest shareholder in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sun art retail group,</v>

203
00:10:51.391 --> 00:10:54.530
<v Speaker 1>the largest supermarkets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hypermarkets operator in all of it,</v>

204
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.403
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

205
00:10:56.750 --> 00:10:57.583
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Alibaba or empire extends its </v>

206
00:10:59.151 --> 00:11:02.640
<v Speaker 1>tentacles into a lot of Saturday things </v>
<v Speaker 1>up.</v>

207
00:11:02.641 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba has services equivalent to those</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Amazon,</v>

208
00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>Ebay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justi,</v>

209
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.080
<v Speaker 1>visa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube,</v>

210
00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:07.914
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even cough or all in the same </v>

211
00:11:09.811 --> 00:11:11.610
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not bad.</v>

212
00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:12.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is precisely why this company is </v>

213
00:11:13.621 --> 00:11:17.070
<v Speaker 1>worth more than $400 billion on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market,</v>

214
00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:21.030
<v Speaker 1>but I don't think we can end this story </v>
<v Speaker 1>without talking about the future.</v>

215
00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

216
00:11:28.450 --> 00:11:33.310
<v Speaker 1>risks and opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at it,</v>

217
00:11:33.311 --> 00:11:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba has plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very ambitious,</v>

218
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.510
<v Speaker 2>bye.</v>

219
00:11:38.510 --> 00:11:39.343
<v Speaker 1>20 sales made through Alibaba is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different platforms will exceed $1 </v>

220
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:43.843
<v Speaker 1>trillion just 18 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The company aims to surpass 2 billion </v>

221
00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:51.534
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>

222
00:11:59.050 --> 00:11:59.480
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

223
00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:00.480
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the goal,</v>

224
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.060
<v Speaker 1>but will they achieve it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:12:02.061 --> 00:12:02.894
<v Speaker 1>obviously we can't know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that it has many cards </v>

226
00:12:04.941 --> 00:12:05.840
<v Speaker 1>on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

227
00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:06.703
<v Speaker 1>despite this company's huge growth since</v>
<v Speaker 1>its foundation in 1999 it still has </v>

228
00:12:10.461 --> 00:12:11.510
<v Speaker 1>great potential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

229
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:12.353
<v Speaker 1>do I need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because ecommerce is growing a lot </v>

230
00:12:13.611 --> 00:12:14.444
<v Speaker 1>around the welds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because everything indicates </v>

231
00:12:16.101 --> 00:12:19.160
<v Speaker 1>that growth will be explosive for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

232
00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:20.900
<v Speaker 1>particularly in this region.</v>

233
00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:23.990
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

234
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.990
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba is a main market here.</v>

235
00:12:25.991 --> 00:12:30.720
<v Speaker 1>The Internet has only expanded by 55% so</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still a lot of work to do.</v>

236
00:12:30.750 --> 00:12:31.583
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about hundreds of millions</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people who will sooner or later </v>

237
00:12:34.051 --> 00:12:37.710
<v Speaker 1>connect to the Internet and start making</v>
<v Speaker 1>that first online purchases.</v>

238
00:12:39.410 --> 00:12:40.243
<v Speaker 1>I'm not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given that Chinese purchasing power is </v>

239
00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:42.954
<v Speaker 1>growing stronger year after year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same is happening with the average </v>

240
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:46.703
<v Speaker 1>amount of purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See it since 2015 the average Ali Baba </v>

241
00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.920
<v Speaker 1>customers spending has grown by 50% in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

242
00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:55.530
<v Speaker 1>So if we combine more spending and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>clients,</v>

243
00:12:55.560 --> 00:12:56.393
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see how enormous the potential </v>

244
00:12:58.171 --> 00:12:59.004
<v Speaker 1>is here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then in addition that rob the </v>

245
00:13:02.401 --> 00:13:06.510
<v Speaker 1>countries which belonged to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Association of Southeast Asian Nations,</v>

246
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.540
<v Speaker 1>also India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about an area of the world</v>

247
00:13:09.541 --> 00:13:11.850
<v Speaker 1>that is not only going to see a huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth,</v>

248
00:13:11.851 --> 00:13:12.684
<v Speaker 1>but it's also estimated to grow by more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 700 million people in the next </v>

249
00:13:15.811 --> 00:13:18.210
<v Speaker 1>three decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this is of course,</v>

250
00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.430
<v Speaker 1>in addition to the international market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

251
00:13:20.490 --> 00:13:23.040
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because everything's not so rosy.</v>

252
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:23.903
<v Speaker 1>Like many Internet companies who focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>all their attention on growing and </v>

253
00:13:26.221 --> 00:13:27.054
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company isn't actually making much </v>

254
00:13:28.351 --> 00:13:29.184
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

255
00:13:38.090 --> 00:13:38.923
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're talking about a $400 billion </v>

256
00:13:40.551 --> 00:13:41.384
<v Speaker 1>company that has barely managed to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a net profit of eight point $4 billion </v>

257
00:13:44.361 --> 00:13:45.194
<v Speaker 1>in the last 12 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that might sound like a lot of </v>

258
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:50.180
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the market value is 50 times in that</v>

259
00:13:50.181 --> 00:13:51.560
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's a lot.</v>

260
00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:52.940
<v Speaker 1>And of course one may think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

261
00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:53.351
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

262
00:13:53.351 --> 00:13:54.320
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so what,</v>

263
00:13:54.321 --> 00:13:56.150
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's definitely gonna make money </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

264
00:13:56.330 --> 00:13:58.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe or maybe not,</v>

265
00:13:58.820 --> 00:13:59.653
<v Speaker 1>because if the market grows so much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it usually entails a very strong </v>

266
00:14:01.881 --> 00:14:04.400
<v Speaker 1>incentives for you competitors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new rivals,</v>

267
00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:06.910
<v Speaker 1>something that is already happening in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

268
00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:07.744
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

269
00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:09.063
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

270
00:14:09.260 --> 00:14:10.640
<v Speaker 1>Competitors like J d.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dot.</v>

271
00:14:10.641 --> 00:14:14.360
<v Speaker 1>Coleman does specialty pin duo duo are </v>
<v Speaker 1>investing a lot of money to compete with</v>

272
00:14:14.361 --> 00:14:17.330
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though they aren't very successful,</v>

273
00:14:17.331 --> 00:14:19.880
<v Speaker 1>they may never beat Alibaba are off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe they will.</v>

274
00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.790
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that the massive water,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it adds more pressure to the markets,</v>

275
00:14:22.791 --> 00:14:26.480
<v Speaker 1>which may reduce the margins in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies operate in the future.</v>

276
00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.433
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

277
00:14:29.190 --> 00:14:30.590
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the Chinese government,</v>

278
00:14:30.591 --> 00:14:33.500
<v Speaker 1>which as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is not exactly the best guarantor in the</v>

279
00:14:33.501 --> 00:14:34.730
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know.</v>

280
00:14:34.731 --> 00:14:35.564
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese government doesn't undoes </v>
<v Speaker 1>things as it pleases and they can even </v>

281
00:14:38.481 --> 00:14:41.120
<v Speaker 1>determine who survives in a market and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do doesn't.</v>

282
00:14:41.270 --> 00:14:42.103
<v Speaker 1>That means that a botched delivery to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist party leader could become </v>

283
00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.910
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba's worst nightmare.</v>

284
00:14:51.830 --> 00:14:52.070
<v Speaker 2>In any</v>

285
00:14:52.070 --> 00:14:52.903
<v Speaker 1>case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that Alibaba is the best </v>

286
00:14:53.961 --> 00:14:54.794
<v Speaker 1>example of the changes that are weld is </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing how Asia is gaining power </v>

287
00:14:59.061 --> 00:15:03.600
<v Speaker 1>and how it's beginning to acquire its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own large multinationals ends.</v>

288
00:15:03.670 --> 00:15:04.503
<v Speaker 1>It's something we're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get used to because I really hope you </v>
