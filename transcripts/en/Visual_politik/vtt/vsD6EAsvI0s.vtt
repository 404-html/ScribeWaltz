00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.973
<v Speaker 2>They're all team types of companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those that sell a product to a customer </v>

3
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 2>and those where the customer is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>product.</v>

4
00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:15.630
<v Speaker 2>Tinder belongs to the second group.</v>

5
00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.690
<v Speaker 2>Why would you choose tinder before any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other dating app?</v>

6
00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the answers.</v>

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.540
<v Speaker 2>That's pretty simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's because it's full of users.</v>

8
00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:29.350
<v Speaker 2>This means that the real product,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is not a website or a service.</v>

9
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.440
<v Speaker 2>Do you have you on tinder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the product is you,</v>

10
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:35.200
<v Speaker 2>and here is where the big question comes</v>
<v Speaker 2>in.</v>

11
00:00:35.201 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 2>How would you start a dating app?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

12
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.900
<v Speaker 2>imagine you and your friends decide to </v>
<v Speaker 2>start a company like tinder.</v>

13
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first thing you need is lots of </v>

14
00:00:42.551 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 2>people using it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

15
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.434
<v Speaker 2>But these men and women then are going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to use it if they don't see a lot of </v>

16
00:00:46.931 --> 00:00:49.900
<v Speaker 2>other men and women using it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see where I'm coming from here?</v>

17
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.823
<v Speaker 2>This is why tinder with over 200 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>users is one of the most surprising </v>

18
00:00:53.981 --> 00:00:58.981
<v Speaker 2>successes in business history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did they get started?</v>

19
00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.250
<v Speaker 2>What did they do better than their </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitors?</v>

20
00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:08.580
<v Speaker 2>Well today we're going to answer this </v>
<v Speaker 2>question and in order to do so,</v>

21
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.850
<v Speaker 2>we're going to ask one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>experts in the industry,</v>

22
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 2>and that's Mark Brooks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who's the president of idea,</v>

23
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.790
<v Speaker 2>a group that represents the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating apps on the planet.</v>

24
00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:18.683
<v Speaker 2>He has spent more than 25 years in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>online love industry and he's also the </v>

25
00:01:22.591 --> 00:01:25.550
<v Speaker 2>brains behind many of the dating sites </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you probably know</v>

26
00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.680
<v Speaker 3>Hello Simon and the hell is all of </v>
<v Speaker 3>visual politics subscribers.</v>

27
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.543
<v Speaker 3>As you said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the key to being successful with a </v>

28
00:01:30.481 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 3>dating service is as we call it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>having a critical mass of activity.</v>

29
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.843
<v Speaker 3>This means having enough active users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so on average one out of five messages </v>

30
00:01:39.301 --> 00:01:40.134
<v Speaker 3>get an answer.</v>

31
00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:45.533
<v Speaker 2>How'd you get there?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where economics strategy and </v>

32
00:01:48.151 --> 00:01:50.790
<v Speaker 2>math comes into play and you might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>wondering,</v>

33
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.770
<v Speaker 2>why are we talking about this on visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics?</v>

34
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.623
<v Speaker 2>What does tinder have to do with all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the things we usually cover on this </v>

35
00:01:57.481 --> 00:01:58.470
<v Speaker 2>channel?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

36
00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.860
<v Speaker 2>actually a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Listen up in this survey,</v>

37
00:02:01.861 --> 00:02:05.760
<v Speaker 2>one out of five heterosexual couples in </v>
<v Speaker 2>America got to know each other through a</v>

38
00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:08.310
<v Speaker 2>dating site.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the case of same sex couples,</v>

39
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.490
<v Speaker 2>this figure is more than 70% in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>words,</v>

40
00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.420
<v Speaker 2>dating online has changed our society </v>
<v Speaker 2>and this,</v>

41
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 3>this is also politics nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>despite what it looks like,</v>

42
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.220
<v Speaker 3>the online dating industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's still a virgin industry.</v>

43
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:22.083
<v Speaker 3>In total.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We make around $5 billion a year around </v>

44
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.380
<v Speaker 3>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which isn't that much really relative to</v>

45
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 3>other industries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

46
00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.000
<v Speaker 3>the underwear industry has more than 10 </v>
<v Speaker 3>times bigger than the online.</v>

47
00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:31.930
<v Speaker 3>Personal is industry.</v>

48
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.100
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>

49
00:02:38.101 --> 00:02:42.100
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about an industry where </v>
<v Speaker 2>making a profit is seldom easy.</v>

50
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.870
<v Speaker 3>Besides that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's a hyper concentrated industry.</v>

51
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 3>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of the dating sites,</v>

52
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:47.504
<v Speaker 3>including tinder,</v>
<v Speaker 3>belong to the very same group match </v>

53
00:02:49.821 --> 00:02:52.370
<v Speaker 3>group.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a Nasdaq listed company that has</v>

54
00:02:52.371 --> 00:02:55.220
<v Speaker 3>smashed or required most of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitors at this stage,</v>

55
00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.150
<v Speaker 3>but still the middle</v>

56
00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 2>question is how did the tinder creators </v>
<v Speaker 2>managed to such a successful app?</v>

57
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.983
<v Speaker 2>What kind of lessons can we learn from </v>
<v Speaker 2>tinder that could be applied to other </v>

58
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:05.914
<v Speaker 2>kinds of businesses?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well today we're going to answer these </v>

59
00:03:08.021 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>

60
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.310
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The love,</v>

61
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:20.690
<v Speaker 2>the Haemus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

62
00:03:20.691 --> 00:03:25.250
<v Speaker 2>I know it won't come as a surprise if I </v>
<v Speaker 2>tell you that dating sites are as old as</v>

63
00:03:25.251 --> 00:03:26.084
<v Speaker 2>the Internet itself for a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding in the year 1991 Tim ben </v>

64
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:31.640
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he created the first website in history,</v>

65
00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 2>well three years later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first dating site,</v>

66
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:37.583
<v Speaker 2>whether personals was launched.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you can imagine we all just </v>

67
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:42.700
<v Speaker 2>talking about finding your significant </v>
<v Speaker 2>other at the time.</v>

68
00:03:42.701 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>Other sides like adult friend finder </v>
<v Speaker 2>where created to</v>

69
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:46.653
<v Speaker 3>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>most of these websites were pretty </v>

70
00:03:48.281 --> 00:03:49.114
<v Speaker 3>rudimentary back then.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nobody talked about user experience or </v>

71
00:03:51.581 --> 00:03:55.150
<v Speaker 3>complex algorithms were personal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So there's just an online version of the</v>

72
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 3>good old classified ads that you had an </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspapers,</v>

73
00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.000
<v Speaker 3>but you could search more quickly and </v>
<v Speaker 3>send messages to the contacts,</v>

74
00:04:01.001 --> 00:04:04.660
<v Speaker 3>which was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And overall the biggest problem was they</v>

75
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:06.110
<v Speaker 3>had very few users.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hmm.</v>

76
00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:13.550
<v Speaker 3>And most of the cases you would create a</v>
<v Speaker 3>profile and find just a few geeks today.</v>

77
00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.580
<v Speaker 3>But all of this changed with the advent </v>
<v Speaker 3>of match.com match.</v>

78
00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.750
<v Speaker 3>The comb was the real game changer that </v>
<v Speaker 3>make no mistake,</v>

79
00:04:24.751 --> 00:04:27.870
<v Speaker 3>they didn't have an especially good </v>
<v Speaker 3>algorithm or a better user experience.</v>

80
00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.150
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>their asset was just one word.</v>

81
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.373
<v Speaker 3>Money match.com started out with just a </v>
<v Speaker 3>small improvement over the classified </v>

82
00:04:40.541 --> 00:04:41.374
<v Speaker 3>ads in newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they realize the future was online </v>

83
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:44.433
<v Speaker 3>during the early years.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They tried different formulas for the </v>

84
00:04:46.451 --> 00:04:47.284
<v Speaker 3>turning point came in the year 1999 that</v>
<v Speaker 3>was the year when I see a multinational </v>

85
00:04:51.341 --> 00:04:54.550
<v Speaker 3>Bolton mashed or calm for $50 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>and believe me,</v>

86
00:04:54.551 --> 00:04:56.620
<v Speaker 3>that was enough money to do great </v>
<v Speaker 3>things.</v>

87
00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:57.593
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden this company could </v>
<v Speaker 2>invest heavily in advertising and this </v>

88
00:05:00.121 --> 00:05:00.954
<v Speaker 2>advertising budget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let them get to that critical mass </v>

89
00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.490
<v Speaker 2>sooner than anybody else,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only that.</v>

90
00:05:05.491 --> 00:05:06.324
<v Speaker 2>match.com was the first one to import </v>
<v Speaker 2>the concepts of the white label to the </v>

91
00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:15.561
<v Speaker 2>dating world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what made match.com so unique?</v>

92
00:05:16.201 --> 00:05:17.034
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had technology to improve online </v>

93
00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:20.220
<v Speaker 2>dating,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what did they need while they needed</v>

94
00:05:20.221 --> 00:05:23.040
<v Speaker 2>more users and who had the most users </v>
<v Speaker 2>back then?</v>

95
00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 2>While that would be msn.com remember old</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft and messenger?</v>

96
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.593
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then this was the most used </v>

97
00:05:28.861 --> 00:05:29.694
<v Speaker 2>messaging software on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were having to offer a brand new </v>

98
00:05:32.521 --> 00:05:37.521
<v Speaker 2>dating service to their users and this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is why msn personals was nothing but the</v>

99
00:05:37.561 --> 00:05:40.260
<v Speaker 2>match.com engine with another logo</v>

100
00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:42.680
<v Speaker 3>with this aggressive strategy manager </v>
<v Speaker 3>come close,</v>

101
00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:45.540
<v Speaker 3>similar deals with other Internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>juggernauts like Yahoo.</v>

102
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.630
<v Speaker 3>And this is how in so little time they </v>
<v Speaker 3>smashed the competitors.</v>

103
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:49.500
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>

104
00:05:49.501 --> 00:05:53.250
<v Speaker 3>this company is so big,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's listed on the Nasdaq index and they</v>

105
00:05:53.251 --> 00:05:55.410
<v Speaker 3>represent one fifth of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

106
00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

107
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.910
<v Speaker 2>I ain't know what you now thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who could compete with such a ban off at</v>

108
00:06:04.911 --> 00:06:05.744
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day with so much money </v>
<v Speaker 2>for advertising and the power to close </v>

109
00:06:08.751 --> 00:06:09.584
<v Speaker 2>the best business deals?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who could come out from under that </v>

110
00:06:12.231 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 2>shadow?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

111
00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:15.290
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the battle,</v>

112
00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:17.180
<v Speaker 2>it had only just started</v>

113
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:19.730
<v Speaker 3>despite mashed up calm being such a big </v>
<v Speaker 3>company,</v>

114
00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:22.190
<v Speaker 3>the service was pretty lame.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is true.</v>

115
00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:25.040
<v Speaker 3>They had lots of users,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but a minority of people found a natural</v>

116
00:06:25.041 --> 00:06:25.874
<v Speaker 3>match.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This explained why the retention rates </v>

117
00:06:27.231 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 3>were so low.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

118
00:06:28.731 --> 00:06:31.970
<v Speaker 3>people signed up into metro con and they</v>
<v Speaker 3>left after just three months.</v>

119
00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 3>Most what does satisfied</v>

120
00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>this left a big vacuum for a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitor with a better strategy.</v>

121
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:43.470
<v Speaker 2>And the winning strategy was we do </v>
<v Speaker 2>promise and over deliver.</v>

122
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 2>Imagine we start a business to make </v>
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>

123
00:06:49.510 --> 00:06:51.970
<v Speaker 2>The logical move would be to get paid </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the service.</v>

124
00:06:51.971 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well it doesn't actually have to be that</v>

125
00:06:54.581 --> 00:06:56.500
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The founders of plenty of fish.</v>

126
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.540
<v Speaker 2>A proofing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

127
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.713
<v Speaker 2>2003 this website was the first one to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer their services completely for </v>

128
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.270
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did they make money?</v>

129
00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer that's kind of obvious.</v>

130
00:07:10.011 --> 00:07:11.120
<v Speaker 2>It's bad advertising.</v>

131
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.160
<v Speaker 3>Many of you will not be surprised with </v>
<v Speaker 3>this,</v>

132
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.000
<v Speaker 3>but back in the time this was a </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolutionary idea being based on ads.</v>

133
00:07:17.001 --> 00:07:20.810
<v Speaker 3>Plenty of fish was heavily incentivized </v>
<v Speaker 3>to make sure the users would spend a lot</v>

134
00:07:20.811 --> 00:07:23.780
<v Speaker 3>of time on the site.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The longer they use the service,</v>

135
00:07:23.810 --> 00:07:26.150
<v Speaker 3>the more ads they would see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this is not</v>

136
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The strategy of plenty of fish could not</v>

137
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:32.300
<v Speaker 2>be more counter intuitive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here's a question.</v>

138
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:35.090
<v Speaker 2>Let's say that you're starting your own </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating site.</v>

139
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.580
<v Speaker 2>What kind of pictures would you put it </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the front page?</v>

140
00:07:37.581 --> 00:07:41.600
<v Speaker 2>Would you pick ugly or beautiful people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you use an attractive,</v>

141
00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 2>elegant web design or a very simple and </v>
<v Speaker 2>sketchy one?</v>

142
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my guess is you'd go for beautiful </v>

143
00:07:51.091 --> 00:07:52.890
<v Speaker 2>people in a smart design,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

144
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:53.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually plenty of fish did the </v>

145
00:07:55.171 --> 00:07:56.004
<v Speaker 2>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their motto was happy are those with no </v>

146
00:07:58.111 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 2>expectations because they will never be </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointed.</v>

147
00:08:01.350 --> 00:08:03.570
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>under promise and over deliver.</v>

148
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:06.450
<v Speaker 3>In order to avoid the website taking </v>
<v Speaker 3>forever to download.</v>

149
00:08:06.451 --> 00:08:08.760
<v Speaker 3>Plenty of fish wander to use low res </v>
<v Speaker 3>pictures.</v>

150
00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:10.590
<v Speaker 3>There's men are very unattractive </v>
<v Speaker 3>design.</v>

151
00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:14.400
<v Speaker 3>They made sure where their users that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they wouldn't find top models,</v>

152
00:08:14.401 --> 00:08:17.040
<v Speaker 3>but they'd find normal people,</v>
<v Speaker 3>real people,</v>

153
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.950
<v Speaker 3>even their orange made clear that they </v>
<v Speaker 3>didn't want to lie to anybody.</v>

154
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.340
<v Speaker 3>Plenty of fish,</v>
<v Speaker 3>simple free,</v>

155
00:08:22.610 --> 00:08:23.443
<v Speaker 3>and it works.</v>

156
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:27.020
<v Speaker 2>This model was so disruptive that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>soon found imitators.</v>

157
00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.810
<v Speaker 2>Other websites like purdue followed in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their footsteps.</v>

158
00:08:29.870 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 2>And guess what happens when plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>fish became successful?</v>

159
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:36.680
<v Speaker 2>Well match.com the ban off of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry does not like competitors,</v>

160
00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:38.930
<v Speaker 2>so they made them an offer they couldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>refuse.</v>

161
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Basically they did a buy them for what </v>
<v Speaker 2>the company was worth,</v>

162
00:08:41.991 --> 00:08:42.824
<v Speaker 2>but by the amounts of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>match.com was losing by having them as </v>

163
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:48.680
<v Speaker 2>competitors and well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a lot of money,</v>

164
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:49.783
<v Speaker 2>but many of you might believe that with </v>
<v Speaker 2>such a solid business model and as a </v>

165
00:08:52.131 --> 00:08:55.770
<v Speaker 2>part of match.com nobody could take on </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of fish rice.</v>

166
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Well you aren't wrong ones again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tindering outside of the box.</v>

167
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.180
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's true.</v>

168
00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 2>Fancier fish seems like the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>

169
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 2>Millions of users,</v>
<v Speaker 2>simple design,</v>

170
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 2>happy customers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But there was a problem.</v>

171
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.640
<v Speaker 2>It didn't work on mobile phones and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>if this wasn't enough and everything was</v>

172
00:09:17.641 --> 00:09:20.040
<v Speaker 2>proud of the fact that they were using </v>
<v Speaker 2>plenty of fish.</v>

173
00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:20.903
<v Speaker 2>Now I know this is probably going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise the millennials watching this </v>

174
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:24.660
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but until recently,</v>

175
00:09:24.661 --> 00:09:28.720
<v Speaker 2>the online dating industry was kind of a</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty shameful pastime.</v>

176
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 2>And the last thing that you'd confessed </v>
<v Speaker 2>to your friends,</v>

177
00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.580
<v Speaker 3>and this is when the tinder founders </v>
<v Speaker 3>came in ready to change the rules of the</v>

178
00:09:34.581 --> 00:09:35.414
<v Speaker 3>game forever.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Tinder was the first dating APP design </v>

179
00:09:39.891 --> 00:09:42.980
<v Speaker 3>that we've fully mobile first.</v>
<v Speaker 3>No computers or laptops,</v>

180
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.903
<v Speaker 3>just cell phones.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And how do you think they got what that </v>

181
00:09:46.341 --> 00:09:47.900
<v Speaker 3>critical mass of users?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

182
00:09:47.901 --> 00:09:49.700
<v Speaker 3>you might think that being an internet </v>
<v Speaker 3>app,</v>

183
00:09:49.701 --> 00:09:51.620
<v Speaker 3>they use online ads to promote </v>
<v Speaker 3>themselves.</v>

184
00:09:51.621 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the opposite was true.</v>

185
00:09:56.530 --> 00:09:56.960
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

186
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.793
<v Speaker 2>The strategy of tinder was 100% offline </v>
<v Speaker 2>instead of ads or big marketing </v>

187
00:10:01.371 --> 00:10:03.860
<v Speaker 2>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tinder founders organized parties at</v>

188
00:10:03.861 --> 00:10:04.694
<v Speaker 2>American universities more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Exactly the coolest fraternities and </v>

189
00:10:07.971 --> 00:10:08.804
<v Speaker 2>sororities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you wanted to attend to the most </v>

190
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:11.114
<v Speaker 2>glamorous parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you had to download the APP to your </v>

191
00:10:12.711 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 2>mobile phone and it wasn't sold as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating APP.</v>

192
00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:17.090
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was a game.</v>

193
00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.053
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the goal of the 10 to founders was not </v>

194
00:10:19.201 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 3>to sell true level of significant </v>
<v Speaker 3>others.</v>

195
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:23.220
<v Speaker 3>The motto was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we are playing tinder.</v>

196
00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.293
<v Speaker 3>Let's play and see who is the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>popular in the party would have put it </v>

197
00:10:26.581 --> 00:10:27.414
<v Speaker 3>on their own terms.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's see who gets the biggest share of </v>

198
00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:30.393
<v Speaker 3>life.</v>

199
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.610
<v Speaker 2>The idea of competing for popularity was</v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing new.</v>

200
00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:37.473
<v Speaker 2>Mother websites like hot or not offered </v>
<v Speaker 2>people the chance to upload their </v>

201
00:10:39.761 --> 00:10:40.594
<v Speaker 2>pictures so others could rank them from </v>
<v Speaker 2>zero to 10 but tins are made everything </v>

202
00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.150
<v Speaker 2>simpler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't about ranking,</v>

203
00:10:46.151 --> 00:10:46.984
<v Speaker 2>but instead it was a matter of yes or no</v>
<v Speaker 2>or in tinder towns swipe right or swipe </v>

204
00:10:51.971 --> 00:10:52.804
<v Speaker 2>left</v>

205
00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:56.973
<v Speaker 3>often does real success can be explained</v>
<v Speaker 3>with the theories at the so called </v>

206
00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:00.534
<v Speaker 3>behavioral economist.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Authors like Daniel Conaman talk about </v>

207
00:11:03.031 --> 00:11:05.220
<v Speaker 3>two kinds of behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 3>some of the basics</v>

208
00:11:05.310 --> 00:11:10.310
<v Speaker 4>in NATO operations functions that we </v>
<v Speaker 4>have such as perceiving things,</v>

209
00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:16.040
<v Speaker 4>having emotional reactions to things.</v>
<v Speaker 4>All this is system one.</v>

210
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 4>We don't choose what just happens to us.</v>

211
00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:20.373
<v Speaker 3>The so called system one or intuitive </v>
<v Speaker 3>fast decision making and the so called </v>

212
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:26.950
<v Speaker 3>system to all logical and slow decision </v>
<v Speaker 3>making.</v>

213
00:11:27.130 --> 00:11:30.790
<v Speaker 3>By limiting the range of choices,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we can easily approach people's emotions</v>

214
00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:31.733
<v Speaker 3>easier.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So tend to dumb down decision making to </v>

215
00:11:33.161 --> 00:11:34.950
<v Speaker 3>the purest emotional element element.</v>

216
00:11:35.190 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mobile first design,</v>

217
00:11:36.991 --> 00:11:40.300
<v Speaker 2>gamification and perfect expansion </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy made at tinder,</v>

218
00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.750
<v Speaker 2>the most loved APP in American </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities.</v>

219
00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 2>Instead of hiding it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>people told everybody they were using it</v>

220
00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:47.460
<v Speaker 2>and at the end of the day it wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>dating.</v>

221
00:11:47.461 --> 00:11:49.680
<v Speaker 2>It was a game.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were playing tinder,</v>

222
00:11:49.830 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 2>and guess what happens after tinder </v>
<v Speaker 2>achieved so much success.</v>

223
00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:57.370
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>

224
00:11:57.371 --> 00:12:00.610
<v Speaker 2>match.com the lovebam off bought them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

225
00:12:00.611 --> 00:12:03.400
<v Speaker 2>most of the dating apps today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a part of the very same group,</v>

226
00:12:03.430 --> 00:12:08.430
<v Speaker 2>and this is why we can still say the </v>
<v Speaker 2>story doesn't end here after 25 years,</v>

227
00:12:11.841 --> 00:12:12.674
<v Speaker 2>the dating app industry is still taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>baby steps and this is because it's one </v>

228
00:12:15.561 --> 00:12:20.000
<v Speaker 2>of the few businesses where people </v>
<v Speaker 2>success is punished instead of rewarded.</v>

229
00:12:25.810 --> 00:12:28.420
<v Speaker 3>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>What would be the best app for dating?</v>

230
00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:29.613
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the one that lets you find your </v>

231
00:12:30.581 --> 00:12:31.840
<v Speaker 3>significant other,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

232
00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.000
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you find your match on tinder,</v>

233
00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.010
<v Speaker 3>the next thing you'll do is leave the </v>
<v Speaker 3>APP.</v>

234
00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.310
<v Speaker 3>This way the company stops making money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is crazy.</v>

235
00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:40.413
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the incentive for a dating app is quite </v>

236
00:12:42.071 --> 00:12:42.904
<v Speaker 3>broken.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If they can help you find your true </v>

237
00:12:44.501 --> 00:12:46.930
<v Speaker 3>love,</v>
<v Speaker 3>then you're off never to return.</v>

238
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:47.873
<v Speaker 2>In economic terms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this means the dating app market is far </v>

239
00:12:50.101 --> 00:12:50.934
<v Speaker 2>from mature.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's still a lot of space for new </v>

240
00:12:53.041 --> 00:12:53.874
<v Speaker 2>players.</v>

241
00:12:57.870 --> 00:12:58.703
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>one of the tinder craze has left the </v>

242
00:12:59.731 --> 00:13:01.890
<v Speaker 3>company after a sexual harassment </v>
<v Speaker 3>lawsuit.</v>

243
00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:03.930
<v Speaker 3>She created her own app called the </v>
<v Speaker 3>bumble.</v>

244
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.980
<v Speaker 3>This APP is completely innovative </v>
<v Speaker 3>because here women are the ones who must</v>

245
00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:09.030
<v Speaker 3>send the first message.</v>

246
00:13:10.330 --> 00:13:11.163
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

247
00:13:12.330 --> 00:13:14.440
<v Speaker 2>And of course there's also facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

248
00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:15.333
<v Speaker 2>You heard me right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Facebook has already announced they </v>

249
00:13:16.721 --> 00:13:18.370
<v Speaker 2>would have launched their own dating </v>
<v Speaker 2>site.</v>

250
00:13:18.670 --> 00:13:22.780
<v Speaker 2>They have the information that Melville </v>
<v Speaker 2>users and the money to make a 180 degree</v>

251
00:13:22.781 --> 00:13:25.840
<v Speaker 2>shift to an industry that despite having</v>
<v Speaker 2>millions of users,</v>

252
00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:28.360
<v Speaker 2>makes them less than $5 billion a year.</v>

253
00:13:33.570 --> 00:13:33.910

255
00:13:36.551 --> 00:13:37.384
<v Speaker 2>for tinder or match.com do you think </v>
<v Speaker 2>online dating will become the preferred </v>
