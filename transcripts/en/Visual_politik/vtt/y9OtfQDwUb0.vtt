1
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.850
<v Speaker 1>There's the world's getting better or </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>

2
00:00:09.851 --> 00:00:13.540
<v Speaker 1>is globalization good or bad is the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>we relate to each other?</v>

3
00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.233
<v Speaker 1>Seem like simple questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they're answers concealed very </v>

4
00:00:19.241 --> 00:00:21.940
<v Speaker 1>divergent ways by which we understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

5
00:00:21.941 --> 00:00:23.770
<v Speaker 1>For those who regularly follow this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

6
00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.040
<v Speaker 1>I'm convinced that you know that we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite optimistic.</v>

7
00:00:27.041 --> 00:00:29.950
<v Speaker 1>Here abouts are planets in general here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at visual politic.</v>

8
00:00:29.951 --> 00:00:33.190
<v Speaker 1>We are convinced and the analytical data</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to corroborate this,</v>

9
00:00:33.191 --> 00:00:36.430
<v Speaker 1>but we live in a world that is improving</v>
<v Speaker 1>and will be better in the future.</v>

10
00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:44.523
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that does not mean that that on no </v>

11
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean obviously there are some of these</v>

12
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.623
<v Speaker 1>are as serious as this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are facing the largest humanitarian </v>

13
00:00:52.991 --> 00:00:56.500
<v Speaker 1>crisis since the creation of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nations in 1945.</v>

14
00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:57.363
<v Speaker 1>Now more than 20 million people across </v>
<v Speaker 1>four countries face starvation and </v>

15
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.540
<v Speaker 1>famine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

16
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:02.403
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are still many problems on this </v>

17
00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.433
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.110
<v Speaker 1>within recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization has become,</v>

19
00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.003
<v Speaker 1>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culprit of everything and the </v>

20
00:01:11.321 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>scapegoat for all of our centers.</v>

21
00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.470
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment's relocation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>

22
00:01:18.471 --> 00:01:19.670
<v Speaker 1>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For many people,</v>

23
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>these are the consequences of a process </v>
<v Speaker 1>of global integration,</v>

24
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.730
<v Speaker 1>which more and more people think has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone too far.</v>

25
00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>The numbers are quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time a survey has done,</v>

26
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.940
<v Speaker 1>most people think that the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting worse and this is happening in a</v>

27
00:01:31.941 --> 00:01:35.930
<v Speaker 1>way because of globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want an example?</v>

28
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 study was published in the </v>

29
00:01:38.421 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>economist that found that less than half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Americans,</v>

30
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.330
<v Speaker 1>Brits and the French leaved that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole process was a good thing and as we</v>

31
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.740
<v Speaker 1>have seen here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic,</v>

32
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.633
<v Speaker 1>all this growing unpopularity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization has been exploited in </v>

33
00:01:52.851 --> 00:01:56.870
<v Speaker 1>practically every corner of the world by</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of politicians,</v>

34
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.213
<v Speaker 1>politicians who oppose immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You opposed free trade and oppose </v>

35
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.320
<v Speaker 1>ultimately well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that's difference.</v>

36
00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this occasion,</v>

37
00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.623
<v Speaker 1>it is not a matter of political color in</v>
<v Speaker 1>both rightwing parties and left wing </v>

38
00:02:10.811 --> 00:02:13.330
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We find this type of discourse.</v>

39
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.193
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps a good example was the elections</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States where we saw how </v>

40
00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:19.840
<v Speaker 1>both Donald Trump and the democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary candidates,</v>

41
00:02:19.841 --> 00:02:22.450
<v Speaker 1>Bernie Sanders defendants in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another,</v>

42
00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.313
<v Speaker 1>this sort of speech which can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>summarized in a sentence as </v>

43
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>globalization is destroying our society.</v>

44
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.893
<v Speaker 2>It used to be cars were made in flint </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you couldn't drink the water in </v>

45
00:02:37.851 --> 00:02:38.684
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now cars are made in Mexico and you </v>

46
00:02:43.851 --> 00:02:47.900
<v Speaker 2>can't drink the water in flint</v>

47
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.280
<v Speaker 3>since 2001,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have seen over 50,000</v>

48
00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:59.980
<v Speaker 3>factories in America shut down millions </v>
<v Speaker 3>of workers,</v>

49
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.963
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions of workers have lost decent </v>

50
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.290
<v Speaker 1>paying jobs,</v>

51
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:10.410
<v Speaker 4>but then America changed his policy from</v>
<v Speaker 4>promoting development in America and in,</v>

52
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.520
<v Speaker 4>in America to promoting development in </v>
<v Speaker 4>other nations</v>

53
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.120
<v Speaker 1>with political movements that in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years have spread like wildfire.</v>

54
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.983
<v Speaker 1>I arena has emerged a widespread </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception that says that globalization </v>

55
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:33.723
<v Speaker 1>is stopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I think the question we have to </v>

56
00:03:35.801 --> 00:03:36.634
<v Speaker 1>answer here is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is really happening with </v>

57
00:03:38.921 --> 00:03:41.920
<v Speaker 1>globalization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we facing a paradigm change?</v>

58
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's have a look.</v>

59
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:49.000
<v Speaker 4>The break</v>

60
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.443
<v Speaker 1>last seven decades since the Second </v>
<v Speaker 1>World War and globalization has </v>

61
00:03:55.391 --> 00:03:58.810
<v Speaker 1>accelerated constantly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with it the movement of people,</v>

62
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.030
<v Speaker 1>goods and capital all over the world.</v>

63
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.873
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

64
00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:05.173
<v Speaker 1>All these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many political barriers to trade have </v>

65
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:07.934
<v Speaker 1>been eliminated for a company to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>factories or sell products in a country </v>

66
00:04:11.031 --> 00:04:13.320
<v Speaker 1>produced thousands of kilometers away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.070
<v Speaker 1>it's become totally normal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly wherever you live,</v>

68
00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:16.904
<v Speaker 1>eating Sushi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pizza and Nachos with molly or even </v>

69
00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.730
<v Speaker 1>drinking a heineken has become the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal thing in the wells.</v>

70
00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.800
<v Speaker 1>Almost a tradition in itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a I didn't come.</v>

71
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>There might be a handicap,</v>

72
00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:31.020
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

73
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Or even those who predicted that </v>
<v Speaker 1>national borders would become a thing of</v>

74
00:04:37.191 --> 00:04:38.180
<v Speaker 1>the past.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

75
00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:42.020
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the culminating moments of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>this culture because in December of 2001</v>

76
00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.140
<v Speaker 1>when China joins the World Trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>Organization,</v>

77
00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.063
<v Speaker 1>that is when China really integrated </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the world economy and became </v>

78
00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:50.870
<v Speaker 1>something of a factory to the wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

79
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.763
<v Speaker 1>when the financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly things started to change </v>

80
00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:57.583
<v Speaker 1>according to data between 2011 and 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the value of the world's exports </v>

81
00:05:01.701 --> 00:05:05.060
<v Speaker 1>plummeted by 10 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is according to the WTO,</v>

82
00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.830
<v Speaker 1>and it's not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Mckinsey,</v>

83
00:05:06.831 --> 00:05:09.320
<v Speaker 1>the annual capital movements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is stocks,</v>

84
00:05:09.321 --> 00:05:10.154
<v Speaker 1>bonds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign investments or loans collapsed </v>

85
00:05:11.451 --> 00:05:12.284
<v Speaker 1>more than 60 percent between 2007 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>2015 addition the crisis and all those </v>

86
00:05:21.721 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 1>politicians you consider the trade is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>zero sum game web.</v>

87
00:05:24.721 --> 00:05:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Some wind and others always lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have results.</v>

88
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.343
<v Speaker 1>In recent years in protectionist </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations becoming fashionable once </v>

89
00:05:31.351 --> 00:05:31.810
<v Speaker 1>again.</v>

90
00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.810
<v Speaker 4>From this day forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a new vision will govern our land.</v>

91
00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:42.990
<v Speaker 4>From this day forward,</v>
<v Speaker 4>it's going to be only America first.</v>

92
00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.270
<v Speaker 4>America first</v>

93
00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:50.260
<v Speaker 2>business</v>

94
00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:51.093
<v Speaker 1>leaders are scrambling to adjust to </v>
<v Speaker 1>world few imagined possible just a year </v>

95
00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:55.503
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Myth of a borderless world has come </v>

96
00:05:56.471 --> 00:05:57.304
<v Speaker 1>crashing Pankaj Ghemawat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the global trade alert </v>

97
00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 1>panel that monitors how government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken measures that affects trades since</v>

98
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:06.650
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 8,000</v>

99
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:09.110
<v Speaker 1>protectionist regulations have been put </v>
<v Speaker 1>into play.</v>

100
00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:15.813
<v Speaker 1>Wait just a moment because although it </v>
<v Speaker 1>does seem true that in recent years </v>

101
00:06:18.741 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 1>international traders lost strength,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not entirely true,</v>

102
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:28.420
<v Speaker 1>not true for two main reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

103
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:31.270
<v Speaker 1>instead of seeing what has happened </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the crisis,</v>

104
00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.640
<v Speaker 1>let's take a slightly longer period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

105
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:35.560
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the year 2000.</v>

106
00:06:35.561 --> 00:06:38.530
<v Speaker 1>So if we look at what is happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 21st century,</v>

107
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:43.560
<v Speaker 1>it so happens that both trade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments have grown seconds.</v>

108
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.500
<v Speaker 1>While you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2017,</v>

109
00:06:47.501 --> 00:06:50.140
<v Speaker 1>globalization is returning with </v>
<v Speaker 1>strength,</v>

110
00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.460
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

111
00:06:51.461 --> 00:06:52.294
<v Speaker 1>there has been a revolution that not </v>
<v Speaker 1>even Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin has </v>

112
00:06:55.181 --> 00:06:56.014
<v Speaker 1>been able to put a stop to a revolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>that will make our world look a whole </v>

113
00:06:59.201 --> 00:07:04.201
<v Speaker 1>lot smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Digital globalization</v>

114
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:12.620
<v Speaker 1>trade has been around for a number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

115
00:07:12.621 --> 00:07:17.480
<v Speaker 1>but now international data traffic has </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploded in the United States alone.</v>

116
00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.590
<v Speaker 1>80 terabytes of data enter and leave the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country every minute.</v>

117
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.730
<v Speaker 1>A gigantic number that is eight times </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content of the library of Congress,</v>

118
00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the largest libraries in</v>

119
00:07:28.971 --> 00:07:32.240
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of that's happening every single</v>

120
00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:34.160
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emails,</v>

121
00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>skype calls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social networks.</v>

122
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.433
<v Speaker 1>According to Mckinsey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>international data flow is more </v>

123
00:07:38.301 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>important to the economy than the trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>of goods.</v>

124
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook has just exceeded the 2 billion</v>

125
00:07:44.091 --> 00:07:46.400
<v Speaker 1>active users,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mark off favorite platform.</v>

126
00:07:46.401 --> 00:07:50.000
<v Speaker 1>Youtube breaks its own historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>records every single year.</v>

127
00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:50.893
<v Speaker 1>They may seem too little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that the business they </v>

128
00:07:53.331 --> 00:07:57.140
<v Speaker 1>generate is absolutely huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take another example.</v>

129
00:07:57.230 --> 00:07:59.540
<v Speaker 1>Anytime to have 10 readers of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Financial Times,</v>

130
00:07:59.541 --> 00:08:00.374
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers in the world from countries </v>

131
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.560
<v Speaker 1>other than the UK to have Amazon or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba,</v>

132
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.973
<v Speaker 1>which are full of entrepreneurs from all</v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds who are all working to sell </v>

133
00:08:23.341 --> 00:08:24.840
<v Speaker 1>their products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition today,</v>

134
00:08:24.841 --> 00:08:25.674
<v Speaker 1>we can have designers or by video games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through online platforms and this </v>

135
00:08:28.351 --> 00:08:31.680
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's only just begun according to Oxford</v>

136
00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.513
<v Speaker 1>Economics and HSBC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>International Trade in services will </v>

137
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.770
<v Speaker 1>triple in the next 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just taking a look at this graphic.</v>

138
00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:42.950
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's</v>

139
00:08:45.630 --> 00:08:47.330
<v Speaker 1>a pretty interesting result.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't you think?</v>

140
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:49.890
<v Speaker 1>These laminates and my husband,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is one.</v>

141
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:54.900
<v Speaker 1>That's God.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I see my blood every night</v>

142
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.540
<v Speaker 5>because my brother.</v>

143
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that if we consider all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

144
00:09:16.291 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the global connection,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the degree of integration that exists in</v>

145
00:09:19.891 --> 00:09:20.724
<v Speaker 1>the world today is higher than in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just before the outbreak of the great </v>

146
00:09:24.930 --> 00:09:25.763
<v Speaker 1>global crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that each day that passes </v>

147
00:09:27.990 --> 00:09:30.210
<v Speaker 1>brings us into a much more connected </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

148
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.103
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry for those of you don't like </v>

149
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:33.060
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but globalization,</v>

150
00:09:33.061 --> 00:09:34.860
<v Speaker 1>it's not going to go away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

151
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.600
<v Speaker 1>It's only going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

152
00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:37.463
<v Speaker 1>we'd now like to pose the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that despite politicians </v>

153
00:09:40.051 --> 00:09:40.884
<v Speaker 1>like Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are at the door of a new boost for </v>

154
00:09:43.051 --> 00:09:48.051
<v Speaker 1>global integration nosotros in a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was those</v>

155
00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:59.120
<v Speaker 2>no new sunrise</v>

156
00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:09.113
<v Speaker 1>possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that if you asked us how we see the </v>

157
00:10:10.411 --> 00:10:11.244
<v Speaker 1>future of globalization and free trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would respond negatively as we've </v>

158
00:10:14.251 --> 00:10:17.220
<v Speaker 1>seen in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what most people seem to think.</v>

159
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:18.390
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprisingly,</v>

160
00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:20.300
<v Speaker 1>governance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't seem to share that</v>

161
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.193
<v Speaker 2>opinion.</v>

162
00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.880
<v Speaker 1>Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

163
00:10:25.910 --> 00:10:29.210
<v Speaker 1>the breaking down of terrorists and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions is again becoming fashion</v>

164
00:10:29.290 --> 00:10:30.123
<v Speaker 2>cool.</v>

165
00:10:31.990 --> 00:10:32.823
<v Speaker 1>Argentina and Chile side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most ambitious free trade agreement </v>

166
00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:35.944
<v Speaker 1>in 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wallscape took the lead in the creation </v>

167
00:10:38.081 --> 00:10:38.914
<v Speaker 1>of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which aims to improve the economic </v>

168
00:10:42.701 --> 00:10:43.534
<v Speaker 1>status of the countries that make up </v>
<v Speaker 1>these so called Russian area of </v>

169
00:10:46.571 --> 00:10:47.404
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

170
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:48.790
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

171
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:49.670
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ballerinas,</v>

172
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.490
<v Speaker 1>Armenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,</v>

173
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:53.370
<v Speaker 1>not all part of this alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

174
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.303
<v Speaker 1>the European Union itself has also </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched its most ambitious free trade </v>

175
00:10:57.341 --> 00:10:57.730
<v Speaker 1>program.</v>

176
00:10:57.730 --> 00:10:58.563
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

177
00:11:00.760 --> 00:11:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Given all this antiglobalization talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>might be surprised to hear that.</v>

178
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:04.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be because the European </v>

179
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:06.543
<v Speaker 1>Union has just signed a trade agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Canada and it's about to do the </v>

180
00:11:08.561 --> 00:11:09.394
<v Speaker 1>same with Singapore and Vietnam and it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>also made progress in negotiations with </v>

181
00:11:13.061 --> 00:11:13.894
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft as well as beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate with Australia and New </v>

182
00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Zealand's even China wants to strengthen</v>
<v Speaker 1>its commercial commitments.</v>

183
00:11:19.930 --> 00:11:20.763
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is demanding that the World Trade </v>

184
00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:24.220
<v Speaker 1>Organization recognize it as a market </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

185
00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:28.240
<v Speaker 1>You see when in 2001 trying to join the </v>
<v Speaker 1>WTO,</v>

186
00:11:28.270 --> 00:11:31.570
<v Speaker 1>it did so under its economic status,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not market status,</v>

187
00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.960
<v Speaker 1>and it was agreed that 15 years later </v>
<v Speaker 1>this condition would be reviewed.</v>

188
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:36.340
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

189
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:40.223
<v Speaker 1>All that time has come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a technicality that </v>

190
00:11:42.271 --> 00:11:46.560
<v Speaker 1>allows the rest of the WTO countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the United States or EU members,</v>

191
00:11:46.561 --> 00:11:49.620
<v Speaker 1>to impose protectionist measures in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their relations with</v>

192
00:11:49.950 --> 00:11:53.000
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

193
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 1>anti dumping measures</v>

194
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 2>or to restrict imports of cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturers in the Asian giants.</v>

195
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:58.473
<v Speaker 2>China achieves its purpose and is </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized as a full market economy and </v>

196
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:02.733
<v Speaker 2>that is something that will happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually we will see how it's </v>

197
00:12:04.841 --> 00:12:05.674
<v Speaker 2>commercial relations with the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world are going to have another </v>

198
00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:09.280
<v Speaker 2>important step 10</v>

199
00:12:12.680 --> 00:12:13.513
<v Speaker 1>street that people listened to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of protectionist politicians and </v>

200
00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:18.200
<v Speaker 1>critics of globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but events.</v>

201
00:12:18.230 --> 00:12:20.180
<v Speaker 1>They're going to take other paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

202
00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:21.043
<v Speaker 1>we think this is a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to globalization and the </v>

203
00:12:22.521 --> 00:12:24.650
<v Speaker 1>integration of peoples in the last 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

204
00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.513
<v Speaker 1>we have lived through the periods in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which poverty has been reduced the most </v>

205
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.620
<v Speaker 1>in the entire of human history.</v>

206
00:12:31.020 --> 00:12:36.020
<v Speaker 6>Nor do they view that they the one all </v>
<v Speaker 6>told me to ask</v>

207
00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:03.743
<v Speaker 1>more than a billion people have escaped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Extreme needs in the middle class has </v>

208
00:13:06.031 --> 00:13:06.864
<v Speaker 1>grown as never before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the average life expectancy has gone </v>

209
00:13:08.701 --> 00:13:09.534
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up as even global inequality has </v>

210
00:13:11.371 --> 00:13:12.960
<v Speaker 1>been reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So anyway,</v>

211
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:13.823
<v Speaker 1>what we hope is that the next 25 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>are going to be even better and that we </v>

212
00:13:16.531 --> 00:13:18.300
<v Speaker 1>recognize that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all political,</v>

213
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:21.960
<v Speaker 1>cultural and social differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we shouldn't see them as a threat.</v>

214
00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.190
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll end this video,</v>

215
00:13:23.191 --> 00:13:25.950
<v Speaker 1>but asking you what you think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing globalization,</v>
