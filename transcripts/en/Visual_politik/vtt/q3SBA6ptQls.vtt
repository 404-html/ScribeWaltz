WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.520
<v Speaker 1>It's the second most populated country </v>
<v Speaker 1>on earth.</v>

2
00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:05.650
<v Speaker 1>Seventh biggest economy.</v>

3
00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:06.783
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:12.690
<v Speaker 1>One of the 10 biggest military budgets </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world and is a nuclear power.</v>

5
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 1>India is a stranger in political terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If I were to ask you,</v>

6
00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.790
<v Speaker 1>who's the prime minister of India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could you tell me?</v>

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:26.903
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am aware that many of you will </v>

8
00:00:27.961 --> 00:00:30.780
<v Speaker 1>actually know this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're watching this video</v>

9
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:31.614
<v Speaker 1>from India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you don't know who the prime </v>

10
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>minister of India is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry because.</v>

11
00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.600
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that happens a lot</v>

12
00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.600
<v Speaker 1>on the 26th of May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2014 after an absolute majority,</v>

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.434
<v Speaker 1>which had not been seen in 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Narendra Modi became the prime minister </v>

14
00:00:52.681 --> 00:00:54.120
<v Speaker 1>of India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moody's mission,</v>

15
00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.000
<v Speaker 1>whether it was clear boost growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

16
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.970
<v Speaker 1>and to create millions of jobs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>conclusion,</v>

17
00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.350
<v Speaker 1>turn India into a superpower capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>competing with China on an economic,</v>

18
00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and military level.</v>

19
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Gene Kim,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how todd?</v>

20
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.700
<v Speaker 1>You know India because you're a politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>view is,</v>

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.553
<v Speaker 1>is something all on eternal promise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's always that country that seems to </v>

22
00:01:17.671 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>be the next one that's going to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>off,</v>

23
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:20.663
<v Speaker 1>but it never really does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where you can see that this is </v>

24
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:23.304
<v Speaker 1>definitely the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we take a look at India's GDP and </v>

25
00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.000
<v Speaker 1>compare it to that of China,</v>

26
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>they seem quite different economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>development in the last few decades,</v>

27
00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:39.090
<v Speaker 1>so with Moody's victory expectations </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

28
00:01:39.091 --> 00:01:40.080
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high end,</v>

29
00:01:40.081 --> 00:01:42.450
<v Speaker 1>India has again become the talk of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>town.</v>

30
00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.313
<v Speaker 1>Moody is repeating over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The 21st century is going to be India's </v>

31
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.770
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.630
<v Speaker 1>before we get into all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at boody himself.</v>

33
00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's Narendra Modi,</v>

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.370
<v Speaker 1>vegetarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>single ends,</v>

35
00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:58.204
<v Speaker 1>a yoga enthusiast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modi escapes the traditional politician </v>

36
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.854
<v Speaker 1>profile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He comes from a family of limited means </v>

37
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:04.434
<v Speaker 1>and when he was a child,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to help his father sell tea in a </v>

38
00:02:06.301 --> 00:02:07.134
<v Speaker 1>train station.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has helped him and the sympathy of </v>

39
00:02:08.881 --> 00:02:09.714
<v Speaker 1>many poor people in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They see him as an example of a rags to </v>

40
00:02:13.201 --> 00:02:17.490
<v Speaker 1>riches story and shows that rags to </v>
<v Speaker 1>riches in India can sometimes work.</v>

41
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:21.723
<v Speaker 1>His political ideology has always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>very attached to Hinduism and he is not </v>

42
00:02:25.301 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>always taken a moderate approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

43
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.100
<v Speaker 1>before getting involved with the BJP </v>
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>

44
00:02:30.101 --> 00:02:30.934
<v Speaker 1>he was involved with the rfs as potty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The RSS Party isn't extreme rights </v>

45
00:02:34.451 --> 00:02:35.284
<v Speaker 1>policy that had Mahatma Gandhi's </v>
<v Speaker 1>assassin as one of its members for 13 </v>

46
00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.750
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 2011 and 2014.</v>

47
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Moody was the regional Prime Minister in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state of good Gerard Gerard.</v>

48
00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.970
<v Speaker 1>It's 65 million inhabitants has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>numb to Moody's leadership,</v>

49
00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.270
<v Speaker 1>India's greatest economic driver with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>annual growth rate of 10 percent.</v>

50
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.853
<v Speaker 1>It's like these impressive figures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social Welfare has also greatly </v>

51
00:03:04.261 --> 00:03:05.094
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every home has access to the </v>

52
00:03:06.331 --> 00:03:07.530
<v Speaker 1>plumbing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>

53
00:03:07.531 --> 00:03:08.364
<v Speaker 1>and preschool education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the general election in India was </v>

54
00:03:10.681 --> 00:03:11.514
<v Speaker 1>taking place,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moody promised to replicate what he'd </v>

55
00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.720
<v Speaker 1>done in his state in the rest of India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

56
00:03:15.721 --> 00:03:20.610
<v Speaker 1>he promised to do this in just 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is only two political terms,</v>

57
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.120
<v Speaker 3>Lauren Nigga,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we did look by his dish arms,</v>

58
00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:26.083
<v Speaker 3>arms,</v>
<v Speaker 3>shit,</v>

59
00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.943
<v Speaker 3>abuse,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I've magical Niggas don't </v>

60
00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:30.790
<v Speaker 3>niggas.</v>

61
00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:32.860
<v Speaker 1>This is because for Moody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Year Twenty,</v>

62
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:34.930
<v Speaker 1>22 is a landmark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>It's the 75th anniversary of India's </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

64
00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.333
<v Speaker 1>The country will also support us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China as the world's most populous </v>

65
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.304
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reaching a population of one point 6 </v>

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:46.810
<v Speaker 1>billion people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moody says that by the year 20,</v>

67
00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:47.644
<v Speaker 1>22,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be clear that the 21st </v>

68
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>century is India</v>

69
00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.083
<v Speaker 2>century.</v>

70
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.113
<v Speaker 1>This is certainly not going to be easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in a country where the </v>

71
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>population is growing by 28 people every</v>
<v Speaker 1>minute.</v>

72
00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>measure problem.</v>

73
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.940
<v Speaker 1>Now India has many problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but three,</v>

74
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.700
<v Speaker 1>do you stand out as particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>important?</v>

75
00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.240
<v Speaker 1>The first is that India is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrat's paradise.</v>

76
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.103
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if bureaucracy was the key to </v>

77
00:04:25.401 --> 00:04:26.234
<v Speaker 1>prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India would probably be the most </v>

78
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:32.000
<v Speaker 1>prosperous country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately though bureaucracy instead</v>

79
00:04:32.001 --> 00:04:34.820
<v Speaker 1>of encouraging business actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevents it.</v>

80
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:35.773
<v Speaker 1>John Cody has blamed the Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy for putting roadblocks in </v>

81
00:04:39.231 --> 00:04:40.064
<v Speaker 1>the group of Indian economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the doing business report </v>

82
00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:43.694
<v Speaker 1>from the wells bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which estimates how easy it is to do </v>

83
00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:46.544
<v Speaker 1>business in India occupies the 130th </v>
<v Speaker 1>position each step of the way to </v>

84
00:04:51.141 --> 00:04:51.974
<v Speaker 1>establishing a business in India takes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>ton of documents and then the taxes are </v>

85
00:04:56.051 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 1>not only high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that anyone really pays them,</v>

86
00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:01.130
<v Speaker 1>but they are also a nightmare to sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>

87
00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:01.993
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on not only different taxes in each </v>

88
00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:04.784
<v Speaker 1>individual state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are sometimes different taxes </v>

89
00:05:06.741 --> 00:05:10.460
<v Speaker 1>for each individual product or different</v>
<v Speaker 1>models of the same product.</v>

90
00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:11.353
<v Speaker 1>This is something that commonly happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>with vehicles and it is a real nice </v>

91
00:05:14.511 --> 00:05:15.920
<v Speaker 1>math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone to work out</v>

92
00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 3>Katina with the hand or they buddy nick </v>
<v Speaker 3>lingered further.</v>

93
00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.233
<v Speaker 1>DSM among public workers has reached </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a critical state that some </v>

94
00:05:29.241 --> 00:05:30.074
<v Speaker 1>hospitals have been forced to closed </v>
<v Speaker 1>temporarily because of the lack of </v>

95
00:05:32.571 --> 00:05:33.404
<v Speaker 1>staff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second big problem is that </v>

96
00:05:34.611 --> 00:05:39.380
<v Speaker 1>regulations in the marketplace make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so complicated that the market is barely</v>

97
00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:42.230
<v Speaker 1>able to function on the borders between </v>
<v Speaker 1>different states.</v>

98
00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:45.020
<v Speaker 1>You'll find trucks that are just cuing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to cross the border.</v>

99
00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:45.913
<v Speaker 1>Not a few people say that it's actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>easier to import something from abroad </v>

100
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.750
<v Speaker 1>than it is to get something from another</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

101
00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.703
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the terrible state of the </v>

102
00:05:52.581 --> 00:05:53.414
<v Speaker 1>country's infrastructure as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estimated that half of the country's </v>

103
00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:05.260
<v Speaker 1>harvest goes to waste every year because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of these delays.</v>

104
00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.183
<v Speaker 1>And the third big problem is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption is a big issue in Indian </v>

105
00:06:09.191 --> 00:06:11.020
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a quick example of this,</v>

106
00:06:11.021 --> 00:06:11.854
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that 50 percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that the government gives for </v>

107
00:06:14.561 --> 00:06:18.250
<v Speaker 1>welfare either ends up in the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>corrupt politicians or middlemen.</v>

108
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:22.240
<v Speaker 1>And so this is the country for Moody,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is having to deal with</v>

109
00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.930
<v Speaker 2>government policies.</v>

110
00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Some have suggested it has not yet taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

111
00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:31.743
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is is that the government has </v>

112
00:06:33.011 --> 00:06:35.470
<v Speaker 1>achieved some notable advances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

113
00:06:35.471 --> 00:06:38.590
<v Speaker 1>we could highlight the following in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to reduce bureaucracy.</v>

114
00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:39.483
<v Speaker 1>The government has created a committee </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the purpose of determining which </v>

115
00:06:41.981 --> 00:06:45.160
<v Speaker 1>rules and regulations are obsolete and </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be eliminated.</v>

116
00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:48.640
<v Speaker 1>So far they've done away with more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>1700 of these rules.</v>

117
00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Moody has eliminated many restrictions </v>
<v Speaker 1>on foreign investments is past the first</v>

118
00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:53.823
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to set up a powerful planet to make </v>

119
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 1>India a destination for business</v>

120
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.920
<v Speaker 1>is also set forth an ambitious plan for </v>
<v Speaker 1>better financial inclusion.</v>

121
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.110
<v Speaker 1>This plan has a pretty unpronounceable </v>
<v Speaker 1>name,</v>

122
00:07:07.111 --> 00:07:09.180
<v Speaker 1>so I'm just going to show it on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>screen now.</v>

123
00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:10.163
<v Speaker 1>And this plan has basically allowed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to have a bank account for the </v>

124
00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:13.584
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people who've taken this </v>

125
00:07:14.761 --> 00:07:16.410
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's about $200 million.</v>

126
00:07:16.411 --> 00:07:17.244
<v Speaker 1>And this basically means that that </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare money that is coming from the </v>

127
00:07:19.201 --> 00:07:20.034
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have to go through any </v>

128
00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>middlemen further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government has also put forth a plan</v>

129
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:25.860
<v Speaker 1>to simplify a very complicated tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

130
00:07:25.861 --> 00:07:28.380
<v Speaker 1>Having a flat sales tax at the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>level.</v>

131
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:32.700
<v Speaker 2>There's also</v>

132
00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:33.533
<v Speaker 1>announced that they're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending a lot of money on </v>

133
00:07:34.651 --> 00:07:35.484
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure with a hundred and </v>
<v Speaker 1>$30,000,000,000 being spent on rail by </v>

134
00:07:39.151 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 1>2020.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So again this year,</v>

135
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:44.550
<v Speaker 1>our plan is to really connect a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these small towns and cities to the main</v>

136
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:45.384
<v Speaker 1>national highway and,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the target or the government is to </v>

137
00:07:46.951 --> 00:07:49.800
<v Speaker 1>construct 10,000 kilometers of road </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>

138
00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:50.723
<v Speaker 1>But these aside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moody's most risky moves so far happens </v>

139
00:07:53.641 --> 00:07:58.641
<v Speaker 1>in November of 2016 mbs cash crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to fight corruption,</v>

140
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:08.340
<v Speaker 1>India suddenly made the countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>501,000 rupee notes illegal.</v>

141
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:12.480
<v Speaker 1>These represented 85 percent of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>our cash in India.</v>

142
00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:15.120
<v Speaker 1>A country that is really a cash based </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

143
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.013
<v Speaker 1>the goal was to find dirty money and </v>
<v Speaker 1>punish it when the owners came into the </v>

144
00:08:18.961 --> 00:08:19.794
<v Speaker 1>bank to switch out that 500 and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>phenols and notes for ones in the new </v>

145
00:08:22.741 --> 00:08:23.640
<v Speaker 1>design.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

146
00:08:23.641 --> 00:08:26.580
<v Speaker 1>the plan was an utter disaster.</v>

147
00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:27.503
<v Speaker 1>The government didn't have enough cash </v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace the money that people wanted </v>

148
00:08:29.881 --> 00:08:31.080
<v Speaker 1>to exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

149
00:08:31.081 --> 00:08:31.914
<v Speaker 1>the country's atfs weren't working </v>
<v Speaker 1>properly because the new currency was a </v>

150
00:08:34.621 --> 00:08:37.890
<v Speaker 1>different shape to the old currency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ATM is hadn't been adjusted.</v>

151
00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.233
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People here have no money to buy my </v>

152
00:08:40.951 --> 00:08:43.770
<v Speaker 1>products so I can't buy stock from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market either.</v>

153
00:08:43.950 --> 00:08:44.783
<v Speaker 1>It's the end of my business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a botched operation that left </v>

154
00:08:47.041 --> 00:08:50.520
<v Speaker 1>the country moneyless and caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant damage to the economy.</v>

155
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.250
<v Speaker 1>Sales fell in November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By more than 30 percent.</v>

156
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.800
<v Speaker 1>Many businesses simply weren't able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay workers,</v>

157
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.140
<v Speaker 1>and many business transactions have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be canceled.</v>

158
00:08:58.170 --> 00:09:01.860
<v Speaker 1>Some studies estimate that the total </v>
<v Speaker 1>damage was two points of India's GDP.</v>

159
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:04.620
<v Speaker 1>This would mean for the bank note switch</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost India.</v>

160
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>$50,000,000,000 ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

161
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>the poorest in the country were the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hardest hit.</v>

162
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:10.583
<v Speaker 1>Then the government tried to save,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was all part of some big plans </v>

163
00:09:12.921 --> 00:09:15.540
<v Speaker 1>who encourage people to use more </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronic money,</v>

164
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:16.473
<v Speaker 1>a politician foreign policy agenda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is the field where the prime </v>

165
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:26.490
<v Speaker 1>minister has really excelled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In his first year alone,</v>

166
00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.980
<v Speaker 1>he visited my new team members</v>

167
00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:41.550
<v Speaker 1>that he's only been in power for a short</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of time,</v>

168
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:43.820
<v Speaker 1>that he has a treatment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some notable advances.</v>

169
00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:46.290
<v Speaker 1>The Pakistan treaty has improved India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

170
00:09:46.291 --> 00:09:48.410
<v Speaker 1>one relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a relationship with China,</v>

171
00:09:48.411 --> 00:09:51.350
<v Speaker 1>has started dealing with some economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and commercial issues.</v>

172
00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:52.393
<v Speaker 1>At a joint press conference,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Xi Jinping announced 20 </v>

173
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:00.080
<v Speaker 1>billion US dollars worth of investment </v>
<v Speaker 1>in India's infrastructure in five years.</v>

174
00:10:00.170 --> 00:10:01.460
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without any doubt,</v>

175
00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:02.323
<v Speaker 1>the greatest strength of Moody's </v>
<v Speaker 1>political agenda has been his approach </v>

176
00:10:05.391 --> 00:10:06.224
<v Speaker 1>to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chemistry between Obama and Moody </v>

177
00:10:08.541 --> 00:10:09.374
<v Speaker 1>has been quite significant and their </v>
<v Speaker 1>encounters have been frequent and </v>

178
00:10:11.870 --> 00:10:13.920
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have both even published an article</v>

179
00:10:13.921 --> 00:10:15.000
<v Speaker 1>altogether in the Washington.</v>

180
00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:21.880
<v Speaker 1>What we really need to ask now is we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>moody achieve his goals.</v>

181
00:10:21.910 --> 00:10:22.743
<v Speaker 1>That I'll certainly a great deal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges that he is going to have to </v>

182
00:10:25.181 --> 00:10:26.500
<v Speaker 1>overcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

183
00:10:26.501 --> 00:10:29.430
<v Speaker 1>it's been made clear to the prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister just how tricky it is,</v>

184
00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:33.790
<v Speaker 1>but the limits on bureaucracy further </v>
<v Speaker 1>moody has avoided many essential reforms</v>

185
00:10:33.791 --> 00:10:34.624
<v Speaker 1>such as ending India's labor regulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has mentioned that four out of </v>

186
00:10:37.511 --> 00:10:40.750
<v Speaker 1>every five jobs in the country are on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gray market.</v>

187
00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Moody claims to be an admirer of Lee </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kuan Yew.</v>

188
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.513
<v Speaker 1>Singapore's ex prime minister Modi </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to have the same drive or </v>

189
00:10:47.621 --> 00:10:49.990
<v Speaker 1>determination to transform India's </v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

190
00:10:50.020 --> 00:10:52.780
<v Speaker 1>So this is just our opinion here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>revisional politic,</v>

191
00:10:52.781 --> 00:10:55.480
<v Speaker 1>and we would love to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

192
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:58.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the 21st century is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be India Century?</v>

193
00:10:58.690 --> 00:10:59.523
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Modi is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve all that he has set out to </v>

194
00:11:02.201 --> 00:11:04.690
<v Speaker 1>achieve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do let us know in the comments below?</v>
