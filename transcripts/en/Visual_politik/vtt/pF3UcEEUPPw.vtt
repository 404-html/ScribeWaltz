1
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.290
<v Speaker 1>We already told you here on visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic,</v>

2
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:12.780
<v Speaker 1>even though it is unusual to hear about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

3
00:00:12.781 --> 00:00:13.614
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some things have begun to change in </v>

4
00:00:16.921 --> 00:00:21.921
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The year 2000,</v>

5
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.520
<v Speaker 1>half of the fastest growing economies on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet have actually been located on</v>

6
00:00:30.521 --> 00:00:31.354
<v Speaker 1>this continent according to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international monetary funds forecasts </v>

7
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>in 2018.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six.</v>

8
00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six of the 10 economies with the highest</v>

9
00:00:42.111 --> 00:00:45.110
<v Speaker 1>growth rates will be African countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Tanzania,</v>

10
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.200
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia in the Ivory Coast or at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>head of the race.</v>

11
00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:53.230
<v Speaker 1>In terms of global growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

12
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.670
<v Speaker 1>Africa is a huge continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's made up of 54 individual countries,</v>

13
00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>so we can find all sorts of situations </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

14
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.760
<v Speaker 1>Countries that grow a lot and countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that grow well less,</v>

15
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.653
<v Speaker 1>but there's a case that stands out above</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of them and not precisely because </v>

16
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.450
<v Speaker 1>things are going well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

17
00:01:14.451 --> 00:01:15.284
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about South Africa or a </v>

18
00:01:16.731 --> 00:01:17.564
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the great African hope for a </v>

19
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.200
<v Speaker 1>really long time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Dvu at the truth is that Nelson </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mandela's dream of a free and prosperous</v>

21
00:01:25.311 --> 00:01:27.350
<v Speaker 1>South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's become something of a nightmare.</v>

22
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.330
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have gone really wrong,</v>

23
00:01:29.331 --> 00:01:30.380
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

24
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>racial problems of returns in corruption</v>
<v Speaker 1>has spread throughout the country.</v>

25
00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>Congress is actually talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>expropriating,</v>

26
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:47.600
<v Speaker 1>the glands of white people without any </v>
<v Speaker 1>compensation.</v>

27
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.493
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in February the government changed and </v>

28
00:01:49.671 --> 00:01:52.670
<v Speaker 1>one of the richest men in Africa became </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new presidents.</v>

29
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.533
<v Speaker 1>So could South Africa get back on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right path or are we facing another </v>

30
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>great African disappointments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>

31
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:00.314
<v Speaker 1>we also want to look at what caused </v>
<v Speaker 1>those good years to ends and if the </v>

32
00:02:03.021 --> 00:02:05.300
<v Speaker 1>white population in the country faces </v>
<v Speaker 1>any risk,</v>

33
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.360
<v Speaker 1>so let's get on with it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South African disappointment.</v>

34
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.870
<v Speaker 1>South Africa is a huge country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's about the size of France,</v>

35
00:02:19.871 --> 00:02:20.800
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>

36
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:23.530
<v Speaker 1>the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Belgium all combined together and it</v>

37
00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:26.440
<v Speaker 1>represents about a quarter of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsaharan.</v>

38
00:02:26.441 --> 00:02:27.274
<v Speaker 1>Africa is GDP well after the ends of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pore size and after the democratic </v>

39
00:02:36.181 --> 00:02:37.014
<v Speaker 1>transition that began in 1994.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa experienced a particular </v>

40
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.330
<v Speaker 1>golden age between 1998 and 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy grew steadily.</v>

41
00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.164
<v Speaker 1>This allowed the black middle class to </v>
<v Speaker 1>double and essential services such as </v>

42
00:02:49.081 --> 00:02:50.670
<v Speaker 1>running water reached to most of the</v>

43
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.673
<v Speaker 2>relations</v>

44
00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.710
<v Speaker 1>with a big economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a vibrant democracy,</v>

45
00:02:56.711 --> 00:02:57.544
<v Speaker 1>a free press,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lots of civic organizations seems </v>

46
00:02:59.861 --> 00:03:04.180
<v Speaker 1>ready for South Africa to make the leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would allow its people and not just</v>

47
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.043
<v Speaker 1>white people to live the comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives of citizens of a developed </v>

48
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.920
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

49
00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:09.783
<v Speaker 1>South Africa was expected to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>role model for the entire African </v>

50
00:03:12.761 --> 00:03:13.594
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My hold on a moment here because things </v>

51
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.010
<v Speaker 1>don't always turn out quite as expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 2009,</v>

52
00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:24.130
<v Speaker 1>this entire process ended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

53
00:03:24.131 --> 00:03:29.131
<v Speaker 1>things have just gone from bad to worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economy isn't growing.</v>

54
00:03:33.631 --> 00:03:36.240
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment has risen to almost 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

55
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.103
<v Speaker 1>Poverty has picked up again and public </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts are absolutely shattered and </v>

56
00:03:40.501 --> 00:03:41.334
<v Speaker 1>that's not all the latest government </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures that the government is </v>

57
00:03:42.961 --> 00:03:45.720
<v Speaker 1>announced and the current social </v>
<v Speaker 1>tensions have even caused.</v>

58
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Announcements like this</v>

59
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:49.453
<v Speaker 3>last March,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2018 Australian Minister of internal </v>

60
00:03:51.951 --> 00:03:54.320
<v Speaker 3>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Peter Dutton publicly announced that his</v>

61
00:03:54.321 --> 00:03:58.460
<v Speaker 3>country would consider granting a </v>
<v Speaker 3>special emergency visa and refuge to the</v>

62
00:03:58.461 --> 00:04:02.150
<v Speaker 3>South African white population that felt</v>
<v Speaker 3>unsafe in their own country.</v>

63
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a moment here because we're</v>

64
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:05.424
<v Speaker 1>talking about an Australian minister </v>
<v Speaker 1>here talking about sheltering white </v>

65
00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.910
<v Speaker 1>South Africans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean all things really that bad.</v>

66
00:04:11.911 --> 00:04:14.700
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't this the country of harmony and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation?</v>

67
00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.680
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard what that minister had to say,</v>

68
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.780
<v Speaker 1>but at this point in the question really</v>
<v Speaker 1>still remains.</v>

69
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.550
<v Speaker 1>What the hell went wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:04:20.551 --> 00:04:23.730
<v Speaker 1>we already have our culprits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We talked about him before.</v>

71
00:04:23.731 --> 00:04:24.564
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a video that I will link to in the </v>

72
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:27.840
<v Speaker 1>description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who he is?</v>

73
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen.</v>

74
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Zuma,</v>

75
00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>ninth of May,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2009,</v>

76
00:04:40.741 --> 00:04:43.200
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Zuma became the president of South</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

77
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:46.740
<v Speaker 1>Just launched his controversial record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which included accusations of rape,</v>

78
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:48.840
<v Speaker 1>corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even organized crime.</v>

79
00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:49.743
<v Speaker 1>Zuma managed to reach power thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the support of the popular classes who </v>

80
00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.040
<v Speaker 1>felt that he was one of their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

81
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:56.874
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent leaders of the anti apartheid </v>

82
00:04:59.221 --> 00:05:03.000
<v Speaker 1>movement and leader for 10 years was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison with Nelson Mandela himself,</v>

83
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.280
<v Speaker 1>the father of the current South African </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation,</v>

84
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:09.540
<v Speaker 1>and this well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gave him a great deal of credibility.</v>

85
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:11.040
<v Speaker 1>Worldview.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jacob Zuma,</v>

86
00:05:11.041 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>who opened the practices polygamy and is</v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated to have at least 20 children,</v>

87
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.200
<v Speaker 1>was forced to resign and leave through </v>
<v Speaker 1>the back door on February the 14th,</v>

88
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:19.900
<v Speaker 1>2018.</v>

89
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:20.733
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

90
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:22.460
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

91
00:05:22.461 --> 00:05:23.294
<v Speaker 1>He was repudiated by his own party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the powerful African National Congress </v>

92
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:30.410
<v Speaker 1>cornered by the opposition who </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened him with a motion of censure.</v>

93
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:31.333
<v Speaker 1>He simply had no other alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had to leave one way or another for </v>

94
00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:36.680
<v Speaker 1>the almost nine years that Zuma was </v>
<v Speaker 1>empower.</v>

95
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.570
<v Speaker 1>Life in South Africa was a nightmare.</v>

96
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.560
<v Speaker 1>You see zoom that came to power with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>promise of a more prosperous country and</v>

97
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>more opportunities for the poorest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead it's.</v>

98
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think he did?</v>

99
00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.383
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing less than turning these South </v>

100
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.603
<v Speaker 1>African governments into a kind of mine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a business that's simply served him and </v>

101
00:05:54.031 --> 00:05:55.290
<v Speaker 1>is in a circle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

102
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:58.400
<v Speaker 1>do you know what the first thing he did </v>
<v Speaker 1>after named president was?</v>

103
00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he spent $23,000,000 from the state </v>

104
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:02.564
<v Speaker 1>budget to improve his private residence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what we mean pulled here or an </v>

105
00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:10.190
<v Speaker 1>empathy that he even had a cow barn and </v>
<v Speaker 1>a chicken coop built,</v>

106
00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.210
<v Speaker 1>but of course that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On March,</v>

107
00:06:15.211 --> 00:06:16.044
<v Speaker 1>the 16th national prosecutors announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they would present challenges </v>

108
00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:19.223
<v Speaker 1>against Jacob Zuma for a multimillion </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar purchase agreements of weapons </v>

109
00:06:21.751 --> 00:06:22.501
<v Speaker 1>ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>submarines,</v>

110
00:06:22.501 --> 00:06:23.334
<v Speaker 1>and fighter jets with European companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>that South Africa signs in the 19 </v>

111
00:06:25.981 --> 00:06:27.000
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For this time,</v>

112
00:06:27.001 --> 00:06:29.410
<v Speaker 1>Zuma was Nelson Mandela's deputy </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents.</v>

113
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:33.503
<v Speaker 1>This weapons purchase cost over </v>
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000,000 and the stated goal was </v>

114
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:40.740
<v Speaker 1>improving national security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real goal though was enriching.</v>

115
00:06:40.741 --> 00:06:41.574
<v Speaker 1>Guys like Jacob Zuma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arms deal was the most graphic loss </v>

116
00:06:46.141 --> 00:06:46.974
<v Speaker 1>of innocence of post apartheid South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa and it Persado the corruption </v>

117
00:06:49.891 --> 00:06:51.810
<v Speaker 1>we're seeing today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>David Lewis,</v>

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:52.733
<v Speaker 1>executive director of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch a nonprofit organization based in </v>

119
00:06:55.891 --> 00:06:58.590
<v Speaker 1>your hand is Berg,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one case.</v>

120
00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Dozens and dozens of more cases are </v>
<v Speaker 1>lined up for Zima,</v>

121
00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:04.170
<v Speaker 1>so in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

122
00:07:04.171 --> 00:07:06.420
<v Speaker 1>he was a really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really greedy dude.</v>

123
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:07.313
<v Speaker 1>In total is estimated that Jacob Zuma is</v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and the corruption of his </v>

124
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:10.404
<v Speaker 1>inner circle have cost the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>coffers more than 4 million American </v>

125
00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:16.980
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or if you think that is the West thing,</v>

126
00:07:16.981 --> 00:07:19.140
<v Speaker 1>well you all very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very wrong.</v>

127
00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.003
<v Speaker 1>The worst part is that he got the cancer</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is corruption to spread massively </v>

128
00:07:23.131 --> 00:07:24.480
<v Speaker 1>through the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen up here,</v>

129
00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.253
<v Speaker 1>cancer</v>

130
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>thing was always clear that Jacob Zuma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he even said it openly,</v>

131
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:41.360
<v Speaker 1>his party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national African Congress,</v>

132
00:07:41.361 --> 00:07:42.194
<v Speaker 1>was more important than the very South </v>
<v Speaker 1>African nation that had been elected to </v>

133
00:07:45.441 --> 00:07:49.460
<v Speaker 1>serve and what better way to put the </v>
<v Speaker 1>party in the forefront then by enriching</v>

134
00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:50.353
<v Speaker 1>it's leaders with public resources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what he did have since </v>

135
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Zuma came to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption has multiplied.</v>

136
00:07:58.100 --> 00:07:58.933
<v Speaker 1>State services are a mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and some math teachers don't even know </v>

137
00:08:01.191 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 1>what a square root is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

138
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:03.764
<v Speaker 1>the reason they got the job with simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they were formerly affiliated </v>

139
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:10.190
<v Speaker 1>with the president's party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually no institution in South Africa</v>

140
00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:11.053
<v Speaker 1>has been spared from the corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you see one way to measure the </v>

141
00:08:15.231 --> 00:08:16.064
<v Speaker 1>intensity of corruption in South Africa </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to look at the quality of housing </v>

142
00:08:18.741 --> 00:08:20.840
<v Speaker 1>that the government builds for its </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorest people.</v>

143
00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:23.900
<v Speaker 1>If the budget is already low,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we discount what politicians take,</v>

144
00:08:23.901 --> 00:08:26.810
<v Speaker 1>not only in terms of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also in construction materials,</v>

145
00:08:26.811 --> 00:08:29.600
<v Speaker 1>in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses end up so poorly constructed that</v>

146
00:08:29.601 --> 00:08:30.434
<v Speaker 1>some have even collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another very common form of corruption </v>

147
00:08:34.871 --> 00:08:38.110
<v Speaker 1>is seizing funds that were aimed at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments of the poorest areas.</v>

148
00:08:38.170 --> 00:08:39.003
<v Speaker 1>For an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can look at dairy farms that are </v>

149
00:08:40.241 --> 00:08:41.070
<v Speaker 1>backed by the government.</v>

150
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:43.010
<v Speaker 2>That's okay.</v>

151
00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 1>The best case is that of a farm promoted</v>
<v Speaker 1>directly by Moza benzies Wayne,</v>

152
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>who of course became zoom as minister of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mining.</v>

153
00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:50.863
<v Speaker 1>So I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day this gentleman came to a poor </v>

154
00:08:51.801 --> 00:08:52.634
<v Speaker 1>community and promise to build a dairy </v>
<v Speaker 1>farm that was financed by the </v>

155
00:08:54.771 --> 00:08:55.604
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Supposedly the farm would be controlled </v>

156
00:08:56.911 --> 00:08:57.744
<v Speaker 1>by the workers who'd joined the project </v>
<v Speaker 1>and who were even promised a trip to </v>

157
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:01.224
<v Speaker 1>India to learn how to manage the farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as you can probably see from this </v>

158
00:09:03.901 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>already,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly looking great.</v>

159
00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:08.373
<v Speaker 3>He said he wanted to change our lives.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said this thing was coming from the </v>

160
00:09:11.561 --> 00:09:14.170
<v Speaker 3>government free of charge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

161
00:09:14.171 --> 00:09:16.960
<v Speaker 3>we couldn't say don't like this thing.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He said,</v>

162
00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:21.250
<v Speaker 3>we must take it a frame can Yamini of </v>
<v Speaker 3>black South African farmer.</v>

163
00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:24.280
<v Speaker 1>In the end the government spends more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than $20,000,000,</v>

164
00:09:24.281 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 1>but the only ones who went on a trip </v>
<v Speaker 1>with,</v>

165
00:09:26.011 --> 00:09:26.844
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>members of this politicians church </v>

166
00:09:28.091 --> 00:09:30.580
<v Speaker 1>choir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course he kept any leftover money</v>

167
00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:31.493
<v Speaker 1>as for the farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What it is unclear if any cow milks </v>

168
00:09:33.970 --> 00:09:38.970
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this again is just one example.</v>

169
00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:42.153
<v Speaker 1>Out of hundreds in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars aimed at </v>

170
00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:49.270
<v Speaker 1>developments have been diverted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply lost by the leaders of the ruling</v>

171
00:09:49.271 --> 00:09:51.130
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

172
00:09:51.131 --> 00:09:53.410
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this has caused a huge amounts of</v>

173
00:09:53.411 --> 00:09:57.100
<v Speaker 1>economic damage investing in a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>where any politician can stick his hands</v>

174
00:09:57.101 --> 00:10:00.100
<v Speaker 1>in the coffers or where public accounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>are highly unreliable,</v>

175
00:10:00.130 --> 00:10:00.963
<v Speaker 1>does not sound enticing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now off Jacob Zoom is forced </v>

176
00:10:05.051 --> 00:10:05.884
<v Speaker 1>resignation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His party was getting nervous about the </v>

177
00:10:07.661 --> 00:10:10.540
<v Speaker 1>upcoming elections and the big question </v>
<v Speaker 1>now becomes,</v>

178
00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.000
<v Speaker 1>will the new government change things</v>

179
00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:20.093
<v Speaker 2>change</v>

180
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:24.450
<v Speaker 1>maybe the 15th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018.</v>

181
00:10:24.451 --> 00:10:26.970
<v Speaker 1>After Jacob Zoom his resignation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several roundup posts,</v>

182
00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:30.700
<v Speaker 1>another historic leader of the anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartheid movement was named president.</v>

183
00:10:30.730 --> 00:10:33.340
<v Speaker 1>We all talking about just any guy though</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Rammer poster,</v>

184
00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:34.223
<v Speaker 1>left politics at the end of the nineties</v>
<v Speaker 1>and leaped into the business wells as </v>

185
00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.231
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>

186
00:10:37.231 --> 00:10:38.064
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to his influence and his good </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations with governments around the </v>

187
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:43.440
<v Speaker 1>posts that became one of the wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>men in sub Saharan Africa.</v>

188
00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.333
<v Speaker 1>His car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately is estimated to be close </v>

189
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.210
<v Speaker 1>to half a billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:10:48.211 --> 00:10:49.044
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that this new president has </v>
<v Speaker 1>promised in new dawn and he has said </v>

191
00:10:51.361 --> 00:10:54.240
<v Speaker 1>that his policy will prioritize </v>
<v Speaker 1>balancing public accounts,</v>

192
00:10:54.241 --> 00:10:58.260
<v Speaker 1>attracting investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting corruption is mostly with South</v>

193
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is open for business.</v>

194
00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are already facing some problems.</v>

195
00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:05.760
<v Speaker 1>In March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Assembly approved the start</v>

196
00:11:05.761 --> 00:11:06.594
<v Speaker 1>of the process to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution in such a way that the </v>

197
00:11:08.341 --> 00:11:11.310
<v Speaker 1>governments can express,</v>
<v Speaker 1>create the lands of the white population</v>

198
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:14.430
<v Speaker 1>without any compensation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they do carry this out,</v>

199
00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>investments are certainly not going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come to the country.</v>

200
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:19.410
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to flee in the end.</v>

201
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:23.580
<v Speaker 1>Only time is going to tell if this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>government will succeed in getting South</v>

202
00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:24.413
<v Speaker 1>Africans and joined the lions that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>awakening for if the country will </v>

203
00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:29.970
<v Speaker 1>continue on its path towards the abyss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's your turn.</v>

204
00:11:29.971 --> 00:11:30.804
<v Speaker 1>Do you think your country's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>government is fighting enough against </v>

205
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Speaker 1>corruption?</v>
