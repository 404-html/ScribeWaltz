1
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Let us start two days video with having </v>
<v Speaker 1>a look at a question.</v>

2
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:12.953
<v Speaker 1>If you could choose between living like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest and most powerful person in </v>

3
00:00:15.571 --> 00:00:18.250
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>save three or 400 years ago and say,</v>

4
00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.093
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like George Washington or living today </v>

5
00:00:20.971 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>as a normal middle class person from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country like New Zealand,</v>

6
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.770
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Canada,</v>

7
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.870
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which one would you choose?</v>

8
00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:33.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of you watching right now might be </v>

9
00:00:34.101 --> 00:00:36.830
<v Speaker 1>tempted to choose all of that power and </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.640
<v Speaker 1>if you chose that option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my dear friends,</v>

12
00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:43.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think you have thought it </v>
<v Speaker 1>through quite enough.</v>

13
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:44.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain.</v>

14
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.493
<v Speaker 1>Choosing one of those historical super </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourteens would involve giving up basic </v>

15
00:00:48.411 --> 00:00:49.880
<v Speaker 1>things like AC,</v>
<v Speaker 1>internet,</v>

16
00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:50.810
<v Speaker 1>mobile phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>

17
00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:51.770
<v Speaker 1>pizza hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:00:51.771 --> 00:00:55.520
<v Speaker 1>a whole other number of things that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>indispensable in our lives today.</v>

19
00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:56.773
<v Speaker 1>Like pizza.</v>

20
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:00.743
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

21
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.280
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as of course,</v>

22
00:01:02.281 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>then there's the fact that you'd have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with a much,</v>

23
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.690
<v Speaker 1>much shorter life expectancy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

24
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.570
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the description </v>
<v Speaker 1>that economists,</v>

25
00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.210
<v Speaker 1>Xavier Salah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>El Martin made of Mansa Musa,</v>

26
00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.044
<v Speaker 1>the first of Molly's life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who at current prices would be </v>

27
00:01:15.061 --> 00:01:18.510
<v Speaker 1>considered the richest person of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

28
00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.680
<v Speaker 1>It took several months for a Mansa Musa </v>
<v Speaker 1>to travel the 5,000</v>

29
00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>kilometers that separate molly from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mecca on horseback,</v>

30
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 1>a trip that my modern plane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I take about six and a half hours.</v>

31
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.860
<v Speaker 1>His palaces had no air conditioning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no access to Google and his children can</v>

32
00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 1>play with a playstation or we </v>
<v Speaker 1>communicate with his colleague,</v>

33
00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.980
<v Speaker 1>the Sultan on a series of Cairo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mansa,</v>

34
00:01:40.981 --> 00:01:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Musa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know whatsapp,</v>

35
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.000
<v Speaker 1>facebook or mobile phone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

36
00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.043
<v Speaker 1>he was never able to cure a headache </v>
<v Speaker 1>with an aspirin and I don't think that </v>

37
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:52.380
<v Speaker 1>100 years ago things were really much </v>
<v Speaker 1>better and that's fine.</v>

38
00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.273
<v Speaker 1>John Rockefeller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the well known oil magnates couldn't </v>

39
00:01:55.081 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>even watch television and listen to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radio or use antibiotic.</v>

40
00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.300
<v Speaker 1>These luxury is simply did not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

41
00:02:04.301 --> 00:02:07.540
<v Speaker 1>that is absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it is me making this decision on,</v>

42
00:02:07.541 --> 00:02:08.374
<v Speaker 1>you know what I would choose,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I would absolutely choose a current </v>

43
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.610
<v Speaker 1>middle class life.</v>

44
00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Indeed</v>

45
00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.893
<v Speaker 1>I would avoid going back to the past as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as I possibly could because saying </v>

46
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:27.080
<v Speaker 1>things were better back then simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't.</v>

47
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.640
<v Speaker 2>Of course</v>

48
00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.490
<v Speaker 1>all of this shouldn't really surprise </v>
<v Speaker 1>you either.</v>

49
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.860
<v Speaker 1>After all innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technological development,</v>

50
00:02:33.861 --> 00:02:37.400
<v Speaker 1>they've always been the main drivers for</v>
<v Speaker 1>improving people's quality of life</v>

51
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 2>picture and sound coming together.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just like that.</v>

52
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.500
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

53
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:45.333
<v Speaker 1>regarding this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do have some good news for you and </v>

54
00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.990
<v Speaker 1>also unfortunately I've got some bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>news.</v>

55
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.883
<v Speaker 1>The good news is the all evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggests we are on the threshold of a </v>

56
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:54.784
<v Speaker 1>new era of revolutionary changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes that only seems possible in </v>

57
00:02:58.541 --> 00:02:59.510
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>novels,</v>

58
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.280
<v Speaker 1>previous</v>

59
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.113
<v Speaker 3>slate</v>

60
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and trucks that drive themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Biotechnology,</v>

61
00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.600
<v Speaker 1>robotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nano technology,</v>

62
00:03:06.601 --> 00:03:07.434
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence for simply the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to share knowledge on a massive </v>

63
00:03:10.641 --> 00:03:14.900
<v Speaker 1>scale through the clouds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are just a few of the huge changes</v>

64
00:03:14.901 --> 00:03:15.734
<v Speaker 1>that are absolutely going to be coming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bad news is that several experts </v>

65
00:03:19.641 --> 00:03:24.110
<v Speaker 1>state that both the speed and depth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these changes have been slowing down for</v>

66
00:03:24.111 --> 00:03:25.240
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means,</v>

67
00:03:25.241 --> 00:03:26.074
<v Speaker 1>but all of these technological miracles </v>
<v Speaker 1>could take a long time to arrive or </v>

68
00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.030
<v Speaker 1>actually might never even arrive at all.</v>

69
00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>The big rake.</v>

70
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.360
<v Speaker 1>The last 20 years of the 19th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the first 50 of the 20th century for</v>

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.680
<v Speaker 1>something like a golden age of </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

72
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:47.543
<v Speaker 1>The changes that occurred in those few </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades was so great that even today </v>

73
00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.640
<v Speaker 1>they seem like magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

74
00:03:53.641 --> 00:03:56.580
<v Speaker 1>many technologies were developed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>those times such as the automobile,</v>

75
00:03:56.581 --> 00:03:57.600
<v Speaker 1>airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>antibiotics,</v>

76
00:03:57.601 --> 00:03:58.860
<v Speaker 1>electricity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear energy,</v>

77
00:03:58.861 --> 00:04:00.570
<v Speaker 1>insecticides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many,</v>

78
00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.463
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more things that really did change </v>

79
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:04.914
<v Speaker 1>people's lives forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all of these changes in a little </v>

80
00:04:07.891 --> 00:04:08.724
<v Speaker 1>more than 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity has stopped riding on horses </v>

81
00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.250
<v Speaker 1>and found themselves able to travel to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the moon.</v>

82
00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.143
<v Speaker 1>Things into perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the airplanes </v>

83
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.040
<v Speaker 1>evolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This went from being something like this</v>

84
00:04:32.041 --> 00:04:32.874
<v Speaker 1>at the beginning of the 20th century to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this in the 50 </v>

85
00:04:35.911 --> 00:04:36.744
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

86
00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:39.943
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

87
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.533
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at how cars changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how they were at first and then </v>

88
00:04:46.141 --> 00:04:49.070
<v Speaker 1>this is how they were in the 1950s no </v>
<v Speaker 1>mama.</v>

89
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.863
<v Speaker 2>Oh good.</v>

90
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you guys are gene?</v>

91
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:00.370
<v Speaker 2>We could</v>

92
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.203
<v Speaker 1>even mentioned the microwave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's technology that in a short time </v>

93
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:04.324
<v Speaker 1>went from being a theory to being used </v>
<v Speaker 1>in large rate panels and in virtually </v>

94
00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.950
<v Speaker 1>every</v>

95
00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:09.783
<v Speaker 2>kitchen.</v>

96
00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:13.653
<v Speaker 1>The electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went from candles to light bulbs and </v>

97
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:16.874
<v Speaker 1>in a short amount of time communications</v>
<v Speaker 1>went from carrier pigeons to the First </v>

98
00:05:19.551 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 1>Telegraph and the telephone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It came soon after that.</v>

99
00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.203
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about eight spectacular </v>

100
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:29.180
<v Speaker 1>rates of technological developments </v>
<v Speaker 1>since then.</v>

101
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say that things they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>improved but not really so much</v>

102
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 2>playing planes.</v>

103
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.273
<v Speaker 1>They are basically still the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they are safer and they are more </v>

104
00:05:41.591 --> 00:05:44.950
<v Speaker 1>comfortable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's still the same technology.</v>

105
00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.873
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that the only field where </v>

106
00:05:47.081 --> 00:05:51.220
<v Speaker 1>several disruptive innovations have </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred has been in the digital world.</v>

107
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:53.063
<v Speaker 1>So now for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only question we really need to </v>

108
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:56.020
<v Speaker 1>answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

109
00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.883
<v Speaker 1>what actually happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are things going full steam in the </v>

110
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:02.630
<v Speaker 1>digital wells and not so much in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other fields?</v>

111
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some people like Peter Teal have a clear</v>

112
00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>idea why I'm check this out.</v>

113
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.090
<v Speaker 4>We've had a lot of innovation in </v>
<v Speaker 4>computers,</v>

114
00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.190
<v Speaker 4>information technology,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet,</v>

115
00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:14.440
<v Speaker 4>mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Internet in the world of bits,</v>

116
00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:17.950
<v Speaker 4>not so much in the world of Adam's </v>
<v Speaker 4>supersonic travel space,</v>

117
00:06:17.951 --> 00:06:19.750
<v Speaker 4>travel,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new forms of energy,</v>

118
00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:22.390
<v Speaker 4>new forms of medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new medical devices,</v>

119
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:23.523
<v Speaker 4>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I would say that we lived in a world in </v>

120
00:06:25.601 --> 00:06:29.320
<v Speaker 4>which bits were unregulated and Adams </v>
<v Speaker 4>were regulated.</v>

121
00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:30.363
<v Speaker 4>Peter Teal.</v>

122
00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sir,</v>

123
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.451
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute.</v>

124
00:06:31.451 --> 00:06:36.070
<v Speaker 1>Is Pizza deal saying that some bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations are holding innovation back?</v>

125
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know he's not actually the only one </v>

126
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:39.814
<v Speaker 1>who's saying this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many experts argue the innovation has </v>

127
00:06:44.321 --> 00:06:48.400
<v Speaker 1>been facing what can be called an almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>a perfect storm for years.</v>

128
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:50.830
<v Speaker 1>This is a storm composed of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

129
00:06:50.831 --> 00:06:54.040
<v Speaker 1>excessive regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>patterns and way too much</v>

130
00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.963
<v Speaker 2>predict</v>

131
00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.340
<v Speaker 1>post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about holding innovation,</v>

132
00:06:59.341 --> 00:07:00.174
<v Speaker 1>we need to know we are talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing all ask the whole thing </v>

133
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.833
<v Speaker 1>progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are slowing down technologies that </v>

134
00:07:05.971 --> 00:07:06.804
<v Speaker 1>could greatly improve our lives from </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking planes in space to the cure for </v>

135
00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:10.420
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

136
00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:15.420
<v Speaker 2>cancer paralyzed by fear.</v>

137
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it is true.</v>

138
00:07:23.211 --> 00:07:27.320
<v Speaker 1>Regulations do aim to improve safety and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of life for citizens,</v>

139
00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:30.050
<v Speaker 1>but intentions are one thing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

140
00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:30.913
<v Speaker 1>That's something completely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians often forget that </v>

141
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:33.674
<v Speaker 1>regulations also have negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences and of course if there are </v>

142
00:07:36.441 --> 00:07:39.440
<v Speaker 1>a lot of regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences can be quite negative.</v>

143
00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

144
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:44.420
<v Speaker 1>what is happening in the pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>research industry in the European Union,</v>

145
00:07:44.421 --> 00:07:47.720
<v Speaker 1>which is of course a world leader in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Samsung regulations.</v>

146
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.450
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how important medical and pharmaceutical</v>

147
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:56.720
<v Speaker 1>research is and how it can improve our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

148
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.583
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these huge regulations because the </v>

149
00:07:59.121 --> 00:07:59.954
<v Speaker 1>development of new medicines to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 10 years and we're not only </v>

150
00:08:03.261 --> 00:08:04.910
<v Speaker 1>talking about the time it takes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>laboratories,</v>

151
00:08:04.911 --> 00:08:05.744
<v Speaker 1>do comply with all the regulations here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even after they finally obtained </v>

152
00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.000
<v Speaker 1>authorization from the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>medicines agency,</v>

153
00:08:11.001 --> 00:08:11.834
<v Speaker 1>if they still have to wait one more year</v>
<v Speaker 1>to launch their product into the market </v>

154
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 1>simply because of bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

155
00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:22.620
<v Speaker 1>this all has pretty major consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>for one,</v>

156
00:08:22.650 --> 00:08:25.650
<v Speaker 1>they on greatly to lengthy innovative </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

157
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:29.460
<v Speaker 1>which is extensively based on past </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience for another.</v>

158
00:08:29.520 --> 00:08:30.353
<v Speaker 1>They make research incredibly expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about 10 or 12 years </v>

159
00:08:33.361 --> 00:08:36.970
<v Speaker 1>investing a lot of money without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance of earning anything right</v>

160
00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

161
00:08:43.341 --> 00:08:46.700
<v Speaker 1>prudence and ensuring safety is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely important,</v>

162
00:08:46.701 --> 00:08:49.370
<v Speaker 1>but 10 to 12 years because of excessive </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy.</v>

163
00:08:49.371 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that playing it a bit too </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe here.</v>

164
00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:53.340
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And there's</v>

165
00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>another detail that we absolutely cannot</v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

166
00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.473
<v Speaker 1>The monopolization that in some way all </v>
<v Speaker 1>these regulations create for big </v>

167
00:08:59.970 --> 00:09:01.800
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical multinationals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

168
00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:02.730
<v Speaker 1>you heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

169
00:09:02.730 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 1>Those who benefit the most from this </v>
<v Speaker 1>hyper regulation are precisely the large</v>

170
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies themselves.</v>

171
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:13.980
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

172
00:09:13.980 --> 00:09:14.813
<v Speaker 1>if small authorities can't cope with all</v>
<v Speaker 1>these costs in the market is changing </v>

173
00:09:17.851 --> 00:09:21.090
<v Speaker 1>less because there's less innovation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the large companies have a secure,</v>

174
00:09:21.210 --> 00:09:22.450
<v Speaker 1>large and stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

175
00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:28.120
<v Speaker 1>and the pharmaceutical industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just one example.</v>

176
00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Let me reiterate here because I don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be mistaken.</v>

177
00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:32.104
<v Speaker 1>Regulations are absolutely important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we need to be very careful about </v>

178
00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.320
<v Speaker 1>piper regulation because when we pile on</v>
<v Speaker 1>too many demands,</v>

179
00:09:38.321 --> 00:09:39.154
<v Speaker 1>we increased prices and we hope the </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress that improves people's lives </v>

180
00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:43.630
<v Speaker 1>the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is of course</v>

181
00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:45.120
<v Speaker 6>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Who gets it?</v>

182
00:09:45.121 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 6>Who gets to write the regular </v>
<v Speaker 6>regulations?</v>

183
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:48.600
<v Speaker 6>The bureaucrats,</v>
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>

184
00:09:48.601 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 6>The regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but who writes the laws?</v>

185
00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:51.533
<v Speaker 6>The lobbyists have controls,</v>
<v Speaker 6>so it's a lobbyists from the drug </v>

186
00:09:53.761 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 6>industry has control of writing.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The regulations.</v>

187
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:05.730
<v Speaker 1>Example of the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of this is mobile technology.</v>

188
00:10:05.830 --> 00:10:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that this technology was </v>
<v Speaker 1>first developed in the 1940s yeah,</v>

189
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mobile communication,</v>

190
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:12.443
<v Speaker 1>it's really not as new as it seems and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 1940s the mts mobile telephone </v>

191
00:10:16.501 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>service began to be developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a standard.</v>

192
00:10:18.451 --> 00:10:21.090
<v Speaker 1>They use radio waves to connect to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>landline with a mobile phone,</v>

193
00:10:21.150 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 1>but of course now you may be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

194
00:10:22.741 --> 00:10:25.770
<v Speaker 1>why the hell did it take so long for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this technology to mature?</v>

195
00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.641
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

196
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:27.474
<v Speaker 1>the first modern mobile phones didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>appear until the late eighties I didn't </v>

197
00:10:30.241 --> 00:10:32.790
<v Speaker 1>become popular until the late nineties </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

198
00:10:32.791 --> 00:10:37.050
<v Speaker 1>the answer to view at comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>political class and regulations.</v>

199
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:41.900
<v Speaker 6>If we are to ignore the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 6>regulations,</v>

200
00:10:41.901 --> 00:10:46.790
<v Speaker 6>if we are to ignore the relationship </v>
<v Speaker 6>between regulations and job loss,</v>

201
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:47.833
<v Speaker 6>there is basically no limit to the </v>
<v Speaker 6>fervor and ferocity that will be </v>

202
00:10:51.261 --> 00:10:55.910
<v Speaker 6>unleashed by bureaucrats who's perpetual</v>
<v Speaker 6>mandate is to regulate.</v>

203
00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:56.560
<v Speaker 6>See</v>

204
00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.393
<v Speaker 1>the US federal communications commission</v>
<v Speaker 1>and managers by law and grants licenses </v>

205
00:11:01.211 --> 00:11:02.044
<v Speaker 1>to the so-called radio spectrum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how electromagnetic radio </v>

206
00:11:05.711 --> 00:11:06.544
<v Speaker 1>frequencies are transmitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the signals that allow for </v>

207
00:11:09.551 --> 00:11:13.710
<v Speaker 1>telecommunication.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

208
00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:17.460
<v Speaker 1>when companies were investing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing mobile technology back in the</v>

209
00:11:17.461 --> 00:11:19.980
<v Speaker 1>1950s the federal communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>commission,</v>

210
00:11:19.981 --> 00:11:20.814
<v Speaker 1>which is after all a political body,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided that all mobile phones </v>

211
00:11:24.021 --> 00:11:27.480
<v Speaker 1>technology wasn't very important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the radio spectrum,</v>

212
00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:31.440
<v Speaker 1>how to be used to boost another nascent </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology television.</v>

213
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:34.410
<v Speaker 1>The idea here that television was indeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more useful.</v>

214
00:11:36.540 --> 00:11:37.920
<v Speaker 6>Totally.</v>
<v Speaker 6>I'm fantastical.</v>

215
00:11:37.921 --> 00:11:39.930
<v Speaker 6>I'd met all know all the PV industry.</v>

216
00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:40.943
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that today we can </v>

217
00:11:42.061 --> 00:11:44.310
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is that a large part of the</v>

218
00:11:44.311 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>spectrum was assigned to television so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more than was actually needed.</v>

219
00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 1>That means that those technologies could</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been developed at the same time,</v>

220
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>but the regulator simply did not see a </v>
<v Speaker 1>future in mobile communications.</v>

221
00:11:57.400 --> 00:11:59.390
<v Speaker 1>That's not it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In in 1973 in motor read,</v>

222
00:11:59.391 --> 00:12:00.224
<v Speaker 1>the Vice President Marty Cooper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who is considered the father of mobile </v>

223
00:12:02.291 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>phones to make the first call with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these devices that we all use today.</v>

224
00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:07.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you did not miss any of that date.</v>

225
00:12:07.451 --> 00:12:08.284
<v Speaker 1>The first mobile phone call actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened way back in the 1970s but once </v>

226
00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:12.783
<v Speaker 1>a game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regulator intervened and decided </v>

227
00:12:14.711 --> 00:12:19.360
<v Speaker 1>that competition wasn't possible in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile telephones and assigns the entire</v>

228
00:12:19.361 --> 00:12:20.830
<v Speaker 1>monopoly to a t.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And.</v>

229
00:12:20.831 --> 00:12:21.664
<v Speaker 1>T.</v>

230
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.010
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

231
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.843
<v Speaker 1>I think we can say that politicians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulators didn't hit the market tool </v>

232
00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:29.683
<v Speaker 1>and ended up delaying the development of</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile communications by more than 40 </v>

233
00:12:33.671 --> 00:12:34.810
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

234
00:12:34.811 --> 00:12:37.180
<v Speaker 1>so that was the case in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

235
00:12:37.181 --> 00:12:39.530
<v Speaker 1>but in Europe things they were also </v>
<v Speaker 1>going down a similar</v>

236
00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:43.840
<v Speaker 2>entity</v>

237
00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:44.850
<v Speaker 1>for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it,</v>

238
00:12:44.851 --> 00:12:45.684
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite normal because </v>
<v Speaker 1>research and innovation are for </v>

239
00:12:47.911 --> 00:12:51.270
<v Speaker 1>scientists and entrepreneurs and not for</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

240
00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:52.790
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the problem.</v>

241
00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:53.673
<v Speaker 1>Many public r and D programs face who </v>
<v Speaker 1>cannot work because their work is </v>

242
00:12:57.301 --> 00:13:00.920
<v Speaker 1>determined by politicians and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrats are visual politic.</v>

243
00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:01.763
<v Speaker 1>We've already discussed how governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>can play a prominent role in research </v>

244
00:13:03.841 --> 00:13:04.674
<v Speaker 1>development and investing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but need to do so while being aware of </v>

245
00:13:07.981 --> 00:13:08.814
<v Speaker 1>their limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is actually what has happened in </v>

246
00:13:14.901 --> 00:13:16.760
<v Speaker 1>Israel as we saw with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he yells in my program,</v>

247
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:17.623
<v Speaker 1>which gave leadership to investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs and scientists who worked </v>

248
00:13:21.201 --> 00:13:23.330
<v Speaker 1>in a competitive market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this isn't done,</v>

249
00:13:23.331 --> 00:13:26.300
<v Speaker 1>programs and public aid can actually be </v>
<v Speaker 1>really counterproductive.</v>

250
00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.223
<v Speaker 1>They can raise the costs of r and D and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I hinder startups progress and </v>

251
00:13:29.720 --> 00:13:32.330
<v Speaker 1>ultimately holtz technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments and innovations,</v>

252
00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:34.610
<v Speaker 1>which are the best ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we've mentioned,</v>

253
00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:36.380
<v Speaker 1>to improve everyone's quality of life.</v>

254
00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:39.291
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
