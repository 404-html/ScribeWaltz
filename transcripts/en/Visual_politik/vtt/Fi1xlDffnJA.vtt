<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:08.853
<v Speaker 2>it's throwing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You might be a country that you've only </v>

3
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:12.190
<v Speaker 2>heard about on the Eurovision song </v>
<v Speaker 2>contest.</v>

4
00:00:12.191 --> 00:00:13.024
<v Speaker 2>If you watch the Eurovision song contest</v>
<v Speaker 2>where the reality is that Estonia is a </v>

5
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:17.764
<v Speaker 2>pioneer in country in many fields,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some might even call it the Silicon </v>

6
00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.253
<v Speaker 2>Valley of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies like skype and transfer wise </v>

7
00:00:24.641 --> 00:00:25.474
<v Speaker 2>were created in Estonia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is particularly surprising given </v>

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 2>the just 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia was a part of the Soviet Union.</v>

9
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.153
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the geographically Astonia situation is </v>

10
00:00:34.991 --> 00:00:35.824
<v Speaker 2>far from being ideal there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Weather is pretty terrible and in the </v>

11
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 2>winter they have as little less three </v>
<v Speaker 2>hours of daylight every day.</v>

12
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.123
<v Speaker 2>They also have an ongoing demographic </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis that they are really struggling </v>

13
00:00:48.581 --> 00:00:50.860
<v Speaker 2>to solve further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike most countries,</v>

14
00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:51.694
<v Speaker 2>the female population of this stonier is</v>
<v Speaker 2>markedly higher than the male </v>

15
00:00:54.401 --> 00:00:57.250
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that people find it harder to</v>

16
00:00:57.251 --> 00:01:01.810
<v Speaker 2>find a partner and have children.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why every year Estonia maintains</v>

17
00:01:01.811 --> 00:01:05.470
<v Speaker 2>the course of population reduction and </v>
<v Speaker 2>yet despite all of this,</v>

18
00:01:05.471 --> 00:01:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Estonia is the most technologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced nation in all of Europe.</v>

19
00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.653
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is the only country in Europe where </v>

20
00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 2>access to the Internet is recognized in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the constitution,</v>

21
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:16.143
<v Speaker 2>but what really makes us stoney or get </v>
<v Speaker 2>into our countries all of fame is it's </v>

22
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.090
<v Speaker 2>your residence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that a person,</v>

23
00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:25.514
<v Speaker 2>no matter where they are from can simply</v>
<v Speaker 2>fill out a form and is become a virtual </v>

24
00:01:28.431 --> 00:01:29.264
<v Speaker 2>citizen of Estonia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the question you might have in your </v>

25
00:01:31.341 --> 00:01:34.670
<v Speaker 2>mind right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what does that really mean today?</v>

26
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 2>We are going to explain this to you in </v>
<v Speaker 2>this video,</v>

27
00:01:37.041 --> 00:01:39.800
<v Speaker 2>but first let's have a quick look at the</v>
<v Speaker 2>history of stds.</v>

28
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.413
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.153
<v Speaker 2>It's big themes of Vladimir Poutine in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1991 is stonier got its independence </v>

30
00:01:47.421 --> 00:01:49.040
<v Speaker 2>from the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

31
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:51.200
<v Speaker 2>Other countries like Belarus and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine,</v>

32
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:52.034
<v Speaker 2>God,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their independence at around the same </v>

33
00:01:52.891 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 2>time</v>

34
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.933
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

35
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.550
<v Speaker 2>those countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new political establishment that had</v>

36
00:01:58.551 --> 00:02:03.440
<v Speaker 2>a lot of influence from the old </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist elite Estonia was different.</v>

37
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.513
<v Speaker 2>Their first democratic Prime Minister </v>
<v Speaker 2>Martin Law Form Day cabinets with an </v>

38
00:02:07.611 --> 00:02:12.410
<v Speaker 2>average age of just 30 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were young people with new ideas.</v>

39
00:02:12.411 --> 00:02:17.030
<v Speaker 2>You had no dance to the old Soviet guard</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is how it's stonier opens their</v>

40
00:02:17.031 --> 00:02:17.864
<v Speaker 2>markets to the international economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They adopted a capitalist system and a </v>

41
00:02:21.301 --> 00:02:22.134
<v Speaker 2>fairly unique political system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>would become well known for its </v>

42
00:02:25.401 --> 00:02:26.750
<v Speaker 2>minimalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

43
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:27.584
<v Speaker 2>it is this word minimalism that really </v>
<v Speaker 2>describes a stony are better than any </v>

44
00:02:30.561 --> 00:02:31.394
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if their flag as minimalist and is </v>

45
00:02:33.081 --> 00:02:35.590
<v Speaker 2>simply a representation of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional lands.</v>

46
00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:39.930
<v Speaker 1>Even their taxation</v>

47
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.600
<v Speaker 2>is minimalist and they have a flat rate </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax system.</v>

48
00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 2>This means that everyone in the country </v>
<v Speaker 2>pays the same percentage of tax,</v>

49
00:02:46.681 --> 00:02:49.980
<v Speaker 2>no matter how much they earn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case in Estonia,</v>

50
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 2>the income tax is just 20% with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies,</v>

51
00:02:53.131 --> 00:02:56.070
<v Speaker 2>it's easy to see why your stone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're attracted foreign investments,</v>

52
00:02:56.071 --> 00:02:58.590
<v Speaker 2>particularly from the Scandinavian </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

53
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.513
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was still not enough for them to </v>

54
00:03:01.181 --> 00:03:02.014
<v Speaker 2>grow at the rate they want it at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>beginning of the 1990 is less than a </v>

55
00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.900
<v Speaker 2>half of the population had a phone in </v>
<v Speaker 2>their home.</v>

56
00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.973
<v Speaker 2>Further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The infrastructure which was built </v>

57
00:03:09.911 --> 00:03:12.310
<v Speaker 2>during the Soviet era was far for an </v>
<v Speaker 2>acceptable,</v>

58
00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:13.263
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not a great setup for a country </v>

59
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 2>if it isn't looking for economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>development.</v>

60
00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Since the country you had no money to </v>
<v Speaker 2>invest in physical roads,</v>

61
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:23.860
<v Speaker 2>they instead decided to invest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtual roads,</v>

62
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 2>be countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>telecommunications infrastructure,</v>

63
00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:27.573
<v Speaker 2>and just 15 years later it's stonier was</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first country in the world to have </v>

64
00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:35.440
<v Speaker 2>an electronic voting system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on for just a second because all of</v>

65
00:03:35.441 --> 00:03:38.230
<v Speaker 2>these reforms didn't exactly come for </v>
<v Speaker 2>free.</v>

66
00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 2>During these 15 years of forward </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress,</v>

67
00:03:40.661 --> 00:03:43.180
<v Speaker 2>the Russian minority,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which used to rule the country,</v>

68
00:03:43.181 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>became increasingly politically </v>
<v Speaker 2>isolated.</v>

69
00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.880
<v Speaker 2>This is why in 2007 the Kremlin under </v>
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Putin decided,</v>

70
00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:50.714
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

71
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.580
<v Speaker 2>and this is how the first cyber attack </v>
<v Speaker 2>in history,</v>

72
00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:56.414
<v Speaker 2>it was organized and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a cyber attack on a country that relied </v>

73
00:03:59.211 --> 00:04:02.660
<v Speaker 2>heavily on its digital infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a big problem.</v>

74
00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:05.510
<v Speaker 2>During the attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia lost its administration,</v>

75
00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.290
<v Speaker 2>which was so dramatic that even </v>
<v Speaker 2>hospitals were not able to function.</v>

76
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:10.153
<v Speaker 2>This is why since that day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nita has had its cybersecurity </v>

77
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.120
<v Speaker 2>headquarters in Tallinn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Estonian capital bars.</v>

78
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:20.200
<v Speaker 2>This was not the end of Estonia has </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems manage.</v>

79
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.700
<v Speaker 2>She'll crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two years later,</v>

80
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:27.620
<v Speaker 2>in 2009 the financial crisis struck </v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia hot the country.</v>

81
00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:30.860
<v Speaker 2>It was particularly exposed because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>all its foreign investments.</v>

82
00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:33.320
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country had no money.</v>

83
00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.213
<v Speaker 2>Plus this was the time when they were </v>
<v Speaker 2>supposed to adopt the euro as their </v>

84
00:04:36.921 --> 00:04:37.754
<v Speaker 2>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So even if they wanted to make the </v>

85
00:04:39.171 --> 00:04:40.004
<v Speaker 2>switch to the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't have the funds to make that </v>

86
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:44.450
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the government had two options.</v>

87
00:04:44.451 --> 00:04:47.210
<v Speaker 2>They could either cut their spending or </v>
<v Speaker 2>they can raise taxes.</v>

88
00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.060
<v Speaker 2>Unlike other countries like Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia took the first option.</v>

89
00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.073
<v Speaker 2>In a matter of months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government fired over 10,000 </v>

90
00:05:00.361 --> 00:05:01.194
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was about a third of their entire </v>

91
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:05.500
<v Speaker 2>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians and lowered their salary.</v>

92
00:05:05.501 --> 00:05:06.334
<v Speaker 2>Reason froze all state investments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which included many construction </v>

93
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:09.654
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these carts caused the Estonian </v>

94
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.163
<v Speaker 2>GDP to fall by a 14% in that year to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make a comparison in their worst year </v>

95
00:05:17.701 --> 00:05:18.534
<v Speaker 2>during the financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s or their GDP fall by 8% </v>

96
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.433
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after going through a terrible 2009 </v>

97
00:05:24.211 --> 00:05:27.190
<v Speaker 2>Estonia saw its economy began to improve</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost to me.</v>

98
00:05:27.191 --> 00:05:28.024
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:33.013
<v Speaker 2>Since they didn't raise their taxes and </v>
<v Speaker 2>business policies remained very </v>

100
00:05:35.211 --> 00:05:36.044
<v Speaker 2>flexible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of those who lost their jobs at </v>

101
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.060
<v Speaker 2>decided to start companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now let's have a look at that.</v>

102
00:05:41.061 --> 00:05:41.894
<v Speaker 2>Unemployment shot between 2008 and 2009 </v>
<v Speaker 2>is through near went from a 4% </v>

103
00:05:46.191 --> 00:05:47.024
<v Speaker 2>unemployment rate to a 19% unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 2>rate at the time that this was the </v>

104
00:05:50.781 --> 00:05:52.850
<v Speaker 2>highest unemployment rate in all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

105
00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 2>even higher than Greece and Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

106
00:05:55.370 --> 00:05:56.750
<v Speaker 2>the interest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>two years,</v>

107
00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:57.643
<v Speaker 2>they cut this in half and now they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>an admirable 6% unemployment rate and </v>

108
00:06:02.561 --> 00:06:03.394
<v Speaker 2>it's the same goes for their salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today a person working in Tallinn is </v>

109
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:09.770
<v Speaker 2>lung thing to be making more money than </v>
<v Speaker 2>most people in southern Europe.</v>

110
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:10.783
<v Speaker 2>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia is a model for other countries </v>

111
00:06:12.891 --> 00:06:13.724
<v Speaker 2>to follow and now we're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>look at the key aspects of this country </v>

112
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.900
<v Speaker 2>which did make it quite so sick.</v>

113
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:18.883
<v Speaker 1>Assassin</v>

114
00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 2>ministration it's Tony a pioneer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the idea of creating a digital id card.</v>

115
00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:28.133
<v Speaker 2>Now many other countries have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>copying this model but it's not </v>

116
00:06:30.091 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 2>something that has ever been as </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful as it wasn't a stone yet.</v>

117
00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:34.013
<v Speaker 2>The reason that it is so successful in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia is because this ID card is </v>

118
00:06:37.021 --> 00:06:39.120
<v Speaker 2>actually useful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

119
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:39.983
<v Speaker 2>during the elections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>any Estonian citizen can take this med </v>

120
00:06:42.481 --> 00:06:43.314
<v Speaker 2>card,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it cause you any computer and vote </v>

121
00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:45.653
<v Speaker 2>electronically from wherever they are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no need for any sort of </v>

122
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:49.944
<v Speaker 2>registration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is incredibly useful if you are on </v>

123
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:54.970
<v Speaker 2>holiday during an election or if you are</v>
<v Speaker 2>someone who did something</v>

124
00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:57.893
<v Speaker 1>every,</v>

125
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.270
<v Speaker 2>no yours,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the hassle of voting while abroad having</v>

126
00:07:01.271 --> 00:07:04.600
<v Speaker 2>to go to the embassy and cast a ballot,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's all a big headache.</v>

127
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:06.430
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to all of this hassle,</v>

128
00:07:06.431 --> 00:07:10.120
<v Speaker 2>there have been cases where boots from </v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad have simply been lost further.</v>

129
00:07:10.121 --> 00:07:10.954
<v Speaker 2>In Estonia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can use this ID card to do any sort </v>

130
00:07:13.031 --> 00:07:13.864
<v Speaker 2>of government business and that includes</v>
<v Speaker 2>paying your taxes and forget about all </v>

131
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:19.780
<v Speaker 2>of those long forms that are the tax </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorities making.</v>

132
00:07:19.781 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

133
00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:21.133
<v Speaker 1>lounge.</v>

134
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:24.081
<v Speaker 2>Darn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:24.081 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 2>You can do everything from your mobile </v>
<v Speaker 2>phone in a matter of minutes.</v>

136
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.073
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the government has access to the banks </v>

137
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:31.413
<v Speaker 2>so they can simply find your income.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happens in every other country </v>

138
00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:35.053
<v Speaker 2>including the u s the only difference is</v>
<v Speaker 2>that in Estonia they think it's stupid </v>

139
00:07:38.561 --> 00:07:39.394
<v Speaker 2>to ask her the same question twice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So you simply go over your citizen </v>

140
00:07:42.671 --> 00:07:43.504
<v Speaker 2>profile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>confirm that everything's correct and </v>

141
00:07:45.131 --> 00:07:46.960
<v Speaker 2>pay your taxes just like that.</v>

142
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:50.470
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

143
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.650
<v Speaker 2>Hold on for one minutes because the best</v>
<v Speaker 2>is yet to come.</v>

144
00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:54.663
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that an unscrupulous government </v>
<v Speaker 2>employee you wants to spy on your </v>

145
00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.010
<v Speaker 2>personal data.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well then when that happens you will get</v>

146
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:02.470
<v Speaker 2>a notification on your government's </v>
<v Speaker 2>profile.</v>

147
00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:05.680
<v Speaker 2>You can even see exactly who that </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments employee is,</v>

148
00:08:05.681 --> 00:08:06.514
<v Speaker 2>who is looking at your data and then if </v>
<v Speaker 2>you want so you can ask them why they </v>

149
00:08:09.491 --> 00:08:10.324
<v Speaker 2>aren't doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means Estonia in this regard has a </v>

150
00:08:15.911 --> 00:08:18.700
<v Speaker 2>way more transparency than any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>democracy,</v>

151
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.590
<v Speaker 2>but if you still think this is not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough,</v>

152
00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:23.410
<v Speaker 2>here's the part that really puts Estonia</v>
<v Speaker 2>over the,</v>

153
00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:26.553
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

154
00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:27.953
<v Speaker 2>he residency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've all heard about these big </v>

155
00:08:29.761 --> 00:08:30.594
<v Speaker 2>companies that place that fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 2>headquarters in places like Panama or </v>

156
00:08:33.331 --> 00:08:34.530
<v Speaker 2>Luxembourg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

157
00:08:34.531 --> 00:08:38.810
<v Speaker 2>this kind of tax structure is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible for a freelancer or an SME.</v>

158
00:08:38.940 --> 00:08:41.580
<v Speaker 3>I live in Luxembourg and if you want to </v>
<v Speaker 3>start a company in Luxembourg,</v>

159
00:08:41.581 --> 00:08:43.800
<v Speaker 3>you have to go.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You have to start by going to the notary</v>

160
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.023
<v Speaker 3>and to go to the notes or it takes you </v>
<v Speaker 3>three weeks to get an appointment and </v>

161
00:08:48.001 --> 00:08:48.834
<v Speaker 3>then you have to pay a lot of money on.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's an awful lot of bureaucracy and </v>

162
00:08:50.731 --> 00:08:51.540
<v Speaker 3>everything like that.</v>

163
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:52.373
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Estonia they realized that they </v>

164
00:08:53.581 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 2>needed and you citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said,</v>

165
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.220
<v Speaker 2>the country faces a demographic crisis </v>
<v Speaker 2>and well,</v>

166
00:08:58.221 --> 00:08:59.460
<v Speaker 2>welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>weather socks.</v>

167
00:08:59.490 --> 00:09:00.323
<v Speaker 2>That is why in 2014 they decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer their cutting edge infrastructure </v>

168
00:09:03.721 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 2>to the whole world no matter where you </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from and so you might,</v>

169
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:09.060
<v Speaker 2>no one's out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is this quite so useful?</v>

170
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:16.540
<v Speaker 2>Of course this is not the same as an </v>
<v Speaker 2>actual citizenship and you can't use the</v>

171
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:21.040
<v Speaker 2>residency as a passport,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is a digital identity issued by a</v>

172
00:09:21.041 --> 00:09:21.874
<v Speaker 2>European governments and this certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>helps if you want to make international </v>

173
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:27.520
<v Speaker 2>transactions or open a bank accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In Estonia,</v>

174
00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:31.270
<v Speaker 2>this might be particularly useful if you</v>
<v Speaker 2>are watching this video from places like</v>

175
00:09:31.271 --> 00:09:34.810
<v Speaker 2>the Ukraine or weld Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The virtual card also makes it very easy</v>

176
00:09:34.811 --> 00:09:35.644
<v Speaker 2>for you to establish a company in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Estonia and you can do that without </v>

177
00:09:38.051 --> 00:09:40.160
<v Speaker 2>having to move there or do a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated.</v>

178
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:41.403
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

179
00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:45.193
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now I hear you saying is stony is </v>

180
00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.230
<v Speaker 2>got to be a fiscal haven,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

181
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually no,</v>

182
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:53.840
<v Speaker 2>corporate tax is 20% which is the same </v>
<v Speaker 2>as Finland's for example.</v>

183
00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:57.290
<v Speaker 2>What is thrown at really offers is two </v>
<v Speaker 2>main things,</v>

184
00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.680
<v Speaker 2>simplicity and to rule of law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

185
00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:01.550
<v Speaker 2>maybe you think that is too little to </v>
<v Speaker 2>offer,</v>

186
00:10:01.551 --> 00:10:02.384
<v Speaker 2>but the reality is over 10,000 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>have already signed up for this virtual </v>

187
00:10:05.901 --> 00:10:06.734
<v Speaker 2>residency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is actually the Japanese </v>

188
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:13.391
<v Speaker 2>Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

189
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:16.960
<v Speaker 2>it's Stonier has invented a brand's new </v>
<v Speaker 2>concepts.</v>

190
00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:19.620
<v Speaker 2>The concept of liquid citizens.</v>

191
00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:26.410
<v Speaker 2>I know it is all big question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think other countries will follow</v>

192
00:10:26.411 --> 00:10:27.244
<v Speaker 2>the Estonian model?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think there is a time when </v>

193
00:10:29.141 --> 00:10:31.080
<v Speaker 2>everyone were ones who were racist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stony,</v>

194
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:33.800
<v Speaker 2>and citizenship?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can leave your answer in the comment</v>
