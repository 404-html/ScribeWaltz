1
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.630
<v Speaker 1>Amazing is the only rock dance with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own private jets.</v>

2
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 1>And do you know who the pilot of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot jet might be?</v>

3
00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:14.441
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

4
00:00:14.441 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>That's none other than the lead singer </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bruce Dickenson.</v>

5
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.213
<v Speaker 1>And listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are not many people who deserve </v>

6
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:19.804
<v Speaker 1>more admiration than Mr Dickinson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it wasn't enough to be one of the </v>

7
00:00:22.031 --> 00:00:24.310
<v Speaker 1>most successful heavy metal singers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.560
<v Speaker 1>he's also an experienced commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>pilot,</v>

9
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:28.330
<v Speaker 1>a radio host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a writer,</v>

10
00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.263
<v Speaker 1>an ownership into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm the CEO of one of the most </v>

11
00:00:30.821 --> 00:00:33.130
<v Speaker 1>innovative aviation companies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>

12
00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.120
<v Speaker 1>As you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Might be wondering,</v>

13
00:00:34.121 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are we talking about Bruce Dickinson</v>

14
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.660
<v Speaker 1>on visual politic?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:40.450
<v Speaker 1>what does iron maiden have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics at all?</v>

16
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me</v>

17
00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.423
<v Speaker 2>tell you,</v>

18
00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.673
<v Speaker 1>maiden singer Bruce Dickinson's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cardiff aviation signs on to manage </v>

19
00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.053
<v Speaker 1>national carrier for Djibouti Palsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Aviation is a company that provides </v>

20
00:00:51.851 --> 00:00:55.870
<v Speaker 1>maintenance to airline companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that iron maiden has landed</v>

21
00:00:55.871 --> 00:00:56.704
<v Speaker 1>in Djibouti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this case they didn't come to </v>

22
00:00:58.841 --> 00:01:00.730
<v Speaker 1>perform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They came to sell airplanes,</v>

23
00:01:00.731 --> 00:01:05.620
<v Speaker 1>train the pilots and design a system so </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Djibouti can have its own airlines.</v>

24
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.060
<v Speaker 1>But just wait a minute because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the really important thing here.</v>

25
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:13.150
<v Speaker 1>You might think that the airlines have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country like judy owns a big deal,</v>

26
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:14.733
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a really poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>country located in the Horn of Africa </v>

28
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.580
<v Speaker 1>with a population of less than a million</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

29
00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:23.850
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought,</v>

30
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.850
<v Speaker 1>what if I told you the debussy has a big</v>
<v Speaker 1>chance of becoming the next Dubai.</v>

31
00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.753
<v Speaker 1>What if Bruce Dickinson is actually one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the first vision reason to decide to </v>

32
00:01:32.491 --> 00:01:33.324
<v Speaker 1>invest in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it while you look at this </v>

33
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.760
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here it is true,</v>

34
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.440
<v Speaker 1>but now this is the Suez Canal and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the Red Sea.</v>

35
00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Any oil tanker who wants to go from Abu </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dhabi to Europe must pass through here.</v>

36
00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.150
<v Speaker 1>All of those Chinese mobile phones sold </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the UK,</v>

37
00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.103
<v Speaker 1>travel through this area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't have 10 ships that sail the </v>

38
00:01:51.421 --> 00:01:54.180
<v Speaker 1>planet are passing in front of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Djiboutian coasts.</v>

39
00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.000
<v Speaker 1>But make no mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a quiet region.</v>

40
00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:58.590
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is true.</v>

41
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Remember the Somali pirates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.613
<v Speaker 1>this is Somalia and this other thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>called [inaudible] and it's not a chill </v>

43
00:02:04.681 --> 00:02:06.930
<v Speaker 1>place either and this other thing you </v>
<v Speaker 1>see on the map,</v>

44
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 1>this is called Yemen and it's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of a civil war.</v>

45
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.123
<v Speaker 1>It turns out your booties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only peaceful country in the entire </v>

46
00:02:12.961 --> 00:02:13.794
<v Speaker 1>room.</v>

47
00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.330
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute once again because they</v>

48
00:02:19.331 --> 00:02:20.710
<v Speaker 1>still more here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

49
00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.740
<v Speaker 1>if you've been following this channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

50
00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:24.693
<v Speaker 1>you should already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Ethiopia is one of the fastest </v>

51
00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:27.693
<v Speaker 1>growing countries on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are becoming a textile superpower </v>

52
00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.910
<v Speaker 1>and they have more than 90 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

53
00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.030
<v Speaker 1>And guess what else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia has got no coast.</v>

54
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.970
<v Speaker 1>This means whenever they want to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>their tax dollars,</v>

55
00:02:39.971 --> 00:02:43.360
<v Speaker 1>they have to do so through the Djibouti </v>
<v Speaker 1>port and yes,</v>

56
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.670
<v Speaker 1>I can probably guess what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>

57
00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:46.653
<v Speaker 1>Are we really talking about a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore or Dubai or is the something </v>

58
00:02:50.591 --> 00:02:51.424
<v Speaker 1>missing here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe you might be thinking now </v>

59
00:02:52.731 --> 00:02:54.960
<v Speaker 1>what should I be like Bruce Dickinson </v>
<v Speaker 1>and invest in?</v>

60
00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer all of </v>

61
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:00.520
<v Speaker 1>those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before do as always,</v>

62
00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.640
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>location,</v>

63
00:03:07.381 --> 00:03:08.640
<v Speaker 1>location,</v>
<v Speaker 1>location.</v>

64
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:09.503
<v Speaker 1>I'll do everything I just said about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some of you might be thinking right </v>

65
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:12.660
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

66
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.850
<v Speaker 1>why have I never heard of this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>before?</v>

67
00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:15.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that lies in their </v>

68
00:03:16.921 --> 00:03:17.754
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not really very different from </v>

69
00:03:19.261 --> 00:03:19.760
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

70
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:20.593
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

71
00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.820
<v Speaker 1>in the year 1977,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a peaceful referendum,</v>

72
00:03:25.821 --> 00:03:26.654
<v Speaker 1>Djibouti became the latest country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain independence from their French </v>

73
00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:33.590
<v Speaker 1>colonizers and just as it happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar cases too,</v>

74
00:03:33.591 --> 00:03:38.591
<v Speaker 1>but he became a one party dictate until </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 19 nineties,</v>

75
00:03:41.421 --> 00:03:46.421
<v Speaker 1>Mr Hassan Goulet apted on and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of his tribe controlled the fate</v>

76
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.503
<v Speaker 1>of this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sponsoring members of the opposition </v>

77
00:03:49.281 --> 00:03:53.030
<v Speaker 1>became a common practice and the ruling </v>
<v Speaker 1>party got really,</v>

78
00:03:53.031 --> 00:03:55.160
<v Speaker 1>really rich off the profits from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>port.</v>

79
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.173
<v Speaker 1>Now you could say that back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>GBC was a textbook example of a gate </v>

80
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:02.960
<v Speaker 1>keeper state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in such poor countries,</v>

81
00:04:02.961 --> 00:04:06.170
<v Speaker 1>the whole economy is dependent on just </v>
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>

82
00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.330
<v Speaker 1>In the case of editorial Guinea for </v>
<v Speaker 1>instance,</v>

83
00:04:08.331 --> 00:04:10.790
<v Speaker 1>that thing is oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of Jersey,</v>

84
00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 1>well that would be it's port.</v>

85
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Since the dictators have no money to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big army to control the whole country,</v>

86
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.273
<v Speaker 1>they must focus all of their oppressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>powers in the area where the money is </v>

87
00:04:25.061 --> 00:04:25.894
<v Speaker 1>located,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Djibouti port was completely secured </v>

88
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.150
<v Speaker 1>while the rest of the country was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>total chaos.</v>

89
00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.580
<v Speaker 1>There were murders on the streets that </v>
<v Speaker 1>was rape.</v>

90
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 1>There were all kinds of other horrific </v>
<v Speaker 1>crimes.</v>

91
00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.440
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can probably imagine,</v>

92
00:04:38.441 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>this is not the ideal situation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create companies or to track any sort of</v>

93
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:44.014
<v Speaker 1>foreign investments now that in fact </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the nineties as civil war </v>

94
00:04:46.871 --> 00:04:47.704
<v Speaker 1>started between the governments and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition parties and tribes and it's </v>

95
00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>all not exactly a recipe for success</v>

96
00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.113
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is where the first difference </v>

97
00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:03.060
<v Speaker 1>between Djibouti and the rest of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbor countries comes in.</v>

98
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:07.260
<v Speaker 1>The way the government's solved their </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem was surprising to everybody.</v>

99
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:08.153
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after years of bloody fighting and </v>

100
00:05:09.361 --> 00:05:12.090
<v Speaker 1>thousands of killings on both sides of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the battle,</v>

101
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.380
<v Speaker 1>Mr went to the other party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called fronts for the restoration</v>

102
00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.310
<v Speaker 1>of unity and democracy and essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>said to them,</v>

103
00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:21.203
<v Speaker 1>they're dudes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

104
00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.280
<v Speaker 1>get a grip.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is money for everyone here.</v>

105
00:05:23.281 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>Why can't we share it all and just stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting each other and this.</v>

106
00:05:27.111 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 1>This is how to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you got its first unity government,</v>

107
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 1>a government that combines most of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>local political party.</v>

108
00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.833
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

109
00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.660
<v Speaker 1>Now there is still political opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Djibouti though,</v>

110
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.494
<v Speaker 1>but they can really not even meet </v>
<v Speaker 1>campaigns and navy signed that on </v>

111
00:05:43.701 --> 00:05:46.350
<v Speaker 1>presidential elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are essentially causes.</v>

112
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.293
<v Speaker 1>This explains why Amazon ads laser has </v>
<v Speaker 1>his nephew the late when the elections </v>

113
00:05:50.991 --> 00:05:54.170
<v Speaker 1>with outcomes close to 100 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vote.</v>

114
00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.063
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly a leaving democracy </v>

115
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.360
<v Speaker 1>bus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is just the beginning.</v>

116
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 1>Despite the internal fights by the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>2011,</v>

117
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.100
<v Speaker 1>but it was still a very corrupt country </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a very weak position.</v>

118
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

119
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a really small </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

120
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>less than 1 million inhabitants placed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the middle of one of the most violent</v>

121
00:06:14.271 --> 00:06:19.271
<v Speaker 1>regions on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean Somalia,</v>

122
00:06:20.951 --> 00:06:24.280
<v Speaker 1>which is virtually anarchy where </v>
<v Speaker 1>different tribes that constantly at each</v>

123
00:06:24.281 --> 00:06:26.500
<v Speaker 1>other's throat span.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then on the other side,</v>

124
00:06:26.501 --> 00:06:30.910
<v Speaker 1>we have Eritrea a dictatorship that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes North Korea looked like Sweden and</v>

125
00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:31.773
<v Speaker 1>in the south of course this Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest regional power and one who </v>

126
00:06:35.201 --> 00:06:39.280
<v Speaker 1>had any moments would be happy to invade</v>
<v Speaker 1>your booty so they can have a coastline.</v>

127
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:40.173
<v Speaker 1>So in summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were far from being in a peaceful </v>

128
00:06:42.701 --> 00:06:43.534
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then when everything seemed to be </v>

129
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:46.624
<v Speaker 1>against them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history decided to give the country a </v>

130
00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:50.110
<v Speaker 1>marvelous break.</v>

131
00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:52.593
<v Speaker 3>Our enemy is a radical network of </v>
<v Speaker 3>terrorists and every government that </v>

132
00:06:56.631 --> 00:06:57.464
<v Speaker 3>supports them,</v>

133
00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.040
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden America with George W </v>
<v Speaker 1>dot Bush as their president declared war</v>

134
00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.010
<v Speaker 1>on terrorism and this meant sending </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops to all the areas where our cells,</v>

135
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.983
<v Speaker 1>what presence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes of course with a Horn of </v>

136
00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.400
<v Speaker 1>Africa and is there any better place for</v>
<v Speaker 1>building military basis than shebooty.</v>

137
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.670
<v Speaker 1>It has a peerless location and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments that corrupt as it is,</v>

138
00:07:19.671 --> 00:07:20.504
<v Speaker 1>congratulates itself for being stable </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having no ties with terrorist </v>

139
00:07:23.811 --> 00:07:24.650
<v Speaker 1>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

140
00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.513
<v Speaker 1>do you remember when I told you that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Red Sea is extremely dangerous for </v>

141
00:07:27.951 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>merchant ships?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know all the pirates and stuff?</v>

142
00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the camp lemon airbase,</v>

143
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.233
<v Speaker 1>American troops can chase those Somali </v>
<v Speaker 1>pirates and not only the Americans can </v>

144
00:07:35.451 --> 00:07:38.330
<v Speaker 1>do this in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The list of countries who have installed</v>

145
00:07:38.331 --> 00:07:41.130
<v Speaker 1>military bases in Djibouti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much never ending.</v>

146
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.153
<v Speaker 1>We can indeed find French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italian and Spanish troops that indeed </v>

147
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>the only place where Japan has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>military base abroad is turbidity and as</v>

148
00:07:53.601 --> 00:07:54.434
<v Speaker 1>you might be able to imagine with so </v>
<v Speaker 1>many wells powers having a military </v>

149
00:07:57.111 --> 00:07:58.520
<v Speaker 1>presence here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

150
00:07:58.730 --> 00:07:59.563
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is where China comes into the </v>

151
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:01.270
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

152
00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:02.103
<v Speaker 3>Job</v>

153
00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.890
<v Speaker 1>Opens first overseas base in Djibouti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

154
00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:08.070
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in such a poor in small country,</v>

155
00:08:08.071 --> 00:08:11.790
<v Speaker 1>having so many foreign armies is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic deal.</v>

156
00:08:11.791 --> 00:08:12.601
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>

157
00:08:12.601 --> 00:08:14.790
<v Speaker 1>All of these soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need food to eat,</v>

158
00:08:14.791 --> 00:08:17.070
<v Speaker 1>they have to shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they also need to have some fun.</v>

159
00:08:17.220 --> 00:08:21.660
<v Speaker 1>This means lots of jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of money for the entire country and</v>

160
00:08:21.661 --> 00:08:24.600
<v Speaker 1>on top of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always the biggest problem Djibouti</v>

161
00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:25.830
<v Speaker 1>had for investments</v>

162
00:08:29.670 --> 00:08:29.850
<v Speaker 3>with</v>

163
00:08:29.850 --> 00:08:30.683
<v Speaker 1>so many military bases in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only an insane best and would dare to </v>

164
00:08:33.211 --> 00:08:34.500
<v Speaker 1>invade them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

165
00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:38.100
<v Speaker 1>there are few places in Africa that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>safer than shebooty nowadays,</v>

166
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:39.053
<v Speaker 1>add to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the perfect situation for international </v>

167
00:08:40.291 --> 00:08:41.124
<v Speaker 1>trade routes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can easily understand why this </v>

168
00:08:42.751 --> 00:08:43.584
<v Speaker 1>country has been growing at a five </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent annual rate since the day </v>

169
00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>American troops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that boots on the ground,</v>

170
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.870
<v Speaker 1>as you might've guessed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

171
00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:55.260
<v Speaker 1>not everything is perfectly wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hip spiked this growth.</v>

172
00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.830
<v Speaker 1>Djibouti still has an unemployment rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher than 50 percent.</v>

173
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

174
00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:04.510
<v Speaker 1>One out of two Djibouti eons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No stable job.</v>

175
00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.433
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are lines that Bruce Dickinson </v>

176
00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:11.140
<v Speaker 1>helps creative just sending soldiers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>people from ngos that traveled to places</v>

177
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:12.063
<v Speaker 1>like Somalia or Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just wait a minute here because </v>

178
00:09:15.221 --> 00:09:17.920
<v Speaker 1>the times they're certainly changing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

179
00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:25.560
<v Speaker 1>man and his vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this name?</v>

180
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.740
<v Speaker 1>Alias Mosa Dowell a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be thinking,</v>

181
00:09:28.741 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the new president rice.</v>

182
00:09:30.540 --> 00:09:31.373
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

183
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.213
<v Speaker 1>certainly not to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but has kept the same president for the </v>

184
00:09:34.681 --> 00:09:36.690
<v Speaker 1>past 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This man,</v>

185
00:09:36.750 --> 00:09:37.583
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the minister of Economy and </v>

186
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:40.470
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this case,</v>

187
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>the finance minister is even more famous</v>
<v Speaker 1>than the president.</v>

188
00:09:46.130 --> 00:09:46.963
<v Speaker 1>We needed to plan over a longer period.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We accept that we will probably not be </v>

189
00:09:50.001 --> 00:09:53.210
<v Speaker 1>able to achieve all of our objectives </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the current administration.</v>

190
00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.373
<v Speaker 1>The Vision Twenty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 clearly sets out the aspirations of </v>

191
00:09:56.841 --> 00:09:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the president and his government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Les.</v>

192
00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.050
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Musar Darwalla.</v>

193
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:00.973
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been following visual politic </v>

194
00:10:01.671 --> 00:10:02.504
<v Speaker 1>for awhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this vision 20 slash 35 thing will </v>

195
00:10:04.371 --> 00:10:05.204
<v Speaker 1>probably remind you of something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember this video where I told </v>

196
00:10:07.551 --> 00:10:10.820
<v Speaker 1>you about Rwanda's road out of poverty?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This vision 20,</v>

197
00:10:10.821 --> 00:10:14.360
<v Speaker 1>35 is a carbon copy of Rwanda's plants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many aspects,</v>

198
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.373
<v Speaker 1>the gbt governments wants their ports to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have state of the art technology just </v>

199
00:10:18.441 --> 00:10:22.310
<v Speaker 1>like those of Singapore and Dubai for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this while they need money,</v>

200
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.800
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aa also knows there's.</v>

201
00:10:24.801 --> 00:10:25.634
<v Speaker 1>In order to make the economy work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to diversify as if a country </v>

202
00:10:32.341 --> 00:10:33.174
<v Speaker 1>only relies on one single industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A small crisis could easily be the </v>

203
00:10:36.901 --> 00:10:38.250
<v Speaker 1>country's downfold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That again,</v>

204
00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:39.173
<v Speaker 1>if you want to diversify your economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you still need money and you need a </v>

205
00:10:41.701 --> 00:10:42.534
<v Speaker 1>business friendly environments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption and lack of rule of law up </v>

206
00:10:45.850 --> 00:10:47.310
<v Speaker 1>seldom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends have businesses,</v>

207
00:10:47.311 --> 00:10:49.590
<v Speaker 1>kinds of foreign investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in these areas,</v>

208
00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Djibouti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they get a gold medal,</v>

209
00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the poor being the main economic</v>

210
00:10:54.061 --> 00:10:57.210
<v Speaker 1>driver in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can see the accounting books.</v>

211
00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:58.133
<v Speaker 1>This means many governments officials </v>
<v Speaker 1>are getting rich or without anyone </v>

212
00:11:01.501 --> 00:11:02.334
<v Speaker 1>knowing.</v>

213
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.013
<v Speaker 1>If this was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the local legislation is based </v>

214
00:11:08.121 --> 00:11:08.954
<v Speaker 1>on sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody can even protest this fact </v>

215
00:11:11.540 --> 00:11:12.373
<v Speaker 1>because Djibouti is among the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries with the lowest freedom of </v>

216
00:11:14.631 --> 00:11:17.300
<v Speaker 1>speech in the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In just 2016,</v>

217
00:11:17.301 --> 00:11:18.134
<v Speaker 1>the government sent three BBC </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists to jail because they wanted </v>

218
00:11:21.351 --> 00:11:23.540
<v Speaker 1>to talk about election fraud.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

219
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.463
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is certainly hurting the country's </v>

220
00:11:26.241 --> 00:11:28.610
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and what's worse?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

221
00:11:28.611 --> 00:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

222
00:11:31.460 --> 00:11:32.293
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ruling class is already making </v>

223
00:11:34.221 --> 00:11:36.470
<v Speaker 1>enough money from the port and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rents.</v>

224
00:11:36.471 --> 00:11:38.440
<v Speaker 1>They guess from all of those foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>army</v>

225
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:42.740
<v Speaker 2>feather.</v>

226
00:11:42.740 --> 00:11:43.573
<v Speaker 1>They also have enough security that </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes them not afraid of a popular </v>

227
00:11:45.591 --> 00:11:46.910
<v Speaker 1>uprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

228
00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:50.150
<v Speaker 1>if Dalloway the finance minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to change the political system,</v>

229
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:51.073
<v Speaker 1>and as he says in his vision 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>35 paper and prove the governance over </v>

230
00:11:54.071 --> 00:11:56.680
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has an impossible job,</v>

231
00:11:56.990 --> 00:11:57.823
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

232
00:11:57.860 --> 00:11:59.980
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well sometimes miracles,</v>

233
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>they do happen.</v>

234
00:12:03.850 --> 00:12:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Jody breaks ground on massive Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>backed free trade zone.</v>

235
00:12:06.860 --> 00:12:07.850
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've gone,</v>

236
00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Shane's the whole political system in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire country,</v>

237
00:12:11.090 --> 00:12:14.930
<v Speaker 1>just change a little part of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this special economic zone,</v>

238
00:12:14.931 --> 00:12:18.650
<v Speaker 1>everyone can buy property and build </v>
<v Speaker 1>without having to wait months and months</v>

239
00:12:18.651 --> 00:12:21.710
<v Speaker 1>to get government permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes it harder for governments.</v>

240
00:12:21.711 --> 00:12:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Officials who wants to take bribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

241
00:12:24.501 --> 00:12:25.334
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand is all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations are going to follow Chinese </v>

242
00:12:27.381 --> 00:12:28.220
<v Speaker 1>law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

243
00:12:28.221 --> 00:12:31.520
<v Speaker 1>This is a little short of a tiny little </v>
<v Speaker 1>shenzen in the middle of a country.</v>

244
00:12:34.790 --> 00:12:37.610
<v Speaker 1>The agreement calls for the zone to </v>
<v Speaker 1>handle $7,000,000,000</v>

245
00:12:37.611 --> 00:12:39.710
<v Speaker 1>worth of trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or within two years,</v>

246
00:12:40.190 --> 00:12:41.023
<v Speaker 1>Judi will create a unified customer </v>
<v Speaker 1>system with trainer establish a trade </v>

247
00:12:44.091 --> 00:12:49.091
<v Speaker 1>center and set up a currency clearance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

248
00:12:52.451 --> 00:12:54.490
<v Speaker 1>what can we expect now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

249
00:12:54.491 --> 00:12:55.324
<v Speaker 1>the idea of making special economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>zones is certainly nothing new and it's </v>

250
00:12:58.601 --> 00:13:00.820
<v Speaker 1>been proven to work many times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

251
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:05.560
<v Speaker 1>this is the system that let Dubai become</v>
<v Speaker 1>the metropolis that it is today.</v>

252
00:13:05.650 --> 00:13:08.140
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that when you have a special</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic zone,</v>

253
00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.003
<v Speaker 1>both the citizens and the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>leads can see firsthand what happens </v>

254
00:13:12.130 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>when you have transparent laws and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good framework for companies to follow.</v>

255
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:20.693
<v Speaker 1>If this experiment works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians will be more willing to </v>

256
00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:25.650
<v Speaker 1>implement real changes in the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

257
00:13:25.740 --> 00:13:27.150
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in summary,</v>

258
00:13:27.151 --> 00:13:27.984
<v Speaker 1>we have an African country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>security is granted by foreign armies </v>

259
00:13:31.201 --> 00:13:34.050
<v Speaker 1>and he was starting to apply serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms.</v>

260
00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:35.033
<v Speaker 1>We have a country with the perfect </v>
<v Speaker 1>location in science to become a </v>

261
00:13:37.021 --> 00:13:41.310
<v Speaker 1>financial and logistical sensor in one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the busiest areas on the planets.</v>

262
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:45.750
<v Speaker 1>So it seems that Mr Dickinson has found </v>
<v Speaker 1>a virgin paradise for investments.</v>

263
00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

264
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:49.370
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a second because this does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not enjoy.</v>

265
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Beauty is going to become a freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 1>human rights haven.</v>

266
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.100
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither China nor does by.</v>

267
00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:58.020
<v Speaker 1>Oh really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such havens either.</v>

268
00:13:58.110 --> 00:14:02.730
<v Speaker 1>But this can be at least the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the end for poverty in this region.</v>

269
00:14:06.970 --> 00:14:07.803
<v Speaker 1>So the question now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think these positive </v>

270
00:14:10.061 --> 00:14:12.160
<v Speaker 1>predictions do you think they'll become </v>
<v Speaker 1>true?</v>

271
00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:13.143
<v Speaker 1>Is this a good time to invest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Djibouti or is this going to amount to </v>

272
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.250
<v Speaker 1>nothing more than just hopeful </v>
<v Speaker 1>predictions?</v>
