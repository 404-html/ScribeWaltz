00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.613
<v Speaker 1>Thirty years ago in 1917,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian revolution defeated the </v>

2
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>Russian empire after more than three </v>
<v Speaker 1>centuries of czarist rule,</v>

3
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:22.860
<v Speaker 1>the Romanovs were replaced in a violence</v>
<v Speaker 1>wave,</v>

4
00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.713
<v Speaker 1>other Soviet regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the seed that would turn into the </v>

5
00:00:25.511 --> 00:00:26.344
<v Speaker 1>Soviet,</v>

6
00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.680
<v Speaker 1>but the results of this wasn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>more freedom for the Russian people.</v>

7
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:37.780
<v Speaker 1>How are the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a history video.</v>

8
00:00:37.781 --> 00:00:38.614
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to discuss the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather the present and that's </v>

9
00:00:41.531 --> 00:00:42.364
<v Speaker 1>because many are seeing the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in Russia as the rebirth of a </v>

10
00:00:45.881 --> 00:00:46.714
<v Speaker 1>new cyrus regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But is it fair to really talk about a </v>

11
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.453
<v Speaker 1>new czarist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia isn't perhaps some kind of </v>

12
00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.770
<v Speaker 1>overreaction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.000
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

14
00:00:55.001 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 1>in this video you're also going to learn</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the fastest way to become rich,</v>

15
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.970
<v Speaker 1>filthy rich and facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry,</v>

16
00:01:00.971 --> 00:01:01.804
<v Speaker 1>we haven't gotten insane and we're not </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to try and tell you about a great </v>

17
00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:06.160
<v Speaker 1>opportunity you're missing out on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>pyramid scheme xY,</v>

18
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.940
<v Speaker 1>,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Z.</v>

19
00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.140
<v Speaker 1>I'll explain more in a bit.</v>

20
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.930
<v Speaker 1>Around 18 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the 30,</v>

21
00:01:24.931 --> 00:01:27.750
<v Speaker 1>first of December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1999 are still unknown.</v>

22
00:01:27.751 --> 00:01:31.710
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin became the president of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and in 2018,</v>

23
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.544
<v Speaker 1>Putin will likely win the elections and </v>
<v Speaker 1>remained presidents for another six </v>

24
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.144
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when this next legislative term is </v>

25
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>finished in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24,</v>

26
00:01:38.971 --> 00:01:43.380
<v Speaker 1>cute in that will have already ruled </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia for 25 years and this is a longer</v>

27
00:01:43.381 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>period of role than many of the songs </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Russia's pre-revolution history.</v>

28
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:47.723
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin has developed a political system </v>

29
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:51.990
<v Speaker 1>with a close resemblance to that of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>older Russian empire.</v>

30
00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.940
<v Speaker 1>Boozing has developed a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>political system,</v>

31
00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:57.700
<v Speaker 1>but with a personal touch and just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dusting of Soviet seasoning.</v>

32
00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.853
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's new regime has restored two of </v>

33
00:02:01.081 --> 00:02:04.800
<v Speaker 1>the main features of the older ussr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and repression.</v>

34
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.670
<v Speaker 1>Opposition leader Alexei Navalny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jailed as 1,750 arrested during protests</v>

35
00:02:10.771 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>across Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

36
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:14.490
<v Speaker 1>With Putin and charge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that the secret service and</v>

37
00:02:14.491 --> 00:02:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the political police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which once was the old kgb,</v>

38
00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I've come back to life and they are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the Federal Security Service.</v>

39
00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.520
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first things boot in did when</v>

40
00:02:23.521 --> 00:02:24.354
<v Speaker 1>he reached was to take control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>television and the media and set up a </v>

41
00:02:27.451 --> 00:02:31.590
<v Speaker 1>powerful campaign of patriotic </v>
<v Speaker 1>glorification with a clear goal.</v>

42
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.230
<v Speaker 1>That goal being to get people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribe to the notion that,</v>

43
00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:35.123
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bruce and Sarah and Russia's amazing </v>

44
00:02:36.361 --> 00:02:37.081
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>

45
00:02:37.081 --> 00:02:39.330
<v Speaker 1>but if we consider the use of propaganda</v>
<v Speaker 1>rindge,</v>

46
00:02:39.331 --> 00:02:41.670
<v Speaker 1>repression of Soviet heritage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly,</v>

47
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>why are we talking about a new saw?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:46.824
<v Speaker 1>that's partly because he has restored </v>
<v Speaker 1>the close alliance between the Orthodox </v>

49
00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.933
<v Speaker 1>Church and the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but mainly because Putin has </v>

50
00:02:51.901 --> 00:02:52.734
<v Speaker 1>consolidated a state controlled by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful oligarchy that is similar to </v>

51
00:02:56.131 --> 00:02:59.590
<v Speaker 1>the old feudal system or the aristocracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Russian empire.</v>

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.483
<v Speaker 1>You See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin has befriended a group of people </v>

53
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:05.830
<v Speaker 1>to whom he has granted control of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>big companies in the country and whom he</v>

54
00:03:05.831 --> 00:03:06.940
<v Speaker 1>has made very rich.</v>

55
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:07.813
<v Speaker 1>I remember when I told you we were going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to tell you the fastest way to become a </v>

56
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:11.260
<v Speaker 1>multimillionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:11.261 --> 00:03:14.380
<v Speaker 1>this is the formula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the friend Vladimir Putin,</v>

58
00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:16.810
<v Speaker 1>so believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll consider this.</v>

59
00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.080
<v Speaker 1>We can talk about Sergei roles again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's childhood friends.</v>

60
00:03:20.081 --> 00:03:20.914
<v Speaker 1>He received around $2,000,000,000 in </v>
<v Speaker 1>government funds or other close friends </v>

61
00:03:23.621 --> 00:03:24.454
<v Speaker 1>like ego section,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's old chief of staff or Alexi </v>

62
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.080
<v Speaker 1>Miller and all his collaborator and </v>
<v Speaker 1>consultants,</v>

63
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.500
<v Speaker 1>or there's Sergei tremor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>resolve and old friends from the KGB.</v>

64
00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.363
<v Speaker 1>They are all multimillionaires today and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the ceos of some of the most </v>

65
00:03:36.011 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 1>important state owned companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gazprom and and Ross tack no bad.</v>

66
00:03:40.721 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you think for a moment,</v>

67
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.970
<v Speaker 1>these are isolated situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are tons of examples.</v>

68
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.200
<v Speaker 1>Tymchenko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rosenberg,</v>

69
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:48.443
<v Speaker 1>truck Shama love.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can be definitely said that if you </v>

70
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>are friends you aren't doing or right </v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>

71
00:03:52.961 --> 00:03:53.794
<v Speaker 1>Many of these people appear in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Forbes list of the wealthiest people in </v>

72
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.330
<v Speaker 1>the world and it is not just them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean these people,</v>

73
00:03:58.331 --> 00:03:59.164
<v Speaker 1>they're now getting old and they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>passing on that wealth to their </v>

74
00:04:00.971 --> 00:04:01.804
<v Speaker 1>children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is normal to see many of these big </v>

75
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.053
<v Speaker 1>national companies that have grown </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormously since Putin reached power </v>

76
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.450
<v Speaker 1>being run by the 25 to 35 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>children of Putin's friends.</v>

77
00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>Degas Lucas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nikolai Shama law,</v>

78

80
00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.073
<v Speaker 1>He became the CEO of gas phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important retirement </v>

81
00:04:25.491 --> 00:04:27.400
<v Speaker 1>funds in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other Kirill,</v>

<v Speaker 1>They large state controls petrochemical </v>

83
00:04:31.161 --> 00:04:34.220
<v Speaker 1>company when he was just 25 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

84
00:04:34.221 --> 00:04:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Carol Marriott's Putin's daughter soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>after,</v>

85
00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.970
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's an LV,</v>

86

<v Speaker 1>fortune exceeding $1,000,000,000.</v>

87
00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.153
<v Speaker 1>Indeed the prime minister Dmitry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Medvedev hasn't been accused of getting </v>

88
00:04:45.531 --> 00:04:49.160
<v Speaker 1>rich from the state and having palaces </v>
<v Speaker 1>and vineyards all over Russia.</v>

89
00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:50.023
<v Speaker 1>I'm actually going to link to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>documentary that exposed all of this in </v>

90
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:55.280
<v Speaker 1>the description below.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is absolutely worth or watch,</v>

91
00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:59.330
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering why is</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin doing all of this is just a really</v>

92
00:04:59.331 --> 00:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>generous dues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:02.900
<v Speaker 1>whether he is or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is not.</v>

94
00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:03.733
<v Speaker 1>His real goal here is not just making </v>
<v Speaker 1>his friends rich because they are his </v>

95
00:05:07.131 --> 00:05:07.964
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well Putin is trying to do with this </v>

96
00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:14.750
<v Speaker 1>strategy is grant himself control over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources of the state as well.</v>

97
00:05:14.751 --> 00:05:16.310
<v Speaker 1>Who's paying for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

98
00:05:16.311 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 1>that would be these citizens of Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

99
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:20.960

<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

100
00:05:20.961 --> 00:05:22.700
<v Speaker 1>religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda for state control,</v>

101
00:05:22.701 --> 00:05:23.534
<v Speaker 1>control over all economic and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues in Russian society and these </v>

102
00:05:26.931 --> 00:05:27.764
<v Speaker 1>makeup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main ingredients of the political </v>

103

<v Speaker 1>regime created by this and use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it goes beyond Zanny ideological </v>

104
00:05:33.501 --> 00:05:35.120
<v Speaker 1>reproach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what [inaudible] Jones,</v>

<v Speaker 1>chauvinism,</v>

110
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.380
<v Speaker 1>nationalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's in bed with rapacious oligarchs and</v>

111
00:05:48.381 --> 00:05:50.700
<v Speaker 1>who is admired by the European and </v>

<v Speaker 1>oligarchic regimes,</v>

114

<v Speaker 1>the Russian people and their deserve </v>
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>

115
00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.650
<v Speaker 1>Owen Jones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while now you might be wondering.</v>

116
00:06:00.651 --> 00:06:02.090
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what about outside of Russia?</v>

117
00:06:02.091 --> 00:06:02.924
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much power does Vladimir Putin and </v>

118
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:06.170
<v Speaker 1>command on the world stage?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

119
00:06:06.171 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>as we already said in a previous video </v>
<v Speaker 1>about China,</v>

120
00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.070
<v Speaker 1>we can understand power as influence and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can observe three brunches,</v>

121
00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.540
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and political.</v>

122
00:06:15.541 --> 00:06:16.374
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

123
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:22.150
<v Speaker 1>Rebirth of a Titan,</v>

124
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:25.053
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia into one of the countries with </v>

125
00:06:26.831 --> 00:06:28.930
<v Speaker 1>the highest relative spend on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>

126
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.380
<v Speaker 1>way above China and the USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look at this chart while the</v>

127
00:06:32.381 --> 00:06:33.214
<v Speaker 1>US is spending approximately nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the government's budget and </v>

128
00:06:35.591 --> 00:06:36.424
<v Speaker 1>China is spending around six percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is spending more than 15 percent </v>

129
00:06:39.251 --> 00:06:43.750
<v Speaker 1>of the budget supporting the army right </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the fall of the Soviet Union in 19</v>

130
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:44.643
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the image of Russian forces was a rusty </v>

131
00:06:46.631 --> 00:06:47.464
<v Speaker 1>boats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes that could fly and corrupt </v>

132
00:06:48.851 --> 00:06:49.684
<v Speaker 1>officials that you'd like to empty their</v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenals to sell the weapons on the </v>

133
00:06:51.761 --> 00:06:53.500
<v Speaker 1>black market who's in?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:56.110
<v Speaker 1>he wants it to change that and today </v>
<v Speaker 1>things they are very,</v>

135
00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since Putin reached power and especially</v>

136
00:07:02.781 --> 00:07:03.614
<v Speaker 1>since 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin has made it a priority to update </v>

137
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:07.940
<v Speaker 1>to the army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the last few years they have spent</v>

138
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.833
<v Speaker 1>tens of billions of dollars turning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>old Russian army into a modern military </v>

139
00:07:12.411 --> 00:07:13.244
<v Speaker 1>force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even more important than that is </v>

140
00:07:14.451 --> 00:07:17.970
<v Speaker 1>that they have made serious upgrades to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that fire firepower plains missiles,</v>

141
00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:20.030
<v Speaker 1>ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are all being updated.</v>

142
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.293
<v Speaker 1>Look closely in 2015 alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the figures of the Russian </v>

143
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.613
<v Speaker 1>Ministry of Defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the army got four ships for submarines </v>

144
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.590
<v Speaker 1>50 to support ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27 aircrafts and 45 artillery units,</v>

145
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:38.340
<v Speaker 1>but not everyone shares this opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

146
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:39.203
<v Speaker 1>one former US general told me that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single US super aircraft carrier group </v>

147
00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:42.923
<v Speaker 1>could obliterate the entire Russian navy</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the equipment is so dated and </v>

148
00:07:45.391 --> 00:07:46.224
<v Speaker 1>technologically obsolete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Azeem O'brian research professor at the </v>

149
00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:51.300
<v Speaker 1>United States Army War College.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Regardless,</v>

150
00:07:51.301 --> 00:07:52.134
<v Speaker 1>we could save the Russian army has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become a key part of Moscow's </v>

151
00:07:54.181 --> 00:07:55.014
<v Speaker 1>international politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is not just this political </v>

152
00:07:56.701 --> 00:07:59.460
<v Speaker 1>influence in other countries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>international conflicts,</v>

153
00:07:59.490 --> 00:08:03.360
<v Speaker 1>but also the renewed capacity of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian arms industry.</v>

154
00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:05.520
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not forget about all those nukes they</v>

155
00:08:05.521 --> 00:08:10.521
<v Speaker 1>have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a lot of nukes,</v>

156
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:13.720
<v Speaker 1>feet</v>

157
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.380
<v Speaker 2>of clay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

158
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:19.020
<v Speaker 1>if we can see the Russian army as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>asset for Pearson,</v>

159
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:22.110
<v Speaker 1>the wrecked Russian economy is certainly</v>
<v Speaker 1>his main weakness.</v>

160
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:22.973
<v Speaker 1>Russia is basically a producer and an </v>
<v Speaker 1>exporter of natural resources and </v>

161
00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.950
<v Speaker 1>Russia's economy isn't nowhere even </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to China's.</v>

162
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:29.843
<v Speaker 1>In the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia has been unable to diversify or </v>

163
00:08:32.461 --> 00:08:34.680
<v Speaker 1>develop a complex and productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

164
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:38.200
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia is more and more dependent on its</v>

165
00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.140
<v Speaker 1>natural resources every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

166
00:08:40.141 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>they are so dependent on them that </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything is great.</v>

167
00:08:42.721 --> 00:08:43.554
<v Speaker 1>When the prices are high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when they are not a crisis kicks </v>

168
00:08:45.991 --> 00:08:46.824
<v Speaker 1>off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are Barack Obama's words from his </v>

169
00:08:48.241 --> 00:08:50.280
<v Speaker 1>final press conference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As presidents,</v>

170
00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:53.760
<v Speaker 1>the Russians can't change us or </v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly weaken us.</v>

171
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>They're a smaller country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weaker country.</v>

172
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>Their economy doesn't produce anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>that anybody wants to buy except oil and</v>

173
00:08:59.971 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>gas and arms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't innovate.</v>

174
00:09:01.681 --> 00:09:02.514
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama as the oligarchy states and</v>
<v Speaker 1>those Putin is creators has a lot to do </v>

175
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:06.300
<v Speaker 1>with it.</v>

176
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:09.840
<v Speaker 1>The state has simply taken a more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more important role in the economy since</v>

177
00:09:09.841 --> 00:09:10.674
<v Speaker 1>2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was then 35 percent and today it is </v>

178
00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:14.003
<v Speaker 1>70 percent and let us not forget that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this process has been led by Putin's </v>

179
00:09:17.251 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>buddies and sure in this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

180
00:09:19.351 --> 00:09:20.184
<v Speaker 1>of course corruption spreads and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition disappears and with those </v>

181
00:09:22.771 --> 00:09:23.604
<v Speaker 1>things gone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's not really much of an incentive </v>

182
00:09:25.111 --> 00:09:25.944
<v Speaker 1>for them to do things right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's why the future of Russia's </v>

183
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:28.674
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's looking pretty bleak once some </v>

184
00:09:30.121 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>proof of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in 2016,</v>

185
00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:35.610
<v Speaker 1>more than 400,000 people left the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and many of these people,</v>

186
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:38.060
<v Speaker 1>whether young and educated anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian model,</v>

187
00:09:38.061 --> 00:09:38.894
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't seem capable of </v>
<v Speaker 1>encouraging growth and development in </v>

188
00:09:41.191 --> 00:09:44.370
<v Speaker 1>the country and besides think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a weakness itself.</v>

189
00:09:44.430 --> 00:09:48.060
<v Speaker 1>A poor economy means less influence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less potential to develop the military.</v>

190
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 1>And finally the third branch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's political power.</v>

191
00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:51.473
<v Speaker 1>We could discuss further the moves with </v>
<v Speaker 1>China or the Russian strategy in the </v>

192
00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:55.463
<v Speaker 1>Middle East where Moscow is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take influence from their less than the </v>

193
00:09:57.900 --> 00:09:58.733
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I think we should leave that for a </v>

194
00:10:00.001 --> 00:10:01.980
<v Speaker 1>future video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we wonder,</v>

195
00:10:01.981 --> 00:10:04.620
<v Speaker 1>what's your opinion?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about Vladimir Putin?</v>

196
00:10:04.621 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree with us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disagree?</v>

197
00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave your answers in the comments below</v>
