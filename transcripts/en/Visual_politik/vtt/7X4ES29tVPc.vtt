<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:09.883
<v Speaker 2>how many people?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan is still pretty mysterious and </v>

3
00:00:11.961 --> 00:00:12.794
<v Speaker 2>that's not only because it's a country </v>
<v Speaker 2>where people push that dog's arounds in </v>

4
00:00:15.741 --> 00:00:19.310
<v Speaker 2>prams and drink coffee in places full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>cats mode at all.</v>

5
00:00:19.311 --> 00:00:20.144
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just like being an overpopulated area </v>

6
00:00:23.511 --> 00:00:24.344
<v Speaker 2>with scarce natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan is one of the richest and most </v>

7
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:27.644
<v Speaker 2>developed countries in the world with </v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest average life expectancy on </v>

8
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:31.630
<v Speaker 2>the planet.</v>

9
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:32.463
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

10
00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.400
<v Speaker 2>so,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's no wonder that it tends to amaze us</v>

11
00:00:37.401 --> 00:00:38.720
<v Speaker 2>in the west,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but hold on.</v>

12
00:00:38.721 --> 00:00:39.554
<v Speaker 2>Amendments here because Japan wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>always the economic powerhouse that we </v>

13
00:00:42.381 --> 00:00:43.820
<v Speaker 2>know today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

14
00:00:43.821 --> 00:00:46.190
<v Speaker 2>it was quite the opposite until the mid </v>
<v Speaker 2>19th century.</v>

15
00:00:46.191 --> 00:00:47.024
<v Speaker 2>This country operated under a political </v>
<v Speaker 2>and economic system that was very </v>

16
00:00:50.061 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 2>similar to medieval a Europe's at that </v>
<v Speaker 2>time,</v>

17
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.663
<v Speaker 2>Japan was a poor and backward territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>closed off to the world with a strongly </v>

18
00:00:57.381 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 2>stratified society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the question is,</v>

19
00:00:59.541 --> 00:01:00.374
<v Speaker 2>how did the great change occur?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did Japan managed to her eyes up </v>

20
00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:08.300
<v Speaker 2>from its status as a poor rural country </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that of a great industrial power?</v>

21
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.253
<v Speaker 2>Was it all because of the influence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>help of the United States after the </v>

22
00:01:14.961 --> 00:01:15.794
<v Speaker 2>Second World War?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was it the result of a meticulously </v>

23
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:19.790
<v Speaker 2>designed the plan by the government?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

24
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 2>we can say that this entire process </v>
<v Speaker 2>involved to major stages.</v>

25
00:01:24.111 --> 00:01:26.150
<v Speaker 2>We'll talk about the first one in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

26
00:01:26.151 --> 00:01:30.860
<v Speaker 2>which began 150 years ago with these so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Meiji Restoration and yes,</v>

27
00:01:30.861 --> 00:01:31.694
<v Speaker 2>this did happen 150 years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>2018 is the hundred 50th anniversary of </v>

28
00:01:35.391 --> 00:01:36.800
<v Speaker 2>this happening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second stage,</v>

29
00:01:36.801 --> 00:01:38.600
<v Speaker 2>which we're going to talk about in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>future video,</v>

30
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:39.434
<v Speaker 2>and don't forget to subscribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you get that began at the end of the </v>

31
00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:44.420
<v Speaker 2>Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But having said this,</v>

32
00:01:44.421 --> 00:01:46.760
<v Speaker 2>let's stop with the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So here we go.</v>

33
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.223
<v Speaker 2>Meiji restoration 150 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and did </v>

34
00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.164
<v Speaker 2>the dominance of the Tokugawa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clan of it for more than 250 years in </v>

35
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 2>1603 and virtually supplanters of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>emperor's power,</v>

36
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.820
<v Speaker 2>turning them into the great lords of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>

37
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.343
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a long period during</v>
<v Speaker 2>which Japan remained isolated from all </v>

38
00:02:18.011 --> 00:02:18.844
<v Speaker 2>contact with the outside world and well </v>
<v Speaker 2>many western countries were throwing </v>

39
00:02:22.061 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 2>themselves into the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>

40
00:02:24.041 --> 00:02:26.920
<v Speaker 2>This isolation calls Japan to retain </v>
<v Speaker 2>social,</v>

41
00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.843
<v Speaker 2>political,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and economic structures that were more </v>

42
00:02:29.681 --> 00:02:32.620
<v Speaker 2>similar to the Middle Ages than modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>times.</v>

43
00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:34.750
<v Speaker 2>At that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan was a feudal society,</v>

44
00:02:34.751 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 2>dominated by warlords.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zenned for no less than 14 centuries had</v>

45
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 2>behaved like a kind of vassal state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese emba.</v>

46
00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.973
<v Speaker 2>All of this very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very different from the Japan that we </v>

47
00:02:46.661 --> 00:02:47.494
<v Speaker 2>know today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a country that </v>

48
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:49.654
<v Speaker 2>prohibited the use of its ports by </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreigners to stop their interference </v>

49
00:02:52.601 --> 00:02:55.510
<v Speaker 2>from contaminating the local culture and</v>
<v Speaker 2>traditions.</v>

50
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.463
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that also ended any trade and any </v>

51
00:02:58.031 --> 00:03:02.230
<v Speaker 2>possibility that it's political estates </v>
<v Speaker 2>would move to the beat of the Times.</v>

52
00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:03.153
<v Speaker 2>This was the situation until in 1853 a </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern u s fleet arrived in Tokyo Bay </v>

53
00:03:07.871 --> 00:03:11.940
<v Speaker 2>with a mission and a message.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Either the Japanese authorities excepted</v>

54
00:03:11.941 --> 00:03:16.941
<v Speaker 2>ends allow trade or that half to face </v>
<v Speaker 2>the consequences steamboats the hawks of</v>

55
00:03:24.561 --> 00:03:25.394
<v Speaker 2>the Pacific break their rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Four boats are enough to make us lose </v>

56
00:03:28.731 --> 00:03:29.450
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At night.</v>

57
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.283
<v Speaker 2>Japanese poem referring to the American </v>
<v Speaker 2>ships that arrived in the country in </v>

58
00:03:33.681 --> 00:03:38.681
<v Speaker 2>1853 obviously the fall less developed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese institutions could do little in</v>

59
00:03:39.531 --> 00:03:42.440
<v Speaker 2>the face of a modern technologically </v>
<v Speaker 2>advanced war fleet,</v>

60
00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.710
<v Speaker 2>so they had no choice but to accept and </v>
<v Speaker 2>it</v>

61
00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.540
<v Speaker 2>that was the beginning of the end of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tokugawa regime within a few years,</v>

62
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:53.374
<v Speaker 2>disgusted by the morven palpable loss of</v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty by the humiliation of </v>

63
00:03:56.801 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 2>feeling like a poor and and capable of </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

64
00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:01.540
<v Speaker 2>and having seen the decline of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese Empire,</v>

65
00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:02.433
<v Speaker 2>the Samurai Samurai,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way were much more modern </v>

66
00:04:04.601 --> 00:04:05.434
<v Speaker 2>than those we usually see in movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>took control and they restored imperial </v>

67
00:04:08.891 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the well known Meiji</v>

68
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.963
<v Speaker 2>Restoration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which against all odds launched Japan </v>

69
00:04:14.021 --> 00:04:19.021
<v Speaker 2>into the arms of a broad reform program </v>
<v Speaker 2>that changed practically every field off</v>

70
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.650
<v Speaker 2>to rule given the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>technological,</v>

71
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:26.710
<v Speaker 2>economic and military superiority of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>western powers.</v>

72
00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:27.613
<v Speaker 2>The best way to preserve Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>sovereignty equals to take notes and to </v>

73
00:04:30.251 --> 00:04:35.220
<v Speaker 2>promote the country's development.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I do.</v>

74
00:04:35.221 --> 00:04:36.054
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While they did just that within a few </v>

75
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.493
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not even the Japanese themselves could </v>

76
00:04:39.941 --> 00:04:40.774
<v Speaker 2>recognize Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the steps of the country </v>

77
00:04:42.461 --> 00:04:46.270
<v Speaker 2>followed to jump from the feudal age </v>
<v Speaker 2>right into the modern world.</v>

78
00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.133
<v Speaker 2>So listen up</v>

79
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.413
<v Speaker 2>at the political level,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of the old institutions were </v>

80
00:04:52.091 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 2>terminated and an independent judiciary </v>
<v Speaker 2>power,</v>

81
00:04:54.641 --> 00:04:55.474
<v Speaker 2>a bicameral legislature and a modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>prefectural system were introduced to </v>

82
00:04:59.231 --> 00:05:01.150
<v Speaker 2>govern the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>various regions.</v>

83
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.720
<v Speaker 2>The old taxes on the sale of rice were </v>
<v Speaker 2>replaced by a lamb's tax,</v>

84
00:05:04.721 --> 00:05:07.600
<v Speaker 2>which had two huge advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

85
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:08.434
<v Speaker 2>it facilitated the calculation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>revenues the government obtained each </v>

86
00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.240
<v Speaker 2>year after all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nick amounts of lands doesn't change,</v>

87
00:05:13.241 --> 00:05:15.340
<v Speaker 2>but the rice production does change </v>
<v Speaker 2>every year,</v>

88
00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.140
<v Speaker 2>which allowed the government to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

89
00:05:17.141 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 2>design finance and build several </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure projects.</v>

90
00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:21.633
<v Speaker 2>This then help the time and lands </v>
<v Speaker 2>ownership with precision establishing a </v>

91
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 2>modern property rights system for it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

92
00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:30.553
<v Speaker 2>well that was not all being aware of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>importance of knowledge and new </v>

93
00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:37.410
<v Speaker 2>technologies in 1872 just four years </v>
<v Speaker 2>after the Meiji Restoration,</v>

94
00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:38.273
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese government to establish a </v>
<v Speaker 2>universal primary education system </v>

95
00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.433
<v Speaker 2>because within a few years the Tokyo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute of Technology and the </v>

96
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.883
<v Speaker 2>University of Tokyo were create it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course in addition to everything </v>

97
00:05:49.411 --> 00:05:51.960
<v Speaker 2>we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan is openness was also encouraged.</v>

98
00:05:51.961 --> 00:05:52.794
<v Speaker 2>Foreign experts and professionals we </v>
<v Speaker 2>have attracted to transmit their </v>

99
00:05:55.021 --> 00:05:55.854
<v Speaker 2>knowledge and many Japanese students </v>
<v Speaker 2>were scholarships to study both in </v>

100
00:05:58.970 --> 00:05:59.803
<v Speaker 2>Europe and in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The results of this whole process was </v>

101
00:06:06.841 --> 00:06:07.674
<v Speaker 2>that in just 50 years Japan managed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go through it's own industrial </v>

102
00:06:11.431 --> 00:06:12.264
<v Speaker 2>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's one third of the time it took </v>

103
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.253
<v Speaker 2>Europe</v>

104
00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.923
<v Speaker 2>that way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the following decades Japan </v>

105
00:06:19.101 --> 00:06:19.934
<v Speaker 2>continued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's take off process and completely </v>

106
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:22.754
<v Speaker 2>changed and that's also when it began </v>
<v Speaker 2>extending its influenced up neighboring </v>

107
00:06:25.641 --> 00:06:27.380
<v Speaker 2>countries like Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

108
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.273
<v Speaker 2>Russia and Taiwan in 1902 cause they </v>
<v Speaker 2>also signed a friendship agreement with </v>

109
00:06:31.101 --> 00:06:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Great Britain and agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this not only boosted its industry,</v>

110
00:06:34.371 --> 00:06:35.204
<v Speaker 2>but when World War One arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it enabled Japan to become an important </v>

111
00:06:37.641 --> 00:06:39.800
<v Speaker 2>supplier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>further boosting its economy.</v>

112
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:40.693
<v Speaker 2>In these years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many Japanese entrepreneurs became </v>

113
00:06:42.621 --> 00:06:47.520
<v Speaker 2>million ads for one reason or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the ends,</v>

114
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:51.160
<v Speaker 2>when countries boost their trade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every party usually benefits.</v>

115
00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:51.821
<v Speaker 2>Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>

116
00:06:51.821 --> 00:06:53.500
<v Speaker 2>Take note here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but folks,</v>

117
00:06:53.501 --> 00:06:54.334
<v Speaker 2>that's how we got to the year 1926 the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year when the darkest time in Japan </v>

118
00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:00.423
<v Speaker 2>began.</v>

119
00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.450
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>

120
00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:11.450
<v Speaker 2>War Economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1926 the,</v>

121
00:07:11.611 --> 00:07:12.444
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's Emperor Hirohito ascended the </v>

122
00:07:13.651 --> 00:07:18.651
<v Speaker 2>throne where he remained all the way </v>
<v Speaker 2>until 1989 and from that exact moment in</v>

123
00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:23.430
<v Speaker 2>the 1920s Japan began to deepen its most</v>
<v Speaker 2>warlike profile.</v>

124
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:27.810
<v Speaker 2>In 1931 Japanese troops occupied the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese province of Manchuria where they</v>

125
00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:30.510
<v Speaker 2>not only committed and enormous number </v>
<v Speaker 2>of crimes,</v>

126
00:07:30.511 --> 00:07:31.344
<v Speaker 2>but in occupying the province,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also triggered the tense relations </v>

127
00:07:34.081 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 2>between Japan and most of the western </v>
<v Speaker 2>powers.</v>

128
00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 2>And that's not once everything he said </v>
<v Speaker 2>came to power,</v>

129
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.523
<v Speaker 2>the government again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to boost the war industry to such an </v>

130
00:07:44.331 --> 00:07:45.164
<v Speaker 2>extent that in 1931 while the trips </v>
<v Speaker 2>invaded Manchuria Japanese government </v>

131
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.030
<v Speaker 2>authorized and encouraged the creation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of cartels among large companies,</v>

132
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.923
<v Speaker 2>especially among the heavy industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to say the industry related to </v>

133
00:07:57.231 --> 00:07:59.990
<v Speaker 2>steel boat machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>truck construction,</v>

134
00:08:00.260 --> 00:08:01.093
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way the government is good urge </v>

135
00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:03.194
<v Speaker 2>launch companies do agreeing to increase</v>
<v Speaker 2>production as quickly as possible if </v>

136
00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:08.090
<v Speaker 2>while limiting the entry of new </v>
<v Speaker 2>competitors,</v>

137
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.210
<v Speaker 2>and that's not all in the following </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

138
00:08:13.211 --> 00:08:14.044
<v Speaker 2>The government also injected a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>capital into these companies until it </v>

139
00:08:16.991 --> 00:08:20.410
<v Speaker 2>became co owner of several of them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the while our military spending,</v>

140
00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.440
<v Speaker 2>it just wouldn't stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

141
00:08:25.471 --> 00:08:28.350
<v Speaker 2>this massive amounts of government </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervention in the economy,</v>

142
00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.243
<v Speaker 2>they had had consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's more businesses were ravaged and </v>

143
00:08:31.411 --> 00:08:35.940
<v Speaker 2>almost every civilian industry closed </v>
<v Speaker 2>long before the U s bombing during World</v>

144
00:08:35.941 --> 00:08:36.774
<v Speaker 2>War Two the consequences of this war </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy didn't only lead to a more </v>

145
00:08:39.631 --> 00:08:42.600
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian governments since a </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater military influence,</v>

146
00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:43.434
<v Speaker 2>which ultimately ended up in a war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also in the general impoverishment </v>

147
00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:47.633
<v Speaker 2>of the Japanese.</v>

148
00:08:47.930 --> 00:08:48.763
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

149
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:53.091
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

150
00:08:53.091 --> 00:08:53.924
<v Speaker 2>military material had to be produced of </v>
<v Speaker 2>goods that would improve people's lives </v>

151
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:59.100
<v Speaker 2>on a day to day basis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More rifles,</v>

152
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:02.990
<v Speaker 2>less soon machines ended up with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country being much poorer in the end.</v>

153
00:09:08.290 --> 00:09:10.270
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not strange at all.</v>

154
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:11.133
<v Speaker 2>History teaches us that militaristic </v>
<v Speaker 2>policies tend to be very efficient and </v>

155
00:09:14.621 --> 00:09:16.220
<v Speaker 2>boost the power of the elite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

156
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:20.500
<v Speaker 2>impoverishing the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that as we all know,</v>

157
00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:23.740
<v Speaker 2>at the end of World War Two Japan wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>only a defeated country,</v>

158
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:24.603
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was shattered and the Japanese had </v>

159
00:09:27.191 --> 00:09:30.060
<v Speaker 2>gone back decades in terms of their </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard.</v>

160
00:09:30.061 --> 00:09:30.260
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:30.260 --> 00:09:31.093
<v Speaker 1>Living</v>

162
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:33.500
<v Speaker 2>all this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

163
00:09:33.501 --> 00:09:34.334
<v Speaker 2>in addition to the tragedy of having </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost more than 3 million lives during </v>

164
00:09:37.401 --> 00:09:38.234
<v Speaker 2>the conflicts,</v>

165
00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.210

<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

167
00:09:42.221 --> 00:09:43.054

<v Speaker 2>great power within just a few years?</v>
