<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.330
<v Speaker 2>Any of you have asked us for a video </v>
<v Speaker 2>explaining what communism is all about,</v>

3
00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:15.020
<v Speaker 2>so well paired is if you have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>following this channel for a while,</v>

4
00:00:15.021 --> 00:00:15.854
<v Speaker 2>you'll probably know that when not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly on the communist side of the </v>

5
00:00:19.041 --> 00:00:19.874
<v Speaker 2>spectrum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before having an opinion about </v>

6
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.184
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's important to be informed about </v>

7
00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:24.111
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

8
00:00:24.111 --> 00:00:24.944
<v Speaker 2>at the end of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to share some takeaways </v>

9
00:00:26.481 --> 00:00:29.150
<v Speaker 2>about mocks that just might surprise </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

10
00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 2>The Internet is full of trolls who will </v>
<v Speaker 2>either sing marks his praises or hate on</v>

11
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:36.010
<v Speaker 2>him without ever having read it.</v>

12
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.910
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

13
00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:40.473
<v Speaker 2>it's why people ends up in leaving quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of stereotypes about communism </v>

14
00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.070
<v Speaker 2>that's simply on true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

15
00:00:45.071 --> 00:00:45.904
<v Speaker 2>before I saw it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I will say that this is a summary of </v>

16
00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:52.000
<v Speaker 2>Friedrich Engels and column boxes ideas </v>
<v Speaker 2>on communism only.</v>

17
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.073
<v Speaker 2>We've only got 10 minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's going to be impossible to cover </v>

18
00:00:54.941 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 2>authors who came after or the politics </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Soviet Union.</v>

19
00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 2>But with that out of the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's get started.</v>

20
00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.590
<v Speaker 1>The first thing</v>

21
00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:05.423
<v Speaker 2>you need to know that may surprise you </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that mark's was eight materialist of </v>

22
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:10.483
<v Speaker 2>thinker.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that he thinks the main </v>

23
00:01:12.151 --> 00:01:15.600
<v Speaker 2>driver of social change is material </v>
<v Speaker 2>goods.</v>

24
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.673
<v Speaker 2>The foundation of Marxism is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>determine which goods have more value </v>

25
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.204
<v Speaker 2>than other goods,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it do be warns here that we are </v>

26
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 2>talking about value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not a balanced price.</v>

27
00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.060
<v Speaker 2>Price can be influenced by other things </v>
<v Speaker 2>such as taxes or monopolies.</v>

28
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.393
<v Speaker 2>For Marx,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the value with the good is measured by </v>

29
00:01:36.171 --> 00:01:39.950
<v Speaker 2>the work needed to manufacture it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So for an example,</v>

30
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.843
<v Speaker 2>how much is a chair with it would be the</v>
<v Speaker 2>sum of the carbons does working hours </v>

31
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:44.744
<v Speaker 2>who put the chat together as well as the</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of the working hours of the </v>

32
00:01:46.941 --> 00:01:47.774
<v Speaker 2>lumberjack.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You cut down the tree as well as the </v>

33
00:01:49.311 --> 00:01:50.144
<v Speaker 2>some of the working hours of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>blacksmith who made the nails that went </v>

34
00:01:52.671 --> 00:01:56.840
<v Speaker 2>into the chair and this goes on man's </v>
<v Speaker 2>almonds on in summary,</v>

35
00:01:56.841 --> 00:02:01.670
<v Speaker 2>it's all the work of all the people who </v>
<v Speaker 2>went in to making it as the chair.</v>

36
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.773
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget this because it's very </v>
<v Speaker 2>important in understanding the idea of </v>

37
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:07.124
<v Speaker 2>capitalist exploitation and though this </v>
<v Speaker 2>has nothing to do with working hours or </v>

38
00:02:11.061 --> 00:02:11.960
<v Speaker 2>worker's condition</v>

39
00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

40
00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.990
<v Speaker 2>it's the wealthier is this some under </v>
<v Speaker 2>mocks?</v>

41
00:02:18.991 --> 00:02:21.930
<v Speaker 2>The welfare is the sum of all these </v>
<v Speaker 2>people's work,</v>

42
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.760
<v Speaker 2>right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but these people,</v>

43
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.390
<v Speaker 2>they only get a share of the wealth of </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they create.</v>

44
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.580
<v Speaker 2>The rest is profit for the factories.</v>

45
00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.840
<v Speaker 1>This one</v>

46
00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.673
<v Speaker 2>needs that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If these people are working eight hours </v>

47
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:36.890
<v Speaker 2>a day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're only getting a fraction of that.</v>

48
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.290
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the first three or four hours </v>
<v Speaker 2>work.</v>

49
00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:40.363
<v Speaker 2>The other part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the part that the businessmen receives </v>

50
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.760
<v Speaker 2>is cold substance.</v>

51
00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.110
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their produce</v>

52
00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.943
<v Speaker 2>value.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He's there for the exact expression of </v>

53
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:51.394
<v Speaker 2>the expectation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the glory of the working force by the </v>

54
00:02:53.351 --> 00:02:54.184
<v Speaker 2>Capitol or the worker by the capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So something you might be wondering how </v>

55
00:02:58.211 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 2>is it possible the business owner to </v>
<v Speaker 2>exploit the workers so easily?</v>

56
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Why on the workers getting the whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>value that they're generating?</v>

57
00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:06.663
<v Speaker 2>The answer is because they don't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the tools required to take the raw </v>

58
00:03:08.891 --> 00:03:11.310
<v Speaker 2>materials and turn them into a finished </v>
<v Speaker 2>product,</v>

59
00:03:11.311 --> 00:03:12.460
<v Speaker 2>a factory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a workshop,</v>

60
00:03:12.461 --> 00:03:14.000
<v Speaker 2>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Marty.</v>

61
00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.001
<v Speaker 2>An economic jargon is called the means </v>
<v Speaker 2>of production or capital means.</v>

62
00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.343
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is why the person who owns these </v>

63
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 2>things is often called a capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

64
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>despite what some people think marks has</v>
<v Speaker 2>no problem.</v>

65
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.150
<v Speaker 2>If you want to own a fancy car or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>really expensive mobile phone,</v>

66
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.133
<v Speaker 2>he just has a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to own the means of </v>

67
00:03:34.361 --> 00:03:36.940
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this means having a company.</v>

68
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.370
<v Speaker 2>But why is this a problem?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

69
00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:40.263
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look.</v>

70
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

71
00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.490
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] of capitalism</v>

72
00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.150
<v Speaker 2>now mocks divide society into two </v>
<v Speaker 2>classes.</v>

73
00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.200
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand you have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>capitalists,</v>

74
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.053
<v Speaker 2>the bourgeoisie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on the other hand you have the one </v>

75
00:03:52.941 --> 00:03:53.774
<v Speaker 2>that gives the pro to terry at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bourgeoisie own the production process </v>

76
00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.073
<v Speaker 2>and they exploit the workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The workers are the ones who were doing </v>

77
00:04:01.021 --> 00:04:01.854
<v Speaker 2>the work and making the value,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they only get the bread crumbs from </v>

78
00:04:04.201 --> 00:04:05.910
<v Speaker 2>the bourgeoisie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Therefore,</v>

79
00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:10.230
<v Speaker 2>we have a confrontation or why you might</v>
<v Speaker 2>have heard of a class struggle,</v>

80
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 2>and this is what Marx defines as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>original sin of a market economy.</v>

81
00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.473
<v Speaker 2>And as you can clearly see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has nothing to do with poverty or </v>

82
00:04:17.791 --> 00:04:19.080
<v Speaker 2>inequality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

83
00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.923
<v Speaker 2>in Nordic countries where the difference</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the wealthy and the poor is not </v>

84
00:04:22.801 --> 00:04:23.634
<v Speaker 2>so great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is still capitalist exploitation </v>

85
00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.270
<v Speaker 2>as long as the means of production is in</v>
<v Speaker 2>private hands.</v>

86
00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.670
<v Speaker 2>This is why [inaudible] doesn't just </v>
<v Speaker 2>focus.</v>

87
00:04:32.671 --> 00:04:36.000
<v Speaker 2>His criticism was on capitalists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also on Social Democrat</v>

88
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.100
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

89
00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:39.753
<v Speaker 3>that'd be less systematic,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but yet more practical of socialism </v>

90
00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:47.110
<v Speaker 3>dries to freeze any revolutionary wheel </v>
<v Speaker 3>from the working class.</v>

91
00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.950
<v Speaker 3>Claiming it is not a political reform </v>
<v Speaker 3>that will give them benefit,</v>

92
00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.640
<v Speaker 3>but only the modification of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>material life conditions.</v>

93
00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:55.683
<v Speaker 2>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the working relations of capitalism are </v>

94
00:04:57.461 --> 00:05:00.400
<v Speaker 2>based on one group living off another </v>
<v Speaker 2>group.</v>

95
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.360
<v Speaker 2>This is what Marx calls the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure of capitalism.</v>

96
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.220
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to make this work,</v>

97
00:05:06.221 --> 00:05:07.054
<v Speaker 2>the bourgeoisie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you need some sort of secret weapon to </v>

98
00:05:08.801 --> 00:05:11.800
<v Speaker 2>keep that supremacy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why they create a government.</v>

99
00:05:11.801 --> 00:05:14.500
<v Speaker 2>They create laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they create even religion.</v>

100
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.560
<v Speaker 2>This is what Marx calls at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>superstructure,</v>

101
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:18.513
<v Speaker 2>also known as a cultural hegemony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what is Marxists solution to end all </v>

102
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:23.164
<v Speaker 2>of this injustice?</v>

103
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:26.400
<v Speaker 3>Girls Revolution.</v>

104
00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.950
<v Speaker 2>Further Marx believes that capitalism is</v>
<v Speaker 2>unsuspecting</v>

105
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.690
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

106
00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.973
<v Speaker 3>claim that their goals can be only </v>
<v Speaker 3>achieved by the violin over throat of </v>

107
00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:39.980
<v Speaker 3>every existence,</v>
<v Speaker 3>social order.</v>

108
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.053
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he even predicts that the first </v>

109
00:05:41.901 --> 00:05:45.950
<v Speaker 2>countries to fall will be the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial nations specific green.</v>

110
00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.930
<v Speaker 2>He predicts the fall of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kingdom,</v>

111
00:05:47.931 --> 00:05:50.320
<v Speaker 2>which was the leading industrial nation </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Islam,</v>

112
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:51.313
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

113
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.840
<v Speaker 3>He's 14 their own destruction and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>own undertaker.</v>

114
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.100
<v Speaker 3>The proletariat</v>

115
00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 2>boss here is the most ironic part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

116
00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:02.773
<v Speaker 2>If you look at all the facts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the countries that have had marxists </v>

117
00:06:04.811 --> 00:06:05.644
<v Speaker 2>revolutions are things that never had an</v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial revolution and never had a </v>

118
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.723
<v Speaker 2>bourgeoisie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are countries like Russia or </v>

119
00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.940
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which never had a capitalist system,</v>

120
00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.923
<v Speaker 2>at least how mark's defined it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those countries with advanced </v>

121
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 2>capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it never even had a revolution.</v>

122
00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 2>Maybe the only exceptions would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hungary and Czechoslovakia,</v>

123
00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.520
<v Speaker 2>but these were cases where communism </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't come through a revolution,</v>

124
00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 2>but by the USA army invading those</v>

125
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:32.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:33.950
<v Speaker 2>key question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the boxes.</v>

127
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Philosophers wonder during the 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century is where is the revolution?</v>

128
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:41.050
<v Speaker 2>The marks promised us.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a question that many people have</v>

129
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:41.884
<v Speaker 2>tried to answer to philosophers that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>would specifically recommend reading on </v>

130
00:06:44.801 --> 00:06:48.160
<v Speaker 2>this topic are yoga and the harbor mass </v>
<v Speaker 2>and then turn to your grand scheme.</v>

131
00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:49.083
<v Speaker 2>They looked at human language as well as</v>
<v Speaker 2>how humans perceive reality to see why </v>

132
00:06:52.301 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>we haven't had this revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>

133
00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:55.623
<v Speaker 2>this research has even been useful in </v>
<v Speaker 2>possibly the least boxes thing you can </v>

134
00:06:58.901 --> 00:06:59.734
<v Speaker 2>imagine.</v>

135
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.220
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

136
00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:06.030
<v Speaker 2>that is definitely something we are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to address in this video,</v>

137
00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:09.150
<v Speaker 2>but we'll save it for a future video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you're interested in learning how box</v>

138
00:07:09.151 --> 00:07:11.400
<v Speaker 2>relates to marketing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do let us know in the comments below.</v>

139
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.940
<v Speaker 2>If you are interested in finding out </v>
<v Speaker 2>more about this topic now,</v>

140
00:07:14.941 --> 00:07:17.490
<v Speaker 2>then you can check out a book written on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the subjects,</v>

141
00:07:17.491 --> 00:07:21.900
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately it's only in Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is written by one of the hosts of</v>

142
00:07:21.901 --> 00:07:25.680
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish visual politic channel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Send your funds sacker but as I said,</v>

143
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:28.260
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely something we'll consider</v>
<v Speaker 2>addressing in a future video.</v>

144
00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:31.240

145
00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:32.923
<v Speaker 2>shed our opinion with you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what do you think of Marx's </v>

146
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:37.670
<v Speaker 2>theories?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that they're still relevant</v>

147
00:07:37.671 --> 00:07:40.760
<v Speaker 2>in the world we live in today?</v>
