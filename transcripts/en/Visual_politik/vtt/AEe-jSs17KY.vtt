1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.010
<v Speaker 1>Here's a quick question and by now you </v>
<v Speaker 1>know the rules,</v>

2
00:00:02.011 --> 00:00:02.844
<v Speaker 1>please don't google it or wikipedia it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>or whatever and the question is what do </v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.284
<v Speaker 1>you know about Armenia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you really know about this </v>

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:11.950
<v Speaker 1>remote country located in the caucus's </v>
<v Speaker 1>region out?</v>

5
00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>Because Armenia has some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting traits.</v>

6
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:15.564
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the first Christian country in </v>

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.383
<v Speaker 1>all of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a chess well power I didn't even </v>

8
00:00:20.641 --> 00:00:25.641
<v Speaker 1>has its own alphabet is another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you might not know about.</v>

9
00:00:32.461 --> 00:00:36.030
<v Speaker 1>This country inside of the country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not really sure how to say this,</v>

10
00:00:36.031 --> 00:00:38.410
<v Speaker 1>but essentially there's another country </v>
<v Speaker 1>in that.</v>

11
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.640
<v Speaker 1>This country is the self constituted </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic of odd sack,</v>

12
00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:45.560
<v Speaker 1>formerly known as an Al Gore Cara back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You owe that rights we're talking about,</v>

13
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:49.320
<v Speaker 1>it's a republic that isn't recognized by</v>
<v Speaker 1>any other country in the world but which</v>

14
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:50.154
<v Speaker 1>proclaimed its independence in 1991 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>has its own governments' parliaments </v>

15
00:00:53.851 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>constitution and even its own armed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

16
00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.110
<v Speaker 1>You'll see except for a passport with </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they can travel the world.</v>

17
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>They have everything of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this curious republic citizens,</v>

18
00:01:07.501 --> 00:01:08.334
<v Speaker 1>I'm sort of [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all have an Armenian passports </v>

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 1>because this country is a close ally of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenia.</v>

20
00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.693
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the Soviet period at this </v>

21
00:01:19.811 --> 00:01:23.080
<v Speaker 1>territory was an odd blast and </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous province of the asthma,</v>

22
00:01:23.081 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>Shani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet socialist republic,</v>

23
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.923
<v Speaker 1>but when the Soviet Union collapsed it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the government decided that it </v>

24
00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:29.134
<v Speaker 1>wanted to belong to Armenia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which led to a long four year water </v>

25
00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.210
<v Speaker 1>caused thousands of death.</v>

26
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

27
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:38.601
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting.</v>

28
00:01:38.601 --> 00:01:39.434
<v Speaker 1>Side note here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever noticed in history how </v>

29
00:01:40.791 --> 00:01:45.050
<v Speaker 1>many wars have happened simply over </v>
<v Speaker 1>eight tiny piece of lambs?</v>

30
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Let's stay on topic for today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe that's something we'll talk about </v>

31
00:01:48.291 --> 00:01:49.041
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

32
00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>most would agree that Armenia has </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely everything required to dazzle</v>

33
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:55.160
<v Speaker 1>a politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Addicts as of course,</v>

34
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:58.730
<v Speaker 1>everything required for us to talk about</v>
<v Speaker 1>it right here on visual politic.</v>

35
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>One comes re inside another one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent war in 2016 a huge diaspora,</v>

36
00:02:03.741 --> 00:02:04.574
<v Speaker 1>a democratic revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the potential to be a headache </v>

37
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:11.540
<v Speaker 1>for Mr Vladimir Putin himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen up.</v>

38
00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

39
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.083
<v Speaker 1>with no see access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a location surrounded by huge mountains </v>

40
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.910
<v Speaker 1>and less than 3 million inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe you are,</v>

41
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.330
<v Speaker 1>that we can call Armenia a pretty remote</v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

42
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:33.510
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If</v>

43
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.343
<v Speaker 1>we had to briefly describe this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would say that it's not far off from </v>

44
00:02:36.661 --> 00:02:40.170
<v Speaker 1>the typical Hollywood portrayal of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>former Soviet republic.</v>

45
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.250
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to like Hollywood.</v>

46
00:02:41.251 --> 00:02:42.084
<v Speaker 1>They don't have a rebel military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they certainly don't have a desire </v>

47
00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:44.814
<v Speaker 1>to return to communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth is that this country has </v>

48
00:02:46.861 --> 00:02:48.450
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many problems.</v>

49
00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.083
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenia gained its independence in </v>

50
00:02:52.261 --> 00:02:55.500
<v Speaker 1>September of 1991 and today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27 years later,</v>

51
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.890
<v Speaker 1>unemployment surpasses 20% one in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>three citizens' lives in poverty.</v>

52
00:02:59.891 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 1>Public debt has multiplied by four in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last decade alone,</v>

53
00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.000
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure is falling apart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all of that,</v>

54
00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>they have a serious emigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

55
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:12.640
<v Speaker 1>you heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

56
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.670
<v Speaker 1>Emigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

57
00:03:15.671 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated that there are about 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million Armenians around the world,</v>

58
00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:22.900
<v Speaker 1>but only 3 million of them actually live</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Armenia.</v>

59
00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.763
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about one of the largest </v>

60
00:03:25.331 --> 00:03:30.331
<v Speaker 1>diasporas in the entire world and only </v>
<v Speaker 1>one out of every five Armenians lives in</v>

61
00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Armenia itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>

62
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't astonishing enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year on average,</v>

63
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:42.811
<v Speaker 1>40,000 Armenians leave the country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>in many cases they simply never return.</v>

64
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:43.773
<v Speaker 1>Worst of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things do not seem to be improving jack </v>

65
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.190
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

66
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.740
<v Speaker 1>the evolution of foreign investments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent years,</v>

67
00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.340
<v Speaker 1>but at this point you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>

68
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are things going quite so badly?</v>

69
00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>div you at one of the reasons is </v>

70
00:04:05.681 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>certainly corruption ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The huge amounts of power that oligarchs</v>

71
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 1>in the country possess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You See,</v>

72
00:04:14.071 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>in the last 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Armenian party,</v>

73
00:04:17.461 --> 00:04:19.860
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theoretically sends a rise in pro market</v>

74
00:04:19.861 --> 00:04:20.694
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's really just a huge club of </v>

75
00:04:21.781 --> 00:04:22.614
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has tons of the country's politics into </v>

76
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:29.301
<v Speaker 1>a network of interests and privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's put it another way.</v>

77
00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:33.064
<v Speaker 1>For two entire decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to do business in Armenia </v>

78
00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:36.993
<v Speaker 1>joining this party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was almost a mandatory step and if </v>

79
00:04:39.641 --> 00:04:42.790
<v Speaker 1>you were a foreign up dropping by wasn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bad idea or either.</v>

80
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.290
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just hold on a moment here,</v>

81
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:47.800
<v Speaker 1>because in April of 2018 Armenian says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

82
00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>enough is enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you know what they did?</v>

83
00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they held a revolution in the streets.</v>

84
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.853
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

85
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.263
<v Speaker 2>The revolution.</v>

86
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:05.873
<v Speaker 1>10 disastrous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has empowered after exhausting his </v>

87
00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>maximum number of mandates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president's seg socks,</v>

88
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 1>young tried to copy Putin's strategy and</v>
<v Speaker 1>get elected as prime minister</v>

89
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:20.563
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He proposed a reform that basically </v>

90
00:05:21.891 --> 00:05:24.830
<v Speaker 1>pasta president's main powers onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister.</v>

91
00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:25.693
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think it happens at this </v>

92
00:05:26.121 --> 00:05:26.954
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all we talking about a smart </v>

93
00:05:27.741 --> 00:05:31.850
<v Speaker 1>maneuver to stay in power or rape.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leighton's mockery to all Armenians.</v>

94
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the have you,</v>

95
00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:33.800
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was very,</v>

96
00:05:33.801 --> 00:05:35.570
<v Speaker 1>very clear to the people of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

97
00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.580
<v Speaker 1>The presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was laughing at them.</v>

98
00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:38.563
<v Speaker 1>He could rig the elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uses power at will and that's big </v>

99
00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:43.340
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs use the government to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

100
00:05:43.341 --> 00:05:44.174
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was too much off to 10 years of </v>

101
00:05:46.581 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 1>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>segs,</v>

102
00:05:47.541 --> 00:05:48.374
<v Speaker 1>terrible managements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was beyond the joke and the </v>

103
00:05:50.571 --> 00:05:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Armenians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did not accept it.</v>

104
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>The 13th Nicole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>passion young,</v>

105
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.353
<v Speaker 1>a journalist and opposition deputy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Armenian parliaments could lead a </v>

106
00:06:09.041 --> 00:06:10.420
<v Speaker 1>protest mobilization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

107
00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 2>Si.</v>

108
00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.770
<v Speaker 1>But at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people join this protest,</v>

109
00:06:15.771 --> 00:06:18.060
<v Speaker 1>but in a matter of days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things changed.</v>

110
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.923
<v Speaker 1>A great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On April the 16th for large groups of </v>

111
00:06:21.031 --> 00:06:24.240
<v Speaker 1>students join the protest and four days </v>
<v Speaker 1>later on Friday,</v>

112
00:06:24.241 --> 00:06:27.540
<v Speaker 1>April the 20th the movement had already </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated and Yara van,</v>

113
00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:31.200
<v Speaker 1>the country's capital with tens of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people appearing.</v>

114
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.683
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

115
00:06:34.150 --> 00:06:34.983
<v Speaker 1>The government's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which up until then had seen the </v>

116
00:06:36.281 --> 00:06:40.090
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations is a small nuisance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>began to get rather nervous.</v>

117
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>What do you think they did at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>

118
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:43.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did what?</v>

119
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Tyron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

120
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.470
<v Speaker 1>they're rested the main leaders of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>completely peaceful demonstrations,</v>

121
00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.990
<v Speaker 1>including their leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicholas Passion Yan,</v>

122
00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.913
<v Speaker 1>they also announced that the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>would disperse the protests rallies by </v>

123
00:06:53.141 --> 00:06:55.060
<v Speaker 1>force and without any consideration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

124
00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.840
<v Speaker 1>At this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might think that,</v>

125
00:07:04.850 --> 00:07:06.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was the end of the movement,</v>

126
00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

127
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:08.091
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

128
00:07:08.091 --> 00:07:08.924
<v Speaker 1>just the opposite happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the point of no return from that </v>

129
00:07:11.451 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 200,000 people in a country.</v>

130
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:14.954
<v Speaker 1>A few of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>3 million inhabitants took to the </v>

131
00:07:16.401 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>capitol streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

132
00:07:17.811 --> 00:07:20.780
<v Speaker 1>It was paralyzed work centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>schools and universities.</v>

133
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.673
<v Speaker 1>They all closed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The police faced with such a massive </v>

134
00:07:35.241 --> 00:07:36.620
<v Speaker 1>concentration of people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:07:36.830 --> 00:07:37.663
<v Speaker 1>they decided to do absolutely nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of this encouraged more and more </v>

136
00:07:40.581 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 1>people to join in a completely peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>and really quite happy protest.</v>

137
00:07:44.780 --> 00:07:47.600
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenia citizens had stood up and said,</v>

138
00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>enough's enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The velvet revolution is underway.</v>

139
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.380
<v Speaker 1>And what was the results?</v>

140
00:07:53.670 --> 00:07:54.330
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

141
00:07:54.330 --> 00:07:55.163
<v Speaker 1>Pm on Monday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>April the 23rd just 10 days after the </v>

142
00:07:57.151 --> 00:08:00.090
<v Speaker 1>protests began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president announced his resignation.</v>

143
00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:01.360
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our passion,</v>

144
00:08:01.361 --> 00:08:03.000
<v Speaker 1>Yann himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protests leader,</v>

145
00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:04.440
<v Speaker 1>a journalist too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

146
00:08:04.441 --> 00:08:05.274
<v Speaker 1>it's suffered an attempted attack and </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been in prisons for confronting the </v>

147
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:10.050
<v Speaker 1>governments had now been appointed prime</v>
<v Speaker 1>minister.</v>

148
00:08:10.110 --> 00:08:10.943
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a pretty crazy few weeks from </v>

149
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.360
<v Speaker 1>opponents of prisoner and from prison up</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the governments.</v>

150
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.253
<v Speaker 1>All in just a few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thing is why does society stabs up to </v>

151
00:08:24.661 --> 00:08:26.010
<v Speaker 1>demand freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

152
00:08:26.011 --> 00:08:28.110
<v Speaker 1>and justice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of hard to stop them.</v>

153
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.053
<v Speaker 1>I mean he now has a chance to change its</v>
<v Speaker 1>course and to face the oligarchs and </v>

154
00:08:32.100 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 1>ends the widespread corruption that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been consuming the country.</v>

155
00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:36.720
<v Speaker 2>We have</v>

156
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:41.100
<v Speaker 3>a new Armenia now where each investment </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be protected and no investment will</v>

157
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:43.590
<v Speaker 3>be threatened any longer and he called </v>
<v Speaker 3>Pacinian.</v>

158
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 3>Tara for group is one of the largest </v>
<v Speaker 3>companies in the sugar trade,</v>

159
00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:50.430
<v Speaker 3>but this company is forbidden to import </v>
<v Speaker 3>sugar to Armenia.</v>

160
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:51.343
<v Speaker 3>We can to allow them to do this as well </v>
<v Speaker 3>as allow other companies and we will </v>

161
00:08:54.481 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 3>definitely it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There should be no</v>

162
00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>monopolies in Armenia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nicole Pacinian,</v>

163
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.663
<v Speaker 1>Armenian prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's hold on for just a moment because </v>

164
00:09:02.191 --> 00:09:03.024
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not going to be easy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>one because the Republican Party is </v>

165
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:06.804
<v Speaker 1>still controls congress and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative of several ready status </v>

166
00:09:09.301 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>that they won't resign or make it easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the new prime minister and that's an</v>

167
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 1>old old as if that wasn't enough apart </v>
<v Speaker 1>from their own internal problems.</v>

168
00:09:15.871 --> 00:09:16.704
<v Speaker 1>Armenia as two other important </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges and to one of them is </v>

169
00:09:19.951 --> 00:09:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>

170
00:09:28.070 --> 00:09:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Russia and usury threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Moscow has such a huge amount of control</v>

171
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:37.120
<v Speaker 1>over Armenia is economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense and foreign policy.</v>

172
00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.223
<v Speaker 1>Many analysts speak openly about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of defacto occupation without </v>

173
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:44.380
<v Speaker 1>giving any further and the Armenian city</v>
<v Speaker 1>of [inaudible],</v>

174
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:45.243
<v Speaker 1>the Russian army has right next to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkish border and important military </v>

175
00:09:48.491 --> 00:09:49.324
<v Speaker 1>base with more than 5,000 soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mig 29 aircrafts as 300 anti aircraft </v>

176
00:09:54.011 --> 00:09:54.844
<v Speaker 1>missile system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

177
00:09:57.050 --> 00:10:00.010
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't just a military issue to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>large extent.</v>

178
00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:00.883
<v Speaker 1>The country also depends on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>remittances sentence cut by more than 2 </v>

179
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 1>million Armenians who are currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in Russia.</v>

180
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:09.560
<v Speaker 1>I in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Russian giant is its main commercial</v>

181
00:10:09.561 --> 00:10:12.350
<v Speaker 1>partner and completely controls their </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy supply.</v>

182
00:10:12.410 --> 00:10:13.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

183
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:16.730
<v Speaker 1>What does crude in Armenia is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>unnatural?</v>

184
00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.400
<v Speaker 1>It is next to Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major exporter of gas,</v>

185
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:20.323
<v Speaker 1>but it imports it's gas from Siberia as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of agreements that do little </v>

186
00:10:23.871 --> 00:10:26.540
<v Speaker 1>more than legalize Armenia's occupation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

187
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.463
<v Speaker 1>under the terms of those accords,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Yvonne can't make a deal with </v>

188
00:10:30.201 --> 00:10:32.250
<v Speaker 1>Tehran and less Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

189
00:10:32.251 --> 00:10:34.280
<v Speaker 1>agrees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ruben [inaudible],</v>

190
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:38.930
<v Speaker 1>the editor of the Russian service of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in.am Internet portal.</v>

191
00:10:39.050 --> 00:10:39.883
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that so far Vladimir Putin </v>
<v Speaker 1>has had very good relations with the </v>

192
00:10:42.921 --> 00:10:46.040
<v Speaker 1>government and do you all know that </v>
<v Speaker 1>these kinds of revolutions,</v>

193
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:50.270
<v Speaker 1>they don't exactly thrilled Pearson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's a warning on the table here.</v>

194
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Do not pay too much attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seductive calls of the European Union of</v>

195
00:10:54.581 --> 00:10:55.414
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly the 5,000 Russian soldiers </v>

196
00:10:58.011 --> 00:11:02.990
<v Speaker 1>stationed in Armenia certainly help put </v>
<v Speaker 1>this message from Moscow across buts.</v>

197
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.650
<v Speaker 1>That is not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is also another huge threat here.</v>

198
00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.593
<v Speaker 1>Remember the republic of outs like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mentioned her right at the beginning </v>

199
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:10.064
<v Speaker 1>of the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well sorts of a protectorate of Armenia </v>

200
00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:13.283
<v Speaker 1>in such way this Azerbaijan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>considers it to be an occupied </v>

201
00:11:15.921 --> 00:11:18.560
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

202
00:11:18.561 --> 00:11:19.394
<v Speaker 1>they've had no qualms about expressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>their intention to reconquer it and </v>

203
00:11:22.411 --> 00:11:23.061
<v Speaker 1>tear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It must be said,</v>

204
00:11:23.061 --> 00:11:23.894
<v Speaker 1>the confrontations ons unusual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon even relatively recently in 2016 </v>

205
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:28.754
<v Speaker 1>hard confrontations took place that four</v>
<v Speaker 1>days until Vladimir Putin demanded a </v>

206
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:33.373
<v Speaker 1>ceasefire,</v>

207
00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:37.560
<v Speaker 1>it will be asleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The risk exists,</v>

208
00:11:37.561 --> 00:11:41.170
<v Speaker 1>especially because Azerbaijan has oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>and gas that you,</v>

209
00:11:41.370 --> 00:11:42.203
<v Speaker 1>that means money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea as a bit as John's </v>

210
00:11:44.041 --> 00:11:48.570
<v Speaker 1>military budget is as big as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armenian governments in higher budgets.</v>

211
00:11:48.580 --> 00:11:51.060
<v Speaker 1>So if one day Russia decides to wash its</v>
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>

212
00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:54.340
<v Speaker 1>Armenia could certainly get into a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of trouble.</v>

213
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.233
<v Speaker 1>Anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is how things stand in the country </v>

214
00:11:56.621 --> 00:11:57.940
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now it's your turn.</v>

215
00:11:57.941 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Have you even heard of the Republic of </v>
