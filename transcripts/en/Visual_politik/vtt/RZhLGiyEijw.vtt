1
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.760
<v Speaker 1>El Salvador is a small country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

2
00:00:09.761 --> 00:00:12.310
<v Speaker 1>it's the smallest country in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Central America.</v>

3
00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's only geographically.</v>

4
00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:18.970
<v Speaker 1>The country has six point 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

5
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.610
<v Speaker 1>Population that's larger than Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica,</v>

6
00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Belize,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Nicaragua.</v>

7
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.123
<v Speaker 1>That's a large population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when you consider that to </v>

8
00:00:26.011 --> 00:00:31.011
<v Speaker 1>immigration from the country is common </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to various sources.</v>

9
00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:32.224
<v Speaker 1>Some three to 4 million salvadorians all</v>
<v Speaker 1>living abroad with many living in the </v>

10
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.730
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't tell trump it's disgusting.</v>

11
00:00:39.731 --> 00:00:40.564
<v Speaker 1>I don't want to talk about immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>is ever popular with thousands of </v>

12
00:00:43.151 --> 00:00:43.984
<v Speaker 1>Salvadorians each year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>packing up their suitcases and taking a </v>

13
00:00:46.601 --> 00:00:49.210
<v Speaker 1>chance on a better future somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else.</v>

14
00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.050
<v Speaker 1>It's rate of emigration from El Salvador</v>
<v Speaker 1>maintains itself.</v>

15
00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Then there might soon be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>salvadorians living outside El Salvador.</v>

16
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:03.430
<v Speaker 1>Then they're all living inside it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering why are so</v>

17
00:01:03.431 --> 00:01:04.264
<v Speaker 1>many people so keen to leave this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country or you might not be wondering </v>

18
00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:07.281
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's.</v>

19
00:01:07.281 --> 00:01:08.114
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did have to choose a title for this </v>

20
00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:10.400
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

21
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>so let's have a look at why so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are leaving this country</v>

22
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.220
<v Speaker 2>training.</v>

23
00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:17.373
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that El Salvador is a very </v>

24
00:01:18.521 --> 00:01:19.354
<v Speaker 1>poor country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but economics is not the only reason </v>

25
00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:23.020
<v Speaker 1>that people are leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

26
00:01:23.021 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>before we get into details on what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly is causing this accident,</v>

27
00:01:26.141 --> 00:01:28.300
<v Speaker 1>so let me give you a quick bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>information.</v>

28
00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:32.620
<v Speaker 1>El Salvador is a tropical country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can find stunning beaches like these</v>

29
00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:33.543
<v Speaker 1>as well as magnificent nature reserves </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this one as well as amazing </v>

30
00:01:36.401 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>cultural remains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 2017,</v>

31
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 1>this is a year in which the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be celebrating 2017 marks.</v>

32
00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:45.880
<v Speaker 1>The 25th anniversary of the peace </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements,</v>

33
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 1>which puts an end to the bitter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cruel civil war,</v>

34
00:01:48.671 --> 00:01:52.840
<v Speaker 1>which lasted more than 12 years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>caused more than 70,000.</v>

35
00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.823
<v Speaker 1>This conflict was between the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>armed forces and these so called Fera </v>

36
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:04.793
<v Speaker 1>Gonzo Marti National Liberation Front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I left wing paramilitary group which </v>

37
00:02:05.881 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>counted on the support of the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

38
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.950
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the peace agreements,</v>

39
00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:10.793
<v Speaker 1>this guerrilla group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became a political party and today </v>

40
00:02:12.691 --> 00:02:15.000
<v Speaker 1>they have the presidency of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>republic.</v>

41
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Quite the remarkable change.</v>

42
00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.450
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you cmcs yet.</v>

43
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.780
<v Speaker 3>Now,</v>

44
00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:26.613
<v Speaker 1>while this 25th anniversary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it shouldn't be a reason for </v>

45
00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:29.224
<v Speaker 1>celebration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hard to celebrate when you </v>

46
00:02:30.641 --> 00:02:35.641
<v Speaker 1>look at the current situation that El </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador finds itself in the violence,</v>

47
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.423
<v Speaker 1>the 11th of January 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a normal Wednesday where nothing </v>

48
00:02:43.361 --> 00:02:45.730
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary happens that absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

49
00:02:45.731 --> 00:02:46.564
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That date ended with a death toll of </v>

50
00:02:49.091 --> 00:02:49.924
<v Speaker 1>zero in El Salvador and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that unknown events was actually front </v>

51
00:02:53.171 --> 00:02:54.004
<v Speaker 1>page news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason for this being newsworthy is </v>

52
00:02:55.571 --> 00:03:00.130
<v Speaker 1>that als Salvador has become one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most dangerous countries in the world.</v>

53
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's to give you an idea of how dire the</v>

54
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.170
<v Speaker 1>situation is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider this in 2015,</v>

55
00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:06.004
<v Speaker 1>6,617</v>
<v Speaker 1>murders were registered because that is </v>

56
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:13.340
<v Speaker 1>to say there were 105 murders for every </v>
<v Speaker 1>$100,000.</v>

57
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.420
<v Speaker 1>This is the highest of any country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

58
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.630
<v Speaker 1>which is not currently a warzone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This number is really,</v>

59
00:03:22.631 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>truly terrifying and is perhaps best </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrated with a comparison.</v>

60
00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.770
<v Speaker 1>If this figure were applied to the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would mean that there were 70,000</v>

61
00:03:29.771 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>murders a year in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's the real figure for the UK?</v>

62
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:36.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a touch more than 500 murders.</v>

63
00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.740
<v Speaker 1>That's a hundred and 14 times less in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 to figures were a bit lower,</v>

64
00:03:41.741 --> 00:03:44.110
<v Speaker 1>but there were still 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>murders registered.</v>

65
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>This is madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been wars.</v>

66
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people have died.</v>

67
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.973
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe murder is far from the only </v>

68
00:03:49.391 --> 00:03:51.490
<v Speaker 1>serious crime getting down in El </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador,</v>

69
00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:52.840
<v Speaker 1>kidnapping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>extortion,</v>

70
00:03:52.841 --> 00:03:55.420
<v Speaker 1>theft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That all worryingly common.</v>

71
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>So we're going with this great news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.510
<v Speaker 1>who's up for a holiday to El Salvador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

73
00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:00.730
<v Speaker 1>No one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

74
00:04:00.731 --> 00:04:01.870
<v Speaker 1>what a surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

75
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:02.704
<v Speaker 1>given all of this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably no surprise to you that </v>

76
00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:05.473
<v Speaker 1>according to recent surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been indicated that nearly half of </v>

77
00:04:08.441 --> 00:04:09.274
<v Speaker 1>the population of El Salvador wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave and it's really clear to see that </v>

78
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:13.144
<v Speaker 1>this violence has consequences and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't just a fear of crime being </v>

79
00:04:15.731 --> 00:04:16.564
<v Speaker 1>committed against you direct sleep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also affects the standard of </v>

80
00:04:18.911 --> 00:04:20.800
<v Speaker 1>living of all people in the country.</v>

81
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.663
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the Salvadorian Central </v>

82
00:04:22.601 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>Bank violence costs around 4 billion US </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars a year,</v>

83
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.780
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not really that surprising.</v>

84
00:04:28.781 --> 00:04:29.471
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>

85
00:04:29.471 --> 00:04:30.304
<v Speaker 1>he wants to invest their money in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country where you can be killed at </v>

86
00:04:32.681 --> 00:04:34.810
<v Speaker 1>pretty much any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>

87
00:04:34.811 --> 00:04:35.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about this?</v>

88
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:40.750
<v Speaker 1>Foreign investment is the lowest in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Central America.</v>

89
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Even regular people are at risk in El </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador.</v>

90
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:44.283
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these statistics show that you're more </v>

91
00:04:45.251 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>likely to be murdered as a bus driver </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than a policeman in the country.</v>

92
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.073
<v Speaker 1>In the last five years alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>street gangs have killed almost 700 bus </v>

93
00:04:54.191 --> 00:04:59.191
<v Speaker 1>drivers in the regio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is known globally,</v>

94
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.050
<v Speaker 1>but Latin America does have a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem with violence and crime.</v>

95
00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.110
<v Speaker 1>According to a report from the British </v>
<v Speaker 1>consulting from various can.</v>

96
00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.953
<v Speaker 1>Maplecroft glass in America is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region where you have the highest risk </v>

97
00:05:11.101 --> 00:05:13.350
<v Speaker 1>of having a violence crime committed </v>
<v Speaker 1>against you.</v>

98
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:14.243
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six of the world's 10 most violent </v>

99
00:05:15.571 --> 00:05:17.030
<v Speaker 1>countries are actually in this room.</v>

100
00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.913
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

101
00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.533
<v Speaker 1>More incredible than that though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the fact that one in three homicides </v>

102
00:05:25.541 --> 00:05:29.410
<v Speaker 1>that occur every year globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it take place in Latin America,</v>

103
00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.303
<v Speaker 1>even within this dangerous environments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the northern triangle countries of </v>

104
00:05:33.131 --> 00:05:35.440
<v Speaker 1>central America really take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biscuits.</v>

105
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>This area is formed of El Salvador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras,</v>

106
00:05:38.201 --> 00:05:41.950
<v Speaker 1>and Guatemala,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it is by far the most dangerous area</v>

107
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:43.360
<v Speaker 1>on the continent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

108
00:05:43.361 --> 00:05:44.194
<v Speaker 1>when you do consider,</v>
<v Speaker 1>warzones is actually the most dangerous </v>

109
00:05:46.211 --> 00:05:47.044
<v Speaker 1>region in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In these countries which are relatively </v>

110
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>

111
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.740
<v Speaker 1>people have been murdered since $2,000.</v>

112
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.573
<v Speaker 2>You.</v>

113
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>The reality of these numbers is prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Easy to see why people want to leave.</v>

114
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.744
<v Speaker 1>You can't walk the streets safely at </v>
<v Speaker 1>night or wear a watch or a necklace or </v>

115
00:06:05.421 --> 00:06:08.660
<v Speaker 1>start a business without having to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>some criminal organization.</v>

116
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:09.523
<v Speaker 1>It kind of sucks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question that must be on your </v>

117
00:06:11.331 --> 00:06:14.330
<v Speaker 1>mind right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but why is there so much violence,</v>

118
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:19.120
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

119
00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.120
<v Speaker 1>Trafficking probably on your mind now is</v>
<v Speaker 1>just why is this so much violence?</v>

120
00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:27.013
<v Speaker 1>Now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is these countries in </v>

121
00:06:27.771 --> 00:06:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Central America have not always been </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a dangerous places.</v>

122
00:06:30.771 --> 00:06:31.604
<v Speaker 1>It could even be considered relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful until about 20 years ago at </v>

123
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:38.690
<v Speaker 1>least on an individual level boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all started to change by the end of</v>

124
00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.670
<v Speaker 1>the eighties and nineties for two </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

125
00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:41.570
<v Speaker 1>Drug trafficking,</v>

126
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.143
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

127
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:52.220
<v Speaker 1>The drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a serious problem in the region.</v>

128
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.113
<v Speaker 1>Every year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>22 million Americans use drugs and most </v>

129
00:06:55.641 --> 00:06:56.474
<v Speaker 1>of them come from South America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The drug cartels on making an absolute </v>

130
00:06:59.510 --> 00:07:00.343
<v Speaker 1>fortune.</v>

131
00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:01.343
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

132
00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:11.603
<v Speaker 1>this isn't anything new,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this activity has evolved over the </v>

133
00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:14.783
<v Speaker 1>years and just continually found ways to</v>
<v Speaker 1>operate a spice pressure from law </v>

134
00:07:17.251 --> 00:07:18.084
<v Speaker 1>enforcement's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The persecution of the famous Colombian </v>

135
00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:23.400
<v Speaker 1>drug cartels led to a shift in route of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the drugs coming to the US.</v>

136
00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:26.610
<v Speaker 1>Previously it went to Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Caribbean islands to Florida.</v>

137
00:07:26.670 --> 00:07:29.280
<v Speaker 1>Now there's a new route that goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Central America,</v>

138
00:07:29.330 --> 00:07:30.163
<v Speaker 1>and this is the first big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Central America has become a sort of </v>

139
00:07:32.881 --> 00:07:36.180
<v Speaker 1>sanctuary for new Mexican drug cartels </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Central America.</v>

140
00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:37.043
<v Speaker 1>They can organize their business high </v>
<v Speaker 1>drugs and take refuge from justice </v>

141
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:40.734
<v Speaker 1>whenever needed.</v>

142
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.670
<v Speaker 1>It's like now you're probably getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea.</v>

143
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.950
<v Speaker 1>Experts have calculated that 80 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the drugs used in the U.</v>

144
00:07:47.951 --> 00:07:48.784
<v Speaker 1>s have to go through Honduras and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>has led to an extraordinary amounts of </v>

145
00:07:52.261 --> 00:07:55.020
<v Speaker 1>violence in that region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now to the second major problem,</v>

146
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 1>the Morris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't know them,</v>

147
00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:57.773
<v Speaker 1>the Morris Street gangs that engage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of criminal activities like </v>

148
00:08:00.751 --> 00:08:02.280
<v Speaker 1>theft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>murder or extortion.</v>

149
00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.143
<v Speaker 1>Then members are usually young people </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their organization is relatively </v>

150
00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:06.264
<v Speaker 1>horizontal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that they don't have much of an </v>

151
00:08:07.621 --> 00:08:08.454
<v Speaker 1>organized hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They organize an individual criminal </v>

152
00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:11.304
<v Speaker 1>cells which work quite independently </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one another and do take notes here </v>

153
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.070
<v Speaker 1>because it is estimated that in these </v>
<v Speaker 1>three countries alone,</v>

154
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:21.180
<v Speaker 1>the Maris have around 70 to 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>

155
00:08:21.210 --> 00:08:25.270
<v Speaker 1>The most famous of these organizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>all salvage and barrio 18.</v>

156
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:26.193
<v Speaker 1>It's both usually fight against each </v>
<v Speaker 1>other over the control of different </v>

157
00:08:28.531 --> 00:08:29.364
<v Speaker 1>territories.</v>

158
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:31.933
<v Speaker 2>Hi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking</v>

159
00:08:32.030 --> 00:08:32.863
<v Speaker 1>violence situation is complex.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many strategies have been used to try </v>

160
00:08:37.001 --> 00:08:39.230
<v Speaker 1>and solve the problem and they have all </v>
<v Speaker 1>failed.</v>

161
00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:40.093
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two initiatives have been put into </v>

162
00:08:41.511 --> 00:08:42.344
<v Speaker 1>practice lately in order to change the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality of these countries and achieve </v>

163
00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.424
<v Speaker 1>safety for their citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is known as the traditional </v>

164
00:08:48.951 --> 00:08:49.784
<v Speaker 1>task force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a security apparatus formed by </v>

165
00:08:51.981 --> 00:08:54.020
<v Speaker 1>police officers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence experts,</v>

166
00:08:54.021 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>and special units of three countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've mentioned.</v>

167
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>The aim of this group is to find street </v>
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>

168
00:08:58.921 --> 00:08:59.754
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking and organized crime </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of borders or the group </v>

169
00:09:02.941 --> 00:09:03.774
<v Speaker 1>receives support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>training and financing from the United </v>

170
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.280
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of this as clear as Kwon,</v>

171
00:09:08.281 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>Orlando Hernandez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of Honduras,</v>

172
00:09:10.711 --> 00:09:15.711
<v Speaker 1>likes to say we are going to give them a</v>
<v Speaker 1>taste of their own medicine.</v>

173
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>The second initiative is linked to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first and it is known as the alliance of</v>

174
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.684
<v Speaker 1>prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was launched by the Obama </v>

175
00:09:23.850 --> 00:09:24.683
<v Speaker 1>Administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ended expects to improve the living </v>

176
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.140
<v Speaker 1>conditions and the competitiveness of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these countries.</v>

177
00:09:28.170 --> 00:09:29.003
<v Speaker 1>It's main goal is to create jobs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential infrastructure in order to </v>

178
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.850
<v Speaker 1>reverse the terrible current situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To start,</v>

179
00:09:34.890 --> 00:09:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Washington has already committed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend $750,000,000</v>

180
00:09:39.421 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>in order to support these initiatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question is really,</v>

181
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>is there any hope?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is well,</v>

182
00:09:45.001 --> 00:09:45.834
<v Speaker 1>the sort of has to be Mara Salvatrucha </v>
<v Speaker 1>has already communicated that they are </v>

183
00:09:48.541 --> 00:09:50.520
<v Speaker 1>willing to negotiate their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismantling,</v>

184
00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.060
<v Speaker 1>but only time will tell if it's</v>

185
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.013
<v Speaker 4>accessible.</v>

186
00:09:55.310 --> 00:09:57.190
<v Speaker 1>So have you on the region here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic,</v>

187
00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.700
<v Speaker 1>but we would love to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

188
00:09:58.701 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you think these countries will manage</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of their criminal elements?</v>

189
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:03.920
<v Speaker 1>Will the plan is set by Washington </v>
<v Speaker 1>succeeded?</v>

190
00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:07.520
<v Speaker 1>So I'd love to know what you think and </v>
