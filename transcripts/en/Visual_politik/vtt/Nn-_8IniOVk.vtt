00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:09.223
<v Speaker 1>In the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel has become one of the most </v>

2
00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:14.780
<v Speaker 1>important technological powers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and they're using it with a little</v>

3
00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:19.190
<v Speaker 1>more than 8 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country has more than 4,000</v>

4
00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.540
<v Speaker 1>tech companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cisco,</v>

5
00:00:20.541 --> 00:00:21.351
<v Speaker 1>paypal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>

6
00:00:21.351 --> 00:00:22.184
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple and Intel are only some of the </v>

7
00:00:23.871 --> 00:00:26.390
<v Speaker 1>many companies that develop new products</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Israel.</v>

8
00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:27.513
<v Speaker 1>How did such a small island study island</v>
<v Speaker 1>country become one of the world's </v>

9
00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:31.790
<v Speaker 1>innovation leaders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:33.600
<v Speaker 1>we're going to answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In today's</v>

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.070
<v Speaker 2>video</v>

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.690
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most controversial </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world ends in truth.</v>

13
00:00:42.691 --> 00:00:43.524
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty difficult to talk about it </v>
<v Speaker 1>without having to revert a was religion </v>

14
00:00:46.381 --> 00:00:48.460
<v Speaker 1>and various political conflicts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

15
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.463
<v Speaker 1>in this video we're going to try it and </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to try and shed some lights </v>

16
00:00:51.201 --> 00:00:53.250
<v Speaker 1>on a very different side of this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they.</v>

17
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.840
<v Speaker 1>You are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last few decades,</v>

18
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.200
<v Speaker 1>Israel has become one of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest technological powers,</v>

19
00:00:58.201 --> 00:01:01.230
<v Speaker 1>and this is something pretty surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned,</v>

20
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.093
<v Speaker 1>Israel has over 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech based companies and ace of the </v>

21
00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:05.724
<v Speaker 1>largest 500 companies in the wells have </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidiaries here oriented towards </v>

22
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.250
<v Speaker 1>research and innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

23
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:12.113
<v Speaker 1>Tel Aviv right off to silicon valley is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important technological center </v>

24
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.750
<v Speaker 1>in the world may seem impossible given </v>
<v Speaker 1>its size.</v>

25
00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:19.643
<v Speaker 1>Israel is the country in the world with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the third most companies listed on the </v>

26
00:01:22.411 --> 00:01:25.050
<v Speaker 1>Nasdaq.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is only behind is the United States</v>

27
00:01:25.051 --> 00:01:25.884
<v Speaker 1>and China.</v>

28
00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:31.240
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>

29
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 1>More companies are listed on this market</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Spain,</v>

30
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

31
00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:36.910
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Netherlands all put together.</v>

32
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.090
<v Speaker 1>So how about some specific examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

33
00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.840
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all,</v>

34
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:41.673
<v Speaker 1>at the time of this video going out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the next iphone is hardware is </v>

35
00:01:44.141 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>being developed in Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

36
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>many of Google's innovations are made in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel.</v>

37
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:48.844
<v Speaker 1>Bands Intel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's leader in microchips who's </v>

38
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>most of its success to the innovations </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it's Israeli subsidiary,</v>

39
00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:54.813
<v Speaker 1>which by the way has 11,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers and is one of the largest </v>

40
00:01:57.701 --> 00:01:58.534
<v Speaker 1>companies in the entire country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving Microsoft has been considered a </v>

41
00:02:02.471 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 1>semi Israeli radiation.</v>

42
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.660
<v Speaker 3>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is a hub of innovation with top notch</v>

43
00:02:06.661 --> 00:02:07.494
<v Speaker 3>computer science,</v>
<v Speaker 3>academic institutes and revolutionary </v>

44
00:02:09.841 --> 00:02:10.740
<v Speaker 3>technologies.</v>

45
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.521
<v Speaker 1>Hey Belt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>IBM,</v>

46
00:02:12.521 --> 00:02:13.354
<v Speaker 1>Cisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>

47
00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.193
<v Speaker 1>facebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the companies that we use </v>

48
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>everyday who's technology relies a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>on r and d that is done in Israel.</v>

49
00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.453
<v Speaker 1>This actually makes up more than 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of its national GDP and half of </v>

50
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:26.670
<v Speaker 1>its exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

51
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:30.700
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering how did </v>
<v Speaker 1>they achieved such success?</v>

52
00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:31.623
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural factors are usually considered </v>

53
00:02:32.951 --> 00:02:33.784
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today we want to focus on three </v>

54
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:38.350
<v Speaker 1>political keys that were essential in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this process.</v>

55
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.833
<v Speaker 3>Use My,</v>

56
00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.170
<v Speaker 1>the 19 eighties in Israel are remembered</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a terrible decade,</v>

57
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.030
<v Speaker 1>especially from the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

58
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Back then the country was going through </v>
<v Speaker 1>a tough crisis.</v>

59
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.790
<v Speaker 1>Inflation between 1980 and 1985 exceeded</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent every year.</v>

60
00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:56.783
<v Speaker 1>Deficits and public debts were an almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>unbearable financial burden on the </v>

61
00:02:59.801 --> 00:03:00.634
<v Speaker 1>economy in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People felt handcuffed due to excessive </v>

62
00:03:02.981 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 1>state intervention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To a large extent,</v>

63
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>Israel was very dependent on the help </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from different parts of the wells</v>

64
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>and even though the situation started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stabilize by the end of the eighties,</v>

65
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.173
<v Speaker 1>right at that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was a massive arrival of Jewish </v>

66
00:03:15.221 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 1>people from different parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union in very little time.</v>

67
00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:19.443
<v Speaker 1>800,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>new people arrived in the country that </v>

68
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.473
<v Speaker 1>now don't forget to put some perspective</v>
<v Speaker 1>on this number in relative terms that </v>

69
00:03:25.061 --> 00:03:25.894
<v Speaker 1>would be like 70 million immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>arriving in the United States and now </v>

70
00:03:29.531 --> 00:03:31.660
<v Speaker 1>the question for Israel was fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear,</v>

71
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>how could they generate jobs for so many</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in such a depressed economy?</v>

72
00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:38.560
<v Speaker 1>Israel's only option was to reinvent </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

73
00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.363
<v Speaker 1>The government tried to encourage the </v>
<v Speaker 1>new canvas to create companies with </v>

74
00:03:46.441 --> 00:03:48.690
<v Speaker 1>subsidies that would promote the work of</v>
<v Speaker 1>on trapping nurse,</v>

75
00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.553
<v Speaker 1>but they seen realize that this method </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't results in very prosperous </v>

76
00:03:52.591 --> 00:03:53.424
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immigrants who had no experience in </v>

77
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:55.734
<v Speaker 1>management and they lacked commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge and they rarely got any </v>

78
00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:59.220
<v Speaker 1>financing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

79
00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.080
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would want to invest their money in a</v>

80
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.260
<v Speaker 1>turbulent country like Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is when the government realized</v>

81
00:04:04.261 --> 00:04:07.930
<v Speaker 1>that the key was to pass on attracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>international venture capital that isn't</v>

82
00:04:07.931 --> 00:04:10.620
<v Speaker 1>money used for new ideas and new </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

83
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.470
<v Speaker 1>In order to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they came up with the Osmo program,</v>

84
00:04:13.471 --> 00:04:14.304
<v Speaker 1>thanks to yours map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government created 10 funds of </v>

85
00:04:16.041 --> 00:04:16.874
<v Speaker 1>venture capital and allocated $100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars to be used under these </v>

86
00:04:20.341 --> 00:04:21.174
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each Fund's capable of levying 12 </v>

87
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 1>million private investors would receive </v>
<v Speaker 1>8 million in public investments.</v>

88
00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:30.120
<v Speaker 1>In exchange the government would keep 40</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the property,</v>

89
00:04:30.121 --> 00:04:32.250
<v Speaker 1>but in case the investment was </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

90
00:04:32.251 --> 00:04:33.084
<v Speaker 1>the inventus could get these shares from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government just by giving the </v>

91
00:04:35.251 --> 00:04:37.740
<v Speaker 1>government's money back with the small </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rate,</v>

92
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.633
<v Speaker 1>so in 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the funds that came to Israel at </v>

93
00:04:40.831 --> 00:04:41.664
<v Speaker 1>that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lazy about 15 million billion dollar </v>

94
00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.700
<v Speaker 1>which will invested into local </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

95
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.593
<v Speaker 1>So if things worked well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profits would be mainly for the </v>

96
00:04:50.941 --> 00:04:53.320
<v Speaker 1>investors and if things didn't work so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

97
00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:54.840
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Sharon the losses.</v>

98
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.520
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might seem unfair,</v>

99
00:04:56.521 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment was relatively small lands.</v>

100
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Also the government expected to get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>losses back from the new taxes generated</v>

101
00:05:03.271 --> 00:05:06.180
<v Speaker 1>by these new companies and all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs that they would create.</v>

102
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:10.920
<v Speaker 1>The idea was to fire things up and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>continue to reap the ongoing benefits.</v>

103
00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:11.783
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most public programs in Israel have </v>

104
00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:17.070
<v Speaker 1>followed this same system and the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the results.</v>

105
00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>They couldn't have been any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>International money started to arrive.</v>

106
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.270
<v Speaker 1>There was funding for almost any idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in the first eight years alone,</v>

107
00:05:24.271 --> 00:05:29.271
<v Speaker 1>the number of funds rose from 20 to 513.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

108
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.203
<v Speaker 1>Israel today has one of the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>ecosystems fall entrepreneurial capital </v>

109
00:05:32.821 --> 00:05:34.640
<v Speaker 1>in the world and according to the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

110
00:05:34.641 --> 00:05:35.474
<v Speaker 1>cd data and the investment available for</v>
<v Speaker 1>new companies exceeds $150 per person </v>

111
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.720
<v Speaker 1>per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To make a comparison of that figure.</v>

112
00:05:42.721 --> 00:05:45.350
<v Speaker 1>In Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only about three point $5,</v>

113
00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:46.223
<v Speaker 1>which is a solid 40 times less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The key in this process is that venture </v>

114
00:05:49.801 --> 00:05:50.634
<v Speaker 1>capital doesn't just bring money with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this money also comes expertise and </v>

115
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.133
<v Speaker 1>contacts</v>

116
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.143
<v Speaker 2>immigration</v>

117
00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:03.970
<v Speaker 1>that Israel is the country which has bet</v>
<v Speaker 1>on immigration.</v>

118
00:06:03.971 --> 00:06:07.300
<v Speaker 1>The next one out of every three citizens</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been born abroad.</v>

119
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.163
<v Speaker 1>Hands nine out of 10 are either </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or the children or the </v>

120
00:06:10.301 --> 00:06:11.134
<v Speaker 1>grandchildren of immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an impressive migratory number </v>

121
00:06:13.481 --> 00:06:16.420
<v Speaker 1>that explains the growth of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>population from 800,000</v>

122
00:06:16.421 --> 00:06:19.900
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants in 1948,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 8 million today.</v>

123
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.033
<v Speaker 1>In this latest round of immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly 50 French Jews arrived at Tel </v>

124
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:28.660
<v Speaker 1>Aviv's Ben Gurion airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in little more than 60 years,</v>

125
00:06:28.661 --> 00:06:29.494
<v Speaker 1>the population has multiplied by 10.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel is in fact say political and </v>

126
00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>historical exception because their </v>
<v Speaker 1>founding documents,</v>

127
00:06:35.771 --> 00:06:36.604
<v Speaker 1>so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's constitution expresses the need to </v>

128
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.040
<v Speaker 1>have an open integration policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's examine the law of return,</v>

129
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.950
<v Speaker 1>which is still enforced today and was </v>
<v Speaker 1>created in 1950.</v>

130
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Three Jew has the right to come to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country as an older law of return.</v>

131
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:51.940
<v Speaker 1>Article One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't get this wrong,</v>

132
00:06:51.941 --> 00:06:52.774
<v Speaker 1>this is not a minor issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immigration has contributed to the </v>

133
00:06:55.061 --> 00:06:58.470
<v Speaker 1>economic miracle as much as any other </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts that no,</v>

134
00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.440
<v Speaker 1>no matter what populous politicians say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whose aim is often just to get votes.</v>

135
00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:03.343
<v Speaker 1>The wealthiest nations on usually the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones with more immigrants among other </v>

136
00:07:06.641 --> 00:07:07.474
<v Speaker 1>reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's usually because immigrants have </v>

137
00:07:08.321 --> 00:07:09.154
<v Speaker 1>higher rates of entrepreneurship and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also because immigrants helped boost </v>

138
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:12.663
<v Speaker 1>international trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially with their countries of </v>

139
00:07:14.501 --> 00:07:15.430
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

140
00:07:15.431 --> 00:07:17.140
<v Speaker 1>if you are interested about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>

141
00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:17.974
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to link over to some videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>about that that we've put together at </v>

142
00:07:20.291 --> 00:07:21.340
<v Speaker 1>the end of this video.</v>

143
00:07:24.630 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>Education quality</v>

144
00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:32.900
<v Speaker 1>of Israeli education is almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>national hallmark in 1918,</v>

145
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>30 years before the founding of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state of Israel,</v>

146
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:38.840
<v Speaker 1>Jewish specialist founded the Hebrew </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Jerusalem,</v>

147
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:39.733
<v Speaker 1>Israel today as one of the highest rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>of people with college degrees and the </v>

148
00:07:42.621 --> 00:07:43.454
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a lot of success with fusion </v>

149
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.064
<v Speaker 1>companies slash universities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finance for Israeli universities relies </v>

150
00:07:48.710 --> 00:07:51.320
<v Speaker 1>mainly on projects financed by private </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

151
00:07:51.380 --> 00:07:54.910
<v Speaker 1>so there are reasons for universities to</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborate with them further,</v>

152
00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:56.870
<v Speaker 1>they have achieved the best rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>business creation.</v>

153
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.080
<v Speaker 1>In the Oec d,</v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge transfer is a central.</v>

154
00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.040
<v Speaker 1>This is taking the university and </v>
<v Speaker 1>professional world closer together.</v>

155
00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:05.990
<v Speaker 1>God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything went well,</v>

156
00:08:05.991 --> 00:08:08.450
<v Speaker 1>so so far we've seen the main keys to </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

157
00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:11.360
<v Speaker 1>but that all other influential factors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

158
00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.840
<v Speaker 1>there is the Jewish Chutzpah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tendency to question everything.</v>

159
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.693
<v Speaker 1>Something that is key in Jewish culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military service is also a </v>

160
00:08:18.411 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 1>surprising and important thing is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>helps social mobilization.</v>

161
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:24.410
<v Speaker 1>Forcing young people from different </v>
<v Speaker 1>social classes to interact,</v>

162
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:25.101
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

163
00:08:25.101 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 1>compulsory military service isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly great.</v>

164
00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:31.070
<v Speaker 1>It does have some positive effects in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this case.</v>

165
00:08:31.100 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 1>Now we could also discuss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

166
00:08:32.511 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>and that's y'all yahoo's reforms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>2003,</v>

167
00:08:34.551 --> 00:08:36.380
<v Speaker 1>which were essential to Israel's </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

168
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:38.620
<v Speaker 1>but I think it's better to leave that </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a future video,</v>

169
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:39.483
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to all of what we've discussed </v>

170
00:08:40.731 --> 00:08:43.940
<v Speaker 1>today since the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel has doubled its population.</v>

171
00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:44.803
<v Speaker 1>Multiply the number of jobs by four and </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown by an annual average rate of four </v>

172
00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:49.281
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>

173
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>It's GDP per capita is higher than other</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like Spain or Italy.</v>

174
00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.743
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think will Israel </v>
<v Speaker 1>consolidate itself as the leading </v>

175
00:08:55.831 --> 00:08:56.664
<v Speaker 1>technological power in the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could its model will be repeated for </v>

176
00:08:58.630 --> 00:08:59.463
<v Speaker 1>other countries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let us know what you think in the </v>
