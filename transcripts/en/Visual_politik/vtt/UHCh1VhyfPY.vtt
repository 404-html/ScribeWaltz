1
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the travel to Spain.</v>

2
00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.780
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever visited Barcelona in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>or?</v>

3
00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the Canary Islands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:15.040
<v Speaker 1>if you have ensure there is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't much.</v>

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.080
<v Speaker 1>Have surprised you decide the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That scene isn't a crisis.</v>

6
00:00:18.081 --> 00:00:18.914
<v Speaker 1>And as the second highest unemployment </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates in all of Europe and a wealthy </v>

7
00:00:21.411 --> 00:00:22.360
<v Speaker 1>country facilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

8
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.213
<v Speaker 1>clean the roads of brand new pavements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are international airports and </v>

9
00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:26.954
<v Speaker 1>every other city and this state of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>art high speed train network throughout </v>

10
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.010
<v Speaker 1>most of the time.</v>

11
00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.843
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

12
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:35.763
<v Speaker 1>At least on the surface.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madrid has no reasons to be jealous of </v>

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Zurich London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then again,</v>

14
00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:44.440
<v Speaker 1>we also came out as a country that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the edge of bankruptcy,</v>

15
00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:45.423
<v Speaker 1>not such a long time and go and now has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone through one of the biggest </v>

16
00:00:48.641 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>political crisis in their recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

17
00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.360
<v Speaker 3>Premier will have to leave the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>

18
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 3>Congress has passed and impeachment bill</v>

19
00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:00.613
<v Speaker 1>impeachment means that the congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the legislative power loops to </v>

20
00:01:03.651 --> 00:01:04.484
<v Speaker 1>kick the executive out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other countries like America in </v>

21
00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:08.144
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need to propose an alternative </v>

22
00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.840
<v Speaker 1>governments that will substitute for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>format.</v>

23
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:15.800
<v Speaker 1>This makes impeachments attempts almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to pull off in this country,</v>

24
00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.683
<v Speaker 1>but these all strange days and Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 1>political life's the brand new Spanish </v>

25
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:20.534
<v Speaker 1>presidents and the Social Democrats,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Padre Sanchez has managed to convince </v>

26
00:01:23.961 --> 00:01:24.794
<v Speaker 1>the radical left the nationalist right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so the independent Catalunian </v>

27
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.993
<v Speaker 1>parties to vote against the conservative</v>
<v Speaker 1>government of Marianna at a height they </v>

28
00:01:32.571 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>will have one thing in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want more of this,</v>

29
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.830
<v Speaker 4>and now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 4>why did Roy have so many haters?</v>

30
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.030
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>while you might think it's corruption,</v>

31
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.040
<v Speaker 4>and of course this is the official </v>
<v Speaker 4>reason,</v>

32
00:01:47.041 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 4>but beyond the surface,</v>
<v Speaker 4>that's way more of that.</v>

33
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:50.993
<v Speaker 4>As we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Spain is one of the most damaged </v>

34
00:01:52.441 --> 00:01:55.020
<v Speaker 4>countries from the big financial crisis </v>
<v Speaker 4>of 2008,</v>

35
00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:56.003
<v Speaker 4>and the forming government likes to brag</v>
<v Speaker 4>about that economic achievements with </v>

36
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 4>statements like this one</v>

37
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 3>been an honor to leave this country in </v>
<v Speaker 3>better shape than I found it.</v>

38
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 3>Marianna over to Hawaii.</v>

39
00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.110
<v Speaker 1>This is why in today's video we have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of questions to cover.</v>

40
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.690
<v Speaker 1>First has gotten over the crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>already.</v>

41
00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Science and economic growth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment reduction.</v>

42
00:02:18.271 --> 00:02:19.104
<v Speaker 1>This country still has more than 16 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent unemployment rates and other </v>

43
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>countries like Ireland driving faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>than stain,</v>

44
00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:31.050
<v Speaker 1>so can we really save that they've left </v>
<v Speaker 1>the financial crisis behinds and if so,</v>

45
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>what credit because we give to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative</v>

46
00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:34.463
<v Speaker 4>governments also.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Is it a good moment to invest in Spain </v>

47
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.913
<v Speaker 4>today?</v>
<v Speaker 4>We're going to answer with these </v>

48
00:02:38.491 --> 00:02:40.110
<v Speaker 4>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but before we do,</v>

49
00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:42.320
<v Speaker 4>let's take a look back at the history</v>

50
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.580
<v Speaker 2>black.</v>

51
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 1>In the year 2002,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eurozone was created.</v>

52
00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.050
<v Speaker 1>All of the sudden Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

53
00:02:50.051 --> 00:02:50.884
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many other countries started to use </v>

54
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>the same currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the euro,</v>

55
00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.263
<v Speaker 1>and the same interest rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones that the European central bank </v>

56
00:02:57.701 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>fixes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This seems to be a great idea.</v>

57
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:01.234
<v Speaker 1>Having the same currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a German bank and lends money to a </v>

58
00:03:03.141 --> 00:03:06.130
<v Speaker 1>Spanish company on the same conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they wish a German company,</v>

59
00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.760
<v Speaker 1>but these advantages come with a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Spain goes bankrupt,</v>

60
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>this German bank with Spanish debt might</v>
<v Speaker 1>get bankrupts too.</v>

61
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a country does poorly,</v>

62
00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>they might spread to the problems to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>

63
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.290
<v Speaker 1>Swipe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you join the euro,</v>

64
00:03:24.291 --> 00:03:25.124
<v Speaker 1>you must follow some rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is that no country can have </v>

65
00:03:27.681 --> 00:03:29.480
<v Speaker 1>a deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got them three percent.</v>

66
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:33.380
<v Speaker 1>This means they cannot spend more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they collect in taxes.</v>

67
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.273
<v Speaker 1>They said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's fast forward to listening in </v>

68
00:03:35.481 --> 00:03:36.314
<v Speaker 1>history to the year 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the year of the international financial </v>

69
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.650
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many European countries suffer this pain</v>

70
00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:43.484
<v Speaker 1>among them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the unemployment rate goes sky </v>

71
00:03:45.321 --> 00:03:46.154
<v Speaker 1>high until it's the pasta 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that all of a sudden the </v>

72
00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:50.920
<v Speaker 1>government collects little money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes during that,</v>

73
00:03:50.921 --> 00:03:52.970
<v Speaker 1>those international apolis and high </v>
<v Speaker 1>speed trains.</v>

74
00:03:52.971 --> 00:03:54.010
<v Speaker 1>I told you about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

75
00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:58.190
<v Speaker 1>assassinating not cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why the inevitable happened.</v>

76
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.500
<v Speaker 3>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Greece,</v>

77
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.430
<v Speaker 3>and Ireland had the highest budget </v>
<v Speaker 3>deficits in the EU in 2012.</v>

78
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:07.103
<v Speaker 4>Maximum deficits at urec country could </v>
<v Speaker 4>have was three percent saying 10 </v>

79
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:11.574
<v Speaker 4>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This meant nobody wanted to lend money </v>

80
00:04:13.201 --> 00:04:14.880
<v Speaker 4>to their governments.</v>
<v Speaker 4>At the end of the day,</v>

81
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.953
<v Speaker 4>are you going to pay it back when you </v>
<v Speaker 4>spend 10 percent more than what you </v>

82
00:04:18.061 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 4>collect?</v>
<v Speaker 4>If you've followed visual politics for a</v>

83
00:04:20.791 --> 00:04:21.624
<v Speaker 4>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you already know what happens when </v>

84
00:04:22.561 --> 00:04:25.260
<v Speaker 4>investors don't trust your credit </v>
<v Speaker 4>reliability,</v>

85
00:04:25.261 --> 00:04:26.280
<v Speaker 4>rice,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and see</v>

86
00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.640
<v Speaker 1>what did they do well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

87
00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked for higher interest rates.</v>

88
00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.110
<v Speaker 1>Now listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>up in the euro zone,</v>

89
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:36.190
<v Speaker 1>we have an index to measure the chances </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a country to forcing.</v>

90
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.900
<v Speaker 1>It's the so called risk.</v>

91
00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.430
<v Speaker 1>Basically what they do is take the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>trustworthy debts,</v>

93
00:04:46.431 --> 00:04:49.570
<v Speaker 1>phones that exists in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the German bonds.</v>

94
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.750
<v Speaker 1>Then they can pay the interest rate of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the German bonds with the interest rates</v>

95
00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:54.733
<v Speaker 1>of the other ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number that against with this </v>

96
00:04:55.911 --> 00:05:00.200
<v Speaker 1>comparison is called the risk premium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the year 2010,</v>

97
00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:03.590
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish debt at a risk premium of 50</v>
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>

98
00:05:03.591 --> 00:05:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and this was okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but one year later it had 250,</v>

99
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.700
<v Speaker 1>which is five times more</v>

100
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.660
<v Speaker 3>Spanish bonds at brisk as contained </v>
<v Speaker 3>gathers force,</v>

101
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the men in black came </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the eviction.</v>

102
00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:18.483
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The men in black wasn't an given by the </v>

103
00:05:19.991 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>journalist to the European Central Bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers.</v>

104
00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.900
<v Speaker 1>These ECV people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When's the most problematic countries in</v>

105
00:05:25.901 --> 00:05:28.990
<v Speaker 1>the euro zone and requested that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the rules.</v>

106
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:29.883
<v Speaker 1>Basically what they said was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it says right here that you concept the </v>

107
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>deficit bigger than three percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but your giving crazy stop wasting money</v>

108
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.543
<v Speaker 1>or will punish you.</v>

109
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:40.793
<v Speaker 4>In countries like Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 4>these men in black where especially </v>

110
00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:43.673
<v Speaker 4>strict and some even forced the </v>
<v Speaker 4>parliaments of choose another prime </v>

111
00:05:47.011 --> 00:05:49.470
<v Speaker 4>minister who was more fiscally </v>
<v Speaker 4>responsible,</v>

112
00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.430
<v Speaker 4>but one of them is insane.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What did these men in black do</v>

113
00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.660
<v Speaker 1>in the country of Sangria and Pieta?</v>
<v Speaker 1>November the 20th,</v>

114
00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:12.203
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the day when these Spanish </v>

115
00:06:14.641 --> 00:06:17.610
<v Speaker 1>people's party kicks us in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections.</v>

116
00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.473
<v Speaker 1>The Conservative leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mariana or Ohio becomes one of the most </v>

117
00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>supportive leaders in Europe and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to buy it.</v>

118
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Viktor Orban in Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish people's Party.</v>

119
00:06:26.321 --> 00:06:27.154
<v Speaker 1>Your as it's fascinating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pep got 53 percent of the seats in </v>

120
00:06:30.451 --> 00:06:31.284
<v Speaker 1>Congress ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They ruled in most of the regional </v>

121
00:06:33.031 --> 00:06:33.864
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

122
00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.813
<v Speaker 4>Basically Mr Roy was so popular that he </v>
<v Speaker 4>could have probably gotten away with </v>

123
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 4>changing the name of Spain to recoil </v>
<v Speaker 4>lands.</v>

124
00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:44.680
<v Speaker 1>So what was this political program </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the elections?</v>

125
00:06:44.740 --> 00:06:45.573
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically Roy sent to the European </v>

126
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:47.850
<v Speaker 1>Central Bank</v>

127
00:06:47.850 --> 00:06:49.860
<v Speaker 4>guys,</v>
<v Speaker 4>don't worry unconservative,</v>

128
00:06:49.861 --> 00:06:50.694
<v Speaker 4>so I know my economics first going to </v>
<v Speaker 4>reduce taxes and then I'm going to make </v>

129
00:06:54.061 --> 00:06:54.894
<v Speaker 4>loads of business friendly reforms that </v>
<v Speaker 4>would make this country like silicon </v>

130
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.560
<v Speaker 4>valley than those companies helped </v>
<v Speaker 4>people make billions hoppy</v>

131
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.190
<v Speaker 1>and same deficit problem solves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right guys.</v>

132
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.670
<v Speaker 1>Basically the whole campaign was based </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the idea of like taxes.</v>

133
00:07:14.671 --> 00:07:18.150
<v Speaker 1>The mantra for any problem was to reduce</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes and everything</v>

134
00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:23.260
<v Speaker 3>by most important.</v>

135
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:31.543
<v Speaker 4>Did you know the.</v>
<v Speaker 4>What they say during the electoral </v>

136
00:07:33.711 --> 00:07:34.544
<v Speaker 4>campaign is one thing and what they do </v>
<v Speaker 4>one day after taking office is another </v>

137
00:07:39.171 --> 00:07:40.004
<v Speaker 4>thing entirely.</v>

138
00:07:41.700 --> 00:07:45.760
<v Speaker 3>Government must raise some taxes for </v>
<v Speaker 3>some time in Florida.</v>

139
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:49.293
<v Speaker 4>During the months of Roy,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the government raised the taxes </v>

140
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:53.194
<v Speaker 4>including VAT,</v>
<v Speaker 4>income tax and all the special taxes on </v>

141
00:07:54.881 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 4>tobacco in gasoline.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

142
00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.090
<v Speaker 4>A Conservative government made the </v>
<v Speaker 4>biggest tax increase in Spanish history.</v>

143
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:01.983
<v Speaker 4>I want about all of these wonderful </v>
<v Speaker 4>business regulations that would turn </v>

144
00:08:04.031 --> 00:08:06.850
<v Speaker 4>Spain into the new silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>

145
00:08:06.910 --> 00:08:09.340
<v Speaker 4>you can imagine what happens with that </v>
<v Speaker 4>one.</v>

146
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.603
<v Speaker 4>So what happens when you promise a </v>
<v Speaker 4>business friendly agenda and it's come </v>

147
00:08:12.851 --> 00:08:14.560
<v Speaker 4>up with the opposite ones here in </v>
<v Speaker 4>office?</v>

148
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:15.710
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>devices,</v>

149
00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.593
<v Speaker 4>they get angry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but there's nothing they can really do </v>

150
00:08:17.441 --> 00:08:20.890
<v Speaker 4>until the next election.</v>
<v Speaker 4>But the international investors,</v>

151
00:08:20.891 --> 00:08:25.000
<v Speaker 4>they can give you their backs the very </v>
<v Speaker 4>moment you break that trust,</v>

152
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.640
<v Speaker 4>and this is exactly what happened in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Spain.</v>

153
00:08:30.070 --> 00:08:33.250
<v Speaker 3>Spanish academy in huge crisis after </v>
<v Speaker 3>credit downgrade.</v>

154
00:08:33.470 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>Basically the Spanish debt bombs fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the category of trash.</v>

155
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>You remember about that risk premium </v>
<v Speaker 1>that I told you about earlier.</v>

156
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:43.760
<v Speaker 1>So at some points it went to the Satanic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sega of six,</v>

157
00:08:43.761 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six,</v>

158
00:08:44.570 --> 00:08:45.403
<v Speaker 1>many Spanish banks were to the edge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy and no one wanted to buy any </v>

159
00:08:49.551 --> 00:08:51.170
<v Speaker 1>Spanish debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

160
00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:54.820
<v Speaker 1>it was about to collapse and that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean no money to pay doctors,</v>

161
00:08:54.830 --> 00:08:57.360
<v Speaker 1>school teachers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tax collectors.</v>

162
00:08:57.540 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 1>Only one team though anyone could solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>this problem.</v>

163
00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:03.163
<v Speaker 2>Black</v>

164
00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:07.920
<v Speaker 5>to accept rescue from Europe for an </v>
<v Speaker 5>ailing banks.</v>

165
00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 1>So what was this all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

166
00:09:11.431 --> 00:09:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Europe would lend money at a lower </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest rate,</v>

167
00:09:13.551 --> 00:09:16.380
<v Speaker 1>so Spanish banks could not go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In exchange,</v>

168
00:09:16.381 --> 00:09:19.080
<v Speaker 1>they requested the government to cut </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending.</v>

169
00:09:19.190 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>And here is where did his big bad ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>movement,</v>

170
00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:27.350
<v Speaker 1>or as we like to call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly and nomics basically,</v>

171
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.820
<v Speaker 1>once the European Central Bank had </v>
<v Speaker 1>already nailed down,</v>

172
00:09:29.821 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>the banks were highly to those men in </v>
<v Speaker 1>black and set essentially.</v>

173
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.460
<v Speaker 4>What's up dudes,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you think you could tell me what to do.</v>

174
00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:36.810
<v Speaker 4>Look at these bad boys.</v>

175
00:09:42.090 --> 00:09:42.923
<v Speaker 1>Siri was the stainless too big to fail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So despite having the worst credit </v>

176
00:09:45.571 --> 00:09:46.404
<v Speaker 1>rating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine the European Central </v>

177
00:09:47.850 --> 00:09:48.683
<v Speaker 1>Bank would eventually buy all the debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonds without asking to any interest </v>

178
00:09:51.121 --> 00:09:51.954
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How well printing money with this money </v>

179
00:09:54.631 --> 00:09:55.464
<v Speaker 1>Stan could keep being as it was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>without making any costly reforms that </v>

180
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.390
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>

181
00:10:00.391 --> 00:10:01.224
<v Speaker 1>why would the ECB acceptable of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's actually easy because stain has </v>

182
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:07.770
<v Speaker 1>the fourth biggest economy in Europe and</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to let it fail.</v>

183
00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The months while they kept passing,</v>

184
00:10:10.530 --> 00:10:14.490
<v Speaker 1>unemployment's kept growing and so did </v>
<v Speaker 1>that risk premium.</v>

185
00:10:14.760 --> 00:10:15.593
<v Speaker 1>The conservative governments of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>People's party far from making business </v>

186
00:10:18.181 --> 00:10:23.181
<v Speaker 1>friendly reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did about an example prior to them.</v>

187
00:10:26.221 --> 00:10:27.054
<v Speaker 1>The professional services like taxi </v>
<v Speaker 1>drivers were going to the liberalized </v>

188
00:10:30.780 --> 00:10:33.960
<v Speaker 1>insane taxi driver.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Associations are well connected with the</v>

189
00:10:33.961 --> 00:10:34.794
<v Speaker 1>conservative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the right wing pasta bill to protect </v>

190
00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:38.153
<v Speaker 1>taxi drivers from competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why many sharing economy </v>

191
00:10:41.161 --> 00:10:44.160
<v Speaker 1>companies like either an Addie and dee </v>
<v Speaker 1>now have many,</v>

192
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:47.140
<v Speaker 1>many restrictions in the Spanish market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is</v>

193
00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:51.550
<v Speaker 4>the real challenge the European Central </v>
<v Speaker 4>Bank works and the answer is,</v>

194
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:52.803
<v Speaker 5>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>these say B is ready to do whatever it </v>

195
00:10:56.921 --> 00:11:01.921
<v Speaker 5>takes to preserve the euro and believe </v>
<v Speaker 5>me,</v>

196
00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.350
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be enough for Mario comes to</v>
<v Speaker 5>the rescue</v>

197
00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:12.090
<v Speaker 1>four months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ECB president's,</v>

198
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Mario Draghi said he would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise with stain.</v>

199
00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:16.703
<v Speaker 1>Basically rewired wanted him to print </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money so he could buy a Spanish </v>

200
00:11:19.940 --> 00:11:20.773
<v Speaker 1>desks and otherwise Roy wanted the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthier countries like Germany and </v>

201
00:11:24.181 --> 00:11:28.610
<v Speaker 1>sendlane's do give money to stain at no </v>
<v Speaker 1>political cost just because,</v>

202
00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.350
<v Speaker 1>well apparently reasons it doesn't sound</v>
<v Speaker 1>very fair,</v>

203
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:32.311
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

204
00:11:32.311 --> 00:11:35.610
<v Speaker 1>sometimes three rounds he has.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Life's not fair and Roy,</v>

205
00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.260
<v Speaker 1>he was right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

206
00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:38.403
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

207
00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:40.763
<v Speaker 2>thanks</v>

208
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:45.170
<v Speaker 5>b could be ready to buy week Italian </v>
<v Speaker 5>Spanish bonds.</v>

209
00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:49.200
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 percent of the Spanish debt is in ECB</v>

210
00:11:49.201 --> 00:11:50.034
<v Speaker 1>hands and those words from Mario Draghi </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying he would do whatever it takes to </v>

211
00:11:53.291 --> 00:11:54.124
<v Speaker 1>save the euro like magic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day at a time the risk premium of </v>

212
00:11:57.911 --> 00:11:58.744
<v Speaker 1>Spain started falling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investors don't in buying debt phones </v>

213
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:03.520
<v Speaker 1>because they knew they had the backing </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ECB,</v>

214
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:08.270
<v Speaker 1>and this is stain could keep piling on </v>
<v Speaker 1>more and more debt.</v>

215
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:09.333
<v Speaker 1>This country now has a depth that </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents more than a hundred percent </v>

216
00:12:12.340 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>of that entire GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

217
00:12:14.651 --> 00:12:17.050
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the European countries have </v>
<v Speaker 1>started growing.</v>

218
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.513
<v Speaker 4>Two Thousand and 12 Gemini has become </v>
<v Speaker 4>the biggest export powerhouse in the </v>

219
00:12:25.521 --> 00:12:26.354
<v Speaker 4>entire wells.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China has gone from being the world </v>

220
00:12:28.450 --> 00:12:29.283
<v Speaker 4>sanctuary to developing brands,</v>
<v Speaker 4>new consumer market where everybody can </v>

221
00:12:32.301 --> 00:12:34.070
<v Speaker 4>sell their products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>

222
00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:37.700
<v Speaker 4>every European country is growing now </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that of course does include Spain.</v>

223
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 4>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 4>this was good news is every government's</v>

224
00:12:40.460 --> 00:12:41.900
<v Speaker 4>like good news.</v>

225
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:48.420
<v Speaker 3>Spain has got over the crisis in record </v>
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>

226
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:51.010
<v Speaker 1>This is already 2015 in this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

227
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:51.844
<v Speaker 1>Staying at elections again and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government decides to celebrate at the </v>

228
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.600
<v Speaker 1>end of the crisis with a tax cut in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle of the electoral campaign.</v>

229
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Pretty Brilliant News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

230
00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.053
<v Speaker 1>You raise taxes at the beginning of one </v>
<v Speaker 1>election and then one year before the </v>

231
00:13:03.131 --> 00:13:06.130
<v Speaker 1>next election you put them where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to be.</v>

232
00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:08.710
<v Speaker 1>I think that's what happened right after</v>
<v Speaker 1>he won the elections again.</v>

233
00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:09.870
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess</v>

234
00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:10.833
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

235
00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:14.233
<v Speaker 3>Is his taxes again in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the government will have to cut $15 </v>

236

<v Speaker 1>and red tape,</v>

240
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:30.960
<v Speaker 1>that's almost the same if not more </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevalent than before,</v>

241
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.000
<v Speaker 1>and if you consider all the territorial </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems,</v>

<v Speaker 4>previous one?</v>

249
00:13:58.420 --> 00:13:59.253
<v Speaker 4>Do you think Spain has sold its crisis?</v>
