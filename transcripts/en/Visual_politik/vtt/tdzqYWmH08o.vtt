WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.530
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:02.393
<v Speaker 1>I don't think we can talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean without mentioning the </v>

3
00:00:04.021 --> 00:00:04.854
<v Speaker 1>Dominican Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a major tourist destination with </v>

4
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.524
<v Speaker 1>the largest economy and even the highest</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountain in all of the island countries </v>

5
00:00:11.131 --> 00:00:11.964
<v Speaker 1>in the Caribbean.</v>

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.483
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

7
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.870
<v Speaker 1>The Dominican Republic is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very special place in Latin America.</v>

8
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.093
<v Speaker 1>I'm not only saying this because we can </v>
<v Speaker 1>find amazing places such as Punta Cana </v>

9
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.280
<v Speaker 1>by ib or Puerto Plata here among many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many others.</v>

10
00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.143
<v Speaker 1>I'm also saying it because this was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very first place where Christopher </v>

11
00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Columbus has men settled when America </v>
<v Speaker 1>was discovered in 1492 yup.</v>

12
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>It's true for good or ill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything started here.</v>

13
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.500
<v Speaker 1>This is where Latin America as we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it began.</v>

14
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.833
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

15
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.293
<v Speaker 1>It's capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's Santa Domingo was the first modern </v>

16
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.020
<v Speaker 1>city on the entire American continent </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

17
00:00:57.021 --> 00:00:57.854
<v Speaker 1>The first cathedral,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first university in the first </v>

18
00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.220
<v Speaker 1>hospital were belts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

19
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:02.143
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we associate the Dominican Republic </v>

20
00:01:03.501 --> 00:01:05.170
<v Speaker 1>with anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be tourism.</v>

21
00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.390
<v Speaker 1>The Sun Revolution.</v>

22
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>This is by far the country's best face </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not for nothing folks,</v>

23
00:01:23.741 --> 00:01:24.574
<v Speaker 1>the Dominican Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's trendy thanks to its 1000 miles of </v>

24
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.400
<v Speaker 1>coastline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 250 miles of amazing Caribbean</v>

25
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.220
<v Speaker 1>beaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's golf courses and huge all inclusive</v>

26
00:01:33.221 --> 00:01:34.054
<v Speaker 1>resorts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country is experiencing an </v>

27
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:40.060
<v Speaker 1>impressive tourist banner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

28
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 1>this is a story it has been developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a while.</v>

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.333
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the 1940s the then </v>

30
00:01:44.201 --> 00:01:46.660
<v Speaker 1>plenipotentiary dictator of the island's</v>
<v Speaker 1>general,</v>

31
00:01:46.661 --> 00:01:50.040
<v Speaker 1>Rafael Trujillo gave the order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>encourage tourism.</v>

32
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.750
<v Speaker 1>This was probably done with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intention of filling his pockets.</v>

33
00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.440
<v Speaker 1>That sounds the Malecon decentered Mingo</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the first luxury hotel in the city.</v>

34
00:01:56.441 --> 00:02:01.441
<v Speaker 1>The hotel Harroway opens in 1944 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>later in 1968 the first legislation that</v>

35
00:02:02.291 --> 00:02:05.500
<v Speaker 1>considered tourism development to be of </v>
<v Speaker 1>national interest was approved.</v>

36
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an emphasis on tourism,</v>

37
00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:09.080
<v Speaker 1>not exactly new.</v>

38
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

39
00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.720
<v Speaker 1>but in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has completely taken off.</v>

40
00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:17.583
<v Speaker 1>In 2017 the Dominican Republic or </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with just over 10 million </v>

41
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.443
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants managed to attract more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>7 million tourists so quickly that the </v>

42
00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:32.234
<v Speaker 1>country is expected to overcome the 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million international tourists barrier </v>

43
00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.600
<v Speaker 1>in no more than three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Course.</v>

44
00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:42.460
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

45
00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.800
<v Speaker 1>he's got consequences in the last five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

46
00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:45.634
<v Speaker 1>Foreign direct investment in the tourism</v>
<v Speaker 1>sector has grown by more than 500% it's </v>

47
00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.284
<v Speaker 1>multiplied by six times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays the Dominican Republic is more </v>

48
00:02:53.081 --> 00:02:57.370
<v Speaker 1>than 80,000 hotel rooms and this number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't stop growing.</v>

49
00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.240
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.290
<v Speaker 1>Give you an idea</v>

51
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.183
<v Speaker 3>to accommodate all these visitors.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2017 Dominican hotels opened 8,366 </v>

52
00:03:08.841 --> 00:03:12.980
<v Speaker 3>new rooms and an additional 15,000 are </v>
<v Speaker 3>under construction.</v>

53
00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.040
<v Speaker 3>Then needle Medina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>president of the Dominican Republic.</v>

54
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.230
<v Speaker 1>The results tourism is already the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island's main economic activity as if we</v>

55
00:03:20.231 --> 00:03:21.064
<v Speaker 1>take both the wealth this generates </v>
<v Speaker 1>directly and deans I rags and into </v>

56
00:03:23.591 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means not one out of every four pesos</v>

57
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:27.214
<v Speaker 1>generated by the economy from tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say that the Dominican </v>

58
00:03:29.921 --> 00:03:30.754
<v Speaker 1>Republicans can discovered and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to exploit its peculiar type </v>

59
00:03:33.881 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 1>of foil and the truth is that in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>area,</v>

60
00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.530
<v Speaker 1>it's almost all good news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jack Out,</v>

61
00:03:38.531 --> 00:03:39.364
<v Speaker 1>one of their latest achievements which </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in exchange for breaking with </v>

62
00:03:41.891 --> 00:03:42.724
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan</v>

63
00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:47.340
<v Speaker 3>People's Republic of China is opening up</v>
<v Speaker 3>to Dominican tourism.</v>

64
00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.533
<v Speaker 3>The Chinese authorities have declared </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Dominican Republic a tourist </v>

65
00:03:51.241 --> 00:03:53.160
<v Speaker 3>destination for all its citizens.</v>

66
00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:56.310
<v Speaker 1>Of course we asked a moment because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not it folks,</v>

67
00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:57.144
<v Speaker 1>the Dominican Republic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a different face because here </v>

68
00:03:59.281 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>in this country we can find a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>

69
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.050
<v Speaker 1>We can also find a lot of shadows that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we commonly see today in Latin America.</v>

70
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:08.130
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at that.</v>

71
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:15.930
<v Speaker 3>The other face,</v>

72
00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.313
<v Speaker 1>the Dominican Republic has achieved one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the highest growth rates in Latin </v>

73
00:04:21.991 --> 00:04:24.900
<v Speaker 1>America and the Caribbean in the last 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

74
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:25.763
<v Speaker 1>This strong performances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually men's achieving a higher </v>

75
00:04:27.511 --> 00:04:28.344
<v Speaker 1>purchasing power parity as well as one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 10 highest per capita incomes in </v>

76
00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:32.993
<v Speaker 1>all of Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd almost a $17,000 the Dominican </v>

77
00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Republic is paired with Costa Rica and </v>
<v Speaker 1>to well above countries such as Peru,</v>

78
00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.410
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Ecuador.</v>

79
00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.260
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second because that's not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole story yet.</v>

80
00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:47.960
<v Speaker 1>In spite of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>32% of all dominicans,</v>

81
00:04:47.961 --> 00:04:51.260
<v Speaker 1>that is one in every three people live </v>
<v Speaker 1>below the poverty line.</v>

82
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.123
<v Speaker 1>The average life expectancy belly exceed</v>
<v Speaker 1>70 and infant mortality is almost five </v>

83
00:04:56.151 --> 00:04:58.190
<v Speaker 1>times higher than in developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

84
00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:59.323
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

85
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:01.283
<v Speaker 1>That may explain why we can find a one </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half million Dominican's in the </v>

86
00:05:03.751 --> 00:05:04.584
<v Speaker 1>United States and why often tourism </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're missing says are the second </v>

87
00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>largest source of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>

88
00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.220
<v Speaker 1>I think the question we can all ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>ourselves as well,</v>

89
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.300
<v Speaker 1>how can such a paradise not take off?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:21.084
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is that this Caribbean lambs </v>

91
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.280
<v Speaker 1>has many of the evils that unfortunately</v>
<v Speaker 1>are all over Latin America.</v>

92
00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.050
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup,</v>

93
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:31.160
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

94
00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.993
<v Speaker 1>The and modern history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it began here in 1492 now 526 years </v>

95
00:05:36.111 --> 00:05:36.944
<v Speaker 1>later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can find a good reflection of the </v>

96
00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>best and worst in Latin America in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same place,</v>

97
00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:43.003
<v Speaker 1>but delving into this mass of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>great points of darkness we can find is </v>

98
00:05:45.621 --> 00:05:49.820
<v Speaker 1>these stubborn persistence in keeping </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies that have repeatedly been shown</v>

99
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.713
<v Speaker 1>not to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An issue that seems to reign in this </v>

100
00:05:52.881 --> 00:05:54.500
<v Speaker 1>region of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

101
00:05:54.501 --> 00:05:55.334
<v Speaker 1>in matters of informal work irregular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a serious problem that has </v>

102
00:05:58.821 --> 00:05:59.654
<v Speaker 1>spread throughout the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the workers who are exposed to the </v>

103
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:07.160
<v Speaker 1>situation to in formality?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:06:07.161 --> 00:06:07.994
<v Speaker 1>it comes up more precarious conditions </v>
<v Speaker 1>with greater instability as well as </v>

105
00:06:10.911 --> 00:06:14.000
<v Speaker 1>having problems obtaining financing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's to buy a house,</v>

106
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:16.610
<v Speaker 1>invest in the business or properly </v>
<v Speaker 1>educate their children.</v>

107
00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:17.523
<v Speaker 1>And of course they have lower wages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean this is pretty obvious because </v>

108
00:06:23.521 --> 00:06:27.210
<v Speaker 1>the company will invest less money in an</v>
<v Speaker 1>employee who's hired irregularly,</v>

109
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.310
<v Speaker 1>but this is also a problem for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

110
00:06:29.311 --> 00:06:31.080
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to collect taxes,</v>

111
00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:32.183
<v Speaker 2>smooth</v>

112
00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.823
<v Speaker 1>one in the Dominican Republic in formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment affects six out of every 10 </v>

113
00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:41.810
<v Speaker 1>workers in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then I'm going to,</v>

114
00:06:41.811 --> 00:06:44.990
<v Speaker 1>it's not decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's growing in 2017 for example,</v>

115
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:48.290
<v Speaker 1>formal jobs were only created in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>public sector and well,</v>

116
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:49.124
<v Speaker 1>what does this info tell us?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While this is that formal hiring </v>

117
00:06:51.171 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 1>involves many barriers and many burdens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These can be bureaucracy,</v>

118
00:06:54.471 --> 00:06:56.210
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>outdated regulations.</v>

119
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.073
<v Speaker 1>These basically mean that people have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>set up and pay taxes before they even </v>

120
00:06:59.391 --> 00:07:00.224
<v Speaker 1>make a single dollar and all that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Logically it makes it difficult for </v>

121
00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:10.620
<v Speaker 1>private economies do create policy jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this data in hands,</v>

122
00:07:10.621 --> 00:07:12.390
<v Speaker 1>I think it would it make sense to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

123
00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:14.400
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need a boost in formal hiring.</v>

124
00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:15.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's not working?</v>

125
00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.640
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately it doesn't work like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

126
00:07:17.641 --> 00:07:18.474
<v Speaker 1>The same goes for commercial policy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in a country with a small local </v>

127
00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:24.450
<v Speaker 1>markets as is precisely the Dominican </v>
<v Speaker 1>republics case,</v>

128
00:07:24.451 --> 00:07:26.670
<v Speaker 1>the foreign sector is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential.</v>

129
00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:28.130
<v Speaker 1>This seems pretty obvious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

130
00:07:28.131 --> 00:07:28.964
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well in this country we can basically </v>

131
00:07:30.091 --> 00:07:35.091
<v Speaker 1>find two different situations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

132
00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:36.793
<v Speaker 1>there's the free zones where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in stalls have favorable </v>

133
00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both regulatory and fiscal,</v>

134
00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:42.493
<v Speaker 1>which they provide in exchange for </v>
<v Speaker 1>basically only working in export swath </v>

135
00:07:45.591 --> 00:07:48.590
<v Speaker 1>meeting a certain criteria and is being </v>
<v Speaker 1>approved by the government.</v>

136
00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:49.483
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're raw of the more normal </v>

137
00:07:50.811 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they're the vast majority,</v>

138
00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:53.923
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than half of all exports come from </v>

139
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:57.440
<v Speaker 1>the free zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And additionally,</v>

140
00:07:57.441 --> 00:07:58.274
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exports from these places have grown on </v>

141
00:07:59.961 --> 00:08:01.280
<v Speaker 1>average 5% every year.</v>

142
00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:02.123
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

143
00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:07.590
<v Speaker 1>Sports from common Dominican companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:08.550
<v Speaker 1>well check this out.</v>

145
00:08:14.450 --> 00:08:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

146
00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:19.190
<v Speaker 1>upon seeing this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question I ask myself is if the free</v>

147
00:08:19.191 --> 00:08:20.024
<v Speaker 1>zones work well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why not extend their benefits to the </v>

148
00:08:21.711 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>rest of the country so the Dominican </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies can become more competitive?</v>

149
00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately that's not going to happen</v>

150
00:08:26.991 --> 00:08:27.824
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But then there's the issues of the </v>

151
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:30.710
<v Speaker 1>deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public spending and debts,</v>

152
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:31.573
<v Speaker 1>which in spite of the great number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad experiences continues to be a vice </v>

153
00:08:34.751 --> 00:08:35.584
<v Speaker 1>of many Latin American countries here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dominican Republic is also not an </v>

154
00:08:38.991 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>exception since 1990 public spending in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dominican Republic has multiplied by</v>

155
00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:45.500
<v Speaker 1>18 yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public deficits.</v>

156
00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.560
<v Speaker 1>It's almost a tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

157
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 1>just hold on for maybe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because you might be wondering now.</v>

158
00:08:58.981 --> 00:08:59.431
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all,</v>

159
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:02.700
<v Speaker 1>I'm an only talking about a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's coming out of poverty.</v>

160
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's lots to do.</v>

161
00:09:03.661 --> 00:09:05.760
<v Speaker 1>There's infrastructure that needs to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>

162
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:06.870
<v Speaker 1>this ports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airports,</v>

163
00:09:06.871 --> 00:09:07.704
<v Speaker 1>roads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all need to be built so that this </v>

164
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.880
<v Speaker 1>country can grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you know what type of expenditure</v>

165
00:09:11.881 --> 00:09:14.850
<v Speaker 1>grows this the most and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not public investments.</v>

166
00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.713
<v Speaker 1>It's actually current expenditure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is multiplied by almost 30 since </v>

167
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:23.250
<v Speaker 1>1990 and of course the expenses have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be paid partly with more taxes,</v>

168
00:09:23.251 --> 00:09:26.760
<v Speaker 1>which slows down the creation of formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs and investments and well,</v>

169
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:30.330
<v Speaker 1>partly with debt checkout was happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Dominican debts,</v>

170
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:32.900
<v Speaker 1>with the devs and interest because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course debts,</v>

171
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.753
<v Speaker 1>the hands interest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed almost one quarter of </v>

172
00:09:44.111 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 1>governmental spending goes towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying interest.</v>

173
00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:49.300
<v Speaker 1>That's the third largest figure in all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Latin America.</v>

174
00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 1>And it won't stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:09:52.450 --> 00:09:56.140
<v Speaker 1>despite the tourism sector is take off </v>
<v Speaker 1>this constant stubbornness with policies</v>

176
00:09:56.141 --> 00:09:56.974
<v Speaker 1>that don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>explains why Dominican's have so many </v>

177
00:09:58.691 --> 00:10:01.870
<v Speaker 1>problems and why there is still so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty in this country.</v>

178
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:02.793
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out how this country ranks in the </v>

179
00:10:03.731 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 1>global competitiveness index.</v>

180
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.470
<v Speaker 1>And what about politicians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they involved in other things?</v>

181
00:10:16.471 --> 00:10:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And this is not because the shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't end here.</v>

182
00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:24.560
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot more suspicion.</v>

183
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.213
<v Speaker 1>The Dominican Republic is a fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and it probably has a promising </v>

184
00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:36.784
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And wanting managers to take that big </v>

185
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:41.110
<v Speaker 1>step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really well be like a paradise.</v>

186
00:10:41.140 --> 00:10:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good weather,</v>

187
00:10:42.071 --> 00:10:44.830
<v Speaker 1>good beaches ans money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could possibly resist.</v>

188
00:10:44.890 --> 00:10:45.723
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today the Dominican Republic has two </v>

189
00:10:47.170 --> 00:10:48.003
<v Speaker 1>other very important problems that may </v>
<v Speaker 1>be stopping the country from taking off </v>

190
00:10:51.041 --> 00:10:51.874
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of those is corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dominican Republic is among the 50 </v>

191
00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.100
<v Speaker 1>most corrupt countries according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Transparency International.</v>

192
00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:00.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That ride,</v>

193
00:11:00.821 --> 00:11:01.654
<v Speaker 1>the Dominican Republic is considered one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the most corrupt countries in the </v>

194
00:11:04.691 --> 00:11:07.750
<v Speaker 1>world according to Transparency </v>
<v Speaker 1>International's ranking,</v>

195
00:11:07.751 --> 00:11:08.740
<v Speaker 1>Oni,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

196
00:11:08.770 --> 00:11:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Haiti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guatemala,</v>

197
00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:13.780
<v Speaker 1>and Nicaragua in a worse situation in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America here,</v>

198
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:14.614
<v Speaker 1>corruption at all levels is very common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suspects range from the current </v>

199
00:11:17.951 --> 00:11:19.470
<v Speaker 1>socialist presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any limit.</v>

200
00:11:19.471 --> 00:11:20.304
<v Speaker 1>Dina who was accused of having finance </v>
<v Speaker 1>does electoral campaign with bribes to </v>

201
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:27.830
<v Speaker 1>the police themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

202
00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:30.170
<v Speaker 1>it was in the Dominican Republic for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction company.</v>

203
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.004
<v Speaker 1>Oderbrecht in stalls is coordination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sends up for the bribes that it paid </v>

204
00:11:33.381 --> 00:11:35.540
<v Speaker 1>internationally in exchange for </v>
<v Speaker 1>contracts,</v>

205
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.830
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these bribes remains them almost</v>

206
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.663
<v Speaker 1>a hundred million dollars as far as we </v>
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>

207
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:45.260
<v Speaker 1>These were received by politicians and </v>
<v Speaker 1>officials in exchange for concessions,</v>

208
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>work awards and public contract.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

209
00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:52.250
<v Speaker 2>but unfortunately</v>

210
00:11:52.370 --> 00:11:53.203
<v Speaker 1>that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other problem which is growing is </v>

211
00:11:54.941 --> 00:11:57.310
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Dominican Republic is considered one</v>

212
00:11:57.311 --> 00:11:58.144
<v Speaker 1>of the most important bridge countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's narcotics distribution centers </v>

213
00:12:01.031 --> 00:12:01.864
<v Speaker 1>by the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Drug traffickers have a problem </v>

214
00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:09.250
<v Speaker 1>exporting drugs from Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are few commercial flights,</v>

215
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:10.173
<v Speaker 1>little container shipping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no tourists and a collapsed fishing </v>

216
00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:15.310
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the Dominican Republic,</v>

217
00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:18.400
<v Speaker 1>1400 kilometers away has it all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

218
00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:19.234
<v Speaker 1>according to the dea ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European intelligence services </v>

219
00:12:21.221 --> 00:12:22.054
<v Speaker 1>nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dominican Republic is one of the </v>

220
00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:23.853
<v Speaker 1>main transit countries for narcotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>that go to the United States and the </v>

221
00:12:27.221 --> 00:12:29.770
<v Speaker 1>most frequent for cocaine shipments </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to Europe,</v>

222
00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>and of course this is an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

223
00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:34.030
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>about another day.</v>

224
00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:34.923
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be absolutely clear there are </v>

225
00:12:37.401 --> 00:12:40.810
<v Speaker 1>problems that unfortunately are common </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the entire region.</v>

226
00:12:40.870 --> 00:12:43.590
<v Speaker 1>The Dominican Republic has achieved a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot in recent decades.</v>

227
00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:46.960
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly a fantastic place and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a promising future.</v>

228
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:47.883
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just wanted to show you some of the </v>

229
00:12:48.971 --> 00:12:51.850
<v Speaker 1>reasons why this country is not doing as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as it should,</v>
