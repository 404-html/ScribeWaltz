1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.840
<v Speaker 1>In recent times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the meetings between the U,</v>

2
00:00:01.841 --> 00:00:05.540
<v Speaker 1>s presidents and European leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've become quite tense.</v>

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:12.803
<v Speaker 1>Did I say summit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which took place in early July of 2018 </v>

4
00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.520
<v Speaker 1>has been pretty good proof of that since</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's up.</v>

5
00:00:17.521 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>Some questions on the table is Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump writes,</v>

6
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:21.384
<v Speaker 1>when criticizing his European partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the European Nato countries taking </v>

7
00:00:24.511 --> 00:00:28.800
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the United States saw me </v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps most importantly,</v>

8
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:30.960
<v Speaker 1>should Europe have an Ami.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:31.853
<v Speaker 1>this up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if one thing has become very clear is </v>

10
00:00:42.481 --> 00:00:45.790
<v Speaker 1>that Donald Trump isn't too fond of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these European leader meetings.</v>

11
00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean how bothersome it is to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet with all of these people.</v>

12
00:00:50.051 --> 00:00:54.130
<v Speaker 1>I a poor old trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they were at least as fun as Vladimir</v>

13
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.020
<v Speaker 1>Putin or Kin Jong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean finning.</v>

14
00:00:56.021 --> 00:00:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It'd be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

15
00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.920
<v Speaker 2>It's an honor to be with you.</v>

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 3>Thank you.</v>

17
00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:06.433
<v Speaker 1>Is that the clash between the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and most European </v>

18
00:01:09.091 --> 00:01:12.450
<v Speaker 1>governments extends to virtually all </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues economy,</v>

19
00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 1>trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration and defense.</v>

20
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.403
<v Speaker 2>NATO members must finally contribute </v>
<v Speaker 2>their fair share and meet their </v>

21
00:01:19.161 --> 00:01:19.994
<v Speaker 2>financial obligations,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but 23 of the 28 member nations are </v>

22
00:01:23.841 --> 00:01:24.674
<v Speaker 2>still not paying what they should be </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying and what they're supposed to be </v>

23
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 2>paying for their defense.</v>

24
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.103
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US president has been criticizing </v>

25
00:01:31.511 --> 00:01:35.660
<v Speaker 1>NATO for years due to the alleged lack </v>
<v Speaker 1>of involvement of the European partners.</v>

26
00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:36.494
<v Speaker 1>Spin back to the US president has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying things like that for almost 20 </v>

27
00:01:39.641 --> 00:01:40.474
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

28
00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.123
<v Speaker 4>It has no vital interest in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There are conflicts are not worth </v>

29
00:01:46.861 --> 00:01:51.660
<v Speaker 4>American lives.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Pulling back from Europe would save this</v>

30
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.900
<v Speaker 4>country millions of dollars annually.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Donald trump in 2000.</v>

31
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.033
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just about the tenants of the </v>

32
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.880
<v Speaker 1>White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that in recent decades,</v>

33
00:01:58.881 --> 00:02:01.820
<v Speaker 1>the differences between Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 1>America have expanded,</v>

34
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.683
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this baseball versus soccer and </v>

35
00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 1>appreciation for cars with gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>engines.</v>

36
00:02:07.401 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>One can tell where the gas must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper,</v>

37
00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:10.004
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the way in which weapons are </v>

38
00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.510
<v Speaker 1>considered in all fields.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even in defense,</v>

39
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>the army and the military are very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important issues in us politics,</v>

40
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:22.670
<v Speaker 1>but over in Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not so much and it's even worse than not</v>

41
00:02:22.671 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

42
00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.253
<v Speaker 1>these humps even frontpage issues and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're certainly not very popular </v>

43
00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 1>prompts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why since the Cold War ended,</v>

44
00:02:31.431 --> 00:02:32.264
<v Speaker 1>the military spending of European </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that belonged to NATO has </v>

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.680
<v Speaker 1>collapsed in terms of GDP ranging from </v>
<v Speaker 1>something a little over three percent to</v>

46
00:02:39.681 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>less than one point five in Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Military spending,</v>

47
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.033
<v Speaker 1>it just doesn't sell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this view is is greatly angered </v>

48
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>Washington's politicians in recent years</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this matter,</v>

49
00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:50.330
<v Speaker 1>we're not only talking about Donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump,</v>

50
00:02:50.331 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>but also you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama and George W dot Bush,</v>

51
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.263
<v Speaker 1>their own visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a previous video we told you why </v>

52
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>isn't such a good idea for European </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries?</v>

53
00:03:00.011 --> 00:03:03.910
<v Speaker 1>Do you spend more money on weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a minute.</v>

54
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:06.760
<v Speaker 1>What if Washington was actually right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now listen up.</v>

55
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 1>If Washington was right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a question for you,</v>

56
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.703
<v Speaker 1>and as I always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't google it because that's </v>

57
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:22.913
<v Speaker 1>cheating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how many soldiers the </v>

58
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>European NATO countries have in total?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

59
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.990
<v Speaker 1>they'll tell you it's approximately one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point 8 million soldiers.</v>

60
00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.853
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if this number only 30 percent can be </v>

61
00:03:33.061 --> 00:03:37.590
<v Speaker 1>deployed in the case of a conflict and </v>
<v Speaker 1>only 50 to 100 thousands can be deployed</v>

62
00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>sustainably and for greater lengths of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

63
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.570
<v Speaker 1>and folks in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European armies,</v>

64
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:47.210
<v Speaker 1>they've got many operational problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup,</v>

65
00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.220
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do spend a lot of money,</v>

66
00:03:49.221 --> 00:03:52.610
<v Speaker 1>but their governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of them don't really care very much</v>

67
00:03:52.611 --> 00:03:53.900
<v Speaker 1>about the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can.</v>

68
00:03:53.901 --> 00:03:55.550
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look at Germany,</v>

69
00:03:55.551 --> 00:04:00.551
<v Speaker 1>a country that in 2017 had a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget of approximately $45,000,000,000.</v>

70
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.233
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has one of the top 10 largest </v>

71
00:04:04.011 --> 00:04:09.011
<v Speaker 1>military budgets of any country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

72
00:04:09.461 --> 00:04:10.294
<v Speaker 1>despite being one of the countries with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest military budget a couple of </v>

73
00:04:12.731 --> 00:04:15.300
<v Speaker 1>years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a study by the consultancy firm Mckinsey</v>

74
00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.143
<v Speaker 1>for revealed that almost 60 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany's Eurofighter and Tornado </v>

75
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:21.580
<v Speaker 1>fighter aircrafts and 80 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

76
00:04:21.581 --> 00:04:22.414
<v Speaker 1>most modern helicopters were not ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>for combat due to a lack of maintenance </v>

77
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.090
<v Speaker 1>updates and supplies.</v>

78
00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.433
<v Speaker 1>At the end of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a parliamentary investigation showed </v>

79
00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.673
<v Speaker 1>quite a similar results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one of the submarines and none of </v>

80
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:40.820
<v Speaker 1>the 14 main transport planes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German air force or even operational,</v>

81
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.040
<v Speaker 1>not a single one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not even exaggerating.</v>

82
00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.963
<v Speaker 1>Even a document from the German Ministry</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Defense warns that the soldiers </v>

83
00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:50.174
<v Speaker 1>didn't have enough protective vests when</v>
<v Speaker 1>to clothes or tents to participate in </v>

84
00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.890
<v Speaker 1>any important NATO mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

85
00:04:56.891 --> 00:05:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it's not just Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

86
00:05:01.121 --> 00:05:01.954
<v Speaker 1>during the war in Libya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite being a relatively small </v>

87
00:05:04.331 --> 00:05:05.164
<v Speaker 1>conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just three weeks after the attacks </v>

88
00:05:06.851 --> 00:05:09.280
<v Speaker 1>began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European air forces began to run out</v>

89
00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.340
<v Speaker 1>of precision weapons and other words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments spend large amounts of money</v>

90
00:05:15.831 --> 00:05:18.710
<v Speaker 1>on weapons programs and they've had many</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

91
00:05:18.711 --> 00:05:22.880
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't really matter when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to the day to day operations.</v>

92
00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 1>And that's how we ended up with news </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

93
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 4>The Legion declares all out war on </v>
<v Speaker 4>obesity.</v>

94
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.733
<v Speaker 4>The elite unit of the Spanish infantry </v>
<v Speaker 4>launches a plan to combat obesity among </v>

95
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:36.450
<v Speaker 4>its members.</v>

96
00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because that's not the worst of it.</v>

97
00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:44.310
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps what annoys the US offices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most of the rules with which some of</v>

98
00:05:44.311 --> 00:05:47.280
<v Speaker 1>the European armies have entered combat </v>
<v Speaker 1>under NATO.</v>

99
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.380
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Afghanistan.</v>

100
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.680
<v Speaker 1>See many European governments don't want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to assume any kinds of risks,</v>

101
00:05:52.681 --> 00:05:53.514
<v Speaker 1>so they ordered them military commanders</v>
<v Speaker 1>to maintain this soldiers away from the </v>

102
00:05:56.431 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>front.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the case of the Afghan campaign,</v>

103
00:05:58.311 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>US soldiers sharing testimonies in which</v>

104
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:01.934
<v Speaker 1>they were denied medical evacuation by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europeans because they were in a combat </v>

105
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:06.020
<v Speaker 1>zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't strange.</v>

106
00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:06.980
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this.</v>

107
00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:11.440
<v Speaker 4>Ghana's Stan year 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were returning from a mission.</v>

108
00:06:11.441 --> 00:06:13.930
<v Speaker 4>When a rocket hit the vehicle that was </v>
<v Speaker 4>in front of mine,</v>

109
00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:17.740
<v Speaker 4>our Humvee was suddenly being attacked </v>
<v Speaker 4>by machine gunfire.</v>

110
00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.693
<v Speaker 4>Of the 11 vehicles that entered the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ambush area for left inoperative and a </v>

111
00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:25.630
<v Speaker 4>fifth one was destroyed over.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Boys had died and it doesn't.</v>

112
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:26.493
<v Speaker 4>We're wounded.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were six hours away by car from our </v>

113
00:06:28.421 --> 00:06:30.430
<v Speaker 4>base.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was getting dark and the Taliban were</v>

114
00:06:30.431 --> 00:06:31.264
<v Speaker 4>still attacking us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When we call to ask for a medical </v>

115
00:06:33.041 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 4>evacuation,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they asked us if the landing area was so</v>

116
00:06:35.681 --> 00:06:36.910
<v Speaker 4>hot.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We said yes,</v>

117
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.773
<v Speaker 4>we were being attacked.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That moment of voice with a foreign </v>

118
00:06:39.461 --> 00:06:40.294
<v Speaker 4>accent told me that their rules </v>
<v Speaker 4>prevented them from providing us </v>

119
00:06:42.431 --> 00:06:43.264
<v Speaker 4>assistance.</v>
<v Speaker 4>He asked me if we could secure the </v>

120
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:45.424
<v Speaker 4>landing area or if we can move minutes </v>
<v Speaker 4>turned into hours and the Taliban </v>

121
00:06:48.461 --> 00:06:49.294
<v Speaker 4>continued attacking us.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Then out of nowhere a voice came up on </v>

122
00:06:52.211 --> 00:06:53.650
<v Speaker 4>the radio.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It was American.</v>

123
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:54.603
<v Speaker 4>A couple of Black Hawk helicopters from </v>
<v Speaker 4>a totally different mission had heard </v>

124
00:06:57.641 --> 00:07:00.760
<v Speaker 4>our help call.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The pilots deviated immediately.</v>

125
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:04.000
<v Speaker 4>Within 15 minutes they landed in her </v>
<v Speaker 4>wounded were evacuated.</v>

126
00:07:04.150 --> 00:07:04.983
<v Speaker 4>Our superiors told us that the NATO </v>
<v Speaker 4>country who is responsible for medical </v>

127
00:07:07.601 --> 00:07:10.930
<v Speaker 4>evacuations had a rule that prevented </v>
<v Speaker 4>them from intervening,</v>

128
00:07:10.931 --> 00:07:14.170
<v Speaker 4>instill hot areas.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We were furious.</v>

129
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.093
<v Speaker 4>Elliot Ackerman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a veteran who served in the Afghanistan </v>

130
00:07:17.381 --> 00:07:18.760
<v Speaker 4>Marine special operations core.</v>

131
00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:21.843
<v Speaker 1>Just a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is really important in </v>

132
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.023
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nearly 900 European soldiers who have </v>

133
00:07:27.341 --> 00:07:28.174
<v Speaker 1>lost their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about political orders </v>

134
00:07:29.891 --> 00:07:32.980
<v Speaker 1>that don't happen in all cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which are very common.</v>

135
00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:35.890
<v Speaker 1>I know it's not a matter of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a matter of commitment.</v>

136
00:07:35.950 --> 00:07:39.040
<v Speaker 1>Every year the European NATO countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend almost $300,</v>

137
00:07:39.041 --> 00:07:39.874
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars that is together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have the second largest military </v>

138
00:07:47.091 --> 00:07:48.620
<v Speaker 1>budget after the United States.</v>

139
00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:50.620
<v Speaker 3>It's</v>

140
00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:56.963
<v Speaker 1>flight of this in Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want European NATO countries do </v>

141
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.263
<v Speaker 1>substantially increase the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending and that's where the magical </v>

142
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:05.400
<v Speaker 1>two percent of the GDP figures up here.</v>

143
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:06.700
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

144
00:08:14.550 --> 00:08:15.383
<v Speaker 4>the two percent milk</v>

145
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.060
<v Speaker 1>as he made very clear at the last NATO </v>
<v Speaker 1>summit,</v>

146
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:20.923
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is furious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the vast majority of the </v>

147
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:26.960
<v Speaker 1>countries of the Atlantic alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're late in their quota payments.</v>

148
00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:27.823
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

149
00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:29.833
<v Speaker 4>Many countries in NATO which we are </v>
<v Speaker 4>expected to defend or not only short of </v>

150
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:36.290
<v Speaker 4>their current commitment of two percent,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which is low,</v>

151
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.980
<v Speaker 4>but are also delinquent for many years </v>
<v Speaker 4>and payments that have not been made,</v>

152
00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:41.900
<v Speaker 4>will they reimburse the US?</v>

153
00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of two is true.</v>

154
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.453
<v Speaker 1>Either he's saying this because he has </v>
<v Speaker 1>no idea or are you saying it because he </v>

155
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:50.800
<v Speaker 1>wants some electoral points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spa,</v>

156
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>of course fooling the Veritas because </v>
<v Speaker 1>let's be clear,</v>

157
00:08:53.591 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>this entire payments thing has no point </v>
<v Speaker 1>of reference.</v>

158
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:00.383
<v Speaker 1>Two percent is a military spending </v>
<v Speaker 1>objective from each country for its own </v>

159
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>army that has nothing to do with NATO </v>
<v Speaker 1>payments or anything like that.</v>

160
00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:10.710
<v Speaker 1>That is if a country spends less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't own anything to NATO,</v>

161
00:09:10.740 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>the United States or anyone else for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that matter.</v>

162
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after a lot of pressure,</v>

163
00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:19.313
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama managed to get the European</v>
<v Speaker 1>NATO countries to commit to </v>

164
00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>substantially increasing the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget to reach two percent of their GDP</v>

165
00:09:26.461 --> 00:09:29.400
<v Speaker 1>by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 and precisely due to that commitment.</v>

166
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:30.293
<v Speaker 1>Europe is the region of the world where </v>
<v Speaker 1>military spending is increasing the </v>

167
00:09:32.971 --> 00:09:33.990
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

168
00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:34.853
<v Speaker 5>Awesome.</v>

169
00:09:39.130 --> 00:09:40.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know that later,</v>

170
00:09:40.271 --> 00:09:41.104
<v Speaker 1>trump and especially his supporters will</v>
<v Speaker 1>say that this was all thanks to him to </v>

171
00:09:44.471 --> 00:09:47.650
<v Speaker 1>his magnificent negotiating skills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

172
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.513
<v Speaker 1>even if military spending increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably won't actually change </v>

173
00:09:51.341 --> 00:09:52.174
<v Speaker 1>anything first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This two percent figure it's a random </v>

174
00:09:53.801 --> 00:09:58.270
<v Speaker 1>number which could be reached simply by </v>
<v Speaker 1>raising military salaries or cheating in</v>

175
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.860
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of other ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>

176
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:02.733
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the few countries that </v>

177
00:10:03.701 --> 00:10:05.740
<v Speaker 1>complies with this and it spends two </v>
<v Speaker 1>point three,</v>

178
00:10:05.741 --> 00:10:06.574
<v Speaker 1>six percent of its GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a large part of that budget is used </v>

179
00:10:09.011 --> 00:10:09.844
<v Speaker 1>to pay the military pensions and even </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of their investments in military </v>

180
00:10:12.581 --> 00:10:15.160
<v Speaker 1>equipment is geared towards defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>against hockey,</v>

181
00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:20.190
<v Speaker 1>which is another NATO member country as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a result of this.</v>

182
00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:21.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the expenditure rule is </v>

183
00:10:22.211 --> 00:10:23.044
<v Speaker 1>apparently being followed to the Greek </v>
<v Speaker 1>army brings little or nothing to the </v>

184
00:10:26.141 --> 00:10:26.974
<v Speaker 1>organization's capabilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even though all of this money could </v>

185
00:10:29.651 --> 00:10:32.970
<v Speaker 1>be used to really improve the armies and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course without political commitments,</v>

186
00:10:32.971 --> 00:10:35.980
<v Speaker 1>it will never happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not much will be achieved anyway.</v>

187
00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:38.883
<v Speaker 1>European countries will continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>depend on the United States for forced </v>

188
00:10:41.951 --> 00:10:42.784
<v Speaker 1>deployments because each country on its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own wouldn't be able to afford to </v>

189
00:10:44.741 --> 00:10:47.200
<v Speaker 1>maintain that kind of global </v>
<v Speaker 1>deployments.</v>

190
00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:50.980
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence and supply capabilities and</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course given that in Europe,</v>

191
00:10:50.981 --> 00:10:51.814
<v Speaker 1>military operations on popular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither the political commitments and </v>

192
00:10:54.221 --> 00:10:57.220
<v Speaker 1>all the rules friends are in combat will</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually change.</v>

193
00:10:57.310 --> 00:11:00.730
<v Speaker 1>That is we would have larger armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the moments of truth,</v>

194
00:11:00.790 --> 00:11:03.400
<v Speaker 1>very similar deficiencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But also,</v>

195
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:04.293
<v Speaker 1>let's consider something else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The armed forces can perform for </v>

196
00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:08.950
<v Speaker 1>essential functions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>deterrents,</v>

197
00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:13.360
<v Speaker 1>intervention in deployments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation and cybersecurity for none of</v>

198
00:11:13.361 --> 00:11:17.050
<v Speaker 1>these tasks as the current European </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries budgets a hindrance,</v>

199
00:11:23.410 --> 00:11:24.860
<v Speaker 1>two point terrorism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more quickly,</v>

200
00:11:24.861 --> 00:11:27.650
<v Speaker 1>deploy somewhere in the world and face a</v>
<v Speaker 1>special situation.</v>

201
00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:30.440
<v Speaker 1>You don't really need multiple aircraft </v>
<v Speaker 1>carriers.</v>

202
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:31.303
<v Speaker 1>That is redundant forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's much more important to be able to </v>

203
00:11:33.621 --> 00:11:36.020
<v Speaker 1>deploy quickly and manage a conflict.</v>

204
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:39.833
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the latest United States and </v>

205
00:11:41.431 --> 00:11:43.890
<v Speaker 1>NATO wars in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and Libya.</v>

206
00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:46.500
<v Speaker 1>In all of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military victory was simple,</v>

207
00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>but the postwar period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an absolute disaster.</v>

208
00:11:51.270 --> 00:11:52.103
<v Speaker 1>Preparing forces to manage local and </v>
<v Speaker 1>using the country's different </v>

209
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:56.980
<v Speaker 1>institutions to train the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

210
00:11:56.981 --> 00:11:59.920
<v Speaker 1>Not only the military but also from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>police trial courts,</v>

211
00:11:59.921 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>prisons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power plants,</v>

212
00:12:00.890 --> 00:12:01.723
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would probably have been a great deal </v>

213
00:12:04.061 --> 00:12:04.894
<v Speaker 1>more useful at the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>VieW at facing of conflict requires a </v>

214
00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:11.440
<v Speaker 1>lot of things and not always the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

215
00:12:11.470 --> 00:12:15.460
<v Speaker 1>The threats we face today don't require </v>
<v Speaker 1>re craft carriers or fighter bombers.</v>

216
00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.730
<v Speaker 1>They require agility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe doesn't need to spend more.</v>

217
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:21.160
<v Speaker 1>It spends a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just needs to spend better,</v>

218
00:12:21.250 --> 00:12:22.083
<v Speaker 1>and that's where the idea of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>european army in that pascoe a european </v>

219
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:36.950
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in december of 2017,</v>

220
00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:39.220
<v Speaker 1>the european union launched the pascoe </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

221
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:42.040
<v Speaker 1>need permanent structured cooperation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's objective.</v>

222
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:42.903
<v Speaker 1>While that would be coordinating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that participate in the </v>

223
00:12:44.561 --> 00:12:47.530
<v Speaker 1>program in terms of security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>acquisition of war materials,</v>

224
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:50.110
<v Speaker 1>and joint defense in peace operations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

225
00:12:50.111 --> 00:12:53.170
<v Speaker 1>to begin integrating the various armed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces.</v>

226
00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:54.063
<v Speaker 1>The program is still in a very incipient</v>
<v Speaker 1>phase and isn't considered the </v>

227
00:12:56.621 --> 00:12:59.200
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of a european army yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

228
00:12:59.201 --> 00:13:02.110
<v Speaker 1>this could be the best solution to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>their problems.</v>

229
00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.113
<v Speaker 1>The 25 countries that make up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>program by integrating that armies that </v>

230
00:13:08.631 --> 00:13:12.670
<v Speaker 1>weapons purchases their training and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even by sharing resources could mean for</v>

231
00:13:12.710 --> 00:13:13.543
<v Speaker 1>europe even while spending the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>would have a modern well equipped army </v>

232
00:13:16.550 --> 00:13:18.560
<v Speaker 1>with great deployment capabilities.</v>

233
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a country like Spain spends a fortune</v>

234
00:13:24.071 --> 00:13:24.904
<v Speaker 1>buying leopard tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which happens and in practice due to a </v>

235
00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.623
<v Speaker 1>lack of means to deploy them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they only uses them to defend against </v>

236
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:31.593
<v Speaker 1>Portugal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've made a totally unnecessary </v>

237
00:13:33.551 --> 00:13:34.960
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wouldn't you agree,</v>

238
00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.320
<v Speaker 1>folks today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The risks and challenges,</v>

239
00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:41.110
<v Speaker 1>they're global,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I sincerely belieVe that europe needs</v>

240
00:13:41.111 --> 00:13:44.450
<v Speaker 1>more integration to do you think is data</v>
<v Speaker 1>and seek to complete to the us.</v>

241
00:13:44.470 --> 00:13:46.900
<v Speaker 1>Military has contributions within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nato framework,</v>

242
00:13:46.930 --> 00:13:51.520
<v Speaker 1>but it's not achieved by spending more </v>
<v Speaker 1>also almost $300,000,000,000</v>

243
00:13:51.521 --> 00:13:53.080
<v Speaker 1>a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should be more than enough,</v>

244
00:13:54.970 --> 00:13:55.803
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think europe should develop its </v>
