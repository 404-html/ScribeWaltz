1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.420
<v Speaker 1>Does the United States need to launch a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial wharf?</v>

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:04.283
<v Speaker 1>Is the US economy in danger due to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high trade deficit that they carry with </v>

3
00:00:07.741 --> 00:00:11.970
<v Speaker 1>them each and every year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's China competing in an unfair way,</v>

4
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and how can Donald Trump defend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States?</v>

5
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying they're stupid.</v>

6
00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.510
<v Speaker 2>I like China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I sell apartments for 10.</v>

7
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.383
<v Speaker 2>I just sold an apartment for $15,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>to somebody from China am I supposed to </v>

8
00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:35.624
<v Speaker 2>dislike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can continuously have other </v>

9
00:00:38.121 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 2>nations taking advantage of the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States like never before.</v>

10
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.840
<v Speaker 2>The biggest bank in the world is from </v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

11
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.913
<v Speaker 2>For many years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no president wanted to go against China </v>

12
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.350
<v Speaker 2>economically and we're going to do it </v>
<v Speaker 2>because we can't continue to allow China</v>

13
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 2>to rape our country and that's what </v>
<v Speaker 2>they're doing.</v>

14
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.770
<v Speaker 2>In particular with China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be doing a section three.</v>

15
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one trade action.</v>

16
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.013
<v Speaker 2>It could be about $60,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's really just a fraction of </v>

17
00:01:10.011 --> 00:01:11.030
<v Speaker 2>what we're talking about.</v>

18
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.560
<v Speaker 1>Dear viewer intentions are certainly one</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and results.</v>

19
00:01:14.561 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's entirely another.</v>

20
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.680
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely what almost always </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens with protectionist policies.</v>

21
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.573
<v Speaker 1>That ranger to doing one thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they end up doing something totally </v>

22
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.204
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump was very clear about this </v>

23
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.173
<v Speaker 1>during the election campaign that led </v>
<v Speaker 1>him to the White House and he has </v>

24
00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:34.390
<v Speaker 1>continued to be justice clear since he's</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrived in the Oval Office.</v>

25
00:01:34.391 --> 00:01:38.050
<v Speaker 1>Protectionist policies are a fantastic </v>
<v Speaker 1>idea.</v>

26
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.933
<v Speaker 1>I want</v>

27
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.640
<v Speaker 3>those companies and they're starting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want them back here.</v>

28
00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:43.923
<v Speaker 3>I want them back here.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're going to come back here to </v>

29
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 3>trump.</v>

30
00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.860
<v Speaker 1>Signed new tariffs on steel and aluminum</v>
<v Speaker 1>into law.</v>

31
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.593
<v Speaker 1>Trump moves to crack down on China trade</v>
<v Speaker 1>with $60 million in tariffs on imported </v>

32
00:01:56.741 --> 00:01:59.480
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump proposes $100,</v>

33
00:01:59.481 --> 00:02:02.230
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars in additional tariffs on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese products.</v>

34
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.093
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the first terrorist have been </v>

35
00:02:04.481 --> 00:02:07.290
<v Speaker 1>approved such as those on steel and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an alum,</v>

36
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.040
<v Speaker 1>and it excludes many us allied countries</v>

37
00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:16.070
<v Speaker 3>so that steel and aluminum,</v>
<v Speaker 3>your country is not the same.</v>

38
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.180
<v Speaker 1>That's according to the news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump is very,</v>

39
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:19.014
<v Speaker 1>very clear about one thing and that one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his main priorities is fighting the </v>

40
00:02:22.411 --> 00:02:23.244
<v Speaker 1>external deficits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is reducing the difference between </v>

41
00:02:25.981 --> 00:02:26.814
<v Speaker 1>imports and exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a difference of over </v>

42
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.310
<v Speaker 1>$500,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>every.</v>

43
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:33.463
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.760
<v Speaker 1>and that is where terrorists boys come </v>
<v Speaker 1>into play.</v>

45
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.160
<v Speaker 1>It goes something like this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my people,</v>

46
00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.440
<v Speaker 1>they want to buy foreign products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fine.</v>

47
00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.370
<v Speaker 1>Terrorists will teach them about that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

48
00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.141
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>

49
00:02:48.141 --> 00:02:49.340
<v Speaker 1>Let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be fair.</v>

50
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.013
<v Speaker 1>Many argue that trump doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to get involved in a full blown </v>

51
00:02:58.231 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>commercial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Warren,</v>

52
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.053
<v Speaker 1>theU ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s presidents threats especially against </v>

53
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:02.403
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nothing more than a gamble to force Xi </v>

54
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>Jinping's governments into sitting and </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiate and yeah,</v>

55
00:03:11.971 --> 00:03:12.804
<v Speaker 1>that might be saved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but since one never really knows with </v>

56
00:03:15.061 --> 00:03:17.220
<v Speaker 1>trump just in case and to clear things </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

57
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.300
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to ask ourselves a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>important questions.</v>

58
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.720
<v Speaker 1>Does it help the United States open fire</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trigger a trade war tariffs?</v>

59
00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>Really the best way to help the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is China breaking the rules.</v>

60
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:33.480
<v Speaker 1>Are they competing in an unfair way and </v>
<v Speaker 1>do we need to punish,</v>

61
00:03:33.481 --> 00:03:34.950
<v Speaker 1>but using.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.940
<v Speaker 1>let's see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wall Street</v>

63
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:36.903
<v Speaker 4>took a hit today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The new news of the terrorists from </v>

64
00:03:39.061 --> 00:03:43.080
<v Speaker 4>China took it pretty hard.</v>
<v Speaker 4>China's Ministry of Commerce as it is,</v>

65
00:03:43.081 --> 00:03:46.530
<v Speaker 4>imposing tariffs on 128 American </v>
<v Speaker 4>products sold in China.</v>

66
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.260
<v Speaker 4>China announced a 15 percent tariff on </v>
<v Speaker 4>us,</v>

67
00:03:49.261 --> 00:03:51.120
<v Speaker 4>fruit wines,</v>
<v Speaker 4>steel pipes,</v>

68
00:03:51.121 --> 00:03:51.954
<v Speaker 4>and other products.</v>
<v Speaker 4>This is in response to trump </v>

69
00:03:53.131 --> 00:03:53.964
<v Speaker 4>administration tariffs on aluminum and </v>
<v Speaker 4>steel imports from China and other </v>

70
00:03:56.641 --> 00:03:57.474
<v Speaker 4>countries.</v>

71
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.040
<v Speaker 1>Bad Plan for nonexistent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is a question,</v>

72
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.043
<v Speaker 1>what does a politician want when he puts</v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionist policies on the table and </v>

73
00:04:11.211 --> 00:04:11.381
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

74
00:04:11.381 --> 00:04:12.214
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking and I'm not </v>

75
00:04:13.121 --> 00:04:15.370
<v Speaker 1>going to accept a winning votes as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>valid answer.</v>

76
00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.851
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so look,</v>

77
00:04:15.851 --> 00:04:19.210
<v Speaker 1>I know winning votes is every </v>
<v Speaker 1>politician's number one priority,</v>

78
00:04:19.211 --> 00:04:21.640
<v Speaker 1>but for that very reason that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheet.</v>

79
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 1>Let's focus on the specifics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionist policies.</v>

80
00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we could say that the objectives</v>

81
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.670
<v Speaker 1>are usually this defending industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

82
00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:35.050
<v Speaker 1>punishing alleged unfair competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually by poorer countries and boosting</v>

83
00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:36.250
<v Speaker 1>the local economy.</v>

84
00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:38.293
<v Speaker 5>Right?</v>

85
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.720
<v Speaker 1>Are those are the intentions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what are the results?</v>

86
00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.480
<v Speaker 1>If the United States starts a trade war </v>
<v Speaker 1>with China,</v>

87
00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.000
<v Speaker 1>is it going to achieve those objectives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:55.820
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at this step by step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

89
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:58.340
<v Speaker 1>this is what Donald Trump has to say on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the matter.</v>

90
00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:59.743
<v Speaker 1>Under my administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the theft of American prosperity will </v>

91
00:05:02.391 --> 00:05:04.420
<v Speaker 1>end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to defend our industry,</v>

92
00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 1>create a level playing field for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American worker,</v>

93
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 1>Donald J dot trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

94
00:05:08.631 --> 00:05:12.480
<v Speaker 1>Thank goodness that politicians are here</v>
<v Speaker 1>to defend the American,</v>

95
00:05:12.481 --> 00:05:13.430
<v Speaker 1>be both.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

96
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 1>this is absolutely the same excuse he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses to prosecute immigration,</v>

97
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:18.733
<v Speaker 1>defending that American worker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is only one problem and to be </v>

98
00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:23.414
<v Speaker 1>fair is very big problem and that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the statistics show a completely </v>

99
00:05:26.511 --> 00:05:27.344
<v Speaker 1>different situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see the US labor market is </v>

100
00:05:33.281 --> 00:05:37.030
<v Speaker 1>undergoing one of the best moments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost two decades.</v>

101
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.864
<v Speaker 1>The unemployment rate is at about four </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and the number of unfilled </v>

102
00:05:40.511 --> 00:05:45.511
<v Speaker 1>vacancies is growing enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

103
00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:46.993
<v Speaker 1>the American economic machine is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually beginning to suffer shortages </v>

104
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.070
<v Speaker 1>of one of its most important inputs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's of course</v>

105
00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:55.090
<v Speaker 5>if migration</v>

106
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 1>policies do not change in the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't collapse.</v>

107
00:05:58.011 --> 00:05:58.844
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that in the next 10 </v>

108
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:05.021
<v Speaker 1>years the United States will have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 8 million jobs to be filled,</v>

109
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.870
<v Speaker 1>and this is actually happening quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>intensely in the Midwest.</v>

110
00:06:18.871 --> 00:06:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Instincts like Wisconsin where there's a</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of employment,</v>

111
00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.913
<v Speaker 1>but very few workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's great to have more people working </v>

112
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:28.410
<v Speaker 1>in Wisconsin than ever before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it creates a challenge.</v>

113
00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 1>We just essentially need more people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trisha Brown,</v>

114
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:32.783
<v Speaker 1>chief operating officer for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Wisconsin Economic Development </v>

115
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 1>Corporation right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment rates in those states,</v>

116
00:06:38.241 --> 00:06:42.150
<v Speaker 1>it below three percent and the new jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>are constantly emerging.</v>

117
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:46.170
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Taiwanese technology group,</v>

118
00:06:46.171 --> 00:06:48.690
<v Speaker 1>Foxconn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is investing more than $10,000,000,000</v>

119
00:06:48.691 --> 00:06:50.670
<v Speaker 1>in a gigantic campus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do developments,</v>

120
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:52.290
<v Speaker 1>produced new smartphones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tablets,</v>

121
00:06:52.291 --> 00:06:55.770
<v Speaker 1>and television screens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to employ more than 13,000</v>

122
00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:56.604
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The situation is so peculiar that state </v>

123
00:07:00.541 --> 00:07:03.360
<v Speaker 1>authorities have been forced to launch </v>
<v Speaker 1>an advertising campaign,</v>

124
00:07:03.361 --> 00:07:04.194
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on trains in Chicago and indeed here on </v>

125
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>Youtube in order to attract workers to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the state,</v>

126
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:10.193
<v Speaker 1>but not only that you seek.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that the manufacturing </v>

127
00:07:12.961 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>industry now employs a lot fewer people </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it did two decades ago,</v>

128
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:20.190
<v Speaker 1>but do you think this is actually due to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese competition?</v>

129
00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.043
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:22.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is the numbers tell quite a </v>

131
00:07:24.611 --> 00:07:25.444
<v Speaker 1>different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only his employment at its highest </v>

132
00:07:27.431 --> 00:07:28.264
<v Speaker 1>levels in US economic history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial production has also reached </v>

133
00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:34.120
<v Speaker 1>its highest levels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

134
00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:34.983
<v Speaker 1>the industry has fewer people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't mean it produces any </v>

135
00:07:37.901 --> 00:07:40.300
<v Speaker 1>less.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's happening is the factories thanks</v>

136
00:07:40.301 --> 00:07:43.960
<v Speaker 1>to robots and technology are becoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly productive.</v>

137
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.733
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

138
00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.830
<v Speaker 1>how about an example of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the steel industry,</v>

139
00:07:51.831 --> 00:07:55.010
<v Speaker 1>which trump said is being threatened by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese competition.</v>

140
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.903
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his stated that this poses a danger to </v>

141
00:07:57.440 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>national security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

142
00:07:58.850 --> 00:07:59.683
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that the US produces 70 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the steel it consumes for </v>

143
00:08:02.931 --> 00:08:06.830
<v Speaker 1>which only three percent is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended for military use.</v>

144
00:08:06.831 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 1>So him saying national security leads me</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the reply,</v>

145
00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 1>rarely ends on top of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

146
00:08:12.650 --> 00:08:17.650
<v Speaker 1>it's not even in the top 10 suppliers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

147
00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:18.583
<v Speaker 1>Employment in the steel industry has </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreased to almost half in the last 10 </v>

148
00:08:21.891 --> 00:08:22.641
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But folks,</v>

149
00:08:22.641 --> 00:08:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of jobs aren't lost </v>
<v Speaker 1>due to China or international trade,</v>

150
00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 1>but simply due to technology and look a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial war.</v>

151
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:33.650
<v Speaker 1>It's not gonna change that spots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can probably see,</v>

152
00:08:33.651 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 1>this isn't precisely bad nowadays in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

153
00:08:37.311 --> 00:08:40.010
<v Speaker 1>there are more jobs than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the trade deficits,</v>

154
00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:42.380
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite what trump might say,</v>

155
00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:46.550
<v Speaker 1>isn't really that high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being less than three percent of the GDP</v>

156
00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>and in fact it has decreased </v>
<v Speaker 1>considerably in recent years.</v>

157
00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:50.583
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

158
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.970
<v Speaker 1>We're all saying ready for getting some </v>
<v Speaker 1>other important details.</v>

159
00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.740
<v Speaker 1>Like for example the investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

160
00:09:04.741 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>The United States has a positive net </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment balance.</v>

161
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>That is foreigners invest more in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States than Americans do abroad,</v>

162
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously very good for the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy's future in 2017.</v>

163
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:21.300
<v Speaker 1>This positive balance surpassed </v>
<v Speaker 1>$250,000,000,000.</v>

164
00:09:24.740 --> 00:09:27.540
<v Speaker 1>Anything that's all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well you are very,</v>

165
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.673
<v Speaker 1>very wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we've don't know if a commercial </v>

166
00:09:30.991 --> 00:09:33.510
<v Speaker 1>wall would decrease the external </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficits,</v>

167
00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:37.260
<v Speaker 1>but it would have other not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>desirable consequences,</v>

168
00:09:37.261 --> 00:09:38.910
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up to this</v>

169
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>

170
00:09:49.980 --> 00:09:52.440
<v Speaker 1>Let me say it loud and let me say a </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

171
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:53.274
<v Speaker 1>The ones who'd be most effected by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade war against Chinese imports would </v>

172
00:09:56.731 --> 00:09:59.190
<v Speaker 1>be u s companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

173
00:09:59.191 --> 00:10:01.020
<v Speaker 1>You had that rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did not screw it up.</v>

174
00:10:01.021 --> 00:10:01.854
<v Speaker 1>Buying cheaper materials abroad </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases production costs for local </v>

175
00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:07.760
<v Speaker 1>industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if in addition,</v>

176
00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.710
<v Speaker 1>a foreign country in this case trying to</v>
<v Speaker 1>sell it below cost,</v>

177
00:10:10.740 --> 00:10:15.150
<v Speaker 1>it'd been like Beijing was subsidizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Industries at this point.</v>

178
00:10:15.151 --> 00:10:15.811
<v Speaker 1>You might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

179
00:10:15.811 --> 00:10:18.630
<v Speaker 1>this sounds really good about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it actually right?</v>

180
00:10:18.690 --> 00:10:20.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at this</v>

181
00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:21.870
<v Speaker 3>now.</v>

182
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.703
<v Speaker 1>We need to bear in mind that the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States not only important products to </v>

183
00:10:26.101 --> 00:10:26.934
<v Speaker 1>consume from China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also important many intermediate </v>

184
00:10:29.521 --> 00:10:31.650
<v Speaker 1>goods and capital goods such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>machinery.</v>

185
00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:35.100
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than half of all imports from China</v>

186
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to this type of product.</v>

187
00:10:39.790 --> 00:10:40.380
<v Speaker 3>Sorry,</v>

188
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:41.213
<v Speaker 1>now comes an essential question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What with the terrorists actually </v>

189
00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>achieve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:47.723
<v Speaker 1>it's precisely that it would damage </v>
<v Speaker 1>American companies competitive now it </v>

191
00:10:53.961 --> 00:10:54.794
<v Speaker 1>would increase the cost of producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more advanced goods and aspects in </v>

192
00:10:57.831 --> 00:11:00.380
<v Speaker 1>which the North American industry is </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently a leader.</v>

193
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:01.243
<v Speaker 1>This would mean decreasing their exports</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of the world as well as the </v>

194
00:11:04.281 --> 00:11:07.910
<v Speaker 1>consumption capacity of Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and the results of this well,</v>

195
00:11:07.911 --> 00:11:10.640
<v Speaker 1>that's millions of jobs being destroyed,</v>

196
00:11:10.660 --> 00:11:11.493
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

197
00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:14.243
<v Speaker 1>Example of the new tariff on steel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>aluminium will make production in the </v>

198
00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.433
<v Speaker 1>United States of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They use steel and minium like cars and </v>

199
00:11:21.241 --> 00:11:24.930
<v Speaker 1>airplanes more expensive and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>less competitive.</v>

200
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:28.903
<v Speaker 1>Will new tariffs have to be set on cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to offset this hire local </v>

201
00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.224
<v Speaker 1>production costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this explains why when in 2000 and </v>

202
00:11:37.811 --> 00:11:38.644
<v Speaker 1>to President George W Bush impose </v>
<v Speaker 1>tariffs on imported steel to the toll </v>

203
00:11:41.890 --> 00:11:45.730
<v Speaker 1>was the destruction of 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs.</v>

204
00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:48.790
<v Speaker 1>This was a clear backfire if the </v>
<v Speaker 1>intended.</v>

205
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:51.450
<v Speaker 3>I see.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

206
00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.880
<v Speaker 1>That is another really detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

207
00:11:53.950 --> 00:11:54.783
<v Speaker 1>When you sat terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the usual reaction is for the other </v>

208
00:11:56.471 --> 00:11:57.304
<v Speaker 1>posse to defend itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not saying it's the right thing to </v>

209
00:11:59.351 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does happen.</v>

210
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:05.440
<v Speaker 1>The United States announces an </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional $100,000,000,000</v>

211
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.363
<v Speaker 1>list of tariffs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has already fully prepared and </v>

212
00:12:08.501 --> 00:12:12.130
<v Speaker 1>will not hesitate to immediately make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fierce counter straight golfing.</v>

213
00:12:12.190 --> 00:12:14.490
<v Speaker 1>China's commerce ministry spokesman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

214
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:15.363
<v Speaker 1>so let us use the example of Boeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is the largest market today for </v>

215
00:12:20.321 --> 00:12:21.154
<v Speaker 1>this company and in the next few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to deliver hundreds of new </v>

216
00:12:23.621 --> 00:12:25.120
<v Speaker 1>aircrafts to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

217
00:12:25.170 --> 00:12:26.003
<v Speaker 1>it commercial wart would absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaged their longterm competitive </v>

218
00:12:29.171 --> 00:12:34.171
<v Speaker 1>position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

219
00:12:34.820 --> 00:12:35.653
<v Speaker 1>other companies such as Abas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>accelerate the development of a local </v>

220
00:12:38.331 --> 00:12:39.350
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

221
00:12:39.351 --> 00:12:42.050
<v Speaker 1>it does seem difficult today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the longterm,</v>

222
00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:47.080
<v Speaker 1>the consequences could be absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic and that's not even to say that</v>

223
00:12:51.151 --> 00:12:53.850
<v Speaker 1>China could results the other less </v>
<v Speaker 1>orthodox means.</v>

224
00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:54.713
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us not forget that China is the </v>

225
00:12:56.131 --> 00:12:58.920
<v Speaker 1>largest foreign desk for the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

226
00:12:58.950 --> 00:12:59.783
<v Speaker 1>Would it be good for Washington if China</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped buying data or if they began </v>

227
00:13:02.911 --> 00:13:05.630
<v Speaker 1>decreasing securities in order to incite</v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure?</v>

228
00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are pretty obvious questions.</v>

229
00:13:07.081 --> 00:13:07.914
<v Speaker 1>The answer is definitely no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is especially due to the huge </v>

230
00:13:11.221 --> 00:13:14.490
<v Speaker 1>public deficit that the current </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration is fueling,</v>

231
00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:19.520
<v Speaker 1>but wait just a moment because there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that trump is absolutely right</v>

232
00:13:19.621 --> 00:13:20.454
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

233
00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:30.610
<v Speaker 1>is trying to breaking the rules.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has one thing,</v>

234
00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:35.640
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>China isn't precisely a free market or a</v>

235
00:13:35.641 --> 00:13:36.474
<v Speaker 1>country that plays well with others and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't just about the fact that they </v>

236
00:13:39.481 --> 00:13:42.330
<v Speaker 1>have high tariffs or that they favor </v>
<v Speaker 1>local companies.</v>

237
00:13:42.331 --> 00:13:45.270
<v Speaker 1>They're all of them is for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lack mailing.</v>

238
00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.330
<v Speaker 1>Large multinational.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

239
00:13:49.331 --> 00:13:51.490
<v Speaker 1>if foreign companies want to sell freely</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>

240
00:13:51.491 --> 00:13:52.324
<v Speaker 1>they have to ally with local partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>partners who can access that technology </v>

241
00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.890
<v Speaker 1>and Oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this technology transfer is a problem in</v>

242
00:13:59.891 --> 00:14:01.990
<v Speaker 1>some ways because these Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

243
00:14:02.020 --> 00:14:05.350
<v Speaker 1>than use this technology to grow and </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete.</v>

244
00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:08.393
<v Speaker 1>However technological companies know </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they're getting themselves into </v>

245
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:11.923
<v Speaker 1>when they access the Chinese market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has to be them who decided where to </v>

246
00:14:15.291 --> 00:14:16.460
<v Speaker 1>produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how to compete,</v>

247
00:14:16.490 --> 00:14:18.310
<v Speaker 1>and to what businesses to get involved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

248
00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean that the US government</v>

249
00:14:22.801 --> 00:14:25.230
<v Speaker 1>should have pressure or negotiate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

250
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:29.490
<v Speaker 1>but unleashing a commercial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what would be a terribly bad solution,</v>

251
00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.350
<v Speaker 1>so listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as long as it's just threats,</v>

252
00:14:31.351 --> 00:14:32.970
<v Speaker 1>the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be all right,</v>

253
00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.850
<v Speaker 1>but they have to be careful not to cross</v>
<v Speaker 1>the light.</v>

254
00:14:35.851 --> 00:14:39.330
<v Speaker 1>This is how a big crisis would start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>

255
00:14:39.331 --> 00:14:40.164
<v Speaker 1>unless trump insists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it really looks like this isn't gonna </v>

256
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:43.283
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China initiate WTO dispute complaint </v>

257
00:14:46.381 --> 00:14:49.110
<v Speaker 1>against us tariffs on steel and aluminum</v>
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

258
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:53.030
<v Speaker 1>President Xi Jinping announces plans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>open up China's economy,</v>

259
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:53.983
<v Speaker 1>including lowering tariffs for autos and</v>
<v Speaker 1>enforcing the legal intellectual </v>

260
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:58.820
<v Speaker 1>property of foreign firms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

261
00:14:58.821 --> 00:14:59.654
<v Speaker 1>having said all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just wait a moment because there </v>

262
00:15:01.731 --> 00:15:02.564
<v Speaker 1>is still a question on the table and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how can the United States reduce </v>

263
00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:07.940
<v Speaker 1>its trade deficits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

264
00:15:07.941 --> 00:15:11.060
<v Speaker 1>the best way to achieve this is with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bets with structural policies,</v>

265
00:15:11.061 --> 00:15:14.140
<v Speaker 1>doing what great exporting powers like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany and Switzerland,</v>

266
00:15:14.141 --> 00:15:18.230
<v Speaker 1>it favorite saving and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 1>longterm productive investment decreases</v>

267
00:15:18.231 --> 00:15:21.740
<v Speaker 1>the public deficit which boosts import </v>
<v Speaker 1>consumption bike overheating.</v>

268
00:15:21.770 --> 00:15:25.700
<v Speaker 1>The economy improves the competitiveness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of local businesses</v>

269
00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.680
<v Speaker 1>since reducing bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>favoring talents attraction,</v>

270
00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:33.573
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration and lowering taxes as the </v>

271
00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.720
<v Speaker 1>last fiscal reform of the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party did,</v>

272
00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:40.180
<v Speaker 1>which we talked about in a previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

273
00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:43.390
<v Speaker 1>Those are the paths that should be taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they commercial war.</v>

274
00:15:43.420 --> 00:15:44.980
<v Speaker 1>That's going to be just bad for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone,</v>

275
00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:48.070
<v Speaker 1>as in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>external deficit doesn't have to be bad.</v>

276
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:50.440
<v Speaker 1>It all depends on how much the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>grows,</v>

277
00:15:50.441 --> 00:15:53.890
<v Speaker 1>what it is used for,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or what happens with the investments.</v>

278
00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:55.060

<v Speaker 1>now over to you,</v>
