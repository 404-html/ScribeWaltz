1
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.923
<v Speaker 1>Isn't her douse the trade war is one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the hottest topics in international </v>

2
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:13.580
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>payroll,</v>

3
00:00:13.581 --> 00:00:14.181
<v Speaker 1>visual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>

4
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:15.014
<v Speaker 1>We've already spoken about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences that this trade wall may </v>

5
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.520
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which may already be having.</v>

6
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.000
<v Speaker 1>However we should explore requestion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you have already asked,</v>

7
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.863
<v Speaker 1>especially through our patrion page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is essential for analyzing this </v>

8
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.033
<v Speaker 1>entire matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does the United States have some </v>

9
00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:32.120
<v Speaker 1>shot at launch?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trade deficits,</v>

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:37.130
<v Speaker 1>indeed this gigantic deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the past $550 billion dollars in 2017,</v>

11
00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.993
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how serious is it and how can it be </v>

12
00:00:40.131 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>fixed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While some of you might be thinking,</v>

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's easy,</v>

14
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.503
<v Speaker 1>there's a trade deficit because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States imports more than it </v>

15
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:47.683
<v Speaker 1>exports among other things because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the evil unfair competition that has de </v>

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.380
<v Speaker 1>industrialized the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we punish imports,</v>

17
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.110
<v Speaker 1>the trade deficit will decrease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

18
00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:58.033
<v Speaker 1>I mean after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the stance of the White House </v>

19
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>president trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:05.060
<v Speaker 1>just a moment here because things aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere near as simple as this.</v>

21
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Listen up the easy equation</v>

22
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>choose,</v>

23
00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.610
<v Speaker 1>magnify and report problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>steps in place,</v>

24
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.460
<v Speaker 1>a number on the table that we can all </v>
<v Speaker 1>visualize.</v>

25
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.890
<v Speaker 1>Step three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creates ends blaming enemy,</v>

26
00:01:25.891 --> 00:01:28.650
<v Speaker 1>whether it's real or not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't really matter.</v>

27
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.820
<v Speaker 1>Step four,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

28
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:30.713
<v Speaker 1>every one of the consequences of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem and finally ends with a simple </v>

29
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.650
<v Speaker 1>and electoral remedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is also false.</v>

30
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.513
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are the steps for creating a </v>

31
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.823
<v Speaker 1>populist political discourse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a discourse that at the moment of truth </v>

32
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.690
<v Speaker 1>maybe worth absolutely nothing but will </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly help you win elections.</v>

33
00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:50.633
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what the White House is </v>

34
00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:52.944
<v Speaker 1>doing with the aim of winning votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have created a political discourse </v>

35
00:01:55.711 --> 00:01:58.650
<v Speaker 1>that so to speak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is fundamentally based on eight,</v>

36
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.030
<v Speaker 1>three elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Equation,</v>

37
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>but do not worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has nothing to do with maths,</v>

38
00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.213
<v Speaker 1>at least not entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven's the trade deficit causes </v>

39
00:02:09.741 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>terrible damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seconds elements.</v>

40
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:14.780
<v Speaker 1>This damages due to the other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfair competition,</v>

41
00:02:14.781 --> 00:02:18.980
<v Speaker 1>especially China and third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the threat due to the other countries,</v>

42
00:02:18.981 --> 00:02:23.000
<v Speaker 1>bad behavior and the US as industry and </v>
<v Speaker 1>power is falling apart.</v>

43
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

44
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:30.190
<v Speaker 1>discourse is one thing and the reality </v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite different.</v>

45
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:31.413
<v Speaker 1>To magnify the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump's commercial advises us </v>

46
00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.193
<v Speaker 1>again and again about the negative </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts that this whole trade deficits </v>

47
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:39.783
<v Speaker 1>has on the North American economy today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they use the accounting entity that </v>

48
00:02:43.481 --> 00:02:44.314
<v Speaker 1>you're seeing on the screen right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the formulas used to </v>

49
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:48.064
<v Speaker 1>calculate the GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US GDP equals consumption plus </v>

50
00:02:50.561 --> 00:02:54.310
<v Speaker 1>investment plus public spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus exports minus imports.</v>

51
00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.950
<v Speaker 1>I mean there's really economics 101 </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

52
00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.973
<v Speaker 1>Well the fact is that seeing it this way</v>
<v Speaker 1>makes it look like the trade deficit is </v>

53
00:03:02.921 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>causing a huge amount of damage to the U</v>
<v Speaker 1>s economy.</v>

54
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>And of course if the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports and imports decreases,</v>

55
00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.700
<v Speaker 1>then the GDP would increase prosperity </v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone.</v>

56
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>Easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.553
<v Speaker 1>Well hold on a second because this all </v>
<v Speaker 1>implies simplifying things to the point </v>

58
00:03:20.831 --> 00:03:24.490
<v Speaker 1>where any resemblance to reality is </v>
<v Speaker 1>purely coincidental.</v>

59
00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.440
<v Speaker 1>So why do I say this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that's because relations with the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world have a lot and I mean a lot</v>

61
00:03:31.271 --> 00:03:34.720
<v Speaker 1>of influence on the other sections that </v>
<v Speaker 1>make up the GDP.</v>

62
00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.100
<v Speaker 2>Are you listening</v>

63
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day when a foreigner </v>
<v Speaker 1>invests in the United States?</v>

64
00:03:44.951 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>So when US companies buy raw materials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>capital goods,</v>

65
00:03:48.131 --> 00:03:50.830
<v Speaker 1>or intermediate goods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects on the economy,</v>

66
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.110
<v Speaker 1>it's not exactly negative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the opposite.</v>

67
00:03:53.111 --> 00:03:54.220
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for example,</v>

68
00:03:54.221 --> 00:03:56.530
<v Speaker 1>all these goods become expensive because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of tariffs,</v>

69
00:03:56.531 --> 00:03:58.900
<v Speaker 1>then companies lose competitiveness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heroin,</v>

70
00:03:58.901 --> 00:04:00.520
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already talked,</v>

71
00:04:00.521 --> 00:04:01.354
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about how terrorists have caused Harley </v>

72
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.740
<v Speaker 1>Davidson to move its processes to Europe</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a similar way,</v>

73
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.190
<v Speaker 1>more expensive import products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also affects the retail sector.</v>

74
00:04:09.191 --> 00:04:10.024
<v Speaker 1>So that in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship of this supposed trade </v>

75
00:04:12.551 --> 00:04:17.530
<v Speaker 1>deficit with the GDP isn't as direct as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it might at first seem.</v>

76
00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.633
<v Speaker 1>The second element of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse that the White House uses is </v>

77
00:04:23.431 --> 00:04:26.490
<v Speaker 1>that of unfair competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the case of China.</v>

78
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:29.520
<v Speaker 1>And of course supposedly because of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing's bat actions,</v>

79
00:04:29.521 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 1>China's goods and services deficit alone</v>
<v Speaker 1>exceeds $300,000,000,000</v>

80
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:38.160
<v Speaker 1>per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's when from things,</v>

81
00:04:38.161 --> 00:04:38.994
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's see if we decrease China's trade </v>

82
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:42.210
<v Speaker 1>deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then problem solved,</v>

83
00:04:42.211 --> 00:04:43.530
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well folks,</v>

84
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:44.364
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't actually work that way </v>

85
00:04:45.661 --> 00:04:46.351
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

86
00:04:46.351 --> 00:04:49.470
<v Speaker 1>this unfair competition is at the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>least questionable.</v>

87
00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.393
<v Speaker 1>China has been blamed for manipulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>its currency and that's just not really </v>

88
00:04:54.421 --> 00:04:55.410
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

89
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 1>it's actually the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

90
00:04:57.811 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese yuan has risen a lot against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dollar and do you know what happened</v>

91
00:05:01.741 --> 00:05:03.930
<v Speaker 1>to the trade deficit with China?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Went to Beijing,</v>

92
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 1>didn't devalue its currency to export </v>
<v Speaker 1>more or they shot up?</v>

93
00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:19.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in reality,</v>

94
00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:23.300
<v Speaker 1>the US a trade deficit with East Asia in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of manufactured goods,</v>

95
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.330
<v Speaker 1>has been more or less constant since the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid nineties.</v>

96
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.583
<v Speaker 1>What has changed is that what ones came </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Taiwan or Japan among others now </v>

97
00:05:33.201 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 1>comes directly from China and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's a great assembly center and</v>

98
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:42.740
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what fattens the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade deficit with China quite so much.</v>

99
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.033
<v Speaker 1>And regarding that last point is the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>about deindustrialization and loss of </v>

100
00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness due to unfair </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

101
00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:52.190
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it isn't true either.</v>

102
00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:53.083
<v Speaker 1>US exports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which remains the second largest </v>

103
00:05:55.041 --> 00:05:59.420
<v Speaker 1>exporter in the world are at record,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like industrial production.</v>

104
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:04.510
<v Speaker 1>Check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>

105
00:06:07.311 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>but China isn't devouring the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

106
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.953
<v Speaker 1>Just a second then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If trump's arguments aren't true about </v>

107
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:19.200
<v Speaker 1>the entire United States trade deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is that such an imbalance?</v>

108
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:21.560
<v Speaker 1>What are the real reasons for it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

109
00:06:21.561 --> 00:06:26.561
<v Speaker 1>listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real reasons you may be surprised to</v>

110
00:06:33.651 --> 00:06:34.484
<v Speaker 1>find out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what caused the US trade deficit </v>

111
00:06:36.081 --> 00:06:41.081
<v Speaker 1>wasn't any country's unfair competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time the fault is all at higher.</v>

112
00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.043
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving the theories that speak of evil </v>

113
00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:47.300
<v Speaker 1>Chinese schemes to destroy the West </v>
<v Speaker 1>might be less exciting,</v>

114
00:06:47.301 --> 00:06:50.030
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just the way things are.</v>

115
00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:59.120
<v Speaker 1>The commercial whole is due to the low </v>
<v Speaker 1>savings rate in the United States.</v>

116
00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.013
<v Speaker 1>The United States dollar is a reserve </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency which makes it highly demanded </v>

117
00:07:03.021 --> 00:07:03.854
<v Speaker 1>and I have a values and then there's the</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of capital that comes to </v>

118
00:07:05.991 --> 00:07:08.180
<v Speaker 1>the United States every year from </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>

119
00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:09.043
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from China as we are going to see this </v>

120
00:07:10.491 --> 00:07:13.940
<v Speaker 1>is what explains why the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>spent more than 40 years.</v>

121
00:07:13.941 --> 00:07:16.730
<v Speaker 1>We have a trade deficit without the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy's suffering.</v>

122
00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:17.623
<v Speaker 1>Forty years in a row can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming more than it produces because </v>

123
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:21.674
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump always talks about the trade </v>

124
00:07:23.001 --> 00:07:27.140
<v Speaker 1>balance but never talks about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial balance and that's the trap.</v>

125
00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.073
<v Speaker 3>$800,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>a year trade deficit with other nations </v>

126
00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.090
<v Speaker 3>unaccepted.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They send the Mercedes,</v>

127
00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 3>they sent bmw,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they send everything</v>

128
00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:45.700
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last game</v>

129
00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:48.733
<v Speaker 1>and economic law that the US president </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be unfamiliar with the balance </v>

130
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.634
<v Speaker 1>of payments which measures the monetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions of a country with the </v>

131
00:07:55.161 --> 00:07:55.994
<v Speaker 1>exterior is always in equilibrium in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system of floating exchange rates like </v>

132
00:07:59.931 --> 00:08:03.230
<v Speaker 1>the one that exists nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain that a bit further.</v>

133
00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 1>When there's a trade deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's basically compensated by capital or</v>

134
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:08.204
<v Speaker 1>financial account surpluses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which more or less reflect the balance </v>

135
00:08:11.721 --> 00:08:15.140
<v Speaker 1>between the capital that arrives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and what leaves it.</v>

136
00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:18.860
<v Speaker 1>That's the money that comes in and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money that goes out.</v>

137
00:08:19.700 --> 00:08:24.200
<v Speaker 1>A persistent current account surplus is </v>
<v Speaker 1>always balanced out by a capital account</v>

138
00:08:24.201 --> 00:08:25.034
<v Speaker 1>deficit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the eternal laws of </v>

139
00:08:26.331 --> 00:08:27.164
<v Speaker 1>economics like gravity and physics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conrad poot sear a reporter at the real </v>

140
00:08:30.951 --> 00:08:31.784
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at what happens precisely with the </v>

141
00:08:34.670 --> 00:08:35.503
<v Speaker 1>United States balance of payment</v>

142
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.690
<v Speaker 4>s.</v>
<v Speaker 4>As you can</v>

143
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:44.190
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade deficit is offset by surpluses</v>

144
00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>in the financial balances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

145
00:08:46.290 --> 00:08:50.460
<v Speaker 1>does this mean that a country can buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it wants abroad without limits?</v>

146
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.150
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

147
00:08:51.150 --> 00:08:51.983
<v Speaker 1>obviously not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It can only important if it manages to </v>

148
00:08:54.151 --> 00:08:56.300
<v Speaker 1>finance or for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's important.</v>

149
00:08:56.301 --> 00:08:57.134
<v Speaker 1>We have capital that comes from abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise first its currency would </v>

150
00:08:59.851 --> 00:09:00.684
<v Speaker 1>depreciate a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say pure law of supply and demand is </v>

151
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:06.180
<v Speaker 1>high demand for foreign currency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer local currency,</v>

152
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.043
<v Speaker 1>and then eventually the foreign currency</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves of the central bank would dry </v>

153
00:09:09.661 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>up on leashing and exchange crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that in Latin America,</v>

154
00:09:14.101 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>especially in Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is very well known.</v>

155
00:09:19.790 --> 00:09:20.551
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

156
00:09:20.551 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>so what happens in the U s case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

157
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:26.940
<v Speaker 1>America is the greatest refuge for </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital on the entire planet.</v>

158
00:09:27.030 --> 00:09:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

159
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:28.973
<v Speaker 1>huge amounts of capital and so the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country practically half of the world's </v>

160
00:09:31.791 --> 00:09:32.624
<v Speaker 1>savings spent investing in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either his loans direct foreign </v>

161
00:09:36.061 --> 00:09:39.360
<v Speaker 1>investment all by buying shares on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

162
00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.560
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

163
00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>the impressive run that the snp 500 has </v>
<v Speaker 1>had over the last nine years?</v>

164
00:09:47.161 --> 00:09:47.994
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's precisely that enormous capital </v>

165
00:09:49.861 --> 00:09:50.694
<v Speaker 1>flow arriving every year to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States that allows americans to consume </v>

166
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.643
<v Speaker 1>more than they produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which despite in carrying commercial </v>

167
00:09:57.841 --> 00:10:00.510
<v Speaker 1>deficits for more than 40 consecutive </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

168
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.403
<v Speaker 1>has led the country to practically </v>
<v Speaker 1>always find employments and record </v>

169
00:10:04.291 --> 00:10:06.600
<v Speaker 1>levels of exports and industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

170
00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Considering tHat we can understand </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like this,</v>

171
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:12.750
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Japan in the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

172
00:10:12.751 --> 00:10:15.030
<v Speaker 1>and the two thousands or China in recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

173
00:10:15.090 --> 00:10:15.923
<v Speaker 1>countries that invest heavily in the New</v>
<v Speaker 1>York real estate market also tend to </v>

174
00:10:18.751 --> 00:10:21.600
<v Speaker 1>have a massive trade surplus with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

175
00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.030
<v Speaker 1>Conrad puts sierra,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a reporter at the real deal.</v>

176
00:10:24.090 --> 00:10:24.923
<v Speaker 1>Basically thanks to the capital that </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes from abroad to the United States </v>

177
00:10:27.541 --> 00:10:30.300
<v Speaker 1>can afford to consume more than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces,</v>

178
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:32.820
<v Speaker 1>so in addition to exporting goods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>services,</v>

179
00:10:32.821 --> 00:10:36.600
<v Speaker 1>the United States also export's </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial securities.</v>

180
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:38.100
<v Speaker 1>This is the key,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>

181
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:38.963
<v Speaker 1>does this need that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fiscal deficits combi reduced </v>

182
00:10:41.340 --> 00:10:42.180
<v Speaker 1>actually not at all.</v>

183
00:10:49.110 --> 00:10:50.820
<v Speaker 1>How to decrease the commercial</v>

184
00:10:51.210 --> 00:10:52.043
<v Speaker 4>set.</v>

185
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:53.943
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sometimes things aren't as they seem at </v>

186
00:10:56.261 --> 00:10:57.094
<v Speaker 1>fest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a trade deficit doesn't have to </v>

187
00:10:58.661 --> 00:11:00.010
<v Speaker 1>be bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

188
00:11:00.011 --> 00:11:03.970
<v Speaker 1>the ultimate economic objective must be </v>
<v Speaker 1>to improve living conditions.</v>

189
00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.080
<v Speaker 1>That is the ability to consume more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the better goods and services.</v>

190
00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bulky and continuing trade deficits.</v>

191
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:17.210
<v Speaker 1>It can have some drawbacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

192
00:11:17.540 --> 00:11:22.220
<v Speaker 1>assumes more risk or risk that capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>will stop flowing towards the country,</v>

193
00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:25.220
<v Speaker 1>which could lead to a huge crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for another,</v>

194
00:11:25.250 --> 00:11:26.083
<v Speaker 1>it favors debt growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country flooded with money from </v>

195
00:11:27.921 --> 00:11:28.754
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means abundant and cheap money and </v>

196
00:11:30.980 --> 00:11:31.813
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't want money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's continue with the key question </v>

197
00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:34.874
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can Donald Trump decrease the us </v>

198
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:38.420
<v Speaker 1>trade deficit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

199
00:11:38.421 --> 00:11:39.254
<v Speaker 1>there are mainly three options too that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we should set aside and it's one that's </v>

200
00:11:43.011 --> 00:11:43.844
<v Speaker 1>highly recommend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those we did recommends would be either </v>

201
00:11:48.300 --> 00:11:49.133
<v Speaker 1>agreeing to devalue the dollar and stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>it from being the hegemonic currency of </v>

202
00:11:52.561 --> 00:11:53.394
<v Speaker 1>the world with the federal reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So importance would be much more </v>

203
00:11:55.691 --> 00:11:58.940
<v Speaker 1>expensive and nobody would want to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>their money to thiS couNtry or the u.</v>

204
00:11:58.941 --> 00:12:01.300
<v Speaker 1>S could restrict the caPital coming from</v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>

205
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:02.860
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through taxes.</v>

206
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that in the long run is also going to be</v>

207
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:06.064
<v Speaker 1>a disaster</v>

208
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.030
<v Speaker 1>because the other option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that we'd recommend is consuming</v>

209
00:12:12.031 --> 00:12:12.864
<v Speaker 1>less,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saving more favoring productive </v>

210
00:12:14.431 --> 00:12:15.264
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way fewer foreign lines would be </v>

211
00:12:16.891 --> 00:12:17.724
<v Speaker 1>demanded and much more wealth would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated so that it's in percentage </v>

212
00:12:20.881 --> 00:12:24.180
<v Speaker 1>terms over the gdp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trade deficits would be much smaller.</v>

213
00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.940
<v Speaker 1>And to achieve this goal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping the government's growing fiscal</v>

214
00:12:26.941 --> 00:12:29.400
<v Speaker 1>hold would be a fantastic idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But trump,</v>

215
00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:32.100
<v Speaker 1>despite what he's saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going in the opposite direction,</v>

216
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.993
<v Speaker 1>it would also be a fantastic option to </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow american companies to fill the </v>

217
00:12:35.971 --> 00:12:36.804
<v Speaker 1>nearly 6 million vacant jobs that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north american economy suffers from </v>

218
00:12:39.871 --> 00:12:42.840
<v Speaker 1>today by bringing in professionals from </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad.</v>

219
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:46.643
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionist policies don't work first </v>

220
00:12:48.541 --> 00:12:49.374
<v Speaker 1>because all the other countries tend to </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to tariffs with their own </v>

221
00:12:52.171 --> 00:12:53.750
<v Speaker 1>tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which reduces imports,</v>

222
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:54.683
<v Speaker 1>but also exports and most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the increased costs led by </v>

223
00:12:57.841 --> 00:13:01.170
<v Speaker 1>terrorists make the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 1>less attractive country to invest in,</v>

224
00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.750
<v Speaker 1>and that's in the longterm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really bad thing.</v>

225
00:13:06.390 --> 00:13:07.223
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the strongest proof that american </v>

226
00:13:08.971 --> 00:13:13.320
<v Speaker 1>companies need to be open to the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>is found in the trump family itself.</v>

227
00:13:13.350 --> 00:13:16.080
<v Speaker 1>See ivanka trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president's daughter and white house</v>

228
00:13:16.081 --> 00:13:16.914
<v Speaker 1>special advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has just closed her clothing and </v>

229
00:13:18.931 --> 00:13:19.764
<v Speaker 1>accessories brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ivanka made this decision after </v>

230
00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.313
<v Speaker 1>suffering a steep drop in sales and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge amount of criticism for some </v>

231
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:28.590
<v Speaker 1>alleged contradictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you know why she was criticized?</v>

232
