1
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.660
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic People's Republic of Korea.</v>

2
00:00:10.661 --> 00:00:13.300
<v Speaker 1>The only country in the wells named </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite say,</v>

3
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:16.600
<v Speaker 1>ironically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you may know it's better as North Korea,</v>

4
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.130
<v Speaker 1>it sounds democratic as they come </v>
<v Speaker 1>through,</v>

5
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.973
<v Speaker 1>ruled by the same family for 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can be the head of state has been </v>

6
00:00:22.001 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Speaker 1>inherited through three generations of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kim family and Kim Il Sung,</v>

7
00:00:26.501 --> 00:00:27.334
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il ams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Kim Jong own ends in keeping with </v>

8
00:00:30.551 --> 00:00:31.384
<v Speaker 1>this publicly democratic tradition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader of North Korea is called not </v>

9
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.890
<v Speaker 1>president or not king,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but supremely supremely up.</v>

10
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:40.620
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like any normal democracy.</v>

11
00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:45.953
<v Speaker 1>So welcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We really sat on North Korea that you </v>

12
00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.310
<v Speaker 1>haven't had before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:49.311 --> 00:00:50.144
<v Speaker 1>it is one of the most brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships in the whole wells when </v>

14
00:00:52.501 --> 00:00:53.334
<v Speaker 1>mass torture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>execution and extreme poverty are </v>

15
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now you might ask,</v>

16
00:00:57.531 --> 00:00:58.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why did we cast so much about this </v>

17
00:00:59.241 --> 00:01:00.021
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:01:00.021 --> 00:01:03.560
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is as simple as </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear bombs.</v>

19
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.513
<v Speaker 1>This is a country that is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>officially at war with South Korea and </v>

20
00:01:07.341 --> 00:01:12.080
<v Speaker 1>it makes a pastime of threatening Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the US with nuclear annihilation.</v>

21
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.093
<v Speaker 1>And while that might have sounded </v>
<v Speaker 1>farfetched at one point in time with </v>

22
00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 1>nuclear tests happening almost every </v>
<v Speaker 1>other year,</v>

23
00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.270
<v Speaker 1>people are starting to take a little old</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim,</v>

24
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.470
<v Speaker 1>a bit more serious</v>

25
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.730
<v Speaker 2>sleep.</v>

26
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.970
<v Speaker 1>You still might wonder if North Korea is</v>
<v Speaker 1>that dangerous?</v>

27
00:01:29.971 --> 00:01:31.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why isn't anyone stopping them?</v>

28
00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.903
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they actually tried basically every </v>

29
00:01:34.801 --> 00:01:38.520
<v Speaker 1>sanction you could think of hasn't been </v>
<v Speaker 1>thrown at North Korea bus.</v>

30
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:39.383
<v Speaker 1>Instead of that financial pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing reform North Korea has just had </v>

31
00:01:42.751 --> 00:01:43.584
<v Speaker 1>it's diplomats selling meth out of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>embassies well worldwide to shortlist </v>

32
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.940
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

33
00:01:47.941 --> 00:01:50.970
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That on North Korean embassies and two,</v>

34
00:01:50.971 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>yes indeed they were selling drugs out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>

35
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.550
<v Speaker 1>But there's one country that still calls</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>

36
00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

37
00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.580
<v Speaker 1>And that country is China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even have a treaty called the Sino,</v>

38
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:05.250
<v Speaker 1>North Korea and mutual aid and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cooperation.</v>

39
00:02:05.251 --> 00:02:06.084
<v Speaker 1>Friendship Treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and North Korea are as close to </v>

40
00:02:11.411 --> 00:02:13.600
<v Speaker 1>each other as lips are two teeth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

41
00:02:13.601 --> 00:02:14.434
<v Speaker 1>And to a lesser extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia have been the only things </v>

42
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.434
<v Speaker 1>propping up the North Korean regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that must give China a lot of sway </v>

43
00:02:20.921 --> 00:02:21.754
<v Speaker 1>over the Kim Jong Rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that's what the international </v>

44
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:24.724
<v Speaker 1>community thought that south China came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be seen as the only country in the </v>

45
00:02:27.521 --> 00:02:32.521
<v Speaker 1>world could turn in order to reign in </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea's nuclear ambitions as well,</v>

46
00:02:32.921 --> 00:02:33.754
<v Speaker 1>not so fast because things are changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>in China is starting to get a rather </v>

47
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:39.150
<v Speaker 1>annoyed at that little brothers Tom </v>
<v Speaker 1>foolery.</v>

48
00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.193
<v Speaker 1>So the question today is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's behind the cooling relationship </v>

49
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:47.363
<v Speaker 1>between China and North Korea and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences could this have on the </v>

50
00:02:50.821 --> 00:02:51.654
<v Speaker 1>future of the country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joining us today to answer these </v>

51
00:02:53.551 --> 00:02:56.520
<v Speaker 1>questions is the biggest China expert on</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube.</v>

52
00:02:56.521 --> 00:02:58.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are talking about Chris Chapple,</v>

53
00:02:58.651 --> 00:03:00.610
<v Speaker 1>the host of China or uncensored</v>

54
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 3>Hello Simon and hello to all our friends</v>
<v Speaker 3>at visual politic.</v>

55
00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 3>So relationship between these two </v>
<v Speaker 3>communists.</v>

56
00:03:05.561 --> 00:03:06.394
<v Speaker 3>Brothers have deteriorated so much in </v>
<v Speaker 3>China and North Korea are in the middle </v>

57
00:03:09.731 --> 00:03:10.564
<v Speaker 3>of a war of work.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Basically China said that it would work </v>

58
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:16.384
<v Speaker 3>with the evil imperialists.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know the US do combat North Korea's </v>

59
00:03:20.351 --> 00:03:21.184
<v Speaker 3>nuclear program.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Then North Korean state run media </v>

60
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.214
<v Speaker 3>responded that China should really think</v>
<v Speaker 3>about how it's reckless act of chopping </v>

61
00:03:27.821 --> 00:03:28.654
<v Speaker 3>down the pillar of North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>China relations could have grave </v>

62
00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.823
<v Speaker 3>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then Johnny state run media </v>

63
00:03:34.571 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 3>responded with a not so subtle threat to</v>
<v Speaker 3>end their alliance.</v>

64
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.963
<v Speaker 1>So why is that the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they stabbing each other in the </v>

65
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:41.154
<v Speaker 1>back?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're going to have a look at that </v>

66
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:42.714
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China North Korea showing that ends up </v>

67
00:03:48.311 --> 00:03:51.130
<v Speaker 1>North Korea really make the perfect best</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends.</v>

68
00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.320
<v Speaker 1>They have much in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They share a border.</v>

69
00:03:53.321 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>They both had communist uprisings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ams,</v>

70
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:58.630
<v Speaker 1>they have installed leaders who have </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical views of Marxism.</v>

71
00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>The People's Republic of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends of the Democratic People's Republic</v>

72
00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:03.393
<v Speaker 1>of Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really all like the Quintin Tarantino </v>

73
00:04:04.661 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 1>and Robert Rodriguez on international </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

74
00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:09.910
<v Speaker 1>Especially like if you're doing a movie </v>
<v Speaker 1>or something.</v>

75
00:04:09.911 --> 00:04:10.744
<v Speaker 1>Doing it with Robert is just the idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>that that's a year I get to hang out </v>

76
00:04:13.481 --> 00:04:14.400
<v Speaker 1>with Robert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now</v>

77
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:17.380
<v Speaker 3>China does more than just give North </v>
<v Speaker 3>Korea financial aid.</v>

78
00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:18.333
<v Speaker 3>Jen has also made big loans of the North</v>
<v Speaker 3>Korean regime so they can build </v>

79
00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:21.544
<v Speaker 3>railroads and highways and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>pretty forgiving when p young can't pay </v>

80
00:04:24.671 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 3>back its debt.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And then there's oil.</v>

81
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:29.253
<v Speaker 3>For decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>China was the main source of dino juice </v>

82
00:04:31.541 --> 00:04:34.120
<v Speaker 3>to North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's military</v>

83
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.283
<v Speaker 2>great</v>

84
00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:39.523
<v Speaker 1>help train North Korean hackers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hackers who've now become a threat to </v>

85
00:04:43.011 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 1>the international community,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including China.</v>

86
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.130
<v Speaker 1>What does Beijing get in exchange?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

87
00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:52.400
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is a cheap labor paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

88
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:56.030
<v Speaker 1>in many products with the made in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>labels should actually say,</v>

89
00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 1>made in DPR.</v>

90
00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.033
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

91
00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:03.390
<v Speaker 1>brilliant sportswear brand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rip Curl made a public apology this week</v>

92
00:05:03.391 --> 00:05:04.224
<v Speaker 1>afterward emerged that some of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>skier had been made in one of North </v>

93
00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:08.163
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stayed on factor,</v>

94
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute because things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to change.</v>

95
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:15.293
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese Communist Party today is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little less interested in the global </v>

96
00:05:18.121 --> 00:05:18.954
<v Speaker 1>spread of communism and then there's one</v>
<v Speaker 1>more interested in becoming a global </v>

97
00:05:22.021 --> 00:05:24.930
<v Speaker 1>superpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is well,</v>

98
00:05:24.931 --> 00:05:25.764
<v Speaker 1>very rarely cramping China's style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine how hard it is to be cool with </v>

99
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:29.604
<v Speaker 1>America when you're good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buddy North Korea keeps threatening to </v>

100
00:05:31.561 --> 00:05:35.220
<v Speaker 1>blow them up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the end of the story.</v>

101
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:36.113
<v Speaker 1>Sixty years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and North Korea were pretty </v>

102
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:40.410
<v Speaker 1>similar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today things are quite different.</v>

103
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.353
<v Speaker 4>Terrorists came to see closely is the </v>
<v Speaker 4>misery experienced by the North Korean </v>

104
00:05:44.291 --> 00:05:47.420
<v Speaker 4>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I'm not old,</v>

105
00:05:47.421 --> 00:05:48.254
<v Speaker 4>but I feel like what I can see over </v>
<v Speaker 4>there is similar to the very difficult </v>

106
00:05:50.961 --> 00:05:52.670
<v Speaker 4>time that our nation had in the past,</v>

107
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:53.673
<v Speaker 1>a loss of North Korean citizens would do</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever it takes in order to cross the </v>

108
00:05:57.321 --> 00:05:58.154
<v Speaker 1>Chinese borden and Beijing is scared of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what could become a refugee crisis </v>

109
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 1>similar to that of Syria.</v>

110
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.333
<v Speaker 3>If this wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Pyongyang's diplomacy hasn't been all </v>

111
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:07.724
<v Speaker 3>that diplomatic with its own allies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Here's a little snub courtesy of Kim </v>

112
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 3>Jong Un in 2015</v>

113
00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.373
<v Speaker 5>in all female North Korean pop band </v>
<v Speaker 5>formed by leader Kim Jong Un abruptly </v>

114
00:06:23.001 --> 00:06:26.640
<v Speaker 5>canceled a Beijing concert on Saturday </v>
<v Speaker 5>and headed back home to Pyongyang,</v>

115
00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.313
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately it February 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>became the breaking points for this </v>

116
00:06:37.251 --> 00:06:37.970
<v Speaker 1>friendship.</v>

117
00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:38.803
<v Speaker 3>North Korea launching some ballistic </v>
<v Speaker 3>missiles or conducting some nuclear </v>

118
00:06:41.331 --> 00:06:42.164
<v Speaker 3>tests is nothing new,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what is do is the degree to which </v>

119
00:06:45.831 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 3>China is willing to criticize it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is happening at a time when Chinese</v>

120
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:50.354
<v Speaker 3>leader Xi Jingping is trying to improve </v>
<v Speaker 3>his relationship with the United States </v>

121
00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:55.240
<v Speaker 3>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>according to young.</v>

122
00:06:55.520 --> 00:07:00.520
<v Speaker 3>This is a stab in the back,</v>
<v Speaker 3>triggered the war of words between these</v>

123
00:07:04.231 --> 00:07:08.100
<v Speaker 3>two countries with state run media in </v>
<v Speaker 3>both countries criticizing the other,</v>

124
00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>but again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the end of the story.</v>

125
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.570
<v Speaker 1>Remember those Chinese trains?</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korean hackers,</v>

126
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:15.610
<v Speaker 1>there's allegedly hit several Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>studios two years ago.</v>

127
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you lay down with dogs,</v>

128
00:07:17.711 --> 00:07:20.200
<v Speaker 1>don't be surprised if you wake up with </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleas</v>

129
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 5>called ransomware attacks that began </v>
<v Speaker 5>Friday.</v>

130
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:29.630
<v Speaker 5>Have struck China hard.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If North Korea is responsible,</v>

131
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.523
<v Speaker 5>even unintentionally,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it wouldn't be the first known attempt </v>

132
00:07:32.631 --> 00:07:36.500
<v Speaker 5>by Pyong Young to digitally Pilfer </v>
<v Speaker 5>China's coffers at such a scale.</v>

133
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.570
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying,</v>

134
00:07:37.580 --> 00:07:38.413
<v Speaker 1>keeping things the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is about to lose their </v>

135
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:41.654
<v Speaker 1>biggest ally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only country willing to defend them </v>

136
00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.773
<v Speaker 1>in case of war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a war even if just for </v>

137
00:07:46.881 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>propaganda reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot of people would love to start.</v>

138
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:52.910
<v Speaker 6>Hey,</v>

139
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:55.903
<v Speaker 1>trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come in.</v>

140
00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

141
00:07:57.281 --> 00:07:57.941
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

142
00:07:57.941 --> 00:07:58.774
<v Speaker 1>This is quite a story and need some </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to become a true visual politic </v>

143
00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>

144
00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.860
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>

145
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.053
<v Speaker 5>Russia has already taken over the supply</v>
<v Speaker 5>of jet fuel to North Korea after China </v>

146
00:08:13.001 --> 00:08:13.834
<v Speaker 5>halted exports two years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 5>According to the industry sources in </v>

147
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:16.600
<v Speaker 5>China,</v>

148
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.410
<v Speaker 3>Russia and North Korea also have a lot </v>
<v Speaker 3>of things in common apart from sharing a</v>

149
00:08:20.411 --> 00:08:22.210
<v Speaker 3>border.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They both have strong,</v>

150
00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:27.240
<v Speaker 3>attractive and manly lead.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Both countries.</v>

151
00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:32.093
<v Speaker 3>Human rights are considered optional.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia and North Korea just started a </v>

152
00:08:34.711 --> 00:08:35.544
<v Speaker 3>ferry service that connects their two </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries to Russian companies can be </v>

153
00:08:38.521 --> 00:08:41.970
<v Speaker 3>regularly stock with a North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 3>slave workforce.</v>

154
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 3>Does that mean Putin and Kim are now </v>
<v Speaker 3>besties?</v>

155
00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:45.420
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so fast</v>

156
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>because Kim Jong Un has a rather funny </v>
<v Speaker 1>concept of truth.</v>

157
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:50.323
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

158
00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:54.650
<v Speaker 5>rhea launches a missile near Russians.</v>

159
00:08:56.740 --> 00:08:57.481
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

160
00:08:57.481 --> 00:08:58.314
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Un dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is really not the way you made </v>

161
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:03.210
<v Speaker 1>friends and as you might imagine with </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like this,</v>

162
00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Russia may not be too big to become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>north.</v>

163
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>Korea is unconditional allied and so for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first time in its history,</v>

164
00:09:09.781 --> 00:09:10.614
<v Speaker 1>the most hated country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has run out of allies and this is </v>

165
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:15.330
<v Speaker 1>where donald trump's steps into the vic </v>
<v Speaker 1>trap.</v>

166
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:16.283
<v Speaker 3>We have a big problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have somebody that is not doing the </v>

167
00:09:18.871 --> 00:09:19.704
<v Speaker 3>right thing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and that's going to be my </v>

168
00:09:21.151 --> 00:09:22.110
<v Speaker 3>responsibility.</v>

169
00:09:22.150 --> 00:09:22.983
<v Speaker 1>This comes at a time when China is </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to work on a new trade deal with </v>

170
00:09:26.261 --> 00:09:27.094
<v Speaker 1>the United States at the same time that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is facing a lot of </v>

171
00:09:29.861 --> 00:09:30.490
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>

172

174
00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:39.660
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for North Korea to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve his image in the United States?</v>

175
00:09:39.810 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Could this be the end of the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean dictatorship?</v>
