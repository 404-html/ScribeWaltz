1
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't seem that lately a lot of movies</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been shot in London.</v>

2
00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.530
<v Speaker 1>One example is bridget Jones's baby,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a movie from the Bridget Jones's soccer,</v>

3
00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:16.364
<v Speaker 1>which I might've seen just look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyscrapers in the backgrounds of that </v>

4
00:00:20.211 --> 00:00:23.150
<v Speaker 1>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those were simply not there in the first</v>

5
00:00:23.151 --> 00:00:24.580
<v Speaker 1>movie of the saga.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

6
00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.790
<v Speaker 1>London skyline has changed dramatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last 10 years alone,</v>

7
00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:29.713
<v Speaker 1>and this is pretty surprising because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about an emerging </v>

8
00:00:31.731 --> 00:00:33.470
<v Speaker 1>economies like China or</v>

9
00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 2>actually</v>

10
00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.823
<v Speaker 1>the overall economy in the UK as an all </v>
<v Speaker 1>performance that well over the last few </v>

11
00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.911
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

12
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 1>the London is another world entirely </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

13
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>It is one of the four fastest growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitals on the planet almost growing at</v>

14
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:51.874
<v Speaker 1>the same level as Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their population has increased by 50 </v>

15
00:00:55.331 --> 00:01:00.331
<v Speaker 1>percent in the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly odd on a continental Europe</v>

16
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:09.370
<v Speaker 1>where all countries are seeing overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>population decline.</v>

17
00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.273
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>London has 3 million more inhabitants </v>

18
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.500
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the finance wells,</v>

19
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.460
<v Speaker 1>London is now more important than New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York City itself.</v>

20
00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.353
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly has happened in London that has </v>

21
00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>caused this massive success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:25.633
<v Speaker 1>that's the question we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>answering in today is visual politic </v>

23
00:01:28.041 --> 00:01:28.874
<v Speaker 1>video ration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United Kingdom has always been a </v>

24
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:37.720
<v Speaker 1>country of immigrants and the London was</v>
<v Speaker 1>always the main destination.</v>

25
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last decade,</v>

26
00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:40.353
<v Speaker 1>immigration has apps and the sky </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocketed after Poland's became a member </v>

27
00:01:44.291 --> 00:01:49.000
<v Speaker 1>of the European Union in 2004.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I lots of polls easily moved from Poland</v>

28
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>to London because there was no visa </v>
<v Speaker 1>required.</v>

29
00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:56.653
<v Speaker 1>The same happens when Bulgaria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romania became part of the European </v>

30
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:00.793
<v Speaker 1>Union in 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This created a whole new influx of </v>

31
00:02:03.531 --> 00:02:07.070
<v Speaker 1>immigrants adding to those already there</v>
<v Speaker 1>from India and Pakistan.</v>

32
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.360
<v Speaker 1>These European immigrants typically have</v>
<v Speaker 1>higher education and university degrees.</v>

33
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.253
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in London has a one point 7 </v>

34
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.923
<v Speaker 1>million highly skilled workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While New York has one point 6 million </v>

35
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.883
<v Speaker 1>immigrants are not only working the jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>that British people don't want to do </v>

36
00:02:21.831 --> 00:02:22.664
<v Speaker 1>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead they are coming to the country </v>

37
00:02:24.021 --> 00:02:27.920
<v Speaker 1>and starting their own businesses or </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting hired in the high tech sector.</v>

38
00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.680
<v Speaker 1>But Tom started his marketing business </v>
<v Speaker 1>four years after arriving from Warsaw.</v>

39
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.950
<v Speaker 1>He now employs six people and four of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them are British.</v>

40
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>That's companies are far more than just </v>
<v Speaker 1>job creating machines or economic growth</v>

41
00:02:43.421 --> 00:02:44.254
<v Speaker 1>engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact that London has more educated </v>

42
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:48.310
<v Speaker 1>people means more bars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more exhibitions,</v>

43
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:49.720
<v Speaker 1>more culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>

44
00:02:49.721 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>it has more of all the things that make </v>
<v Speaker 1>a city look cool.</v>

45
00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:53.560
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

46
00:02:53.561 --> 00:02:56.440
<v Speaker 1>where's the best known Peruvian </v>
<v Speaker 1>restaurants outside of Peru?</v>

47
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.393
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to all of the gastronomical </v>

48
00:02:58.511 --> 00:03:00.290
<v Speaker 1>guides,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's restaurant called civic j,</v>

49
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:01.183
<v Speaker 1>which of course is located in London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how London has created a </v>

50
00:03:10.881 --> 00:03:14.360
<v Speaker 1>virtuous cycle that has attracted more </v>
<v Speaker 1>and more people.</v>

51
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.253
<v Speaker 1>This is why in 2000 inmates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the financial crisis hits many </v>

52
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.970
<v Speaker 1>Spaniards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese and Italians,</v>

53
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.260
<v Speaker 1>who wanted to leave their countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saw London as the main destination.</v>

54
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.540
<v Speaker 1>It was more than just a good place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>find a job.</v>

55
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.740
<v Speaker 1>It was a cool place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The myths,</v>

56
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.030
<v Speaker 1>this is something that economists school</v>
<v Speaker 1>the network effect.</v>

57
00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.190
<v Speaker 1>The more people and companies that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>have,</v>

58
00:03:34.191 --> 00:03:36.950
<v Speaker 1>the easier it is to attract highly </v>
<v Speaker 1>skilled immigrants.</v>

59
00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:40.910
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new generation of coders,</v>

60
00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.200
<v Speaker 2>bankers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and financial wizards are remaking,</v>

61
00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.740
<v Speaker 2>is extraordinary place.</v>

62
00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2010 over 1000 startups have been </v>

63
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:52.224
<v Speaker 1>created in London every single year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a moment because there's </v>

64
00:03:56.701 --> 00:03:57.534
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

65
00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

66
00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:01.543
<v Speaker 1>city of London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the skyscrapers that you see here </v>

67
00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:04.723
<v Speaker 1>are concentrated in a single area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an area and not bigger than a </v>

68
00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:11.270
<v Speaker 1>square mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it is known as the city of London or</v>

69
00:04:11.271 --> 00:04:12.800
<v Speaker 1>just with the city?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

70
00:04:12.801 --> 00:04:13.634
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand we do have London and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then also on the other hand we have the </v>

71
00:04:16.851 --> 00:04:17.684
<v Speaker 1>city of London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have London essentially works like </v>

72
00:04:26.341 --> 00:04:28.770
<v Speaker 1>it's own country within the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom.</v>

73
00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:29.693
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we normally say for Britain is made </v>

74
00:04:31.351 --> 00:04:33.540
<v Speaker 1>up of four nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>England,</v>

75
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:35.430
<v Speaker 1>Wales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland and Northern Ireland,</v>

76
00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.760
<v Speaker 1>but really this is not exactly true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

77
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.850
<v Speaker 1>we should really add a fifth one and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the city of London.</v>

78
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.900
<v Speaker 1>The city has its own laws and has its </v>
<v Speaker 1>own</v>

79
00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:45.743
<v Speaker 3>mayor.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The city is the financial center of </v>

80
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 3>Great Britain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>About 7,000</v>

81
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:53.600
<v Speaker 3>people live in this city,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but each day 300,000</v>

82
00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:57.600
<v Speaker 3>come to work and its banks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>brokerage firms and insurance companies.</v>

83
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.360
<v Speaker 1>London's mayor is the man we're showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the screen now.</v>

84
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.920
<v Speaker 1>His name is Sidique Khan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the city of London has its own Lord,</v>

85
00:05:04.921 --> 00:05:08.040
<v Speaker 1>mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and his name is Jeffrey months events.</v>

86
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>One of the characteristics over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>

87
00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.080
<v Speaker 1>also known as the square mile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the during elections,</v>

88
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:16.290
<v Speaker 1>both citizens and companies have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>right to vote.</v>

89
00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.183
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Unilever has its headquarters in the </v>

90
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.620
<v Speaker 1>square mile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore when elections come,</v>

91
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 1>Unilever is allowed to.</v>

92
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.053
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

93
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:31.303
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does Unilever get the same voting power </v>

94
00:05:34.251 --> 00:05:35.720
<v Speaker 1>as a smaller company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

95
00:05:35.721 --> 00:05:36.554
<v Speaker 1>the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a number of votes a company </v>

96
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:39.434
<v Speaker 1>gets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depends on how many people say </v>

97
00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:45.800
<v Speaker 1>employment in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

98
00:05:49.941 --> 00:05:50.774
<v Speaker 1>the music that is accompanying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video that you were listening to right </v>

99
00:05:53.091 --> 00:05:55.700
<v Speaker 1>now is by a band called the forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>voice.</v>

100
00:05:55.730 --> 00:05:59.180
<v Speaker 1>There a pop rock bands from to you sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>us that music to use in this video.</v>

101
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.220
<v Speaker 1>And if you like it and you would like to</v>
<v Speaker 1>hear more from them,</v>

102
00:06:01.221 --> 00:06:02.054
<v Speaker 1>it please do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check out the links in the description </v>

103
00:06:03.081 --> 00:06:03.914
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>

104
00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:16.403
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering whether </v>

105
00:06:17.581 --> 00:06:21.450
<v Speaker 1>the city of London is a fiscal haven and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is no.</v>

106
00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:22.373
<v Speaker 1>All across the UK taxes off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fairly similar to what is true is that </v>

107
00:06:25.801 --> 00:06:26.634
<v Speaker 1>the square mile does have more business </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly policies than the rest of the </v>

108
00:06:30.301 --> 00:06:31.650
<v Speaker 1>UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

109
00:06:31.651 --> 00:06:32.484
<v Speaker 1>that the development laws are much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>free and open than the rest of the </v>

110
00:06:34.951 --> 00:06:35.784
<v Speaker 1>country and this is why they're all more</v>
<v Speaker 1>skyscrapers bought when it comes to </v>

111
00:06:38.431 --> 00:06:41.490
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are not a haven whatsoever,</v>

112
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:42.413
<v Speaker 1>but it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on just a minute because the city </v>

113
00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:44.034
<v Speaker 1>does play a really important role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is because the main task of the </v>

114
00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:47.784
<v Speaker 1>Lord mayor is do traveled around the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world and promote London as a great </v>

115
00:06:51.301 --> 00:06:52.134
<v Speaker 1>place for doing</v>

116
00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:53.033
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

117
00:06:55.630 --> 00:06:56.463
<v Speaker 4>Mayor of the city of London,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Alderman Alan Yarrow is believe that </v>

118
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.303
<v Speaker 4>business delegation to Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>helping to make sure London and the UK </v>

119
00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:06.503
<v Speaker 4>remained the regional partner of choice </v>
<v Speaker 4>when it comes to financial and </v>

120
00:07:09.751 --> 00:07:10.920
<v Speaker 4>professional services.</v>

121
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:14.763
<v Speaker 1>So you went away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can say that London has its own </v>

122
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:17.164
<v Speaker 1>marketing departments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>showcasing all of the benefits of doing </v>

123
00:07:19.511 --> 00:07:21.430
<v Speaker 1>business there to the rest of the world</v>

124
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:23.960
<v Speaker 2>business</v>

125
00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:24.793
<v Speaker 1>concentration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The US economy is divided among </v>

126
00:07:26.721 --> 00:07:28.340
<v Speaker 1>different cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

127
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.270
<v Speaker 1>politics is centered in Washington DC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finance is in New York City.</v>

128
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.143
<v Speaker 1>Entertainment is in Los Angeles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and technology is centered in San </v>

129
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.603
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same happens in Germany where you </v>

130
00:07:38.661 --> 00:07:40.790
<v Speaker 1>have cities like Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankfurt,</v>

131
00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:42.010
<v Speaker 1>and Munich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>andover.</v>

132
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:43.730
<v Speaker 1>In Spain you have Barcelona,</v>

133
00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.073
<v Speaker 2>correct.</v>

134
00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 1>On the other hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain has London as well,</v>

135
00:07:49.451 --> 00:07:50.284
<v Speaker 1>just London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other larger cities are far less </v>

136
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:54.430
<v Speaker 1>important to the country's economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

137
00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.790
<v Speaker 1>London generates every one in five </v>
<v Speaker 1>pounds.</v>

138
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 1>In the British economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this city,</v>

139
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:02.350
<v Speaker 1>you will find all of the major </v>
<v Speaker 1>government institutions,</v>

140
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:04.390
<v Speaker 1>the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technological center,</v>

141
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:05.470
<v Speaker 1>the fashion center,</v>

142
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:06.423
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>

143
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:11.603
<v Speaker 1>While the amount of tax generated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>London increased by 25 percent in real </v>

144
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:16.874
<v Speaker 1>terms between 2005 and 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manchester's fax intake by only one </v>

145
00:08:22.341 --> 00:08:23.390
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:08:23.420 --> 00:08:24.253
<v Speaker 1>Birmingham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Glasgow and leads also significant </v>

147
00:08:27.261 --> 00:08:30.290
<v Speaker 1>decreases in their vaccine take and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>tool of this,</v>

148
00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.340
<v Speaker 1>we should add another really important </v>
<v Speaker 1>element and that's English.</v>

149
00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:35.263
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK has had a rather good </v>

150
00:08:37.041 --> 00:08:37.874
<v Speaker 1>relationship with the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well at least for the past two </v>

151
00:08:40.311 --> 00:08:43.430
<v Speaker 1>centuries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though there is no trade agreements</v>

152
00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:44.264
<v Speaker 1>between the two countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do have a lot of history in common </v>

153
00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.670
<v Speaker 1>and importantly they speak the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

154
00:08:54.860 --> 00:08:55.170
<v Speaker 2>List</v>

155
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.590
<v Speaker 1>fact that the United Kingdom</v>

156
00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.443
<v Speaker 5>is currently a part of the European </v>
<v Speaker 5>Union and so you can see why London has </v>

157
00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.583
<v Speaker 5>become the gateway for American </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies who want to do business in </v>

158
00:09:04.471 --> 00:09:06.110
<v Speaker 5>Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 5>What London does,</v>

159
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:06.973
<v Speaker 5>it is the capital of the euro and that </v>
<v Speaker 5>means that 70 percent of forex trading </v>

160
00:09:11.871 --> 00:09:14.480
<v Speaker 5>and all sorts of other over the counter </v>
<v Speaker 5>derivatives,</v>

161
00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:16.970
<v Speaker 5>all sorts of fancy stuff gets done </v>
<v Speaker 5>through London.</v>

162
00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:18.043
<v Speaker 5>Although the UK is not in the euro,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so there's a very difficult set of </v>

163
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:22.670
<v Speaker 5>negotiations coming up.</v>

164
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.413
<v Speaker 1>But now the obvious and big question is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be how is brexit going to </v>

165
00:09:33.081 --> 00:09:36.650
<v Speaker 1>affect London's growth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing is very clear and that's the.</v>

166
00:09:36.651 --> 00:09:37.484
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the British population </v>

167
00:09:38.721 --> 00:09:41.270
<v Speaker 1>once it the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave the European Union,</v>

168
00:09:41.510 --> 00:09:42.343
<v Speaker 1>London wasn't very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are our thoughts here at visual </v>

169
