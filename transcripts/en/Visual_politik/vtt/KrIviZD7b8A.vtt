1
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>November the 26th 2017 a hundred euros </v>

2
00:00:11.061 --> 00:00:14.010
<v Speaker 1>held elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some very peculiar elections,</v>

3
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.560
<v Speaker 1>even though millions of people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>called upon to vote that day.</v>

4
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.510
<v Speaker 1>Only one vote really counts and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end,</v>

5
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:19.373
<v Speaker 1>and that was the vote of the president's</v>
<v Speaker 1>one whole Ando Hernandez who decided to </v>

6
00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:25.390
<v Speaker 1>stay for another four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No nuts or what the polls said.</v>

7
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.700
<v Speaker 2>Joe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>look at Dana.</v>

8
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this president's Hernandez very probably</v>

9
00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:44.410
<v Speaker 1>just told himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

10
00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I like being president a lot.</v>

11
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:46.930
<v Speaker 1>So why leave?</v>

12
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.000
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

13
00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.833
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>protests due to what has obviously been </v>

14
00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.503
<v Speaker 1>a rigged election and assault on </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy have occurred quite </v>

15
00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.743
<v Speaker 1>frequently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras is a country that already </v>

16
00:00:56.981 --> 00:00:57.814
<v Speaker 1>suffers from the tragic consequences of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a social and political model full of </v>

17
00:01:00.941 --> 00:01:02.590
<v Speaker 1>corruption and violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How model,</v>

18
00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.453
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is so disastrous and dysfunctional </v>

19
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.733
<v Speaker 1>that it let Honduras to be the poorest </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in Latin America and the third </v>

20
00:01:09.581 --> 00:01:12.370
<v Speaker 1>most dangerous country in the world's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't presently at war.</v>

21
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.103
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>

22
00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.313
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras is a small tropical country </v>

23
00:01:21.821 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>with just over 9 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cases on a narrow strip of land that</v>

24
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>separates the Caribbean sea from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific Ocean.</v>

25
00:01:28.241 --> 00:01:29.074
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.423
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.230
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras is one of those places where we</v>

28
00:01:33.231 --> 00:01:36.050
<v Speaker 1>can find some of the most incredible </v>
<v Speaker 1>beaches in the world.</v>

29
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.640
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>

30
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.473
<v Speaker 1>Sandy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crystal clear waters and lots and lots </v>

31
00:01:40.371 --> 00:01:41.300
<v Speaker 1>of coconut trees.</v>

32
00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:43.270
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

33
00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>Sounds rather nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't it as I,</v>

34
00:01:45.501 --> 00:01:46.334
<v Speaker 1>fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking gangs and a political </v>

35
00:01:48.391 --> 00:01:49.224
<v Speaker 1>and economic elites have prioritized </v>
<v Speaker 1>above all plundering of a nation's </v>

36
00:01:52.231 --> 00:01:54.960
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have muddied and stains the reality</v>

37
00:01:54.961 --> 00:01:55.794
<v Speaker 1>of a country that could otherwise be </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe and possibly even be considered a </v>

38
00:01:59.131 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>true paradise here on earth.</v>

39
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.913
<v Speaker 4>Some people don't want to come here to </v>
<v Speaker 4>claim bodies because they don't want to </v>

40
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.784
<v Speaker 4>be associated with their family member </v>
<v Speaker 4>who ends up dead because here this gang </v>

41
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:11.334
<v Speaker 4>members come here to the medical </v>
<v Speaker 4>examiners office and they case out </v>

42
00:02:14.311 --> 00:02:15.144
<v Speaker 4>families to figure out who is next in </v>
<v Speaker 4>that family unit that they would be </v>

43
00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:19.794
<v Speaker 4>attacked.</v>

44
00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:25.453
<v Speaker 3>Let's,</v>

45
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.690
<v Speaker 1>you might be thinking right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean a small remote,</v>

46
00:02:27.691 --> 00:02:28.524
<v Speaker 1>poor country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just another drop in the ocean of </v>

47
00:02:31.201 --> 00:02:32.430
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said,</v>

48
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.360
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

49
00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.240
<v Speaker 1>because there's a lot more at work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

50
00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.893
<v Speaker 1>What would you think if I told you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we might be facing the first coup de ta </v>

51
00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.840
<v Speaker 1>supported by the trump administration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

52
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.920
<v Speaker 1>just check this out.</v>

53
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.833
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

54
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:55.133
<v Speaker 1>Fraud.</v>

55
00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 3>On Sunday,</v>

56
00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.000
<v Speaker 1>November the 26th 2017</v>

57
00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.833
<v Speaker 5>general elections were held in Honduras </v>
<v Speaker 5>and there were two major contenders for </v>

58
00:03:05.291 --> 00:03:06.124
<v Speaker 5>the presidency,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is the most important political </v>

59
00:03:07.721 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 5>position in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>On the one hands,</v>

60
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.590
<v Speaker 5>we've got president one Alando </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hernandez,</v>

61
00:03:11.591 --> 00:03:12.424
<v Speaker 5>who was widely supported by the </v>
<v Speaker 5>country's economic leadership and the </v>

62
00:03:15.161 --> 00:03:15.994
<v Speaker 5>international community,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he was aspiring to be reelected or </v>

63
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 5>reelection.</v>
<v Speaker 5>By the way,</v>

64
00:03:20.411 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 5>that was very controversial because in </v>
<v Speaker 5>principle,</v>

65
00:03:22.451 --> 00:03:23.284
<v Speaker 5>the country's constitution prevents it </v>
<v Speaker 5>under article 239 and article that was </v>

66
00:03:26.711 --> 00:03:27.544
<v Speaker 5>declared in applicable in 2015 by a </v>
<v Speaker 5>surprising and very controversial </v>

67
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 5>decision from the Supreme Court.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Now,</v>

68
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.873
<v Speaker 5>do bear in mind here that the supreme </v>
<v Speaker 5>court is in actuality controlled by the </v>

69
00:03:37.421 --> 00:03:38.254
<v Speaker 5>presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so maybe that might have had something </v>

70
00:03:39.791 --> 00:03:40.624
<v Speaker 5>to do with it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's just maybe is gay and Lasalla </v>

71
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:49.370
<v Speaker 5>constitutional to show me</v>

72
00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.773
<v Speaker 1>this is what article 239 set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a citizen has held the ownership of </v>

73
00:03:55.821 --> 00:03:56.654
<v Speaker 1>the executive power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she cannot be the president or </v>

74
00:03:59.031 --> 00:03:59.864
<v Speaker 1>designee.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Article two 39 of the Honduran </v>

75
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.021
<v Speaker 1>Constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

76
00:04:03.021 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador Nasralla,</v>

77
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:05.674
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Popular television presents that ran as </v>

78
00:04:07.131 --> 00:04:09.830
<v Speaker 1>a candidate for the center left parties </v>
<v Speaker 1>coalition,</v>

79
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.630
<v Speaker 1>the opposition alliance</v>

80
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.960
<v Speaker 5>slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think that is,</v>

81
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.870
<v Speaker 5>or or we didn't say yes that moment </v>
<v Speaker 5>though,</v>

82
00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 5>Latina Scitech,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever.</v>

83
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:26.320
<v Speaker 5>So even you must go amigo.</v>

84
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that in the initial vote </v>

85
00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:35.180
<v Speaker 1>counts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything pointed to Salvador.</v>

86
00:04:35.181 --> 00:04:36.014
<v Speaker 1>Nasralla is</v>

87
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.883
<v Speaker 3>sorry.</v>

88
00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:39.403
<v Speaker 1>With almost 60% of the votes counted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had a five point lead over the </v>

89
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:43.304
<v Speaker 1>president's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The advantage was so overwhelming that </v>

90
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:45.374
<v Speaker 1>the magistrates who formed the Honduras </v>
<v Speaker 1>Supreme Electoral Tribunal qualified </v>

91
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.980
<v Speaker 1>this lead as irreversible and </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurmountable.</v>

92
00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.200
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly the counting stopped,</v>

93
00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:57.050
<v Speaker 1>there was no additional information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we use a system?</v>

94
00:04:57.051 --> 00:04:59.900
<v Speaker 1>Simply collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New balance appeared and in the end,</v>

95
00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:00.823
<v Speaker 1>several days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electorial tribunal awarded a </v>

96
00:05:03.021 --> 00:05:06.680
<v Speaker 1>surprising victory to precedent one </v>
<v Speaker 1>Orlando Hernandez,</v>

97
00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:11.750
<v Speaker 5>one lieutenant [inaudible].</v>

98
00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.130
<v Speaker 1>Then when it's so many irregularities </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the organization of American States</v>

99
00:05:18.131 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>of self rejected the recounts and calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>for new elections.</v>

100
00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:21.983
<v Speaker 5>It's a good video.</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] Ella oil proponent </v>

101
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.470
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] he gets it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but he's,</v>

102
00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.310
<v Speaker 5>and the impulsivity that [inaudible]</v>

103
00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:37.810
<v Speaker 1>but that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One day before the elections,</v>

104
00:05:37.811 --> 00:05:38.644
<v Speaker 1>the economist published on its website </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he'd had a recording that proved </v>

105
00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:44.890
<v Speaker 1>the government was preparing to distort </v>
<v Speaker 1>the results of this</v>

106
00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:50.150
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 3>So the big</v>

107
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.753
<v Speaker 1>question now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

108
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.270
<v Speaker 1>was the election actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that is hard to say for sure,</v>

109
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say that the chances are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

110
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:02.443
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this is without mentioning the </v>

111
00:06:04.191 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>governments authoritarian behavior.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

112
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:09.530
<v Speaker 1>once the possibility of electoral fraud </v>
<v Speaker 1>was on the table,</v>

113
00:06:09.531 --> 00:06:12.830
<v Speaker 1>the opposition mobilized and organized </v>
<v Speaker 1>protest rallies.</v>

114
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.693
<v Speaker 1>They were peaceful at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the police didn't really seem to </v>

115
00:06:15.351 --> 00:06:16.184
<v Speaker 1>cap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still used as much force on the </v>

116
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:23.111
<v Speaker 1>protesters as they want it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

117
00:06:23.331 --> 00:06:24.164
<v Speaker 1>on the evening of Wednesday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 29th state forces fired tear gas at </v>

118
00:06:27.141 --> 00:06:30.290
<v Speaker 1>a rally of about a thousand people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>were peacefully awaiting the results.</v>

119
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.153
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this group there was even the </v>

120
00:06:31.881 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>opposition leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador Nasralla,</v>

121
00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:34.663
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't care that it was a peaceful </v>

122
00:06:35.511 --> 00:06:38.300
<v Speaker 1>demonstration or that they were children</v>
<v Speaker 1>and elderly people</v>

123
00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.173
<v Speaker 3>present.</v>

124
00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:54.093
<v Speaker 6>No</v>

125
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.443
<v Speaker 3>g</v>

126
00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:02.773
<v Speaker 1>even decreed a curfew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since then rallies have been put </v>

127
00:07:04.851 --> 00:07:09.830
<v Speaker 1>down with 30 people being killed and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 800 people being detained.</v>

128
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.693
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the evidence really does point to a </v>

129
00:07:11.841 --> 00:07:12.674
<v Speaker 1>rigged election followed by forceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression or simply to reinforce the </v>

130
00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:16.973
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>

131
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.840
<v Speaker 6>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Nadia.</v>

132
00:07:28.340 --> 00:07:29.173
<v Speaker 1>Now having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have several questions that need an </v>

133
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:34.100
<v Speaker 1>answer and it's clearly one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>who exactly is the president?</v>

134
00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:36.260
<v Speaker 1>Who is Juan Orlando Hernandez,</v>

135
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:43.053
<v Speaker 3>the president,</v>

136
00:07:46.580 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 1>two versions and they're really </v>
<v Speaker 1>different interpretations.</v>

137
00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:51.860
<v Speaker 1>The first is that of a leader with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong hands,</v>

138
00:07:51.861 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>but who can clearly rescue his country </v>
<v Speaker 1>from becoming a failed state.</v>

139
00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:58.970
<v Speaker 1>The second is that of an authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader involved in corruption and crime,</v>

140
00:07:59.010 --> 00:07:59.843
<v Speaker 1>a leader who was taking control of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's institutions and to managers </v>

141
00:08:02.511 --> 00:08:03.344
<v Speaker 1>them based on his own interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something we saw in the case of </v>

142
00:08:05.901 --> 00:08:07.970
<v Speaker 1>the Supreme Court and reelection.</v>

143
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:10.603
<v Speaker 2>Bang.</v>

144
00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:23.063
<v Speaker 1>The president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we will see in more detail in a </v>

145
00:08:23.961 --> 00:08:24.794
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the support of the United States of </v>

146
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.410
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among others,</v>

147
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:28.303
<v Speaker 1>and it'd be fair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must say that his mandate has had </v>

148
00:08:30.711 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>many dark times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also had some good ones.</v>

149
00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:34.550
<v Speaker 1>Let's start with these good ones.</v>

150
00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:42.390
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>

151
00:08:42.390 --> 00:08:43.223
<v Speaker 1>when Kwan Orlando Hernandez came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>power in 2013 on has had the highest </v>

152
00:08:46.741 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 1>homicide rates of a country that was not</v>
<v Speaker 1>at war.</v>

153
00:08:51.060 --> 00:08:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Every 13 hours a woman is murdered in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

154
00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:54.973
<v Speaker 1>the number of violent of women in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras has risen 260% it is true that </v>

155
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 1>nowadays the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still has a serious problem.</v>

156
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:03.173
<v Speaker 1>It is still ranked the third west </v>
<v Speaker 1>country when it comes to homicides in </v>

157
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:07.500
<v Speaker 1>relation to its population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And further,</v>

158
00:09:07.501 --> 00:09:08.334
<v Speaker 1>there's the problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 90% of these crimes remain </v>

159
00:09:10.620 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>unpunished,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things while they have improved,</v>

160
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the president's main pride,</v>

161
00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:15.880
<v Speaker 1>them</v>

162
00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.713
<v Speaker 3>joy</v>

163
00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:18.693
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the governments often jurists has </v>

164
00:09:19.991 --> 00:09:22.840
<v Speaker 1>created a new special police force,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is financed,</v>

165
00:09:22.841 --> 00:09:23.674
<v Speaker 1>equipped,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and trained by the dea and FBI among </v>

166
00:09:25.901 --> 00:09:26.734
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time it is expelled and </v>

167
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:28.774
<v Speaker 1>replaced thousands of corrupt agents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has dismantled several drug cartels </v>

168
00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:32.553
<v Speaker 1>and extradited dozens of drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffickers to the United States and </v>

169
00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:39.070
<v Speaker 1>even created parks around the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are guarded by the military police</v>

170
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>so that children and families can enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 1>their leisure time safely.</v>

171
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:47.890
<v Speaker 1>I look Joe Folio platform aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We went by Ethan medicine.</v>

172
00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.150
<v Speaker 1>So far so good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

173
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:56.043
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately their view of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>story does not end there with rainbows </v>

174
00:09:59.411 --> 00:10:00.490
<v Speaker 1>and butterflies</v>

175
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:04.933
<v Speaker 3>is</v>

176
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.520
<v Speaker 1>is player evidence of the presidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>

177
00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:09.413
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 2013 election campaign that brought </v>

178
00:10:11.341 --> 00:10:12.174
<v Speaker 1>him to power was financed by money </v>
<v Speaker 1>stolen from the Honduran Institute of </v>

179
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.093
<v Speaker 1>Social Security and there are even well </v>
<v Speaker 1>founded suspicions that presidents or </v>

180
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>Lando cause connections with drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>trafficking group,</v>

181
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:23.953
<v Speaker 1>illegal drug trade in Honduras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only infected much of its civil </v>

182
00:10:26.751 --> 00:10:27.584
<v Speaker 1>society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the highest levels of </v>

183
00:10:28.941 --> 00:10:29.774
<v Speaker 1>government and its financial sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also brought frightening levels of </v>

184
00:10:32.331 --> 00:10:34.730
<v Speaker 1>violence to its people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>June h Kim,</v>

185
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>the acting United States attorney in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan.</v>

186
00:10:37.430 --> 00:10:38.263
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether these accusations are true or </v>

187
00:10:39.801 --> 00:10:40.790
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

188
00:10:40.850 --> 00:10:42.230
<v Speaker 1>deception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's controlling,</v>

189
00:10:42.231 --> 00:10:45.920
<v Speaker 1>institutions can neither be justified.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Snore contribution to Honduras,</v>

190
00:10:45.921 --> 00:10:49.370
<v Speaker 1>being able to overcome the problems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>impede its development.</v>

191
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.700
<v Speaker 1>The president has clear support from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>international community.</v>

192
00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:53.553
<v Speaker 1>He has received money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>police aid and its military and </v>

193
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>political support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is the people,</v>

194
00:10:58.251 --> 00:11:00.230
<v Speaker 1>they expected something different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bus,</v>

195
00:11:00.290 --> 00:11:01.180
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divya,</v>

196
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.010
<v Speaker 1>all of this isn't that strange in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

197
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.620
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 3>A cocktail</v>

198
00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:11.453
<v Speaker 1>of corruption and violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras is facing a difficult problem </v>

199
00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.463
<v Speaker 1>that is a triangle of interrelated </v>
<v Speaker 1>powers that make being an optimist in </v>

200
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:20.910
<v Speaker 1>Honduras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

201
00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.773
<v Speaker 1>very difficult political power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economic oligarchy and drug </v>

202
00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.600
<v Speaker 1>traffickers grabs the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative case of all this.</v>

203
00:11:30.181 --> 00:11:33.570
<v Speaker 1>Is that a fabby Yo Lobo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's the son of Porphyria Lobo,</v>

204
00:11:33.571 --> 00:11:34.404
<v Speaker 1>the former president of the republic who</v>
<v Speaker 1>was just been sentenced in the United </v>

205
00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:38.393
<v Speaker 1>States to 24 years in prison for his </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement and activities as a drug </v>

206
00:11:42.181 --> 00:11:44.400
<v Speaker 1>trafficker.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He actually did this when his father was</v>

207
00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:47.730
<v Speaker 1>president of the republic and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about a rebellious son</v>

208
00:11:47.731 --> 00:11:49.440
<v Speaker 1>or anything like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's drug trafficking,</v>

209
00:11:49.470 --> 00:11:50.303
<v Speaker 1>by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's currently the country's main </v>

210
00:11:52.110 --> 00:11:56.120
<v Speaker 1>economic activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

211
00:11:56.980 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 1>we'll fed thick on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hold them.</v>

212
00:11:59.381 --> 00:12:00.214
<v Speaker 1>We changed it to [inaudible] Sierras.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another example is the New York Times </v>

213
00:12:03.911 --> 00:12:04.744
<v Speaker 1>reported is parliaments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an underequipped building from the </v>

214
00:12:07.091 --> 00:12:10.240
<v Speaker 1>1950s that lacks the minimum necessary </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>

215
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.103
<v Speaker 1>which contrast with the deputies parking</v>
<v Speaker 1>lost a parking lots that is full of off </v>

216
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:14.734
<v Speaker 1>road vehicles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the latest and most expensive </v>

217
00:12:16.901 --> 00:12:19.630
<v Speaker 1>models,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this affects practically everyone,</v>

218
00:12:19.770 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>but if the governments and as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition,</v>

219
00:12:24.970 --> 00:12:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the police and security forces entre </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved from this,</v>

220
00:12:27.101 --> 00:12:27.934
<v Speaker 1>either extortion and bribery is common </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's widely known that police </v>

221
00:12:30.731 --> 00:12:33.250
<v Speaker 1>members have ties with gangs and drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>traffickers.</v>

222
00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:39.250
<v Speaker 7>Mara Salvatrucha gangsters in Rivera </v>
<v Speaker 7>Hernandez say they receive warnings from</v>

223
00:12:39.251 --> 00:12:40.084
<v Speaker 7>the police of impending sweeps and are </v>
<v Speaker 7>handed captured rivals to execute for </v>

224
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:47.690
<v Speaker 7>anything from $440 to $2,200</v>
<v Speaker 7>ahead.</v>

225
00:12:47.810 --> 00:12:50.710
<v Speaker 7>Sonia Nazario,</v>
<v Speaker 7>Pulitzer Prize winning journalist,</v>

226
00:12:50.800 --> 00:12:52.420
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security forces,</v>

227
00:12:52.480 --> 00:12:53.950
<v Speaker 1>gangs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug traffickers,</v>

228
00:12:54.070 --> 00:12:56.440
<v Speaker 1>and lastly the economic oligarchy.</v>

229
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:59.790
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

230
00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:01.773
<v Speaker 1>10 families controlled practically every</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic resource and have no problems </v>

231
00:13:05.441 --> 00:13:06.274
<v Speaker 1>paying bribes and displacing trustworthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>people in the powerful positions do </v>

232
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.250
<v Speaker 1>generate something that is not a market </v>
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>

233
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:14.380
<v Speaker 1>but a model that is entirely controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the institution.</v>

234
00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:19.170
<v Speaker 1>This nice to have a highly extractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>results network,</v>

235
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.033
<v Speaker 1>and it's ultimately responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras and knots being that paradise </v>

236
00:13:22.570 --> 00:13:24.450
<v Speaker 1>that we discussed at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>

237
00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.550
<v Speaker 1>But we also mentioned the u s </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

238
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:27.384
<v Speaker 1>specifically the trump administration as</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibly being responsible for what </v>

239
00:13:29.941 --> 00:13:33.300
<v Speaker 1>happens with Honduras is elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get into it.</v>

240
00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.660
<v Speaker 7>Washington's important,</v>

241
00:13:43.850 --> 00:13:44.650
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

242
00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:45.483
<v Speaker 1>be forgiven for thinking initially that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras is not that important to </v>

243
00:13:47.891 --> 00:13:48.724
<v Speaker 1>Washington DC rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not exactly the truth is that </v>

244
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:55.180
<v Speaker 1>Honduras has a certain importance to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States for three main reasons.</v>

245
00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.953
<v Speaker 1>Firstly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because a lot of the flights suspected </v>

246
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:04.030
<v Speaker 1>of transporting drugs from South America</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to first stop in this country.</v>

247
00:14:04.031 --> 00:14:05.710
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They think is two years ago,</v>

248
00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:07.390
<v Speaker 1>faced with countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous crisis,</v>

249
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:10.150
<v Speaker 1>18,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year in children traveled alone to the</v>

250
00:14:10.151 --> 00:14:13.180
<v Speaker 1>United States border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nobody in Washington really wants to</v>

251
00:14:13.181 --> 00:14:15.850
<v Speaker 1>see that happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And thirdly,</v>

252
00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:18.640
<v Speaker 1>because Honduras has traditionally been </v>
<v Speaker 1>an allied country,</v>

253
00:14:18.670 --> 00:14:19.503
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States has had a military </v>

254
00:14:20.651 --> 00:14:22.840
<v Speaker 1>base there for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Due to all of this,</v>

255
00:14:22.841 --> 00:14:23.674
<v Speaker 1>the u s has spent billions of dollars in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras in recent years to try and </v>

256
00:14:26.741 --> 00:14:29.560
<v Speaker 1>reverse the country's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the trump administration,</v>

257
00:14:29.561 --> 00:14:32.920
<v Speaker 1>it knows this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why it supports Juan Orlando</v>

258
00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:33.221
<v Speaker 1>Hernandez.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

259
00:14:33.221 --> 00:14:36.070
<v Speaker 1>this is what a prominent Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>advisor said about the matter.</v>

260
00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Washington</v>

261
00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:38.213
<v Speaker 7>has invested significant money in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Central America to help turn the </v>

262
00:14:40.951 --> 00:14:44.760
<v Speaker 7>security and economic situation around.</v>
<v Speaker 7>If Hernandez loses the election,</v>

263
00:14:44.950 --> 00:14:47.430
<v Speaker 7>the United States will have no effective</v>
<v Speaker 7>partners in the region.</v>

264
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:48.323
<v Speaker 7>The effectiveness of our billions would </v>
<v Speaker 7>be at risk and more people might be to </v>

265
00:14:51.591 --> 00:14:52.040
<v Speaker 7>come to</v>

266
00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:52.873
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Danielle ruined day or Republican </v>

267
00:14:54.921 --> 00:14:58.640
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy adviser and former </v>
<v Speaker 1>official of the George W.</v>

268
00:14:58.640 --> 00:14:59.840
<v Speaker 1>Bush administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

269
00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:02.330
<v Speaker 1>Washington support is clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

270
00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:03.223
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were trains and financed by the </v>

271
00:15:04.641 --> 00:15:05.474
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>participated in the post electoral </v>

272
00:15:07.311 --> 00:15:10.190
<v Speaker 1>events without any complaints from the u</v>
<v Speaker 1>s embassy.</v>

273
00:15:13.210 --> 00:15:14.043
<v Speaker 1>And this is because the u s government </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears the tires that Salvador Nasralla </v>

274
00:15:16.731 --> 00:15:17.564
<v Speaker 1>his candidacy you could have with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuban regime and even the regime of </v>

275
00:15:20.001 --> 00:15:21.770
<v Speaker 1>Maduro in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something,</v>

276
00:15:21.771 --> 00:15:23.720
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the candidate deniers,</v>

277
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.860
<v Speaker 1>they're wrong because my model is based </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Uruguay or Chili's,</v>

278
00:15:27.861 --> 00:15:30.320
<v Speaker 1>moderate left or Costa Rica's moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

279
00:15:30.470 --> 00:15:33.290
<v Speaker 1>One thing is the friendship that my </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological partner,</v>

280
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:34.303
<v Speaker 1>Manuel's Aaliyah has with Maduro Miralis</v>
<v Speaker 1>and something very different is what I </v>

281
00:15:38.181 --> 00:15:41.510
<v Speaker 1>think me who would be the President </v>
<v Speaker 1>Salvador Nasralla.</v>

282
00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:42.433
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for everyone watching this video from </v>

283
00:15:43.731 --> 00:15:44.564
<v Speaker 1>Honduras,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should state that things can change </v>

284
00:15:46.850 --> 00:15:48.170
<v Speaker 1>and do tend to change.</v>

285
00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:50.570
<v Speaker 1>There's the case of Columbia as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

286
00:15:50.600 --> 00:15:51.290
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was the alternate.</v>

287
00:15:51.290 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that we could possibly be </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing the first cue to tar backs by the</v>

288
00:15:54.351 --> 00:15:55.430
<v Speaker 1>trump administration?</v>
