1
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Many of you have asked for this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'll be honest,</v>

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.553
<v Speaker 1>we're not very surprised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republic of China better known as </v>

3
00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:14.844
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has some of the most strange and </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial political and diplomatic </v>

4
00:00:17.371 --> 00:00:20.880
<v Speaker 1>situations in the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain.</v>

5
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.803
<v Speaker 1>At the time of publishing this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has only received formal </v>

6
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:28.440
<v Speaker 1>recognition from 20 of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and some of these countries,</v>

7
00:00:28.441 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty small,</v>

8
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:34.581
<v Speaker 1>like the Vatican Tuvalu in Swaziland </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight all of this.</v>

9
00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.383
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has managed to become one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>richest and freest countries on the </v>

10
00:00:40.331 --> 00:00:41.164
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a well equipped army and it is </v>

11
00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:46.420
<v Speaker 1>one of these spear heads over the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States in Southeast Asia.</v>

12
00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:49.533
<v Speaker 1>Before we really get into it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back and see where it </v>

13
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.730
<v Speaker 1>began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great Chinese separation,</v>

14
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.080
<v Speaker 1>the situation Taiwan finds itself in has</v>
<v Speaker 1>its origin in the Chinese civil war,</v>

15
00:01:03.081 --> 00:01:08.081
<v Speaker 1>which took place between 1927 and 1949 </v>
<v Speaker 1>war between the conservative forces.</v>

16
00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:11.354
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese Nationalist Party led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chiang Kai Shek and the forces of the </v>

17
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party of Nazi Tome on December</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 10th,</v>

18
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:19.780
<v Speaker 1>1949.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last setting,</v>

19
00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.490
<v Speaker 1>Chengdu fell into the hands of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalists.</v>

20
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:26.560
<v Speaker 1>The war had ended and the communists and</v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten their way shortly before Chang do</v>

21
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:27.403
<v Speaker 1>fell that they,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in carrying the nationalist leader </v>

22
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.550
<v Speaker 1>Chiang Kai Shek,</v>
<v Speaker 1>left bound for Taiwan.</v>

23
00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.390
<v Speaker 1>The last province under national list </v>
<v Speaker 1>control z didn't go alone.</v>

24
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.053
<v Speaker 1>Check 2 million more people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took shelter in Taiwan along with the </v>

25
00:01:41.311 --> 00:01:45.010
<v Speaker 1>survivors of the nationalist army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then ends,</v>

26
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:46.830
<v Speaker 1>even though mal tried to take the </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands back,</v>

27
00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan has received support from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

28
00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.313
<v Speaker 1>The US continued recognizing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments over the island as the </v>

29
00:01:52.631 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>legitimate government of China up until </v>
<v Speaker 1>1979.</v>

30
00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.483
<v Speaker 1>As a curious note here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan is the only country other than </v>

31
00:01:59.621 --> 00:02:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the US that is continually operated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube spy plane.</v>

32
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>Their mission was to monitor Mao's </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

33
00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.940
<v Speaker 1>The CIA itself was actually in charge of</v>
<v Speaker 1>conducting these operations.</v>

34
00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>About</v>

35
00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:14.560
<v Speaker 1>1979.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a really important date.</v>

36
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.453
<v Speaker 1>At this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States was trying to build </v>

37
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.230
<v Speaker 1>trust with Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was in order to create some sort of</v>

38
00:02:20.231 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 1>a double envelopment against the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

39
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.703
<v Speaker 1>We actually talked about this in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous video and I'll leave a link to </v>

40
00:02:26.231 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 1>that in the description.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>the thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1979,</v>

42
00:02:29.591 --> 00:02:31.830
<v Speaker 1>the presidents of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jimmy Carter,</v>

43
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:32.683
<v Speaker 1>decided to establish diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations with Beijing and mass meant </v>

44
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 1>that they had to stop recognizing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government of the Republic of China.</v>

45
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.413
<v Speaker 1>That is the government based in Taipei.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see Taiwan that never declared its </v>

46
00:02:44.201 --> 00:02:46.630
<v Speaker 1>independence for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government based in Taipei,</v>

47
00:02:46.631 --> 00:02:47.464
<v Speaker 1>captain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering itself as the legitimate </v>

48
00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 1>government of all of China as of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

49
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:56.551
<v Speaker 1>You can only have diplomatically </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking one government and yes,</v>

50
00:02:57.551 --> 00:02:58.384
<v Speaker 1>this is how the one China started and </v>
<v Speaker 1>today this is supported by Washington </v>

51
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.650
<v Speaker 1>Adams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most countries around the world.</v>

52
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.143
<v Speaker 1>This is a change by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the course Taiwan to lose its place in </v>

53
00:03:09.401 --> 00:03:13.000
<v Speaker 1>the UN as well as other important </v>
<v Speaker 1>international organizations,</v>

54
00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.330
<v Speaker 1>but it is true that the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still committed to the security of</v>

55
00:03:19.331 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That same year,</v>

56
00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.543
<v Speaker 1>in 1979,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American Congress passed the Taiwan </v>

57
00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.593
<v Speaker 1>Relations Act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was documents that among other </v>

58
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:27.304
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserve the option for the US to ensure </v>

59
00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:29.704
<v Speaker 1>the security and defense of the islands </v>
<v Speaker 1>and since that act was passed for us </v>

60
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.570
<v Speaker 1>when it's done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just that,</v>

61
00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:47.260
<v Speaker 1>but as I was saying at the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video,</v>

62
00:03:47.261 --> 00:03:48.094
<v Speaker 1>none of these things have kept Taiwan </v>
<v Speaker 1>from being the star of one of the </v>

63
00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:54.150
<v Speaker 1>greatest stories of the economic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>social success,</v>

64
00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 1>big roar of the tiger,</v>

65
00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:01.610
<v Speaker 1>fifties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan.</v>

66
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.473
<v Speaker 1>It was a very poor place that had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty rudimentary economy where their </v>

67
00:04:05.181 --> 00:04:09.050
<v Speaker 1>exports were basically really basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>things like rice and sugar.</v>

68
00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.913
<v Speaker 1>So the question at that time was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how are we going to develop such a port </v>

69
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:14.203
<v Speaker 1>islands while the Taiwanese government </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought the best way to achieve success </v>

70
00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:17.443
<v Speaker 1>was to ensure that businesses on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island could sell their products all </v>

71
00:04:20.421 --> 00:04:21.254
<v Speaker 1>over the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was considered to be the best way </v>

72
00:04:23.331 --> 00:04:26.960
<v Speaker 1>to open up the island to the world and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even encouraged savings.</v>

73
00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.380
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Am I seeing counter intuitive,</v>

74
00:04:30.381 --> 00:04:31.214
<v Speaker 1>but actually this action does encourage </v>
<v Speaker 1>people to save because in order to </v>

75
00:04:34.161 --> 00:04:36.410
<v Speaker 1>invest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you first need to get the resources that</v>

76
00:04:36.411 --> 00:04:39.890
<v Speaker 1>are necessary to do so and well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they did.</v>

77
00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:40.813
<v Speaker 1>The governments of the islands soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to eliminate almost all import </v>

78
00:04:44.091 --> 00:04:44.924
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This meant the businesses could get all </v>

79
00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.533
<v Speaker 1>the products they required to set up </v>
<v Speaker 1>their businesses and assembly lines </v>

80
00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.833
<v Speaker 1>without being stung by import fees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is sort of similar to what it's </v>

81
00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:59.103
<v Speaker 1>this culture of saving attitude,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the legal certainty of the country and </v>

82
00:05:01.921 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>so encouraged further investments world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

83
00:05:04.631 --> 00:05:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Taiwanese companies began appearing like</v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooms after the rain,</v>

84
00:05:07.781 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>as they exploded all kinds of products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest of them,</v>

85
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:13.863
<v Speaker 1>tad industrial products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're already 90 percent of the </v>

86
00:05:16.001 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>country's exports and they were growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>an average of 30 percent per year.</v>

87
00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.833
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

88
00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:23.440
<v Speaker 1>they sold all kinds of things to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

89
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:24.450
<v Speaker 1>toys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>radios,</v>

90
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.440
<v Speaker 1>bike,</v>
<v Speaker 1>socks,</v>

91
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.210
<v Speaker 1>just about everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

92
00:05:27.211 --> 00:05:28.044
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine with that sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that the per capita income </v>

93
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.000
<v Speaker 1>didn't stop growing in just 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It multiplied by F</v>

94
00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.953
<v Speaker 2>fine</v>

95
00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:43.420
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new Asian tiger was born.</v>

96
00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:46.940
<v Speaker 2>Now</v>

97
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>don't a anything that this was an easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>

98
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:49.684
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan didn't even have a democracy </v>

99
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:53.950
<v Speaker 1>until the 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once they've got their freedom,</v>

100
00:05:53.951 --> 00:05:56.920
<v Speaker 1>the Taiwanese people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they held onto it tightly.</v>

101
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.793
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at some example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Today considered the 11 freest </v>

102
00:06:04.551 --> 00:06:05.384
<v Speaker 1>economy in the world in Asia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only Hong Kong and Singapore rank best </v>

103
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:12.410
<v Speaker 1>that it's a rich country with quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high standard of living and it is one of</v>

104
00:06:12.411 --> 00:06:13.244
<v Speaker 1>the countries that has a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>number of civil liberties and in fact </v>

105
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're about to make history.</v>

106
00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:20.703
<v Speaker 3>Taiwan court rules in favor of same sex </v>
<v Speaker 3>marriage in historic first for an Asian </v>

108
00:06:24.701 --> 00:06:25.534
<v Speaker 3>country</v>

109
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>who as you can see compared with </v>
<v Speaker 1>continental China,</v>

110
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:34.803
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is no comparison in terms </v>

111
00:06:36.551 --> 00:06:37.384
<v Speaker 1>of per capita income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Taiwanese onto day three times </v>

112
00:06:39.581 --> 00:06:42.910
<v Speaker 1>richer than the Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are much more free,</v>

113
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:43.823
<v Speaker 1>but in spite of all of this good stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are still some clouds on the </v>

114
00:06:47.411 --> 00:06:48.310
<v Speaker 1>horizon,</v>

115
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 3>clouds in the Taiwanese sky.</v>

116
00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.210
<v Speaker 1>The truth is this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last few years,</v>

117
00:06:57.211 --> 00:06:59.520
<v Speaker 1>the country has been going through a few</v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

118
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Salaries have been frozen for years and </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't see thousand and 15.</v>

119
00:07:02.791 --> 00:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>The country went through a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>recessions since then.</v>

120
00:07:05.461 --> 00:07:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Economic growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.570
<v Speaker 1>it's been very slow and now be rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>obvious.</v>

122
00:07:09.571 --> 00:07:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Question is what exactly is happening?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

123
00:07:12.661 --> 00:07:15.630
<v Speaker 1>there are several ingredients to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather bitter recipe,</v>

124
00:07:15.631 --> 00:07:17.250
<v Speaker 1>which is threatening the future.</v>

125
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:18.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

126
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.210
<v Speaker 1>This is competition from new emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets like China,</v>

127
00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:25.500
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

128
00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:26.663
<v Speaker 1>also the brain drain and the aging </v>
<v Speaker 1>population and the cliffs to broken </v>

129
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:30.233
<v Speaker 1>pension system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The latter of the pension system is the </v>

130
00:07:32.371 --> 00:07:36.000
<v Speaker 1>problem vertebra by far concerns the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government of the most.</v>

131
00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.220
<v Speaker 1>Look for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pensions of public workers.</v>

132
00:07:38.221 --> 00:07:40.080
<v Speaker 1>They were inflated for political </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>

133
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.840
<v Speaker 1>They did this in order to get votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adams well,</v>

134
00:07:42.841 --> 00:07:45.690
<v Speaker 1>it became really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really expensive.</v>

135
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:46.583
<v Speaker 1>Public pensions whipped so inflated that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are now threatening the stability </v>

136
00:07:49.951 --> 00:07:52.800
<v Speaker 1>of the entire system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwanese</v>

137
00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 3>workers earn about 1300 US dollars per </v>
<v Speaker 3>month on average,</v>

138
00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:57.333
<v Speaker 3>but retired high school teachers receive</v>
<v Speaker 3>a whopping average pension of 2,250 US </v>

139
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:02.854
<v Speaker 3>dollars per month.</v>

140
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.370
<v Speaker 1>As you well know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad policies turnouts to be expensive.</v>

141
00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 1>Let's consider some of the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems to continue our.</v>

142
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>For the next ingredients in our bitter </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipe would be what is called the 40 40</v>

143
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 1>issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like the Taiwanese economy.</v>

144
00:08:18.811 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>It's very dependent on the electronic </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry as well as commerce in China,</v>

145
00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:24.643
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

146
00:08:27.320 --> 00:08:29.180
<v Speaker 3>goods or 40 percent of all of their </v>
<v Speaker 3>export,</v>

147
00:08:31.190 --> 00:08:35.510
<v Speaker 3>and China is the destination of almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>40 percent of Taiwan's export,</v>

148
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:41.090
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:08:41.091 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is the problem with that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:08:42.861 --> 00:08:46.670
<v Speaker 1>this dependence on electronics and China</v>
<v Speaker 1>means that when the electronics industry</v>

151
00:08:46.671 --> 00:08:49.100
<v Speaker 1>or China isn't doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economically,</v>

152
00:08:49.250 --> 00:08:50.083
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan suffers too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's precisely what has happened </v>

153
00:08:53.181 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>over the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait,</v>

154
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.300
<v Speaker 1>because we're not done yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>

155
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:58.134
<v Speaker 1>that is a political problem which has </v>
<v Speaker 1>affected the country severely and has </v>

156
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:01.944
<v Speaker 1>caused for an investment in Taiwan to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>significantly lower than that of the </v>

157
00:09:05.341 --> 00:09:08.430
<v Speaker 1>countries nearby and so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem that?</v>

158
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign investors are afraid of China.</v>

159
00:09:14.830 --> 00:09:15.663
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is by far the biggest problem that </v>

160
00:09:20.491 --> 00:09:21.324
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan is facing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Humans of Beijing is determining to </v>

161
00:09:24.481 --> 00:09:25.314
<v Speaker 1>regain sovereignty over the islands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's made a public declaration on the </v>

162
00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:30.810
<v Speaker 1>data that states two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

163
00:09:30.811 --> 00:09:32.460
<v Speaker 1>it will happen before 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>

164
00:09:32.490 --> 00:09:35.160
<v Speaker 1>the 100th anniversary of the People's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic of China,</v>

165
00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:39.600
<v Speaker 1>and secondly that they are willing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use force if Taiwan tries to declare its</v>

166
00:09:39.601 --> 00:09:41.760
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me dig into that.</v>

167
00:09:41.761 --> 00:09:42.594
<v Speaker 1>A little Taiwan could be considered an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent country from pretty much </v>

168
00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:49.223
<v Speaker 1>every perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The island has its own presidents whose </v>

169
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.090
<v Speaker 1>democratically elected by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has its own laws.</v>

170
00:09:54.091 --> 00:09:55.950
<v Speaker 1>It has its own army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

171
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:56.833
<v Speaker 1>Beijing isn't going to accept formal </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence the most they are willing </v>

172
00:10:00.661 --> 00:10:01.494
<v Speaker 1>to give.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan temporarily is a status similar </v>

173
00:10:03.481 --> 00:10:07.620
<v Speaker 1>to that of Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is pretty serious because among</v>

174
00:10:07.650 --> 00:10:08.483
<v Speaker 1>other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most Taiwanese don't feel that their </v>

175
00:10:10.171 --> 00:10:11.340
<v Speaker 1>identity is paint.</v>

176
00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:12.633
<v Speaker 2>No</v>

177
00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:19.830
<v Speaker 1>citizens of a free country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has been independent for almost 70</v>

178
00:10:19.831 --> 00:10:20.940
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

179
00:10:20.970 --> 00:10:21.803
<v Speaker 1>in 2014 when the previous government </v>
<v Speaker 1>solve Taiwan tried to approach Beijing </v>

180
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:26.004
<v Speaker 1>to develop a trade agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Taiwanese people started a </v>

181
00:10:28.171 --> 00:10:32.160
<v Speaker 1>revolution which eventually became known</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the sunflower revolution.</v>

182
00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:34.650
<v Speaker 1>Hundreds of young people protested with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the motto.</v>

183
00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan is not.</v>

184
00:10:36.370 --> 00:10:37.203
<v Speaker 2>Sale</v>

185
00:10:41.830 --> 00:10:42.663
<v Speaker 1>was exactly under this atmosphere of </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and political frustration that </v>

186
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.750
<v Speaker 1>in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Democratic Progressive Policy,</v>

187
00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.750
<v Speaker 1>a party whose foundations were mainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>pro independence,</v>

188
00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:57.780
<v Speaker 1>one that the legislative and </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential election citing wing,</v>

189
00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.173
<v Speaker 1>not the closest politician to Beijing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that became the first female presidents </v>

190
00:11:01.901 --> 00:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>of Tyler</v>

191
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:03.193
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>

192
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.070
<v Speaker 1>even though the economy was the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>crucial factor,</v>

193
00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.470
<v Speaker 1>Beijing didn't like this election at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

194
00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:10.333
<v Speaker 1>They disapproved of it so much that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to start harassing Taiwan again </v>

195
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:15.583
<v Speaker 1>in 2017 and up to now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese tourism to Taiwan has been </v>

196
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:21.710
<v Speaker 1>reduced by 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing has convinced to countries,</v>

197
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:22.573
<v Speaker 1>Panama and Sao Tome and Principe to stop</v>
<v Speaker 1>recognizing Taiwan and it is blocking </v>

198
00:11:26.121 --> 00:11:29.000
<v Speaker 1>the presence of the island in many </v>
<v Speaker 1>international forums.</v>

199
00:11:29.830 --> 00:11:32.300
<v Speaker 1>For now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been no economic retaliation,</v>

200
00:11:32.301 --> 00:11:35.900
<v Speaker 1>but the island knew that they could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in for a Sivia below.</v>

201
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.793
<v Speaker 1>This is why one of the priorities of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>new government is to open up to as many </v>

202
00:11:39.531 --> 00:11:42.170
<v Speaker 1>new markets as possible as soon as </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>

203
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:44.990
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering where is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US and all of this.</v>

204
00:11:44.991 --> 00:11:46.640
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a visual politic video.</v>

205
00:11:46.641 --> 00:11:47.474
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we've been a little light on the US </v>

206
00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.630
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so where are they?</v>

207
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.291
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for now,</v>

208
00:11:51.291 --> 00:11:54.060
<v Speaker 1>their support seems to remain in tact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

209
00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.840
<v Speaker 1>trump's administration is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>approved.</v>

210
00:11:55.841 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>A weapon sale to Taiwan went off at one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point $5,000,000,000.</v>

211
00:12:00.370 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>Trump administration approves first arms</v>
<v Speaker 1>sale to Taiwan,</v>

212
00:12:04.210 --> 00:12:05.043
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the powerful Senate Arms Services </v>

213
00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Committee in the United States and navy </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships to use Taiwanese ports,</v>

214
00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:11.483
<v Speaker 1>and they did so with a majority of votes</v>
<v Speaker 1>from both the democratic and the </v>

215
00:12:14.411 --> 00:12:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Republican parties in both chambers </v>
<v Speaker 1>finally approved that decision.</v>

216
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.250
<v Speaker 1>You can bet to the Beijing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be pretty annoyed.</v>

217
00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:23.430
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is Washington's objective yet?</v>

218
00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be to try and prevent Beijing</v>

219
00:12:25.781 --> 00:12:26.614
<v Speaker 1>from even thinking about a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion of Taiwan and that's pretty </v>

220
00:12:30.341 --> 00:12:31.450
<v Speaker 1>much it for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here are visual.</v>

221
00:12:31.451 --> 00:12:32.284
<v Speaker 1>Politic wiggins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Keep a close eye on Taiwan as the </v>

222
00:12:34.001 --> 00:12:36.280
<v Speaker 1>situation develops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>
