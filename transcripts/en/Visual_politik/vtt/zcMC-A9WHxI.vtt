2
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 2>It is the fifth most valuable company in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the wells.</v>

3
00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.430
<v Speaker 2>Each minutes of the company brings in </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than $250,000</v>

4
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.293
<v Speaker 2>it's income in 2016 was more than $136 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion and you know what's the best </v>

5
00:00:21.341 --> 00:00:24.090
<v Speaker 2>part is the company is only 23 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>old.</v>

6
00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:29.520
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.790
<v Speaker 2>this is to say according to our </v>
<v Speaker 2>demographics there at visual politic,</v>

8
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:36.660
<v Speaker 2>Amazon is probably younger than you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was a time in history when the most</v>

9
00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.240
<v Speaker 2>powerful nations look to build huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>empires.</v>

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.290
<v Speaker 2>The British,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish,</v>

11
00:00:40.291 --> 00:00:41.310
<v Speaker 2>the Romans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Mongols.</v>

12
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:45.950
<v Speaker 2>Today things are rather different though</v>
<v Speaker 2>it seems that the great nations of years</v>

13
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.830
<v Speaker 2>past to being substituted by new massive</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology corporations.</v>

14
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.170
<v Speaker 2>As an example of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have the Amazon App.</v>

15
00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.950
<v Speaker 2>When this it is not just a figure of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech.</v>

16
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.440
<v Speaker 2>Let's imagine that you wanted to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon,</v>

17
00:01:03.441 --> 00:01:06.320
<v Speaker 2>which is now the unquestionable leader </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the commerce.</v>

18
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.200
<v Speaker 2>Have you got any idea how much you would</v>
<v Speaker 2>have to pay for this company?</v>

19
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.850
<v Speaker 2>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just try and guess at it.</v>

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:17.523
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the actual figure is $420 billion as of </v>

21
00:01:20.261 --> 00:01:23.950
<v Speaker 2>the recording of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's nearly half a trillion dollars,</v>

22
00:01:23.951 --> 00:01:28.690
<v Speaker 2>which is a truly incredible figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is because Amazon stock has tripled</v>

23
00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.553
<v Speaker 2>since 2015 which has made Amazon the </v>
<v Speaker 2>unquestionable star of the market as </v>

24
00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:41.800
<v Speaker 2>this is not just a matter of numbers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also a matter of reality.</v>

25
00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:43.690
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who hasn't heard of Amazon?</v>

26
00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm as an is Dhea view the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>ecommerce company in the wells,</v>

27
00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.050
<v Speaker 2>but oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so much more.</v>

28
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Did you know that it's also the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader in Web services?</v>

29
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.320
<v Speaker 2>I'm the still more than that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>24 hour delivery,</v>

<v Speaker 2>and even trucks,</v>

32
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.330
<v Speaker 2>planes and ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right now,</v>

33
00:02:05.331 --> 00:02:06.164
<v Speaker 2>while you're watching this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon is working out how to reduce </v>

34
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:10.790
<v Speaker 2>their dependence on big logistics </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>

35
00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.693
<v Speaker 2>notably with the company deciding to </v>
<v Speaker 2>move into the shipping industry and a </v>

36
00:02:14.001 --> 00:02:14.834
<v Speaker 2>great deal of the company's success can </v>
<v Speaker 2>be put down to its delivery time with </v>

37
00:02:17.661 --> 00:02:18.494
<v Speaker 2>some deliveries today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even happening on the same day as the </v>

38
00:02:21.171 --> 00:02:22.004
<v Speaker 2>order.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't we set everything as it does </v>

39
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:29.150
<v Speaker 2>is in the online world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is starting to</v>

40
00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.083
<v Speaker 3>change the leaders of the company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially the president and main </v>

41
00:02:33.871 --> 00:02:34.704
<v Speaker 3>shareholder.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jeff Bezos want to occupy the entire </v>

42
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.584
<v Speaker 3>market and they've realized that sill </v>
<v Speaker 3>more than 90% of all purchases are made </v>

43
00:02:41.701 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 3>in traditional brick and mortar shops.</v>

44
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.853
<v Speaker 2>What does it happen to?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This potential of the company leaders </v>

45
00:02:47.301 --> 00:02:49.760
<v Speaker 2>have set the goal of revolutionizing </v>
<v Speaker 2>commerce,</v>

46
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.460
<v Speaker 2>not just ecommerce,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but physical commerce.</v>

47
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this has already started.</v>

48
00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:55.803
<v Speaker 3>Amazon already has several bookstores </v>
<v Speaker 3>available in the United States and even </v>

49
00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:02.050
<v Speaker 3>about to open Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 3>go to the public,</v>

50
00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:04.750
<v Speaker 3>the first supermarket without cashiers</v>

51
00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:10.343
<v Speaker 2>prized whether you should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because what Amazon is looking to do is </v>

52
00:03:12.421 --> 00:03:16.260
<v Speaker 2>dominate this market as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as well as Amazon is apt to do,</v>

53
00:03:16.261 --> 00:03:18.960
<v Speaker 2>they will keep on trying until they </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeed.</v>

54
00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.120
<v Speaker 2>Up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most offline companies,</v>

55
00:03:21.121 --> 00:03:22.050
<v Speaker 2>both big,</v>
<v Speaker 2>medium,</v>

56
00:03:22.051 --> 00:03:24.810
<v Speaker 2>and small have suffered because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>online competition.</v>

57
00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.110
<v Speaker 2>So imagine what could happen if Amazon </v>
<v Speaker 2>brings its competition to the physical.</v>

58
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:29.200
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

59
00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:30.033
<v Speaker 1>Marquez</v>

60
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:34.100
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think of the consequences that can arise</v>

61
00:03:34.101 --> 00:03:36.080
<v Speaker 2>from the automation of jobs in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>area,</v>

62
00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:37.160
<v Speaker 2>which is Bali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The way,</v>

63
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the areas which employs the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

64
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.300
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's still too soon to have the media</v>

65
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:42.134
<v Speaker 2>concerns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you own a store or your work in </v>

66
00:03:43.971 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 2>one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe it's time to consider what's going</v>

67
00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:47.510
<v Speaker 2>to happen over the coming years.</v>

68
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:48.403
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

69
00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.620
<v Speaker 3>Amazon effect</v>

70
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:54.683
<v Speaker 2>recurring messages during Donald Trump's</v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential campaign was the </v>

71
00:03:57.031 --> 00:03:57.864
<v Speaker 2>competition with countries like China or</v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico was making American industry </v>

72
00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:02.094
<v Speaker 2>disappear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is why in order to protect and </v>

73
00:04:03.661 --> 00:04:07.440
<v Speaker 2>recover all of those jobs from seeks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>put barriers against foreign trade,</v>

74
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.780
<v Speaker 2>specifically targeting imports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The problem in here,</v>

75
00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:10.643
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we have already seen in previous </v>

76
00:04:11.731 --> 00:04:15.030
<v Speaker 2>visual politic videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that this doesn't really work.</v>

77
00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.130
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is true that 7 million jobs have been</v>

78
00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 2>lost in American industry in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>

79
00:04:19.411 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't because factories have </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappeared.</v>

80
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

81
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:27.330
<v Speaker 2>industrial production in the U S is </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost higher than it's ever been.</v>

82
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:29.713
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>

83
00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.730
<v Speaker 2>there's so many jobs have been lost is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not because of the closing of factories,</v>

84
00:04:35.731 --> 00:04:38.520
<v Speaker 2>but because of the new industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>reality.</v>

85
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.450
<v Speaker 2>Factories need less workers due to </v>
<v Speaker 2>automated systems like robots.</v>

86
00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:43.141
<v Speaker 2>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

87
00:04:43.141 --> 00:04:46.110
<v Speaker 2>so now you might be wondering why you're</v>
<v Speaker 2>telling us all of this.</v>

88
00:04:46.111 --> 00:04:49.620
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this a video without Amazon and </v>
<v Speaker 2>here we are hearing about Donald Trump?</v>

89
00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:50.850
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes it is.</v>

90
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.743
<v Speaker 2>And here's why.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's relevance between the impact of </v>

91
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.233
<v Speaker 2>ECOMMERCE,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is growing more and more popular </v>

92
00:04:56.041 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 2>plus this scenario of Amazon developing </v>
<v Speaker 2>their automated supermarkets.</v>

93
00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:00.413
<v Speaker 2>It's easy to imagine how many companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>will go bankrupt and the quantity of </v>

94
00:05:03.361 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 2>jobs that will be lost in this sector </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone.</v>

95
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.430
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't necessarily a bad thing.</v>

96
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it will be if we don't find a way</v>

97
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:11.184
<v Speaker 2>to adapt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if we do our own marked benefits as </v>

98
00:05:13.951 --> 00:05:16.140
<v Speaker 2>an example today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are more than 100,000</v>

99
00:05:16.141 --> 00:05:20.070
<v Speaker 2>companies working with Amazon who earn </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than $100,000</v>

100
00:05:20.071 --> 00:05:21.590
<v Speaker 2>per year look bad</v>

101
00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:22.603
<v Speaker 1>price,</v>

102
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:26.880
<v Speaker 2>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of people in businesses are</v>

103
00:05:26.881 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 2>behind the times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are simply not ready and prepared for</v>

104
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:32.760
<v Speaker 2>the changes that are coming as without </v>
<v Speaker 2>being ready and prepared.</v>

105
00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:35.580
<v Speaker 2>It will be almost impossible to adapt in</v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

106
00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:36.563
<v Speaker 2>But all of that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take our focus back to Amazon and </v>

107
00:05:38.821 --> 00:05:42.430
<v Speaker 2>to a much more interesting subject,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that subject is money.</v>

108
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

109
00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:48.293
<v Speaker 3>gold mine</v>

110
00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:50.230
<v Speaker 1>know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I knew</v>

111
00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:51.063
<v Speaker 2>what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Amazon is so successful and it's </v>

112
00:05:52.901 --> 00:05:56.710
<v Speaker 2>worth more than $400 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's got to be a gold mine.</v>

113
00:05:56.740 --> 00:05:59.720
<v Speaker 2>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and incredible money making machine.</v>

114
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.350
<v Speaker 2>Well not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least for the time being.</v>

115
00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:04.273
<v Speaker 2>It is true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're results are improving every </v>

116
00:06:05.721 --> 00:06:08.500
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then 2016 when it was no exceptions,</v>

117
00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:10.603
<v Speaker 2>Amazon has submitted record results.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The company has a surplus of two </v>

118
00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:17.960
<v Speaker 2>thousand three hundred and seventy one </v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollars.</v>

119
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.670
<v Speaker 2>That is a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

120
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.683
<v Speaker 2>But the problem is that if we were to </v>
<v Speaker 2>buy Amazon for that $400 billion in the </v>

121
00:06:23.901 --> 00:06:24.734
<v Speaker 2>company kept returning that amount of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money every year or why they would take </v>

122
00:06:26.781 --> 00:06:30.050
<v Speaker 2>us almost 180 years to recoup our </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

123
00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:30.913
<v Speaker 2>So considering this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't actually sound like that </v>

124
00:06:33.251 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 2>great of an investment.</v>

125
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just to know if a company makes money on</v>

126
00:06:41.051 --> 00:06:42.340
<v Speaker 2>us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>like real money,</v>

127
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:43.203
<v Speaker 2>I like to try something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a test and that test is to look at </v>

128
00:06:46.001 --> 00:06:46.834
<v Speaker 2>the amount of money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really coming and going in the </v>

129
00:06:49.121 --> 00:06:49.841
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

130
00:06:49.841 --> 00:06:50.674
<v Speaker 2>in the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon has brought in a surplus of more </v>

131
00:06:53.201 --> 00:06:56.950
<v Speaker 2>than 15 point $5 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The numbers get better,</v>

132
00:06:56.951 --> 00:07:00.700
<v Speaker 2>but it's still relatively low compared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the purchase price of the company.</v>

133
00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:03.820
<v Speaker 2>So now you might be wondering what </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly is going on here?</v>

134
00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 2>Why is Amazon worth quite so much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

135
00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:07.570
<v Speaker 2>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bezos,</v>

136
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.910
<v Speaker 2>the presidents of Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has a strategy,</v>

137
00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.380
<v Speaker 2>invest all he can to reach new markets </v>
<v Speaker 2>and improve the company's service.</v>

138
00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:15.243
<v Speaker 2>Consider this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2016 Amazon launched prime video to </v>

139
00:07:18.431 --> 00:07:20.560
<v Speaker 2>compete with Netflix and HBO.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:07:20.561 --> 00:07:25.540
<v Speaker 2>this year Amazon is going to spend $4 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion on films and TV series.</v>

141
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 2>And other example is the so called </v>
<v Speaker 2>project everest.</v>

142
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:29.103
<v Speaker 2>In the next years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon is going to invest billions of </v>

143
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 2>dollars in order to come to the market </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader in.</v>

144
00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:34.403
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

145
00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.540
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is said that the company is trying to</v>

146
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:42.860
<v Speaker 2>open hundreds of shops in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So these are the reasons why the company</v>

147
00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:43.694
<v Speaker 2>is worth so much.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Investors expect their business to take </v>

148
00:07:47.661 --> 00:07:50.510
<v Speaker 2>off in the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Following this,</v>

149
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.493
<v Speaker 2>Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse to </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerful investment banks expect Amazon </v>

150
00:07:55.881 --> 00:08:00.530
<v Speaker 2>to be the main character of the largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>expansion in the history of business.</v>

151
00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:04.730
<v Speaker 2>How much are we really talking about </v>
<v Speaker 2>here?</v>

152
00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>estimates are that in a few years,</v>

153
00:08:06.801 --> 00:08:07.634
<v Speaker 2>the income of Amazon will exceed $500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion more than four times that of </v>

154
00:08:11.301 --> 00:08:14.060
<v Speaker 2>2016 as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Banks understand that,</v>

155
00:08:14.061 --> 00:08:17.960
<v Speaker 2>and that means money is going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue flowing through Amazon's vein,</v>

156
00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:22.910
<v Speaker 2>new empire.</v>

157
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:24.140
<v Speaker 1>It's</v>

158
00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.760
<v Speaker 2>like does that mean that Amazon is going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to conquer the world?</v>

159
00:08:26.761 --> 00:08:27.594
<v Speaker 2>So to say?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we have to admit that Amazon's </v>

160
00:08:28.611 --> 00:08:29.444
<v Speaker 2>success has been pretty overwhelming and</v>
<v Speaker 2>their company couldn't really be doing </v>

161
00:08:32.161 --> 00:08:33.240
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

162
00:08:33.241 --> 00:08:36.690
<v Speaker 2>it's also important to remember that </v>
<v Speaker 2>competition is everywhere.</v>

163
00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:37.860
<v Speaker 2>IBM,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Microsoft,</v>

164
00:08:37.861 --> 00:08:38.581
<v Speaker 2>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Walmart,</v>

165
00:08:38.581 --> 00:08:39.414
<v Speaker 2>Alibaba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These vast companies are not going to </v>

166
00:08:41.671 --> 00:08:45.600
<v Speaker 2>merely be spectators here and let's </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider the final company.</v>

167
00:08:45.601 --> 00:08:50.601
<v Speaker 2>We mentioned that Ali Baba for Queen of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese e commerce in China.</v>

168
00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.833
<v Speaker 2>Amazon has experienced a massive </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappointment despite investing great </v>

169
00:08:55.651 --> 00:08:56.484
<v Speaker 2>deal of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amazon's market share is less than 1% </v>

170
00:08:59.160 --> 00:08:59.993
<v Speaker 2>and wait for more because the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are going to be the talk of </v>

171
00:09:03.271 --> 00:09:04.104
<v Speaker 2>the town for all these reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Div some something that Amazon will </v>

172
00:09:07.081 --> 00:09:07.914
<v Speaker 2>become the Super Company if the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 2>century and builds up to an embalmer </v>

173
00:09:11.840 --> 00:09:12.673
<v Speaker 2>that's on the country or this thing that</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a fantastic company but it's worth </v>

174
00:09:15.541 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 2>and expectations are a bit of a bubble </v>
<v Speaker 2>based exaggeration for now though we can</v>

175
00:09:20.131 --> 00:09:22.380
<v Speaker 2>say for sure that there is one clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>winner.</v>

176
00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.370
<v Speaker 2>Jeff Bezos is now the world's second </v>
<v Speaker 2>richest person.</v>

177
00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Bezos has a net worth of 75 point $6 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion.</v>

178
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:32.303
<v Speaker 2>But one thing is for sure there is still</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge battle to be fought in this </v>

179
00:09:35.461 --> 00:09:37.860
<v Speaker 2>relatively new land known as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Internet.</v>

180
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:39.960
<v Speaker 2>So that's our opinion here at visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic.</v>

181
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:41.790
<v Speaker 2>And now we would love to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

182
00:09:41.791 --> 00:09:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Amazon will achieve its </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal of taking over?</v>

183
00:09:44.461 --> 00:09:45.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pretty much everything.</v>

184
00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:49.530
<v Speaker 2>Well it start making massive amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money or will the competition stop it?</v>
