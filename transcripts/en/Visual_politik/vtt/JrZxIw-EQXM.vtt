1
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.060
<v Speaker 1>We know immigration is a hot topic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

2
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:16.110
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's a polarizing subject.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be in favor of it,</v>

3
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:18.930
<v Speaker 1>we might be against it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you're unlikely to be neutral.</v>

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:19.793
<v Speaker 1>You're probably also think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration is either an opportunity or </v>

5
00:00:22.261 --> 00:00:23.094
<v Speaker 1>it's a threat,</v>

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.123
<v Speaker 2>and Jane Migration Ending Chain </v>
<v Speaker 2>Migration and canceling the visa </v>

7
00:00:29.621 --> 00:00:30.454
<v Speaker 2>lottery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President trump has railed against the </v>

8
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 2>immigration family reunification program</v>
<v Speaker 2>since 2016,</v>

9
00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 2>making it a centerpiece of his campaign </v>
<v Speaker 2>for president,</v>

10
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:39.543
<v Speaker 2>but now that the first lady's parents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his in laws have used the program to </v>

11
00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.363
<v Speaker 2>have to become US citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Critics are the ones having the field </v>

12
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:49.390
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Shane migration is one of the disasters.</v>

13
00:00:49.391 --> 00:00:52.700
<v Speaker 2>Chain migration is a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disaster.</v>

14
00:00:52.701 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 2>A total disaster chain migration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however,</v>

15
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>was in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's another kind of immigration that</v>

16
00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.140
<v Speaker 1>isn't talked about very much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but which involves a huge flow of people</v>

17
00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.900
<v Speaker 1>moving from one territory to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single.</v>

18
00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:07.734
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about interstate </v>

19
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.983
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the kind of immigration that happens </v>

20
00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:14.250
<v Speaker 1>between the states that make up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire country.</v>

21
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.940
<v Speaker 1>This is something that creates winners </v>
<v Speaker 1>and losers.</v>

22
00:01:16.941 --> 00:01:17.210
<v Speaker 1>Steak,</v>

23
00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.690
<v Speaker 2>sweet have losers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have losers.</v>

24
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:20.603
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks after Donald Trump and the </v>

25
00:01:21.331 --> 00:01:22.164
<v Speaker 1>republican party's latest fiscal reform </v>
<v Speaker 1>and everything indicates that this type </v>

26
00:01:24.901 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 1>of immigration is going to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously,</v>

27
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.043
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people tend to immigrate to the most </v>

28
00:01:29.851 --> 00:01:30.684
<v Speaker 1>prosperous territories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here are a few questions that you </v>

29
00:01:33.211 --> 00:01:34.044
<v Speaker 1>might now be asking yourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What interstate immigration trends are </v>

30
00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.463
<v Speaker 1>happening in the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does this type of integration </v>

31
00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:40.313
<v Speaker 1>entail?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which states are the winners and which </v>

32
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:43.950
<v Speaker 1>are the losers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why and well,</v>

33
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:45.640
<v Speaker 1>what can we expect in the future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:45.641 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>let someone look at all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shall We?</v>

35
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.650
<v Speaker 1>Winners and losers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

36
00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.830
<v Speaker 1>Millions of Americans pack up their bags</v>
<v Speaker 1>and move to another state.</v>

37
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>Some states have positive immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>balances every year.</v>

38
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>That is to say year after year more </v>
<v Speaker 1>compatriots arrive,</v>

39
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 1>then leave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also of course the opposite happens.</v>

40
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.110
<v Speaker 1>Some states see many residents move to </v>
<v Speaker 1>another state every year,</v>

41
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:20.310
<v Speaker 1>many more than the number who arrive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is because states compete with each</v>

42
00:02:20.311 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

43
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:25.830
<v Speaker 1>each state has its own characteristics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's own regulations,</v>

44
00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:27.270
<v Speaker 1>its own taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>

45
00:02:27.271 --> 00:02:28.104
<v Speaker 1>and logically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes some states much more </v>

46
00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:30.384
<v Speaker 1>prosperous than others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously people tend to move to more </v>

47
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>prosperous places to states where </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more work,</v>

48
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.383
<v Speaker 1>there's better living conditions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>where more companies are being </v>

49
00:02:38.611 --> 00:02:39.444
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well according to data from the irs or </v>

50
00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:42.384
<v Speaker 1>internal revenue service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the federal government agency </v>

51
00:02:44.221 --> 00:02:49.221
<v Speaker 1>responsible for collecting taxes between</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of 2015 and the start of 2016 to</v>

52
00:02:49.361 --> 00:02:52.230
<v Speaker 1>two point eight percent of taxpayers and</v>
<v Speaker 1>moved to another state.</v>

53
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.153
<v Speaker 1>According to this information now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I assure you that the irs has the </v>

54
00:02:55.351 --> 00:02:58.110
<v Speaker 1>best data in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the migration rates,</v>

55
00:02:58.111 --> 00:02:58.944
<v Speaker 1>the internal mobility in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States is very and I mean very high </v>

56
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.590
<v Speaker 1>compared to other developed countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said this,</v>

57
00:03:10.221 --> 00:03:13.280
<v Speaker 1>do you want to know which states that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest migration read deficit that</v>

58
00:03:13.281 --> 00:03:16.910
<v Speaker 1>is the states with the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between Americans leaving and</v>

59
00:03:16.911 --> 00:03:17.870
<v Speaker 1>arriving pay?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

60
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

61
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.640
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

62
00:03:27.641 --> 00:03:28.474
<v Speaker 1>New York is in the lead as the least </v>
<v Speaker 1>attractive state for Americans to stay </v>

63
00:03:32.021 --> 00:03:32.854
<v Speaker 1>in in net terms only in 2016 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>discounting arrivals more than 150,000 </v>

64
00:03:37.391 --> 00:03:37.880
<v Speaker 1>Americans</v>

65
00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:38.713
<v Speaker 3>left.</v>

66
00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.410
<v Speaker 1>It's followed by other states such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois,</v>

67
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.330
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and California,</v>

68
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:47.700
<v Speaker 1>and really could anyone imagine the </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

69
00:03:47.701 --> 00:03:48.534
<v Speaker 1>the land of technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gorgeous beaches in good weather would </v>

70
00:03:50.701 --> 00:03:51.870
<v Speaker 1>be on this list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

71
00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.240
<v Speaker 1>there it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the opposite question.</v>

72
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.290
<v Speaker 1>What are the states with the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>migratory surplus of Americans?</v>

73
00:03:58.291 --> 00:03:59.124
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

74
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Florida with a positive balance of about</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,000 Americans has become the big</v>

75
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.043
<v Speaker 3>winner.</v>

76
00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.010
<v Speaker 1>Mind you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this information is from 2016,</v>

77
00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.620
<v Speaker 1>but if instead of taking the data from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last available,</v>

78
00:04:20.621 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we looked at a longer period of time.</v>

79
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:24.840
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the beginning of the 19 nineties,</v>

80
00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.100
<v Speaker 1>the result is practically the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New York,</v>

81
00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:28.790
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Illinois last,</v>

82
00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.000
<v Speaker 1>the most Americans while Florida,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona,</v>

83
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.590
<v Speaker 1>and Texas one the most.</v>

84
00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:36.273
<v Speaker 1>And hold on a second here because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really much more important than you </v>

85
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:40.564
<v Speaker 1>might be thinking during the video we </v>
<v Speaker 1>made recently about the hidden debts of </v>

86
00:04:43.181 --> 00:04:45.040
<v Speaker 1>the different states in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well folks,</v>

87
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:48.880
<v Speaker 1>every time estate loses Americans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it loses a bit of wealth.</v>

88
00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.190
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the almost 200,000 Americans,</v>

89
00:04:51.191 --> 00:04:52.024
<v Speaker 1>he moved to Florida in net terms in 2016</v>
<v Speaker 1>as an income of more than </v>

90
00:04:55.001 --> 00:04:55.834
<v Speaker 1>$17,000,000,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an income that from now on will </v>

91
00:04:59.411 --> 00:05:00.244
<v Speaker 1>be produced within Florida positive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will be saved in the state's </v>

92
00:05:02.981 --> 00:05:03.814
<v Speaker 1>financial entities while another part </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be spent in its stores and </v>

93
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:07.270
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cinemas,</v>

94
00:05:07.271 --> 00:05:08.104
<v Speaker 1>restaurants and gas stations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and another part that will be invested </v>

95
00:05:10.721 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>in new businesses that will be mainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>located within Florida.</v>

96
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 1>All of this means more wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more work,</v>

97
00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:21.473
<v Speaker 1>and what tax revenues for the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at this point you might be beginning </v>

98
00:05:23.851 --> 00:05:26.700
<v Speaker 1>to see why this is quite so important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

99
00:05:26.701 --> 00:05:28.870
<v Speaker 1>having seen all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question does remain well,</v>

100
00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 1>what variables?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They explained this movement of people.</v>

101
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.783
<v Speaker 1>Well listen up competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many reasons why people move </v>

102
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:47.540
<v Speaker 1>from one place to another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This family work,</v>

103
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.410
<v Speaker 1>climate opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

104
00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 1>plenty of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

105
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:52.990
<v Speaker 1>if we take all of the data into our </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>

106
00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 1>there are a couple of factors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>really stand out.</v>

107
00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.650
<v Speaker 1>One of them is taxes</v>

108
00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.463
<v Speaker 1>in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 600,000 people moved from the 25 </v>

109
00:06:02.381 --> 00:06:06.490
<v Speaker 1>states with the highest access to the 25</v>
<v Speaker 1>states with the lowest taxes.</v>

110
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.860
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 25 states with the highest taxes,</v>

111
00:06:08.861 --> 00:06:13.861
<v Speaker 1>no less than 24 has a net immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is they so more Americans leaving.</v>

112
00:06:14.141 --> 00:06:19.090
<v Speaker 1>Then arriving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>displaying while sometimes said internal</v>

113
00:06:19.091 --> 00:06:22.810
<v Speaker 1>migration isn't motivated by the weather</v>
<v Speaker 1>or things like that.</v>

114
00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California does suffer from this deficit</v>

115
00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.370
<v Speaker 1>to state like New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is small,</v>

116
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.480
<v Speaker 1>cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountainous,</v>

117
00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:29.314
<v Speaker 1>and has a narrow coastline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've recorded a surplus since the </v>

118
00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.690
<v Speaker 1>year 2000 and listen up because Rhode </v>
<v Speaker 1>Island for Mon said,</v>

119
00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.553
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts all have much higher taxes</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they lose Americans every year and </v>

120
00:06:39.941 --> 00:06:41.560
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Hampshire is the state.</v>

121
00:06:41.561 --> 00:06:44.140
<v Speaker 1>We're the second lowest taxes in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

122
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 1>Coincidence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh no.</v>

123
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>Runs in the Midwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While South Dakota generally registers a</v>

124
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:54.010
<v Speaker 1>surplus of immigrants from year to year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's neighboring states,</v>

125
00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iowa,</v>

126
00:06:55.121 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>and Minnesota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has higher taxes,</v>

127
00:06:56.921 --> 00:07:00.520
<v Speaker 1>have had migration deficits for five </v>
<v Speaker 1>consecutive years,</v>

128
00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:03.970
<v Speaker 1>and then this Kentucky versus Tennessee </v>
<v Speaker 1>or California versus Nevada,</v>

129
00:07:03.971 --> 00:07:04.804
<v Speaker 1>Texas versus Washington states with </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher taxes lose and states with lower </v>

130
00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:09.780
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>

131
00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:10.613
<v Speaker 4>When</v>

132
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.873
<v Speaker 1>Morris study done by economists from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Treasury Department estimated that when </v>

133
00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:19.450
<v Speaker 1>New Jersey raised at state income tax in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004 by almost two point five points,</v>

134
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:23.200
<v Speaker 1>it caused more than $80 million as to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change residences every year.</v>

135
00:07:23.290 --> 00:07:24.123
<v Speaker 1>That might not seem like much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that residents with </v>

136
00:07:26.231 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>higher rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pay proportionately more taxes.</v>

137
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.150
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second because with taxes come</v>

138
00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:34.900
<v Speaker 1>regulations for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and perhaps especially those that affect</v>

139
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:37.600
<v Speaker 1>housing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see a combination of high property taxes</v>

140
00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:41.740
<v Speaker 1>and several regulations and limitations </v>
<v Speaker 1>make living in one particular state,</v>

141
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.780
<v Speaker 1>much more expensive than living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

142
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:44.673
<v Speaker 1>This is what happens in California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is fed up with housing costs </v>

143
00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:52.780
<v Speaker 1>and taxes are fleeing state in big </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

144
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:56.440
<v Speaker 1>Folks renting an apartment in Las Vegas </v>
<v Speaker 1>or phoenix costs on average,</v>

145
00:07:56.470 --> 00:07:57.303
<v Speaker 1>less than half of the cost of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>apartment in Los Angeles or San </v>

146
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:02.770
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not much housing and a lot of demand led</v>

147
00:08:02.771 --> 00:08:07.771
<v Speaker 1>to incredibly high price and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>this makes moving to another state worth</v>

148
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:13.310
<v Speaker 1>it for many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if they learn less.</v>

149
00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.970
<v Speaker 1>So this has been the case so far and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can see that the effect that all of this</v>

150
00:08:16.971 --> 00:08:20.180
<v Speaker 1>has is very important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>States with a migration,</v>

151
00:08:20.181 --> 00:08:21.014
<v Speaker 1>sepsis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this have also been able to grow more </v>

152
00:08:22.221 --> 00:08:25.130
<v Speaker 1>public because they have more attractive</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies for companies,</v>

153
00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:29.000
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs and we've also seen yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but from now on,</v>

154
00:08:29.030 --> 00:08:31.580
<v Speaker 1>everything indicates that the effects </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be even greater.</v>

155
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.360
<v Speaker 1>This is all thanks to Donald Trump and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the republican party's tax reform.</v>

156
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.283
<v Speaker 1>Listen up</v>

157
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.530
<v Speaker 1>more competition.</v>

158
00:08:45.030 --> 00:08:45.210
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

159
00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.670
<v Speaker 1>may be one of the best things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump has done,</v>

160
00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.690
<v Speaker 1>the fiscal reform at the end of 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only humans,</v>

161
00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.533
<v Speaker 1>improving taxation for companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also boosting competition among the </v>

162
00:08:54.331 --> 00:08:55.410
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Until now,</v>

163
00:08:55.411 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>the federal government subsidized parts </v>
<v Speaker 1>of estates taxes.</v>

164
00:08:58.410 --> 00:08:59.243
<v Speaker 1>This is because they weren't deductible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what you paid to the state was </v>

165
00:09:01.831 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>deducted from the taxes that you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay to the federal government.</v>

166
00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 1>This is something that worked as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive for states to raise taxes.</v>

167
00:09:12.910 --> 00:09:13.743
<v Speaker 1>Tax Reform has limited the situation so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the number of households that can </v>

168
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:21.010
<v Speaker 1>deduct so local and state taxes has </v>
<v Speaker 1>dropped from 42 million homes in 2017 to</v>

169
00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:21.844
<v Speaker 1>about $70,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million in 2018 all while having a </v>

170
00:09:24.190 --> 00:09:25.023
<v Speaker 1>smaller deduction amounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has been the equivalent of an </v>

171
00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:28.534
<v Speaker 1>automatic tax increase in the states </v>
<v Speaker 1>with higher taxes because now that </v>

172
00:09:31.091 --> 00:09:35.170
<v Speaker 1>taxpayers will have to pay the state tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>and practically the entire federal tax.</v>

173
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:39.563
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the calculations of the </v>

174
00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Cato Foundation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tax plan from the state of New York in</v>

175
00:09:43.951 --> 00:09:44.784
<v Speaker 1>2017 would have received a rate of 33 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent on federal income tax and </v>

176
00:09:48.630 --> 00:09:49.463
<v Speaker 1>$30,000 on state and local taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could have decreased federal taxes </v>

177
00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.830
<v Speaker 1>like $10,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is thanks to his deduction at state</v>

178
00:09:55.831 --> 00:09:59.220
<v Speaker 1>and local taxes would have cost $20,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

179
00:09:59.221 --> 00:10:00.054
<v Speaker 1>with the new tax reform though now I </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to pay $30,000 for state and local </v>

180
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:05.400
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 33 percent more.</v>

181
00:10:05.430 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 1>And people really feel that asking,</v>

182
00:10:09.110 --> 00:10:09.943
<v Speaker 1>so now the differences between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>states with the highest taxes in the </v>

183
00:10:12.171 --> 00:10:13.004
<v Speaker 1>states with the lowest taxes is going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be much greater perhaps at the high tax </v>

184
00:10:17.031 --> 00:10:17.864
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't have this federal crutch to prop </v>

185
00:10:19.611 --> 00:10:20.444
<v Speaker 1>up their big spending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They might have to cut taxes to stay </v>

186
00:10:22.491 --> 00:10:25.550
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan as the Wall Street Journal</v>

187
00:10:25.551 --> 00:10:26.384
<v Speaker 1>recently published as a boom in Florida </v>
<v Speaker 1>for wealthy boss who wants to purchase </v>

188
00:10:29.601 --> 00:10:31.850
<v Speaker 1>real estate and to establish their </v>
<v Speaker 1>residents there.</v>

189
00:10:31.910 --> 00:10:33.020
<v Speaker 1>And you know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

190
00:10:33.021 --> 00:10:33.854
<v Speaker 1>it probably has something to do with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that Florida doesn't have a state </v>

191
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:39.890
<v Speaker 1>income tax and that it's property taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>are also relatively low.</v>

192
00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:44.270
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she knew what this all means.</v>

193
00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:45.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means no less than a new era of </v>

194
00:10:47.091 --> 00:10:50.600
<v Speaker 1>competition between the states of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>USA has begun from now on.</v>

195
00:10:50.601 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 1>State governments will feel a lot more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure to manage their budgets well.</v>

196
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.560
<v Speaker 1>The good news is that the evidence </v>
<v Speaker 1>points to this being good for everyone.</v>

197
00:10:57.770 --> 00:10:58.603
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a growing rivalry between states is </v>

198
00:10:59.991 --> 00:11:00.824
<v Speaker 1>beginning to develop behind the scenes a</v>
<v Speaker 1>rivalry to be the most desirable and </v>

199
00:11:03.741 --> 00:11:06.200
<v Speaker 1>affordable place for US citizens to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
