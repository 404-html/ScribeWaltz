1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that the United States is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest energy power on the </v>

2
00:00:03.631 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>planet's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

3
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.170
<v Speaker 1>That's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States has taken the position</v>

4
00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>as the world's largest fossil fuel </v>
<v Speaker 1>producer.</v>

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.290
<v Speaker 1>No other country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even Russia or Saudi Arabia.</v>

6
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Even come close to this North American </v>
<v Speaker 1>giants.</v>

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 1>The golden era of American energy is now</v>
<v Speaker 1>underway.</v>

8
00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.160
<v Speaker 1>This energy revolution is having </v>
<v Speaker 1>important consequences and it's changing</v>

9
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:26.994
<v Speaker 1>politics in the USA and it's also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>topic that we're addressing in this </v>

10
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:34.971
<v Speaker 1>visual politic video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just eight years ago,</v>

11
00:00:39.991 --> 00:00:43.710
<v Speaker 1>the supply of petrol and natural gas was</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest concerns that the USA</v>

12
00:00:43.711 --> 00:00:44.544
<v Speaker 1>had about their future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this wasn't a particularly new </v>

13
00:00:47.071 --> 00:00:47.904
<v Speaker 1>concern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country had been dependent on </v>

14
00:00:49.051 --> 00:00:51.640
<v Speaker 1>foreign petrol and gas for decades.</v>

15
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.213
<v Speaker 2>The other thing is that we have only </v>
<v Speaker 2>leased out and began to explore two </v>

16
00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:07.571
<v Speaker 2>percent of our outer continental shelf </v>
<v Speaker 2>for oil where it is believed by everyone</v>

17
00:01:08.331 --> 00:01:12.110
<v Speaker 2>familiar with that few will and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>source of energy,</v>

18
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.420
<v Speaker 2>that there are vast supplies you have to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be found.</v>

19
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.561
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secondly,</v>

20
00:01:15.561 --> 00:01:18.050
<v Speaker 1>we need an active exploration program in</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

21
00:01:18.051 --> 00:01:18.884
<v Speaker 1>They only way to become less dependent </v>
<v Speaker 1>on foreign sources of crude oil is to </v>

22
00:01:21.471 --> 00:01:26.471
<v Speaker 1>explore at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can easily within seven,</v>

23
00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:30.530
<v Speaker 1>eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years if we put our minds to it,</v>

24
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:31.723
<v Speaker 1>we can eliminate our dependence on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>places in the world that our national </v>

25
00:01:35.631 --> 00:01:36.464
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we don't achieve our independence </v>

26
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.503
<v Speaker 1>from the most important thing we can do </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to make sure we control our own </v>

27
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:47.360
<v Speaker 1>energy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here's what I've done since I've been</v>

28
00:01:47.361 --> 00:01:48.194
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have increased oil production to the </v>

29
00:01:51.771 --> 00:01:52.604
<v Speaker 1>highest levels in 16 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time it was said that the </v>

30
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:55.814
<v Speaker 1>national security over the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rely on being able to ensure the </v>

31
00:01:58.701 --> 00:02:01.910
<v Speaker 1>supply of natural gas and petrol to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry and economy.</v>

32
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.940
<v Speaker 1>That we're so dependent upon it and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

33
00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:09.990
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really easy to do at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

34
00:02:09.991 --> 00:02:10.824
<v Speaker 1>It's possible you might remember this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's seem to be facing an </v>

35
00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.733
<v Speaker 1>imminent decline in fossil fuels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really did seem as if we were about </v>

36
00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 1>to run out of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a quick look at the situation</v>

37
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.170
<v Speaker 1>in the USAID.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back at that time</v>

38
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.093
<v Speaker 1>from the early seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the petro reserves in the United States </v>

39
00:02:27.291 --> 00:02:28.124
<v Speaker 1>were declining year after year </v>
<v Speaker 1>production had dropped by about 50 </v>

40
00:02:31.011 --> 00:02:34.190
<v Speaker 1>percent and even the production of </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas was starting to decline.</v>

41
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.003
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States was quickly running </v>

42
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.014
<v Speaker 1>out of energy resources and they were at</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of having to rely on suppliers </v>

43
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.063
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it's exactly trustworthy in the </v>

44
00:02:44.631 --> 00:02:47.450
<v Speaker 1>opinion of those responsible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>national security.</v>

45
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.270
<v Speaker 1>We are of course talking about countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Saudi Arabia,</v>

46
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:51.143
<v Speaker 1>Russia and Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However things they've changed a lot </v>

47
00:02:54.801 --> 00:02:55.634
<v Speaker 1>since then and as sometimes happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the predictions were wrong and creamed </v>

48
00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:00.570
<v Speaker 1>storage tanks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world all continue,</v>

49
00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:01.503
<v Speaker 3>Phil.</v>

50
00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is happening?</v>

51
00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a closer look at that.</v>

52
00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.333
<v Speaker 1>Petrol power returns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States has gone through an </v>

53
00:03:15.351 --> 00:03:17.990
<v Speaker 1>important energy revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last few years.</v>

54
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.853
<v Speaker 1>Oil production has almost doubled,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the reserves which can be exploited </v>

55
00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.710
<v Speaker 1>guarantee that supply for many years to </v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

56
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Look at this chart that we've taken from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal.</v>

57
00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:31.940
<v Speaker 1>It shows the increase of oil production </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the USA since 2011.</v>

58
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.760
<v Speaker 1>You can probably guess the fact that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>USA has almost doubled.</v>

59
00:03:37.761 --> 00:03:38.594
<v Speaker 1>It's all production is closely related </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the huge drops in oil prices since </v>

60
00:03:42.141 --> 00:03:46.870
<v Speaker 1>2004,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just the petrol.</v>

61
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.320
<v Speaker 1>Something really similar that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened with natural gas as well.</v>

62
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.183
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The US is the world's largest producer </v>

63
00:03:52.931 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>of both of these resources and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can imagine,</v>

64
00:03:55.931 --> 00:03:56.764
<v Speaker 1>this as consequences on multiple fronts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what has happened so that this boom </v>

65
00:04:00.401 --> 00:04:04.430
<v Speaker 1>could take place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As many of you know,</v>

66
00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.780
<v Speaker 1>it is all due to a technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution known as fracking.</v>

67
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually nothing new.</v>

68
00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:14.414
<v Speaker 1>We've known about it for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until recently it wasn't really </v>

69
00:04:17.031 --> 00:04:18.770
<v Speaker 1>economically viable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

70
00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>before we get into this topic any </v>
<v Speaker 1>further,</v>

71
00:04:20.301 --> 00:04:21.134
<v Speaker 1>we need to point out that fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty controversial topic and </v>

72
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:28.340
<v Speaker 1>for now it's only used to produce petrol</v>
<v Speaker 1>on a large scale in four countries,</v>

73
00:04:28.341 --> 00:04:29.480
<v Speaker 1>the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

74
00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:31.070
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Argentina.</v>

75
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:33.110
<v Speaker 1>At the end of this video and in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description below,</v>

76
00:04:33.111 --> 00:04:33.944
<v Speaker 1>we're actually going to leave a link to </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that will explain how this </v>

77
00:04:35.961 --> 00:04:36.794
<v Speaker 1>process works in its defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would also like to point out that it is </v>

78
00:04:39.021 --> 00:04:42.320
<v Speaker 1>a pretty new technique and as this </v>
<v Speaker 1>technique is being used and developed,</v>

79
00:04:42.321 --> 00:04:44.900
<v Speaker 1>its actual impact is being reduced </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>

80
00:04:44.901 --> 00:04:45.734
<v Speaker 1>The safety and that sort of thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually a discussion for another video </v>

81
00:04:48.141 --> 00:04:48.974
<v Speaker 1>because in this video we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>focus on both the economic and the </v>

82
00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:56.261
<v Speaker 1>political consequences of fracking </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding the economic engine.</v>

83
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.903
<v Speaker 1>Civil oil imports to the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S had been reduced significantly in the </v>

84
00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:05.143
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sanders laws of supply and demand </v>

85
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:09.700
<v Speaker 1>applying all of this additional petrol </v>
<v Speaker 1>has made the prices drop.</v>

86
00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>This means the lesser amounts of petrol </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the country is still important,</v>

87
00:05:13.110 --> 00:05:18.110
<v Speaker 1>but it's also significantly the price of</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas slash petrol at the pump to faults,</v>

88
00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.380
<v Speaker 1>so much so that it's actually estimated </v>
<v Speaker 1>that American consumers are saving about</v>

89
00:05:25.381 --> 00:05:26.214
<v Speaker 1>a $150,000,000,000 every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is money that is then used for </v>

90
00:05:30.061 --> 00:05:30.894
<v Speaker 1>purchasing other products or setting up </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses or just putting it into a </v>

91
00:05:33.031 --> 00:05:36.540
<v Speaker 1>savings accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute because this is not</v>

92
00:05:36.541 --> 00:05:38.610
<v Speaker 1>the end of today's story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

93
00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:39.473
<v Speaker 1>not even close,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper petrol and gas also benefits </v>

94
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.390
<v Speaker 1>industry and not just those industries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that use this type of energy,</v>

95
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.900
<v Speaker 1>but also industry that uses it as their </v>
<v Speaker 1>raw material.</v>

96
00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 3>Of course</v>

97
00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 1>now talking about the petro chemical </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

98
00:05:54.131 --> 00:05:54.964
<v Speaker 1>the one that produces plastic and pvc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the culmination of a large quantity of </v>

99
00:06:05.251 --> 00:06:06.084
<v Speaker 1>petrol available,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the certainty of supply and low prices </v>

100
00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.903
<v Speaker 1>are triggering an industrial boom in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>petro chemical sector and it's really </v>

101
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:13.193
<v Speaker 1>important to look at these numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>closely because that absolutely huge </v>

102
00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.233
<v Speaker 1>petrochemical sector is developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects valued at $185 billion dollars </v>

103
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 1>just in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 16.</v>

104
00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:29.813
<v Speaker 1>These sorts of projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're 50 percent of the entire national </v>

105
00:06:32.281 --> 00:06:33.114
<v Speaker 1>industrial investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's expected that these investments </v>

106
00:06:35.101 --> 00:06:38.030
<v Speaker 1>will turn the United States into a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>plastic export</v>

107
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 1>just so I can get an idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They expect that in just a few years,</v>

108
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:44.374
<v Speaker 1>the net exports of petrol based products</v>
<v Speaker 1>like plastics and also fertilizes and </v>

109
00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:52.000
<v Speaker 1>solvents will exceed $110,000,000,000 a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

110
00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:54.640
<v Speaker 1>This is almost as much as all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>petrol,</v>

111
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.653
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to pinch yourself sometimes </v>

112
00:06:58.991 --> 00:07:01.360
<v Speaker 1>and say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the envy of the world.</v>

113
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:02.253
<v Speaker 1>Neal Chapman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the chemical division at </v>

114
00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:04.643
<v Speaker 1>Exxonmobil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not your business will certainly </v>

115
00:07:06.041 --> 00:07:06.874
<v Speaker 1>help us reduce that trade deficits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a deficit that trump is always </v>

116
00:07:09.731 --> 00:07:12.160
<v Speaker 1>complaining about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's wait a second because,</v>

117
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:14.560
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's yet more the supply of petrol.</v>

118
00:07:14.561 --> 00:07:15.394
<v Speaker 1>It's something no longer a priority or a</v>
<v Speaker 1>concern for the countries and national </v>

119
00:07:18.011 --> 00:07:18.844
<v Speaker 1>security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In December 2015 us Congress moved the </v>

120
00:07:21.641 --> 00:07:24.220
<v Speaker 1>prohibition on exports of natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>and petrol.</v>

121
00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:25.400
<v Speaker 3>Now</v>

122
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.540
<v Speaker 1>the US is about to become a net exporter</v>
<v Speaker 1>of natural gas and it is calculated that</v>

123
00:07:29.541 --> 00:07:34.541
<v Speaker 1>the US will sell an average of 1 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>petrol barrels per day in 2017.</v>

124
00:07:36.410 --> 00:07:40.160
<v Speaker 1>US oil exports double reshaping vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>global markets.</v>

125
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:41.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States still important forum </v>

126
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:43.423
<v Speaker 1>petrol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but much less than it used to because </v>

127
00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.890
<v Speaker 1>countries like to have energy security </v>
<v Speaker 1>by diversifying their sources.</v>

128
00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:49.753
<v Speaker 1>Many countries are willing to pay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>premium for this US supply and you can </v>

129
00:07:53.361 --> 00:07:54.194
<v Speaker 1>be sure that the companies in the US on </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking advantage of that natural gas </v>

130
00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:06.040
<v Speaker 1>where this change has been the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so recently the transport of gas was</v>

131
00:08:06.041 --> 00:08:08.680
<v Speaker 1>difficult and huge gas pipelines when </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed,</v>

132
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:12.040
<v Speaker 1>but now thanks to the new technology of </v>
<v Speaker 1>liquefied natural gas,</v>

133
00:08:12.070 --> 00:08:15.010
<v Speaker 1>it can easily be transported like petrol</v>
<v Speaker 1>in giant</v>

134
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.983
<v Speaker 3>tankers.</v>

135
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.423
<v Speaker 1>The gas supplied this way is almost half</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world's supply and here American </v>

136
00:08:23.941 --> 00:08:24.774
<v Speaker 1>companies are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The superstars is now projected to be </v>

137
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the top three natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>exporters in the world by 20,</v>

138
00:08:35.901 --> 00:08:37.760
<v Speaker 1>20 less importance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gas Exports,</v>

139
00:08:37.761 --> 00:08:38.594
<v Speaker 1>a revival of the industrial sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all looks like rather bad timing for </v>

140
00:08:42.201 --> 00:08:46.580
<v Speaker 1>trump's protectionism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

141
00:08:46.581 --> 00:08:48.770
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a minute because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>energy revolution,</v>

142
00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:53.830
<v Speaker 1>it also has political consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomatically.</v>

143
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.343
<v Speaker 1>Most of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to understand the US international </v>

144
00:09:05.431 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we don't consider the impacts of this</v>

145
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:10.060
<v Speaker 1>energy revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me explain.</v>

146
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.993
<v Speaker 1>I'll console now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The supply of petrol was a priority for </v>

147
00:09:13.171 --> 00:09:14.004
<v Speaker 1>national security.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Middle East and oil and gas </v>

148
00:09:15.481 --> 00:09:19.210
<v Speaker 1>producing countries had an important </v>
<v Speaker 1>role in the American diplomatic agenda.</v>

149
00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:20.233
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

150
00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>petrol scheme of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This caused priorities to change.</v>

151
00:09:24.691 --> 00:09:27.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new focus has been placed on Asia,</v>

152
00:09:27.090 --> 00:09:30.300
<v Speaker 1>which is we've talked about before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a goldmine of opportunity</v>

153
00:09:33.390 --> 00:09:35.310
<v Speaker 1>singly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without this change in priorities,</v>

154
00:09:35.330 --> 00:09:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Obama would have probably kept the </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops in Iraq ends.</v>

155
00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.950
<v Speaker 1>The situation in Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libya or Syria would have been very,</v>

156
00:09:40.951 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>very different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be really extra clear.</v>

157
00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:44.433
<v Speaker 1>Have all of this petroleum means that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East is not really that </v>

158
00:09:46.861 --> 00:09:47.694
<v Speaker 1>important to the United States anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A country that can now even afford to </v>

159
00:09:50.551 --> 00:09:54.480
<v Speaker 1>support these so called Arab Nato,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something pretty much like,</v>

160
00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:55.373
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you and take care of your own </v>

161
00:09:56.521 --> 00:09:57.354
<v Speaker 1>safety man's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every now and then we'll give you a </v>

162
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 1>hands to hopefully avoid the risk of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>global crisis or something.</v>

163
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.363
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this energy independence has also given </v>

164
00:10:06.511 --> 00:10:07.344
<v Speaker 1>Washington the opportunity to place more</v>
<v Speaker 1>demands on the petro monarchies of the </v>

165
00:10:11.100 --> 00:10:11.933
<v Speaker 1>Persian Gulf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to human </v>

166
00:10:12.811 --> 00:10:14.280
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

167
00:10:14.281 --> 00:10:16.650
<v Speaker 1>if there is something that is absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>certain,</v>

168
00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.513
<v Speaker 1>it is trump's support for fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new president and wants to continue </v>

169
00:10:20.551 --> 00:10:22.370
<v Speaker 1>Obama's work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to do it faster,</v>

170
00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.290
<v Speaker 1>eliminating any obstacle that might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the way.</v>

171
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.353
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

172
00:10:28.530 --> 00:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>American Energy First America</v>

173
00:10:32.450 --> 00:10:35.660
<v Speaker 4>first,</v>
<v Speaker 4>America first.</v>

174
00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:36.713
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump has little doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He made the promise during his campaign </v>

175
00:10:39.151 --> 00:10:42.060
<v Speaker 1>and has kept his word since taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>office is priority,</v>

176
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:44.430
<v Speaker 1>has been to give petrol and gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments,</v>

177
00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:45.413
<v Speaker 1>the green light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things he promised to </v>

178
00:10:47.071 --> 00:10:49.680
<v Speaker 1>eliminate many of the rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions Obama passed,</v>

179
00:10:49.681 --> 00:10:52.170
<v Speaker 1>which could cause fracking to slow down </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump well.</v>

180
00:10:52.171 --> 00:10:56.820
<v Speaker 1>He wants cheap petrol panties willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>push to get it sooner rather than later.</v>

181
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:57.713
<v Speaker 1>Trump has also chosen to surround </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself with key people closely related </v>

182
00:11:00.751 --> 00:11:05.550
<v Speaker 1>to the petroleum industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Secretary of state's trump decided to</v>

183
00:11:05.551 --> 00:11:08.580
<v Speaker 1>go for rex Tillerson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who used to be the CEO of Exxon Mobil.</v>

184
00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Then there's Rick Perry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former governor of Texas,</v>

185
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:15.490
<v Speaker 1>who has been placed in charge of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Department of Energy.</v>

186
00:11:15.491 --> 00:11:16.324
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a stage that is very closely </v>

187
00:11:17.651 --> 00:11:18.484
<v Speaker 1>related to the industry and then there </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the head of the US Environmental </v>

188
00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:24.793
<v Speaker 1>Protection Agency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scott Pruitt to the attorney general in </v>

189
00:11:25.761 --> 00:11:27.130
<v Speaker 1>Oklahoma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another state,</v>

190
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.330
<v Speaker 1>well connected to the petroleum </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

191
00:11:29.370 --> 00:11:30.203
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

192
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:31.883
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a revolution that the US is </v>

193
00:11:33.241 --> 00:11:34.074
<v Speaker 1>going through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did some revolution that just put </v>

194
00:11:35.191 --> 00:11:36.790
<v Speaker 1>greater limits on the power of.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

195
00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.960
<v Speaker 1>now there is no question that fracking </v>
<v Speaker 1>has its risks,</v>

196
00:11:42.961 --> 00:11:46.740
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is is that it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology that's not going anywhere and</v>

197
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:50.850
<v Speaker 1>it does seem that with time and </v>
<v Speaker 1>development it's going to become safer,</v>

198
00:11:50.910 --> 00:11:51.743
<v Speaker 1>but until that time comes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>environmental controls are absolutely </v>

199
00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:55.613
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

200
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.330
<v Speaker 1>and now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to know what you think of this</v>

201
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:04.360
<v Speaker 1>energy revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's the start of a new era</v>

202
00:12:04.361 --> 00:12:05.194
<v Speaker 1>for cheap petrol?</v>
