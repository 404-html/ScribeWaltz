1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.470
<v Speaker 1>No way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's famous for its extreme climates,</v>

2
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:11.304
<v Speaker 1>have long sunny summer days and long </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark winter nights as well as the </v>

3
00:00:14.341 --> 00:00:19.341
<v Speaker 1>extreme cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so famous for their welfare state,</v>

4
00:00:20.251 --> 00:00:22.560
<v Speaker 1>like any other Nordic country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps most of all,</v>

5
00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>they're famous for this smoked salmon</v>

6
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.280
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just us that visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>

7
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.123
<v Speaker 1>You think that it's actually the fishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry is one of the most modern and </v>

8
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:34.810
<v Speaker 1>important in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

9
00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.733
<v Speaker 1>in the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most significant element of the </v>

10
00:00:37.301 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian identity has been its </v>
<v Speaker 1>commitment to the environment,</v>

11
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:42.543
<v Speaker 1>especially its fight against climate </v>
<v Speaker 1>change and there is no better place for </v>

12
00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.910
<v Speaker 1>us to see this than in their adoption of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electric car.</v>

13
00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:49.773
<v Speaker 1>You see Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the most developed market of </v>

14
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:51.874
<v Speaker 1>electric cars in the world in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll find that one of every two cars </v>

15
00:00:54.731 --> 00:00:57.010
<v Speaker 1>sold is either electric or it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hybrid,</v>

16
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>but it's even more to this because by </v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

17
00:00:59.411 --> 00:01:01.950
<v Speaker 1>25,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is kind of basically tomorrow,</v>

18
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Norway expects to stop selling gas or </v>
<v Speaker 1>diesel powered cars altogether.</v>

19
00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:09.700
<v Speaker 1>They only want to sell electric and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hybrid cars.</v>

20
00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might be pretty hard to imagine,</v>

21
00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:12.190
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:13.023
<v Speaker 1>it's been a hundred years of combustion </v>
<v Speaker 1>engines and it all seems as if he's </v>

23
00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:17.890
<v Speaker 1>about to come to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East,</v>

24
00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.903
<v Speaker 2>Norway,</v>

25
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.150
<v Speaker 1>they're electric car mania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

26
00:01:23.151 --> 00:01:23.984
<v Speaker 1>it's even reached ships to companies are</v>
<v Speaker 1>currently developing a project called </v>

27
00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
<v Speaker 1>Tesla over the seas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's goal is to launch the first </v>

28
00:01:30.271 --> 00:01:33.420
<v Speaker 1>autonomous ship that's powered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric batteries.</v>

29
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>The first Yara Berkland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the formal name of the project.</v>

30
00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.510
<v Speaker 1>It's expected to be ready by the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>2018,</v>

31
00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>and this might all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're wondering,</v>

32
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's Norway Secrets?</v>

33
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>How on earth they made electric cars </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite so popular?</v>

34
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>Is it really all to do about just </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern for the environment?</v>

35
00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean maybe that is a positive,</v>

36
00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.290
<v Speaker 1>but if we're honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the majority reason,</v>

37
00:01:58.291 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a little less idealistic.</v>

38
00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.583
<v Speaker 1>The key for this electric Colombian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got everything to do with the tax </v>

39
00:02:04.951 --> 00:02:05.784
<v Speaker 1>incentives that the government has </v>
<v Speaker 1>granted in order to support the </v>

40
00:02:08.221 --> 00:02:09.310
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So look,</v>

41
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.190
<v Speaker 1>in Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you choose to buy a vehicle,</v>

42
00:02:11.191 --> 00:02:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you can actually save an enormous amount</v>
<v Speaker 1>in taxes.</v>

43
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:16.170
<v Speaker 1>If you choose to go for an electric </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle,</v>

44
00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.400
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for one,</v>

45
00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:21.780
<v Speaker 1>you don't pay any VAT and in Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's 25 percent right off the bat,</v>

46
00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.040
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to pay any registration </v>
<v Speaker 1>fees or any other additional taxes.</v>

47
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.600
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this all sounds well and good,</v>

48
00:02:27.601 --> 00:02:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but what is the actual results of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>all financial.</v>

49
00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.460
<v Speaker 1>So according to a recent study,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you got this car,</v>

50
00:02:34.461 --> 00:02:38.660
<v Speaker 1>the Tesla model s.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now if this was a regular gas car,</v>

51
00:02:38.661 --> 00:02:40.640
<v Speaker 1>if you included all the taxes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything else,</v>

52
00:02:40.641 --> 00:02:44.330
<v Speaker 1>this thing in noise going to set you </v>
<v Speaker 1>back about $140,000,</v>

53
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.390
<v Speaker 1>but thanks to the tax relief of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian government,</v>

54
00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.450
<v Speaker 1>this is actually around $70,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 50 percent in savings,</v>

55
00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.080
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty amazing.</v>

56
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.123
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

57
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's not even mentioning the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantages.</v>

58
00:02:58.621 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>I mean these costs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to pay for any tolls and</v>

59
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:01.804
<v Speaker 1>they don't have to pay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Parking meters will say there's another </v>

60
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 1>major advantage because in Norway </v>
<v Speaker 1>electricity it's mostly hydroelectric,</v>

61
00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.030
<v Speaker 1>which means well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's both cheap and it's clean.</v>

62
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:10.933
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as a result of these policies and </v>

63
00:03:12.371 --> 00:03:13.204
<v Speaker 1>some of the policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government expects to reduce total </v>

64
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:18.250
<v Speaker 1>carbon emissions by 40 percent in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next few years.</v>

65
00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:19.453
<v Speaker 1>If you consider all of these advantages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like being able to get a test liver 70 </v>

66
00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:22.684
<v Speaker 1>grands ams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that it has one of the highest </v>

67
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:26.470
<v Speaker 1>living standards in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be thinking right now,</v>

68
00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:29.050
<v Speaker 1>well Norway sounds like a pretty amazing</v>
<v Speaker 1>place,</v>

69
00:03:29.051 --> 00:03:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but taking things back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment for a minute,</v>

70
00:03:30.761 --> 00:03:31.594
<v Speaker 1>the Norwegian constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it even actually protect the </v>

71
00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:36.190
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider Article One hundred and 10.</v>

72
00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.893
<v Speaker 1>Every person has a right to an </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment that is conducive to health </v>

73
00:03:40.691 --> 00:03:41.524
<v Speaker 1>and to a natural environment who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity and diversity are </v>

74
00:03:43.631 --> 00:03:44.320
<v Speaker 1>maintained.</v>

75
00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.153
<v Speaker 1>Natural resources should be managed on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the basis of comprehensive longterm </v>

76
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.330
<v Speaker 1>considerations whereby this right will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be safeguarded for future generations as</v>

77
00:03:52.331 --> 00:03:55.780
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Article One hundred and 10 B of Norway's</v>

78
00:03:55.781 --> 00:03:56.930
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

79
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>so as always in one of these videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not everything is sunshine and lollipops</v>

80
00:04:02.081 --> 00:04:02.914
<v Speaker 1>and rainbows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So noise is this really wealthy country </v>

81
00:04:05.111 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>and they've got this really big welfare </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

82
00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.343
<v Speaker 1>but they do have a small issue or </v>
<v Speaker 1>released a problem that makes green </v>

83
00:04:11.891 --> 00:04:14.200
<v Speaker 1>beast really angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this issue,</v>

84
00:04:14.201 --> 00:04:17.470
<v Speaker 1>it is about the oil production of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway.</v>

85
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:19.150
<v Speaker 1>But now the question really has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become,</v>

86
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:21.700
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how oil dependent is Norway?</v>

87
00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at that.</v>

88
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.780
<v Speaker 1>Oil addicts,</v>

89
00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>we can take a time machine back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 20th century,</v>

90
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:36.460
<v Speaker 1>we would find Norway with a really basic</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

91
00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:38.320
<v Speaker 1>All they did was fishing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing,</v>

92
00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:39.580
<v Speaker 1>and fishing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

93
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.414
<v Speaker 1>if we traveled forward in time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though things did improve </v>

94
00:04:42.281 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 1>significantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway during the 19 sixties,</v>

95
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.100
<v Speaker 1>no way included in the list of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's wealthiest countries,</v>

96
00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

97
00:04:49.301 --> 00:04:52.120
<v Speaker 1>its per capita income was around half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland's,</v>

98
00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:53.493
<v Speaker 1>1960.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The standard of living in Norway was </v>

99
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:57.970
<v Speaker 1>about 30 or 40 percent lower than in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden or Denmark.</v>

100
00:04:58.030 --> 00:04:58.863
<v Speaker 1>Now the standard of living in Norway is </v>
<v Speaker 1>substantially higher than those who </v>

101
00:05:01.301 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>countries renewal guerard and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economists,</v>

102
00:05:03.401 --> 00:05:07.480
<v Speaker 1>the Norwegian business school in Oslo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the obvious question becomes,</v>

103
00:05:07.481 --> 00:05:08.261
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens?</v>

104
00:05:08.261 --> 00:05:09.094
<v Speaker 1>In what way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did it become one of the richest </v>

105
00:05:10.181 --> 00:05:11.014
<v Speaker 1>countries on earth in so little time </v>
<v Speaker 1>where everything began to change in the </v>

106
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 69.</v>

107
00:05:16.121 --> 00:05:20.440
<v Speaker 1>This was the year when the first oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves were found and the as the ad,</v>

108
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:22.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been a bit of a golden age.</v>

109
00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:26.020
<v Speaker 1>The country became one of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest oil and natural gas suppliers.</v>

110
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.913
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this oil revolution means tons of </v>

111
00:05:29.231 --> 00:05:30.064
<v Speaker 1>money coming in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that contributed to building the </v>

112
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Norway that we know today,</v>

113
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.940
<v Speaker 1>today oil and natural gas are the keys </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this country's economy.</v>

114
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.530
<v Speaker 1>In 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

115
00:05:42.531 --> 00:05:43.364
<v Speaker 1>almost 40 percent of exports and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a fifth of investment had its </v>

116
00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.600
<v Speaker 1>origin in the oil and gas sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course I mean governments.</v>

117
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.020
<v Speaker 1>It's getting it's share depending on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>year and the prices of gasoline.</v>

118
00:05:54.021 --> 00:05:54.854
<v Speaker 1>All the income that the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>obtains from this industry route one of </v>

119
00:05:57.831 --> 00:06:02.600
<v Speaker 1>every 41 of every six euros of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's total tax collection,</v>

120
00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.490
<v Speaker 1>and I want to give them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He gets a ton of money.</v>

121
00:06:04.491 --> 00:06:06.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that usually means an increase in public</v>

122
00:06:06.561 --> 00:06:07.394
<v Speaker 1>spending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>World's most generous welfare state </v>

123
00:06:09.771 --> 00:06:11.780
<v Speaker 1>leaves 20 percent on the Dole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

124
00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:14.030
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To a certain extent,</v>

125
00:06:14.031 --> 00:06:14.864
<v Speaker 1>we could say the Norwegian model of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge welfare state with public control </v>

126
00:06:17.961 --> 00:06:21.650
<v Speaker 1>of many of the large companies has a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with oil.</v>

127
00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tumbling all of the pros of this raw</v>

128
00:06:23.721 --> 00:06:24.554
<v Speaker 1>material has led the government to take </v>
<v Speaker 1>an incredibly controversial measure for </v>

129
00:06:28.011 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>the first time in 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Norwegian government,</v>

130
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.063
<v Speaker 1>it's granting new exploration licenses </v>
<v Speaker 1>in particular tenure instances of oil </v>

131
00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.140
<v Speaker 1>exploration in the Barents Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the heart of the artist.</v>

132
00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:38.993
<v Speaker 2>Exactly</v>

133
00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:47.663
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this movement has made Greenpeace and </v>

134
00:06:49.171 --> 00:06:51.540
<v Speaker 1>other environmental organizations </v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

135
00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:55.050
<v Speaker 1>really angry great days by the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've taken the government to court,</v>

136
00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:57.870
<v Speaker 1>accusing them of violating the Paris </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements and also,</v>

137
00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:58.783
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violating the Norwegian constitution </v>

138
00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:02.130
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we just told you a moment ago,</v>

139
00:07:02.131 --> 00:07:02.964
<v Speaker 1>the environment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty well protected in Norwegian </v>

140
00:07:04.681 --> 00:07:05.514
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the thing is Norway's green </v>

141
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:08.540
<v Speaker 1>commitments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

142
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>this is set in limitations knowing has </v>
<v Speaker 1>set out to be a global leader in climate</v>

143
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:13.884
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet continued expansion of oil and gas </v>

144
00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:16.434
<v Speaker 1>production could eclipse the benefits of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway's domestic emission reductions </v>

145
00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:20.363
<v Speaker 1>efforts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Erickson as senior scientists </v>

146
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:24.570
<v Speaker 1>within the Stockholm Environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute and well,</v>

147
00:07:24.571 --> 00:07:27.090
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that the world's largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare state,</v>

148
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:32.120
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly does not come cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We as a country are petro holics.</v>

149
00:07:32.790 --> 00:07:34.890
<v Speaker 1>We depend so much on the income from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

150
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.720
<v Speaker 1>Just like alcoholics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to stop,</v>

151
00:07:36.721 --> 00:07:37.554
<v Speaker 1>but we don't know how Thomas Nielsen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>editor of the independent parents </v>

152
00:07:40.111 --> 00:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>observer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>

153
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.673
<v Speaker 1>but,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wait for a minute because it is not </v>

154
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:47.340
<v Speaker 1>like Norway is like some of those other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that also rely on oil.</v>

155
00:07:47.341 --> 00:07:48.174
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway is dependent on oil to a certain </v>

156
00:07:50.941 --> 00:07:53.370
<v Speaker 1>extent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not even close to how dependent</v>

157
00:07:53.371 --> 00:07:57.050
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela or Saudi Arabia are honest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway things.</v>

158
00:07:57.070 --> 00:08:00.360
<v Speaker 1>They are totally different now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the government does carry a lot</v>

159
00:08:00.361 --> 00:08:01.194
<v Speaker 1>of economic weight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway has tried to be open to business </v>

160
00:08:03.571 --> 00:08:04.404
<v Speaker 1>and they have tried to use this oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to fund productive activities and </v>

161
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:11.970
<v Speaker 1>provide a quality education.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have also been incredibly committed</v>

162
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.833
<v Speaker 1>to saving</v>

163
00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:17.860
<v Speaker 1>fund of funds</v>

164
00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:19.520
<v Speaker 2>for</v>

165
00:08:19.520 --> 00:08:22.310
<v Speaker 1>a country that has made so much money </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the oil industry.</v>

166
00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Norway is very different to what we are </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to the capital city.</v>

167
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:28.700
<v Speaker 1>It's not overtaken by skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive malls,</v>

168
00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:30.440
<v Speaker 1>extravagant complexes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

169
00:08:30.470 --> 00:08:32.120
<v Speaker 1>don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have spent a lot of money,</v>

170
00:08:32.121 --> 00:08:34.910
<v Speaker 1>but the key to Norway is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't wasted it.</v>

171
00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.610
<v Speaker 1>The Norwegian government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they make this really sensible decision.</v>

172
00:08:37.611 --> 00:08:39.950
<v Speaker 1>They decided to save a lot of their oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

173
00:08:39.980 --> 00:08:40.813
<v Speaker 1>They set up a sovereign wealth funds at </v>
<v Speaker 1>to invest the money and buy assets all </v>

174
00:08:44.031 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 1>around the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is the biggest sovereign wealth</v>

175
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 1>fund on Earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even Saudi Arabia,</v>

176
00:08:50.331 --> 00:08:52.820
<v Speaker 1>not even Kuwait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have saved so much.</v>

177
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:53.713
<v Speaker 1>Now consider this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway sovereign wealth fund hits </v>

178
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:58.080
<v Speaker 1>$1,000,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.900
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a trillion dollars.</v>

180
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a fortunate of around $190,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>per Norwegian citizens.</v>

181
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Instead of wasting this money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they invested it in companies all around</v>

182
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:09.690
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

183
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:14.010
<v Speaker 1>This fund is invested money or more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>9,000 companies in 78 countries.</v>

184
00:09:14.040 --> 00:09:16.650
<v Speaker 1>Some of these companies really famous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Your apple,</v>

185
00:09:16.651 --> 00:09:18.030
<v Speaker 1>Nestle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shell alphabet.</v>

186
00:09:18.031 --> 00:09:20.010
<v Speaker 1>That's better known as Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

187
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 1>We could save that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Norwegians,</v>

188
00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:22.703
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even own a part of Youtube and you </v>

189
00:09:24.361 --> 00:09:25.194
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of their targets is to eventually </v>

190
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:31.050
<v Speaker 1>replace that oil income with income from</v>
<v Speaker 1>these investments.</v>

191
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:33.300
<v Speaker 1>I mean these are investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they produce profit.</v>

192
00:09:33.301 --> 00:09:34.134
<v Speaker 1>It's what they do and these prophets </v>
<v Speaker 1>have been a return of about five point </v>

193
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:38.454
<v Speaker 1>seven percent a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if these levels of return will speak </v>

194
00:09:40.471 --> 00:09:41.304
<v Speaker 1>at the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway would have an average of </v>

195
00:09:42.481 --> 00:09:43.314
<v Speaker 1>$50,000,000,000 in profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is equivalent to about 25 percent </v>

196
00:09:46.531 --> 00:09:48.810
<v Speaker 1>of their public spending starting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sound pretty good.</v>

197
00:09:48.811 --> 00:09:50.100
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on top of all of that,</v>

198
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:50.934
<v Speaker 1>of course there's the income that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government gets from oil and local </v>

199
00:09:53.041 --> 00:09:53.874
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that despite being state </v>

200
00:09:55.210 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 1>homes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do work with market criteria are.</v>

201
00:09:57.610 --> 00:09:58.443
<v Speaker 1>So it's still looking pretty rosy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you might be thinking right now </v>

202
00:10:00.211 --> 00:10:02.580
<v Speaker 1>that Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does it have to worry about,</v>

203
00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:05.250
<v Speaker 1>but hold on for just a moment because </v>
<v Speaker 1>the welfare level,</v>

204
00:10:05.251 --> 00:10:06.084
<v Speaker 1>it does seem to have a solid base,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the government is absolutely </v>

205
00:10:08.041 --> 00:10:08.874
<v Speaker 1>determined to achieve economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversification in order to have a more </v>

206
00:10:12.331 --> 00:10:13.164
<v Speaker 1>competitive economy so that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimately get rid of their dependency </v>

207
00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:17.243
<v Speaker 1>on oil.</v>

208
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:22.610
<v Speaker 2>The reforms.</v>

209
00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:26.330
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>27.</v>

210
00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>The center left party has been the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular in general elections,</v>

211
00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:32.620
<v Speaker 1>but in Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely majority's.</v>

212
00:10:32.650 --> 00:10:35.810
<v Speaker 1>They're not really common in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a coalition of center,</v>

213
00:10:35.811 --> 00:10:36.644
<v Speaker 1>right wing parties like the progress bar</v>
<v Speaker 1>see famous for its radical position on </v>

214
00:10:39.321 --> 00:10:42.170
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Managed to put Erna Solberg in office.</v>

215
00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.033
<v Speaker 1>She is known as the Norwegian version of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Angela Merkel in the recent elections </v>

216
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.160
<v Speaker 1>that happened on the 11th of September </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

217
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:52.030
<v Speaker 1>This coalition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when it was reelected and the intensive,</v>

218
00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:52.873
<v Speaker 1>this government is to get some distance </v>
<v Speaker 1>from what has become known as the </v>

219
00:10:55.881 --> 00:10:57.590
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>

220
00:10:57.591 --> 00:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>they want to improve the competitiveness</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country by reducing taxes,</v>

221
00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:03.410
<v Speaker 1>especially for companies both public and</v>
<v Speaker 1>private,</v>

222
00:11:03.411 --> 00:11:07.070
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time they also intend to</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep developing the oil industry</v>

223
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 2>anyway anyway,</v>

224
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:17.340
<v Speaker 1>if they are sure about something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Norway,</v>

225
00:11:17.370 --> 00:11:18.203
<v Speaker 1>it is the innovation and development are</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best ways to obtain high standards </v>

226
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:25.830
<v Speaker 1>of living and improve the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well now it is your turn.</v>

227
00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.693
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should be this example of something </v>

228
00:11:28.501 --> 00:11:30.720
<v Speaker 1>to be followed in the management of </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural resources?</v>
