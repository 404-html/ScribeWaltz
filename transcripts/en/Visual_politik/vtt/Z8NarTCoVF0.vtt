00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.080
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 2>He's a politician,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he's not just any politician.</v>

3
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.153
<v Speaker 2>His biography is what you'd expect from </v>
<v Speaker 2>the protagonist of a best selling </v>

4
00:00:15.551 --> 00:00:16.980
<v Speaker 2>political fiction novel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

5
00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.853
<v Speaker 2>the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a flesh and blood politician </v>

6
00:00:20.081 --> 00:00:22.570
<v Speaker 2>with both the good side and the dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>side.</v>

7
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.500
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about Benjamin Netanyahu,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel's prime minister,</v>

8
00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:27.363
<v Speaker 2>and it's the most powerful politician in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country has had in the last two </v>

9
00:00:29.921 --> 00:00:30.754
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

10
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.880
<v Speaker 3>This is a country that works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People work the invent things,</v>

11
00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.270
<v Speaker 3>and when things that change live,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is past is future.</v>

12
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.613
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I found in the Times that I've been in </v>

13
00:00:45.061 --> 00:00:45.894
<v Speaker 3>government that the most rapid </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology transfers occur when </v>

14
00:00:49.831 --> 00:00:53.700
<v Speaker 3>businesses operate within Israel is </v>
<v Speaker 3>often called the startup nation.</v>

15
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.893
<v Speaker 3>I call it the innovation nation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The future belongs to those who </v>

16
00:00:59.731 --> 00:01:00.564
<v Speaker 3>innovate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Those who don't innovate rather than </v>

17
00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 3>companies or in countries will fall </v>
<v Speaker 3>behind.</v>

18
00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.183
<v Speaker 3>Innovation is the only way to </v>
<v Speaker 3>consistently add value to your products </v>

19
00:01:10.591 --> 00:01:14.490
<v Speaker 3>and services in an increasingly </v>
<v Speaker 3>competitive global economy.</v>

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.220
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may be wondering,</v>

21
00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.560
<v Speaker 2>why are we talking about Netanyahu </v>
<v Speaker 2>today?</v>

22
00:01:21.561 --> 00:01:23.780
<v Speaker 2>Why is he so important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

23
00:01:23.781 --> 00:01:26.120
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what if I told you that this man was the</v>

24
00:01:26.121 --> 00:01:26.954
<v Speaker 2>architect?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He basically designs the Israel that we </v>

25
00:01:28.941 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 2>know today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

26
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 2>you heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

27
00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.023
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a politician who has</v>
<v Speaker 2>so much character that he actually </v>

28
00:01:34.671 --> 00:01:35.504
<v Speaker 2>attacked the very presidents of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States in front of his own </v>

29
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:39.110
<v Speaker 2>congress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

30
00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.030
<v Speaker 2>indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happened to Barack Obama,</v>

31
00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 2>so don't tell me that this guy isn't</v>

32
00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.670
<v Speaker 3>huff before lifting those restrictions,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world should demand that you long to</v>

33
00:01:47.671 --> 00:01:50.230
<v Speaker 3>do three things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First,</v>

34
00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 3>stop.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's aggression against its neighbors in</v>

35
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 3>the Middle East.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Second,</v>

36
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 3>stopped supporting terrorism around the </v>
<v Speaker 3>world,</v>

37
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.543
<v Speaker 3>and third,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stop threatening you are nine late my </v>

38
00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:01.810
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Israel.</v>

39
00:02:01.811 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 3>The one and only</v>

40
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.230
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

41
00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.160
<v Speaker 2>fact is that Benjamin Netanyahu or bibby</v>
<v Speaker 2>as is known in Israel,</v>

42
00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.810
<v Speaker 2>done practically everything in his </v>
<v Speaker 2>country during his time as a soldier.</v>

43
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.703
<v Speaker 2>And remember here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the military service is mandatory in </v>

44
00:02:25.211 --> 00:02:27.850
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He commanded a special forces unit,</v>

45
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.220
<v Speaker 2>antibiotic [inaudible] and plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 2>operations which have names liquid you'd</v>

46
00:02:31.221 --> 00:02:32.054
<v Speaker 2>see in a Hollywood movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>names like operation in Ferno hands </v>

47
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.490
<v Speaker 2>operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a tape where by the way,</v>

48
00:02:36.491 --> 00:02:37.324
<v Speaker 2>ness and Yahoo was shot while his unit </v>
<v Speaker 2>rescue to plane hijacked by the </v>

49
00:02:40.211 --> 00:02:43.060
<v Speaker 2>terrorist group,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Black September organization.</v>

50
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.040
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm 28 years old.</v>

51
00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.220
<v Speaker 1>I've had to defend my country in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>wars and in many battles</v>

52
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.373
<v Speaker 2>as a soldier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He also participated in operations in </v>

53
00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:53.190
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria and Jordan.</v>

54
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 2>That's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After finishing his military service,</v>

55
00:02:57.961 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 2>this prime minister went to the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States to study as well.</v>

56
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:02.500
<v Speaker 2>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well where did he study?</v>

57
00:03:02.501 --> 00:03:07.420
<v Speaker 2>Well first it was mit and then it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>Harvard and by the way,</v>

58
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:08.254
<v Speaker 2>here's some curious trivia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 1973 when the Yom Kippur war broke </v>

59
00:03:11.291 --> 00:03:13.330
<v Speaker 2>out between Israel and its Arab </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighbors,</v>

60
00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:14.223
<v Speaker 2>Netanyahu who was studying in Boston </v>
<v Speaker 2>returned home to rejoin the special </v>

61
00:03:17.711 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 2>forces until the war ended.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But moving on from Trivia,</v>

62
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.573
<v Speaker 2>that's continued.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that after studying in the </v>

63
00:03:24.491 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 2>United States and spending some time </v>
<v Speaker 2>working in consulting,</v>

64
00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.820
<v Speaker 2>he got involved in politics where again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's done everything.</v>

65
00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.050
<v Speaker 2>He has been a member of parliaments and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ambassador to the UN Minister of foreign</v>

66
00:03:35.051 --> 00:03:36.670
<v Speaker 2>affairs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minister of finance,</v>

67
00:03:36.671 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 2>and of course prime minister for four </v>
<v Speaker 2>towns.</v>

68
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.360
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>

69
00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:41.223
<v Speaker 2>he's about to become the Israeli prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>minister with the longest time in </v>

70
00:03:44.861 --> 00:03:45.910
<v Speaker 2>office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

71
00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.330
<v Speaker 2>now his position of influence and power </v>
<v Speaker 2>is being questions.</v>

72
00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.140
<v Speaker 2>So let's take a look at what is </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening or why this man is an election</v>

73
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:54.730
<v Speaker 2>winning machine</v>

74
00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.573
<v Speaker 4>cornered</v>

75
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.110
<v Speaker 2>on February the 12th 2018 after a year </v>
<v Speaker 2>of investigations,</v>

76
00:04:09.111 --> 00:04:09.944
<v Speaker 2>the Israeli police recommended the </v>
<v Speaker 2>attorney general bring charges against </v>

77
00:04:12.921 --> 00:04:17.640
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Netanyahu.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the police state there are clear</v>

78
00:04:17.641 --> 00:04:19.830
<v Speaker 2>indications of corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bribes,</v>

79
00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:20.723
<v Speaker 2>and influence peddling.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They accused the prime minister of </v>

80
00:04:22.921 --> 00:04:23.754
<v Speaker 2>having received gifts of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars of having good </v>

81
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:27.414
<v Speaker 2>spires do influence the media and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>of having protected millionaire </v>

82
00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 2>corruption in the multimillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 2>process of buying German submarines.</v>

83
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:38.153
<v Speaker 2>And do you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the first time that Israel </v>

84
00:04:40.161 --> 00:04:41.260
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>police have accused him.</v>

85
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:42.123
<v Speaker 2>They also did it in 1997 and again in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1999 during that and Yahoo's first term </v>

86
00:04:46.271 --> 00:04:49.990
<v Speaker 2>as prime minister back then the </v>
<v Speaker 2>accusations ended with no charges.</v>

87
00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.883
<v Speaker 2>And now again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prime minister has made it very </v>

88
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:53.704
<v Speaker 2>clear that he will not yield nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll have sway and nothing will sway </v>

89
00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.074
<v Speaker 2>me.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not even the incessant attacks against </v>

90
00:05:00.881 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 2>me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Netanyahu.</v>

91
00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.170
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that whether or not he's </v>
<v Speaker 2>finally accused.</v>

92
00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.380
<v Speaker 2>Netanyahu is on the line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way it Israel,</v>

93
00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.273
<v Speaker 2>nobody is immune to justice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the last decades they have condemned </v>

94
00:05:11.681 --> 00:05:13.420
<v Speaker 2>and the prison's a former prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>minister,</v>

95
00:05:13.421 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 2>accurate almost has an ex presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Moshe Katsav.</v>

96
00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:20.580
<v Speaker 2>So if Fidessa Yard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was guilty and he's got a pain.</v>

97
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.410
<v Speaker 2>Therefore it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you were in this video,</v>

98
00:05:22.411 --> 00:05:24.670
<v Speaker 2>we're going to get to know Israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prime minister besser.</v>

99
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:25.504
<v Speaker 2>We're going to take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is good and his bad side and </v>

100
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.893
<v Speaker 2>investigates what made an and Yahoo is </v>
<v Speaker 2>such an important character in Israel's </v>

101
00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:36.050
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He beebe the savior.</v>

102
00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're,</v>

103
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.150
<v Speaker 2>we might not be the most popular guy on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planets,</v>

104
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.870
<v Speaker 2>but one thing is absolutely certain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every time bibby has come to power,</v>

105
00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 2>he's done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I was a very,</v>

106
00:05:52.221 --> 00:05:53.450
<v Speaker 2>very difficult conditions.</v>

107
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:55.670
<v Speaker 5>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 5>During</v>

108
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.503
<v Speaker 2>his first term when he came to power </v>
<v Speaker 2>1996 the country was greatly unbalanced </v>

109
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:03.680
<v Speaker 2>with an uncontrolled public and deficits</v>
<v Speaker 2>and growing external debt.</v>

110
00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:05.983
<v Speaker 2>In 2003 when he was appointed minister </v>
<v Speaker 2>of finance under aerial Sharon's </v>

111
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:09.674
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If the country was undergoing its worst </v>

112
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.314
<v Speaker 2>recession and the most current time was </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2009 just when his country was </v>

113
00:06:15.741 --> 00:06:19.520
<v Speaker 2>suffering the consequences of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>greater international financial crisis.</v>

114
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in all these cases,</v>

115
00:06:21.741 --> 00:06:24.740
<v Speaker 2>Netanyahu's recipes they works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>

116
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.603
<v Speaker 2>with his policies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pity has transformed this country's </v>

117
00:06:27.351 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 2>identity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks largely to his governance.</v>

118
00:06:29.811 --> 00:06:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Israel has gone from being a place with </v>
<v Speaker 2>chronic imbalances and crises.</v>

119
00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.040
<v Speaker 2>A country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's,</v>

120
00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.873
<v Speaker 2>in 1984 had to be rescued by the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States to becoming a prosperous country </v>

121
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:39.613
<v Speaker 2>with well organized accounts and say </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide power in technology and </v>

122
00:06:42.801 --> 00:06:47.801
<v Speaker 2>innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Through all this,</v>

123
00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:50.703
<v Speaker 2>we can understand how despite all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>controversy maybe continues to raise </v>

124
00:06:53.621 --> 00:06:55.210
<v Speaker 2>passions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some against him,</v>

125
00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:59.590
<v Speaker 2>but many in favor of him,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but many of you might not be thinking,</v>

126
00:06:59.591 --> 00:07:00.610
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what,</v>

127
00:07:00.611 --> 00:07:01.750
<v Speaker 2>where?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or rather,</v>

128
00:07:01.751 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 2>what are Benjamin Netanyahu's recipes?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that's exactly what we're going to</v>

129
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:06.844
<v Speaker 2>look at next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Traditionally Israel was a socialist </v>

130
00:07:11.851 --> 00:07:14.160
<v Speaker 2>country with high taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of regulation,</v>

131
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:15.960
<v Speaker 2>and a very large governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

132
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:16.823
<v Speaker 2>they're these mission was to change this</v>
<v Speaker 2>model once and for all and in force </v>

133
00:07:19.081 --> 00:07:19.914
<v Speaker 2>another that would organize the accounts</v>
<v Speaker 2>and improve the country's competitive </v>

134
00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:23.940
<v Speaker 2>dust.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

135
00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 2>check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You think that</v>

136
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:30.770
<v Speaker 6>mathematicians and computer engineers or</v>
<v Speaker 6>mechanical engineers or doctors or first</v>

137
00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.840
<v Speaker 6>they're very important,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but they're not first,</v>

138
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:33.793
<v Speaker 6>they're second.</v>
<v Speaker 6>There was a country that had the best </v>

139
00:07:35.211 --> 00:07:37.430
<v Speaker 6>mathematicians,</v>
<v Speaker 6>the best physicists,</v>

140
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.820
<v Speaker 6>the best metallurgists in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but that country was very poor.</v>

141
00:07:40.821 --> 00:07:44.750
<v Speaker 6>It was called the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 6>What comes first is markets.</v>

142
00:07:44.930 --> 00:07:45.763
<v Speaker 6>This was the main thing that I tried to </v>
<v Speaker 6>bring to the Israeli economy in my own </v>

143
00:07:48.711 --> 00:07:50.180
<v Speaker 6>way.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Benjamin Netanyahu</v>

144
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:51.213
<v Speaker 2>with this idea in mind and its first </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandate in 1996 is number one priority </v>

145
00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:55.833
<v Speaker 2>was to reduce the public deficits.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Privatized banks and large government </v>

146
00:07:58.601 --> 00:08:01.450
<v Speaker 2>owned companies and suppress capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls.</v>

147
00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:02.530
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at that time,</v>

148
00:08:02.531 --> 00:08:03.364
<v Speaker 2>Israelis had a restriction on the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they could take out of the country </v>

149
00:08:05.650 --> 00:08:08.110
<v Speaker 2>and to use for buying foreign currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

150
00:08:08.111 --> 00:08:08.944
<v Speaker 2>we could say that the Israel of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties resembled the coaching is </v>

151
00:08:11.411 --> 00:08:12.244
<v Speaker 2>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of public spending and capital </v>

152
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 2>controls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's continue.</v>

153
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.343
<v Speaker 2>In 2003 when the country was undergoing </v>
<v Speaker 2>a terrible crisis as minister of </v>

154
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:26.230
<v Speaker 2>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Minister of Finance with a lot of power.</v>

155
00:08:26.231 --> 00:08:27.064
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netanyahu froze public spending and </v>

156
00:08:28.991 --> 00:08:31.570
<v Speaker 2>launched a huge tax reduction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

157
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:36.160
<v Speaker 2>he reduced corporate income tax as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as individual income tax by half.</v>

158
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when he arrived at the ministry,</v>

159
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:45.160
<v Speaker 2>the maximum rate on income in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 2>wages was 64% when he left,</v>

160
00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:46.083
<v Speaker 2>it was 44% a 20 point reduction in just </v>
<v Speaker 2>two years and when he came to power in </v>

161
00:08:50.531 --> 00:08:53.500
<v Speaker 2>2009 he had a similar recipe that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>public spending,</v>

162
00:08:53.501 --> 00:08:58.501
<v Speaker 2>fewer taxes and less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

163
00:09:00.511 --> 00:09:01.344
<v Speaker 2>in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he managed to get Israel once and for </v>

164
00:09:02.761 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 2>all to exploit its huge natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 2>reserves.</v>

165
00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:11.110
<v Speaker 6>Israel bolsters Egypt ties with $15 </v>
<v Speaker 6>billion gas deal.</v>

166
00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:14.950
<v Speaker 2>It was precisely because of this that </v>
<v Speaker 2>many believe Israel is miracle would not</v>

167
00:09:14.951 --> 00:09:17.170
<v Speaker 2>have been possible without this prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>minister,</v>

168
00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:20.620
<v Speaker 2>but don't think that he has only had </v>
<v Speaker 2>good results in the economic sector,</v>

169
00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:21.493
<v Speaker 2>not at all</v>

170
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:22.903
<v Speaker 6>in the 37 months that Netanyahu held </v>
<v Speaker 6>office Israeli citizens enjoyed or one </v>

171
00:09:27.801 --> 00:09:31.910
<v Speaker 6>of the safest and quietest periods with </v>
<v Speaker 6>regards to terrorism.</v>

172
00:09:32.030 --> 00:09:35.450
<v Speaker 6>Of the five is really leaders examined </v>
<v Speaker 6>Robin Perez,</v>

173
00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:37.160
<v Speaker 6>Netanyahu,</v>
<v Speaker 6>Brock Sharone,</v>

174
00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.113
<v Speaker 6>Netanyahu's policies with regards to the</v>
<v Speaker 6>prevention and deterrence of terrorism </v>

175
00:09:41.931 --> 00:09:43.010
<v Speaker 6>where the most effective</v>

176
00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:47.380
<v Speaker 2>indeed in addition to the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israeli society recognizes net and Yahoo</v>

177
00:09:47.410 --> 00:09:48.243
<v Speaker 2>has having made Israel a safer country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I save the country and also very </v>

178
00:09:52.061 --> 00:09:55.030
<v Speaker 2>importantly the country that is much </v>
<v Speaker 2>more open to the world.</v>

179
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:57.370
<v Speaker 2>So much so that this prime minister has </v>
<v Speaker 2>succeeded.</v>

180
00:09:57.430 --> 00:10:00.760
<v Speaker 2>And this is not here because I think </v>
<v Speaker 2>this will amaze you in getting relations</v>

181
00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:04.990
<v Speaker 2>between Israel and the Arab countries to</v>
<v Speaker 2>go smoothly.</v>

182
00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:08.200
<v Speaker 2>And this is something that we certainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to dive more into man.</v>

183
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:09.160
<v Speaker 2>What do that right now,</v>

184
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:17.800
<v Speaker 6>external approach.</v>

185
00:10:20.490 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 2>So you probably know the popular saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>my enemy's enemy is my friend.</v>

186
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:25.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it looks as if something like this is </v>

187
00:10:25.711 --> 00:10:26.544
<v Speaker 2>happening in the Middle East with Iran </v>
<v Speaker 2>and to with fundamentalist groups like </v>

188
00:10:30.390 --> 00:10:31.223
<v Speaker 2>Isis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean check all the news that the New </v>

189
00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:35.460
<v Speaker 2>York Times published on February the </v>
<v Speaker 2>third 2018</v>

190
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.050
<v Speaker 6>secret alliance is real carries out air </v>
<v Speaker 6>strikes in Egypt with Kairos.</v>

191
00:10:41.051 --> 00:10:43.510
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Pay Close attention to this new spot.</v>

192
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.373
<v Speaker 2>In the last two years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel has carried out more than a </v>

193
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.840
<v Speaker 2>hundred area.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tax with planes,</v>

194
00:10:49.870 --> 00:10:53.010
<v Speaker 2>helicopters and drones against </v>
<v Speaker 2>fundamentalist groups in Egypt's,</v>

195
00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:53.853
<v Speaker 2>particularly against the so called </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic state of Sinai that is an Arab </v>

196
00:10:56.861 --> 00:10:57.850
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

197
00:10:57.851 --> 00:10:58.684
<v Speaker 2>the Egyptian government has authorized </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel to carry out attacks and </v>

198
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:04.300
<v Speaker 2>operations within its territory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is really quite amazing,</v>

199
00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:07.230
<v Speaker 2>but that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel's relations with Jordan and Egypt</v>

200
00:11:07.231 --> 00:11:08.064
<v Speaker 2>are better than ever,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they're also growing stronger with </v>

201
00:11:09.851 --> 00:11:12.310
<v Speaker 2>other Arab countries including Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

202
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:13.600
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard that rise.</v>

203
00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:17.020
<v Speaker 2>Now they still aren't formal but they </v>
<v Speaker 2>are happening behind closed doors.</v>

204
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.733
<v Speaker 6>There is an alignment of Israel and </v>
<v Speaker 6>other countries in the Middle East that </v>

205
00:11:21.381 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 6>would have been on imaginable 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 6>ago.</v>

206
00:11:24.260 --> 00:11:27.200
<v Speaker 6>Certainly in my lifetime I never saw </v>
<v Speaker 6>anything like it.</v>

207
00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:30.020
<v Speaker 6>And I met the age of the state of Israel</v>
<v Speaker 6>have more or less.</v>

208
00:11:30.021 --> 00:11:31.730
<v Speaker 6>So it's an extraordinary thing.</v>

209
00:11:31.930 --> 00:11:32.763
<v Speaker 2>So how about another example?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well after 70 years of prohibition and </v>

210
00:11:34.871 --> 00:11:35.704
<v Speaker 2>for the first time Saudi Arabia has </v>
<v Speaker 2>authorized in Israeli commercial flight </v>

211
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:39.753
<v Speaker 2>to cross it's ass space since March Air </v>
<v Speaker 2>India flights between New Delhi and Tel </v>

212
00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.220
<v Speaker 2>Aviv.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well cross Saudi ass space.</v>

213
00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:48.940
<v Speaker 2>This might seem like a small step but </v>
<v Speaker 2>it's written not and you know what?</v>

214
00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:52.930
<v Speaker 2>It's not just the Arab countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The prime minister has set his sights on</v>

215
00:11:52.931 --> 00:11:56.590
<v Speaker 2>the and there's also establish </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprisingly good relations with India,</v>

216
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:59.080
<v Speaker 2>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Singapore and even China.</v>

217
00:11:59.190 --> 00:12:04.190
<v Speaker 3>We are very much very much excited by </v>
<v Speaker 3>the belt and road initiative and what we</v>

218
00:12:05.581 --> 00:12:06.414
<v Speaker 3>feel is merely an express lane.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This belt and road that is called the </v>

219
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:13.590
<v Speaker 3>China is going to relations</v>

220
00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.650
<v Speaker 2>and once more that's in Yahoo led the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first visit of an Israeli prime minister</v>

221
00:12:17.651 --> 00:12:20.860
<v Speaker 2>to Latin America in 2017 he visited </v>
<v Speaker 2>Mexico.</v>

222
00:12:20.861 --> 00:12:25.861
<v Speaker 2>Columbia and sergeants has an Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

223
00:12:26.771 --> 00:12:27.604
<v Speaker 2>Smart.</v>

224
00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.090
<v Speaker 3>Israel is coming back to Africa and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Africa is coming back to Israel.</v>

225
00:12:40.730 --> 00:12:41.563
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

226
00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:44.003
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's in Yahoo was the first Israeli </v>

227
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:45.923
<v Speaker 2>needed to visit this consonant since the</v>
<v Speaker 2>1960s and many African leaders aren't </v>

228
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:51.570
<v Speaker 2>delighted with Israel's money and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel's technology.</v>

229
00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:52.453
<v Speaker 1>Jake,</v>

230
00:12:53.390 --> 00:12:57.620
<v Speaker 2>diversity and richness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I saw passion and productivity.</v>

231
00:12:57.710 --> 00:13:00.710
<v Speaker 2>I saw a young African entrepreneurs who </v>
<v Speaker 2>are building companies,</v>

232
00:13:00.740 --> 00:13:04.700
<v Speaker 2>harnessing the power of the digital age.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africans are seizing the future.</v>

233
00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.640
<v Speaker 2>Israel wants to seize this future with </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

234
00:13:07.850 --> 00:13:08.683
<v Speaker 2>In short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can see you both in the economic </v>

235
00:13:10.071 --> 00:13:12.320
<v Speaker 2>field as well as insecurity and foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy.</v>

236
00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:14.930
<v Speaker 2>There's prime minister as many reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>to be proud,</v>

237
00:13:14.960 --> 00:13:18.470
<v Speaker 2>but of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is a bed of roses here.</v>

238
00:13:24.640 --> 00:13:25.460
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

239
00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.293
<v Speaker 2>Dark side.</v>

240
00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:29.260
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

241
00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:31.180
<v Speaker 2>We just announced it before on visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic.</v>

242
00:13:31.181 --> 00:13:32.014
<v Speaker 2>One of the greatest problems we see with</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benjamin Netanyahu in addition to his </v>

243
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:35.344
<v Speaker 2>corruption suspicions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is his position towards the West Bank </v>

244
00:13:37.691 --> 00:13:38.620
<v Speaker 2>settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

245
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.510
<v Speaker 2>And that's in Yahoo supports these </v>
<v Speaker 2>settlements,</v>

246
00:13:40.511 --> 00:13:43.240
<v Speaker 2>continual growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as we saw in recent years,</v>

247
00:13:43.241 --> 00:13:46.510
<v Speaker 2>this government has promoted to policy </v>
<v Speaker 2>to expand and consolidate them,</v>

248
00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:51.700
<v Speaker 2>and it's more than three years in power.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This government has been irrational,</v>

249
00:13:51.790 --> 00:13:56.050
<v Speaker 2>bordering on the messianic does now </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasingly clear where it is headed.</v>

250
00:13:56.110 --> 00:13:56.943
<v Speaker 2>Creeping annexation of the West Bank </v>
<v Speaker 2>aimed at precluding any permanent </v>

251
00:14:00.581 --> 00:14:04.870
<v Speaker 2>separation from the Palestinians who </v>
<v Speaker 2>barack former prime minister of Israel.</v>

252
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:05.793
<v Speaker 2>And besides these settlements,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Netanyahu's power relations with some </v>

253
00:14:08.141 --> 00:14:11.500
<v Speaker 2>magnates a raw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so Ashley put it questionable.</v>

254
00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:14.273
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his friends and gambling mogul Sheldon </v>

255
00:14:16.350 --> 00:14:17.183
<v Speaker 2>Adelson invested $200 million into </v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel high on a free newspaper that </v>

256
00:14:20.401 --> 00:14:21.840
<v Speaker 2>greatly favors net in the yard.</v>

257
00:14:21.960 --> 00:14:22.793
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

258
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:24.613
<v Speaker 2>a question that arises is what you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>to return the favor and other </v>

259
00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:30.860
<v Speaker 2>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Parts of Netanyahu's dark side has to do</v>

260
00:14:30.980 --> 00:14:31.813
<v Speaker 2>with his way of doing politics is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tough opponent who has no qualms about </v>

261
00:14:36.501 --> 00:14:39.230
<v Speaker 2>attacking his rivals through all </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible means.</v>

262
00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:42.470
<v Speaker 2>That is precisely what he did in 1995 </v>
<v Speaker 2>with prime minister.</v>

263
00:14:42.471 --> 00:14:43.304
<v Speaker 2>It's soccer robyn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who he accused among many other things </v>

264
00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.350
<v Speaker 2>of portraying Jewish values,</v>
<v Speaker 2>potentially need generated,</v>

265
00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.213
<v Speaker 2>were so great that many detractors blame</v>
<v Speaker 2>him for the hatred that ended with </v>

266
00:14:52.611 --> 00:14:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Robin's murder at the hands of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremist.</v>

267
00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:57.620
<v Speaker 2>His critics say that Netanyahu didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>pull the trigger,</v>

268
00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:00.920
<v Speaker 2>but that is a lack of political piety </v>
<v Speaker 2>that to the tragedy.</v>

269
00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.420
<v Speaker 2>So that Divya is the end of this video </v>
<v Speaker 2>about a politician who has a dark side,</v>

270
00:15:07.421 --> 00:15:08.254
<v Speaker 2>but also a very bright one as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has contributed to making Israel a </v>

271

<v Speaker 2>much more prosperous country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now it's your turn.</v>
