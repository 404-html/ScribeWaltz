1
00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:15.513
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:21.463
<v Speaker 2>April,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2015 a historic meeting took place </v>

3
00:00:23.601 --> 00:00:26.090
<v Speaker 2>between Raul Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of Cuba,</v>

4
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.260
<v Speaker 2>and Barack Obama.</v>

5
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.710
<v Speaker 2>It was celebrated in Panama and it was </v>
<v Speaker 2>the first and bilateral meeting of the U</v>

6
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.620
<v Speaker 2>S and Cuban and presidents in 50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>four months,</v>

7
00:00:37.621 --> 00:00:38.454
<v Speaker 2>Ellia booth leaders and announced they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would remake relations between the two </v>

8
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.360
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.433
<v Speaker 2>the United States of America is changing</v>
<v Speaker 2>its relationship with the people of </v>

10
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:47.030
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm dust.</v>

11
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.130
<v Speaker 2>They said they would do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it was done in just a short period of</v>

12
00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 2>time that he first changes were made and</v>
<v Speaker 2>relations between both countries started</v>

13
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:54.894
<v Speaker 2>to returns and normal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now he goes same like we see this a lot </v>

14
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:58.374
<v Speaker 2>on this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the arrival of Donald Trump to the </v>

15
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.590
<v Speaker 2>White House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

16
00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.860
<v Speaker 2>they changed everything again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new presidents of the United States,</v>

17
00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:06.694
<v Speaker 2>there's ordered that the u s steps back </v>
<v Speaker 2>from most of the changes that Obama </v>

18
00:01:09.781 --> 00:01:13.050
<v Speaker 2>initiated with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question might be,</v>

19
00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.943
<v Speaker 2>why is he doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does he expect and what are the </v>

20
00:01:16.621 --> 00:01:17.454
<v Speaker 2>consequences of this new policy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to look at all of these </v>

21
00:01:19.981 --> 00:01:21.870
<v Speaker 2>questions in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>

22
00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:22.733
<v Speaker 2>let's have a quick little caps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The history of the relations between </v>

23
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.010
<v Speaker 2>these two countries.</v>

24
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.010
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:30.850
<v Speaker 3>The embargo,</v>

26
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.600
<v Speaker 1>often</v>

27
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.470
<v Speaker 2>the so called Cuban revolution took </v>
<v Speaker 2>place against a Batista's dictatorship.</v>

28
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.333
<v Speaker 2>The new governments in the islands led </v>
<v Speaker 2>by Fidel Castro soon started to </v>

29
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:44.030
<v Speaker 2>nationalize every kind of capital good </v>
<v Speaker 2>and company Landon's,</v>

30
00:01:44.031 --> 00:01:45.230
<v Speaker 2>hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>factories.</v>

31
00:01:45.231 --> 00:01:46.064
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything was up for grabs by the </v>

32
00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:51.410
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Cuban revolution ended on the 1st</v>

33
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.000
<v Speaker 2>of January,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1959 and already buying may,</v>

34
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.230
<v Speaker 2>the government had begun a huge </v>
<v Speaker 2>expropriations all across the country.</v>

35
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:58.123
<v Speaker 2>Now our eyes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might probably be able to imagine </v>

36
00:01:59.571 --> 00:02:03.350
<v Speaker 2>this is something that the u s did not </v>
<v Speaker 2>really take very well.</v>

37
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.303
<v Speaker 2>There were thousands of lawsuits filed </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the u s which had close relations </v>

38
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:09.340
<v Speaker 2>with Cuba at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>

39
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.213
<v Speaker 2>if this wasn't enough to upset the u s </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Soviet Union was already getting on </v>

40
00:02:13.941 --> 00:02:15.670
<v Speaker 2>well with Fidel Castro</v>

41
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.710
<v Speaker 3>at this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 3>when as a penalty,</v>

42
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.603
<v Speaker 3>Washington passed the first trade </v>
<v Speaker 3>embargo against the island and in </v>

43
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:24.243
<v Speaker 3>embargo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That's slowly grew stronger as the </v>

44
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 3>relations between these countries were </v>
<v Speaker 3>getting worse.</v>

45
00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

46
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.380
<v Speaker 2>Backed off to the missile crisis of 1962</v>
<v Speaker 2>at Kennedy,</v>

47
00:02:33.381 --> 00:02:36.110
<v Speaker 2>even limited to us,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traveled to Cuba since then.</v>

48
00:02:36.111 --> 00:02:36.944
<v Speaker 2>Then with the exception of short periods</v>
<v Speaker 2>of battery relations under the </v>

49
00:02:39.111 --> 00:02:39.944
<v Speaker 2>governments of Ford and Carter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the various governments of the United </v>

50
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.700
<v Speaker 2>States of cabs of the embargo and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>policy of isolating Cuba economically,</v>

51
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>we'll move Reagan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reagan</v>

52
00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:51.093
<v Speaker 2>labeled the island as a sponsor of </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorism and later Bill Clinton made </v>

53
00:02:54.341 --> 00:02:57.850
<v Speaker 2>even more severe restrictions and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>embargo was put into law.</v>

54
00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.743
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>traveling to and investing in Cuba or </v>

55
00:03:00.521 --> 00:03:04.440
<v Speaker 2>doing business with the Cuban government</v>
<v Speaker 2>has been very limited for America.</v>

56
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:07.710
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

57
00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:10.770
<v Speaker 2>That is until Barack Obama came to </v>
<v Speaker 2>office</v>

58
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.010
<v Speaker 3>story 2008 fidel past power to his </v>
<v Speaker 3>brother Raul Castro.</v>

59
00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:19.023
<v Speaker 3>That same year elections took place and </v>
<v Speaker 3>Obama said it was time to use a </v>

60
00:03:22.151 --> 00:03:22.984
<v Speaker 3>different approach with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was time to improve diplomatic </v>

61
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:27.160
<v Speaker 3>relations between the two countries.</v>

62
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.670
<v Speaker 2>Obama didn't want to wait and shortly </v>
<v Speaker 2>after he arrived in the White House,</v>

63
00:03:32.671 --> 00:03:35.700
<v Speaker 2>he softens some of the restrictions that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were in place on Cuba.</v>

64
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:38.250
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he allowed Cubans in the u s to send the</v>

65
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:42.330
<v Speaker 2>money to the islands and he started to </v>
<v Speaker 2>allow US citizens do travel to Cuba.</v>

66
00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.610
<v Speaker 2>Many more things followed these fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>gestures.</v>

67
00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.473
<v Speaker 2>During the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama was in office many restrictions </v>

68
00:03:47.281 --> 00:03:48.120
<v Speaker 2>against Cuba.</v>

69
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.463
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

70
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.830
<v Speaker 2>December of that year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raul Castro and Obama met in Panama.</v>

71
00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:58.840
<v Speaker 2>Significant progress was being made.</v>

72
00:03:58.920 --> 00:03:59.753
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I think what we have both concluded is </v>

73
00:04:01.771 --> 00:04:04.020
<v Speaker 4>that we can disagree,</v>
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>

74
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:09.170
<v Speaker 4>with a spirit of respect and civility </v>
<v Speaker 4>and that over time it is possible for us</v>

75
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.610
<v Speaker 4>to turn the page and develop a new </v>
<v Speaker 4>relationship between our two countries.</v>

76
00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.883
<v Speaker 2>Anne's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is how to greater moments took </v>

77
00:04:20.511 --> 00:04:21.344
<v Speaker 2>place in 2015 the embassy's reopens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>both countries and in March of 2016 Air </v>

78
00:04:26.421 --> 00:04:28.880
<v Speaker 2>Force One lands then Havana for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>first time in history,</v>

79
00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:38.730
<v Speaker 5>Cuba,</v>

80
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.563
<v Speaker 2>I dunno,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hosted a sitting American presidents </v>

81
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.270
<v Speaker 2>since 1920 [inaudible].</v>

82
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:43.403
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

83
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.603
<v Speaker 4>See of isolation designed for the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 4>War made little sense in the 21st </v>

84
00:04:48.471 --> 00:04:49.304
<v Speaker 4>century.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The embargo was only hurting the Cuban </v>

85
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:52.110
<v Speaker 4>people.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Instead of helping them,</v>

86
00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:53.563
<v Speaker 4>it's time to lift the embargo.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is time now for us to leave the past </v>

87
00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.560
<v Speaker 4>behind.</v>
<v Speaker 4>It is time for us to look forward to the</v>

88
00:05:00.561 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 4>future together.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When for Turo,</v>

89
00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:03.923
<v Speaker 4>they Esperanza</v>

90
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:05.643
<v Speaker 2>policies towards Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're taking over and even though the </v>

91
00:05:08.081 --> 00:05:10.660
<v Speaker 2>embargo laws were technically still </v>
<v Speaker 2>enforced,</v>

92
00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:11.523
<v Speaker 2>the Obama administration managed to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>legal loopholes to allow the relations </v>

93
00:05:14.771 --> 00:05:17.800
<v Speaker 2>between these two countries to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>something close to normal.</v>

94
00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:18.663
<v Speaker 2>When Obama left the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Americans could travel freely to Cuban </v>

95
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:21.813
<v Speaker 2>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could send unlimited money back to the </v>

96
00:05:23.321 --> 00:05:24.154
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>American companies could invest in Cuba </v>

97
00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.853
<v Speaker 2>and even planes of American companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>frequently landed at Jose Marti </v>

98
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 2>international airports because the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>relationship,</v>

99
00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.250
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was working,</v>

100
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>but then Donald Trump became president </v>
<v Speaker 2>all over the United States.</v>

101
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:40.270
<v Speaker 2>And as we already mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything changed</v>

102
00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.580
<v Speaker 1>grump and Cuba.</v>

103
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.703
<v Speaker 2>On the 16th of June,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 trump decided to take this new </v>

104
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.603
<v Speaker 2>policy back and he did so in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood of Miami called Little </v>

105
00:05:58.220 --> 00:05:59.053
<v Speaker 2>Havana effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Immediately I am canceling the last </v>

106
00:06:01.101 --> 00:06:04.340
<v Speaker 2>administration's completely one sided </v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with Cuba.</v>

107
00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:05.273
<v Speaker 2>As soon as he finished his speech,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump signed guidelines for his so </v>

108
00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.534
<v Speaker 2>called new policy with Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's after any 50 year embargo with </v>

109
00:06:11.271 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 2>the country etiquette hardly be </v>
<v Speaker 2>described as actually being new,</v>

110
00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 3>won't completely reverse Obama's </v>
<v Speaker 3>policies.</v>

111
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:21.890
<v Speaker 3>Many will be maintained,</v>
<v Speaker 3>for example,</v>

112
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.783
<v Speaker 3>the opening of embassies and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>commercial flights between the two </v>

113
00:06:25.161 --> 00:06:25.994
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

114
00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>from now on trips of Americans to Cuba,</v>

115
00:06:29.531 --> 00:06:30.460
<v Speaker 2>we'll,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll be limited does it,</v>

116
00:06:30.461 --> 00:06:31.294
<v Speaker 2>they won't be able to go individually </v>
<v Speaker 2>and any relationship with gay Sunday </v>

117
00:06:34.461 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>holding grahib directed by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>governments,</v>

118
00:06:36.351 --> 00:06:40.250
<v Speaker 2>which controls more than 50% of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban economy will be forbidden.</v>

119
00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:41.113
<v Speaker 2>But don't think that trump has always </v>
<v Speaker 2>had this hard line attitude towards </v>

120
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:45.500
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Quite the opposite.</v>

121
00:06:45.501 --> 00:06:48.800
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1998 he tried to build a hotel on the</v>

122
00:06:48.801 --> 00:06:49.634
<v Speaker 2>islands contradicting the embargo and </v>
<v Speaker 2>did the beginning of 2016 he supported </v>

123
00:06:53.121 --> 00:06:55.550
<v Speaker 2>Obama's new policies towards the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

124
00:06:55.610 --> 00:06:56.443
<v Speaker 2>But here revision policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that trump's out attitude </v>

125
00:06:57.740 --> 00:06:58.700
<v Speaker 2>towards Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

126
00:06:58.701 --> 00:07:02.060
<v Speaker 2>it can be a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let's have a look at exactly why</v>

127
00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 5>trump's mistake.</v>

128
00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:11.650
<v Speaker 2>Let's make one thing really clear right </v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

129
00:07:11.651 --> 00:07:14.830
<v Speaker 2>The embargo against Cuba has been eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>total failure.</v>

130
00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:15.803
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:17.143
<v Speaker 3>US embargo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is blocked all trade and </v>

132
00:07:19.331 --> 00:07:22.780
<v Speaker 3>investment with Cuba for the past 55 </v>
<v Speaker 3>years has not worked.</v>

133
00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:23.673
<v Speaker 3>It is failed to isolate.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Cuban government failed to regain </v>

134
00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:26.523
<v Speaker 3>any nationalized property and succeeded </v>
<v Speaker 3>in giving an excuse to the Castro </v>

135
00:07:29.471 --> 00:07:31.900
<v Speaker 3>government for its abuses and economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>mismanaged</v>

136
00:07:33.290 --> 00:07:36.740
<v Speaker 2>more than 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The embargo has been completely useless.</v>

137
00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:37.603
<v Speaker 2>It hasn't accomplished anything,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and on top of that to the Cuban </v>

138
00:07:39.801 --> 00:07:44.300
<v Speaker 2>government has used it as an excuse to </v>
<v Speaker 2>justify their poor economic situation.</v>

139
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.750
<v Speaker 2>Wait just a second here because this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>not the end of it.</v>

140
00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:48.703
<v Speaker 2>Not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Reversing Obama's policies is a mistake </v>

141
00:07:51.381 --> 00:07:53.510
<v Speaker 2>for several reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Importantly,</v>

142
00:07:53.511 --> 00:07:54.344
<v Speaker 2>improved relations with the u s of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Menton better security for the United </v>

143
00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:58.963
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Obama signed several important </v>

144
00:07:59.811 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 2>cooperation agreements and since 2015 </v>
<v Speaker 2>given authorities have given information</v>

145
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 2>on drug and human trafficking to the u s</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's,</v>

146
00:08:07.521 --> 00:08:08.354
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia and China have also set their </v>

147
00:08:10.071 --> 00:08:10.940
<v Speaker 2>eyes on the island.</v>

148
00:08:10.980 --> 00:08:11.813
<v Speaker 5>The game.</v>

149
00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:16.570
<v Speaker 3>Russia says it may reopen Soviet era,</v>
<v Speaker 3>military bases,</v>

150
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.523
<v Speaker 5>Cuba</v>

151
00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:19.883
<v Speaker 2>probably.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine what a belief in national </v>

152
00:08:20.731 --> 00:08:23.610
<v Speaker 2>security of the United States this would</v>
<v Speaker 2>be.</v>

153
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.473
<v Speaker 2>This is why making relations more </v>
<v Speaker 2>difficult means nothing more than </v>

154
00:08:27.751 --> 00:08:32.310
<v Speaker 2>forcing the Cuban government to seek </v>
<v Speaker 2>better relations with Moscow or Beijing.</v>

155
00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 2>Not exactly a brilliant option for the u</v>
<v Speaker 2>s and there is so much more.</v>

156
00:08:37.830 --> 00:08:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Trump's new policy will only damage to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the interests of many American companies</v>

157
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:43.373
<v Speaker 2>as well as put at risk,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the major changes that are taking place </v>

158
00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:47.130
<v Speaker 2>on the islands.</v>

159
00:08:49.500 --> 00:08:51.020
<v Speaker 3>How is Cuba changing</v>

160
00:08:52.230 --> 00:08:53.700
<v Speaker 2>fins?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Raul Castro came to power.</v>

161
00:08:53.701 --> 00:08:54.534
<v Speaker 2>He has admitted that Cuban a change of </v>
<v Speaker 2>direction and that the Cuban model </v>

162
00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.390
<v Speaker 2>simply is not working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some people were saying that he wants to</v>

163
00:09:00.391 --> 00:09:01.224
<v Speaker 2>emulate China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be open to the world that maintain </v>

164
00:09:03.421 --> 00:09:04.254
<v Speaker 2>control.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that up until now changes </v>

165
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.390
<v Speaker 2>have been scarce and slow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but even so,</v>

166
00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:10.253
<v Speaker 2>these changes could be felt and now the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela can no longer help the </v>

167
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:13.974
<v Speaker 2>islands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These changes have become more and more </v>

168
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.063
<v Speaker 2>urgent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now let's have a look at what's been </v>

169
00:09:18.301 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 2>happening since 2011 when reforms took </v>
<v Speaker 2>place.</v>

170
00:09:21.421 --> 00:09:22.254
<v Speaker 2>Sims freelance entrepreneurship was made</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot easier since 2011 the number of </v>

171
00:09:27.601 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 2>self employed workers in Cuba is four </v>
<v Speaker 2>times larger.</v>

172
00:09:30.631 --> 00:09:31.464
<v Speaker 2>It's Dave.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The number exceeds half a million </v>

173
00:09:32.551 --> 00:09:33.384
<v Speaker 2>workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government has also allowed private </v>

174
00:09:34.531 --> 00:09:37.830
<v Speaker 2>farming for small farmers and </v>
<v Speaker 2>restaurants and small tourism businesses</v>

175
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.140
<v Speaker 2>growing and spreading across the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

176
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 2>The bottom is openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

177
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.350
<v Speaker 2>it certainly helps this process.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

178
00:09:46.351 --> 00:09:47.184
<v Speaker 2>almost all private businesses in Cuba </v>
<v Speaker 2>are working off money coming in from </v>

179
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:50.964
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Abby and b already has 22,000 </v>

180
00:09:52.791 --> 00:09:55.680
<v Speaker 2>apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homes or rooms available in Cuba.</v>

181
00:09:55.710 --> 00:09:56.543
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we shouldn't forget about less tangible </v>

182
00:09:58.171 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 2>things like the exchange of ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mutual knowledge,</v>

183
00:10:01.051 --> 00:10:03.600
<v Speaker 2>and the strengthening of the private </v>
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>

184
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:07.590
<v Speaker 3>Every dollar left in the hands of cab </v>
<v Speaker 3>drivers,</v>

185
00:10:07.591 --> 00:10:10.020
<v Speaker 3>hotel workers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>waitresses and valleys.</v>

186
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.290
<v Speaker 3>It's a show of what awaits Cubans if </v>
<v Speaker 3>they reject socialism,</v>

187
00:10:13.470 --> 00:10:15.060
<v Speaker 3>US Senator Rand Paul,</v>

188
00:10:15.470 --> 00:10:19.460
<v Speaker 2>take a look at China and compare the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country as it is today to the country.</v>

189
00:10:19.461 --> 00:10:23.330
<v Speaker 2>It was during Mao's time since the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country opened itself up to the wells.</v>

190
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:26.750
<v Speaker 2>Hundreds of millions of people have left</v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty behinds.</v>

191
00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:28.220
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China like Cuba,</v>

192
00:10:28.221 --> 00:10:29.054
<v Speaker 2>it's still a terrible dictatorship is </v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to that open policy the Chinese </v>

193
00:10:32.661 --> 00:10:36.980
<v Speaker 2>have today more freedom as a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>standard of living than they've ever had</v>

194
00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:37.873
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The short of the matter is that the </v>

195
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:44.234
<v Speaker 2>embargo policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while it's fails and trump's insistence </v>

196
00:10:47.181 --> 00:10:48.014
<v Speaker 2>in going back to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is North's going to achieve anything </v>

197
00:10:49.761 --> 00:10:53.870
<v Speaker 2>that the weakening of security in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States lead to further poverty in</v>

198
00:10:53.871 --> 00:10:57.080
<v Speaker 2>Cuba and prevent the changes that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening on the islands.</v>

199
00:10:57.110 --> 00:11:00.140
<v Speaker 2>In February of 2018 at Castro was going </v>
<v Speaker 2>to leave power,</v>

200
00:11:00.170 --> 00:11:03.370
<v Speaker 2>and this is not the moment for the u s </v>
<v Speaker 2>to take a step</v>

201
00:11:03.460 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 5>that's in order to</v>

202
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:08.223
<v Speaker 2>define his decision.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And trump says he wants to defend human </v>

203
00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:11.620
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is nice.</v>

204
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:12.783
<v Speaker 2>Don't you think it's a bit hypocritical </v>
<v Speaker 2>to defend the Cuba's embargo while at </v>

205
00:11:15.341 --> 00:11:18.160
<v Speaker 2>the same time he hugs the leaders of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia?</v>

206
00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:20.110
<v Speaker 2>I mean a human rights not important,</v>

207
00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:24.200
<v Speaker 5>less important.</v>

208
00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:28.360
<v Speaker 2>10 Republicans have also criticized this</v>
<v Speaker 2>course changed with Cuba</v>

209
00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:33.000
<v Speaker 3>policy change that diminishes the </v>
<v Speaker 3>ability of Americans to travel freely to</v>

210
00:11:33.001 --> 00:11:38.001
<v Speaker 3>Cuba is not in the best interests of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>United States or the Cuban people.</v>

211
00:11:38.070 --> 00:11:39.900
<v Speaker 3>US Senator Jeff Flake.</v>

212
00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.510
<v Speaker 2>Now we'd really love to know what you </v>
