1
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Transylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like Castlevania with vampires.</v>

2
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.693
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that writes the lands where </v>

3
00:00:12.901 --> 00:00:13.734
<v Speaker 1>Dracula was born is also the place of </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most significant separatists </v>

4
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.500
<v Speaker 1>conflicts in all of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

5
00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:20.520
<v Speaker 1>Transylvania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

6
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:25.521
<v Speaker 1>it is the perfect place to make a visual</v>
<v Speaker 1>politic Halloween's special and yes,</v>

7
00:00:29.651 --> 00:00:30.011
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

8
00:00:30.011 --> 00:00:30.844
<v Speaker 1>We do read your comments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do know that you want to add about </v>

9
00:00:32.201 --> 00:00:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Castlevania and I tell you what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are working on it.</v>

10
00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:35.704
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's going to be complicated and it's </v>

11
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.670
<v Speaker 1>also going to be worth the waste,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I promise.</v>

12
00:00:39.671 --> 00:00:41.950
<v Speaker 1>Just sit tight for Catalonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>

13
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:42.843
<v Speaker 1>let us get back to Transylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a historical region located in </v>

14
00:00:46.031 --> 00:00:49.080
<v Speaker 1>the center of Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dislike being in Romania.</v>

15
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.300
<v Speaker 1>Twenty percent of its population doesn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>even speak Romanian.</v>

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.193
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their mother language needs to be </v>

17
00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.113
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian.</v>

18
00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:59.143
<v Speaker 1>In some areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of Hungarian speaking people </v>

19
00:01:01.031 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>rises to 80 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This area where the Hungarians are,</v>

20
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.540
<v Speaker 1>the majority is cooled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The CICA landscape almost every year you</v>

21
00:01:07.541 --> 00:01:08.374
<v Speaker 1>can see the massive protests of Zika,</v>
<v Speaker 1>least demanding more autonomy for the </v>

22
00:01:11.141 --> 00:01:11.974
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These demonstrations are celebrated in </v>

23
00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the main cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transylvania as well as Bucharest,</v>

24
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.240
<v Speaker 1>the Romanian capital and Budapest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hungarian capital,</v>

25
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.510
<v Speaker 1>but let's hold on for just a minute </v>
<v Speaker 1>because things are more complicated than</v>

26
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:25.690
<v Speaker 1>they seem in facsimiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't want to have their own country.</v>

27
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:26.673
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to become a special region </v>

28
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.870
<v Speaker 1>instinct of Romania with a very specific</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiscal system.</v>

29
00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.960
<v Speaker 1>So the question here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

30
00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.820
<v Speaker 1>why does this cause so many problems for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a while?</v>

31
00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:37.743
<v Speaker 1>All these demands creating such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant diplomatic conflicts as </v>

32
00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.280
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>

33
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:44.710
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does the Hungarian governments have</v>

34
00:01:44.711 --> 00:01:45.850
<v Speaker 1>to do with this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.230
<v Speaker 1>don't worry because today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

36
00:01:47.231 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 1>of course they're going to answer all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>

37
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:51.220
<v Speaker 1>but as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we do all of that,</v>

38
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.190
<v Speaker 1>let's go back and take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

39
00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Hairy tongue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like for centuries,</v>

40
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:03.400
<v Speaker 1>Transylvania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary.</v>

41
00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.383
<v Speaker 1>Back then it wasn't even a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The upper classes and aristocracy spoke </v>

42
00:02:07.901 --> 00:02:08.734
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian and Romanian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the language spoken by the </v>

43
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.983
<v Speaker 1>present.</v>

44
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.243
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

45
00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:15.580
<v Speaker 1>points in history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanian speakers.</v>

46
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.880
<v Speaker 1>What you've been prosecuted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities.</v>

47
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.020
<v Speaker 1>We call this process the mega ization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically these Hungarian rule,</v>

48
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to impose their culture at </v>
<v Speaker 1>any cost to is rs two grants.</v>

49
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Romanians were sort of hillbillies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you had a special love,</v>

50
00:02:28.921 --> 00:02:32.010
<v Speaker 1>the stealing things and a bad sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal hygiene.</v>

51
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.873
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was even a term to refer to these </v>

52
00:02:33.811 --> 00:02:34.644
<v Speaker 1>Romanians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were called at Zurich and yell </v>

53
00:02:35.991 --> 00:02:39.040
<v Speaker 1>view.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This literally means with a hairy</v>

54
00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 2>hum.</v>

55
00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.003
<v Speaker 1>So during the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government closed radian speaking </v>

56
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:47.914
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and they even forced a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens do change their Romanian name </v>

57
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.860
<v Speaker 1>to re Hungarian one just like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.753
<v Speaker 1>after World War One things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they really changed the Austrian </v>

59
00:02:56.611 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian empire and lost the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one the things that happens when you</v>

60
00:03:00.071 --> 00:03:03.070
<v Speaker 1>lose a war is you usually lose a part of</v>
<v Speaker 1>your territory.</v>

61
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.320
<v Speaker 1>One of those parts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that was Transylvania,</v>

62
00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:06.154
<v Speaker 1>which was incorporated into Romanian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly these peasants that were </v>

63
00:03:09.431 --> 00:03:13.740
<v Speaker 1>oppressed by the Hungarian ability that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have power and that power,</v>

64
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:14.613
<v Speaker 1>well they wanted revenge and this is how</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first attempts to destroy the </v>

65
00:03:18.221 --> 00:03:19.630
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:19.631 --> 00:03:24.631
<v Speaker 1>that's how they started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:03:26.671 --> 00:03:27.504
<v Speaker 1>it certainly wasn't an easy job.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not forget that despite being a part </v>

68
00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:31.944
<v Speaker 1>of Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Transylvania was the home of over 1 </v>

69
00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.380
<v Speaker 1>million Hungarian speaking people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

70
00:03:37.381 --> 00:03:38.214
<v Speaker 1>they were called the weeklies and for </v>
<v Speaker 1>generations they had been speaking the </v>

71
00:03:40.531 --> 00:03:41.364
<v Speaker 1>language of Istvan Orkney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things they got a whole lot uglier </v>

72
00:03:44.911 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>during world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungary,</v>

73
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:50.694
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they once again chose the wrong side to </v>

74
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.003
<v Speaker 1>ally with with Hitler Elb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They took it back to their former </v>

75
00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.680
<v Speaker 1>territories and struck back against </v>
<v Speaker 1>though you see wanted to erase Hungarian</v>

76
00:03:58.681 --> 00:04:01.140
<v Speaker 1>culture in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might imagine.</v>

77
00:04:01.141 --> 00:04:03.660
<v Speaker 1>This helps to make the Romanians even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more angry.</v>

78
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:06.000
<v Speaker 1>Then in 1945,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the Germans,</v>

79
00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:07.620
<v Speaker 1>they lost the war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That meant,</v>

80
00:04:07.621 --> 00:04:08.454
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the allies also lost and that </v>

81
00:04:09.451 --> 00:04:10.284
<v Speaker 1>included the Hungarians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Romania with a brand new communist </v>

82
00:04:13.321 --> 00:04:14.100
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.980
<v Speaker 1>they took Transylvania back this time </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

84
00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.350
<v Speaker 1>They had an even bigger taste for </v>
<v Speaker 1>payback.</v>

85
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.713
<v Speaker 1>So maybe you remember this other video </v>
<v Speaker 1>where I told you about the dictatorship </v>

86
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:28.104
<v Speaker 1>of Nicolae Ceausescu if you've seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know that the communist </v>

87
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.161
<v Speaker 1>Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:32.161 --> 00:04:35.190
<v Speaker 1>it was the closest thing to a European </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea that existed.</v>

89
00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.233
<v Speaker 1>One in every 30 Romanians was a part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political police and so they </v>

90
00:04:39.211 --> 00:04:41.670
<v Speaker 1>prosecuted not only those who oppose the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

91
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:46.410
<v Speaker 1>but even those you dare to speak </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian from one day to the other,</v>

92
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>Ceausescu close newspapers and forced </v>
<v Speaker 1>those chilies to speak Romanian,</v>

93
00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:51.460
<v Speaker 1>even in their own</v>

94
00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.293
<v Speaker 2>heights,</v>

95
00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:57.453
<v Speaker 1>major realization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad as it was forced a few Romanians to </v>

96
00:05:00.071 --> 00:05:03.400
<v Speaker 1>change their names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romanization was the same sort of thing,</v>

97
00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>just on a way bigger scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on for just a moment because it</v>

98
00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:08.644
<v Speaker 1>still doesn't stop here on their path to</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy even the last resemblance of </v>

99
00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:13.084
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Romanian Communist Party forced </v>

100
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:16.233
<v Speaker 1>thousands of citizens do you set up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hungarian speaking territories this </v>

101
00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:20.794
<v Speaker 1>way?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian speaking became a small </v>

102
00:05:21.611 --> 00:05:24.460
<v Speaker 1>minority in cities like or daycare or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday morning,</v>

103
00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.060
<v Speaker 1>basically the whole area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the borders with Hungary came a Romanian</v>

104
00:05:28.061 --> 00:05:31.780
<v Speaker 1>majority region this via all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a region that did manage to keep</v>

105
00:05:31.781 --> 00:05:33.960
<v Speaker 1>their language and traditions in taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>

106
00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:36.360
<v Speaker 1>We mentioned earlier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the so called secret lab</v>

107
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:41.330
<v Speaker 2>mania</v>

108
00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.060
<v Speaker 1>steals from us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in 1991,</v>

109
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:44.894
<v Speaker 1>Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it past this brand new democratic </v>

110
00:05:46.461 --> 00:05:47.294
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The constitution recognized the invite </v>

111
00:05:49.011 --> 00:05:51.290
<v Speaker 1>to speak Hungarian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you can imagine,</v>

112
00:05:51.291 --> 00:05:54.540
<v Speaker 1>after decades of hate against Budapest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those seekers will.</v>

113
00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:59.550
<v Speaker 1>They were far from happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean fiscally Romania.</v>

114
00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.223
<v Speaker 1>It's a very centralized country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost all the taxes are collected by </v>

115
00:06:07.641 --> 00:06:08.474
<v Speaker 1>the central government and then they </v>
<v Speaker 1>share that money among the regions with </v>

116
00:06:11.481 --> 00:06:12.314
<v Speaker 1>a focus on the poorest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once this boots Transylvanian in a </v>

117
00:06:14.811 --> 00:06:17.270
<v Speaker 1>pretty bad position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because,</v>

118
00:06:17.271 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are one of the wealthiest regions</v>

119
00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:26.633
<v Speaker 1>and so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well this is how a new political party </v>

120
00:06:28.801 --> 00:06:31.690
<v Speaker 1>was born and that would be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Alliance if I'm Gary,</v>

121
00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:35.940
<v Speaker 1>eons of Romania also known as Udm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All on surprisingly they want.</v>

122
00:06:35.970 --> 00:06:40.260
<v Speaker 1>All the elections in the regions were </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarians are the majority so well.</v>

123
00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:42.090
<v Speaker 1>What are their foundations?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:06:42.091 --> 00:06:45.690
<v Speaker 1>basically they claim that Romania is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially sucking their lifeblood.</v>

125
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:46.680
<v Speaker 1>That money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

126
00:06:46.681 --> 00:06:50.010
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much the same situation as </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Catalonia and their solutions.</v>

127
00:06:50.011 --> 00:06:50.844
<v Speaker 1>You end this Romanian losing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>imitating the fiscal model or they'd </v>

128
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:56.610
<v Speaker 1>another Spanish region and that would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Basque country.</v>

129
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.503
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other regions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bast citizens don't pay their taxes </v>

130
00:06:59.581 --> 00:07:01.560
<v Speaker 1>to Madrid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to their local government</v>

131
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:06.563
<v Speaker 1>collected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the local government has to give some </v>

132
00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:08.964
<v Speaker 1>share to the central government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the rest is to be managed the way </v>

133
00:07:11.221 --> 00:07:14.250
<v Speaker 1>the local government wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this was the system that was proposed</v>

134
00:07:14.251 --> 00:07:17.820
<v Speaker 1>by the seekers in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guess what?</v>

135
00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:19.650
<v Speaker 1>The Romanian government replies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

136
00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:21.240
<v Speaker 1>they said it was against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>

137
00:07:21.270 --> 00:07:24.420
<v Speaker 1>There are any constitution starts off by</v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that it is a sovereign,</v>

138
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:27.750
<v Speaker 1>unitary and Indian visible country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

139
00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:28.584
<v Speaker 1>of course this is something that created</v>
<v Speaker 1>a whole lot of protests and a whole lot </v>

140
00:07:31.381 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>of different cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were a referendum attempts and all</v>

141
00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:35.064
<v Speaker 1>sorts of other symbolic objections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and these are all things that really </v>

142
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:38.973
<v Speaker 1>just the Romanian ruling class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manias ruling party threatens autonomy </v>

143
00:07:46.021 --> 00:07:49.590
<v Speaker 1>seeking Transylvanian Hungarians with </v>
<v Speaker 1>printers and punishment.</v>

144
00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.573
<v Speaker 1>Attempts that threatened the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitutional order of Romania should </v>

145
00:07:52.681 --> 00:07:55.260
<v Speaker 1>be punished with prison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been following the case of the</v>

146
00:07:55.290 --> 00:07:58.260
<v Speaker 1>Catalonian separatists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this might sound pretty familiar to</v>

147
00:07:58.261 --> 00:08:00.720
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a second because one of</v>

148
00:08:00.721 --> 00:08:02.340
<v Speaker 1>the best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's yet to come.</v>

149
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:08.180
<v Speaker 1>Autonomy or annexation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any of you have ever been hungry,</v>

150
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you might've seen someone </v>
<v Speaker 1>wearing this tee shirt with this map.</v>

151
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:16.040
<v Speaker 1>It represents the shape of hungry before</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing a part of that territory's before</v>

152
00:08:16.041 --> 00:08:17.390
<v Speaker 1>World War One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

153
00:08:17.391 --> 00:08:19.740
<v Speaker 1>Even today in the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of fun,</v>

154
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:20.574
<v Speaker 1>Gary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and keep dreaming about taking that old </v>

155
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.730
<v Speaker 1>empire back and among them you'll find </v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidents of Viktor Orban,</v>

156
00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.930
<v Speaker 1>the Vladimir Putin.</v>

157
00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.380
<v Speaker 2>You just</v>

158
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:31.243
<v Speaker 1>like the Russian president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Orban is famous for prosecuting </v>

159
00:08:33.371 --> 00:08:34.204
<v Speaker 1>journalists who dare to criticize him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has passed anti gay laws and he wins </v>

160
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:41.820
<v Speaker 1>elections with 60 percent of the votes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course like every year to Putin.</v>

161
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>Orbin likes to rule not only his own </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

162
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>but others too or bonds supports the </v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomy of the CSI.</v>

163
00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:50.170
<v Speaker 1>Kelly's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

164
00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

165
00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:51.483
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does a president from another </v>

166
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>country missed with the internal </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics of another?</v>

167
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:56.424
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end of the day what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seekers wanted just to have more </v>

168
00:08:58.861 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 1>autonomy but without leaving Romania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

169
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact they're senior citizens are also</v>

170
00:09:04.050 --> 00:09:04.883
<v Speaker 1>his citizens</v>

171
00:09:07.730 --> 00:09:10.340
<v Speaker 1>grants citizenship rights to ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarians abroad.</v>

172
00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:11.181
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that,</v>

173
00:09:11.181 --> 00:09:12.014
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those Transylvanian born </v>

174
00:09:13.041 --> 00:09:15.080
<v Speaker 1>Hungarians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have two passports.</v>

175
00:09:15.081 --> 00:09:15.914
<v Speaker 1>They have the right to study in Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course they get to vote in </v>

176
00:09:17.940 --> 00:09:20.090
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This last thing,</v>

177
00:09:20.210 --> 00:09:21.620
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty good for urban.</v>

178
00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:24.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean he's popular in suite of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hungarian borders,</v>

179
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:27.590
<v Speaker 1>but outside he absolutely steals the </v>
<v Speaker 1>show.</v>

180
00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:31.700
<v Speaker 1>Ninety five percent of Hungarians from </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad voted for his party at the latest</v>

181
00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:33.560
<v Speaker 1>legislative elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

182
00:09:33.561 --> 00:09:34.394
<v Speaker 1>Romania considers these rights for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seekers as a complete violation of that </v>

183
00:09:37.130 --> 00:09:42.130
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In their opinion.</v>

184
00:09:42.591 --> 00:09:43.424
<v Speaker 1>If you voted to different countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't be loyal to the one where you </v>

185
00:09:46.251 --> 00:09:49.190
<v Speaker 1>live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All this means that diplomatic relations</v>

186
00:09:49.191 --> 00:09:52.850
<v Speaker 1>between Hungary and Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty darn complicated,</v>

187
00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:53.773
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this open can use Romania as </v>
<v Speaker 1>an antagonist to his nationalist </v>

188
00:09:57.141 --> 00:10:00.650
<v Speaker 1>propaganda and then Romania where it </v>
<v Speaker 1>gets a great chance to give some shit to</v>

189
00:10:00.651 --> 00:10:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Hungary when it comes to European </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

190
00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:07.950
<v Speaker 1>So now this probably leads you onto the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question of,</v>

191
00:10:07.951 --> 00:10:09.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the European Union?</v>

192
00:10:09.421 --> 00:10:11.220
<v Speaker 1>Think about all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is,</v>

193
00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:13.770
<v Speaker 1>despite the Council of Europe writing </v>
<v Speaker 1>memorandums,</v>

194
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:15.720
<v Speaker 1>would they defend the rights of ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>minorities?</v>

195
00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.300
<v Speaker 1>Brussels would never let Hungary when at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day,</v>

196
00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:19.193
<v Speaker 1>Viktor Orban is like the Dracula </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankenstein and Freddy Kruger of </v>

197
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 1>European politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as long as things don't turn ugly,</v>

198
00:10:25.110 --> 00:10:29.070
<v Speaker 1>don't expect any position from any EU </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution or politician</v>

199
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.033
<v Speaker 1>is what we think our official politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we'd love to know what you </v>

200
00:10:35.871 --> 00:10:36.704
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Transylvania should have </v>

201
00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:39.570
<v Speaker 1>its own autonomy or perhaps this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

202
00:10:39.571 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>This attempts by hungry to get some sway</v>
<v Speaker 1>back on that form it territories.</v>

203
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:44.113
