1
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:09.990
<v Speaker 1>Imagine in a country with a population </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Manhattan,</v>

2
00:00:09.991 --> 00:00:14.940
<v Speaker 1>but with huge reserves of oil and gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country surrounded by the wealthiest</v>

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.940
<v Speaker 1>oil rich monarchies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or am I talking about?</v>

4
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be Bahrain so tiny that we </v>

5
00:00:21.481 --> 00:00:26.481
<v Speaker 1>almost can't see it on the map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

6
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>

7
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:30.610
<v Speaker 1>Life must be wonderful hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

8
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Money for everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A prosperous economy and amazing growth.</v>

9
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.550
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>true</v>

11
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.260
<v Speaker 1>brain downgraded to junk as political </v>
<v Speaker 1>crackdown continues unabated.</v>

12
00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.120
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that right?</v>

13
00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain debt is considered to be a junk </v>
<v Speaker 1>bonds on the international market.</v>

14
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.963
<v Speaker 1>This means investors are so hesitant </v>
<v Speaker 1>about their economy that they don't </v>

15
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.480
<v Speaker 1>believe Bahrain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be able to give back those loans.</v>

16
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.150
<v Speaker 1>The truth is things in Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting really,</v>

17
00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:06.984
<v Speaker 1>really sour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've followed visual politic for a </v>

18
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know that within the Islamic</v>

19
00:01:10.651 --> 00:01:15.651
<v Speaker 1>world there are two big groups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims and well,</v>

20
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.420
<v Speaker 1>they really hate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

21
00:01:18.421 --> 00:01:19.254
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is something like the Sunni</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim Hollywood and the Islamic </v>

22
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.340
<v Speaker 1>Republic of Iran is of the same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for the sheer Muslims,</v>

23
00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.470
<v Speaker 1>this is why they've been in a state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cold war for decades,</v>

24
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.980
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

25
00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.813
<v Speaker 1>in the context of this Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain is actually in the funniest </v>

26
00:01:38.821 --> 00:01:40.710
<v Speaker 1>position of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically in this country,</v>

27
00:01:40.711 --> 00:01:42.890
<v Speaker 1>the majority of the population is Shia </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim.</v>

28
00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:46.290
<v Speaker 1>At the Royal House that rules the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is Sunni Muslim.</v>

29
00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.213
<v Speaker 1>This is why that monarchs stuff turns </v>
<v Speaker 1>political oppression into something of </v>

30
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.470
<v Speaker 1>an art form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

31
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:56.580
<v Speaker 1>so so far nothing in this video has </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably surprised you're that much.</v>

32
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.443
<v Speaker 1>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the title of this video is why Bahrain </v>

33
00:01:59.431 --> 00:02:02.400
<v Speaker 1>rain could become the world's wealthiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>country or something like that.</v>

34
00:02:02.401 --> 00:02:03.720
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time of recording,</v>

35
00:02:03.721 --> 00:02:06.330
<v Speaker 1>we haven't actually decided the title of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video,</v>

36
00:02:06.331 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>but so why don't we say something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that?</v>

37
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this rate discovers largest </v>

38
00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.320
<v Speaker 1>oil field in countries since 1932.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

39
00:02:19.321 --> 00:02:21.660
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They already had dinosaur juice,</v>

40
00:02:21.661 --> 00:02:22.494
<v Speaker 1>but now they have even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically Bahrain could have more oil </v>

41
00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.200
<v Speaker 1>than Russia and with a fraction of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia's population,</v>

42
00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.710
<v Speaker 1>so basically this means that there are </v>
<v Speaker 1>less people to split the money with,</v>

43
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.723
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this enough to be the wealthiest </v>

44
00:02:38.731 --> 00:02:39.690
<v Speaker 1>country on the planet?</v>

45
00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:40.553
<v Speaker 1>Why even with sonar trial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are Bahrain's data barns still </v>

46
00:02:44.341 --> 00:02:47.580
<v Speaker 1>considered to be junk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What the hell is going on in Bahrain?</v>

47
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer all of </v>

48
00:02:49.981 --> 00:02:51.900
<v Speaker 1>those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as always,</v>

49
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:57.230
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>cage.</v>

50
00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:02.280
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If any of you out there,</v>

51
00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:05.770
<v Speaker 1>once it become a dictator one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here are some pro tips.</v>

52
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two ways to make people follow</v>

53
00:03:08.381 --> 00:03:09.310
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>

54
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.293
<v Speaker 1>good old oppression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem with that though is that if </v>

55
00:03:12.041 --> 00:03:14.560
<v Speaker 1>you go too crazy with the oppression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're gonna risk.</v>

56
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>A popular uprising and maybe ending up </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Gaddafi.</v>

57
00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.770
<v Speaker 1>There was a band that involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good time.</v>

58
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't watch that video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've told you thousands of times,</v>

59
00:03:24.011 --> 00:03:27.400
<v Speaker 1>Aaron visual politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being a dictator is a risky job.</v>

60
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.740
<v Speaker 1>Not many of them go and die of old age.</v>

61
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Sure,</v>

62
00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.013
<v Speaker 1>but there is an alternative and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthier and it's more sustainable and </v>

63
00:03:37.481 --> 00:03:40.090
<v Speaker 1>is what we're calling the money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

64
00:03:40.091 --> 00:03:40.924
<v Speaker 1>Strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically you shower all of your </v>

65
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:46.300
<v Speaker 1>citizens in gold if that wealthy and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't need to get a job,</v>

66
00:03:46.301 --> 00:03:51.301
<v Speaker 1>they don't worry about politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

67
00:03:52.861 --> 00:03:53.694
<v Speaker 1>so the Al Khalifa family,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruling family in Bahrain has </v>

68
00:03:56.011 --> 00:03:59.070
<v Speaker 1>combined both of these methods in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>effective fashion.</v>

69
00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.050
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister who happens to be the</v>

70
00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:01.884
<v Speaker 1>kings uncle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>holds the world record for the longest </v>

71
00:04:03.931 --> 00:04:07.020
<v Speaker 1>lasting ruler.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has been in power since 1971.</v>

72
00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:11.633
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can I Sunni Muslim families stay in </v>

73
00:04:13.771 --> 00:04:14.604
<v Speaker 1>power for such a long time in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with a sheer majority </v>

74
00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:21.740
<v Speaker 1>population?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:22.603
<v Speaker 1>let's be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we have the good old iron fist </v>

76
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 1>protest against the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

77
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.473
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll automatically be considered a </v>

78
00:04:28.531 --> 00:04:29.364
<v Speaker 1>terrorist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll go to jail and you're probably </v>

79
00:04:31.081 --> 00:04:33.660
<v Speaker 1>either be given the death penalty or </v>
<v Speaker 1>exiles,</v>

80
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.940
<v Speaker 1>and we're not talking about an isolated </v>
<v Speaker 1>example here.</v>

81
00:04:35.941 --> 00:04:36.774
<v Speaker 1>This is something that happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every single rain strips 115 of </v>

82
00:04:46.081 --> 00:04:46.914
<v Speaker 1>nationality over terrorism allocations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over 700 people in Bahrain have had </v>

83
00:04:51.961 --> 00:04:54.440
<v Speaker 1>their citizenship revoked since 2010.</v>

84
00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

85
00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:01.620
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're going to say.</v>

86
00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:02.520
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on,</v>

87
00:05:02.521 --> 00:05:03.354
<v Speaker 1>Simon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't be such a snowflake and other </v>

88
00:05:05.311 --> 00:05:08.200
<v Speaker 1>democratic countries that Retalia </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizenship too,</v>

89
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.900
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

90
00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.710
<v Speaker 1>you're right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the difference is the proportions.</v>

91
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.693
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United Kingdom there are some </v>

92
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>examples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure,</v>

93
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:21.030
<v Speaker 1>but in fall rain we're talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds are so now you might say,</v>

94
00:05:21.031 --> 00:05:22.890
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are changing Simon.</v>

95
00:05:22.891 --> 00:05:24.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean the world is evolving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Middle East,</v>

96
00:05:24.991 --> 00:05:27.160
<v Speaker 1>it's getting more modern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:28.680
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this case,</v>

98
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:30.090
<v Speaker 1>that's not true at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

99
00:05:30.091 --> 00:05:32.040
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2011,</v>

100
00:05:32.041 --> 00:05:35.480
<v Speaker 1>the Shia citizens took to the streets as</v>
<v Speaker 1>part of the Arabs,</v>

101
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:36.720
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

102
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.480
<v Speaker 1>Rabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>along with the United Arab Emirates sent</v>

103
00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 1>troops to help the Bahraini government </v>
<v Speaker 1>to suppress these demonstrations.</v>

104
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.873
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one out of every 500 people in Bahrain </v>

105
00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:54.360
<v Speaker 1>are political prisoners among them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many leaders,</v>

106
00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.353
<v Speaker 1>but on any of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2011 Bahrain passed new laws to </v>

107
00:05:58.101 --> 00:06:00.410
<v Speaker 1>make it easier to retire one </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizenship.</v>

108
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.483
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>losing Bahraini citizenship is a big </v>

109
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.293
<v Speaker 1>shame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Citizenship means that you lose all of </v>

110
00:06:10.421 --> 00:06:11.254
<v Speaker 1>your rights.</v>

111
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

112
00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.100
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to give up your passport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your driver's license.</v>

113
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.140
<v Speaker 1>You cannot own a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car,</v>

114
00:06:19.141 --> 00:06:21.060
<v Speaker 1>a phone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a bank account.</v>

115
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.970
<v Speaker 1>You cannot marry in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you decide to leave,</v>

116
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:27.090
<v Speaker 1>you cannot go back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to stay well,</v>

117
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.890
<v Speaker 1>you can't leave.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>

118
00:06:28.891 --> 00:06:32.250
<v Speaker 1>opposing the government tends you into a</v>
<v Speaker 1>second class citizen and well,</v>

119
00:06:32.251 --> 00:06:35.910
<v Speaker 1>this is a big shame because being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>first lawsuit as an embodied brain,</v>

120
00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:38.040
<v Speaker 1>it's actually pretty great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this,</v>

121
00:06:38.041 --> 00:06:41.040
<v Speaker 1>this is where that money for nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy comes into play.</v>

122
00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.250
<v Speaker 1>This is what we call Bahrain's social </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract.</v>

123
00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you forget about politics,</v>

124
00:06:46.321 --> 00:06:49.050
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to worry about anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for a job,</v>

125
00:06:49.051 --> 00:06:50.580
<v Speaker 1>you can get one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the governments,</v>

126
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:51.623
<v Speaker 1>don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody's going to check if you even go </v>

127
00:06:53.581 --> 00:06:54.414
<v Speaker 1>to the office,</v>

128
00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.820
<v Speaker 1>need to pick up some things in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>supermarket.</v>

129
00:06:59.821 --> 00:07:00.654
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is super cheap because it's </v>

130
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:04.290
<v Speaker 1>all subsidized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Need fuel for your car.</v>

131
00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's also crazy cheap.</v>

132
00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.130
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be wondering,</v>

133
00:07:08.131 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens if I don't want to work for</v>

134
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:10.081
<v Speaker 1>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon?</v>

135
00:07:10.081 --> 00:07:12.900
<v Speaker 1>I don't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to work in a private business.</v>

136
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:14.280
<v Speaker 1>Well still,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no problem.</v>

137
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.680
<v Speaker 1>The government guarantees quotas for </v>
<v Speaker 1>local workers,</v>

138
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:19.170
<v Speaker 1>so no immigrants is gonna take away your</v>
<v Speaker 1>job.</v>

139
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.530
<v Speaker 1>This is actually the funniest part of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all the immigrant quote.</v>

140
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.750
<v Speaker 1>Basically they're there to reserve the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coolest jobs for the local.</v>

141
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:26.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

142
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:32.093
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of bank workers have to be </v>

143
00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:36.420
<v Speaker 1>from Bahrain in the cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fancy shops.</v>

144
00:07:36.421 --> 00:07:39.000
<v Speaker 1>It's 30 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but construction work as well.</v>

145
00:07:39.001 --> 00:07:40.500
<v Speaker 1>That's just five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

146
00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:43.020
<v Speaker 1>Because he wants to lay bricks under the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hot bar,</v>

147
00:07:43.021 --> 00:07:43.854
<v Speaker 1>rainy son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why it 55 percent of the </v>

148
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:47.253
<v Speaker 1>Bahraini population are immigrants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the ones who actually get the </v>

149
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:52.770
<v Speaker 1>countries work done and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>

150
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:54.510
<v Speaker 1>I need to make an aside here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

151
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.720
<v Speaker 1>having more immigrants than locals is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very common in the Middle East.</v>

152
00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.583
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign citizens make up 75 percent of </v>

153
00:08:00.331 --> 00:08:04.170
<v Speaker 1>Qatar's population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Bahrain is a pioneer in another way.</v>

154
00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.490
<v Speaker 1>They are one of the few countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>ban the socorro and so.</v>

155
00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the godfather roller balance?</v>

156
00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:13.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a sort of modern day slavery.</v>

157
00:08:13.590 --> 00:08:17.490
<v Speaker 1>The Catholicism links foreign workers </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a national who is that patron?</v>

158
00:08:17.670 --> 00:08:18.503
<v Speaker 1>This patron can decide whether the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants can change his or her job or </v>

159
00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:23.730
<v Speaker 1>even leave the country at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So well.</v>

160
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain has actually abolished this </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhuman practice so.</v>

161
00:08:26.881 --> 00:08:28.560
<v Speaker 1>Well that's good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

162
00:08:28.561 --> 00:08:29.394
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what you might wonder as well kind of </v>

163
00:08:31.051 --> 00:08:35.490
<v Speaker 1>country where nobody works actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosper and the answer is,</v>

164
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.200
<v Speaker 1>well of course not</v>

165
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.750
<v Speaker 1>$120 living without working is </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

166
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:53.550
<v Speaker 1>They already manages in Bahrain because </v>
<v Speaker 1>of one thing,</v>

167
00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.113
<v Speaker 1>oil makes up more than 60 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their exports in 75 percent of the </v>

168
00:09:02.411 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 1>government's income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plus in order to cover all of the costs,</v>

169
00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.130
<v Speaker 1>the government needs the oil barrel </v>
<v Speaker 1>price at $120 less than that.</v>

170
00:09:09.310 --> 00:09:11.440
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make enough profit to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends meet.</v>

171
00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:13.000
<v Speaker 1>And now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

172
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:18.100
<v Speaker 1>is $120 too much or too little?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well look at it's historic.</v>

173
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 2>That happens</v>

174
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:26.650
<v Speaker 1>in July of 2008 when oil was $147,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you know,</v>

175
00:09:26.651 --> 00:09:31.651
<v Speaker 1>in 2014 oil prices fell in January 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went down a dozen little as $26.</v>

176
00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:36.400
<v Speaker 1>And this explains news like</v>

177
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:37.533
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

178
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:41.383
<v Speaker 1>p cuts Bahrain rating b plus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did they do with low prices and </v>

179
00:09:45.261 --> 00:09:46.094
<v Speaker 1>lack of income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they took on more and more </v>

180
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.320
<v Speaker 1>debt and the results it speaks for </v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

181
00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.213
<v Speaker 1>In just two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public debt has gone from seven percent </v>

182
00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:57.380
<v Speaker 1>to 70 percent and despite crude oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices going up again,</v>

183
00:09:57.381 --> 00:10:01.700
<v Speaker 1>it seems pretty unlikely that it will </v>
<v Speaker 1>reach $120 a barrel anytime soon.</v>

184
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:05.810
<v Speaker 1>So far Bahrain has already revoked </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies on meat products and.</v>

185
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.480
<v Speaker 1>Well this is only the beginning.</v>

186
00:10:12.670 --> 00:10:17.670
<v Speaker 1>We'll introduce VAT by end of 2018 says </v>
<v Speaker 1>finance minister.</v>

187
00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.070
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had that right.</v>

188
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:19.904
<v Speaker 1>In Bahrain there is no income tax and so</v>
<v Speaker 1>far they didn't even have indirect </v>

189
00:10:23.121 --> 00:10:23.954
<v Speaker 1>taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the situation is desperate and they </v>

190
00:10:25.791 --> 00:10:29.600
<v Speaker 1>need to create a new taxes that simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't even exist before.</v>

191
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:32.210
<v Speaker 1>But what does this mean for Bar rain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:10:32.211 --> 00:10:34.850
<v Speaker 1>do you remember how this particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian rule works?</v>

193
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've sheer population except Sony </v>

194
00:10:37.131 --> 00:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>oppression in exchange for money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

195
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:44.141
<v Speaker 1>So when the economics fail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics fails to now only a miracle can</v>

196
00:10:44.151 --> 00:10:44.984
<v Speaker 1>save the outcome for family and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that miracle is this one oil miracle so </v>

197
00:10:56.121 --> 00:10:58.820
<v Speaker 1>far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain produces 200,000 barrels a day.</v>

198
00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>This is nothing compared with the tens </v>
<v Speaker 1>of millions in Saudi Arabia.</v>

199
00:11:02.661 --> 00:11:05.930
<v Speaker 1>But it's insane when we take into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account in the country's size,</v>

200
00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:06.853
<v Speaker 1>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain has just discovered a big old </v>

201
00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:10.693
<v Speaker 1>oil that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And they could start pumping dinosaur </v>

202
00:11:12.141 --> 00:11:17.141
<v Speaker 1>juice in as little as five years </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to optimistic analysts.</v>

203
00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:21.860
<v Speaker 1>This could double production and ends </v>
<v Speaker 1>the deficit problem.</v>

204
00:11:22.070 --> 00:11:22.903
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this all sounds fantastic and </v>

205
00:11:23.601 --> 00:11:25.430
<v Speaker 1>wonderful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is the problem?</v>

206
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:26.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you watch visual politic often you </v>

207
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:28.453
<v Speaker 1>probably have guessed and that's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>not every type of oil costs the same to </v>

208
00:11:31.911 --> 00:11:32.744
<v Speaker 1>extract.</v>

209
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.210
<v Speaker 2>And</v>

210
00:11:37.210 --> 00:11:40.810
<v Speaker 1>this new oil that has all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients needed to be very,</v>

211
00:11:40.990 --> 00:11:42.730
<v Speaker 1>very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

212
00:11:42.731 --> 00:11:43.564
<v Speaker 1>it's underwater.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that Bahrain has to build </v>

213
00:11:44.891 --> 00:11:47.740
<v Speaker 1>platforms on the sea floor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second is shale oil,</v>

214
00:11:47.741 --> 00:11:48.574
<v Speaker 1>which means it's under a rock.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need fracking technology to break </v>

215
00:11:51.581 --> 00:11:55.150
<v Speaker 1>that rock and that fracking is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive.</v>

216
00:11:58.520 --> 00:11:59.353
<v Speaker 1>In this chart you can see the cost of </v>
<v Speaker 1>production of a barrel of oil in </v>

217
00:12:02.361 --> 00:12:03.194
<v Speaker 1>different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't know how much fracking would </v>

218
00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:06.524
<v Speaker 1>cost in Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can look to see how much it </v>

219
00:12:08.481 --> 00:12:09.650
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

220
00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:12.650
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention to the chart,</v>

221
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:13.633
<v Speaker 1>you can see that fracking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shale oil is significantly more </v>

222
00:12:16.281 --> 00:12:20.210
<v Speaker 1>expensive than extracting oil in more </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional methods.</v>

223
00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 1>If Bahrain wants to make a profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the barrels should cost over $60,</v>

224
00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:27.260
<v Speaker 1>but since they need a huge profit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>cover all of their expenses,</v>

225
00:12:27.350 --> 00:12:30.860
<v Speaker 1>they need an even higher market price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So wait a second.</v>

226
00:12:30.861 --> 00:12:33.050
<v Speaker 1>What?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can save Bahrain from ruin?</v>

227
00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:34.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is the same as other Middle </v>

228
00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:37.730
<v Speaker 1>Eastern countries and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversification.</v>

229
00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:41.480
<v Speaker 1>They need to produce other things that's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just oil and this explains news.</v>

230
00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:43.133
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

231
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.083
<v Speaker 1>La opens $90,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollar factory of the future in </v>

232
00:12:51.241 --> 00:12:52.074
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course if you really want to </v>

233
00:12:53.641 --> 00:12:57.900
<v Speaker 1>attract business from other industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need something other than oil beds.</v>

234
00:12:57.930 --> 00:12:58.763
<v Speaker 1>You need rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need clear taxes and you need a </v>

235
00:13:00.631 --> 00:13:03.270
<v Speaker 1>government that doesn't send people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>jail without a trial.</v>

236
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:04.133
<v Speaker 1>We've told you several times on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel do buying and generally </v>

237
00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:07.314
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United Arab Emirates started down </v>

238
00:13:08.731 --> 00:13:11.190
<v Speaker 1>this path of years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Saudi Arabia,</v>

239
00:13:11.191 --> 00:13:12.024
<v Speaker 1>it's probably going to follow suit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we're not really sure about </v>

240
00:13:14.071 --> 00:13:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>

241
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:18.390
<v Speaker 1>it's only a matter of time before </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain's dance doing the same,</v>

242
00:13:18.690 --> 00:13:19.523
<v Speaker 1>but of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if those economic reforms mean that the </v>

243
00:13:21.061 --> 00:13:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Bahraini people have to pay taxes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>even,</v>

244
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:24.533
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work hard than the ruling family is </v>

245
00:13:26.551 --> 00:13:27.560
<v Speaker 1>going to be in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

246
00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.433
<v Speaker 1>So the big question now becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think the Bahraini citizens are </v>

247
00:13:36.171 --> 00:13:38.720
<v Speaker 1>going to accept such an authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments?</v>

248
00:13:38.721 --> 00:13:41.870
<v Speaker 1>If they no longer enjoying the money for</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing policy,</v>

249
00:13:41.990 --> 00:13:42.823
<v Speaker 1>do you think they're going to find a way</v>
<v Speaker 1>to reform the system while please leave </v>
