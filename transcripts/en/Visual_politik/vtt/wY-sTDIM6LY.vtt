<v Speaker 2>1945</v>

<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:21.640
<v Speaker 3>becomes the scene of an unforgettable </v>
<v Speaker 3>ceremony marking the complete and primal</v>

5
00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:22.670
<v Speaker 3>surrender of Japan.</v>

6
00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.260
<v Speaker 2>On August the 15th of 1945 having </v>
<v Speaker 2>suffered the only nuclear bomb attack in</v>

7
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.313
<v Speaker 2>history only a few days previously for </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese government's finally </v>

8
00:00:33.051 --> 00:00:33.884
<v Speaker 2>surrendered.</v>

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 4>Ash Supreme Commander for the allied </v>
<v Speaker 4>powers.</v>

10
00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:40.753
<v Speaker 4>I announced my firm in the tradition of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the country that I represent crocheted </v>

11
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 4>and the discharge if my responsibilities</v>
<v Speaker 4>while taking all national,</v>

12
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.594
<v Speaker 4>sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 4>just position to ensure at the term </v>

13
00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:57.063
<v Speaker 4>surrender our pull,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a pump play and faithfully complied </v>

14
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:01.634
<v Speaker 4>with.</v>

15
00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.870
<v Speaker 2>At that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan was the defeated country.</v>

16
00:01:10.871 --> 00:01:12.850
<v Speaker 2>Its economy was shattered in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese.</v>

17
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:13.684
<v Speaker 2>It's suffered unimaginable damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only were they immersed in extreme </v>

18
00:01:17.471 --> 00:01:18.304
<v Speaker 2>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had also lost more than 3 million </v>

19
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.210
<v Speaker 2>compatriots,</v>
<v Speaker 2>brothers,</v>

20
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.880
<v Speaker 2>sons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even mothers wore it.</v>

21
00:01:24.881 --> 00:01:25.714
<v Speaker 2>Takes a terrible toll with this grim </v>
<v Speaker 2>picture is the situation in 1945 the </v>

22
00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 2>question that we might ask ourselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

23
00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:32.763
<v Speaker 2>how did Japan managed to become one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the greatest economic powers on the </v>

24
00:01:36.011 --> 00:01:36.844
<v Speaker 2>planet in such a short amount of time?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And how did the Japanese recover so </v>

25
00:01:39.551 --> 00:01:41.080
<v Speaker 2>quickly with such might.</v>

26
00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.063
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.263
<v Speaker 2>Dev you out here on visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've already talked about the </v>

28
00:01:52.131 --> 00:01:55.010
<v Speaker 2>differences between the German model and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese model.</v>

29
00:01:55.011 --> 00:01:59.090
<v Speaker 2>We've also told you about how Japan </v>
<v Speaker 2>transformed from a Med eval country to a</v>

30
00:01:59.091 --> 00:02:01.280
<v Speaker 2>thriving modern nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

31
00:02:01.281 --> 00:02:02.114
<v Speaker 2>we still need to answer the question of </v>
<v Speaker 2>how Japan managed to become a great </v>

32
00:02:05.001 --> 00:02:05.834
<v Speaker 2>wells power interest a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me tell you right now for the </v>

33
00:02:08.151 --> 00:02:08.984
<v Speaker 2>Japanese model is rather peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so we're going to need more than one </v>

34
00:02:13.011 --> 00:02:13.844
<v Speaker 2>video to explain it here in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to see a few brush strokes </v>

35
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:20.620
<v Speaker 2>in the whole picture that don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More chapters are absolutely going</v>

36
00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:21.583
<v Speaker 1>falling.</v>

37
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.540
<v Speaker 2>The post war 45 it seemed like </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything that had been built after the</v>

38
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.120
<v Speaker 2>Meiji Restoration of 1868 I simply </v>
<v Speaker 2>evaporated.</v>

39
00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.013
<v Speaker 2>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as if that weren't enough for the first </v>

40
00:02:39.821 --> 00:02:43.150
<v Speaker 2>time in its history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan was occupied by the United States.</v>

41
00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.983
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.330
<v Speaker 2>Hold on for just a second because it </v>
<v Speaker 2>wasn't all bad news.</v>

43
00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.253
<v Speaker 2>As we'll see.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese also had three aces up </v>

44
00:02:54.181 --> 00:02:55.014
<v Speaker 2>their sleeves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three characteristics that would launch </v>

45
00:02:57.061 --> 00:02:57.894
<v Speaker 2>their country into the stratosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>turning us into one of the richest </v>

46
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 2>countries on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that's all in spite of the many </v>

47
00:03:04.361 --> 00:03:05.194
<v Speaker 2>political mistakes that both the </v>
<v Speaker 2>occupation forces and the local </v>

48
00:03:07.361 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 2>authorities would make over the coming </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

49
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:19.043
<v Speaker 2>So you want to know what the three </v>
<v Speaker 2>ingredients where the main ingredients </v>

50
00:03:21.571 --> 00:03:23.970
<v Speaker 2>of this Japanese success recipe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

51
00:03:23.971 --> 00:03:24.804
<v Speaker 2>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge ability and his predilection for </v>

52
00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:30.480
<v Speaker 2>saving you see in Asian countries in </v>
<v Speaker 2>general in Japan,</v>

53
00:03:30.481 --> 00:03:33.690
<v Speaker 2>is no exception.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Family is trying to save every penny and</v>

54
00:03:33.691 --> 00:03:36.090
<v Speaker 2>much more so than almost any other place</v>
<v Speaker 2>on it.</v>

55
00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:36.924
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

56
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.620
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.453
<v Speaker 2>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>While there are many explanations for </v>

58
00:03:41.081 --> 00:03:43.120
<v Speaker 2>this phenomena,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cultural preference,</v>

59
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.640
<v Speaker 2>trends towards less consumption in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>present,</v>

60
00:03:45.641 --> 00:03:46.474
<v Speaker 2>in order to spend more in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or just because of a lack of public </v>

61
00:03:49.151 --> 00:03:49.984
<v Speaker 2>services,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which tend to be very limited in this </v>

62
00:03:51.821 --> 00:03:56.821
<v Speaker 2>part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of these explanations may have a bit</v>

63
00:03:57.011 --> 00:03:59.020
<v Speaker 2>of truth to them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but regardless,</v>

64
00:03:59.021 --> 00:04:01.780
<v Speaker 2>these huge amounts of savings all then </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested,</v>

65
00:04:01.781 --> 00:04:02.614
<v Speaker 2>which creates productive capital,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that obviously leads to higher </v>

66
00:04:05.261 --> 00:04:06.720
<v Speaker 2>production and 12th level.</v>

67
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:08.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

68
00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.140
<v Speaker 2>savings that allow us to direct our </v>
<v Speaker 2>efforts for a long time.</v>

69
00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.033
<v Speaker 2>Not to satisfy our immediate needs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to worry about satisfying or future </v>

70
00:04:16.521 --> 00:04:19.880
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We produce capital goods so that they in</v>

71
00:04:19.881 --> 00:04:20.714
<v Speaker 2>turn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturer the future consumer goods </v>

72
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.530
<v Speaker 2>we may need Juan Ramon Ryo.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>

73
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.443
<v Speaker 2>So the first days that Japan had up its </v>
<v Speaker 2>sleeve after the war was an enormous </v>

74
00:04:29.391 --> 00:04:32.150
<v Speaker 2>propensity to save savings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>savings,</v>

75
00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:34.430
<v Speaker 2>and just bought savings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second,</v>

76
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.760
<v Speaker 2>it had a lot to do with the Meiji </v>
<v Speaker 2>Restoration of 18</v>

77
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.873
<v Speaker 1>the yes,</v>

78
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.740
<v Speaker 2>you'll see as we saw her in a previous </v>
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>

79
00:04:42.741 --> 00:04:43.574
<v Speaker 2>one of the first things the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 2>government did after the regime change </v>

80
00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 2>was bet on creating a very powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>educational system.</v>

81
00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.530
<v Speaker 2>They established universal primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and promoted universities,</v>

82
00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.720
<v Speaker 2>academies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>research centers,</v>

83
00:04:56.780 --> 00:04:59.150
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thus after the second world war,</v>

84
00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:00.013
<v Speaker 2>despite their situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese were the most well trained </v>

85
00:05:02.751 --> 00:05:03.584
<v Speaker 2>workers on the entire Asian continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course this entails a huge </v>

86
00:05:07.761 --> 00:05:08.630
<v Speaker 2>competitive advantage.</v>

87
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:09.573
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

88
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.073
<v Speaker 2>So one of the first measures taken after</v>
<v Speaker 2>the war was pushing the educational </v>

89
00:05:16.111 --> 00:05:18.420
<v Speaker 2>system even further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what's the third card?</v>

90
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:20.130
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is the one you can probably guess.</v>

91
00:05:20.131 --> 00:05:20.964
<v Speaker 2>And that's the Japanese is huge capacity</v>
<v Speaker 2>and willingness for working long hours </v>

92
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.230
<v Speaker 2>and in some cases they've even taken </v>
<v Speaker 2>things ranked to the extreme.</v>

93
00:05:28.231 --> 00:05:29.064
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know any other country in the </v>

94
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.044
<v Speaker 2>world and it has a word for death from </v>
<v Speaker 2>working too much Karoshi death from </v>

95
00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:39.030
<v Speaker 2>working too much is a public health </v>
<v Speaker 2>problem in Japan.</v>

96
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.860
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that all three of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors,</v>

97
00:05:40.861 --> 00:05:43.440
<v Speaker 2>they gave Japan a huge capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 2>recover,</v>

98
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:44.303
<v Speaker 2>grow and create a great deal of wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a second because while </v>

99
00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.233
<v Speaker 2>having seen all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly are the stages that Japan </v>

100
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:53.100
<v Speaker 2>goes through in order for this economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>miracle to happen?</v>

101
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen up</v>

102
00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:57.853
<v Speaker 5>day,</v>

103
00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.993
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

104
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:01.833
<v Speaker 2>the stages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the process we're about to explore </v>

105
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 2>starts with the u s is occupation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan.</v>

106
00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 2>After the end of the war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

107
00:06:09.981 --> 00:06:12.470
<v Speaker 2>the occupation forces had two major </v>
<v Speaker 2>priorities.</v>

108
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>Do you demilitarize and democratize </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan?</v>

109
00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:18.510
<v Speaker 2>It's around this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

110
00:06:18.511 --> 00:06:22.110
<v Speaker 2>that the new constitution establishing a</v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic system was created.</v>

111
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:22.973
<v Speaker 2>It equalized men's and women's rights </v>
<v Speaker 2>and it stripped to Japan if it's right </v>

112
00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.500
<v Speaker 2>to wage war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>dismantling its armed forces.</v>

113
00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:29.393
<v Speaker 2>In addition to the occupation forces </v>
<v Speaker 2>copied us institutions and launched </v>

114
00:06:32.131 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 2>reforms that had some benefits and any </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawbacks.</v>

115
00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.933
<v Speaker 2>One day we're going to need to talk </v>
<v Speaker 2>about how badly the military has always </v>

116
00:06:40.581 --> 00:06:42.920
<v Speaker 2>managed the economy of countries they've</v>
<v Speaker 2>controls,</v>

117
00:06:42.921 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 2>but that's something we'll deal with in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a future video.</v>

118
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:47.780
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that the priority of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>reforms was to eliminate,</v>

119
00:06:47.781 --> 00:06:49.990
<v Speaker 2>or at least to reduce the power of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>auto.</v>

120
00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.720
<v Speaker 2>Oxy supported Japanese expansionism and </v>
<v Speaker 2>militarism to do so.</v>

121
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:56.870
<v Speaker 2>The sale of lands from big landowners to</v>
<v Speaker 2>small farmers.</v>

122
00:06:56.900 --> 00:06:57.733
<v Speaker 2>It was approved measures were taken to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissolve these I babbsu large business </v>

123
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:02.480
<v Speaker 2>groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's engaged in many activities,</v>

124
00:07:02.481 --> 00:07:03.314
<v Speaker 2>but we're controlled by a single family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and antitrust law that outlawed </v>

125
00:07:06.051 --> 00:07:06.884
<v Speaker 2>monopolies was also passed in 1947 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the unionization of workers was also </v>

126
00:07:10.551 --> 00:07:11.384
<v Speaker 2>promoted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was done with the intention </v>

127
00:07:12.951 --> 00:07:14.870
<v Speaker 2>of achieving an economic power chain.</v>

128
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:17.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

129
00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:20.510
<v Speaker 2>some of these measures,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in addition to limiting the power of the</v>

130
00:07:20.511 --> 00:07:23.720
<v Speaker 2>great oligarchs also had some rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>positive consequences.</v>

131
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:26.360
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the land of distribution managed to turn</v>

132
00:07:26.361 --> 00:07:29.120
<v Speaker 2>many farmers into owners need demise of </v>
<v Speaker 2>many of these.</v>

133
00:07:29.121 --> 00:07:33.050
<v Speaker 2>I've soup to the emergence of many small</v>
<v Speaker 2>and medium sized enterprises.</v>

134
00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:37.340
<v Speaker 2>In spite of everything the recovery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was much slower than expected.</v>

135
00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:40.533
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the 1950s the country has is as it </v>

136
00:07:42.401 --> 00:07:43.810
<v Speaker 2>were,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a stroke of luck.</v>

137
00:07:43.870 --> 00:07:44.703
<v Speaker 2>The Korean War Tan Japan into one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>alliance forces suppliers there by </v>

138
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>boosting their exports and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>production southern leave,</v>

139
00:07:50.681 --> 00:07:54.700
<v Speaker 2>Japanese companies and politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they discovered the great global market</v>

140
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:55.623
<v Speaker 1>gets</v>

141
00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:57.743
<v Speaker 2>in 1953 production level says already </v>
<v Speaker 2>suppose to levels that have been right </v>

142
00:08:00.691 --> 00:08:01.524
<v Speaker 2>before the war and as the minutes of </v>
<v Speaker 2>class had a new priority boosting </v>

143
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.930
<v Speaker 2>economic growth through business.</v>

144
00:08:14.630 --> 00:08:15.463
<v Speaker 2>The economic takeoff folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the decades of the fifties sixties and </v>

145
00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 2>seventies miraculous years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were Japan's golden age.</v>

146
00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:28.730
<v Speaker 2>It was a time led by the Liberal </v>
<v Speaker 2>Democratic Party,</v>

147
00:08:28.731 --> 00:08:33.200
<v Speaker 2>a political party that ruled the country</v>
<v Speaker 2>for almost 40 uninterrupted years.</v>

148
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:34.490
<v Speaker 2>A few years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

149
00:08:34.491 --> 00:08:35.324
<v Speaker 2>it was discovered that the CIA actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>gave a lot of money to support the </v>

150
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:38.354
<v Speaker 2>party's political campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is also the party of the current </v>

151
00:08:41.031 --> 00:08:41.864
<v Speaker 2>Prime Minister Shinzo our bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that this party launched a </v>

152
00:08:50.571 --> 00:08:52.300
<v Speaker 2>very peculiar system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

153
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.143
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it promoted policies that favored </v>

154
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.123
<v Speaker 2>keeping inflation under control and </v>
<v Speaker 2>slowing down the growth of the public </v>

155
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.580
<v Speaker 2>sector as well as maintaining low taxes </v>
<v Speaker 2>and avoiding the accumulation of debt.</v>

156
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:07.020
<v Speaker 2>This is the opposite of what they do in </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like Argentina or obesity,</v>

157
00:09:07.021 --> 00:09:07.854
<v Speaker 2>for example.</v>

158
00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.370
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on just a second because that's not</v>

159
00:09:16.371 --> 00:09:16.791
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

160
00:09:16.791 --> 00:09:17.624
<v Speaker 2>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike what happens in other countries </v>

161
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:22.700
<v Speaker 2>that achieved great economic takeoff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that these governments,</v>

162
00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:24.920
<v Speaker 2>they were quite interventionalist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

163
00:09:24.921 --> 00:09:28.670
<v Speaker 2>they decided to promote certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>industries which they themselves chosen,</v>

164
00:09:28.730 --> 00:09:31.820
<v Speaker 2>which they helped grow from within the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government itself.</v>

165
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:32.713
<v Speaker 2>They also promoted a new counter </v>
<v Speaker 2>lization of national companies </v>

166
00:09:35.391 --> 00:09:39.350
<v Speaker 2>supposedly to avoid what they considered</v>
<v Speaker 2>to be excessive competition.</v>

167
00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.300
<v Speaker 2>Although you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't really know her,</v>

168
00:09:41.301 --> 00:09:42.134
<v Speaker 2>but that just sure sounds like a way for</v>
<v Speaker 2>them to help out their friends </v>

169
00:09:44.870 --> 00:09:47.840
<v Speaker 2>regardless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did have amazing results.</v>

170
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:53.023
<v Speaker 2>In the early 1960s Prime Minister High </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eto Keytar announced a plan to double </v>

171
00:09:56.031 --> 00:09:56.864
<v Speaker 2>the size of Japan's economy in just 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years to reach this goal of the country </v>

172
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:00.613
<v Speaker 2>needed to maintain an annual average </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth rate of 7.2% for that entire </v>

173
00:10:04.431 --> 00:10:05.264
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>International analysts considered it </v>

174
00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:08.110
<v Speaker 2>impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>10 years later,</v>

175
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:08.953
<v Speaker 2>Japan had far exceeded its goal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The country had Moza blind the size of </v>

176
00:10:11.451 --> 00:10:12.284
<v Speaker 2>its economy by 2.8 because he did an </v>
<v Speaker 2>average annual growth rate of more than </v>

177
00:10:15.591 --> 00:10:17.720
<v Speaker 2>9.3%</v>

178
00:10:20.090 --> 00:10:20.923
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

179
00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:24.470
<v Speaker 2>Dustin?</v>
<v Speaker 2>1973 the Japanese economy had multiplied</v>

180
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:29.500
<v Speaker 2>more than five since 1953 that is in </v>
<v Speaker 2>just 20 years on the other hand,</v>

181
00:10:30.711 --> 00:10:33.770
<v Speaker 2>GDP per capita and multiplied by four </v>
<v Speaker 2>and within a few years,</v>

182
00:10:33.771 --> 00:10:34.604
<v Speaker 2>Japan became the largest asset holder in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world and the largest humanitarian </v>

183
00:10:38.181 --> 00:10:41.210
<v Speaker 2>aid provider,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even the Tokyo Stock Exchange managed to</v>

184
00:10:41.211 --> 00:10:44.510
<v Speaker 2>outperform the New York Stock Exchange </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a short period of time.</v>

185
00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:48.920
<v Speaker 2>But you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is when a great controversy arose.</v>

186
00:10:52.150 --> 00:10:52.983
<v Speaker 2>I want to cite some defended the country</v>
<v Speaker 2>spectacular growth despite all of these </v>

187
00:10:55.891 --> 00:10:56.724
<v Speaker 2>government policies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is to say that the three things we </v>

188
00:10:58.231 --> 00:10:59.064
<v Speaker 2>covered at the beginning of this video </v>
<v Speaker 2>savings work and training was so strong </v>

189
00:11:01.561 --> 00:11:05.160
<v Speaker 2>that they managed to take off in spite </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the government's interference,</v>

190
00:11:05.190 --> 00:11:09.060
<v Speaker 2>but some argue that since the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>caps the macro economic parameters under</v>

191
00:11:09.061 --> 00:11:09.894
<v Speaker 2>control of these public policies </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually accelerated the country is </v>

192
00:11:13.441 --> 00:11:14.274
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

193
00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:17.833
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now the only question is which one do </v>

194
00:11:18.831 --> 00:11:20.650
<v Speaker 2>you think is right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Which group do you belong to?</v>

195
00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>While leave your answer in the comments </v>
<v Speaker 2>section below and also in this survey,</v>

196
00:11:24.350 --> 00:11:25.183
<v Speaker 2>what there's little doubt about though </v>
<v Speaker 2>is that it was exactly during that time </v>

197
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:33.200
<v Speaker 2>that some of the greatest imbalances </v>
<v Speaker 2>that lead the country into a huge crisis</v>

198
00:11:33.201 --> 00:11:35.690
<v Speaker 2>from which it hasn't yet recovered </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerged,</v>

199
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.810
<v Speaker 2>but we already talked about that in this</v>
<v Speaker 2>previous other video.</v>
