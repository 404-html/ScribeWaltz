<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.410
<v Speaker 2>Spain is known as who?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Your Iglesias,</v>

3
00:00:09.411 --> 00:00:10.244
<v Speaker 2>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the land of the Flamenco and high </v>

4
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:12.884
<v Speaker 2>unemployment rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even now when all of Europe is emerging </v>

5
00:00:15.261 --> 00:00:16.094
<v Speaker 2>from the crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this country maintains a higher </v>

6
00:00:17.961 --> 00:00:22.010
<v Speaker 2>unemployment rate than Iraq or Albania.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

7
00:00:22.011 --> 00:00:27.011
<v Speaker 2>Spain isn't exactly a role model as far </v>
<v Speaker 2>as economics is consent.</v>

8
00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.710
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's a region that doesn't fit at all</v>

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.740
<v Speaker 2>in this category.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

10
00:00:35.801 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 2>Divya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we all talking about the basket country,</v>

11
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 2>also known as a use Katie along with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevada.</v>

12
00:00:41.011 --> 00:00:45.000
<v Speaker 2>These are two of the richest stands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most prosperous regions in the entire of</v>

13
00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:45.834
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>both of the Basque country and the Vara </v>

14
00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.670
<v Speaker 2>usually at the top of every indicator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far above,</v>

15
00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:52.050
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Catalonia.</v>

16
00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:53.003
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could say that these two regions are </v>

17
00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:56.543
<v Speaker 2>something like a small Germany within </v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain with an entirely different </v>

18
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 2>political systems to the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country as a business sector,</v>

19
00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.810
<v Speaker 2>more typical of northern Europe than </v>
<v Speaker 2>southern Europe.</v>

20
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.230
<v Speaker 2>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this area has it's own language.</v>

21
00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.093
<v Speaker 2>This is called a will scatter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike castle on a hill scatter sounds </v>

22
00:01:17.041 --> 00:01:21.150
<v Speaker 2>nothing like casper and,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is not all like a catalonia.</v>

23
00:01:21.151 --> 00:01:21.984
<v Speaker 2>The Basque country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also has an important separatist </v>

24
00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:25.170
<v Speaker 2>movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

25
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:29.100
<v Speaker 2>10 years before castle and politicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>began to demand independence,</v>

26
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.280
<v Speaker 2>the basket governments had also tried to</v>
<v Speaker 2>become a sovereign state.</v>

27
00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 2>This was known as the [inaudible] j </v>
<v Speaker 2>plan.</v>

28
00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:35.153
<v Speaker 2>See the then president of the basket </v>
<v Speaker 2>country borders is officially called to </v>

29
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.533
<v Speaker 2>the basket of [inaudible] Juan Jose </v>
<v Speaker 2>about [inaudible] tried to divorce from </v>

30
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.074
<v Speaker 2>Spain and they went pretty badly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of that is something we are going </v>

31
00:01:46.501 --> 00:01:47.850
<v Speaker 2>to address in a whole of the video.</v>

32
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.400
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

33
00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.233
<v Speaker 2>let's get onto today's question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's why is the best country and </v>

34
00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:59.380
<v Speaker 2>Novari richer than the rest of Spain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why do we say that they have a different</v>

35
00:01:59.381 --> 00:02:01.090
<v Speaker 2>political systems the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>

36
00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.983
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we are going to answer all of those </v>

37
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:04.330
<v Speaker 2>questions today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>

38
00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.420
<v Speaker 2>let's dive into the history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll heritage both regions.</v>

39
00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:10.754
<v Speaker 2>The Basque Country End Avara have a </v>
<v Speaker 2>special status called the Basque </v>

40
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:14.743
<v Speaker 2>economic agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Any people think that this special </v>

41
00:02:16.911 --> 00:02:17.744
<v Speaker 2>status came from the Middle Ages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that it did see in the </v>

42
00:02:23.591 --> 00:02:24.424
<v Speaker 2>year 1200 the ancient kingdom of Novari </v>
<v Speaker 2>what are now known as the are larva is </v>

43
00:02:28.331 --> 00:02:33.331
<v Speaker 2>Kaia and geepers Korea provinces and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevara itself joins the castiel crown as</v>

44
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:34.504
<v Speaker 2>a condition for this union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The castilian king had to recognize </v>

45
00:02:36.821 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 2>these circles and never reason Queiroz </v>
<v Speaker 2>or laws.</v>

46
00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:42.763
<v Speaker 2>That is to say that this kingdom would </v>
<v Speaker 2>maintain an independent government with </v>

47
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:47.660
<v Speaker 2>its own laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own courts,</v>

48
00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.790
<v Speaker 2>and did sent taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

49
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.390
<v Speaker 2>no Novaris citizen could be forced to do</v>
<v Speaker 2>military service.</v>

50
00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.710
<v Speaker 2>These novaris laws remained practically </v>
<v Speaker 2>unchanged for centuries,</v>

51
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:58.573
<v Speaker 2>but don't think that this is an anomaly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every feudal law absolutest political </v>

52
00:03:02.321 --> 00:03:03.730
<v Speaker 2>system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>be it in Spain,</v>

53
00:03:03.731 --> 00:03:04.564
<v Speaker 2>France or the United Kingdom was full of</v>
<v Speaker 2>regions with special rights and special </v>

54
00:03:08.441 --> 00:03:09.580
<v Speaker 2>laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

55
00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.760
<v Speaker 2>things changed in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At that time,</v>

56
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:13.623
<v Speaker 2>Spain was consolidated as a modern state</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then decided to innovate the model </v>

57
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:20.650
<v Speaker 2>of Napoleon's France.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is a centrist</v>

58
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:21.573
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

59
00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.023
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that almost every law would </v>

60
00:03:25.811 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 2>be dictated from the capsule and would </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply equally throughout the territory.</v>

61
00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.920
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this did not please the Novari's and the</v>

62
00:03:32.921 --> 00:03:37.030
<v Speaker 2>Basque citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly that's paying more taxes and do</v>

63
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.030
<v Speaker 2>compulsory military service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not a great combination.</v>

64
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:42.430
<v Speaker 2>There's explains why during the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 2>century,</v>

65
00:03:42.431 --> 00:03:44.230
<v Speaker 2>Spain had not one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not two,</v>

66
00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:45.123
<v Speaker 2>but three civil wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were the so called car list was </v>

67
00:03:49.121 --> 00:03:49.954
<v Speaker 2>where the old regime supporters mainly </v>
<v Speaker 2>basques and Novaris fought against the </v>

68
00:03:53.651 --> 00:03:54.484
<v Speaker 2>Spanish army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then in 1876 when these novaris basket </v>

69
00:03:57.061 --> 00:04:00.100
<v Speaker 2>trips where if he did the laws </v>
<v Speaker 2>abolished,</v>

70
00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.510
<v Speaker 2>suddenly these four provinces have to </v>
<v Speaker 2>follow the laws that came from the dread</v>

71
00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.193
<v Speaker 2>and in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to pay a percentage of their </v>

72
00:04:09.421 --> 00:04:10.254
<v Speaker 2>taxes to the central states and Roseanne</v>
<v Speaker 2>Madrid's allowed them to retain a </v>

73
00:04:13.261 --> 00:04:14.094
<v Speaker 2>special fiscal status.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this concession is what we call the </v>

74
00:04:17.341 --> 00:04:19.950
<v Speaker 2>Basque agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which as you can see,</v>

75
00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.853
<v Speaker 2>wasn't born in the middle ages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it was approved in exchange for </v>

76
00:04:23.701 --> 00:04:25.980
<v Speaker 2>abolishing of the laws.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it doesn't end there.</v>

77
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.303
<v Speaker 2>Decades later in 1939 Franco's </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship eliminated this economic </v>

78
00:04:33.541 --> 00:04:34.374
<v Speaker 2>agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but only in the two provinces that </v>

79
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:39.180
<v Speaker 2>didn't support him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We boost Koa and Vizcaya.</v>

80
00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.273
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can already see from all of this </v>

81
00:04:40.901 --> 00:04:44.910
<v Speaker 2>is around the torture of story with wars</v>
<v Speaker 2>and demands from both sides,</v>

82
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:45.773
<v Speaker 2>both provinces,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which lost their special fiscal </v>

83
00:04:47.071 --> 00:04:47.904
<v Speaker 2>conditions where especially hers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this can be seen today where a huge </v>

84
00:04:50.911 --> 00:04:51.744
<v Speaker 2>percentage of Bisco lions and Quepos </v>
<v Speaker 2>Koans wants independence from Spain and </v>

85
00:04:55.411 --> 00:04:56.244
<v Speaker 2>all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This explains why in the 1970s the new </v>

86
00:04:57.511 --> 00:04:58.344
<v Speaker 2>democratic Spanish constitutions writers</v>
<v Speaker 2>it to compensate bask and Navarro the </v>

87
00:05:02.161 --> 00:05:06.570
<v Speaker 2>Basque agreements resends but this time </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a modernized version,</v>

88
00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.410
<v Speaker 2>the Basque quota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the most confusing issues</v>

89
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:15.900
<v Speaker 2>in Spanish politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

90
00:05:15.901 --> 00:05:17.870
<v Speaker 2>if a citizen lives in Malaga Raw,</v>
<v Speaker 2>valid,</v>

91
00:05:17.871 --> 00:05:18.704
<v Speaker 2>the lid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he or she pays most of their taxes </v>

92
00:05:20.261 --> 00:05:22.570
<v Speaker 2>directly to the central governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

93
00:05:22.571 --> 00:05:23.404
<v Speaker 2>there are some special taxes that </v>
<v Speaker 2>depends on the city or the autonomous </v>

94
00:05:26.501 --> 00:05:27.334
<v Speaker 2>community.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the vast majority goes to the </v>

95
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:31.293
<v Speaker 2>National Treasury afterwards,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the state distributes this money among </v>

96
00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.780
<v Speaker 2>the different autonomous governments as </v>
<v Speaker 2>they see fit.</v>

97
00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.753
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

98
00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:44.200
<v Speaker 2>these are the so called autonomic </v>
<v Speaker 2>transfers.</v>

99
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.123
<v Speaker 2>And of course some regions tend to </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits from these transverse and </v>

100
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.860
<v Speaker 2>others are harmed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In theory,</v>

101
00:05:50.861 --> 00:05:51.694
<v Speaker 2>and this is quite debatable,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the richer regions help the poorer </v>

102
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 2>regions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

103
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.780
<v Speaker 2>both Navarro ans the Basque country have</v>
<v Speaker 2>a different system.</v>

104
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:00.883
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the provincial governments collect </v>

105
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 2>almost all of the taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And notice it that I said provincial.</v>

106
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.710
<v Speaker 2>This means that if a citizen lives,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

107
00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:10.544
<v Speaker 2>in Bilbao,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not pay taxes to the Basque </v>

108
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but to the Vizcaya provincial council,</v>

109
00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.510
<v Speaker 2>and this provincial governments has the </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomy to do things like this.</v>

110
00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.980
<v Speaker 2>This KAIA will change taxes on company </v>
<v Speaker 2>profits to increase competitiveness.</v>

111
00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 2>So maybe you remember in another video </v>
<v Speaker 2>we told you why Switzerland is so rich.</v>

112
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.173
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the reasons for this is that in </v>

113
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.704
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each cans on it can compete with each </v>

114
00:06:36.941 --> 00:06:39.550
<v Speaker 2>other by offering better fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 2>conditions.</v>

115
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>something similar is happening in the </v>

116
00:06:41.291 --> 00:06:42.124
<v Speaker 2>basket and the Var provinces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that explains why it taxation in </v>

117
00:06:44.741 --> 00:06:47.950
<v Speaker 2>these regions is a little lower than it </v>
<v Speaker 2>is in the rest of Spain.</v>

118
00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You may be wondering,</v>

119
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:53.080
<v Speaker 2>do these provincial councils pay nothing</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the Spanish state?</v>

120
00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:53.771
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

121
00:06:53.771 --> 00:06:54.604
<v Speaker 2>there's none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So that's where the so called basket </v>

122
00:06:55.931 --> 00:07:00.070
<v Speaker 2>quarter comes into play.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Basque quota is the percentage these</v>

123
00:07:00.071 --> 00:07:00.904
<v Speaker 2>regions pay to the central government in</v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange for the common services they </v>

124
00:07:04.211 --> 00:07:05.170
<v Speaker 2>enjoy for belonging.</v>

125
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.473
<v Speaker 1>Thanks.</v>

126
00:07:09.270 --> 00:07:12.270
<v Speaker 2>Sample the army,</v>
<v Speaker 2>embassies and roads.</v>

127
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:16.440
<v Speaker 2>All these are paid by Madrid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the basques can also enjoy them.</v>

128
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.260
<v Speaker 2>They therefore I have to pay part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>cost.</v>

129
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:21.030
<v Speaker 2>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if for example,</v>

130
00:07:21.031 --> 00:07:23.190
<v Speaker 2>Spain decided to increase the defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>budget,</v>

131
00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.400
<v Speaker 2>the basket quarter would also grow </v>
<v Speaker 2>proportionally.</v>

132
00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.730
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this is the irascible.</v>

133
00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.550
<v Speaker 2>The truth isn't the basket quota is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>result of political negotiations.</v>

134
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:34.770
<v Speaker 2>That's a different story for a different</v>
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>

135
00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.663
<v Speaker 2>The truth is those,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike all the other autonomous </v>

136
00:07:37.531 --> 00:07:38.364
<v Speaker 2>communities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Basque country and Nevara know </v>

137
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.820
<v Speaker 2>exactly how much money they pay for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>common cause and how much remains,</v>

138
00:07:44.821 --> 00:07:47.430
<v Speaker 2>and in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a fantastic advantage.</v>

139
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:50.790
<v Speaker 2>But just wait a moment because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't end.</v>

140
00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In principal,</v>

141
00:07:55.340 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 2>it might seem that the economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements is a fair system.</v>

142
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:01.520
<v Speaker 2>Everything in the negotiation is black </v>
<v Speaker 2>and white,</v>

143
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that the system is far </v>
<v Speaker 2>from perfect.</v>

144
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when I said that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>central state distributes the money that</v>

145
00:08:07.501 --> 00:08:09.980
<v Speaker 2>it collects among the different </v>
<v Speaker 2>autonomous communities?</v>

146
00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:10.843
<v Speaker 2>While the truth is that both Nevara ans </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Basque country belong to this </v>

147
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 2>distribution and it's being such rich </v>
<v Speaker 2>regions,</v>

148
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:21.200
<v Speaker 2>it would be logical to think that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>would contribute more than they receive.</v>

149
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.540
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is totally not happening.</v>

150
00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:26.780
<v Speaker 1>Basque</v>

151
00:08:26.780 --> 00:08:30.890
<v Speaker 2>country receives twice as many resources</v>
<v Speaker 2>per capita as Madrid,</v>

152
00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:33.320
<v Speaker 2>Catalonia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Andalusia and say,</v>

153
00:08:33.321 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 2>now you maybe asking yourself this and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that as well.</v>

154
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:38.720
<v Speaker 2>How is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason why it's purely political,</v>

155
00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:39.673
<v Speaker 2>as I was saying,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basket nationalism is as important as </v>

156
00:08:42.621 --> 00:08:43.880
<v Speaker 2>Kassala national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it?</v>

157
00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:44.923
<v Speaker 2>That means there's these autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 2>communities have their own political </v>

158
00:08:47.901 --> 00:08:48.734
<v Speaker 2>parties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parties such as the Basque Nationalist </v>

159
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Party,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which holds its communities,</v>

160
00:08:52.521 --> 00:08:53.354
<v Speaker 2>governments and has a strong </v>
<v Speaker 2>representation and the national </v>

161
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:57.030
<v Speaker 2>parliaments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

162
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:57.923
<v Speaker 2>every year the central government has to</v>
<v Speaker 2>approve national budgets in parliaments </v>

163
00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:02.393
<v Speaker 2>for that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they need an absolute majority and </v>

164
00:09:04.101 --> 00:09:08.340
<v Speaker 2>majority that's in most cases requires </v>
<v Speaker 2>support from these parties.</v>

165
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:09.353
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't the only reason for the </v>

166
00:09:10.471 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 2>Basque country's prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

167
00:09:12.751 --> 00:09:13.584
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's much more at play here and look </v>

168
00:09:16.471 --> 00:09:17.304
<v Speaker 2>into it right now.</v>

169
00:09:20.650 --> 00:09:21.483
<v Speaker 2>Germany and Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you heard of a company called </v>

170
00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:23.921
<v Speaker 2>Audley?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

171
00:09:23.921 --> 00:09:27.310
<v Speaker 2>if you have a gas stove,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might own some of their products.</v>

172
00:09:27.370 --> 00:09:31.780
<v Speaker 2>It's the world leader in manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 2>systems for preventing accidents and gas</v>

173
00:09:31.781 --> 00:09:32.614
<v Speaker 2>leaks and their headquarters are in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order Zia a town in the gift this Koa </v>

174
00:09:35.141 --> 00:09:35.974
<v Speaker 2>province.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for j m a if you have an </v>

175
00:09:38.081 --> 00:09:38.914
<v Speaker 2>armored door in your house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's highly likely that both the lock </v>

176
00:09:41.170 --> 00:09:43.960
<v Speaker 2>and the keys have been manufactured by </v>
<v Speaker 2>this company,</v>

177
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:48.010
<v Speaker 2>which is located in drag on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a small Basque town.</v>

178
00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:53.310
<v Speaker 2>These are the so called hidden leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are small,</v>

179
00:09:55.041 --> 00:09:55.874
<v Speaker 2>hyper specialized companies that have </v>
<v Speaker 2>become benchmarks in their niche and </v>

180
00:09:58.641 --> 00:10:01.220
<v Speaker 2>which have devastated the international </v>
<v Speaker 2>markets.</v>

181
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:02.143
<v Speaker 2>In a previous video we told you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have Germany o's part of its wealth </v>

182
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.050
<v Speaker 2>to Middle Astons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

183
00:10:06.051 --> 00:10:08.150
<v Speaker 2>the Basque economic model is very </v>
<v Speaker 2>similar.</v>

184
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:10.520
<v Speaker 2>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have the opportunity to travel by</v>

185
00:10:10.521 --> 00:10:11.354
<v Speaker 2>road through IES Katie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see factories disbursed </v>

186
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.650
<v Speaker 2>throughout its landscape.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

187
00:10:15.770 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 2>it's population is much more scattered </v>
<v Speaker 2>than anywhere else in Spain.</v>

188
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are large cities,</v>

189
00:10:22.070 --> 00:10:25.480
<v Speaker 2>but most people live in urban centers </v>
<v Speaker 2>have less than 40,000 inhabitants.</v>

190
00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:30.643
<v Speaker 2>These municipalities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>business hubs then employ locals in the </v>

191
00:10:33.711 --> 00:10:34.544
<v Speaker 2>Basque country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economic activity isn't only </v>

192
00:10:36.711 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 2>concentrated in large cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I,</v>

193
00:10:38.671 --> 00:10:39.740
<v Speaker 2>you may ask yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

194
00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:43.700
<v Speaker 2>why does [inaudible] have such a </v>
<v Speaker 2>homogenous business network for this?</v>

195
00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:46.260
<v Speaker 2>We resent to the same principle at </v>
<v Speaker 2>knots,</v>

196
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:47.113
<v Speaker 2>decentralization by having four </v>
<v Speaker 2>different treasuries with autonomy to </v>

197
00:10:49.851 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 2>collects taxes and make investments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a higher tax competition than in</v>

198
00:10:54.410 --> 00:10:55.243
<v Speaker 2>any other parts of Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that public investments arms </v>

199
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:01.910
<v Speaker 2>concentrated in a specific place,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but are distributed evenly.</v>

200
00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:09.760
<v Speaker 2>Investing in startups will have a 30% </v>
<v Speaker 2>deduction in GIB boosie core.</v>

201
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.260
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's true,</v>

202
00:11:11.290 --> 00:11:12.123
<v Speaker 2>both the basques ans the Novari is have </v>
<v Speaker 2>a huge advantage because they receive </v>

203
00:11:16.061 --> 00:11:16.894
<v Speaker 2>money from the central states,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that money has been invested much </v>

204
00:11:19.781 --> 00:11:22.150
<v Speaker 2>more efficiently than in any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>

205
00:11:22.270 --> 00:11:23.103
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>isn't it a coincidence that these two </v>

206
00:11:24.221 --> 00:11:27.730
<v Speaker 2>communities are the least indebted in </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of Spain?</v>

207
00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.673
<v Speaker 2>And that's in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have hardly any of the corruption </v>

208
00:11:30.941 --> 00:11:33.180
<v Speaker 2>cases that have poisoned the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>car</v>

209
00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.113
<v Speaker 1>tree.</v>

210
00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:40.610
<v Speaker 2>So now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think some elements of the basket</v>

211
00:11:40.611 --> 00:11:44.450
<v Speaker 2>Novari's models could be rescued and </v>
<v Speaker 2>replicated in other countries?</v>

212
00:11:44.451 --> 00:11:45.284
<v Speaker 2>Do you think it would be possible to </v>
<v Speaker 2>apply the Basque agreements to other </v>

213
00:11:47.721 --> 00:11:48.531
<v Speaker 2>regions?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

214
00:11:48.531 --> 00:11:51.470
<v Speaker 2>let us know in the comments section </v>
