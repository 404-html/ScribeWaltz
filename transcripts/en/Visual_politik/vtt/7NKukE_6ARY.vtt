1
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>It's known as the lucky</v>

2
00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.023
<v Speaker 2>train,</v>

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.330
<v Speaker 1>amazing beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great deal of natural life spans,</v>

4
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many natural resources.</v>

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>This is Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a surface paradise,</v>

6
00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>and they send it to the sport of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cricket.</v>

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:27.053
<v Speaker 1>For those who are unaware,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a British sport where there is </v>

8
00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:29.554
<v Speaker 1>even a break for tea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is give us something special </v>

9
00:00:32.361 --> 00:00:34.990
<v Speaker 1>and unique country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighty percent of its plants and animals</v>

10
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.833
<v Speaker 1>don't exist anywhere else on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything is so different in Australia </v>

11
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.870
<v Speaker 1>compared to the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but even its characteristic animal,</v>

12
00:00:41.871 --> 00:00:45.650
<v Speaker 1>the national symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't even run or even fly.</v>

13
00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.773
<v Speaker 1>It jumped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a natural environment is </v>

14
00:00:53.631 --> 00:00:57.500
<v Speaker 1>not only unique,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also rather terrifying.</v>

15
00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.460
<v Speaker 1>Australia has more deadly things than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any other place in the wells.</v>

16
00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:01.294
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the 10 most poisonous snakes in </v>

17
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:05.870
<v Speaker 1>the weld off from Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not enough evidence for you.</v>

18
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:06.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about some other examples of the </v>

19
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:12.410
<v Speaker 1>deadly Australian ecosystem and have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at these four animals,</v>

20
00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:15.850
<v Speaker 3>the funnel web,</v>
<v Speaker 3>spider box jellyfish,</v>

21
00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.700
<v Speaker 3>the blue ringed octopus and the stone </v>
<v Speaker 3>fish.</v>

22
00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.640
<v Speaker 3>They're all in Australia and they're the</v>
<v Speaker 3>deadliest of their kind.</v>

23
00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.770
<v Speaker 1>Just be careful because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

24
00:01:24.771 --> 00:01:25.850
<v Speaker 1>there's much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more</v>

25
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.810
<v Speaker 3>crocodiles that weighed more than 1500 </v>
<v Speaker 3>kilograms sharks of all kinds and sizes,</v>

26
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.990
<v Speaker 3>and if animals don't scare you enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>don't feel safe.</v>

27
00:01:35.991 --> 00:01:40.640
<v Speaker 3>Yet there were many more natural dangers</v>
<v Speaker 3>of all kinds because this is a dry,</v>

28
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 3>hot and aggressive climate.</v>

29
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.063
<v Speaker 1>How would that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>None of these things have stopped </v>

30
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:47.470
<v Speaker 1>Australia in any way from becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dream,</v>

31
00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:49.830
<v Speaker 1>the millions of people who dream of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better future.</v>

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.113
<v Speaker 1>It's certainly logical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean take a look at some of the </v>

33
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.660
<v Speaker 1>incredible places we can find in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

34
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.780
<v Speaker 1>This is the gold coast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

35
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:03.643
<v Speaker 1>we are not only referring to regular </v>
<v Speaker 1>folks here who are heading to Australia </v>

36
00:02:06.131 --> 00:02:08.050
<v Speaker 1>for a brighter future in the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

37
00:02:08.051 --> 00:02:11.110
<v Speaker 1>Australia has been like a magnet for </v>
<v Speaker 1>millionaires as well,</v>

38
00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 1>but the big question is why to find out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest with that.</v>

39
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.580
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have to leave the animals</v>
<v Speaker 1>aside and talk to some business</v>

40
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.900
<v Speaker 2>Australia.</v>

41
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a magnet for big fortune.</v>

42
00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.250
<v Speaker 1>Everyday it gets easier to move around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

43
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.143
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can reach almost any place in a </v>

44
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.214
<v Speaker 1>quick,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable and affordable way for </v>

45
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.170
<v Speaker 1>further thanks to the Internet and all </v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of new communication methods.</v>

46
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.093
<v Speaker 1>You can run a business from wherever you</v>
<v Speaker 1>want and just look at how things have </v>

47
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:40.100
<v Speaker 1>changed</v>

48
00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.300
<v Speaker 3>just 50 years ago for a trip between </v>
<v Speaker 3>London and Sydney.</v>

49
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 3>We have to make many stops on the way </v>
<v Speaker 3>and it never took less than three days.</v>

50
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.143
<v Speaker 3>Same trip can now be done in much less </v>
<v Speaker 3>time and a bit more than 20 hours on a </v>

51
00:02:56.461 --> 00:03:00.250
<v Speaker 3>comfortable plain,</v>
<v Speaker 3>safe and with various films,</v>

52
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 3>TV series and music.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You can arrive</v>

53
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:07.730
<v Speaker 1>because of this increase in the ease of </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling communications,</v>

54
00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.210
<v Speaker 1>wealthy business people have become more</v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding of their country,</v>

55
00:03:11.211 --> 00:03:12.380
<v Speaker 1>of residence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

56
00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.243
<v Speaker 1>they can now easily choose where they </v>
<v Speaker 1>prefer to live without it affecting </v>

57
00:03:16.101 --> 00:03:16.934
<v Speaker 1>their business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only attractive taxes that </v>

58
00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:21.290
<v Speaker 1>affect the choice of where a wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>person lives.</v>

59
00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.680
<v Speaker 1>They also want to live in places with </v>
<v Speaker 1>high standards of living where it's easy</v>

60
00:03:24.681 --> 00:03:25.514
<v Speaker 1>to do business and whether a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools as well as safety in terms of </v>

61
00:03:27.951 --> 00:03:30.440
<v Speaker 1>both physical security as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>judicial safety.</v>

62
00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.600
<v Speaker 1>The last meaning they can leave their </v>
<v Speaker 1>savings safely,</v>

63
00:03:32.601 --> 00:03:33.434
<v Speaker 1>deposited somewhere safe in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge that it won't be seized by a </v>

64
00:03:35.421 --> 00:03:37.430
<v Speaker 1>corrupt politician or they've had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>argument,</v>

65
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.153
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

66
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.673
<v Speaker 3>64 percent of Chinese millionaires have </v>
<v Speaker 3>either immigrated or plan to immigrate </v>

67
00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.620
<v Speaker 3>taking their spending and their fortunes</v>
<v Speaker 3>with them</v>

68
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 1>and Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealth.</v>

69
00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.320
<v Speaker 1>It has a lot to offer these </v>
<v Speaker 1>millionaires.</v>

70
00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:55.260
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the fifth most free economy in the</v>

71
00:03:55.261 --> 00:03:57.630
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is very easy to do business that I'm.</v>

72
00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.180
<v Speaker 1>There are plenty of opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

73
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:01.043
<v Speaker 1>The justice system also works incredibly</v>
<v Speaker 1>well and it has a very competitive </v>

74
00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:07.290
<v Speaker 1>financial system and regulations as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>general rule.</v>

75
00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.103
<v Speaker 1>Plus on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the countries with the </v>

76
00:04:12.641 --> 00:04:13.474
<v Speaker 1>highest standard of living in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>because there are a huge number of </v>

77
00:04:16.781 --> 00:04:19.160
<v Speaker 1>quality services like hospitals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universities,</v>

78
00:04:19.161 --> 00:04:19.510
<v Speaker 1>and</v>

79
00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.343
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

80
00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:22.240
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>

81
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:23.083
<v Speaker 1>Australia's big cities maintain the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highest positions in the international </v>

82
00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:29.260
<v Speaker 1>rankings in terms of quality of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>

83
00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:30.123
<v Speaker 1>Melbourne for six years in a row now has</v>
<v Speaker 1>led the quality of life rankings as </v>

84
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:37.150
<v Speaker 1>compiled by the economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means it must be a pretty wonderful</v>

85
00:04:37.151 --> 00:04:37.984
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

86
00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.510
<v Speaker 2>I'm sweating.</v>

87
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:43.543
<v Speaker 1>That wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country recently created an open </v>

88
00:04:45.371 --> 00:04:48.110
<v Speaker 1>door projects for people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant fortunes</v>

89
00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.253
<v Speaker 3>in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Millionaires willing to invest about </v>

90
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:52.044
<v Speaker 3>three point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 3>million US dollars can obtain a </v>

91
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:56.490
<v Speaker 3>permanent residence card and if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>fall a little bit short,</v>

92
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:57.324
<v Speaker 3>if this three point $5,000,000 figure,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they can still get a lot of advantages </v>

93
00:05:00.301 --> 00:05:02.190
<v Speaker 3>with $750,000.</v>

94
00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.640
<v Speaker 2>Great</v>

95
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.280
<v Speaker 1>standards of living,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ease of doing business and open doors.</v>

96
00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.470
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the results of all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been?</v>

97
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty interesting.</v>

98
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.043
<v Speaker 1>In both 2015 and 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia has been the country whether </v>

99
00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.813
<v Speaker 1>most millionaires have moved to beating </v>
<v Speaker 1>out even the United States in 2006 in </v>

100
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.170
<v Speaker 1>particular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$11,000 million as moved to Australia,</v>

101
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>which is an unbelievable figure for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country whose population is less than 25</v>

102
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:29.123
<v Speaker 1>million and honestly that might be the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best indicator of the unstoppable </v>

103
00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:32.973
<v Speaker 1>Australian</v>

104
00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.893
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

105
00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.560
<v Speaker 3>Best version of the United States.</v>

106
00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:41.643
<v Speaker 1>When you arrived in Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some say that they feel they've arrived </v>

107
00:05:44.111 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>and an improved version of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

108
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.433
<v Speaker 1>That is to say in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city's system and society in both </v>

109
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:51.560
<v Speaker 1>countries is quite similar.</v>

110
00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.190
<v Speaker 3>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>even as its own Washington DC,</v>

111
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 3>a capital city built for and by the </v>
<v Speaker 3>politically powerful.</v>

112
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:03.920
<v Speaker 3>Now some might forget,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but the capital city of Australia is not</v>

113
00:06:03.921 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 3>Sydney or Melbourne.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's Canberra,</v>

114
00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:06.803
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

115
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:09.763
<v Speaker 1>The truth is you could mistake Australia</v>
<v Speaker 1>for America at first if it wasn't for </v>

116
00:06:12.591 --> 00:06:13.424
<v Speaker 1>the fact that cars are on the wrong side</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the roads and there are statues of </v>

117
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Queen Victoria decorating the cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an interesting aside,</v>

118
00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:20.123
<v Speaker 1>it Australia is still technically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy and it's queen this Queen </v>

119
00:06:23.350 --> 00:06:28.350
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth Second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:06:29.881 --> 00:06:32.190
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that besides all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities,</v>

121
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.230
<v Speaker 1>Australia is a safer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cleaner,</v>

122
00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:35.970
<v Speaker 1>more modern,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more cosmopolitan,</v>

123
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.013
<v Speaker 1>more prosperous country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Australians are also richer than </v>

124
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:40.404
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

125
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.680
<v Speaker 3>When Australians visit the US,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they see a country in decline.</v>

126
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 3>Australian see the bad airports,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the infrastructure,</v>

127
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:47.900
<v Speaker 3>the poor,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the becker.</v>

128
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.893
<v Speaker 1>Now maybe you can understand why people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think Australia is something of an </v>

129
00:06:53.541 --> 00:06:56.030
<v Speaker 1>improved USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>

130
00:06:56.031 --> 00:06:58.970
<v Speaker 1>international media doesn't pay a ton of</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to Australia,</v>

131
00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.833
<v Speaker 1>but this really shouldn't be the case </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is a country that hasn't </v>

132
00:07:02.421 --> 00:07:05.900
<v Speaker 1>seen an economic crisis in 26 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

133
00:07:05.901 --> 00:07:07.610
<v Speaker 1>the last time the country went through a</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

134
00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 1>Gorbachev was in power in the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

135
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:10.993
<v Speaker 1>No battery.</v>

136
00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.093
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the phone that he had always thought of </v>

137
00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:15.293
<v Speaker 4>you.</v>

138
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:19.320
<v Speaker 1>No financial crisis like crisis over raw</v>
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>

139
00:07:19.321 --> 00:07:22.710
<v Speaker 1>No unemployment's seemingly no problems </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all in Australia.</v>

140
00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:23.663
<v Speaker 1>And so the question is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the result of all of this </v>

141
00:07:26.041 --> 00:07:29.580
<v Speaker 1>prosperity with a population of just 24 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants,</v>

142
00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:34.610
<v Speaker 1>it's economy is already as big as Russia</v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

143
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:37.383
<v Speaker 1>It is also important to note that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is very dependent on its raw </v>

144
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:40.984
<v Speaker 1>materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make up more than half of its </v>

145
00:07:42.161 --> 00:07:42.994
<v Speaker 1>exports.</v>

146
00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.373
<v Speaker 3>20 19.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Australia will replace gutter as the </v>

147
00:07:46.451 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 3>world's leading natural gas export.</v>

148
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:51.420
<v Speaker 1>So when the prices of raw material </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to fall,</v>

149
00:07:51.421 --> 00:07:52.254
<v Speaker 1>it seems there's Australia would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing a situation similar to those </v>

150
00:07:54.631 --> 00:07:55.980
<v Speaker 1>which occurred in Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

151
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:57.210
<v Speaker 1>Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

152
00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.053
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seemed as if the good times were </v>

153
00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:02.550
<v Speaker 1>about to come to an end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality,</v>

154
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:04.920
<v Speaker 1>the reality is entirely different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Australia,</v>

155
00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:07.890
<v Speaker 1>unlike almost every other producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation,</v>

156
00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.890
<v Speaker 1>the crisis in raw materials didn't cause</v>
<v Speaker 1>any harm.</v>

157
00:08:10.920 --> 00:08:11.753
<v Speaker 1>So what is it that makes Australia </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost invulnerable to any kinds of </v>

158
00:08:14.971 --> 00:08:16.050
<v Speaker 1>crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

159
00:08:16.140 --> 00:08:16.973
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look.</v>

160
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:20.770
<v Speaker 3>The secret of success.</v>

161
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.510
<v Speaker 2>Lazy.</v>

162
00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:26.120
<v Speaker 1>I regularly follow visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You already know that.</v>

163
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>We like to say good policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good results,</v>

164
00:08:28.830 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 1>but that is exactly what Australia has </v>
<v Speaker 1>done in the last few decades.</v>

165
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>They've had reformance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The changes weren't many,</v>

166
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:38.180
<v Speaker 1>so we'll just mention some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important ones.</v>

167
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:40.160
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government decided to battle opening</v>

168
00:08:40.161 --> 00:08:41.990
<v Speaker 1>up the economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>International Trade,</v>

169
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>removing most terrorists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country is today,</v>

170
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:46.790
<v Speaker 1>a from defender of free trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements.</v>

171
00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:53.840
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seconds</v>

172
00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.910
<v Speaker 1>in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Labor is of poor.</v>

173
00:08:55.920 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>Keating decided to start a retirement </v>
<v Speaker 1>system known as super annuation based on</v>

174
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:01.404
<v Speaker 1>capitalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so each worker saves and invest a part </v>

175
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:05.940
<v Speaker 1>of their salary to pay for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>retirements.</v>

176
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:06.803
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Australian system is similar to the </v>

177
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:11.940
<v Speaker 1>one in Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The results are absolutely outstanding.</v>

178
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:12.803
<v Speaker 1>The program has allowed people to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate large quantities of savings </v>

179
00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:17.820
<v Speaker 1>which have been invested in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>productive economy.</v>

180
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Besides all this money saved has </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched the finance industry.</v>

181
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.073
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is already one of the most </v>

182
00:09:23.311 --> 00:09:28.311
<v Speaker 1>important markets for investment funds </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it isn't just that Australia has the</v>

183
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.290
<v Speaker 1>world's highest growth rate for finance </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

184
00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:32.213
<v Speaker 1>Third in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started the national competition </v>

185
00:09:34.441 --> 00:09:35.274
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the aim of which was to reduce state </v>

186
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:40.350
<v Speaker 1>interventionism in many sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This program allowed for the elimination</v>

187
00:09:40.351 --> 00:09:44.670
<v Speaker 1>of almost 20,000 rules and regulations </v>
<v Speaker 1>which restricted competition.</v>

188
00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:45.533
<v Speaker 1>Also an ambitious program for </v>
<v Speaker 1>privatization and the elimination of </v>

189
00:09:48.031 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>state monopolies was launched and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to know an example from this.</v>

190
00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:52.320
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be quantified</v>

191
00:09:52.570 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 5>today.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You're flying on a quad bike.</v>

192
00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.383
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

193
00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.470
<v Speaker 1>and three big major changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As in addition to that,</v>

194
00:10:07.471 --> 00:10:10.280
<v Speaker 1>we also have budget stability in labor </v>
<v Speaker 1>flexibility.</v>

195
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.153
<v Speaker 1>Then so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what has been the result of all </v>

196
00:10:14.341 --> 00:10:15.180
<v Speaker 1>of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:16.043
<v Speaker 1>that's 25 years without a recession and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy with no unemployment as an </v>

198
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>average salary of more than $5,000 a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

199
00:10:22.470 --> 00:10:25.620
<v Speaker 1>And that's not even mentioning the tons </v>
<v Speaker 1>of foreign investment.</v>

200
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:27.120
<v Speaker 1>Sounds pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

201
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:28.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did visual politic.</v>

202
00:10:28.350 --> 00:10:29.183
<v Speaker 1>We will draw the conclusion that it is </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong for a country to blame the price </v>

203
00:10:31.771 --> 00:10:35.880
<v Speaker 1>of raw materials for a financial crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply didn't do their homework.</v>

204
00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>And do you know who did do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Home work?</v>

205
00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:38.041
<v Speaker 1>Wellbe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

206
00:10:38.041 --> 00:10:40.080
<v Speaker 1>that's Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think?</v>

207
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Australia is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>destination for the wealthy?</v>

208
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the country could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the 21st century?</v>

209
