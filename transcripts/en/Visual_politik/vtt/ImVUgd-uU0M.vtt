1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.120
<v Speaker 1>That is video is going to be a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>special.</v>

2
00:00:03.121 --> 00:00:03.954
<v Speaker 1>It's a little bit difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not going to be talking about </v>

3
00:00:07.111 --> 00:00:08.610
<v Speaker 1>politics today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:12.210
<v Speaker 1>we actually wanted to tell you a bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about visual policy itself.</v>

5
00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.103
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about this channel </v>

6
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:15.751
<v Speaker 1>because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

7
00:00:15.751 --> 00:00:17.340
<v Speaker 1>we've got some important news to tell </v>
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.533
<v Speaker 1>A few weeks ago we marked the one year </v>
<v Speaker 1>anniversary of this channel and today </v>

9
00:00:30.361 --> 00:00:31.194
<v Speaker 1>we're well on our way to half a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>subscribers as every day 100,000 people </v>

10
00:00:35.011 --> 00:00:35.910
<v Speaker 1>view a video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

11
00:00:35.911 --> 00:00:38.760
<v Speaker 1>whenever you start a new business or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube channel,</v>

12
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.740
<v Speaker 1>there's always some risk attached to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

13
00:00:40.741 --> 00:00:41.574
<v Speaker 1>and honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all at visual politic felt that </v>

14
00:00:43.321 --> 00:00:44.154
<v Speaker 1>starting a political channel on youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was kind of a particularly big risk </v>

15
00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>in forms rather than sensational </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics on any medium,</v>

16
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>especially youtube is not exactly eight </v>
<v Speaker 1>super hot topic.</v>

17
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.480
<v Speaker 1>It's not an exciting blog.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a gaming channel.</v>

18
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:59.880
<v Speaker 1>It's not even top 10 lists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and quite honestly,</v>

19
00:00:59.881 --> 00:01:03.360
<v Speaker 1>while we hoped it would do well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't really expect that the channel</v>

20
00:01:03.361 --> 00:01:05.490
<v Speaker 1>would grow in quite the way that it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>

21
00:01:05.491 --> 00:01:08.010
<v Speaker 1>As many of you might know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not my first channel.</v>

22
00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:08.844
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have three other youtube projects on </v>

23
00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the go right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well now you might be wondering,</v>

24
00:01:13.111 --> 00:01:15.390
<v Speaker 1>well what made me choose to start this </v>
<v Speaker 1>one in particular,</v>

25
00:01:15.391 --> 00:01:16.224
<v Speaker 1>what made me think the visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a good idea and worth all of the </v>

26
00:01:19.111 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>risk?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.810
<v Speaker 1>in this video I want to tell you that </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

28
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.280
<v Speaker 1>Wherever you're watching this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

29
00:01:34.281 --> 00:01:38.660
<v Speaker 1>I am willing to bet there is plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>media coverage about politics.</v>

30
00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.553
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure there are news outlets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>political talk shows of all stripes </v>

31
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.053
<v Speaker 1>satisfying both sides of the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>spectrum and I really don't want to </v>

32
00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:48.584
<v Speaker 1>focus on criticism here because many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these news outlets do trudy outstanding </v>

33
00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:53.384
<v Speaker 1>journalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in general there are a couple of </v>

34
00:01:54.921 --> 00:01:57.710
<v Speaker 1>issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is emotion.</v>

35
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.860
<v Speaker 1>The media playbook on politics as that </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who watch news do save to confirm</v>

36
00:02:03.411 --> 00:02:05.270
<v Speaker 1>their views.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're conservative,</v>

37
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:09.410
<v Speaker 1>you'll watch conservative news and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exact same thing goes if you are liberal</v>

38
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.273
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gary's will tell you that the way you </v>

39
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:17.081
<v Speaker 1>make politics appealing is by showing </v>
<v Speaker 1>emotion and also showing confrontation.</v>

40
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:18.373
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly why it's so many shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>tend to exaggerate their political </v>

41
00:02:21.531 --> 00:02:24.110
<v Speaker 1>positions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It creates a bigger conflicts.</v>

42
00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.420
<v Speaker 1>Now the chances are you already knew </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

43
00:02:26.421 --> 00:02:27.254
<v Speaker 1>but like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a couple of issues here and </v>

44
00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>the second one is one that you might not</v>
<v Speaker 1>be so familiar with.</v>

45
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by definition,</v>

46
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.610
<v Speaker 1>journalists are focused on exceptional </v>
<v Speaker 1>facts.</v>

47
00:02:37.611 --> 00:02:42.611
<v Speaker 1>Consider this aphorism from journalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A dog biting a kid is not newsworthy,</v>

48
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.783
<v Speaker 1>but a kid biting a dog is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has actually been the cornerstone </v>

49
00:02:46.881 --> 00:02:49.640
<v Speaker 1>of political news since what kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>since forever.</v>

50
00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.130
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you a more real world </v>
<v Speaker 1>example here.</v>

51
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.370
<v Speaker 1>Anytime an oil tanker sinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will hit the news on and on.</v>

52
00:02:55.371 --> 00:02:56.204
<v Speaker 1>Go the extensive reports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interviews with experts and all </v>

53
00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>kinds of extended analysis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody's talking about the thousands</v>

54
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>of oil tankers that don't sync all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the thousands that simply make it to </v>

55
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.464
<v Speaker 1>their destination on a schedule and </v>
<v Speaker 1>without problems and display what you </v>

56
00:03:11.681 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>might think from all that media </v>
<v Speaker 1>coverage,</v>

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
<v Speaker 1>those ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that go on those regular </v>

58
00:03:16.061 --> 00:03:18.610
<v Speaker 1>journeys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the ones that have a far bigger</v>

59
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:19.444
<v Speaker 1>impact on your life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I'm willing to bet that the </v>

60
00:03:21.281 --> 00:03:22.114
<v Speaker 1>price of fuel for your car affects you </v>
<v Speaker 1>far more than that last oil tankers </v>

61
00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>sinking off the coast of somewhere.</v>

62
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:28.473
<v Speaker 1>But the reality is that we build our </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception of reality based on those </v>

63
00:03:32.081 --> 00:03:32.914
<v Speaker 1>rare happenings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the normal everyday realities of </v>

64
00:03:35.231 --> 00:03:36.064
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this leads us to not really </v>

65
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:42.040
<v Speaker 1>understand the reality of life at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now let me give you another example.</v>

66
00:03:42.041 --> 00:03:45.550
<v Speaker 1>This one with a bit more of a visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic flavor Africa,</v>

67
00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.580
<v Speaker 1>unless you are a regular visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>view at your mind,</v>

68
00:03:48.581 --> 00:03:52.360
<v Speaker 1>still think of Africa as an entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent full of poverty and misery.</v>

69
00:03:52.361 --> 00:03:53.530
<v Speaker 1>And why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 1>that's because when a journalist talks </v>
<v Speaker 1>about Africa,</v>

71
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>he talks about the exceptional things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a war in Congo,</v>

72
00:03:58.781 --> 00:03:59.614
<v Speaker 1>corruption in Angola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starvation in Somalia and on and on and </v>

73
00:04:02.021 --> 00:04:03.790
<v Speaker 1>on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But economic progress,</v>

74
00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:04.653
<v Speaker 1>it's not some exceptional event.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that ticks along </v>

75
00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:08.950
<v Speaker 1>little by little,</v>
<v Speaker 1>day by day,</v>

76
00:04:08.951 --> 00:04:12.610
<v Speaker 1>never really a big enough story to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>the headlines.</v>

77
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.720
<v Speaker 1>And headlines are what people read </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

78
00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.740
<v Speaker 1>What people have been conditions to care</v>
<v Speaker 1>abouts.</v>

79
00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.050
<v Speaker 1>And it's not just Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just a random example.</v>

80
00:04:20.051 --> 00:04:21.460
<v Speaker 1>It's the whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

81
00:04:21.461 --> 00:04:24.130
<v Speaker 1>Austin man on the street,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the status of the world is today,</v>

82
00:04:24.131 --> 00:04:26.560
<v Speaker 1>and he's probably not going to be full </v>
<v Speaker 1>of optimism.</v>

83
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is war.</v>

84
00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:28.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's poverty,</v>

85
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:29.223
<v Speaker 1>it's corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you know what the dog biting the </v>

86
00:04:30.461 --> 00:04:31.294
<v Speaker 1>kid of this story is?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The oil tanker that arrives safely to </v>

87
00:04:33.281 --> 00:04:34.300
<v Speaker 1>its destination?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:34.301 --> 00:04:38.230
<v Speaker 1>as the simple facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we live in the best time in history,</v>

89
00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:41.080
<v Speaker 1>and this is not an optimistic dreamlike </v>
<v Speaker 1>viewpoint.</v>

90
00:04:41.081 --> 00:04:41.914
<v Speaker 1>It's absolute reality based on facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got the growing middle class in </v>

91
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:46.504
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rick clear path to the elimination of </v>

92
00:04:47.771 --> 00:04:52.000
<v Speaker 1>starvation in Africa and life expectancy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is higher than ever before,</v>

93
00:04:52.001 --> 00:04:53.820
<v Speaker 1>pretty much everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

94
00:04:53.821 --> 00:04:55.720
<v Speaker 1>hope is that if you're watching this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

95
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:58.850
<v Speaker 1>you want a realistic view on the world's</v>
<v Speaker 1>not one salons.</v>

96
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.950
<v Speaker 1>It by popular media desperately needing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show you conflicts and demotion,</v>

97
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:07.090
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't just about giving you an </v>
<v Speaker 1>informed opinion for the sake of it.</v>

98
00:05:07.091 --> 00:05:07.924
<v Speaker 1>It's about giving you an informed </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion because many negative elements </v>

99
00:05:10.601 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>of society take advantage of people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that the world is in trouble.</v>

100
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:17.920
<v Speaker 1>Very little is better than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Polarizing as society.</v>

101
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:18.754
<v Speaker 1>It's stirring up populist movements and </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the micro level even causing us to </v>

102
00:05:21.911 --> 00:05:24.340
<v Speaker 1>make bad decisions in our day to day </v>
<v Speaker 1>lives.</v>

103
00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:26.980
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so far a lot of big talk,</v>

104
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:29.620
<v Speaker 1>but what does visual politic actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to offer you here?</v>

105
00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're here for context.</v>

106
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>We're not competing with traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

107
00:05:32.801 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>We're not trying to get in that 24 hour </v>
<v Speaker 1>news cycle,</v>

108
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.423
<v Speaker 1>and so get me wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's absolutely great to be reading </v>

109
00:05:37.631 --> 00:05:38.464
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and watching TV news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're going to tell you the daily </v>

110
00:05:40.661 --> 00:05:41.494
<v Speaker 1>news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to give you the trends </v>

111
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.730
<v Speaker 1>and the movements that are changing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire worlds.</v>

112
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.623
<v Speaker 1>This is why visual policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd love to compare one country to </v>

113
00:05:48.431 --> 00:05:49.264
<v Speaker 1>another or dive into the history of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in depth before we tell you </v>

114
00:05:52.571 --> 00:05:53.404
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in the present day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Context is so important and it's so </v>

115
00:05:56.051 --> 00:05:56.884
<v Speaker 1>often missed by TV news because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to get the story that is breaking </v>

116
00:06:00.561 --> 00:06:01.394
<v Speaker 1>that very moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the story that's breaking that </v>

117
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.610
<v Speaker 1>hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the story,</v>

118
00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.443
<v Speaker 1>it was breaking that minutes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but most important of all is that we do </v>

119
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:07.664
<v Speaker 1>this while keeping our independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not every media outlet or even youtube </v>

120
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>channel can say this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but visual politic is 100% independent.</v>

121
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:17.240
<v Speaker 1>There's no think tank behind the scenes </v>
<v Speaker 1>writing checks.</v>

122
00:06:17.241 --> 00:06:18.074
<v Speaker 1>This new company providing us with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fancy office and there's no political </v>

123
00:06:20.391 --> 00:06:22.970
<v Speaker 1>party peddling influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no hidden agenda here.</v>

124
00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:23.833
<v Speaker 1>We publish our content in English and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish and we are funded 100% by our </v>

125
00:06:27.531 --> 00:06:28.364
<v Speaker 1>own resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because I know you might be wondering </v>

126
00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>why throughout this video I've talked </v>
<v Speaker 1>about we rather than just I or me.</v>

127
00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:34.670
<v Speaker 1>And that's because as you can probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>

128
00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:35.533
<v Speaker 1>there's a team behind me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a team helping me create the </v>

129
00:06:37.791 --> 00:06:39.890
<v Speaker 1>best content possible here with four </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

130
00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.753
<v Speaker 1>if you include myself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you want to see the other guys </v>

131
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:44.480
<v Speaker 1>behind the team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check the Spanish language channel,</v>

132
00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:46.790
<v Speaker 1>they present all of the videos over </v>
<v Speaker 1>there.</v>

133
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:49.520
<v Speaker 1>And this is not some easy job behind the</v>
<v Speaker 1>scenes of every video here.</v>

134
00:06:49.521 --> 00:06:52.910
<v Speaker 1>This is between 15 hours and 25 hours of</v>
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>

135
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.650
<v Speaker 1>All of our sources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>double checks,</v>

136
00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.100
<v Speaker 1>and we make sure that all of our stories</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet the highest standards.</v>

137
00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.080
<v Speaker 1>Oh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then comes to the actual writing and</v>

138
00:07:00.081 --> 00:07:00.914
<v Speaker 1>the editing and the recording and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and the channel managements </v>

139
00:07:03.981 --> 00:07:06.260
<v Speaker 1>and as well on and on and on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

140
00:07:06.261 --> 00:07:07.094
<v Speaker 1>so at a very visual politic way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me address a few critics very </v>

141
00:07:09.201 --> 00:07:12.020
<v Speaker 1>quickly because there's probably people </v>
<v Speaker 1>wandering in their minds now,</v>

142
00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.580
<v Speaker 1>dia really have no viewpoints.</v>

143
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.990
<v Speaker 1>Do you have no bias at all?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

144
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.200
<v Speaker 1>are you complete fuel and talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>each and every issue?</v>

145
00:07:18.290 --> 00:07:21.350
<v Speaker 1>And the honest answer there is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

146
00:07:21.351 --> 00:07:24.080
<v Speaker 1>anybody can be completely neutral when </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about politics,</v>

147
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:28.820
<v Speaker 1>not even in theory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From the very moment once opic is chosen</v>

148
00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>over another appoints already being </v>
<v Speaker 1>made,</v>

149
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:35.000
<v Speaker 1>it's just totally inescapable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with that in mind is what is our view</v>

150
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.834
<v Speaker 1>and what is our bias?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What I think it's probably best </v>

151
00:07:37.341 --> 00:07:38.174
<v Speaker 1>described in a more positive light as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>principal and that principal would </v>

152
00:07:40.341 --> 00:07:43.340
<v Speaker 1>simply be freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We believe freedom should be an absolute</v>

153
00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.203
<v Speaker 1>core value of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more specifically respect for the </v>

154
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:50.690
<v Speaker 1>freedom and the civil rights of people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the greatest degree possible.</v>

155
00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:53.570
<v Speaker 1>Another principle we stand for is </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural understanding.</v>

156
00:07:53.571 --> 00:07:54.404
<v Speaker 1>We've consistently stated that free </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade between countries and cooperation </v>

157
00:07:57.561 --> 00:08:01.910
<v Speaker 1>among peoples is the best mechanism for </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace and prosperity on a global scale.</v>

158
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:04.070
<v Speaker 1>As we've demonstrated in many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many videos,</v>

159
00:08:04.071 --> 00:08:04.904
<v Speaker 1>the evidence shows that isolationism and</v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionism do not lead to anything </v>

160
00:08:08.541 --> 00:08:09.590
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But finally,</v>

161
00:08:09.591 --> 00:08:12.260
<v Speaker 1>almost important principle is not to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>dogmatic.</v>

162
00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:13.123
<v Speaker 1>Everything we say is fact based and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have our minds changed if someone </v>

163
00:08:16.491 --> 00:08:17.324
<v Speaker 1>gives us a good reason to change them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why your feedback and your </v>

164
00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:22.010
<v Speaker 1>comments are so important to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects.</v>

165
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:22.844
<v Speaker 1>You the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>provide us with new information and new </v>

166
00:08:24.681 --> 00:08:25.514
<v Speaker 1>sources and many of our videos are made </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply because one of you contacted us </v>

167
00:08:28.251 --> 00:08:31.400
<v Speaker 1>with information about the country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said we should make a video about it.</v>

168
00:08:31.730 --> 00:08:32.563
<v Speaker 1>So all of that was a really long way for</v>
<v Speaker 1>me to introduce you to something that </v>

169
00:08:35.121 --> 00:08:37.520
<v Speaker 1>you're probably already know quite a bit</v>
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>

170
00:08:37.521 --> 00:08:39.770
<v Speaker 1>But now let me tell you something you </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't know.</v>

171
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you where we want to be in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>

172
00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.590
<v Speaker 1>We wants to go further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to make more content.</v>

173
00:08:55.591 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>We want to make more videos in different</v>
<v Speaker 1>formats.</v>

174
00:08:58.051 --> 00:09:00.930
<v Speaker 1>We want to go to different places around</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world and show them to you.</v>

175
00:09:00.931 --> 00:09:03.930
<v Speaker 1>We want to introduce you to the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the stories.</v>

176
00:09:03.931 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 1>The people who really are changing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world that we live in.</v>

177
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:08.040
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on top of that,</v>

178
00:09:08.041 --> 00:09:11.130
<v Speaker 1>we also want to have our own website </v>
<v Speaker 1>with more official policy concepts.</v>

179
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:12.023
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to take visual politic to the </v>

180
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:14.634
<v Speaker 1>next level and take this community that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we've built along with us and we need </v>

181
00:09:18.841 --> 00:09:20.760
<v Speaker 1>your help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you have asked us already why we</v>

182
00:09:20.761 --> 00:09:23.010
<v Speaker 1>don't have a Patrion page and the truth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

183
00:09:23.011 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 1>but it's something that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>considering for a really long time.</v>

184
00:09:25.741 --> 00:09:28.050
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that we realized that if we</v>
<v Speaker 1>want to do more,</v>

185
00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:28.913
<v Speaker 1>we need more and we need a way to do it </v>
<v Speaker 1>while maintaining independence and now </v>

186
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:35.100
<v Speaker 1>everyone else who wants to help us can,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to,</v>

187
00:09:35.101 --> 00:09:38.760
<v Speaker 1>you can join us in taking visual politic</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the next level and just quickly,</v>

188
00:09:38.761 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who don't know about </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

189
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:41.043
<v Speaker 1>patron is a platform that connects </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators with those who want to </v>

190
00:09:43.261 --> 00:09:46.000
<v Speaker 1>contribute financially to that creator </v>
<v Speaker 1>below.</v>

191
00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:49.110
<v Speaker 1>We're not taking anything away here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's really important to say.</v>

192
00:09:49.111 --> 00:09:49.944
<v Speaker 1>The classic visual politic videos that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we post every week on youtube will </v>

193
00:09:52.171 --> 00:09:54.540
<v Speaker 1>always be available to everyone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>free.</v>

194
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.550
<v Speaker 1>But now for less than what you pay for a</v>
<v Speaker 1>beer,</v>

195
00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.470
<v Speaker 1>you can make all our ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more videos,</v>

196
00:09:58.471 --> 00:09:59.304
<v Speaker 1>more specials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so websites and even essentially books </v>

197
00:10:01.290 --> 00:10:02.250
<v Speaker 1>or reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

198
00:10:02.251 --> 00:10:03.084
<v Speaker 1>if you do contribute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to get access to exclusive </v>

199
00:10:04.651 --> 00:10:06.960
<v Speaker 1>contents as well as plenty of other </v>

<v Speaker 1>If you click the link in the description</v>
<v Speaker 1>box below,</v>

<v Speaker 1>learn more about the goals that we've </v>

202

203
00:10:13.561 --> 00:10:15.600
<v Speaker 1>choose the type of commitment that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might want to have.</v>

204
00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:16.523
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to use this opportunity to </v>

205

<v Speaker 1>thank you for your support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to you,</v>

210
00:10:30.331 --> 00:10:31.164
<v Speaker 1>continue to grow into an even greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>community with more possibilities and </v>
