1
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.790
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg is the only country in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is prime minister is openly gay.</v>

2
00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 1>tolerance,</v>

3
00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:16.680
<v Speaker 1>open-minded societies on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

4
00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:17.523
<v Speaker 1>they have a population of around 500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants and 40 percent of them are </v>

5
00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:21.510
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg is the smallest country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union,</v>

7
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.840
<v Speaker 1>but the one with the biggest share of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants nonetheless,</v>

8
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.220
<v Speaker 1>what made Luxenberg famous can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>summarized in just one word.</v>

9
00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 1>And that word is money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

10
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:39.394
<v Speaker 1>Do you have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have the grants actually of </v>

11
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:43.990
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg is one of the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthiest countries on earth here.</v>

12
00:00:43.991 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>The minimum wage is around 2000 euros a </v>
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>

13
00:00:46.871 --> 00:00:48.190
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not average wage.</v>

14
00:00:48.191 --> 00:00:51.490
<v Speaker 1>That's the minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The normal wage in Luxembourg.</v>

15
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:52.443
<v Speaker 1>5,000 euros a month for comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourgish people have a GDP per </v>

16
00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:00.810
<v Speaker 1>capita twice as big as that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australians or the dangers.</v>

17
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

18
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.320
<v Speaker 1>But just hold on for a second because </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a little trick in this figure.</v>

19
00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:12.183
<v Speaker 1>You see almost half of the work is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country actually live outside of </v>

20
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:16.834
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyday around 160,000 people commute </v>

21
00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:19.834
<v Speaker 1>to this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then go back to their homes in </v>

22
00:01:21.461 --> 00:01:22.390
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

23
00:01:22.391 --> 00:01:23.710
<v Speaker 1>or Belgium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

24
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.680
<v Speaker 1>they create wealth in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't live that.</v>

25
00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.460
<v Speaker 1>This is why when we divide Luxembourg's </v>
<v Speaker 1>GDB among their population,</v>

26
00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:32.130
<v Speaker 1>we get such an enormous number,</v>

27
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.893
<v Speaker 1>even with these statistical deviations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one can deny that Luxembourg is kind </v>

28
00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:48.000
<v Speaker 1>of a country for many ins and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>explains why it's capital.</v>

29
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:48.863
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg city is among these cities in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world with the highest quality of </v>

30
00:01:52.471 --> 00:01:53.304
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you might think that this can </v>

31
00:01:54.541 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 1>all be explained because Luxembourg is a</v>
<v Speaker 1>fiscal haven,</v>

32
00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:58.343
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Malaysia and Cyprus also have low </v>

33
00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:02.064
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they are not even half as rich as </v>

34
00:02:03.961 --> 00:02:04.794
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the big question here is what does </v>

35
00:02:07.111 --> 00:02:10.530
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg happens that makes them so </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly wealthy?</v>

36
00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>What did they do in this country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy such a fantastic quality of life</v>

37
00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.360
<v Speaker 2>life today?</v>

38
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.323
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to answer that very </v>

39
00:02:23.461 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

40
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The kings of steel by the rag and 15,</v>

41
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg became an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent country.</v>

42
00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.373
<v Speaker 1>And I say independence because none of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its neighbors really recognized its </v>

43
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:43.454
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France and Germany used to be back then </v>

44
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.740
<v Speaker 1>for for control over the dap sheet on </v>
<v Speaker 1>several occasions.</v>

45
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.563
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite their government's desire for </v>

46
00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.340
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory of Luxembourg was owned by</v>

47
00:02:59.341 --> 00:03:01.270
<v Speaker 1>King William the third of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Netherlands.</v>

48
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:02.163
<v Speaker 1>During these years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg was far from being a wealthy </v>

49
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:05.104
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of its citizens survived thanks to </v>

50
00:03:06.521 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and iron mining back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in every five people from Luxembourg</v>

51
00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>was emigrating to America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

52
00:03:12.791 --> 00:03:13.624
<v Speaker 1>living between two rival countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>France and Russia had its advantages </v>

53
00:03:16.511 --> 00:03:17.350
<v Speaker 1>too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

54
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.110
<v Speaker 1>during this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany didn't exist as a country.</v>

55
00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.120
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were a lot of republics,</v>

56
00:03:22.121 --> 00:03:25.210
<v Speaker 1>kingdoms and Dutchies united under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>confederation.</v>

57
00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.670
<v Speaker 3>If you want to know what a confederation</v>
<v Speaker 3>is,</v>

58
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:32.504
<v Speaker 3>well click on this video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The truth is all the German states </v>

59
00:03:34.911 --> 00:03:39.170
<v Speaker 3>traded among themselves that basically </v>
<v Speaker 3>created a special free trade zone,</v>

60
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 3>which they called the silver,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

61
00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 3>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so in 1942,</v>

62
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:45.080
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg became a member of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>zollverein.</v>

63
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.270
<v Speaker 3>And since that point history,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what?</v>

64
00:03:47.271 --> 00:03:49.400
<v Speaker 3>It would never be the same again.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As I said before,</v>

65
00:03:49.401 --> 00:03:52.160
<v Speaker 3>poor Luxembourg was based on two main </v>
<v Speaker 3>industries,</v>

66
00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.590
<v Speaker 3>agriculture and iron mining,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and remember here,</v>

67
00:03:54.591 --> 00:03:56.840
<v Speaker 3>these are the times of the industrial </v>
<v Speaker 3>revolution,</v>

68
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.520
<v Speaker 3>still was needed for,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

69
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.383
<v Speaker 3>basically everything.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was used in everything from machines </v>

70
00:04:02.451 --> 00:04:07.040
<v Speaker 3>to buildings and Luxembourgish citizens </v>
<v Speaker 3>while they were sitting on top of a pile</v>

71
00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:07.874
<v Speaker 3>of iron,</v>

72
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.113
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a tiny country </v>

73
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.690
<v Speaker 1>placed in the intersection between </v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

74
00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:17.950
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Belgium.</v>

75
00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.140
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the perfect points.</v>

76
00:04:20.141 --> 00:04:24.070
<v Speaker 1>Have a railroad so they could send the </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron to all three countries.</v>

77
00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:27.790
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg became ground zero for all of</v>

78
00:04:27.791 --> 00:04:32.080
<v Speaker 1>these trade routes as well as one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest steel providers on the planet.</v>

79
00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:33.213
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of those New York skyscrapers were </v>

80
00:04:35.681 --> 00:04:36.514
<v Speaker 1>built with beams made in this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the biggest steel companies </v>

81
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.280
<v Speaker 1>are luxembourgish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest of them all.</v>

82
00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:48.173
<v Speaker 1>Arcelor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mittal is one that you might have even </v>

83
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>heard about and financial newspapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and although as in just a few decades,</v>

84
00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.880
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg gone to the same level as its</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>

85
00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.690
<v Speaker 1>but still it was not the economic dmf </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it is today.</v>

86
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.800
<v Speaker 1>They still need to</v>

87
00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 3>special sauce.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That special sauce was this</v>

88
00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.313
<v Speaker 1>29?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the year when Luxembourg past </v>

89
00:05:11.851 --> 00:05:12.684
<v Speaker 1>the holding goal bonds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait just a minute here because you </v>

90
00:05:15.361 --> 00:05:16.950
<v Speaker 1>might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

91
00:05:16.951 --> 00:05:19.230
<v Speaker 1>what's corporate holding all about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

92
00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.090
<v Speaker 1>let's take a cookie cutter as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

93
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.090
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola isn't beverage brand,</v>

94
00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:25.380
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand that is the Coca </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cola company.</v>

95
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.190
<v Speaker 1>This is a big conglomerate that contains</v>
<v Speaker 1>other companies like Faenza Schweppes or</v>

96
00:05:29.191 --> 00:05:30.650
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beverage brand.</v>

97
00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.740
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

98
00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:36.573
<v Speaker 1>so this big conglomerates is called a </v>
<v Speaker 1>holding corporation that owns the </v>

99
00:05:39.131 --> 00:05:39.964
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his insight it alcohol subsidiary </v>

100
00:05:41.261 --> 00:05:42.094
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These subsidiaries can be in different </v>

101
00:05:43.781 --> 00:05:46.810
<v Speaker 1>countries and all the guys who produce </v>
<v Speaker 1>and distribute the drinks.</v>

102
00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:47.703
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the role of the holding company is </v>

103
00:05:48.851 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>mainly to manage the property of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>other subsidiary companies.</v>

104
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:53.710
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this 19,</v>

105
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:54.544
<v Speaker 1>29 law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's offered amazingly good tax </v>

106
00:05:56.501 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 1>conditions to those holding companies.</v>

107
00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 3>Basically they paid around one percent</v>

108
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:02.043
<v Speaker 2>tap.</v>

109
00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:07.053
<v Speaker 1>These were the 19 thirties and back then</v>
<v Speaker 1>there wasn't as many holding companies </v>

110
00:06:09.761 --> 00:06:11.260
<v Speaker 1>as there are today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnson,</v>

111
00:06:11.261 --> 00:06:12.094
<v Speaker 1>remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those were the years when Coca Cola was </v>

112
00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.130
<v Speaker 1>starting to expand to other markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Luxembourg was doing great,</v>

113
00:06:18.131 --> 00:06:20.020
<v Speaker 1>but they still want the drawing where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they are today.</v>

114
00:06:20.170 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg was growing but not that much</v>

115
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:24.514
<v Speaker 1>more than other countries.</v>

116
00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:26.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

117
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.353
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the seventies were other times when </v>

118
00:06:34.351 --> 00:06:35.184
<v Speaker 3>American companies conquered the </v>
<v Speaker 3>European and Asian markets that finally </v>

119
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:40.110
<v Speaker 3>had some money to spend on consumer </v>
<v Speaker 3>goods.</v>

120
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:40.973
<v Speaker 3>During these years,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many of the big corporations we know </v>

121
00:06:43.051 --> 00:06:44.460
<v Speaker 3>today were born.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

122
00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.353
<v Speaker 3>a lot of holding sprang up and their </v>
<v Speaker 3>profits came from all around the </v>

123
00:06:47.821 --> 00:06:49.920
<v Speaker 3>planets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So where did they decide to set up their</v>

124
00:06:49.921 --> 00:06:51.050
<v Speaker 3>headquarters?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

125
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.980
<v Speaker 3>since they could choose anywhere they </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to,</v>

126
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.740
<v Speaker 3>they went to the places with the best </v>
<v Speaker 3>fiscal conditions.</v>

127
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg has everything they want,</v>
<v Speaker 3>says a whole lot more.</v>

128
00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.500
<v Speaker 3>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by the 19 sixties and seventies,</v>

129
00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:04.110
<v Speaker 3>the country already had a big banking </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

130
00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:05.003
<v Speaker 3>The best lawyers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>accountants and economists were living </v>

131
00:07:06.481 --> 00:07:07.314
<v Speaker 3>there ready to help those big companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>in order to take advantage of those </v>

132
00:07:10.531 --> 00:07:11.364
<v Speaker 3>business friendly laws.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And this is how this little country </v>

133
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.710
<v Speaker 3>glance into their silver decades.</v>

134
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:23.383
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe what you see the economy </v>

135
00:07:24.531 --> 00:07:29.531
<v Speaker 1>of Luxembourg became two times bigger in</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than six years compared to this.</v>

136
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 1>China or Singapore is great rate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's kind of a joke and yes,</v>

137
00:07:32.751 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 1>you heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did say before silver decade,</v>

138
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 1>because all of this growth was nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>compared to what was to come.</v>

139
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.973
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are already talking about the two </v>

140
00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:44.630
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of the online business.</v>

141
00:07:44.631 --> 00:07:45.464
<v Speaker 1>Boom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These brand new corporate juggernauts </v>

142
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.223
<v Speaker 1>operated all over the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had dozens of subsidiary companies in </v>

143
00:07:51.801 --> 00:07:52.634
<v Speaker 1>every country are not concentrated in </v>
<v Speaker 1>any specific location because they sold </v>

144
00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:01.360
<v Speaker 1>every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

145
00:08:01.851 --> 00:08:04.970
<v Speaker 1>these tech companies were made some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg,</v>

146
00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:05.953
<v Speaker 1>so if you've got this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was already astoundingly rich and </v>

147
00:08:07.761 --> 00:08:09.890
<v Speaker 1>could have grown more well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think?</v>

148
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.013
<v Speaker 2>Twice</v>

149
00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:21.873
<v Speaker 3>amazing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>isn't it?</v>

150
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:23.950
<v Speaker 3>I don't know if you noticed this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in just five years,</v>

151
00:08:23.980 --> 00:08:27.400
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg's GDP per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I went from 50,000 US dollars,</v>

152
00:08:27.401 --> 00:08:28.234
<v Speaker 3>which is already a lost over $100,000 </v>
<v Speaker 3>when you live in the country where the </v>

153
00:08:33.101 --> 00:08:35.560
<v Speaker 3>GDP per capita of over $100,000</v>

154
00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:38.880
<v Speaker 1>can fill the old swimming pool with </v>
<v Speaker 1>champagne.</v>

155
00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:39.833
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Audi a three is the third best </v>

156
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:42.354
<v Speaker 1>selling car in</v>

157
00:08:50.670 --> 00:08:51.030
<v Speaker 4>and yes.</v>

158
00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:51.863
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they probably do know what you're </v>

159
00:08:51.911 --> 00:08:54.390
<v Speaker 3>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You think that this country has made its</v>

160
00:08:54.391 --> 00:08:57.960
<v Speaker 3>fortune by companies avoid paying taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

161
00:08:58.020 --> 00:08:59.040
<v Speaker 3>Well beyond,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sir.</v>

162
00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:01.080
<v Speaker 3>It's a little bit more complicated than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that.</v>

163
00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:04.240
<v Speaker 3>You see the facts that are holding </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporation is located in Luxembourg,</v>

164
00:09:04.241 --> 00:09:05.074
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>does not mean that its subsidiary </v>

165
00:09:05.761 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 3>companies don't pay taxes elsewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For instance,</v>

166
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.440
<v Speaker 3>Amazon has its headquarters in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg.</v>

167
00:09:10.500 --> 00:09:11.333
<v Speaker 3>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's British subsidiary that is the </v>

168
00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:13.404
<v Speaker 3>company that sells products and managers</v>
<v Speaker 3>and logistics in this country still has </v>

169
00:09:16.261 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 3>to pay taxes in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or at least that is the theory.</v>

170
00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:21.033
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality is way different school lux </v>

171
00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:28.260
<v Speaker 3>leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So let's get back to our Amazon example.</v>

172
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:29.153
<v Speaker 3>As we said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the profits of his British subsidiary </v>

173
00:09:30.331 --> 00:09:32.340
<v Speaker 3>are taxed in the UK rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

174
00:09:32.341 --> 00:09:33.174
<v Speaker 3>the question that then comes up is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what if they don't have any profits </v>

175
00:09:35.671 --> 00:09:38.490
<v Speaker 3>whatsoever?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Imagine that right after they pay taxes,</v>

176
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.324
<v Speaker 3>Amazon UK gets a big loan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a big loan with a really high interest </v>

177
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:43.074
<v Speaker 3>rates so high in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that the company takes losses and who </v>

178
00:09:45.781 --> 00:09:46.980
<v Speaker 3>lends them that money?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Exactly.</v>

179
00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.941
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>

180
00:09:47.941 --> 00:09:49.890
<v Speaker 3>that would be Amazon Holdings in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg.</v>

181
00:09:49.950 --> 00:09:50.783
<v Speaker 3>This weight,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these subsidiary companies have almost </v>

182
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:54.390
<v Speaker 3>no profits.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One way or another,</v>

183
00:09:54.391 --> 00:09:55.224
<v Speaker 3>they managed to send them money to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Luxembourg brunch and that's what you </v>

184
00:09:57.921 --> 00:10:01.320
<v Speaker 3>said before in Luxembourg.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Taxes are really low for companies.</v>

185
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:06.300
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

186
00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:10.140
<v Speaker 3>this is perfectly legal bus.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2009 during the financial crisis,</v>

187
00:10:10.141 --> 00:10:10.974
<v Speaker 3>the American governments realized the </v>
<v Speaker 3>huge amounts of money they were losing </v>

188
00:10:13.201 --> 00:10:15.480
<v Speaker 3>with all of these big companies moving </v>
<v Speaker 3>overseas.</v>

189
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:16.423
<v Speaker 5>That's why today I'm announcing a set of</v>
<v Speaker 5>proposals to crack down on illegal </v>

190
00:10:19.791 --> 00:10:20.624
<v Speaker 5>overseas tax evasion,</v>
<v Speaker 5>close loopholes and make it more </v>

191
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:27.710
<v Speaker 5>profitable for companies to create jobs </v>
<v Speaker 5>here in the United States.</v>

192
00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:28.773
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other governments have also followed in </v>

193
00:10:30.341 --> 00:10:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Obama's steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

194
00:10:31.750 --> 00:10:32.583
<v Speaker 1>don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg is one of the European </v>

195
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:35.860
<v Speaker 1>Union's founding members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His name is the other club.</v>

196
00:10:35.861 --> 00:10:39.550
<v Speaker 1>Members were angry and willing to lay on</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of political pressure,</v>

197
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:43.150
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest crisis for this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>came in the year 2014.</v>

198
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.163
<v Speaker 1>This was the time when a group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>accountants released a ton of private </v>

199
00:10:47.681 --> 00:10:49.090
<v Speaker 1>data for these big corporations.</v>

200
00:10:54.890 --> 00:10:55.440
<v Speaker 4>Thanks</v>

201
00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:56.273
<v Speaker 1>so called Lux leaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could all see the tax evasion </v>

202
00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>strategies employed by thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>different companies.</v>

203
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:03.733
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you remember what I told you about </v>

204
00:11:04.071 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 1>loans between different subsidiary </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies within a holding.</v>

205
00:11:07.250 --> 00:11:08.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is another way of improving the </v>

206
00:11:09.231 --> 00:11:12.110
<v Speaker 1>deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all these big companies hire big</v>

207
00:11:12.111 --> 00:11:12.944
<v Speaker 1>consulting firms so they can help them </v>
<v Speaker 1>with their accounting consulting firms </v>

208
00:11:15.741 --> 00:11:20.240
<v Speaker 1>like pricewaterhouse coopers with a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>customer portfolio in Luxembourg.</v>

209
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.090
<v Speaker 1>That enough power to sit down with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister back then,</v>

210
00:11:23.091 --> 00:11:24.100
<v Speaker 1>John Golan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jamaica,</v>

211
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 1>and arrange a special tax deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No current spotlight after Luxembourg.</v>

212
00:11:30.680 --> 00:11:31.513
<v Speaker 1>Tax Revelations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaked documents demonstrate tax </v>

213
00:11:34.431 --> 00:11:37.880
<v Speaker 1>arrangements negotiated by price </v>
<v Speaker 1>waterhouse coopers.</v>

214
00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:38.803
<v Speaker 1>As you could imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the release of the luxleaks was a total </v>

215
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:41.930
<v Speaker 1>game changer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

216
00:11:41.931 --> 00:11:42.764
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 Luxembourg past a brand's new </v>

217
00:11:45.441 --> 00:11:46.274
<v Speaker 1>fiscal reform and probably many of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrangements are going to have to </v>

218
00:11:49.701 --> 00:11:50.534
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a minute here because </v>

219
00:11:51.981 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>this doesn't mean that is going to stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>being a rich place.</v>

220
00:11:55.210 --> 00:11:56.950
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is probably true.</v>

221
00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:01.473
<v Speaker 1>Despite this political turbulence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country group at a rate of four </v>

222
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:07.510
<v Speaker 1>point two percent last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is way faster than almost any other</v>

223
00:12:07.511 --> 00:12:09.700
<v Speaker 1>country in Europe having so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>savings.</v>

224
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg has invested in many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>

225
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:13.450
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

226
00:12:13.451 --> 00:12:14.284
<v Speaker 1>they have steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their bank suddenly also have </v>

227
00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:17.163
<v Speaker 1>space.</v>

228
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:18.233
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

229
00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:26.280
<v Speaker 1>Burgs bent on space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Industry shows early signs of success.</v>

230
00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:27.330
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

231
00:12:27.331 --> 00:12:28.164
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxembourg in the United States of the </v>

232
00:12:29.221 --> 00:12:32.280
<v Speaker 1>first countries to pass laws regulating </v>
<v Speaker 1>space mining,</v>

233
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:33.263
<v Speaker 1>and this tiny country is expected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the Silicon Valley of the </v>

234
00:12:35.491 --> 00:12:38.670
<v Speaker 1>aerospace industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains partly some of the details</v>

235
00:12:38.671 --> 00:12:41.220
<v Speaker 1>of the 2017 fiscal reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

236
00:12:41.221 --> 00:12:42.054
<v Speaker 1>the government of Luxembourg doesn't </v>
