00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.720
<v Speaker 2>It's a challenge for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll show you.</v>

3
00:00:08.721 --> 00:00:11.930
<v Speaker 2>Finish watching this video goes your </v>
<v Speaker 2>kitchen and open the fridge.</v>

4
00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.800
<v Speaker 2>Then try to find something that has been</v>
<v Speaker 2>produced outside of your country.</v>

5
00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.410
<v Speaker 2>If you're watching this video from a </v>
<v Speaker 2>European country,</v>

6
00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 2>tried to find some product produced </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside of the European Union,</v>

7
00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 2>I bet she probably can't even find it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maybe this doesn't surprise you.</v>

8
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.303
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you think about it a little more </v>

9
00:00:32.031 --> 00:00:32.864
<v Speaker 2>considered that your mobile phone has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been manufactured in more than 20 </v>

10
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.450
<v Speaker 2>different countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The trousers you're wearing right now,</v>

11
00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:42.080
<v Speaker 2>we're probably manufactured in a country</v>
<v Speaker 2>like China or Bangladesh,</v>

12
00:00:42.081 --> 00:00:45.170
<v Speaker 2>and maybe the company you work for is </v>
<v Speaker 2>also foreign.</v>

13
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's no surprises there,</v>

14
00:00:46.941 --> 00:00:47.570
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

15
00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.420
<v Speaker 2>we will live in a globalized economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless.</v>

16
00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.520
<v Speaker 2>Food is the exception to the rule.</v>

17
00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:54.303
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>

18
00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.893
<v Speaker 2>agriculture is an industry that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>completely protected from foreign </v>

19
00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:01.973
<v Speaker 2>competition and make no mistake here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has nothing to do with Donald </v>

20
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.240
<v Speaker 2>Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

21
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.370
<v Speaker 2>if you think he's the creator of trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>was,</v>

22
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.070
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your actually absolutely wrong.</v>

23
00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.933
<v Speaker 2>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the primary sector exists in a never </v>

24
00:01:14.271 --> 00:01:15.104
<v Speaker 2>ending cold war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why from time to time we see </v>

25
00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 2>headlines like this one</v>

26
00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.870
<v Speaker 2>war rips through farm world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>soybean hog prices fall,</v>

27
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.790
<v Speaker 2>or maybe this one cuts import tariffs in</v>
<v Speaker 2>a bid to end.</v>

28
00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.360
<v Speaker 2>Banana wars are morven tariffs out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

29
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:36.253
<v Speaker 2>tariffs aren't just one of the many </v>
<v Speaker 2>tools you use to attack foreign markets </v>

30
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.970
<v Speaker 2>bands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're not even the deadliest.</v>

31
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:41.833
<v Speaker 2>Here's an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>American spends more than $20 billion a </v>

32
00:01:44.511 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 2>year in subsidies that are farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>sounded like a lot to you.</v>

33
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not compared to the whopping $72 billion</v>

34
00:01:51.291 --> 00:01:54.290
<v Speaker 2>that the EU spends in subsidies every </v>
<v Speaker 2>single year.</v>

35
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.180
<v Speaker 2>And how you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

36
00:01:56.181 --> 00:01:58.790
<v Speaker 2>what do the subsidies have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade was,</v>

37
00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
<v Speaker 2>and the answer that as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A lot example,</v>

38
00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.913
<v Speaker 2>this milk rake you see on the screen </v>
<v Speaker 2>here is worth an average of 60 euro </v>

39
00:02:09.491 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 2>cents and a Spanish supermarket from </v>
<v Speaker 2>those 60 cents.</v>

40
00:02:12.821 --> 00:02:13.654
<v Speaker 2>The Spanish Pharma would get 30 cents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's actual revenue is going to be </v>

41
00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 2>44 cents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is this?</v>

42
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.343
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's because the European Union will </v>

43
00:02:21.341 --> 00:02:24.460
<v Speaker 2>give them a subsidy of 14 cents per </v>
<v Speaker 2>liter,</v>

44
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.833
<v Speaker 2>thanks to this grand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the farmer can sell cheap and still </v>

45
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:31.354
<v Speaker 2>make money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why Europe doesn't need to </v>

46
00:02:33.071 --> 00:02:37.600
<v Speaker 2>buy African sugar despite it being </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheaper or even more surprisingly,</v>

47
00:02:37.601 --> 00:02:38.434
<v Speaker 2>why American or European producers can </v>
<v Speaker 2>snatch the competition from African </v>

48
00:02:41.711 --> 00:02:44.440
<v Speaker 2>markets despite there having higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>wages.</v>

49
00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.460
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a minute here because things</v>
<v Speaker 2>are about to change.</v>

50
00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:51.790
<v Speaker 2>And this time the free market champion </v>
<v Speaker 2>is not America.</v>

51
00:02:51.791 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 2>It's not Japan or even Australia dare </v>
<v Speaker 2>viewer,</v>

52
00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.863
<v Speaker 2>despite what you might expect if there </v>
<v Speaker 2>is somebody willing to start an </v>

53
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 2>agricultural.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's actually the European.</v>

54
00:03:01.871 --> 00:03:01.990
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

55
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.823
<v Speaker 1>union.</v>

56
00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 2>Well macron breaks French taboo on farm </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies.</v>

57
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.773
<v Speaker 2>A French president questioning these </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies on farming is like a hipster </v>

58
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.063
<v Speaker 2>closing his instagram accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that's never been done </v>

59
00:03:17.951 --> 00:03:18.784
<v Speaker 2>before for years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The so called Common Agricultural </v>

60
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.113
<v Speaker 2>Policy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>also known as the CAAP has been one of </v>

61
00:03:23.951 --> 00:03:28.930
<v Speaker 2>the pillars of the European Union and </v>
<v Speaker 2>France is by far its biggest supporter.</v>

62
00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 2>But like I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things that are about to change.</v>

63
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.123
<v Speaker 2>So now the question becomes is you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>really ready to liberalize its </v>

64
00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:38.100
<v Speaker 2>agricultural sex up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

65
00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:41.950
<v Speaker 2>we about to see the ends of the food </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade wars.</v>

66
00:03:41.951 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>And most importantly of all here is this</v>
<v Speaker 2>good or bad news swell.</v>

67
00:03:46.121 --> 00:03:48.870
<v Speaker 2>In this video we are going the answer </v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these questions,</v>

68
00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back.</v>

69
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.033
<v Speaker 1>The history</v>

70
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.083
<v Speaker 2>he used for,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's imagine that we have a wheat farm </v>

71
00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:04.590
<v Speaker 2>in Essex in the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We harvest the crop and go to sell it to</v>

72
00:04:04.591 --> 00:04:04.910
<v Speaker 2>the month.</v>

73
00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:05.743
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

74
00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 2>boss time we did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we received 175 pounds per ton.</v>

75
00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:18.280
<v Speaker 2>So it makes sense to expect to sell it </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a similar price this time around,</v>

76
00:04:18.281 --> 00:04:20.500
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well actually no,</v>

77
00:04:20.501 --> 00:04:21.334
<v Speaker 2>I mean maybe this time the market price </v>
<v Speaker 2>for wheat is actually just 150 pounds </v>

78
00:04:25.391 --> 00:04:26.224
<v Speaker 2>per ton.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a reality that every farmer </v>

79
00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.280
<v Speaker 2>faces every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By contrast,</v>

80
00:04:30.281 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>the price of an iphone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't really change much over time.</v>

81
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.294
<v Speaker 2>So if we sell I phones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can make good predictions about our </v>

82
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.134
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but wheat,</v>

83
00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:38.973
<v Speaker 2>corn oil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or any other commodity can change their </v>

84
00:04:41.171 --> 00:04:46.171
<v Speaker 2>market price from one day to the next.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>

85
00:04:47.351 --> 00:04:48.490
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

86
00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:50.170
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why does this happen?</v>

87
00:04:50.171 --> 00:04:52.930
<v Speaker 2>What is the difference between wheat and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's an iphone?</v>

88
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.530
<v Speaker 2>While the differences that commodities </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the same everywhere.</v>

89
00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.280
<v Speaker 2>Maybe you eat some bread today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could you tell me where the weeks it was</v>

90
00:05:00.281 --> 00:05:01.810
<v Speaker 2>made from?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's produced?</v>

91
00:05:01.811 --> 00:05:03.460
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>probably not.</v>

92
00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.353
<v Speaker 2>The same goes with the oil used to </v>
<v Speaker 2>produce the gasoline that you put in </v>

93
00:05:07.061 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 2>your car.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You don't know if it's Saudi or Canadian</v>

94
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253
<v Speaker 2>and you don't really care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You just want it to be as absolutely </v>

95
00:05:14.411 --> 00:05:19.411
<v Speaker 2>cheap as possible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

96
00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:22.490
<v Speaker 2>there I'll just a few dinosaur juice </v>
<v Speaker 2>producers.</v>

97
00:05:22.491 --> 00:05:24.920
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many producers of wheat,</v>

98
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.420
<v Speaker 2>corn,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and potatoes,</v>

99
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:29.240
<v Speaker 2>so if one big producer had a good </v>
<v Speaker 2>harvest,</v>

100
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.630
<v Speaker 2>that's going to affect that market price</v>
<v Speaker 2>for everybody.</v>

101
00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.070
<v Speaker 2>And then of course you've got to add to </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

102
00:05:34.071 --> 00:05:35.470
<v Speaker 2>the weather,</v>
<v Speaker 2>too little rain,</v>

103
00:05:35.471 --> 00:05:40.070
<v Speaker 2>too much rain or an unusually cold.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Windsor can be enough to kill off all of</v>

104
00:05:40.071 --> 00:05:41.330
<v Speaker 2>your revenue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

105
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:46.360
<v Speaker 2>we need agriculture because </v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately you cannot eat oil or only</v>

106
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.323
<v Speaker 2>phones.</v>

107
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.940
<v Speaker 2>So how can we keep eating while farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't staff?</v>

108
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.130
<v Speaker 2>Now this might sound like a stupid </v>
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>

109
00:05:56.131 --> 00:05:56.964
<v Speaker 2>but belief knee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the hardest problems in </v>

110
00:05:59.241 --> 00:06:00.074
<v Speaker 2>economics as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is where that common agricultural </v>

111
00:06:02.451 --> 00:06:04.790
<v Speaker 2>policy that we mentioned comes into </v>
<v Speaker 2>play.</v>

112
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:07.850
<v Speaker 2>This is how the European Union protects </v>
<v Speaker 2>the farmers.</v>

113
00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:13.613
<v Speaker 2>When we talk about the CAAP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about the cornerstone of </v>

114
00:06:16.261 --> 00:06:17.094
<v Speaker 2>the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was the thing even before the </v>

115
00:06:18.781 --> 00:06:21.540
<v Speaker 2>Schengen area or the eurozone were even </v>
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>

116
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:22.703
<v Speaker 2>Ashley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know who the father of the CIP </v>

117
00:06:24.271 --> 00:06:25.110
<v Speaker 2>was?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

118
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was that French president,</v>

119
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.620
<v Speaker 2>Charles de [inaudible]</v>

120
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:28.453
<v Speaker 1>gold</v>

121
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:36.310
<v Speaker 2>nation has no friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only interests.</v>

122
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.170
<v Speaker 2>Charles did God.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

123
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:40.780
<v Speaker 2>if you've been subscribed to visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic for a while,</v>

124
00:06:40.781 --> 00:06:41.614
<v Speaker 2>you already know that Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the goal was not exactly a big fan of </v>

125
00:06:44.591 --> 00:06:45.790
<v Speaker 2>the free markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

126
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:48.670
<v Speaker 2>actually he wasn't really a big fan of </v>
<v Speaker 2>anyone except himself.</v>

127
00:06:48.671 --> 00:06:50.470
<v Speaker 2>Really.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why we're in France,</v>

128
00:06:50.471 --> 00:06:52.660
<v Speaker 2>became a member of the European single </v>
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>

129
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 2>What would later become the European </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union.</v>

130
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:57.250
<v Speaker 2>He added a condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He basically said,</v>

131
00:06:57.360 --> 00:06:58.960
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to sign up,</v>

132
00:06:58.961 --> 00:06:59.794
<v Speaker 2>but you got to promise us that nobody's </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to become our competition for </v>

133
00:07:02.411 --> 00:07:03.190
<v Speaker 2>farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

134
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.023
<v Speaker 2>and basically that salvage the Apu was </v>
<v Speaker 2>born a policy that is so intervention </v>

135
00:07:07.810 --> 00:07:10.270
<v Speaker 2>list.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It makes Bernie Sanders look blank.</v>

136
00:07:10.271 --> 00:07:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Warren Buffett</v>

137
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.380
<v Speaker 1>basically</v>

138
00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 2>in order to compensate for potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>losses when market prices go down,</v>

139
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.280
<v Speaker 2>the European Union gives them direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>cash.</v>

140
00:07:22.550 --> 00:07:25.340
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a bond with cows in Spain,</v>

141
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.174
<v Speaker 2>Brussels will still give you cash </v>
<v Speaker 2>straight away for each and every calvet </v>

142
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.970
<v Speaker 2>you own.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And if you want to buy a milking machine</v>

143
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:33.530
<v Speaker 2>that is going to make you more </v>
<v Speaker 2>presumptive,</v>

144
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:35.630
<v Speaker 2>well Brussels is going to help you with </v>
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>

145
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:36.470
<v Speaker 2>Sue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this way,</v>

146
00:07:36.471 --> 00:07:38.360
<v Speaker 2>Europe is not only guaranteeing your </v>
<v Speaker 2>income,</v>

147
00:07:38.361 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 2>but it's also helping it to protect you </v>
<v Speaker 2>from American or African producers.</v>

148
00:07:43.130 --> 00:07:47.870
<v Speaker 2>And as you might have already imagined,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this aid costs say it's a load of</v>

149
00:07:47.871 --> 00:07:48.704
<v Speaker 2>money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you want to get a better idea </v>

150
00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:53.783
<v Speaker 2>during the 1990s the caap comprised 80% </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the whole European budgets and even </v>

151
00:07:59.331 --> 00:08:02.150
<v Speaker 2>now when Europe is bigger and it's got </v>
<v Speaker 2>more stuff to do,</v>

152
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.103
<v Speaker 2>the CAAP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it still makes up 40% of all you </v>

153
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:10.040
<v Speaker 2>spending and surprise surprise there I </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess which comes from,</v>

154
00:08:10.041 --> 00:08:13.220
<v Speaker 2>he receives most of the aids.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's France,</v>

155
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.083
<v Speaker 2>but hold on just a moment because things</v>
<v Speaker 2>they do not stop right here beyond his </v>

156
00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.533
<v Speaker 2>direct aid.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe also has other tactics to avoid </v>

157
00:08:20.871 --> 00:08:24.230
<v Speaker 2>price fluctuations as well as quotas and</v>
<v Speaker 2>tariffs.</v>

158
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:32.010
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to avoid a price drop in milk,</v>

159
00:08:32.011 --> 00:08:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Europe used to put a production limits </v>
<v Speaker 2>on each country.</v>

160
00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.360
<v Speaker 2>That means that you couldn't produce </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than a certain number of liters and</v>

161
00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:43.050
<v Speaker 2>it's of course he was benefiting the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most from these production quotas.</v>

162
00:08:43.230 --> 00:08:44.063
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it was the country of </v>

163
00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:48.480
<v Speaker 2>croissant and the guests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

164
00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:49.314
<v Speaker 2>this milk quota,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it created all kinds of problems among </v>

165
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:55.140
<v Speaker 2>the other members.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is why despite French pressure,</v>

166
00:08:55.230 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Europe had to put an end to all of this</v>

167
00:09:01.650 --> 00:09:06.400
<v Speaker 2>end of European milk quotas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a new era for the French dairy sector.</v>

168
00:09:06.460 --> 00:09:09.220
<v Speaker 2>And of course we also have the tariffs </v>
<v Speaker 2>tariffs.</v>

169
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:14.020
<v Speaker 2>They're like sniper bullets designed to </v>
<v Speaker 2>stop very specific products from getting</v>

170
00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.150
<v Speaker 2>into European markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

171
00:09:16.151 --> 00:09:19.570
<v Speaker 2>imagine that you are an Argentinian </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffee producer.</v>

172
00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:20.643
<v Speaker 2>If you want to sell your law coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>meaning you take it from the plant and </v>

173
00:09:24.011 --> 00:09:26.290
<v Speaker 2>the sellers Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they got no problem.</v>

174
00:09:26.350 --> 00:09:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Zero tariffs for you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And why is that?</v>

175
00:09:29.501 --> 00:09:30.334
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's because no European country grows </v>

176
00:09:32.141 --> 00:09:32.974
<v Speaker 2>coffee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but if you want to sell this coffee and </v>

177
00:09:35.111 --> 00:09:39.310
<v Speaker 2>it's already toasted and processed form,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well good luck to you.</v>

178
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:41.950
<v Speaker 2>You're going to have to pay a tariff of </v>
<v Speaker 2>7.5%</v>

179
00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.270
<v Speaker 2>and why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

180
00:09:43.271 --> 00:09:44.104
<v Speaker 2>because Europe has factories that </v>
<v Speaker 2>process and toast coffee and they just </v>

181
00:09:48.041 --> 00:09:53.041
<v Speaker 2>don't really like competition boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I knew what you're thinking right now.</v>

182
00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.520
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that evil European Union,</v>

183
00:09:57.521 --> 00:09:59.200
<v Speaker 2>that punishment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the third wells,</v>

184
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.130
<v Speaker 2>those Brussels bureaucrats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they just want to destroy free trade.</v>

185
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:04.363
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've actually got bad news for you </v>

186
00:10:05.021 --> 00:10:05.854
<v Speaker 2>because the reality is that every </v>
<v Speaker 2>country on the planet does the exact </v>

187
00:10:09.131 --> 00:10:10.270
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

188
00:10:10.271 --> 00:10:11.104
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe is actually one of the most open </v>

189
00:10:13.781 --> 00:10:14.614
<v Speaker 2>regions.</v>

190
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:19.393
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if the same farmer wants to sell his </v>

191
00:10:20.931 --> 00:10:21.764
<v Speaker 2>coffee in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's going to have to pay a 20% tariff </v>

192
00:10:25.460 --> 00:10:26.293
<v Speaker 2>if he wants to sell bananas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then he asked to pay between 40 and 50% </v>

193
00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.560
<v Speaker 2>depending on the season as what about </v>
<v Speaker 2>America is a land of the free?</v>

194
00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:35.990
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's actually kind of the same.</v>

195
00:10:35.991 --> 00:10:36.824
<v Speaker 2>There.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost no country is willing to leave </v>

196
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:45.780
<v Speaker 2>its farmers alone in order to compete </v>
<v Speaker 2>with fat competition.</v>

197
00:10:45.870 --> 00:10:50.160
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of this can change and why?</v>

198
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's have a look at that.</v>

199
00:10:56.550 --> 00:10:57.383
<v Speaker 2>At times for protectionism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every year Europe spends over $72 </v>

200
00:11:01.480 --> 00:11:03.550
<v Speaker 2>billion subsidizing its own farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's,</v>

201
00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:05.860
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not all the country.</v>

202
00:11:05.861 --> 00:11:10.240
<v Speaker 2>Then there's paid the same amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just have a look at this chart here.</v>

203
00:11:10.270 --> 00:11:14.560
<v Speaker 2>You can see the main contributors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the countries that pay more than</v>

204
00:11:14.561 --> 00:11:19.260
<v Speaker 2>what they get.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Surprise,</v>

205
00:11:19.261 --> 00:11:22.000
<v Speaker 2>surprise here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who is the third biggest caap nets?</v>

206
00:11:22.001 --> 00:11:23.130
<v Speaker 2>Congenita.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

207
00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.990
<v Speaker 2>of course that's the United Kingdom.</v>

208
00:11:27.250 --> 00:11:28.083
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

209
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:30.680
<v Speaker 2>Shane's at will no longer be a member of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the club.</v>

210
00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:31.693
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this leaves a whole of more than a 12 </v>

211
00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:35.353
<v Speaker 2>billion euros.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why many are suggesting that </v>

212
00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:37.993
<v Speaker 2>other countries have to start paying </v>
<v Speaker 2>more to keep the spending where it used </v>

213
00:11:40.581 --> 00:11:41.414
<v Speaker 2>to be.</v>

214
00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:45.073
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:50.290
<v Speaker 2>Pin Commission urges you countries to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pay more into budget nonetheless,</v>

216
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:51.183
<v Speaker 2>who really wants to pay more.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a time when you're a skeptic are </v>

217
00:11:53.621 --> 00:11:54.454
<v Speaker 2>stronger than ever and no politician can</v>
<v Speaker 2>really come back to his own country and </v>

218
00:11:57.401 --> 00:11:58.091
<v Speaker 2>say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hey,</v>

219
00:11:58.091 --> 00:11:59.620
<v Speaker 2>guess what guys?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without your wallet,</v>

220
00:11:59.621 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 2>because we got to pay more for being in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the EU.</v>

221
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:05.290
<v Speaker 2>It's not going to go down well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you do the math,</v>

222
00:12:05.291 --> 00:12:08.600
<v Speaker 2>you realize that there's only really one</v>
<v Speaker 2>option.</v>

223
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:11.700
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Musters plans.</v>

224
00:12:11.970 --> 00:12:12.803
<v Speaker 2>It's payments to Europe's biggest farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basically Europe hat to reduce the </v>

225
00:12:16.381 --> 00:12:17.214
<v Speaker 2>direct aid given to the farmers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And they've started with the wealthiest </v>

226
00:12:20.671 --> 00:12:23.250
<v Speaker 2>ones since they're the ones who needed </v>
<v Speaker 2>them the least.</v>

227
00:12:23.370 --> 00:12:27.480
<v Speaker 2>But the biggest surprise came with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Emmanuel macron speech.</v>

228
00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:28.373
<v Speaker 2>Everybody in Brussels might expect from </v>
<v Speaker 2>stupid come out as the biggest old </v>

229
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:33.180
<v Speaker 2>school crp supporter.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

230
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:34.790
<v Speaker 2>Let's mcallen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

231
00:12:34.830 --> 00:12:39.000
<v Speaker 2>he's got other priorities and this means</v>
<v Speaker 2>a green light to cut aid in the future.</v>

232
00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:41.750
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade deals being struck in fashion.</v>

233
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:45.993
<v Speaker 2>Ooh.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And Mexico agreed to new free trade </v>

234
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:49.150
<v Speaker 2>pact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

235
00:12:49.151 --> 00:12:49.984
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He has someone not only talking about </v>

236
00:12:50.861 --> 00:12:52.820
<v Speaker 2>Mexico here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean look at this new,</v>

237
00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:53.863
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

238
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:57.423
<v Speaker 2>pn union rush to promote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's preliminary free trade agreement </v>

239
00:12:59.711 --> 00:13:03.070
<v Speaker 2>with Japan by stressing the benefits for</v>
<v Speaker 2>you farmers.</v>

240
00:13:03.130 --> 00:13:04.750
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>stiff us slowly.</v>

241
00:13:04.751 --> 00:13:07.180
<v Speaker 2>The European Union is reducing </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies,</v>

242
00:13:07.181 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 2>reducing tariffs and getting rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>production quotas and I know what you're</v>

243
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:13.060
<v Speaker 2>probably thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're thinking,</v>

244
00:13:13.061 --> 00:13:13.871
<v Speaker 2>come on Simon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A,</v>

245
00:13:13.871 --> 00:13:17.470
<v Speaker 2>you're rarely telling us that brexit is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the only reason for this change.</v>

246
00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:18.531
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

247
00:13:18.531 --> 00:13:19.780
<v Speaker 2>I'm Saturday.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

248
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:20.623
<v Speaker 2>there are two other important reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand is European agriculture </v>

249
00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:25.800
<v Speaker 2>is already more productive than </v>
<v Speaker 2>elsewhere.</v>

250
00:13:26.270 --> 00:13:27.103
<v Speaker 2>This video we told you about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands being one of the biggest </v>

251
00:13:29.751 --> 00:13:31.610
<v Speaker 2>agricultural powerhouses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

252
00:13:31.611 --> 00:13:34.340
<v Speaker 2>they have what we call the food silicon </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>

253
00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

254
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:38.513
<v Speaker 2>In fact is of bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She is or Ribera del Duero wine can be </v>

255
00:13:40.701 --> 00:13:44.150
<v Speaker 2>found almost everywhere and they all </v>
<v Speaker 2>come from Europe.</v>

256
00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:45.180
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a,</v>

257
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:47.260
<v Speaker 2>doesn't need to protect its own markets </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore,</v>

258
00:13:47.270 --> 00:13:48.103
<v Speaker 2>but instead sign lots of trade deals and</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know what you might be thinking right </v>

259
00:13:52.401 --> 00:13:53.234
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll farmers be happy when they stop </v>

260
00:13:55.370 --> 00:13:57.920
<v Speaker 2>getting all of these subsidies from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Brussels.</v>

261
00:13:58.310 --> 00:14:00.770
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the reality is no,</v>

262
00:14:00.830 --> 00:14:03.740
<v Speaker 2>but the question really is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does actually matter.</v>

263
00:14:03.830 --> 00:14:05.120
<v Speaker 2>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>peasants unions,</v>

264
00:14:05.121 --> 00:14:05.954
<v Speaker 2>they used to have a big political grip </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the 60s when the goal was the </v>

265
00:14:09.441 --> 00:14:12.320
<v Speaker 2>French president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>France had millions of people working in</v>

266
00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:14.440
<v Speaker 2>the primary sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now their ons,</v>

267
00:14:14.450 --> 00:14:15.283
<v Speaker 2>even 3% of the population working there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means way less political sway and </v>

268
00:14:19.401 --> 00:14:21.140
<v Speaker 2>weighed us votes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But not only that,</v>

269
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.780
<v Speaker 2>who do you think these European farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>vote for?</v>

270
00:14:27.460 --> 00:14:30.280
<v Speaker 2>Francis disillusioned farmers turn to Le</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pen.</v>

271
00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.233
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically the biggest place for </v>

272
00:14:32.621 --> 00:14:37.420
<v Speaker 2>euroskeptic parties to get their votes </v>
<v Speaker 2>are rural areas where farmers live.</v>

273
00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:40.540
<v Speaker 2>So if you're a European politician and </v>
<v Speaker 2>he wants to make your vote as happy,</v>

274
00:14:40.550 --> 00:14:41.383
<v Speaker 2>you're really kind of do want to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>more attention to the urban europeanist </v>

275
00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:49.320
<v Speaker 2>voters instead of the rural euro skeptic</v>
<v Speaker 2>ones and come on now because the average</v>

276
00:14:49.331 --> 00:14:52.350
<v Speaker 2>city guy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they don't know what the caap even.</v>

277
00:14:52.351 --> 00:14:52.490
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

278
00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.323
<v Speaker 1>Is,</v>

279
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:58.910
<v Speaker 2>and this leads us to our question for </v>
<v Speaker 2>you.</v>

280
00:14:58.911 --> 00:15:02.600
<v Speaker 2>Does the CAAP have any future whatsoever</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Europe?</v>

281
00:15:02.601 --> 00:15:03.434
<v Speaker 2>Will we see greater liberalization of </v>
<v Speaker 2>agriculture in Europe as well as the </v>

282
00:15:06.321 --> 00:15:07.520
<v Speaker 2>rest of the world?</v>
