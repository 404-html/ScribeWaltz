1
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:10.193
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is perhaps the most emetic </v>
<v Speaker 1>closed off and isolated country on the </v>

2
00:00:13.141 --> 00:00:13.974
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can you that now in 2018 it seems to </v>

3
00:00:16.021 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 1>be living in 1960</v>

4
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.293
<v Speaker 2>hello</v>

5
00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:28.153
<v Speaker 1>the now this entire store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might be about to change here and </v>

6
00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:31.154
<v Speaker 1>there's your politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've already talked about how </v>

7
00:00:32.481 --> 00:00:36.350
<v Speaker 1>capitalism is reaching North Korea by </v>
<v Speaker 1>following popular markets.</v>

8
00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.213
<v Speaker 1>How can entire entrepreneurial </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution is taking place and how </v>

9
00:00:39.921 --> 00:00:40.754
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then at 50% of North Koreans to </v>

10
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.720
<v Speaker 1>make a living from the private economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

11
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.940
<v Speaker 1>a couple of questions remains on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table.</v>

12
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:47.803
<v Speaker 1>What does one of the most totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments on the planet think about </v>

13
00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>this particular capitalist revolution?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are his plans and other very,</v>

14
00:00:54.621 --> 00:00:55.454
<v Speaker 1>very important question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who the hell would be willing to invest </v>

15
00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.000
<v Speaker 1>in North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:59.001 --> 00:00:59.834
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>

17
00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.573
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

18
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.100
<v Speaker 3>Views aren't the best of times.</v>

19
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.323
<v Speaker 1>On June the 12th 2018 historic in </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting was held in Singapore for the </v>

20
00:01:16.721 --> 00:01:18.790
<v Speaker 1>first time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>TheU s presidents in this case,</v>

21
00:01:18.791 --> 00:01:23.791
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump mess within North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

22
00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:27.543
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly this was to d nuclearized </v>

23
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.960
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

24
00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:30.793
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.630
<v Speaker 1>The actual goal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well in addition seem taking a couple of</v>

26
00:01:37.631 --> 00:01:38.290
<v Speaker 1>pictures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

27
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.123
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pictures never hurts because the idea </v>

28
00:01:40.061 --> 00:01:40.894
<v Speaker 1>was to start a dialogue and cool down </v>
<v Speaker 1>the enormous tension that had been </v>

29
00:01:43.301 --> 00:01:44.134
<v Speaker 1>growing between the two countries and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for North Korea from continuing with a </v>

30
00:01:46.811 --> 00:01:47.644
<v Speaker 1>nuclear program that could have given it</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to attack even the United </v>

31
00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:51.760
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well hold on a minute because you know,</v>

32
00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:54.130
<v Speaker 1>one the things theory and another thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is truth.</v>

33
00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.750
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out the latest news.</v>

34
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

35
00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:58.283
<v Speaker 3>West spy agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea is now working on new </v>

36
00:02:01.111 --> 00:02:06.111
<v Speaker 3>missile secretary of state.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Mike Palm Peo acknowledged during Senate</v>

37
00:02:06.461 --> 00:02:11.461
<v Speaker 3>testimony that North Korea factories </v>
<v Speaker 3>continue to produce facade material used</v>

38
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:12.820
<v Speaker 3>in making nuclear weapons.</v>

39
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.910
<v Speaker 1>And nowadays as we told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you hear on visual politic,</v>

40
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:21.773
<v Speaker 1>it seems very difficult for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang regime to agree at least in </v>

41
00:02:24.301 --> 00:02:26.520
<v Speaker 1>the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get rid of its nuclear weapons,</v>

42
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:29.190
<v Speaker 1>which are after all of that best life </v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance.</v>

43
00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.053
<v Speaker 1>But of course that doesn't mean they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't accept to making concessions to </v>

44
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.693
<v Speaker 1>normalize their relations with the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the welds and ends the international </v>

45
00:02:35.341 --> 00:02:36.174
<v Speaker 1>sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because you see since Kim Jong Un came </v>

46
00:02:37.561 --> 00:02:38.394
<v Speaker 1>to power in 2011 he said two priorities </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand develop a nuclear bomb </v>

47
00:02:42.211 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>and on the other something far less </v>
<v Speaker 1>sinister reforming the economy.</v>

48
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.120
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you heard that right.</v>

49
00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.983
<v Speaker 1>Although it seems hard to believe one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the objectives that Kim Jong own vet </v>

50
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:52.284
<v Speaker 1>North Korean dictator has set himself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>to change his country's bad economic </v>

51
00:02:55.231 --> 00:02:56.064
<v Speaker 1>situation by copying or some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes that have taken place in </v>

52
00:02:58.411 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>countries like China and Vietnam this </v>
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>

53
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.193
<v Speaker 1>Once they develop their nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities Pyongyang's number one </v>

54
00:03:06.671 --> 00:03:10.690
<v Speaker 1>priority is precisely this to advance in</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development.</v>

55
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:11.613
<v Speaker 1>Of course to achieve this they need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>end international sanctions which are </v>

56
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.630
<v Speaker 1>causing enormous damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

57
00:03:16.631 --> 00:03:17.464
<v Speaker 1>we'll see how that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may seem hard to believe North Korea </v>

58
00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>situation could get even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

59
00:03:21.401 --> 00:03:23.710
<v Speaker 1>between the sanctions and the sinking of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

60
00:03:23.711 --> 00:03:24.544
<v Speaker 1>one of the few countries that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>aligned itself with North Korea </v>

61
00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.180
<v Speaker 1>relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have collapsed,</v>

62
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.080
<v Speaker 1>but of course when we talk about North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea in the economy,</v>

63
00:03:38.081 --> 00:03:38.914
<v Speaker 1>we need to talk about China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of all North Korean trade and </v>

64
00:03:41.471 --> 00:03:42.304
<v Speaker 1>foreign exchange occurs here and once </v>
<v Speaker 1>that happened is that China has been </v>

65
00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>pushing Pyongyang for years to get some </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms going once and for all.</v>

66
00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.010
<v Speaker 1>And since those changes have been slower</v>
<v Speaker 1>than a total with rheumatism,</v>

67
00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.890
<v Speaker 1>well last year Beijing decided to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>applying international sanctions.</v>

68
00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:57.783
<v Speaker 1>This is what was happening in August of </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 China to implement UN sanctions on </v>

69
00:04:03.491 --> 00:04:08.491
<v Speaker 1>North Korea trying to band North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron lead and coal imports as part of UN</v>

70
00:04:09.161 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

71
00:04:10.661 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>considering the enormous dependence that</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has on China,</v>

72
00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:15.033
<v Speaker 1>this has been a disaster.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just in the first six months of 2018 </v>

73
00:04:21.221 --> 00:04:24.970
<v Speaker 1>Chinese purchases of North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>products have plummeted by more than 90%</v>

74
00:04:24.971 --> 00:04:29.971
<v Speaker 1>of Chinese exports to North Korea by 40%</v>
<v Speaker 1>this of course is in the official market</v>

75
00:04:32.571 --> 00:04:34.740
<v Speaker 1>and as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a parallel market,</v>

76
00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the black market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's an entirely different story.</v>

77
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:40.363
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that all this has led North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea and industrial and mining </v>

78
00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:43.724
<v Speaker 1>production to go through its worst time </v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years as if we had the </v>

79
00:04:48.591 --> 00:04:49.424
<v Speaker 1>disastrous state of the country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure to all of this with our </v>

80
00:04:52.171 --> 00:04:55.220
<v Speaker 1>continuous black,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than a thousand kilometers of paved</v>

81
00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:56.870
<v Speaker 1>roads throughout the country and to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to crap.</v>

82
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:57.713
<v Speaker 1>It trains that in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't go over 20 kilometers or 12 miles </v>

83
00:05:00.351 --> 00:05:01.184
<v Speaker 1>per hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clear that this country urgently </v>

84
00:05:02.631 --> 00:05:05.630
<v Speaker 1>needs a 180 degree turn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what's,</v>

85
00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.190
<v Speaker 1>they also know that in Pyongyang.</v>

86
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.273
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

87
00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.320
<v Speaker 1>Ken,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea become the new Vietnam.</v>

88
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.860
<v Speaker 1>In 1986 Vietnam launched the well known </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dorothy Moye policy,</v>

89
00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.830
<v Speaker 1>a set of economic reforms similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those of den Shao Ping and China.</v>

90
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.940
<v Speaker 1>These had the mission of setting </v>
<v Speaker 1>communism aside.</v>

91
00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:34.050
<v Speaker 1>In order to jumpstart a market economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve this,</v>

92
00:05:34.241 --> 00:05:36.460
<v Speaker 1>agricultural cooperatives were </v>
<v Speaker 1>dissolved.</v>

93
00:05:36.461 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>Price controls were eliminated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>land ownership was allowed,</v>

94
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:42.130
<v Speaker 1>and policies were put in place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract foreign investment.</v>

95
00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 1>So what was the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While over the following 30 years,</v>

96
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:49.810
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam economy grew at an average </v>
<v Speaker 1>annual rate of almost 7% today,</v>

97
00:05:49.811 --> 00:05:50.644
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam is transforming at a break,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neck speed and its exports are or any </v>

98
00:05:53.771 --> 00:05:56.620
<v Speaker 1>larger than those of countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil or Australia.</v>

99
00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

100
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:06.583
<v Speaker 1>at the last into Korean summit in April </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Kim Jong Un's the president of </v>

101
00:06:09.861 --> 00:06:10.694
<v Speaker 1>South Korea Moon Gin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the North Korean leader expressed an </v>

102
00:06:13.071 --> 00:06:16.460
<v Speaker 1>interest in following the model of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam and following this line,</v>

103
00:06:16.461 --> 00:06:17.294
<v Speaker 1>the North Korean government has approved</v>
<v Speaker 1>some significant measures in recent </v>

104
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:21.021
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

105
00:06:21.021 --> 00:06:21.854
<v Speaker 1>and it has promoted the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>private markets has given more autonomy </v>

106
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.430
<v Speaker 1>to public companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does granted land parcels to peasants</v>

107
00:06:28.431 --> 00:06:30.140
<v Speaker 1>for private exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

108
00:06:30.141 --> 00:06:33.110
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two questions which we need to</v>

109
00:06:33.111 --> 00:06:33.921
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He won't.</v>

110
00:06:33.921 --> 00:06:34.754
<v Speaker 1>Earth would be willing to invest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea and what else is the </v>

111
00:06:36.951 --> 00:06:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang government willing to do?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen up.</v>

112
00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:48.603
<v Speaker 1>Would invest in North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were asked which countries you </v>

113
00:06:52.931 --> 00:06:53.764
<v Speaker 1>would like to do business in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea would probably be one of </v>

114
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:56.824
<v Speaker 1>your last options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investing in such a totalitarian comes </v>

115
00:06:59.061 --> 00:07:01.030
<v Speaker 1>from where the leader makes and unmixed </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

116
00:07:01.031 --> 00:07:01.864
<v Speaker 1>At will where the government Daggett's </v>
<v Speaker 1>with brutality and dedicates itself to </v>

117
00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:07.540
<v Speaker 1>threatening the rest of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Investing in a country where the rule of</v>

118
00:07:07.541 --> 00:07:10.150
<v Speaker 1>law and legal security is pure fantasy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

119
00:07:10.151 --> 00:07:10.984
<v Speaker 1>come on while folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is they're not everyone sees </v>

120
00:07:12.971 --> 00:07:13.804
<v Speaker 1>it this way.</v>

121
00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:16.870
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

122
00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:17.703
<v Speaker 1>See some of South Korea is the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>company is such as high on dye lot </v>

123
00:07:19.891 --> 00:07:20.724
<v Speaker 1>cooperation and Samsung have already set</v>
<v Speaker 1>up work groups to investigate and </v>

124
00:07:24.061 --> 00:07:24.894
<v Speaker 1>analyze the potential business </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities in North Korea and </v>

125
00:07:27.091 --> 00:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>according to polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of South Korean companies</v>

126
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:30.744
<v Speaker 1>would be willing to do business in North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea if sanctions were lifted high on </v>

127
00:07:33.931 --> 00:07:34.711
<v Speaker 1>day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

128
00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:35.544
<v Speaker 1>is already preparing an early reopening </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the industrial case on zone and </v>

129
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:40.830
<v Speaker 1>industrial saying next to the border of </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea.</v>

130
00:07:40.831 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 1>That was created in 2004 to how's </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies,</v>

131
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.560
<v Speaker 1>mainly South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which employs more than 80,000</v>

132
00:07:46.561 --> 00:07:47.394
<v Speaker 1>North Koreans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But in 2013 given the growing tensions </v>

133
00:07:49.891 --> 00:07:50.724
<v Speaker 1>between the two careers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was closed by the Pyongyang </v>

134
00:07:52.441 --> 00:07:56.370
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even recently,</v>

135
00:07:56.371 --> 00:07:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Jim Rogers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important and well known</v>

136
00:07:58.741 --> 00:07:59.574
<v Speaker 1>investors of all time has lamented the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that the United States doesn't </v>

137
00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:06.330
<v Speaker 1>allow him to invest in North Korea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>just made statements such as these</v>

138
00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.470
<v Speaker 3>Korea is now going to be the most </v>
<v Speaker 3>exciting country in the world.</v>

139
00:08:10.650 --> 00:08:14.580
<v Speaker 3>Kim Jong Goon does not want war.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Kim is not North Korean.</v>

140
00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:15.443
<v Speaker 3>He was educated in Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He knows there's a different world out </v>

141
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:19.770
<v Speaker 3>there.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They need everything electricity,</v>

142
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:22.980
<v Speaker 3>so tablecloths,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if you've got any kind of expertise,</v>

143
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:25.530
<v Speaker 3>you're going to make a fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Jim Rogers,</v>

144
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.523
<v Speaker 1>but the holy Roman just amendment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question we have to ask ourselves </v>

145
00:08:28.811 --> 00:08:29.171
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:08:29.171 --> 00:08:32.140
<v Speaker 1>what the hell do they see in a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>like North Korea?</v>

147
00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally they see opportunities.</v>

148
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:41.710
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has a very young,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's very entrepreneurial population</v>

149
00:08:41.711 --> 00:08:43.780
<v Speaker 1>with low labor costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

150
00:08:43.781 --> 00:08:44.614
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to be quite rich and net for </v>

151
00:08:45.731 --> 00:08:46.840
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got gold,</v>

152
00:08:46.841 --> 00:08:47.561
<v Speaker 1>zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>copper,</v>

153
00:08:47.561 --> 00:08:48.394
<v Speaker 1>and rare earth elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The estimate of value of all of these </v>

154
00:08:50.111 --> 00:08:55.111
<v Speaker 1>minerals could be more than $6 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Jim Rogers says,</v>

155
00:08:57.900 --> 00:09:01.170
<v Speaker 1>the country is still being built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs everything.</v>

156
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:02.093
<v Speaker 1>And if that wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also located between two economic </v>

157
00:09:04.381 --> 00:09:06.060
<v Speaker 1>powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and South Korea.</v>

158
00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>You see it the last Inter Korean summit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the South Korean president gave Kim</v>

159
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:13.200
<v Speaker 1>Jong a pen drive that included lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the investments that South Korea we'd be</v>

160
00:09:13.201 --> 00:09:14.034
<v Speaker 1>willing to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what investments would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>included on this 10 drive?</v>

162
00:09:18.700 --> 00:09:19.533
<v Speaker 1>Well sold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll be very interested in building </v>

163
00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:21.394
<v Speaker 1>trends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean railroads that in addition to </v>

164
00:09:22.571 --> 00:09:23.404
<v Speaker 1>boosting the North Korean economy would </v>
<v Speaker 1>allow South Korea to export goods much </v>

165
00:09:26.291 --> 00:09:28.900
<v Speaker 1>more quickly to China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's the same story with roads,</v>

166
00:09:28.901 --> 00:09:30.100
<v Speaker 1>all pipelines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

167
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:30.963
<v Speaker 1>These would be billion dollar plans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course not everything is so simple </v>

168
00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:41.800
<v Speaker 1>and enthusiasm is far from widespread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is a brutal dictatorship.</v>

169
00:09:41.801 --> 00:09:45.340
<v Speaker 1>Corruption is huge and the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>can do literally whatever it wants.</v>

170
00:09:45.370 --> 00:09:47.040
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can expropriate.</v>

171
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.470
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

172
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.853
<v Speaker 3>is where the money is to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you can figure out how to not get </v>

173
00:10:00.251 --> 00:10:01.084
<v Speaker 3>expropriated,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Justin Hastings and associate professor </v>

174
00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:04.840
<v Speaker 3>at the University of Sydney,</v>

175
00:10:04.930 --> 00:10:09.100
<v Speaker 1>and then of course there's the issue of </v>
<v Speaker 1>international sanctions as a consequence</v>

176
00:10:09.101 --> 00:10:12.280
<v Speaker 1>of their nuclear program and until those</v>
<v Speaker 1>are lifted any change,</v>

177
00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.143
<v Speaker 1>it's going to have a very short run.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it's precisely at this point that </v>

178
00:10:15.431 --> 00:10:17.560
<v Speaker 1>China can play a very important role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You See,</v>

179
00:10:17.610 --> 00:10:21.310
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping has managed to do what </v>
<v Speaker 1>China's been planning for years,</v>

180
00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:22.173
<v Speaker 1>getting Qian Yang going,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could obviously mean a lot of big </v>

181
00:10:24.281 --> 00:10:25.114
<v Speaker 1>business with Chinese companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we now see headlines like </v>

182
00:10:27.731 --> 00:10:28.564
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

183
00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:34.250
<v Speaker 3>China suggests sanctions relief for </v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea after trump Kim summit,</v>

184
00:10:34.410 --> 00:10:35.243
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has allowed the black markets </v>

185
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.463
<v Speaker 1>between both countries to flourish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's accelerated the development plans </v>

186
00:10:40.291 --> 00:10:43.920
<v Speaker 1>in the border area and is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>studying the eminence opening of special</v>

187
00:10:43.921 --> 00:10:46.830
<v Speaker 1>economic zones on the North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>border and then there's tourism,</v>

188
00:10:46.831 --> 00:10:48.720
<v Speaker 1>which is one of Kim Jong Un's </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

189
00:10:48.721 --> 00:10:50.340
<v Speaker 1>Greatest priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen Up,</v>

190
00:10:56.690 --> 00:10:56.980
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

191
00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:57.813
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A holiday spot was the arrival of </v>

192
00:11:01.081 --> 00:11:04.860
<v Speaker 1>Chinese tourists has continued in recent</v>
<v Speaker 1>years and since May,</v>

193
00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:06.990
<v Speaker 1>2018 the number of daily arrivals is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than doubled.</v>

194
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:08.803
<v Speaker 3>You're going to run at least seven or </v>
<v Speaker 3>eight tour routes to North Korea this </v>

195
00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:12.703
<v Speaker 3>year,</v>
<v Speaker 3>including a one day tour to nano and a </v>

196
00:11:14.811 --> 00:11:19.811
<v Speaker 3>trip of four to five days to Pyongyang.</v>
<v Speaker 3>K Song and Pawn Joan changing it.</v>

197
00:11:20.151 --> 00:11:22.850
<v Speaker 3>Deputy manager of a Chinese travel </v>
<v Speaker 3>company.</v>

198
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.773
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tourism is precisely one of the </v>

199
00:11:24.681 --> 00:11:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang government's top priorities </v>
<v Speaker 1>for several reasons.</v>

200
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.420
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it generates employment.</v>

201
00:11:29.490 --> 00:11:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a very labor intensive Saxa.</v>

202
00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.660
<v Speaker 1>It also attracts investments that helps </v>
<v Speaker 1>obtain foreign currency very quick.</v>

203
00:11:35.710 --> 00:11:40.290
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other</v>

204
00:11:40.290 --> 00:11:41.123
<v Speaker 1>hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tourism could change the regimes image </v>

205
00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.793
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that swapping nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>parades and nuclear threats with exotic </v>

206
00:11:46.591 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>beaches and seaside dinners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be good for business.</v>

207
00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Do you do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 the Korean government created </v>

208
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:52.704
<v Speaker 1>these special tourist of one son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a special economic zone where foreign </v>

209
00:11:55.601 --> 00:11:56.434
<v Speaker 1>investment is allowed and where in </v>
<v Speaker 1>principle the regime would allow more </v>

210
00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:00.880
<v Speaker 1>freedom for developing tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

211
00:12:00.881 --> 00:12:05.320
<v Speaker 1>this is the same area where until </v>
<v Speaker 1>recently the army did things like this.</v>

212
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:06.213
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea and things is that with the </v>

213
00:12:20.911 --> 00:12:24.240
<v Speaker 1>nuclear program and the sanctions </v>
<v Speaker 1>results have been very scarce.</v>

214
00:12:24.270 --> 00:12:25.260
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Un,</v>

215
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.690
<v Speaker 1>he wants to step on the gas without </v>
<v Speaker 1>going any further.</v>

216
00:12:27.691 --> 00:12:31.020
<v Speaker 1>In 2017 the North Korean governments and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to delegation to Spain,</v>

217
00:12:31.021 --> 00:12:31.854
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the major tourist powers</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world in order to check out </v>

218
00:12:34.231 --> 00:12:36.540
<v Speaker 1>places and like panadol more marina </v>
<v Speaker 1>d'or.</v>

219
00:12:36.650 --> 00:12:39.900
<v Speaker 1>The idea was that this delegation would </v>
<v Speaker 1>learn from them and get some ideas.</v>

220
00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.840
<v Speaker 1>Apparently Pyongyang's goal is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract more than 1 million tourists per</v>

221
00:12:46.841 --> 00:12:50.440
<v Speaker 1>year in the short term and five to 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million more in the foreseeable future.</v>

222
00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:53.590
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will Kim Jong really be willing to carry</v>

223
00:12:53.591 --> 00:12:54.424
<v Speaker 1>out all of the reforms that the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to get these plans to come to </v>

224
00:12:57.281 --> 00:12:58.001
<v Speaker 1>life?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:12:58.001 --> 00:12:58.834
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only the future going to be able to </v>

226
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:00.574
<v Speaker 1>answer that question for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What seems clear is that we have the </v>

227
00:13:02.081 --> 00:13:05.110
<v Speaker 1>best opportunity to leave the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean nightmare behind,</v>

228
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:07.690
<v Speaker 1>which isn't only a threat to the rest of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's best.</v>

229
00:13:07.691 --> 00:13:08.524
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a punishments and to great prison </v>

230
00:13:10.091 --> 00:13:12.790
<v Speaker 1>of fear and repression for the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Koreans themselves.</v>

231
00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.653
<v Speaker 1>But now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are you in favor of lifting sanctions </v>

232
00:13:15.851 --> 00:13:16.684
<v Speaker 1>against North Korea?</v>
