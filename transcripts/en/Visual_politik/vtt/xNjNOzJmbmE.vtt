00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:08.923
<v Speaker 2>a lot of people are wondering these days</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's possible to put the word </v>

3
00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.133
<v Speaker 2>Islam in the same sentence as democracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and human rights and to tell you the </v>

4
00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:16.964
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if there are not that many examples to </v>

5
00:00:18.231 --> 00:00:21.380
<v Speaker 2>be optimistic about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in a country like Turkey where they</v>

6
00:00:21.381 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 2>have a guarantee of the separation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>church and state,</v>

7
00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.490
<v Speaker 2>they are still moving towards and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islamic theocracy.</v>

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.443
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is one country that is escaping </v>

9
00:00:31.581 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 2>this trends and that country is too,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

10
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.463
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

11
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:39.333
<v Speaker 2>Smith 10 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tunisia is the cradle of the so called </v>

12
00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.253
<v Speaker 2>Arab spring.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know that phenomena that started in </v>

13
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:46.894
<v Speaker 2>the winter of 2011 anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is where everything started and </v>

14
00:00:49.991 --> 00:00:54.250
<v Speaker 2>more specifically things started in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city of city Bosiat it things kicked off</v>

15
00:00:54.251 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 2>when a 26 year old fruit seller burned </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself to death as a form of protest in</v>

16
00:00:58.271 --> 00:00:59.104
<v Speaker 2>front of a government building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how a revolution spread all </v>

17
00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 2>across northern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

18
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.923
<v Speaker 1>I forgot.</v>

19
00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.760
<v Speaker 2>And from here you probably do know the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the story.</v>

20
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.653
<v Speaker 2>In Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they overthrew their dictator only for </v>

21
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:14.070
<v Speaker 2>him to be replaced by a man who is </v>
<v Speaker 2>probably even worse.</v>

22
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.933
<v Speaker 2>Libya is a failed state that has a high </v>
<v Speaker 2>probability of becoming a radical </v>

23
00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:19.920
<v Speaker 2>Islamic country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as well,</v>

24
00:01:19.921 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 2>let's just say it's probably best that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we don't talk about Syria.</v>

25
00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:24.720
<v Speaker 2>Among all of this madness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

26
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.240
<v Speaker 2>Tunusia is an exception after rounds </v>
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>

27
00:01:27.241 --> 00:01:28.380
<v Speaker 2>Their dictator,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Aberdeen,</v>

28
00:01:28.381 --> 00:01:31.410
<v Speaker 2>Ben Ali Dune is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ian's wrote a brand's new constitution,</v>

29
00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:34.260
<v Speaker 2>which was inspired by French law.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This new tanks.</v>

30
00:01:34.261 --> 00:01:37.140
<v Speaker 2>It allows freedom of speech and freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>of religion,</v>

31
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.033
<v Speaker 2>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now 20% of the country's parliamentary </v>

32
00:01:40.201 --> 00:01:41.034
<v Speaker 2>seats are occupied by women.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a very big achievement if you </v>

33
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:46.380
<v Speaker 2>consider to nausea to any other Islamic</v>

34
00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:47.293
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

35
00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.330
<v Speaker 2>why Tunisia has become one of the main </v>
<v Speaker 2>targets of Dash.</v>

36
00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.193
<v Speaker 2>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 73 people have died in three </v>

37
00:01:55.971 --> 00:01:56.804
<v Speaker 2>separate terrorist attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is what leads us to many </v>

38
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:00.770
<v Speaker 2>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cantonese,</v>

39
00:02:00.771 --> 00:02:03.980
<v Speaker 2>he and liberal democracy survive in such</v>
<v Speaker 2>a harsh environment.</v>

40
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 2>Can tunusia become a model for </v>
<v Speaker 2>neighboring countries?</v>

41
00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 2>Will the European Union help or damage </v>
<v Speaker 2>this democracy?</v>

42
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.903
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we are going to answer all of </v>

43
00:02:11.841 --> 00:02:12.674
<v Speaker 2>these questions for you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but first we need to look a bit at the </v>

44
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:15.950
<v Speaker 2>history of tuners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

45
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.633
<v Speaker 2>lights and shadows of abby met Ben </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] in 1955 at Tunusia got its </v>

46
00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:27.860
<v Speaker 2>independence from France just like other</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the region,</v>

47
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.920
<v Speaker 2>the Republic of [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called Arab socialism or Pan Arab</v>

48
00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.913
<v Speaker 2>Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was an ideological cocktail that </v>

49
00:02:35.301 --> 00:02:38.150
<v Speaker 2>mixed authoritarianism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>charismatic leaders,</v>

50
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.750
<v Speaker 2>a centralized economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and finally a secular state.</v>

51
00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.510
<v Speaker 2>You might to even say it's an anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>religious state.</v>

52
00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.190
<v Speaker 2>This ideology became very fashionable in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the area that brought as tyrants,</v>

53
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:51.140
<v Speaker 2>such as Gaddafi in Libya and NASA in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt.</v>

54
00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:57.760
<v Speaker 2>In the Tennessean case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man is the man you are seeing on the</v>

55
00:02:57.761 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 2>screen now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His name was happy,</v>

56
00:02:59.741 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 2>but Bourguiba in summary has government </v>
<v Speaker 2>was famous for its corruption.</v>

57
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:04.353
<v Speaker 2>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has government was famous for its </v>

58
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:06.334
<v Speaker 2>corruption clientelism and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>systematic devaluations of the national </v>

59
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:11.200
<v Speaker 2>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dinner.</v>

60
00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.410
<v Speaker 2>It's really no wonder that the economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>eventually collapsed.</v>

61
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.520
<v Speaker 2>And so what was the outcome?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well in 1987 presidents Bourguiba was it</v>

62
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:20.590
<v Speaker 2>the hospital recovering from a heart </v>
<v Speaker 2>attack?</v>

63
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>It was at this point to that is prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>minister Aberdeen.</v>

64
00:03:22.841 --> 00:03:23.674
<v Speaker 2>Ben Ali took his seat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>June is Ian's called this events the </v>

65
00:03:25.691 --> 00:03:26.524
<v Speaker 2>medical cute Atar.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No blood was spills and actually there </v>

66
00:03:28.661 --> 00:03:32.200
<v Speaker 2>was no violence whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even when Bourguiba left the hospital,</v>

67
00:03:32.201 --> 00:03:33.034
<v Speaker 2>Ben Ali sent into a luxury mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a team of doctors and nurses to </v>

68
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.084
<v Speaker 2>take care of him.</v>

69
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.440
<v Speaker 2>Legend even says that he went to visit </v>
<v Speaker 2>the man often.</v>

70
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.100
<v Speaker 2>So you can see that this was a coup </v>
<v Speaker 2>guitar,</v>

71
00:03:46.101 --> 00:03:49.200
<v Speaker 2>but you can see that it was one with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of love and care.</v>

72
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 2>So what did Ben Ali do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

73
00:03:51.361 --> 00:03:54.510
<v Speaker 2>during his mandate,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he sent that he would bring democracy to</v>

74
00:03:54.511 --> 00:03:58.080
<v Speaker 2>Tunisia and while he did cool for </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections several times,</v>

75
00:03:58.081 --> 00:04:00.960
<v Speaker 2>the problem was that in order to run in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the elections,</v>

76
00:04:00.961 --> 00:04:05.310
<v Speaker 2>you needed the approval of 30 people </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the existing government party.</v>

77
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.490
<v Speaker 2>This means that in most of the cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well surprise,</v>

78
00:04:08.491 --> 00:04:09.324
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only eligible candidates was one </v>

79
00:04:11.431 --> 00:04:12.264
<v Speaker 2>from the government.</v>

80
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:17.813
<v Speaker 1>Thanks</v>

81
00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.660
<v Speaker 2>soul of this Ben Ali Hell's power for 23</v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

82
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.583
<v Speaker 2>23 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That of course continued the tradition </v>

83
00:04:24.331 --> 00:04:26.700
<v Speaker 2>of corruption that the tune is Ian.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People have grown,</v>

84
00:04:26.701 --> 00:04:27.534
<v Speaker 2>used to,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now there is something positive we </v>

85
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:30.054
<v Speaker 2>should say about Mr Ben Ali and that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>his economic practice from the stars of </v>

86
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.254
<v Speaker 2>this rule.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He encouraged foreign investment in </v>

87
00:04:39.581 --> 00:04:40.414
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>encouraged a loss of foreign companies </v>

88
00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:42.394
<v Speaker 2>to establish themselves in Tunisia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how several hotel chain started </v>

89
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:47.950
<v Speaker 2>up in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You attracted by the great weather.</v>

90
00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.873
<v Speaker 2>This led to tourism becoming tuners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He main industry followed by the olive </v>

91
00:04:52.301 --> 00:04:53.134
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And don't forget the latter of those </v>

92
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 2>because we're going to be coming back to</v>
<v Speaker 2>it shortly.</v>

93
00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:57.033
<v Speaker 2>So during those 20 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tennesseans actually managed to </v>

94
00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.530
<v Speaker 2>multiplying the income by three.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

95
00:05:02.531 --> 00:05:06.400
<v Speaker 2>in 2010 Tunusia boasted over 6 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>tourists.</v>

96
00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.610
<v Speaker 1>This is about half</v>

97
00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.220
<v Speaker 2>the number who visited neighboring </v>
<v Speaker 2>Egypt's bar to do.</v>

98
00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:17.054
<v Speaker 2>Keep in mind here that Egypt has,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well the pyramids and also where </v>

99
00:05:19.401 --> 00:05:21.980
<v Speaker 2>population nine times the size of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tunisia.</v>

100
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.750
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>close attention to the numbers here.</v>

101
00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.753
<v Speaker 2>Tunusia has a population of 10 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and in a single year they hosted </v>

102
00:05:29.871 --> 00:05:30.704
<v Speaker 2>6 million tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why am I emphasizing this quite so </v>

103
00:05:33.771 --> 00:05:34.520
<v Speaker 2>much?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

104
00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.270
<v Speaker 2>that's because tourists are much more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than an influx of money for the country.</v>

105
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.610
<v Speaker 2>They also bring with them another </v>
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>

106
00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:43.160
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly in a country which is majority </v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam,</v>

107
00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:43.994
<v Speaker 2>it becomes normal for people to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>women walking around without scarves on </v>

108
00:05:46.551 --> 00:05:47.384
<v Speaker 2>their heads.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I miss actual people to be seen </v>

109
00:05:48.651 --> 00:05:51.470
<v Speaker 2>kissing in the streets and for people to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be drinking alcohol.</v>

110
00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.333
<v Speaker 2>There is no other Islamic country that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is quite so exposed to this level of </v>

111
00:05:55.371 --> 00:05:56.204
<v Speaker 2>western culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you aren't one of those British </v>

112
00:05:57.831 --> 00:05:58.664
<v Speaker 2>people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've got drunk in 18 izzy and hotel </v>

113
00:05:59.931 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 2>well knew that you're doing your part </v>
<v Speaker 2>for Tunez cultural diversity.</v>

114
00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:06.470
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to this wider cultural exposure,</v>

115
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 2>something quite extraordinary happened.</v>

116
00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.060
<v Speaker 2>Craddick transition in Tunisia in 2010 </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Tennessean economy,</v>

117
00:06:16.061 --> 00:06:16.894
<v Speaker 2>it was on fire,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the unemployment rate was 12% added </v>

118
00:06:20.351 --> 00:06:21.184
<v Speaker 2>to this word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption scandals and power abuses </v>

119
00:06:23.321 --> 00:06:24.580
<v Speaker 2>under Ben Ali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his regime.</v>

120
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:25.593
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things were of course </v>

121
00:06:26.291 --> 00:06:28.180
<v Speaker 2>hidden from the people in the local </v>
<v Speaker 2>press,</v>

122
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:31.930
<v Speaker 2>but due to the large amount of tourists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot of foreign media was being brought</v>

123
00:06:31.931 --> 00:06:34.360
<v Speaker 2>into the country and this educated the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

124
00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:35.253
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things would never be </v>

125
00:06:35.921 --> 00:06:38.740
<v Speaker 2>published in the local press,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the foreign media,</v>

126
00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:42.730
<v Speaker 2>they were reporting everything and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>in a country with so much tourism,</v>

127
00:06:42.731 --> 00:06:43.564
<v Speaker 2>what is written outside can very easily </v>
<v Speaker 2>be read inside so people knew what was </v>

128
00:06:47.621 --> 00:06:48.454
<v Speaker 2>going on and they really didn't like it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This land do demonstrations being </v>

129
00:06:51.911 --> 00:06:52.744
<v Speaker 2>organized in several cities,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps these protests wouldn't have </v>

130
00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:57.850
<v Speaker 2>been so big if it wasn't for Mohammed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bouazizi.</v>

131
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:02.260
<v Speaker 2>He was a 26 year old man who burned </v>
<v Speaker 2>himself to death in protest after police</v>

132
00:07:02.261 --> 00:07:03.094
<v Speaker 2>took over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>History</v>

133
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.553
<v Speaker 1>me</v>

134
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:12.730
<v Speaker 2>is how the jasmine revolution started.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>

135
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.390
<v Speaker 2>thousands of protestors gathered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>every tune is Ian city.</v>

136
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike other dictators,</v>

137
00:07:18.101 --> 00:07:18.934
<v Speaker 2>Ben Ali didn't confront them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he simply lacks Ben Ali after 23 </v>

138
00:07:27.161 --> 00:07:31.300
<v Speaker 2>years in power and leaves Donisha after </v>
<v Speaker 2>this momentous occasion,</v>

139
00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.163
<v Speaker 2>the presidents of the parliaments off </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tunusia forms a provisional governments </v>

140
00:07:35.321 --> 00:07:38.860
<v Speaker 2>and fried over 500 political prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

141
00:07:38.861 --> 00:07:39.694
<v Speaker 2>but some teen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is he a dissidence who were living in </v>

142
00:07:40.901 --> 00:07:43.150
<v Speaker 2>exile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>came back to the country among them.</v>

143
00:07:43.151 --> 00:07:43.984
<v Speaker 2>But once this map Monsef Marzocchi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the president of the Arab </v>

144
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:49.353
<v Speaker 2>Commission on Human Rights.</v>

145
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.070
<v Speaker 3>You might wonder now is whether the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Tunisia,</v>

146
00:07:53.071 --> 00:07:56.910
<v Speaker 3>we are talking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's Islamic and the answer is no.</v>

147
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.103
<v Speaker 3>The donisha where</v>

148
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.020
<v Speaker 2>talking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he's the more private.</v>

149
00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.930
<v Speaker 2>So a year off the bow is easy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>burnt himself to death.</v>

150
00:08:02.990 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Junior Xeo was holding their first free </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections and our friends Marzouki would</v>

151
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:10.580
<v Speaker 2>become the first president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly was the problem?</v>

152
00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:11.623
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president was from the Islamist </v>

153
00:08:12.831 --> 00:08:17.831
<v Speaker 2>party talking about the [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>movement,</v>

154
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:20.813
<v Speaker 2>the Tunisia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then it's perhaps more moderate </v>

155
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:22.864
<v Speaker 2>version of the Islamic brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anytime when over 100 political parties </v>

156
00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:29.860
<v Speaker 2>appeared in Nardo was the only one with </v>
<v Speaker 2>an efficient structure.</v>

157
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:30.843
<v Speaker 2>This is why the party one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the majority of the seats in the tunas </v>

158
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.083
<v Speaker 2>in parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is particularly problematic if we </v>

159
00:08:35.981 --> 00:08:36.814
<v Speaker 2>take into account that this was the </v>
<v Speaker 2>party that was going to be responsible </v>

160
00:08:39.311 --> 00:08:41.950
<v Speaker 2>for crafting the new [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 2>constantly.</v>

161
00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:43.733
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

162
00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:46.763
<v Speaker 2>So you might be wondering after this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I wasn't that the tune is Ian </v>

163
00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Constitution remains so secular.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

164
00:08:52.310 --> 00:08:53.143
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

165
00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.500
<v Speaker 2>Entrepeneur critical uncertainty is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>hardcore isn't a,</v>

166
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.260
<v Speaker 2>it's created these so called Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaks.</v>

167
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:07.123
<v Speaker 2>Visa of course supported the ruling </v>
<v Speaker 2>party in order to speed up the </v>

168
00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:13.060
<v Speaker 2>Islamification of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This led to violence on the streets and</v>

169
00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:14.480
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

170
00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:21.870
<v Speaker 3>Tanisha shocked by assassinations,</v>
<v Speaker 3>opposition leaders,</v>

171
00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:23.930
<v Speaker 3>Mohamed [inaudible] and Chuck Green.</v>

172
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:24.863
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the income from tourism was falling </v>

173
00:09:26.670 --> 00:09:27.503
<v Speaker 2>sharply.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No one wants to travel to a dangerous </v>

174
00:09:29.281 --> 00:09:34.080
<v Speaker 2>country and this generated more and more</v>
<v Speaker 2>social unrest with this situation.</v>

175
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:34.914
<v Speaker 2>The secular parties created a common </v>
<v Speaker 2>front against Ennahda and this is how </v>

176
00:09:38.161 --> 00:09:38.994
<v Speaker 2>the Islam is to block,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was forced to have secular politicians </v>

177
00:09:41.071 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 2>in their cabinet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Months later,</v>

178
00:09:42.871 --> 00:09:43.704
<v Speaker 2>both the Islamists Leagues and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Muslim Brotherhood were considered </v>

179
00:09:46.021 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 2>terrorist organizations by the Tunisian </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

180
00:09:49.210 --> 00:09:50.043
<v Speaker 2>And of course the most extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians had to leave the government </v>

181
00:09:52.201 --> 00:09:53.034
<v Speaker 2>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually in some months the whole </v>

182
00:09:54.541 --> 00:09:56.790
<v Speaker 2>Ennahda movements and left the cabinet </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the left,</v>

183
00:09:56.791 --> 00:09:59.000
<v Speaker 2>the decision making power in the hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the secular</v>

184
00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:04.523
<v Speaker 2>did this with just one condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And that is that Islam must remain the </v>

185
00:10:07.921 --> 00:10:10.380
<v Speaker 2>official religion in the new </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

186
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 2>So what was the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

187
00:10:12.421 --> 00:10:13.254
<v Speaker 2>the Newtonian constitution is not based </v>
<v Speaker 2>on sharia law and it includes both </v>

188
00:10:16.561 --> 00:10:18.750
<v Speaker 2>freedom of religion and freedom of </v>
<v Speaker 2>speech,</v>

189
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:19.613
<v Speaker 2>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it also guarantees a nonreligious </v>

190
00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:26.070
<v Speaker 2>education.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Islam now holds only a symbolic position</v>

191
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.933
<v Speaker 2>in Tunisia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that when it comes to </v>

192
00:10:28.471 --> 00:10:31.440
<v Speaker 2>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tunisia is a secular nation,</v>

193
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.010
<v Speaker 2>new free media organizations within </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed and to watch followed.</v>

194
00:10:35.011 --> 00:10:35.844
<v Speaker 2>This was the creation of one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongest civil societies and the whole </v>

195
00:10:39.481 --> 00:10:40.314
<v Speaker 2>of North Africa after this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is no surprise that during the </v>

196
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:47.481
<v Speaker 2>elections in 2014 Islamist parties lost </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the secular liberal coalition.</v>

197
00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:50.850
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

198
00:10:51.450 --> 00:10:54.840
<v Speaker 2>still they believe me about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>influence of tourism in Tunisia.</v>

199
00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:55.733
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll have a look at this electoral map </v>

200
00:10:57.210 --> 00:10:58.043
<v Speaker 2>on this map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You can see how the Islamists lost in </v>

201
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:01.620
<v Speaker 2>the regions that are closer to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coast,</v>

202
00:11:01.770 --> 00:11:04.680
<v Speaker 2>and this is because that's where all the</v>
<v Speaker 2>hotels and resorts are.</v>

203
00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.550
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second because things are </v>
<v Speaker 2>about to get a little agreement.</v>

204
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:11.490
<v Speaker 1>Ooh,</v>

205
00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:13.770
<v Speaker 3>strengthening Tunisian democracy</v>

206
00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.930
<v Speaker 2>months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After two years,</v>

207
00:11:14.931 --> 00:11:15.764
<v Speaker 2>he had published that constitution dash </v>
<v Speaker 2>or the Islamic state organized that </v>

208
00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:21.850
<v Speaker 2>first terrorist attack against the El </v>
<v Speaker 2>Barrio museum.</v>

209
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.420
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the main tourist </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractions in there</v>

210
00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.473
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

211
00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:30.180
<v Speaker 3>As I resolved,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the number of British rivals,</v>

212
00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:35.330
<v Speaker 3>which looked set to break records in the</v>
<v Speaker 3>early months of 2015 has fallen by 93.2%</v>

213
00:11:38.010 --> 00:11:40.260
<v Speaker 3>for the first five months of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>years.</v>

214
00:11:40.520 --> 00:11:44.360
<v Speaker 2>After this two attacks followed and in </v>
<v Speaker 2>total 73 people were left to debt.</v>

215
00:11:44.450 --> 00:11:45.283
<v Speaker 2>This is why teaching is Ian Government </v>
<v Speaker 2>has a security crisis as well as an </v>

216
00:11:48.231 --> 00:11:51.410
<v Speaker 2>economic crisis and to one of them is </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroying their main industry,</v>

217
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 2>which is why stories like this not quite</v>
<v Speaker 2>so important.</v>

218
00:11:58.370 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>Donisha</v>

219
00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:03.160
<v Speaker 2>do you offer $50 billion of projects to </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign investors?</v>

220
00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:04.113
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the European Union has also </v>

221
00:12:05.471 --> 00:12:08.800
<v Speaker 2>eliminated or fairs on the import of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tennessee and olive oil.</v>

222
00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.330
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the European Union,</v>

223
00:12:10.331 --> 00:12:12.760
<v Speaker 2>agriculture is protected from foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>markets,</v>

224
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:16.570
<v Speaker 2>but in the case of Tunisia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is essential in order to support that</v>

225
00:12:16.571 --> 00:12:18.220
<v Speaker 2>all of industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I said before,</v>

226
00:12:18.221 --> 00:12:21.610
<v Speaker 2>he says the second largest industry in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country behind tourism,</v>

227
00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.400
<v Speaker 2>but it's a hold on it for a moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>because as you can probably imagine,</v>

228
00:12:24.401 --> 00:12:27.070
<v Speaker 2>this didn't make the European farmers </v>
<v Speaker 2>too happy.</v>

229
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Especially those ones based in </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

230
00:12:29.150 --> 00:12:29.983
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

231
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:35.040
<v Speaker 2>save our quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say no due to donation.</v>

232
00:12:35.100 --> 00:12:36.960
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well this is the specialty.</v>

233
00:12:36.961 --> 00:12:37.701
<v Speaker 2>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're given them.</v>

234
00:12:37.701 --> 00:12:38.534
<v Speaker 2>Most of that oil that is labeled as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>made in Italy is actually produced in </v>
