WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:01.690
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.673
<v Speaker 2>we have to be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The world has never been better than it </v>

3
00:00:10.001 --> 00:00:13.060
<v Speaker 2>is right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks mostly to globalization.</v>

4
00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:13.894
<v Speaker 2>There are less and less wars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Global poverty is falling markedly and </v>

5
00:00:17.011 --> 00:00:18.910
<v Speaker 2>it's quality of life is generally </v>
<v Speaker 2>improved,</v>

6
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.240
<v Speaker 2>is obviously not happening in a uniform </v>
<v Speaker 2>way across all countries.</v>

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.400
<v Speaker 2>Burdened globally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is improving.</v>

8
00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:28.263
<v Speaker 2>Many western countries have decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>rebel and refuse openness as well as </v>

9
00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:34.540
<v Speaker 2>understanding among the nations in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>

10
00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:35.374
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far right parties are spreading </v>

11
00:00:36.791 --> 00:00:38.920
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is Le Pen in France.</v>

12
00:00:38.921 --> 00:00:41.650
<v Speaker 2>There's violence is in the Netherlands </v>
<v Speaker 2>as hoffer in Austria.</v>

13
00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.750
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

14
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.823
<v Speaker 2>These are all good examples of a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>wave of politics that is also affecting </v>

15
00:00:48.561 --> 00:00:50.330
<v Speaker 2>countries like Finland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denmark,</v>

16
00:00:50.331 --> 00:00:51.530
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and Hungary,</v>

17
00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 2>among others.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>

18
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 2>it is also partly responsible for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>brexit victory in the United States.</v>

19
00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.973
<v Speaker 2>It is a movement that is taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>advantage of fear despite the fact that </v>

20
00:01:07.041 --> 00:01:10.130
<v Speaker 2>we are living in societies that are </v>
<v Speaker 2>becoming safer and safer.</v>

21
00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.163
<v Speaker 2>As you well know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these ideas are not something that is </v>

22
00:01:12.621 --> 00:01:13.454
<v Speaker 2>exclusive to Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump won the US election and he </v>

23
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:16.694
<v Speaker 2>has spoken about his views which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>clearly contrary to globalization and </v>

24
00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.440
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>

25
00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:22.274
<v Speaker 2>the best question we can ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>are there any developed countries left </v>

26
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 2>that still believe in open borders and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the globalization?</v>

27
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.000
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer to that question is yes,</v>

28
00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:32.834
<v Speaker 2>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then the video today we're going to </v>

29
00:01:34.251 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>be looking at one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>significance of those countries.</v>

30
00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Cannabis openness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 2>Two Thousand and 16 alone.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada admitted to its country more than</v>

32
00:01:46.921 --> 00:01:49.340
<v Speaker 2>300,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants.</v>

33
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 2>It's close to one percent of Canada's </v>
<v Speaker 2>total population.</v>

34
00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.993
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a greater proportion than any </v>

35
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.620
<v Speaker 2>other developed country and do note here</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this is nothing new.</v>

36
00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.940
<v Speaker 2>This is something that's been going on </v>
<v Speaker 2>for two decades,</v>

37
00:02:00.941 --> 00:02:02.910
<v Speaker 2>is a result of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that today,</v>

38
00:02:02.911 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 2>one in every five Canadians was born </v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>

39
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.110
<v Speaker 2>This is a percentage that is almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>double that of the US and the UK.</v>

40
00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:15.053
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.010
<v Speaker 2>Took.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The matter is,</v>

42
00:02:16.011 --> 00:02:19.520
<v Speaker 2>is that this hasn't led to any sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>national tragedy.</v>

43
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>quite the opposite,</v>

44
00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.883
<v Speaker 2>and Canadians well notice according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prestigious and Veronica's </v>

45
00:02:24.941 --> 00:02:25.774
<v Speaker 2>institute's most citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 80 percent of them consider </v>

46
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:29.414
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To be good for the economy and think </v>

47
00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:31.924
<v Speaker 2>that it is one of the best ways to deal </v>
<v Speaker 2>with some of the issues facing Canada </v>

48
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:35.900
<v Speaker 2>such as its aging.</v>

49
00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.450
<v Speaker 1>If</v>

50
00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.150
<v Speaker 2>you really think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does make sense.</v>

51
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:49.670
<v Speaker 2>Employment is the country's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>productive assets,</v>

52
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.660
<v Speaker 2>so why would they want to prevent it </v>
<v Speaker 2>from growing in the context of a dynamic</v>

53
00:02:53.661 --> 00:02:54.494
<v Speaker 2>economy?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's the harm of immigrants who are </v>

54
00:02:55.611 --> 00:02:56.444
<v Speaker 2>willing to work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're willing to set up companies and </v>

55
00:02:58.041 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 2>once you get an education,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is something that we have.</v>

56
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:02.680
<v Speaker 2>Visual politic thing is actually pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

57
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.840
<v Speaker 2>First Year in 2015 just introduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>became Canada's prime minister.</v>

58
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:16.410
<v Speaker 2>He defeated against all odds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The conservative at Stephen Harper.</v>

59
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 2>Harper had held the office for almost 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

60
00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:19.703
<v Speaker 2>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political agenda has been dominated </v>

61
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.920
<v Speaker 2>by a determination to deepen the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country's pro globalization policies.</v>

62
00:03:25.921 --> 00:03:27.630
<v Speaker 2>Trudeau himself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a left winger,</v>

63
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:31.200
<v Speaker 2>has been quite an advocate of promoting </v>
<v Speaker 2>free trade and social mobility.</v>

64
00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:32.093
<v Speaker 2>In his first year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he signed a free trade agreement with </v>

65
00:03:33.781 --> 00:03:37.380
<v Speaker 2>the European Union and confirmed </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada's adherence to the TPP.</v>

66
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.680
<v Speaker 2>Although trump's first action in office </v>
<v Speaker 2>was to destroy the TPP,</v>

67
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:41.563
<v Speaker 2>was going to be the biggest commercial </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements in history in just the year </v>

68
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:48.510
<v Speaker 2>Canada has built up free trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements with nearly 60 percent of the</v>

69
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:51.450
<v Speaker 2>global economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Further Trudeau wants to expand this and</v>

70
00:03:51.451 --> 00:03:55.500
<v Speaker 2>increased trade with China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've agreed to launch exploratory talks</v>

71
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 2>towards a potential free trade agreement</v>
<v Speaker 2>between Canada and China.</v>

72
00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.420
<v Speaker 2>As the government is doing more of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>same concerning immigration,</v>

73
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.283
<v Speaker 2>they've even set the goal of increasing </v>
<v Speaker 2>the number of immigrants they get 50 </v>

74
00:04:07.081 --> 00:04:07.914
<v Speaker 2>percent every single year for my refugee</v>
<v Speaker 2>fleeing Somalia to becoming a member of </v>

75
00:04:11.941 --> 00:04:12.774
<v Speaker 2>parliament in Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've met as once again a med history </v>

76
00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.233
<v Speaker 2>this week after it was named Canada's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Minister of Immigration by Prime </v>

77
00:04:18.931 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 2>Minister Justin Trudeau in a major </v>
<v Speaker 2>cabinet reshuffle.</v>

78
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.913
<v Speaker 2>Given these principles,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it probably shouldn't surprise you to </v>

79
00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:25.194
<v Speaker 2>learn that Canada is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries that are most committed to </v>

80
00:04:26.881 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 2>receiving Syrian refugees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada has received more than 33,000</v>

81
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Speaker 2>Syrian refugees since Trudeau took </v>
<v Speaker 2>office in his first year.</v>

82
00:04:34.981 --> 00:04:38.790
<v Speaker 2>Trudeau himself went to Toronto's </v>
<v Speaker 2>airport to welcome the refugees into the</v>

83
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:39.624
<v Speaker 2>country</v>

84
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.973
<v Speaker 2>migration policy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's hold on a second because </v>

85
00:04:49.771 --> 00:04:52.290
<v Speaker 2>immigration to Canada isn't totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>free,</v>

86
00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:54.480
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not as free as we're visual politic</v>

87
00:04:54.481 --> 00:04:55.314
<v Speaker 2>would like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what's really important here is not </v>

88
00:04:56.761 --> 00:05:00.090
<v Speaker 2>whether or whether there are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>excessive administrative difficulties,</v>

89
00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:00.933
<v Speaker 2>so rather than citizens shouldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>automatically view those who are </v>

90
00:05:03.451 --> 00:05:05.700
<v Speaker 2>immigrating into the country as </v>
<v Speaker 2>criminals,</v>

91
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 2>and this is precisely why Canada is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>successful,</v>

92
00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.720
<v Speaker 2>they are a country that takes pride in </v>
<v Speaker 2>looking for additional citizens.</v>

93
00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.260
<v Speaker 2>They are not looking for temporary </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants since 1967.</v>

94
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:19.530
<v Speaker 2>Immigration to Canada has been based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>a points system.</v>

95
00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.400
<v Speaker 2>This system considers qualifications,</v>
<v Speaker 2>experience professional skills,</v>

96
00:05:23.401 --> 00:05:26.310
<v Speaker 2>and the knowledge of either French or </v>
<v Speaker 2>English in the same way.</v>

97
00:05:26.311 --> 00:05:30.360
<v Speaker 2>The system also gives priority to those </v>
<v Speaker 2>who are needed by Canada's companies.</v>

98
00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.223
<v Speaker 2>Canada will lift the Mexican visa </v>
<v Speaker 2>requirement that has restricted travel </v>

99
00:05:35.281 --> 00:05:36.114
<v Speaker 2>to Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This move will make it easier for our </v>

100
00:05:37.861 --> 00:05:38.694
<v Speaker 2>Mexican friends to visit Canada wild </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing our local economies and </v>

101
00:05:42.571 --> 00:05:43.404
<v Speaker 2>strengthening our communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The tendency seems to be to make these </v>

102
00:05:46.381 --> 00:05:47.214
<v Speaker 2>procedures easier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but what is really important is the </v>

103
00:05:49.621 --> 00:05:53.670
<v Speaker 2>social recognition and the integration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of immigrants into the country.</v>

104
00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.563
<v Speaker 2>The Canadian bill of rights itself </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognizes the concept of multicultural </v>

105
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.633
<v Speaker 2>patrimony.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are solid policies to encourage </v>

106
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>

107
00:06:01.701 --> 00:06:05.630
<v Speaker 2>don't focus on stripping the immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their original cultural identity,</v>

108
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 2>but rather see that as an enriching</v>

109
00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.293
<v Speaker 2>snowball in Canadian schools.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is easy to find classes that are </v>

110
00:06:17.361 --> 00:06:21.710
<v Speaker 2>taught in Spanish or Ukrainian and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>results support these policies.</v>

111
00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 2>In deed in the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada's growth has been bigger than the</v>

112
00:06:25.281 --> 00:06:26.480
<v Speaker 2>US,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the UK,</v>

113
00:06:26.481 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 2>and Germany and its citizens in dry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a very high standard of living.</v>

114
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.063
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hopefully it might be more clear as to </v>

115
00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:34.700
<v Speaker 2>why Canada's immigration website </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapsed after trump's.</v>

116
00:06:34.701 --> 00:06:34.840
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

117
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:35.673
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>

118
00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.873
<v Speaker 2>I understand why the economists has also</v>
<v Speaker 2>had cover pages highlighting Canada's </v>

119
00:06:41.911 --> 00:06:42.744
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

120
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:46.310
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

121
00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:49.420
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Canadian model is not perfect boss.</v>

122
00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:53.100
<v Speaker 2>Compared to the new nationalist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>populist tendencies of other countries,</v>

123
00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:57.600
<v Speaker 2>Canada has shown what a desirable </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative openness can really be.</v>

124
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.523
<v Speaker 2>The key takeaway that we hope this video</v>
<v Speaker 2>really puts across is to try and make </v>

125
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:02.214
<v Speaker 2>things better in your country rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>than isolated from the rest of the </v>

126
00:07:04.711 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The latter of which is an argument.</v>

127
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 2>There's many politicians like trump are </v>
<v Speaker 2>defending,</v>

128
00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:09.653
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this isn't our opinion here at visual </v>

129
00:07:10.351 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 2>politic and now we would love to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>yours.</v>

130
00:07:13.051 --> 00:07:16.170
<v Speaker 2>Do you think immigration causes as many </v>
<v Speaker 2>problems as people claim?</v>

131
00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:19.830
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to live in a culturally </v>
<v Speaker 2>diverse country like Canada?</v>
