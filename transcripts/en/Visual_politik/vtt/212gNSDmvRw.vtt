00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:09.940
<v Speaker 2>Lego is the biggest toy manufacturer on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the planets,</v>

3
00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 2>but nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they aren't even on the stock markets.</v>

4
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.463
<v Speaker 2>Are there industry bm offs like Hasbro </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Mattel are listed on the Nasdaq </v>

5
00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.090
<v Speaker 2>exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but lego with bigger sales have presence</v>

6
00:00:19.091 --> 00:00:19.924
<v Speaker 2>in most of the world's hands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of the most valued brands keeps its </v>

7
00:00:22.411 --> 00:00:24.070
<v Speaker 2>status as a family business</v>

8
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.113
<v Speaker 2>and as we will see later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is one of the secrets to their </v>

9
00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 2>success,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only vast,</v>

10
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.293
<v Speaker 2>unlike a competitor's legging is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best 20 manufacturer when it comes to </v>

11
00:00:39.231 --> 00:00:41.690
<v Speaker 2>surviving crises.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you're wondering,</v>

12
00:00:41.691 --> 00:00:42.524
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what Christ is exactly am I talking </v>

13
00:00:43.401 --> 00:00:44.270
<v Speaker 2>about?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

14
00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.193
<v Speaker 2>of course that would be the toy crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you remember when you were a kid and </v>

15
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.910
<v Speaker 2>maybe you wrote a list of things of what</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wanted for Christmas,</v>

16
00:00:49.911 --> 00:00:51.830
<v Speaker 2>maybe you send it to Santa Claus or </v>
<v Speaker 2>someone else,</v>

17
00:00:51.831 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 2>depending on where you're from.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

18
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.103
<v Speaker 2>what did you ask for for Christmas?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure many of you wanted things like </v>

19
00:00:56.841 --> 00:00:59.270
<v Speaker 2>the playmobile pirate ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a house for your Barbie doll,</v>

20
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:00.104
<v Speaker 2>or perhaps those power rangers action </v>
<v Speaker 2>figures that changed their heads when </v>

21
00:01:02.661 --> 00:01:05.710
<v Speaker 2>you pressed the button.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But today kids have changed their tastes</v>

22
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:06.553
<v Speaker 2>dramatically.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the things they want for </v>

23
00:01:13.481 --> 00:01:14.314
<v Speaker 2>Christmas these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Video Games and I don't think anybody </v>

24
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:16.924
<v Speaker 2>will be surprised if I say that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>video game industry is absolutely on </v>

25
00:01:19.721 --> 00:01:23.200
<v Speaker 2>fire these days.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Titles like call of duty and battlefield</v>

26
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.320
<v Speaker 2>have a bigger budget than most Hollywood</v>
<v Speaker 2>productions.</v>

27
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.520
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the toy industry,</v>

28
00:01:27.521 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 2>well that's going the other way and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>explains news like this.</v>

29
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.170
<v Speaker 2>R US filed for bankruptcy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we'll keep stores open.</v>

30
00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.890
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Steve,</v>

31
00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.370
<v Speaker 2>you at the toy industry is set only in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dire straits.</v>

32
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.343
<v Speaker 2>Let's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is an exception to this rule and </v>

33
00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.200
<v Speaker 2>as you might imagine that exception is </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lego.</v>

34
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.093
<v Speaker 2>Two years ago they beat their own sales </v>
<v Speaker 2>records and they've been kicking us for </v>

35
00:01:50.651 --> 00:01:53.140
<v Speaker 2>the whole last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christmas after Christmas.</v>

36
00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.250
<v Speaker 2>The question is how is Lego surviving </v>
<v Speaker 2>the video game industry?</v>

37
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.600
<v Speaker 2>Is Lego as good as it seems or are we </v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe missing some details here?</v>

38
00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:05.493
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we are going to answer all of </v>

39
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:08.500
<v Speaker 2>these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do as usual,</v>

40
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.210
<v Speaker 2>that's taken a look back at the history</v>

41
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.450
<v Speaker 1>family</v>

42
00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.510
<v Speaker 2>business that go.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started out in a very small carpentry</v>

43
00:02:19.511 --> 00:02:22.200
<v Speaker 2>workshop in a village called billings in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the middle of dinner.</v>

44
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:23.143
<v Speaker 1>Mark,</v>

45
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:27.900
<v Speaker 2>by that time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were already some big 20 companies</v>

46
00:02:27.901 --> 00:02:28.734
<v Speaker 2>like Parker and the creators of </v>
<v Speaker 2>blockbusters and like monopoly or the </v>

47
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:31.944
<v Speaker 2>Ouija board.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During this time Mr Christine's and was </v>

48
00:02:33.481 --> 00:02:35.790
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing all kinds of wood and </v>
<v Speaker 2>products.</v>

49
00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:36.653
<v Speaker 2>But in 1932 he realized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>specialization is the key to success </v>

50
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:40.733
<v Speaker 2>with the health of his eight employees.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He started manufacturing toys and only </v>

51
00:02:43.831 --> 00:02:44.664
<v Speaker 2>toys.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Soon his product stood out for their </v>

52
00:02:46.051 --> 00:02:47.130
<v Speaker 2>quality.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

53
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.650
<v Speaker 2>we could summarize it cause work </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy with one</v>

54
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.750
<v Speaker 1>quite need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The</v>

55
00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.810
<v Speaker 2>best is good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Or Kirk Kristiansen,</v>

56
00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.943
<v Speaker 2>founder of Lego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the turning point for Lego came </v>

57
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 2>world war team.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One day a British salesman appeared in </v>

58
00:03:01.751 --> 00:03:02.584
<v Speaker 2>this carpenter's workshop with a game </v>
<v Speaker 2>changing product and this was of course </v>

59
00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:06.274
<v Speaker 2>plastic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This brand new material and our </v>

60
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.510
<v Speaker 2>factories to create things in a cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 2>precise and industrial way time.</v>

61
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.490
<v Speaker 2>The new workshop manager was Mr </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christine's son,</v>

62
00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.390
<v Speaker 2>son,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a man named gottfried.</v>

63
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.283
<v Speaker 2>He immediately realized the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 2>potential of this new material and some </v>

64
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.453
<v Speaker 2>years later and Lego licensed and now </v>
<v Speaker 2>famous block assembly system thus ends </v>

65
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:27.114
<v Speaker 2>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The most successful toy of all time was </v>

66
00:03:29.011 --> 00:03:29.844
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

67
00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.713
<v Speaker 2>controls that Lego are so intense that </v>
<v Speaker 2>even the blocks that are sold today in </v>

68
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:38.434
<v Speaker 2>2017 can be assembled with the ones that</v>
<v Speaker 2>were sold by manufacturers back in 1958 </v>

69
00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:45.190
<v Speaker 2>and the same applies to their corporate </v>
<v Speaker 2>philosophy.</v>

70
00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:47.560
<v Speaker 2>If there is a characteristic of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christians and the family,</v>

71
00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.280
<v Speaker 2>it's the they when that shooting,</v>

72
00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:56.770
<v Speaker 2>here's an example before they started to</v>
<v Speaker 2>produce thesis in Green,</v>

73
00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.450
<v Speaker 2>these fans more than 10 years conducting</v>
<v Speaker 2>studies and discussions of the companies</v>

74
00:04:01.451 --> 00:04:02.284
<v Speaker 2>in the industry had no problem taking </v>
<v Speaker 2>out loans to buy new factories and come </v>

75
00:04:04.841 --> 00:04:07.900
<v Speaker 2>up with new product lines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Lego was one of a kind.</v>

76
00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.853
<v Speaker 2>They always tried to finance their </v>
<v Speaker 2>expansion with their own profits and </v>

77
00:04:11.831 --> 00:04:15.130
<v Speaker 2>this explains why they had slower but </v>
<v Speaker 2>more solid growth.</v>

78
00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:16.023
<v Speaker 2>Despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during the 70s and eighties Lego was on </v>

79
00:04:18.161 --> 00:04:21.670
<v Speaker 2>fire and their product is covered every </v>
<v Speaker 2>stage of a child's development.</v>

80
00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:22.660
<v Speaker 2>This morning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a kid as well.</v>

81
00:04:22.661 --> 00:04:25.930
<v Speaker 2>They had deep play blocks with vivid </v>
<v Speaker 2>colors and bigger blocks.</v>

82
00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 2>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between five and 15 years old,</v>

83
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 2>you had the classic Lego pieces.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I finally,</v>

84
00:04:30.371 --> 00:04:31.204
<v Speaker 2>for the teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he wanted to improve their engineering </v>

85
00:04:32.621 --> 00:04:34.390
<v Speaker 2>skills.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was Lego technic,</v>

86
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:35.283
<v Speaker 2>and let's be honest here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has anyone not played with any of those </v>

87
00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:37.834
<v Speaker 2>products</v>

88
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.403
<v Speaker 3>as if this was</v>

89
00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:43.010
<v Speaker 2>not enough and they go had its own theme</v>
<v Speaker 2>park,</v>

90
00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.873
<v Speaker 2>the famous Lego lands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these weren't another moneymaking </v>

91
00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a minute because in the nineties</v>

92
00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:56.410
<v Speaker 2>things they went a little sour graphic </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

93
00:04:58.060 --> 00:04:58.893
<v Speaker 2>The 1960s on known as the baby boom </v>
<v Speaker 2>couples in Europe and America had lots </v>

94
00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:03.424
<v Speaker 2>and lots of babies and this meant the </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the seventies and eighties there </v>

95
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.710
<v Speaker 2>were enough kids to sustain the 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing industry.</v>

96
00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.633
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 90s they were a totally different </v>

97
00:05:10.961 --> 00:05:11.794
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden families have less kid </v>

98
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.863
<v Speaker 2>and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a bad thing for a company like </v>

99
00:05:18.641 --> 00:05:19.474
<v Speaker 2>Lego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every year they sold less than the </v>

100
00:05:20.891 --> 00:05:24.700
<v Speaker 2>previous one and no matter how many fun </v>
<v Speaker 2>parks they opened in the United States,</v>

101
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.510
<v Speaker 2>profits kept getting lower and lower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These were bad times for Lego.</v>

102
00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:29.493
<v Speaker 2>I'm a Christian</v>

103
00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.353
<v Speaker 3>family,</v>

104
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:34.033
<v Speaker 2>which makes toy plastic building blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>expects to report a loss in 1998 it's </v>

105
00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 2>the first since the 1930s during these </v>
<v Speaker 2>years,</v>

106
00:05:42.561 --> 00:05:45.170
<v Speaker 2>the CEO is the founder's Godson,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cagelles Christianson.</v>

107
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:49.010
<v Speaker 2>He was 57 years old and he had been </v>
<v Speaker 2>leading the company for nine years.</v>

108
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:53.180
<v Speaker 2>He saw how day off today his family </v>
<v Speaker 2>business was getting towards bankruptcy.</v>

109
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:54.383
<v Speaker 2>In that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he took one of the bravest and wisest </v>

110
00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:59.990
<v Speaker 2>decisions and can take.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He stepped aside and let someone younger</v>

111
00:05:59.991 --> 00:06:04.991
<v Speaker 2>take charge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Y'All didn't,</v>

112
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:07.970
<v Speaker 2>couldn't stop with just 36 when he took </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lego's wheel.</v>

113
00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.863
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was the first CEO that came from </v>

114
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:12.950
<v Speaker 2>outside of the Christian Center family.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

115
00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:14.210
<v Speaker 2>this transition,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was a friend.</v>

116
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.720
<v Speaker 2>Anyone performer in the new CEO worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>alongside each other for years.</v>

117
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.173
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

118
00:06:22.950 --> 00:06:25.120
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] would advise and Jorgen with</v>

119
00:06:25.121 --> 00:06:28.030
<v Speaker 2>the site and this new strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was based on two pillars.</v>

120
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.660
<v Speaker 2>Specialization as marketing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the one hand,</v>

121
00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.573
<v Speaker 2>they go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>got rid of everything that didn't </v>

122
00:06:32.311 --> 00:06:35.680
<v Speaker 2>contribute to what they did best.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Manufacturing plastic blocks.</v>

123
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:40.120
<v Speaker 2>The rest was totally extensible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They went from 7,000 workers to a little</v>

124
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 2>more than 3000 and Jorgen completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>restructured the company.</v>

125
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:44.493
<v Speaker 2>Up until then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the lego video games were created by a </v>

126
00:06:46.181 --> 00:06:49.990
<v Speaker 2>subsidiary called Lego interactive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You're getting sold that fat men started</v>

127
00:06:49.991 --> 00:06:54.010
<v Speaker 2>charging royalties to anyone who wanted </v>
<v Speaker 2>to produce lego inspired video games,</v>

128
00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:56.290
<v Speaker 2>and the same is happening in other areas</v>
<v Speaker 2>of business.</v>

129
00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.760
<v Speaker 2>Troubled Lego sells theme park.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other pillar was marketing.</v>

130
00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.540
<v Speaker 2>You're going to realize that his plastic</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks were wonderful,</v>

131
00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.910
<v Speaker 2>but they didn't really meet customers' </v>
<v Speaker 2>needs.</v>

132
00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:09.803
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>teachers and experts agreed that Lego </v>

133
00:07:11.131 --> 00:07:11.964
<v Speaker 2>was a really educational toy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It all kids to be creative and </v>

134
00:07:14.581 --> 00:07:15.414
<v Speaker 2>systematic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.360
<v Speaker 2>Even rival companies recognize that Lego</v>
<v Speaker 2>blocks were of a higher quality,</v>

136
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:28.920
<v Speaker 2>but you guys about the opinion of a </v>
<v Speaker 2>pedagogue or a rival company,</v>

137
00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:31.170
<v Speaker 2>you see when you have a toy </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing company,</v>

138
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:32.033
<v Speaker 2>your consumers of the children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe you remember how it was when </v>

139
00:07:34.711 --> 00:07:35.544
<v Speaker 2>you were a child.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What did you do when you played with </v>

140
00:07:36.991 --> 00:07:37.824
<v Speaker 2>toys?</v>

141
00:07:41.260 --> 00:07:42.760
<v Speaker 2>Made up stories.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

142
00:07:42.761 --> 00:07:45.310
<v Speaker 2>when it comes to the Lego blocks making </v>
<v Speaker 2>stories,</v>

143
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.173
<v Speaker 2>it isn't the first step.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First you have to put all the pieces </v>

144
00:07:48.011 --> 00:07:50.950
<v Speaker 2>together so you can have the helicopter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have with the police,</v>

145
00:07:50.951 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 2>Scott,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can have with the police station.</v>

146
00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.340
<v Speaker 2>But once you have that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you just want to play.</v>

147
00:07:54.341 --> 00:07:57.280
<v Speaker 2>You want to make your own movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the hero against the bad guy,</v>

148
00:07:57.370 --> 00:07:58.203
<v Speaker 2>all of that good stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how lego realized that children </v>

149
00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.760
<v Speaker 2>needed characters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>scenarios and stories.</v>

150
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:09.100
<v Speaker 2>You see the old lego products,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was something like this.</v>

151
00:08:13.280 --> 00:08:14.870
<v Speaker 2>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're a steam train,</v>

152
00:08:14.871 --> 00:08:16.390
<v Speaker 2>a pirate ship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a castle,</v>

153
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.800
<v Speaker 2>a city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not exactly at the most thrilling things</v>

154
00:08:18.801 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But after 2000 lego products went to the</v>

155
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:22.950
<v Speaker 2>next level</v>

156
00:08:22.950 --> 00:08:23.783
<v Speaker 1>lever</v>

157
00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:32.040
<v Speaker 2>see an underwater city about to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>destroyed by a giant octopus.</v>

158
00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 2>So now here is the big question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think is more exciting?</v>

159
00:08:36.311 --> 00:08:39.670
<v Speaker 2>A steam train or a giant optimists?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

160
00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 2>with this principal is how a new series </v>
<v Speaker 2>was born from the Atlantis series to the</v>

161
00:08:44.561 --> 00:08:45.394
<v Speaker 2>now legendary bionicle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden lego stopped selling </v>

162
00:08:47.921 --> 00:08:50.890
<v Speaker 2>plastic building blocks and started </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling story</v>

163
00:08:55.270 --> 00:08:55.940
<v Speaker 3>stories.</v>

164
00:08:55.940 --> 00:08:56.773
<v Speaker 2>Good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's complex enough to inspire toys </v>

165
00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.670
<v Speaker 2>but also even video games and even </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

166
00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:05.450
<v Speaker 2>That new product strategy was based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>three key questions.</v>

167
00:09:05.510 --> 00:09:09.620
<v Speaker 2>What your getting called the three </v>
<v Speaker 2>moments of truth and a game one.</v>

168
00:09:09.770 --> 00:09:12.410
<v Speaker 2>What it's advertised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it make a child say,</v>

169
00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:15.620
<v Speaker 2>I want this too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once he opens the box,</v>

170
00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:17.490
<v Speaker 2>does it make them go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want more of,</v>

171
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:19.903
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

172
00:09:22.540 --> 00:09:24.910
<v Speaker 2>one month later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does he come back to the toy,</v>

173
00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:25.803
<v Speaker 2>rebuild it and still play with it or </v>
<v Speaker 2>does he put it on the shelf and forget </v>

174
00:09:28.481 --> 00:09:29.590
<v Speaker 2>about it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but also any of that,</v>

175
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:32.200
<v Speaker 2>if kids like stories,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why don't make toys about their favorite</v>

176
00:09:32.201 --> 00:09:33.034
<v Speaker 2>movies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how lego partnered with Lucas </v>

177
00:09:34.331 --> 00:09:39.331
<v Speaker 2>films to launch a collection based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Star Wars Lego of course the same.</v>

178
00:09:40.821 --> 00:09:43.460
<v Speaker 2>When's the Batman Lord of the rings and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even Harry Potter?</v>

179
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Virtually there is no movie the kids </v>
<v Speaker 2>enjoy that has no lego licensed products</v>

180
00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:52.100
<v Speaker 2>and you can believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these things are at a blockbuster.</v>

181
00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:56.193
<v Speaker 2>There are hundreds of different makers </v>
<v Speaker 2>of action figures and dolls whose </v>

182
00:10:00.281 --> 00:10:01.114
<v Speaker 2>corporate logos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Children are increasingly in different </v>

183
00:10:03.671 --> 00:10:04.504
<v Speaker 2>to Lego boasts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an estimated 85% share of the building </v>

184
00:10:08.951 --> 00:10:10.300
<v Speaker 2>block market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

185
00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.153
<v Speaker 2>do you remember when I said Lego had </v>
<v Speaker 2>sold all its subsidiary companies that </v>

186
00:10:13.841 --> 00:10:15.940
<v Speaker 2>didn't relate to manufacturing of </v>
<v Speaker 2>plastic pieces?</v>

187
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:17.110
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was true,</v>

188
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:20.830
<v Speaker 2>but now they make a fortune with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>royalties they charge to all of those.</v>

189
00:10:20.831 --> 00:10:24.070
<v Speaker 2>He made video games and movies about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lego and believe me,</v>

190
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.880
<v Speaker 2>this has become an absolute money making</v>
<v Speaker 2>machine.</v>

191
00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 2>The lego movie premiered last Friday and</v>
<v Speaker 2>made $69 million in its opening weekend,</v>

192
00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 2>making it the largest debut of the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>so</v>

193
00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:40.913
<v Speaker 3>far.</v>

194
00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:45.273
<v Speaker 2>This explains why while other toy </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies are struggling to win the </v>

195
00:10:47.501 --> 00:10:48.334
<v Speaker 2>battle against video games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lego is making record sales in all </v>

196
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:53.230
<v Speaker 2>markets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the USA.</v>

197
00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:57.783
<v Speaker 2>Big Opportunity here is Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a brand new untapped market </v>

198
00:11:02.171 --> 00:11:03.004
<v Speaker 2>ready to be opened.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Companies like mattel or Hasbro are </v>

199
00:11:05.651 --> 00:11:06.484
<v Speaker 2>already compensating for their losses </v>
<v Speaker 2>and America and Europe with sales in </v>

200
00:11:09.071 --> 00:11:09.904
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

201
00:11:13.350 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 2>like for Lego.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a whole new challenge.</v>

202
00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.200
<v Speaker 2>This is why they're making changes at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the company.</v>

203
00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.333
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we aren't talking about a big challenge </v>

204
00:11:22.081 --> 00:11:22.914
<v Speaker 2>here in the last 15 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like it was multiplied best sales by </v>

205
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:30.231
<v Speaker 2>five and they went from having 3000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>workers to more than 19,000 nonetheless,</v>

206
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:31.434
<v Speaker 2>you know from this video that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Christine's in his philosophy is not </v>

207
00:11:33.511 --> 00:11:34.344
<v Speaker 2>about taking many risks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the last two years sales have </v>

208
00:11:36.781 --> 00:11:37.614
<v Speaker 2>declined to this or this and this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now they want to conquer China as they </v>

209
00:11:39.871 --> 00:11:42.210
<v Speaker 2>want to have their accounting books </v>
<v Speaker 2>healthier than ever.</v>

210
00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.073
<v Speaker 2>And this explains policies like this one</v>
<v Speaker 2>lego predict growth in its China </v>

211
00:11:49.801 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 2>business but sheds 1400 jobs after a </v>
<v Speaker 2>sales slump.</v>

212
00:11:56.730 --> 00:11:57.360
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

213
00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.940
<v Speaker 2>so now that you know the story of Lego,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question really becomes,</v>

214
00:11:59.941 --> 00:12:00.774
<v Speaker 2>do you think lego can conquer the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese markets or do you think they're </v>

215
00:12:03.271 --> 00:12:05.670
<v Speaker 2>going to lose the battle?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're against video games?</v>

216

<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
