<v Speaker 1>you all know,</v>

3
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.410
<v Speaker 1>this political leader was president of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>

4
00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.340
<v Speaker 1>barely two mandates ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>between 2010 and 2014</v>

5
00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.913
<v Speaker 2>Tina</v>

6
00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:28.933
<v Speaker 1>now after achieving a strong and healthy</v>
<v Speaker 1>victory by almost 10 points in the 2017 </v>

7
00:00:33.201 --> 00:00:34.034
<v Speaker 1>presidential elections to and pin yarrow</v>
<v Speaker 1>was declared president on March the </v>

8
00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:42.490
<v Speaker 1>11th.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have you in this video today,</v>

9
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:50.284
<v Speaker 1>we are going to be seeing what kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chili this president is inheriting as </v>

10
00:00:54.071 --> 00:00:56.710
<v Speaker 1>well as the greatest challenges that lie</v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead for him,</v>

11
00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.410
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's get to know this character better.</v>

12
00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's see who Sebastian Pinera really </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

13
00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

14
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:09.413
<v Speaker 1>Is Sebastian Kenyatta?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to know that Sebastian Pinera </v>

15
00:01:14.391 --> 00:01:17.830
<v Speaker 1>for many reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't just another politician we use.</v>

16
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.330
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a man who on the one</v>
<v Speaker 1>hand zones,</v>

17
00:01:20.331 --> 00:01:24.530
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest fortunes in Chile for</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortune Forbes magazine estimates.</v>

18
00:01:24.531 --> 00:01:27.590
<v Speaker 1>There's no less than two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$7,000,000,000.</v>

19
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

20
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>You'll see them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They'll go,</v>

21
00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.130
<v Speaker 2>yet nobody's suitable.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Keep the feet on the politicals.</v>

22
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.670
<v Speaker 2>He lost the wound book.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know.</v>

23
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sebastian Pinera was an aggressive,</v>

24
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>self-made businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do not be fooled by his smile.</v>

25
00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:00.174
<v Speaker 1>His record shows that for a long time </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew how to play to the limit and it's </v>

26
00:02:04.201 --> 00:02:07.830
<v Speaker 1>become a major investor in various </v>
<v Speaker 1>sectors such as construction,</v>

27
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.450
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airlines,</v>

28
00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:12.090
<v Speaker 1>and TV channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that I think about it,</v>

29
00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:15.750
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to find a sexier in </v>
<v Speaker 1>which pin Yaarit didn't try his luck.</v>

30
00:02:15.751 --> 00:02:16.584
<v Speaker 1>Even in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decided to death on the football </v>

31
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:21.690
<v Speaker 1>industry and took control of a team,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not just any team.</v>

32
00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:22.553
<v Speaker 1>Nope.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took control of the most important </v>

33
00:02:23.821 --> 00:02:26.250
<v Speaker 1>soccer team in Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Color color.</v>

34
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.143
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many critics accuse him of buying this </v>

35
00:02:28.621 --> 00:02:29.454
<v Speaker 1>team north as an investment spot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a political maneuver like Silvio </v>

36
00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Berlusconi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't think that Pinera is exploit,</v>

37
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>swell only in the business exit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

38
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:39.174
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

39
00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.310
<v Speaker 1>the political arena,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current president of Chile also left</v>

40
00:02:45.311 --> 00:02:46.144
<v Speaker 1>his mark in 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became the first right wing </v>

41
00:02:48.341 --> 00:02:51.880
<v Speaker 1>presidents to be democratically elected </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1958.</v>

42
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:53.043
<v Speaker 1>He also became the first right wing </v>
<v Speaker 1>president since Chile underwent its </v>

43
00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:58.770
<v Speaker 1>democratic transition after a Gusto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinochet's Yep.</v>

44
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Now in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is happening again.</v>

45
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.143
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that Sebastien Vignette </v>

46
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.240
<v Speaker 1>road is a pretty fortunate guy and I </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't think he'd disagree.</v>

47
00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that in his first term,</v>

48
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.544
<v Speaker 1>despite having to face the consequences </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a terrible earthquake that shook his </v>

49
00:03:14.711 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 1>country just two weeks before he took </v>
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>

50
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:19.540
<v Speaker 1>his first governments had relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>good results,</v>

51
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.973
<v Speaker 1>at least half of our efforts throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire administration were devoted </v>

52
00:03:23.771 --> 00:03:24.604
<v Speaker 1>to rebuilding the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and consequently we had to sacrifice </v>

53
00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>many things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We wanted to do Rodrigo Hinzpeter,</v>

54
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.353
<v Speaker 1>minister of the interior and Minister of</v>
<v Speaker 1>defense in Sebastian Pianos for </v>

55
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.060
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that no great revolutionary</v>

56
00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:38.890
<v Speaker 1>change really happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

57
00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:39.724
<v Speaker 1>in his first four years of government in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy grew by more than five </v>

58
00:03:41.861 --> 00:03:44.620
<v Speaker 1>percent per year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 1 million jobs were created,</v>

59
00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>wages increased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty fell sharply.</v>

60
00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:49.413
<v Speaker 1>We had a really good government in which</v>
<v Speaker 1>every social and economic indicator </v>

61
00:03:52.481 --> 00:03:53.314
<v Speaker 1>improved in Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have more experience now and </v>

62
00:03:55.151 --> 00:03:57.380
<v Speaker 1>experience counts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sebastian Miata.</v>

63
00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.530
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is the viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

64
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>all that experience can be really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really important.</v>

65
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.760
<v Speaker 1>And why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:04:03.761 --> 00:04:06.010
<v Speaker 1>because today chili is really quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

67
00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.390
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to this.</v>

68
00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Today's Chili.</v>

69
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:25.940
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

70
00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:30.240
<v Speaker 1>He told you here on visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>

71
00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.100
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think it will surprise </v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone,</v>

72
00:04:32.101 --> 00:04:32.934
<v Speaker 1>but in the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile has been something like Latin </v>

73
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.190
<v Speaker 1>America's Christiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronaldo,</v>

74
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.280
<v Speaker 1>the country that grew the most,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one that had the most success,</v>

75
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:45.060
<v Speaker 1>convincing proof of this was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution of the Chilean middle class,</v>

76
00:04:45.061 --> 00:04:49.290
<v Speaker 1>which multiplies by almost three within </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very short span of time.</v>

77
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.873
<v Speaker 1>The Chilean Middleclass grew from 23 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point seven percent to 64 point three </v>

78
00:04:54.631 --> 00:04:57.870
<v Speaker 1>percent of the population in 25 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

79
00:04:57.871 --> 00:04:59.940
<v Speaker 1>as we saw in a previous video in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

80
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.610
<v Speaker 1>specifically during Micell Bash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allays last term,</v>

81
00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.080
<v Speaker 1>things really changed.</v>

82
00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.810
<v Speaker 4>Wished you let them sooner.</v>

83
00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.890
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

84
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:24.940
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic growth has plummeted.</v>

85
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.860
<v Speaker 1>Job Creation has slowed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wages haven't grown,</v>

86
00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:30.350
<v Speaker 1>and foreign investment has dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lately.</v>

87
00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:34.880
<v Speaker 1>The only thing that has grown in Chile </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the number of public employees,</v>

88
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:37.280
<v Speaker 1>taxes and bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

89
00:05:37.281 --> 00:05:38.114
<v Speaker 1>Practically every economic parameters </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a very negative change during the </v>

90
00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:43.010
<v Speaker 1>child.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ashley's last time.</v>

91
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:44.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out,</v>

92
00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:48.620
<v Speaker 1>there has been an average growth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>belly one point eight percent per year,</v>

93
00:05:48.621 --> 00:05:49.454
<v Speaker 1>which implies that this legislation was </v>
<v Speaker 1>the worst economic growth since the </v>

94
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.550
<v Speaker 1>democratic trends</v>

95
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.560
<v Speaker 3>session.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>

96
00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 1>in recent years she has grown,</v>

97
00:05:58.330 --> 00:05:59.163
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>less than the world economy and it's </v>

98
00:05:59.781 --> 00:06:02.520
<v Speaker 5>considerably less than it's specific </v>
<v Speaker 5>alliance counterparts,</v>

99
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:03.620
<v Speaker 5>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Peru,</v>

100
00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:04.633
<v Speaker 5>and Colombia.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And that's not all the public deficit </v>

101
00:06:06.921 --> 00:06:10.370
<v Speaker 5>when from being a guest to a permanent </v>
<v Speaker 5>tenants.</v>

102
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 5>And of course that's certainly has </v>
<v Speaker 5>consequences.</v>

103
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.480
<v Speaker 5>Public debt,</v>
<v Speaker 5>although still low,</v>

104
00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:18.420
<v Speaker 5>has reached its highest level since </v>
<v Speaker 5>1993.</v>

105
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.240
<v Speaker 1>Having the fiscal debt double every four</v>
<v Speaker 1>years isn't sustainable.</v>

106
00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.670
<v Speaker 1>That's the road to the precipice for </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap.</v>

107
00:06:29.671 --> 00:06:31.560
<v Speaker 1>Lorraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minister of finance,</v>

108
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.483
<v Speaker 1>although by far the worst development </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been the four year consecutive drop </v>

109
00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:38.670
<v Speaker 1>in investments and it wasn't only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy that went.</v>

110
00:06:38.671 --> 00:06:39.504
<v Speaker 1>South crime rates have increased a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the near region where there's a </v>

111
00:06:44.041 --> 00:06:44.874
<v Speaker 1>conflict with the indigenous people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mapuches who demands more autonomy </v>

112
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:48.714
<v Speaker 1>and recognition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Violent acts have exploded growing by a </v>

113
00:06:51.671 --> 00:06:53.370
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 50 percent.</v>

114
00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:08.483
<v Speaker 1>And even regarding the government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>decision to suspend the hospital </v>

115
00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:11.814
<v Speaker 1>concession system has meant that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has barely been able to </v>

116
00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:16.470
<v Speaker 1>invest more than half of what they'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>budgeted,</v>

117
00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:19.950
<v Speaker 1>making wait lists and quality issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a chronic problem,</v>

118
00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:23.850
<v Speaker 1>and let's not deceive ourselves here as </v>
<v Speaker 1>always,</v>

119
00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:26.730
<v Speaker 1>the ones most effected by all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>are not the richest,</v>

120
00:07:26.731 --> 00:07:29.910
<v Speaker 1>but the middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even more so for the most vulnerable</v>

121
00:07:29.911 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 1>people in the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor people.</v>

122
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:32.843
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fair to say the Chileans have new </v>

123
00:07:34.021 --> 00:07:36.570
<v Speaker 1>reason to celebrate me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Basha lays last time.</v>

124
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.463
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were an incredibly intense four </v>

125
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:39.954
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now perhaps we could analyze what's </v>

126
00:07:44.271 --> 00:07:47.150
<v Speaker 1>happening in Chile by taking a look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>their economic freedom index,</v>

127
00:07:47.151 --> 00:07:51.500
<v Speaker 1>who's correlation with a country's level</v>
<v Speaker 1>of wealth and prosperity is very high.</v>

128
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the calabash relays,</v>

129
00:07:52.731 --> 00:07:55.560
<v Speaker 1>last term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eat felt from seventh position too.</v>

130
00:07:56.170 --> 00:07:57.003
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

131
00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:02.673
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the situation that the new </v>

132
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:04.444
<v Speaker 1>president of Chile has to face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the question we need to ask </v>

133
00:08:06.761 --> 00:08:07.594
<v Speaker 1>ourselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what should this new government's </v>

134
00:08:09.311 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 1>priorities be?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we expect?</v>

135
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.000
<v Speaker 1>What should we expect from them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:08:13.030 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look.</v>

137
00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:18.660
<v Speaker 5>That's the name of it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you're not getting it a little bit,</v>

138
00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:43.270
<v Speaker 1>great challenges.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

139
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:44.113
<v Speaker 1>it seems quite clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's in a country that isn't exactly </v>

140
00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:49.700
<v Speaker 1>cheap and in which three out of four </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers make less than $800 a month,</v>

141
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:52.850
<v Speaker 1>the economy has to be then number one </v>
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>

142
00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>If the economy isn't doing well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social statistics do well either,</v>

143
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>and this seems to be very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear for the new government.</v>

144
00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:00.923
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pinera,</v>

145
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:05.040
<v Speaker 1>the new president has promised to focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>his efforts on doubling economic growth.</v>

146
00:09:05.041 --> 00:09:05.874
<v Speaker 1>Creating hundreds of jobs sends laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>the foundations for Chile to become the </v>

147
00:09:08.761 --> 00:09:12.270
<v Speaker 1>first developed country in Latin America</v>
<v Speaker 1>by 2025,</v>

148
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.590
<v Speaker 1>but of course you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

149
00:09:16.710 --> 00:09:17.543
<v Speaker 1>how on earth can they achieve this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I hope he doesn't think that a mere tax </v>

150
00:09:21.061 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 1>reform is going to be enough to restore </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili's.</v>

151
00:09:23.221 --> 00:09:27.480
<v Speaker 1>Growth is going to need an aggressive </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy to stimulate diversification.</v>

152
00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>Almost half of the country's exports are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still copper.</v>

153
00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.580
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Hausmann.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

154
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:34.150
<v Speaker 1>to achieve the 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25 goal,</v>

155
00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:37.920
<v Speaker 1>the country needs to deal with three </v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear priorities,</v>

156
00:09:37.950 --> 00:09:40.710
<v Speaker 1>diversifying their economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their productivity,</v>

157
00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:41.573
<v Speaker 1>and adjust their public accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do not think that this is an easy </v>

158
00:09:45.721 --> 00:09:49.020
<v Speaker 1>task to diversify the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to stop relying on raw materials,</v>

159
00:09:49.021 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 1>especially copper and boost their </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

160
00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.700
<v Speaker 1>Then near is Chile will need a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

161
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.500
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will need to promote investment,</v>

162
00:09:55.501 --> 00:09:56.334
<v Speaker 1>especially foreign investments that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>attract more companies and foreign </v>

163
00:09:58.861 --> 00:10:02.430
<v Speaker 1>capital who will bet on Shelly to </v>
<v Speaker 1>produce and provide services.</v>

164
00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.490
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot lamb could really be helped by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reversal of bash delays,</v>

165
00:10:05.491 --> 00:10:06.324
<v Speaker 1>terrible tax reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which not only raised taxes on </v>

166
00:10:08.251 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also punished that investments.</v>

167
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:13.140
<v Speaker 1>This was really not a good idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

168
00:10:13.141 --> 00:10:15.960
<v Speaker 1>they should decrease the huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy that exists.</v>

169
00:10:15.961 --> 00:10:19.200
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by digitizing every possible process.</v>

170
00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:20.063
<v Speaker 1>Seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is a much more controversial </v>

171
00:10:21.871 --> 00:10:22.704
<v Speaker 1>issue for this Latin American country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to promote a program to </v>

172
00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:27.570
<v Speaker 1>attract foreign talents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

173
00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.630
<v Speaker 1>they really need to be promoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>

174
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:32.440
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chile,</v>

175
00:10:32.441 --> 00:10:35.140
<v Speaker 1>the immigrant population has grown a lot</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>

176
00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:35.974
<v Speaker 1>but it's still very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't even reached three percent of </v>

177
00:10:38.051 --> 00:10:38.884
<v Speaker 1>the population and she lands like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compare themselves with Australia and </v>

178
00:10:41.891 --> 00:10:45.250
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand were immigrants make up 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the total population.</v>

179
00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.470
<v Speaker 1>10 Times more than they do in Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

180
00:10:47.471 --> 00:10:48.304
<v Speaker 1>you really did hear that right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the best way to gain talents and </v>

181
00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:50.944
<v Speaker 1>promote different businesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities is to attract people with </v>

182
00:10:53.381 --> 00:10:55.840
<v Speaker 1>different skills and abilities from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>over the world.</v>

183
00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.900
<v Speaker 1>We're actually going to be discussing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that in more detail really soon,</v>

184
00:11:00.930 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a great example.</v>

185
00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:05.490
<v Speaker 1>In Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the great global innovation center,</v>

186
00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:07.970
<v Speaker 1>Fifty four percent of entrepreneurs are </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign.</v>

187
00:11:07.971 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about an open door,</v>

188
00:11:12.061 --> 00:11:12.894
<v Speaker 1>but we are talking about setting up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mechanism that clarifies and promotes </v>

189
00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:17.940
<v Speaker 1>talent attraction because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

190
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.740
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if it all goes well,</v>

191
00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:20.633
<v Speaker 1>surely you can aspire to become the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great benchmark for business in Latin </v>

192
00:11:24.180 --> 00:11:25.013
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that implies attracting </v>

193
00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:29.410
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

194
00:11:29.411 --> 00:11:33.370
<v Speaker 1>and this is an important detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to all Chilean standards,</v>

195
00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:37.360
<v Speaker 1>immigrants have more education on </v>
<v Speaker 1>average that Labor participation is much</v>

196
00:11:37.361 --> 00:11:38.770
<v Speaker 1>higher and they even though</v>

197
00:11:39.200 --> 00:11:40.033
<v Speaker 3>money</v>

198
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.473
<v Speaker 1>policies eat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to enforce improving relations </v>

199
00:11:43.611 --> 00:11:44.444
<v Speaker 1>between universities and companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting insecurity and ending the </v>

200
00:11:47.541 --> 00:11:50.990
<v Speaker 1>public deficits as well as improving </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure and increasing savings.</v>

201
00:11:54.960 --> 00:11:55.793
<v Speaker 1>So now if we take a look at the program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will see that the president's </v>

202
00:11:58.901 --> 00:11:59.734
<v Speaker 1>promises seem to align with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in principle has been as good change </v>

203
00:12:02.891 --> 00:12:04.690
<v Speaker 1>is going to be really good for Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

204
00:12:04.691 --> 00:12:06.070
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>

205
00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:07.083
<v Speaker 1>only time will tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a moment because not </v>

206
00:12:09.491 --> 00:12:12.270
<v Speaker 1>everything is quite so simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

207
00:12:12.271 --> 00:12:13.104
<v Speaker 1>due to an electoral reform that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted pin Jerez coalition doesn't </v>

208
00:12:15.881 --> 00:12:19.870
<v Speaker 1>have a majority in Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so negotiating and seeking parliamentary</v>

209
00:12:19.871 --> 00:12:23.200
<v Speaker 1>agreements will be a priority for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>new governmental team.</v>

210
00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.093
<v Speaker 1>So Dev you are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the way things are in Chile </v>

211
00:12:26.171 --> 00:12:27.490
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

212
00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.640
<v Speaker 1>What's your opinion on Sebastian Pinera </v>
<v Speaker 1>is new governments.</v>

213
00:12:30.670 --> 00:12:33.520
<v Speaker 1>Do you think his government will be good</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Chile?</v>
