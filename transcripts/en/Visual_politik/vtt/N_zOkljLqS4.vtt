1
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.940
<v Speaker 1>Democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a tricky concept now.</v>

2
00:00:05.941 --> 00:00:08.100
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all agree that people must have a say</v>

3
00:00:08.101 --> 00:00:08.934
<v Speaker 1>on governmental decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hands were kind of </v>

4
00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:12.294
<v Speaker 1>scared to see what happens when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens are manipulated by a populist </v>

5
00:00:15.481 --> 00:00:16.314
<v Speaker 1>politician.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why direct democracy and </v>

6
00:00:18.961 --> 00:00:23.961
<v Speaker 1>referendums are quite so controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In theory it seems like a great idea,</v>

7
00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:33.210
<v Speaker 1>so I'll ask the voters directionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the very laws that affect them,</v>

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.230
<v Speaker 1>but what happens when we actually put </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this into practice?</v>

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.073
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

10
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occasionally you do get a rather nasty </v>

11
00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:45.570
<v Speaker 1>surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not always.</v>

12
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:46.493
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one country that needed direct </v>

13
00:00:48.451 --> 00:00:51.840
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cornerstone of that political system,</v>

14
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.760
<v Speaker 1>no war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite what you might think.</v>

15
00:00:53.761 --> 00:00:54.594
<v Speaker 1>We are not talking about Switzerland </v>
<v Speaker 1>here this time we're talking about </v>

16
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.030
<v Speaker 1>liquidity</v>

17
00:00:59.030 --> 00:00:59.863
<v Speaker 2>shine.</v>

18
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.620
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

19
00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.411
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>

20
00:01:08.411 --> 00:01:09.244
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should you care about such a small </v>

21
00:01:11.261 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lichtenstein,</v>

23
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.750
<v Speaker 1>it has a population of less than 38,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants,</v>

24
00:01:16.751 --> 00:01:20.470
<v Speaker 1>but despite their size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their political system is one of a kind.</v>

25
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:21.393
<v Speaker 1>Despite being a constitutional monarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the political decisions in this </v>

26
00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:29.630
<v Speaker 1>principality done through referendums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes economic policy.</v>

27
00:01:29.631 --> 00:01:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Social spending and even citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

28
00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.023
<v Speaker 1>that is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you wanted to become a lichtenstein </v>

29
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:36.384
<v Speaker 1>or your neighbors get to choose whether </v>
<v Speaker 1>to accept or reject you through a </v>

30
00:01:39.581 --> 00:01:42.760
<v Speaker 1>popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the right to self determination can</v>

31
00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:43.594
<v Speaker 1>be guaranteed by referendum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that any of the 11 </v>

32
00:01:46.691 --> 00:01:47.524
<v Speaker 1>municipalities in sight of Lichtenstein </v>
<v Speaker 1>can hold a popular vote to decide </v>

33
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:51.574
<v Speaker 1>whether they want to stay in the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>or become an independent nation or </v>

34
00:01:55.121 --> 00:01:57.190
<v Speaker 1>sounds pretty crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:58.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it certainly seems to have served </v>

36
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.050
<v Speaker 1>Lichtenstein incredibly well along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatar.</v>

37
00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.930
<v Speaker 1>Lichtenstein is the wealthiest country </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet,</v>

38
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.740
<v Speaker 1>at least when it comes to GDP per capita</v>
<v Speaker 1>at purchasing power parity.</v>

39
00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.290
<v Speaker 1>This country is also known for its </v>
<v Speaker 1>political stability.</v>

40
00:02:11.291 --> 00:02:15.340
<v Speaker 1>It's rule of law and its business </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly policies and well at this point</v>

41
00:02:15.341 --> 00:02:17.350
<v Speaker 1>in the video you might be beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>

42
00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:19.270
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is all of this possible?</v>

43
00:02:19.271 --> 00:02:20.104
<v Speaker 1>How can you manage the guarantees such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>stable political system when people can </v>

44
00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:28.090
<v Speaker 1>vote in any crazy law they want simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a referendum?</v>

45
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.983
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is what we were wondering here at </v>

46
00:02:30.161 --> 00:02:33.670
<v Speaker 1>visual politic to and to figure out the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to this question.</v>

47
00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>We decided that the best thing was to go</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the country and last,</v>

48
00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.433
<v Speaker 1>so we did just that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Gal is a village with no more than </v>

49
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:03.994
<v Speaker 1>2000 inhabitants that technically it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could become an independent sovereign </v>

50
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.074
<v Speaker 1>country if it wanted to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we wanted to find out exactly how </v>

51
00:03:14.721 --> 00:03:17.600
<v Speaker 1>that would happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we spoke with the mayor of the town.</v>

52
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.320
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you for joining us today.</v>

<v Speaker 3>with us and just answer a few a few </v>

54
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:26.280
<v Speaker 3>questions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If we could start off,</v>

55
00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:27.143
<v Speaker 3>if I could ask,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what is the legal way for the town of </v>

56
00:03:30.361 --> 00:03:35.361
<v Speaker 3>regale could separate from the country </v>
<v Speaker 3>of Lichtenstein and how could,</v>

57
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.550
<v Speaker 3>how could regale hold a self </v>

<v Speaker 1>Prince Hans,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But make no mistake here.</v>

82
00:05:22.981 --> 00:05:25.380
<v Speaker 1>His wealth doesn't come from his </v>
<v Speaker 1>political role,</v>

83
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.333
<v Speaker 1>but instead from his business career,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is the owner of the lgbt banking </v>

<v Speaker 1>One of the biggest asset management </v>

<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

87
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:41.710
<v Speaker 1>He inherited the principality in 1989 </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can say that he is the father of</v>

88
00:05:41.711 --> 00:05:44.650
<v Speaker 1>the direct democracy system here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lichtenstein.</v>

89
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:46.990
<v Speaker 1>In his book the state in the third </v>
<v Speaker 1>millennium.</v>

90
00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.370
<v Speaker 1>He outlined a way to implement this </v>
<v Speaker 1>system in a larger country and well,</v>

91
00:05:51.371 --> 00:05:53.130
<v Speaker 1>this is what we wanted to talk to him</v>

92
00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 3>about yesterday and Highness.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Thank you once again for being here.</v>

93
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:59.540
<v Speaker 3>I really appreciate taking time to talk </v>
<v Speaker 3>to us and inviting us to your home.</v>

94
00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what do you mean?</v>

95
00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.983
<v Speaker 3>It's a really broad question,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but what do you mean by the state as a </v>

96
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:06.110
<v Speaker 3>service provider?</v>

97
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:10.350
<v Speaker 5>I think the state should really </v>
<v Speaker 5>concentrate on those jobs,</v>

98
00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:11.803
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which the state can do better than </v>

99
00:06:13.021 --> 00:06:18.021
<v Speaker 5>private industry or a better than the </v>
<v Speaker 5>local communities.</v>

100
00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:22.170
<v Speaker 5>And for me,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it also important when a,</v>

101
00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:23.343
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

102
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.920
<v Speaker 5>proposals,</v>
<v Speaker 5>changes of the,</v>

103
00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:27.063
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the constitution to all also </v>

104
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:33.580
<v Speaker 5>introduced a right of self determination</v>
<v Speaker 5>at every village in leakage.</v>

105
00:06:33.581 --> 00:06:38.220
<v Speaker 5>Dan Has the right to leave the standard </v>
<v Speaker 5>principality,</v>

106
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.413
<v Speaker 5>if they think that they get a better </v>
<v Speaker 5>offer from another country or if they </v>

107
00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:45.400
<v Speaker 5>can make more money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

108
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.770
<v Speaker 5>or lower taxation or God knows what,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if they become independent.</v>

109
00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.880
<v Speaker 5>And that was for me also important,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

110
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.013
<v Speaker 5>also for my successes and for the </v>
<v Speaker 5>politician to really to deliver very </v>

111
00:07:01.141 --> 00:07:06.141
<v Speaker 5>good service on low cost and therefore </v>
<v Speaker 5>low cost with low taxation.</v>

112
00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:08.460
<v Speaker 5>Do you think that</v>

113
00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.900
<v Speaker 3>lower cost is driven by competition?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

114
00:07:12.901 --> 00:07:13.734
<v Speaker 3>Between the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>my understanding is the local </v>

115
00:07:16.201 --> 00:07:18.640
<v Speaker 3>governments have of Lichtenstein is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

116
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:23.040
<v Speaker 3>they have a lot of self determination.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They're also competing with each other.</v>

117
00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:24.480
<v Speaker 3>Is that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>could you,</v>

118
00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.010
<v Speaker 3>could you tell me a little how that </v>
<v Speaker 3>works?</v>

119
00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the different.</v>

120
00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.310
<v Speaker 5>We have 11 villages,</v>
<v Speaker 5>basically a,</v>

121
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:35.860
<v Speaker 5>they compete on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>on,</v>

122
00:07:35.861 --> 00:07:38.710
<v Speaker 5>on taxation.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

123
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.720
<v Speaker 5>they compete on the way how they offer </v>
<v Speaker 5>the infrastructure.</v>

124
00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.753
<v Speaker 5>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give building sites to some industry </v>

125
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.073
<v Speaker 5>knows what.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So there is a certain competition </v>

126
00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.530
<v Speaker 5>services or whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So.</v>

127
00:07:59.531 --> 00:08:02.160
<v Speaker 5>So they compete on this issues </v>
<v Speaker 5>basically.</v>

128
00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:03.153
<v Speaker 3>So if I was a Vichtenstein Ian and I was</v>
<v Speaker 3>living here and I was looking at 11 </v>

129
00:08:07.721 --> 00:08:10.600
<v Speaker 3>different villages,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I feel,</v>

130
00:08:10.601 --> 00:08:11.470
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>again,</v>

131
00:08:11.471 --> 00:08:12.810
<v Speaker 3>relating to my experience,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

132
00:08:12.811 --> 00:08:13.644
<v Speaker 3>I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I basically have like one country where </v>

133
00:08:14.441 --> 00:08:16.510
<v Speaker 3>I grew up so I'm always going to relate </v>
<v Speaker 3>things to the UK.</v>

134
00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:17.880
<v Speaker 3>But I think about it if I,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if I,</v>

135
00:08:17.881 --> 00:08:18.714
<v Speaker 3>I grew up in a village called </v>
<v Speaker 3>headquarters and if like I guess in the </v>

136
00:08:20.501 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 3>next village over town or Canterbury or </v>
<v Speaker 3>whatever,</v>

137
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 3>I get pretty much the same deal is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's not going to be any different,</v>

138
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:27.333
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether I'm working for someone or </v>

139
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.110
<v Speaker 3>starting a business or applying to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>government for a permit to do something,</v>

140
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:32.973
<v Speaker 3>it's always going to be the same.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But here in Lichtenstein fi I can look </v>

141
00:08:35.621 --> 00:08:38.020
<v Speaker 3>at what the different villages are </v>
<v Speaker 3>offering and make a decision.</v>

142
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.930
<v Speaker 5>So religious said,</v>
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>

143
00:08:42.931 --> 00:08:46.270
<v Speaker 5>we have now enough manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 5>industry all,</v>

144
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:50.550
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>also enough foreignness.</v>

145
00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:55.580
<v Speaker 5>It was also quite an issue because if </v>
<v Speaker 5>you attract being the service,</v>

146
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:00.880
<v Speaker 5>the service instead of manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 5>industry with it,</v>

147
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:05.640
<v Speaker 5>you attract also workforce also from </v>
<v Speaker 5>outside.</v>

148
00:09:05.641 --> 00:09:08.220
<v Speaker 5>Because we cannot provide all the </v>
<v Speaker 5>workforce here.</v>

149
00:09:08.221 --> 00:09:10.950
<v Speaker 5>Not the specialist and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So basically,</v>

150
00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.860
<v Speaker 5>so there was no resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 5>No,</v>

151
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.050
<v Speaker 5>we have to stop and others took up the </v>
<v Speaker 5>chances and uh,</v>

152
00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:18.263
<v Speaker 5>we're able to attract a manufacturing or</v>
<v Speaker 5>service industries and therefore get </v>

153
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:28.191
<v Speaker 5>more income for the village and then off</v>
<v Speaker 5>of,</v>

154
00:09:29.250 --> 00:09:30.083
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>lower taxation or build a new road or a </v>

155
00:09:33.601 --> 00:09:38.601
<v Speaker 5>new school or a renovated church or God </v>
<v Speaker 5>knows whatever ideas they had.</v>

156
00:09:40.470 --> 00:09:41.303
<v Speaker 3>This works fantastically here,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but in a country as large as the United </v>

157
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:45.563
<v Speaker 3>States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UK,</v>

158
00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 3>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think this,</v>

159
00:09:47.281 --> 00:09:50.200
<v Speaker 3>is that right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>To self sovereignty and that right?</v>

160
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.410
<v Speaker 3>That works so well here in a small </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

161
00:09:52.411 --> 00:09:55.800
<v Speaker 3>Do you think they can work in,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in the constitution of,</v>

162
00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.570
<v Speaker 3>of a,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of a much larger country?</v>

163
00:09:57.810 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

164
00:10:00.571 --> 00:10:03.480
<v Speaker 5>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it in Switzerland.</v>

165
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:07.050
<v Speaker 5>They have it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they have this direct democracy,</v>

166
00:10:07.530 --> 00:10:12.530
<v Speaker 5>they have this decentralization </v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes depending on the can't on down</v>

167
00:10:12.661 --> 00:10:17.490
<v Speaker 5>to the small villages.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I've seen it to a certain degree also in</v>

168
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.580
<v Speaker 5>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 5>of course they're from state to state.</v>

169
00:10:21.030 --> 00:10:23.740
<v Speaker 5>It's a little bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

170
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:24.883
<v Speaker 5>but that influenced me very much and </v>
<v Speaker 5>thought that's basically a good system </v>

171
00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:36.810
<v Speaker 5>and a to give the people some say </v>
<v Speaker 5>because usually,</v>

172
00:10:36.811 --> 00:10:39.870
<v Speaker 5>especially in a very centralized states,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

173
00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:44.420
<v Speaker 5>as a politician or has a monarch or a </v>
<v Speaker 5>monitor,</v>

174
00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:45.363
<v Speaker 5>a ga or president or prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it takes so long until you realize that </v>

175
00:10:51.421 --> 00:10:56.421
<v Speaker 5>there's a problem and with that problems</v>
<v Speaker 5>pop up and suddenly you'll see,</v>

176
00:10:58.740 --> 00:11:01.800
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I didn't realize that they suddenly have</v>

177
00:11:01.801 --> 00:11:05.430
<v Speaker 5>an initiative being locally being on a </v>
<v Speaker 5>statewide level.</v>

178
00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:09.120
<v Speaker 5>And then you can solve those problems </v>
<v Speaker 5>bunch earlier</v>

179
00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:13.420
<v Speaker 3>and Lichtenstein for reference about </v>
<v Speaker 3>40,000</v>

180
00:11:13.421 --> 00:11:15.280
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So you go out there,</v>

181
00:11:15.281 --> 00:11:16.114
<v Speaker 3>you can gather these things.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's interesting because I feel this </v>

182
00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:25.060
<v Speaker 3>should be something if I can get a </v>
<v Speaker 3>thousand of my friends together and then</v>

183
00:11:25.061 --> 00:11:27.790
<v Speaker 3>put something forward and then </v>
<v Speaker 3>parliament have to discuss it.</v>

184
00:11:27.791 --> 00:11:32.260
<v Speaker 3>And if it's quite a smart idea of a </v>
<v Speaker 3>constitutional change at 1,500</v>

185
00:11:32.261 --> 00:11:33.094
<v Speaker 3>could happen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which,</v>

186
00:11:33.570 --> 00:11:35.020
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Primo Fasc,</v>

187
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:38.170
<v Speaker 3>you think this is going to be less </v>
<v Speaker 3>stable,</v>

188
00:11:38.260 --> 00:11:38.800
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>

189
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.633
<v Speaker 3>the immediate thought that comes into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the mind because anyone can change this </v>

190
00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:42.814
<v Speaker 3>right away.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But this doesn't happen here and it </v>

191
00:11:45.191 --> 00:11:47.890
<v Speaker 3>doesn't seem to happen in other places </v>
<v Speaker 3>that have a similar thing.</v>

192
00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.473
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think that is?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because many of those things are on the </v>

193
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:54.250
<v Speaker 3>local</v>

194
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.083
<v Speaker 5>basis and you have people who are in </v>
<v Speaker 5>favor of it against it and so all those </v>

195
00:12:01.331 --> 00:12:04.390
<v Speaker 5>things are much more discussed within </v>
<v Speaker 5>the population,</v>

196
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:09.391
<v Speaker 5>within the voting with the voters,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and I think that has turned out to be an</v>

197
00:12:11.051 --> 00:12:13.780
<v Speaker 5>advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 5>edited the stability.</v>

198
00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.970
<v Speaker 5>If I look at Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>for instance,</v>

199
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.043
<v Speaker 5>nevertheless I think that we have even a</v>
<v Speaker 5>vest assist in this was the possibility </v>

200
00:12:23.561 --> 00:12:25.840
<v Speaker 5>of a veto power,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but the reigning prince,</v>

201
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:29.123
<v Speaker 3>just to clarify the Swiss system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they also have a similar system of </v>

202
00:12:31.471 --> 00:12:35.470
<v Speaker 3>direct democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but obviously in a prince two visa,</v>

203
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:36.323
<v Speaker 3>it's now before continuing with this </v>
<v Speaker 3>interview where you wanted to get in </v>

204
00:12:42.871 --> 00:12:45.420
<v Speaker 3>touch with some politicians from </v>
<v Speaker 3>parliaments.</v>

205
00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:46.283
<v Speaker 3>The Flyer list,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the party is the most critical voice </v>

206
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.790
<v Speaker 3>inside of Lichtenstein's political </v>
<v Speaker 3>system</v>

207
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:57.300
<v Speaker 3>only has bonds actually used just sweet </v>
<v Speaker 3>to power.</v>

208
00:12:57.301 --> 00:13:00.540
<v Speaker 3>In 1961,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was a hunting law.</v>

209
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:03.090
<v Speaker 3>I have no idea,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it goes a little baby then,</v>

210
00:13:03.091 --> 00:13:03.924
<v Speaker 3>but it was about the hunting lawyers and</v>
<v Speaker 3>she didn't like that and he didn't </v>

211
00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.110
<v Speaker 3>signed the,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the law and that was it.</v>

212
00:13:10.440 --> 00:13:13.650
<v Speaker 3>He doesn't even have to say why he </v>
<v Speaker 3>doesn't sign.</v>

213
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:14.783
<v Speaker 3>It just doesn't sign.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And since then it hasn't really been </v>

214
00:13:17.041 --> 00:13:18.600
<v Speaker 3>necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

215
00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:23.880
<v Speaker 3>a threat to have to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to make use of the Meta powers of course</v>

216
00:13:23.881 --> 00:13:26.070
<v Speaker 3>has an effect on the working soft </v>
<v Speaker 3>department.</v>

217
00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:29.850
<v Speaker 3>So you have to get over,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you have to reach a consensus.</v>

218
00:13:29.851 --> 00:13:30.684
<v Speaker 3>It in Indiana.</v>

219
00:13:31.690 --> 00:13:35.320
<v Speaker 5>I thought that it will be worthwhile to </v>
<v Speaker 5>keep,</v>

220
00:13:35.890 --> 00:13:36.723
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the veto power of the reigning prince </v>

221
00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.233
<v Speaker 5>except for an initiative.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people want to abolish the monarchy </v>

222
00:13:45.340 --> 00:13:50.290
<v Speaker 5>because I saw that sometimes you had in </v>
<v Speaker 5>Switzerland votes,</v>

223
00:13:50.320 --> 00:13:54.520
<v Speaker 5>which were perhaps not in the long term </v>
<v Speaker 5>interest of the country,</v>

224
00:13:54.550 --> 00:13:57.660
<v Speaker 5>of the people,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the reigning prince.</v>

225
00:13:57.820 --> 00:13:59.710
<v Speaker 5>We think in generations.</v>

226
00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:01.123
<v Speaker 3>We had 15 or 20 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we had discussions about this dualism </v>

227
00:14:04.820 --> 00:14:09.170
<v Speaker 3>system and people wanted more power,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but at the end there was a,</v>

228
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.950
<v Speaker 3>there was a referendum and 65 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 3>the people said,</v>

229
00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:15.020
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let's keep it like it is.</v>

230
00:14:15.380 --> 00:14:20.380
<v Speaker 3>You could argue that democracy should </v>
<v Speaker 3>overrule the Monitor Archaic System,</v>

231
00:14:22.610 --> 00:14:24.470
<v Speaker 3>but it's the other way around at the </v>
<v Speaker 3>moment.</v>

232
00:14:24.471 --> 00:14:29.471
<v Speaker 3>And that has been decided by the people </v>
<v Speaker 3>referendums they often are,</v>

233
00:14:35.090 --> 00:14:36.710
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>with Brexit,</v>

234
00:14:36.711 --> 00:14:37.544
<v Speaker 3>it was like you just had the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to leave calling the people who </v>

235
00:14:39.951 --> 00:14:41.850
<v Speaker 3>wanted to stay calling the people who </v>
<v Speaker 3>wanted to leave.</v>

236
00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:47.180
<v Speaker 3>And it was kind of this ongoing theme in</v>
<v Speaker 3>relations to that.</v>

237
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:49.130
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how do you think,</v>

238
00:14:49.131 --> 00:14:49.964
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a country that has so many </v>

239
00:14:50.391 --> 00:14:54.230
<v Speaker 3>referendums that people can make </v>
<v Speaker 3>informed decisions</v>

240
00:14:54.410 --> 00:14:58.550
<v Speaker 5>at two things which we have to take.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You have to take into account before you</v>

241
00:14:58.551 --> 00:14:59.384
<v Speaker 5>introduce it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One is that you have to start on the </v>

242
00:15:04.341 --> 00:15:07.630
<v Speaker 5>local basis that people read,</v>
<v Speaker 5>really,</v>

243
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:10.860
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>get trained indoors,</v>

244
00:15:10.890 --> 00:15:14.560
<v Speaker 5>kind of direct democracy referendums.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Initiative said,</v>

245
00:15:14.561 --> 00:15:19.561
<v Speaker 5>saw where they can see what's the effect</v>
<v Speaker 5>of a stupid decision on the village.</v>

246
00:15:22.041 --> 00:15:23.330
<v Speaker 5>And the city,</v>
<v Speaker 5>whatever,</v>

247
00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.980
<v Speaker 5>so that they're seeing is,</v>
<v Speaker 5>is,</v>

248
00:15:26.270 --> 00:15:27.103
<v Speaker 5>is one aspect.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The other aspect is that you will have </v>

249
00:15:32.810 --> 00:15:37.810
<v Speaker 5>to inform the people quite a lot we have</v>
<v Speaker 5>in the law and also Switzerland that you</v>

250
00:15:40.770 --> 00:15:41.603
<v Speaker 5>as a Jew did to inform,</v>
<v Speaker 5>give the order information to have </v>

251
00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:49.090
<v Speaker 5>enough time for people to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

252
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:51.400
<v Speaker 5>before vote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

253
00:15:51.840 --> 00:15:54.350
<v Speaker 5>discussions and so on,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so that,</v>

254
00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.380
<v Speaker 5>that's very important and you have to </v>
<v Speaker 5>hand out all the information and neutral</v>

255
00:15:59.750 --> 00:16:00.583
<v Speaker 5>basis.</v>

256
00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:02.173
<v Speaker 3>I wanted to ask about that because it </v>
<v Speaker 3>seems often the information at least </v>

257
00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:11.380
<v Speaker 3>I've seen is handed out by whichever </v>
<v Speaker 3>newspaper you tend to subscribe to a how</v>

258
00:16:11.571 --> 00:16:12.404
<v Speaker 3>does that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how is that neutral information </v>

259
00:16:13.431 --> 00:16:14.870
<v Speaker 3>disseminated to the population</v>

260
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.860
<v Speaker 5>government?</v>
<v Speaker 5>All the village administration,</v>

261
00:16:17.861 --> 00:16:20.840
<v Speaker 5>if it's just on the local vote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>um,</v>

262
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:22.833
<v Speaker 5>has to hand out the information and </v>
<v Speaker 5>neutral information where both sides </v>

263
00:16:28.391 --> 00:16:29.400
<v Speaker 5>can,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

264
00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:32.830
<v Speaker 5>put this information.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's a,</v>

265
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:37.270
<v Speaker 5>then they can also put their own view </v>
<v Speaker 5>into there.</v>

266
00:16:38.080 --> 00:16:43.080
<v Speaker 5>So that's handed out to all the voters </v>
<v Speaker 5>so they can look it up.</v>

267
00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:48.810
<v Speaker 5>They organize meetings and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So before such a vote,</v>

268
00:16:48.850 --> 00:16:52.990
<v Speaker 5>it's really.</v>
<v Speaker 5>That seems people are well informed.</v>

269
00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:53.970
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

270
00:16:53.970 --> 00:16:55.750
<v Speaker 3>Those,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't know,</v>

271
00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:58.310
<v Speaker 3>whenever I tend to read stuff written by</v>
<v Speaker 3>government,</v>

272
00:16:58.311 --> 00:16:59.144
<v Speaker 3>it's as an,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think of myself as reasonably </v>

273
00:17:01.071 --> 00:17:04.790
<v Speaker 3>intelligence and I read some of this </v>
<v Speaker 3>stuff,</v>

274
00:17:04.791 --> 00:17:06.990
<v Speaker 3>but I'm like,</v>
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>

275
00:17:07.790 --> 00:17:08.623
<v Speaker 3>like it's governments can be verbose and</v>
<v Speaker 3>they're not perhaps the best at writing </v>

276
00:17:13.131 --> 00:17:13.964
<v Speaker 3>things in an easy to understand way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is this information presented in a way </v>

277
00:17:17.241 --> 00:17:17.960
<v Speaker 3>that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

278
00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:19.940
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't require a degree to </v>
<v Speaker 3>understand.</v>

279
00:17:19.941 --> 00:17:23.030
<v Speaker 3>It's kind of like his how it is for the </v>
<v Speaker 3>every man</v>

280
00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:25.873
<v Speaker 5>in your own interest.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you read in a stupid way or the </v>

281
00:17:29.811 --> 00:17:33.230
<v Speaker 5>highway which nobody understands is </v>
<v Speaker 5>going to be rejected,</v>

282
00:17:33.710 --> 00:17:36.160
<v Speaker 5>right?</v>
<v Speaker 5>The people writing this,</v>

283
00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:44.350
<v Speaker 5>of course you have to check that the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the right correct way and you can appeal</v>

284
00:17:44.871 --> 00:17:45.704
<v Speaker 5>to the,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>

285
00:17:45.890 --> 00:17:46.790
<v Speaker 5>to,</v>
<v Speaker 5>to court.</v>

286
00:17:48.560 --> 00:17:53.110
<v Speaker 5>So if there's wrong information in,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was cool.</v>

287
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.320
<v Speaker 5>Separation of powers now,</v>
<v Speaker 5>right</v>

288
00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:18.420
<v Speaker 3>as I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Lichtenstein by by various measures,</v>

289
00:18:18.421 --> 00:18:21.270
<v Speaker 3>the highest GDP per capita in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So very,</v>

290
00:18:21.271 --> 00:18:22.104
<v Speaker 3>very wealthy country and we've been </v>
<v Speaker 3>walking around and it's reflected in </v>

291
00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:29.550
<v Speaker 3>beautifully clean streets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Just a lovely looking place.</v>

292
00:18:29.730 --> 00:18:32.490
<v Speaker 3>But it wasn't always like this was it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it was,</v>

293
00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.990
<v Speaker 3>it was quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So,</v>

294
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:35.023
<v Speaker 3>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I think I read kind of agrarian was the </v>

295
00:18:37.550 --> 00:18:40.500
<v Speaker 3>time.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Can you tell me a little bit about,</v>

296
00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.750
<v Speaker 3>about the history of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>of Lichtenstein,</v>

297
00:18:42.751 --> 00:18:44.400
<v Speaker 3>kind of before,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

298
00:18:44.401 --> 00:18:47.370
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's relatively recent economic success,</v>

299
00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:48.713
<v Speaker 5>what will know from my predecessor </v>
<v Speaker 5>around 1700 bought the governing the </v>

300
00:18:53.211 --> 00:18:54.044
<v Speaker 5>rights of those.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There were two counties in the holy </v>

301
00:18:56.911 --> 00:18:57.744
<v Speaker 5>Roman Empire.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was basically have a road bike </v>

302
00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.240
<v Speaker 5>exercise because you voted to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>emperor.</v>

303
00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:09.020
<v Speaker 5>And so for him to get more influence in </v>
<v Speaker 5>the holy Roman Empire as a prince of the</v>

304
00:19:10.111 --> 00:19:14.820
<v Speaker 5>holy Roman Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a he bold those voting rights because it</v>

305
00:19:14.821 --> 00:19:16.190
<v Speaker 5>was very poor.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And,</v>

306
00:19:16.230 --> 00:19:20.160
<v Speaker 5>and the families who were raining then </v>
<v Speaker 5>went bankrupt.</v>

307
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.060
<v Speaker 5>He could have cross support by his huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>estates.</v>

308
00:19:24.090 --> 00:19:25.710
<v Speaker 5>It was no problem.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

309
00:19:25.711 --> 00:19:26.544
<v Speaker 5>those,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

310
00:19:26.580 --> 00:19:30.240
<v Speaker 5>two counties and put them together,</v>
<v Speaker 5>made the principality,</v>

311
00:19:30.241 --> 00:19:30.970
<v Speaker 5>artificial.</v>

312
00:19:30.970 --> 00:19:33.880
<v Speaker 3>So if he,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he buys the lands because the possession</v>

313
00:19:33.881 --> 00:19:35.860
<v Speaker 3>of the land is what gives him the voting</v>
<v Speaker 3>rights.</v>

314
00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:37.813
<v Speaker 5>Not traded the procession of the lag,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but it was the reigning powers over the </v>

315
00:19:45.621 --> 00:19:47.840
<v Speaker 5>land.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

316
00:19:47.860 --> 00:19:52.460
<v Speaker 5>So the land will still be partly in </v>
<v Speaker 5>private ownership.</v>

317
00:19:54.250 --> 00:19:55.083
<v Speaker 5>That was separated.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was some kind of private who bought </v>

318
00:20:02.930 --> 00:20:07.930
<v Speaker 5>some counties have accounts here who </v>
<v Speaker 5>went bankrupt and to pay for the.</v>

319
00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:12.080
<v Speaker 5>For the people who vote,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they owed money.</v>

320
00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.693
<v Speaker 5>Then there was a court in the holy Roman</v>
<v Speaker 5>Empire where they just sort of </v>

321
00:20:17.650 --> 00:20:22.650
<v Speaker 5>auctioning off the governing rights and </v>
<v Speaker 5>my free says a 17 century laws,</v>

322
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.840
<v Speaker 5>very rich,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and he paid the highest price for that.</v>

323
00:20:33.300 --> 00:20:34.133
<v Speaker 3>So it wasn't.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In a way it was still private lands </v>

324
00:20:35.991 --> 00:20:36.631
<v Speaker 3>ownership.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was.</v>

325
00:20:36.631 --> 00:20:40.560
<v Speaker 3>He was buying the governing rights or </v>
<v Speaker 3>you for what is today?</v>

326
00:20:40.561 --> 00:20:41.520
<v Speaker 3>Lichtenstein?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

327
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:45.050
<v Speaker 5>Nobody was really interested here in the</v>
<v Speaker 5>land.</v>

328
00:20:45.470 --> 00:20:50.470
<v Speaker 5>The first one to move here to finish,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that was my father in 1938 and the first</v>

329
00:20:52.691 --> 00:20:56.960
<v Speaker 5>of all to wizard what one of his answers</v>
<v Speaker 5>to the predecessor bought.</v>

330
00:20:57.190 --> 00:20:58.023
<v Speaker 5>He came there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think when the railway was built </v>

331
00:21:02.410 --> 00:21:03.243
<v Speaker 5>throughout Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>sometimes in the middle of the 19th </v>

332
00:21:05.651 --> 00:21:07.090
<v Speaker 5>century,</v>
<v Speaker 5>so</v>

333
00:21:07.270 --> 00:21:12.270
<v Speaker 6>hundreds of now I could go visit.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not that I've purchased.</v>

334
00:21:13.430 --> 00:21:14.263
<v Speaker 6>What's that?</v>

335
00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.621
<v Speaker 5>They?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Of course,</v>

336
00:21:16.621 --> 00:21:17.454
<v Speaker 5>they always.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They nominate someone to represent them </v>

337
00:21:19.681 --> 00:21:24.110
<v Speaker 5>and they paid for the people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They introduced reforms.</v>

338
00:21:24.150 --> 00:21:24.983
<v Speaker 5>They paid for dedication of people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One of the first countries to introduce </v>

339
00:21:29.850 --> 00:21:34.850
<v Speaker 5>a bonus free educational educational on </v>
<v Speaker 5>a statewide basis.</v>

340
00:21:35.580 --> 00:21:37.800
<v Speaker 5>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we'll try to develop it.</v>

341
00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:38.903
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

342
00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:41.070
<v Speaker 3>So it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it existed at that point in your,</v>

343
00:21:41.071 --> 00:21:43.350
<v Speaker 3>you said your father was the first one </v>
<v Speaker 3>to move here.</v>

344
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:44.491
<v Speaker 3>What,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why?</v>

345
00:21:44.491 --> 00:21:45.324
<v Speaker 3>What changed is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was it around the time of the war or </v>

346
00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:48.630
<v Speaker 3>whatever?</v>

347
00:21:48.630 --> 00:21:50.160
<v Speaker 5>Of course it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>what?</v>

348
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.040
<v Speaker 5>Basically the family lived on the huge </v>
<v Speaker 5>estates,</v>

349
00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:57.960
<v Speaker 5>what is now the Czech Republic and all </v>
<v Speaker 5>the palace in Vienna,</v>

350
00:21:58.550 --> 00:22:01.970
<v Speaker 5>whole summer states in Australia still.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

351
00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:03.270
<v Speaker 5>but then,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

352
00:22:03.630 --> 00:22:05.130
<v Speaker 5>when,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

353
00:22:06.060 --> 00:22:07.800
<v Speaker 5>Hitler,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

354
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.860
<v Speaker 5>took over Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 5>well,</v>

355
00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:13.933
<v Speaker 5>didn't know what would happen with </v>
<v Speaker 5>lifting and when the German troops </v>

356
00:22:17.481 --> 00:22:22.481
<v Speaker 5>marched into Austria by a father who was</v>
<v Speaker 5>not yet during prince,</v>

357
00:22:24.010 --> 00:22:29.010
<v Speaker 5>his,</v>
<v Speaker 5>his great uncle was married to a Jewish,</v>

358
00:22:30.210 --> 00:22:34.780
<v Speaker 5>a barrow nes family was very much anti </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazi for</v>

359
00:22:37.260 --> 00:22:42.260
<v Speaker 6>see what the married to a baron.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's probably not best friends.</v>

360
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:48.440
<v Speaker 5>The randy prints flat to Czechoslovakia </v>
<v Speaker 5>over the boulder.</v>

361
00:22:49.010 --> 00:22:54.010
<v Speaker 5>And my father drove his car,</v>
<v Speaker 5>met the German troops marching towards a</v>

362
00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.420
<v Speaker 5>Vienna and try to stabilize it here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

363
00:23:01.310 --> 00:23:03.350
<v Speaker 5>Luckily he succeeded that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

364
00:23:03.430 --> 00:23:06.950
<v Speaker 5>we were not the next.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There was a small,</v>

365
00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:08.283
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>there was a small attempt of a coup </v>

366
00:23:09.901 --> 00:23:14.770
<v Speaker 5>d'etat he unleashed when Nazi party,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

367
00:23:14.780 --> 00:23:19.340
<v Speaker 5>when my father,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think in 1938 just before the outbreak</v>

368
00:23:19.341 --> 00:23:21.500
<v Speaker 5>of World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the small,</v>

369
00:23:21.510 --> 00:23:26.300
<v Speaker 5>not Nazi party by the support of some </v>
<v Speaker 5>Nazi people outside,</v>

370
00:23:26.430 --> 00:23:31.430
<v Speaker 5>I seem to governor have to roll and fall</v>
<v Speaker 5>back or southern Germany support that.</v>

371
00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:37.490
<v Speaker 5>They tried to make a mark on the dots </v>
<v Speaker 5>like the march on Rome,</v>

372
00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.020
<v Speaker 5>but to do cheer.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>

373
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:45.140
<v Speaker 5>Was a bad copy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Bold boat.</v>

374
00:23:45.150 --> 00:23:48.760
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But then the people heard about it stuff</v>

375
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.710
<v Speaker 5>because you couldn't keep it secret.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

376
00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.490
<v Speaker 5>so people came together.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The farmers at that time,</v>

377
00:23:55.520 --> 00:23:58.000
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 5>with all the instruments there,</v>

378
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:03.130
<v Speaker 5>hydrocodone forks and all the lawsuits </v>
<v Speaker 5>on this around the country.</v>

379
00:24:07.340 --> 00:24:08.600
<v Speaker 5>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I failed.</v>

380
00:24:09.980 --> 00:24:10.813
<v Speaker 5>Fascinating.</v>

381
00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:12.003
<v Speaker 3>Your father was,</v>
<v Speaker 3>was here and he established what exists </v>

382
00:24:15.821 --> 00:24:16.660
<v Speaker 3>today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>essentially.</v>

383
00:24:16.940 --> 00:24:17.773
<v Speaker 5>That's right when the reigning princes </v>
<v Speaker 5>came to visit before they build a villa </v>

384
00:24:23.301 --> 00:24:25.290
<v Speaker 5>up here.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>

385
00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:26.353
<v Speaker 5>but they came with settlement.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was only built in the second half of </v>

386
00:24:29.151 --> 00:24:31.730
<v Speaker 5>the 19th century when the first came to </v>
<v Speaker 5>visit.</v>

387
00:24:32.210 --> 00:24:33.043
<v Speaker 5>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but then the people wanted to have the </v>

388
00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.250
<v Speaker 5>costal,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

389
00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:37.153
<v Speaker 5>which was before a museum adapted so </v>
<v Speaker 5>that it will be residents or three </v>

390
00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.930
<v Speaker 5>prints and this is where we are and </v>
<v Speaker 5>that's where we are</v>

391
00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.170
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most people think that Lichtenstein just</v>

392
00:24:52.171 --> 00:24:56.040
<v Speaker 1>became rich because of that low taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and their secret banking laws.</v>

393
00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.440
<v Speaker 1>But this couldn't be further from </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>

394
00:24:58.470 --> 00:25:00.810
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the financial sector does play</v>

395
00:25:00.811 --> 00:25:04.290
<v Speaker 1>a big role here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in fact the industrial sector is the</v>

396
00:25:04.291 --> 00:25:05.124
<v Speaker 1>biggest economic power in Lichtenstein.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard of the company Hilti or </v>

397
00:25:08.191 --> 00:25:09.610
<v Speaker 1>Ivr called Viva dense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

398
00:25:09.611 --> 00:25:12.180
<v Speaker 1>if you haven't heard of that latter one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the next time you go into the dentist,</v>

399
00:25:12.181 --> 00:25:14.250
<v Speaker 1>have a look at the brands of tools they </v>
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>

400
00:25:14.310 --> 00:25:16.800
<v Speaker 1>most likely they were made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lichtenstein</v>

401
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.880
<v Speaker 7>to hitting system of the company that is</v>
<v Speaker 7>still in the Buckingham Palace.</v>

402
00:25:22.890 --> 00:25:23.723
<v Speaker 7>I,</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm guessing that they updated it from </v>

403
00:25:24.861 --> 00:25:26.630
<v Speaker 7>this version already,</v>
<v Speaker 7>but yes,</v>

404
00:25:26.631 --> 00:25:30.250
<v Speaker 7>the Buckingham Palace is heated by a </v>
<v Speaker 7>heating system out of leakage Stein.</v>

405
00:25:30.570 --> 00:25:32.920
<v Speaker 5>So we were,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we were kind of talking and we,</v>

406
00:25:32.930 --> 00:25:33.763
<v Speaker 5>we spoke with other people as well about</v>
<v Speaker 5>the employment situation in licked </v>

407
00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:38.460
<v Speaker 5>strikes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's about 40,000</v>

408
00:25:38.461 --> 00:25:42.810
<v Speaker 5>people in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but a lot of people come from around two</v>

409
00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:45.090
<v Speaker 5>to work here kind of as a commute.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Right.</v>

410
00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:49.650
<v Speaker 7>Lichtenstein actually has more.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I'm working places.</v>

411
00:25:49.651 --> 00:25:53.160
<v Speaker 7>Then we have inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So we have roughly 38,000</v>

412
00:25:53.161 --> 00:25:55.880
<v Speaker 7>inhabitants and 39,000</v>
<v Speaker 7>chops.</v>

413
00:25:56.610 --> 00:25:57.443
<v Speaker 7>That means we are heavily dependent on </v>
<v Speaker 7>commuters that come into the country </v>

414
00:26:00.001 --> 00:26:01.860
<v Speaker 7>each day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>I think it's about 20,000</v>

415
00:26:01.861 --> 00:26:02.694
<v Speaker 7>people that come here each day.</v>
<v Speaker 7>And what are these people typically </v>

416
00:26:06.181 --> 00:26:07.560
<v Speaker 7>doing?</v>
<v Speaker 7>Um,</v>

417
00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:12.590
<v Speaker 7>most of them work in the industries in </v>
<v Speaker 7>like a 40 biggest companies like Hilti,</v>

418
00:26:13.650 --> 00:26:16.690
<v Speaker 7>like the evil Claude or the to some </v>
<v Speaker 7>crooked presta</v>

419
00:26:16.990 --> 00:26:19.990
<v Speaker 3>related to the economy of Lichtenstein.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And you know,</v>

420
00:26:20.870 --> 00:26:22.810
<v Speaker 3>I appreciate the history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Things I didn't,</v>

421
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.750
<v Speaker 3>didn't even know after doing the </v>
<v Speaker 3>research role of this.</v>

422
00:26:25.751 --> 00:26:27.310
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what,</v>

423
00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:32.380
<v Speaker 3>what kind of drove the change from the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Agrarian Lichtenstein from I suppose,</v>

424
00:26:32.381 --> 00:26:33.214
<v Speaker 3>how it was before your father arrived in</v>
<v Speaker 3>and set things up here to Lichtenstein </v>

425
00:26:36.581 --> 00:26:40.450
<v Speaker 3>as it is today because while it was at </v>
<v Speaker 3>60 or 70 years,</v>

426
00:26:40.451 --> 00:26:41.500
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in a way,</v>

427
00:26:41.501 --> 00:26:43.040
<v Speaker 3>it's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that seems like a lot of time.</v>

428
00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:47.040
<v Speaker 3>It's and not a lot of time for such a </v>
<v Speaker 3>dramatic transformation.</v>

429
00:26:48.140 --> 00:26:48.973
<v Speaker 5>I think there are several factors which </v>
<v Speaker 5>were important are one factor was </v>

430
00:26:53.580 --> 00:26:54.413
<v Speaker 5>already in the 19th century when one of </v>
<v Speaker 5>my predecessors introduced a general </v>

431
00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:06.090
<v Speaker 5>schooling career,</v>
<v Speaker 5>one of the first states to introduce it,</v>

432
00:27:06.091 --> 00:27:11.091
<v Speaker 5>I think worldwide a thing in Europe </v>
<v Speaker 5>because on thought because it was a poor</v>

433
00:27:12.181 --> 00:27:16.140
<v Speaker 5>country relying on the subsidies of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>reigning prints.</v>

434
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.333
<v Speaker 5>So at least we should educate the people</v>
<v Speaker 5>so they can find a job outside of Stan </v>

435
00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:23.620
<v Speaker 5>if they don't find one.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Insight.</v>

436
00:27:24.180 --> 00:27:28.560
<v Speaker 5>One kept the uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>taxation as low as possible.</v>

437
00:27:28.561 --> 00:27:33.500
<v Speaker 5>So to attract business one was then able</v>
<v Speaker 5>to make a way of Allah.</v>

438
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:34.673
<v Speaker 5>The customers treat you with the Austin </v>
<v Speaker 5>Hungarian Empire that opened up the big </v>

439
00:27:39.660 --> 00:27:42.990
<v Speaker 5>market before for the local market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Hopeless,</v>

440
00:27:43.490 --> 00:27:44.323
<v Speaker 5>small too small.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So with access to this large market or </v>

441
00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:53.340
<v Speaker 5>one could attract a Swiss textile </v>
<v Speaker 5>industry.</v>

442
00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:56.700
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 5>because it's a across the border,</v>

443
00:27:56.760 --> 00:28:00.150
<v Speaker 5>but next to it.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But there was a free trade with that.</v>

444
00:28:00.210 --> 00:28:02.400
<v Speaker 5>Otherwise they would have had to pay </v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes.</v>

445
00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:03.463
<v Speaker 3>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm just thinking of the similarities </v>

446
00:28:05.811 --> 00:28:08.720
<v Speaker 3>with today,</v>
<v Speaker 3>kind of how in the past it was,</v>

447
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.660
<v Speaker 3>we're a very small country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We want to trade with Austria,</v>

448
00:28:11.661 --> 00:28:12.494
<v Speaker 3>Hungary,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and now it's like European Union in a </v>

449
00:28:15.821 --> 00:28:16.820
<v Speaker 3>way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a similar thing.</v>

450
00:28:16.821 --> 00:28:20.240
<v Speaker 3>You have your small country and we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we saw a healthy,</v>

451
00:28:20.260 --> 00:28:22.340
<v Speaker 3>the tool manufacturers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the dental stuff,</v>

452
00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.170
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a low taxation,</v>

453
00:28:24.171 --> 00:28:25.610
<v Speaker 3>which is something we'll discuss in a </v>
<v Speaker 3>bit.</v>

454
00:28:26.030 --> 00:28:29.690
<v Speaker 3>People I think often have these,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these notions where they're like,</v>

455
00:28:29.691 --> 00:28:31.250
<v Speaker 3>they think of something and they're </v>
<v Speaker 3>like,</v>

456
00:28:31.280 --> 00:28:32.113
<v Speaker 3>why is the place rich and Switzerland </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than the Lichtenstein as an </v>

457
00:28:34.911 --> 00:28:36.230
<v Speaker 3>example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>low taxes.</v>

458
00:28:36.231 --> 00:28:37.064
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But the reality is that it's often more </v>

459
00:28:38.781 --> 00:28:40.900
<v Speaker 3>than that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether it's education of an education.</v>

460
00:28:42.770 --> 00:28:45.950
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And then also access to the markets.</v>

461
00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:49.140
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 5>If you don't have access to market.</v>

462
00:28:49.440 --> 00:28:53.970
<v Speaker 5>We couldn't even feed our own people.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They were dependent on subsidies,</v>

463
00:28:53.971 --> 00:28:58.590
<v Speaker 5>better any prints,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and of course it became better.</v>

464
00:28:59.010 --> 00:29:04.010
<v Speaker 5>Result really was fine with anger an </v>
<v Speaker 5>empire and then after it collapsed.</v>

465
00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.213
<v Speaker 5>Luckily we got the same three d with </v>
<v Speaker 5>Switzerland and I was able to push </v>

466
00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:14.331
<v Speaker 5>through thanks to the Eric Democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the European economic market,</v>

467
00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:15.413
<v Speaker 5>because there was a lot of resistance,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a government and parliament and would </v>

468
00:29:20.421 --> 00:29:21.254
<v Speaker 5>not have gotten through that.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But with direct democracy I was able to </v>

469
00:29:24.811 --> 00:29:28.100
<v Speaker 5>put it into to a popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So I brought this.</v>

470
00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:30.960
<v Speaker 7>We have several advantages here in </v>
<v Speaker 7>Lichtenstein.</v>

471
00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.123
<v Speaker 7>One is that the taxes are not too high.</v>
<v Speaker 7>The other is we are actually in the </v>

472
00:29:36.450 --> 00:29:37.370
<v Speaker 7>middle of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well,</v>

473
00:29:37.710 --> 00:29:42.400
<v Speaker 7>you've seen the distance since you're.</v>
<v Speaker 7>You're everywhere within no time,</v>

474
00:29:42.430 --> 00:29:44.260
<v Speaker 7>right?</v>
<v Speaker 7>We're staying in Switzerland while we're</v>

475
00:29:44.261 --> 00:29:46.380
<v Speaker 7>here in Lichtenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 7>just over the border,</v>

476
00:29:46.460 --> 00:29:49.420
<v Speaker 7>as you were mentioning the people </v>
<v Speaker 7>commuting from Austria and Germany,</v>

477
00:29:49.750 --> 00:29:50.583
<v Speaker 7>so race in the middle.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We are also located in two different </v>

478
00:29:53.890 --> 00:29:58.660
<v Speaker 7>economic areas at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 7>so we have very easy access to the Swiss</v>

479
00:29:58.661 --> 00:29:59.494
<v Speaker 7>economic area and.</v>
<v Speaker 7>But we're also part of the European </v>

480
00:30:02.171 --> 00:30:03.400
<v Speaker 7>economic area.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Right,</v>

481
00:30:03.490 --> 00:30:07.360
<v Speaker 7>right next door to the EU,</v>
<v Speaker 7>right next door to Switzerland.</v>

482
00:30:07.810 --> 00:30:08.643
<v Speaker 7>And we have both.</v>
<v Speaker 7>We have contracts that makes it very </v>

483
00:30:11.291 --> 00:30:12.660
<v Speaker 7>easy.</v>
<v Speaker 7>So if you like,</v>

484
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:13.923
<v Speaker 7>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 7>if you have an insurance company and it </v>

485
00:30:16.271 --> 00:30:17.104
<v Speaker 7>is based in Lichtenstein,</v>
<v Speaker 7>you just need one office to work in </v>

486
00:30:19.961 --> 00:30:20.794
<v Speaker 7>Switzerland and in the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 7>Well if you don't have it in </v>

487
00:30:23.630 --> 00:30:26.710
<v Speaker 7>Lichtenstein and then you need two </v>
<v Speaker 7>separate offices,</v>

488
00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:50.470
<v Speaker 3>I think that the removal of the secret </v>
<v Speaker 3>banking that was who was here before.</v>

489
00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:52.123
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that affected </v>

490
00:30:53.061 --> 00:30:55.400
<v Speaker 3>Lichtenstein's economy much?</v>

491
00:30:55.940 --> 00:30:56.773
<v Speaker 5>What it reduced for short terms a tax </v>
<v Speaker 5>income against my more pessimistic look </v>

492
00:31:10.531 --> 00:31:11.364
<v Speaker 5>at it,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was very much in favor of opening it </v>

493
00:31:13.621 --> 00:31:14.454
<v Speaker 5>up because it exposes so much criticism </v>
<v Speaker 5>of those banks or the financial </v>

494
00:31:21.841 --> 00:31:24.090
<v Speaker 5>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They recovered after two,</v>

495
00:31:24.091 --> 00:31:28.410
<v Speaker 5>three years perhaps also because they </v>
<v Speaker 5>always said,</v>

496
00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:29.393
<v Speaker 5>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>we're not going to be able to apportion </v>

497
00:31:31.620 --> 00:31:32.453
<v Speaker 5>this begging secrecy,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which was introduced sometime before </v>

498
00:31:35.941 --> 00:31:38.250
<v Speaker 5>world war two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but Swiss and so on.</v>

499
00:31:38.610 --> 00:31:42.700
<v Speaker 5>So that that's changing though.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You will have really two,</v>

500
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:43.703
<v Speaker 5>two,</v>
<v Speaker 5>if you want to survive in the long term </v>

501
00:31:45.570 --> 00:31:46.403
<v Speaker 5>as a bank or in the financial industry,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you will have to offer good service for </v>

502
00:31:51.570 --> 00:31:56.570
<v Speaker 5>people who are willing to pay also that </v>
<v Speaker 5>taxes in their home country.</v>

503
00:31:57.270 --> 00:31:58.470
<v Speaker 5>I think that's another thing that</v>

504
00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.550
<v Speaker 3>that I picked up on was with these </v>
<v Speaker 3>smaller states,</v>

505
00:32:01.551 --> 00:32:03.800
<v Speaker 3>you can really focus on,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>

506
00:32:04.370 --> 00:32:05.203
<v Speaker 3>instead of like you say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the reality is this is the way the </v>

507
00:32:08.331 --> 00:32:09.164
<v Speaker 3>world's going.</v>
<v Speaker 3>People need to be open with their </v>

508
00:32:10.911 --> 00:32:12.770
<v Speaker 3>finances.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is how it's going to,</v>

509
00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:13.873
<v Speaker 3>how it's going to be,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and then you could switch to a focus on </v>

510
00:32:16.071 --> 00:32:20.060
<v Speaker 3>let's do really good banking.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Let's be really excellent banks.</v>

511
00:32:20.061 --> 00:32:20.894
<v Speaker 3>Let's not be generic.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Giant Bank won't pick up the phone on </v>

512
00:32:25.130 --> 00:32:26.540
<v Speaker 3>Saturday morning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so you,</v>

513
00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.670
<v Speaker 3>that's be really good at this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Which is important.</v>

514
00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:32.193
<v Speaker 3>Do you think that's another one of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>reasons why you know Lichtenstein is an </v>

515
00:32:35.001 --> 00:32:35.834
<v Speaker 3>economy has done so well because you can</v>
<v Speaker 3>focus on doing things really rather </v>

516
00:32:39.771 --> 00:32:40.604
<v Speaker 3>than.</v>

517
00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:42.290
<v Speaker 5>I think so,</v>
<v Speaker 5>yes.</v>

518
00:32:42.291 --> 00:32:46.040
<v Speaker 5>I think it was the education system.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It was low taxation.</v>

519
00:32:46.700 --> 00:32:51.700
<v Speaker 5>It was the realization that you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>only be able to survive in a small,</v>

520
00:32:54.460 --> 00:32:58.880
<v Speaker 5>a small country in an economy with no </v>
<v Speaker 5>whole market.</v>

521
00:32:58.990 --> 00:33:03.990
<v Speaker 5>You had to compete on the world markets </v>
<v Speaker 5>to survive and nobody's going to protect</v>

522
00:33:05.271 --> 00:33:06.104
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The government cannot afford to support </v>

523
00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:12.460
<v Speaker 5>one of our larger manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 5>companies that we read.</v>

524
00:33:12.650 --> 00:33:13.483
<v Speaker 5>We just,</v>
<v Speaker 5>then we would have to raise taxes and </v>

525
00:33:17.091 --> 00:33:18.720
<v Speaker 5>there will be immediately,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

526
00:33:19.120 --> 00:33:20.390
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

527
00:33:20.391 --> 00:33:23.390
<v Speaker 5>an initiative but the people in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>popular vote.</v>

528
00:33:23.510 --> 00:33:24.343
<v Speaker 5>Why,</v>
<v Speaker 5>why should we pay more taxes to support </v>

529
00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.800
<v Speaker 5>Mr Archbold,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mr Hill,</v>

530
00:33:31.040 --> 00:33:32.210
<v Speaker 5>Mr Mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Mr.</v>

531
00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.490
<v Speaker 5>whatever Mueller.</v>

532
00:33:34.340 --> 00:33:39.340
<v Speaker 3>This is why like your system,</v>
<v Speaker 3>because I feel this sometimes happens in</v>

533
00:33:40.580 --> 00:33:42.140
<v Speaker 3>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Maybe my is.</v>

534
00:33:42.680 --> 00:33:45.080
<v Speaker 3>We didn't really get to say it's like A.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

535
00:33:45.081 --> 00:33:45.880
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>um,</v>

536
00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:47.720
<v Speaker 3>we,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we just gave them loads of money because</v>

537
00:33:47.721 --> 00:33:49.330
<v Speaker 3>they were in trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Um,</v>

538
00:33:50.250 --> 00:33:51.890
<v Speaker 3>Le Pen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>trump,</v>

539
00:33:51.950 --> 00:33:54.080
<v Speaker 3>UKIP.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why now do you,</v>

540
00:33:54.081 --> 00:33:56.870
<v Speaker 3>do you have an opinion on why?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Why do you think this is happening now?</v>

541
00:33:56.930 --> 00:34:01.930
<v Speaker 5>We see changes in the whole system of </v>
<v Speaker 5>indirect democracy.</v>

542
00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.150
<v Speaker 5>People get more detached.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Everything has become more complicated.</v>

543
00:34:08.151 --> 00:34:08.984
<v Speaker 5>You have globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 5>There's not so much possibility to </v>

544
00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:13.783
<v Speaker 5>decide only for your state.</v>
<v Speaker 5>All that makes people very unhappy and </v>

545
00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:21.853
<v Speaker 5>therefore populism easy solutions that </v>
<v Speaker 5>people never really had looked much and </v>

546
00:34:27.260 --> 00:34:30.350
<v Speaker 5>why this law or that law like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Switzerland or here,</v>

547
00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:34.580
<v Speaker 5>there was also in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 5>populist movements to certain degree on,</v>

548
00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:36.073
<v Speaker 5>on immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but that quietened down when it will </v>

549
00:34:38.871 --> 00:34:39.704
<v Speaker 5>solve more or less and here divorce,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but not much and that I think is </v>

550
00:34:45.411 --> 00:34:50.411
<v Speaker 5>something that has somehow tried me for </v>
<v Speaker 5>quite some time.</v>

551
00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.023
<v Speaker 5>Those states who are,</v>
<v Speaker 5>in my opinion to certainly over </v>

552
00:34:57.431 --> 00:34:58.264
<v Speaker 5>centralized an ultra filling anymore the</v>
<v Speaker 5>duties which are expected from the </v>

553
00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.200
<v Speaker 5>people and that creates populism and,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and,</v>

554
00:35:08.220 --> 00:35:09.053
<v Speaker 5>and easy.</v>
<v Speaker 5>So you and things like this and I think </v>

555
00:35:12.460 --> 00:35:16.230
<v Speaker 5>I've seen a lot of easy solutions.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The appeal of easy solution,</v>

556
00:35:16.920 --> 00:35:20.510
<v Speaker 5>is it a solution?</v>
<v Speaker 5>And very often they're catastrophists.</v>

557
00:35:20.540 --> 00:35:21.373
<v Speaker 5>Yes.</v>

558
00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:27.120
<v Speaker 3>Narrowly avoided sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think increasing globalization,</v>

559
00:35:31.781 --> 00:35:34.540
<v Speaker 3>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>maybe really is going to lead to more of</v>

560
00:35:34.541 --> 00:35:35.374
<v Speaker 3>this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think this is something we're </v>

561
00:35:36.101 --> 00:35:38.070
<v Speaker 3>going to see continue?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Do you think this is</v>

562
00:35:38.070 --> 00:35:38.903
<v Speaker 5>kind of a something we're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 5>fade away as people perhaps realize </v>

563
00:35:42.751 --> 00:35:43.584
<v Speaker 5>that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

564
00:35:44.190 --> 00:35:45.023
<v Speaker 5>once we've elected a populous,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're not all they're cracked up to </v>

565
00:35:46.531 --> 00:35:47.550
<v Speaker 5>be,</v>
<v Speaker 5>it's,</v>

566
00:35:47.610 --> 00:35:48.443
<v Speaker 5>I don't think it's going to fade away </v>
<v Speaker 5>because globalization is going to </v>

567
00:35:51.511 --> 00:35:54.160
<v Speaker 5>increase,</v>
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>

568
00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:59.300
<v Speaker 5>you really think you have to adapt to </v>
<v Speaker 5>this new situation and really know their</v>

569
00:36:03.151 --> 00:36:03.984
<v Speaker 5>ordination state and social state told </v>
<v Speaker 5>the people that we are going to produce </v>

570
00:36:09.601 --> 00:36:13.980
<v Speaker 5>heaven here on earth and that doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 5>turn out like that.</v>

571
00:36:14.130 --> 00:36:14.963
<v Speaker 5>And so there's resentment on that and </v>
<v Speaker 5>people have the feeling that the people </v>

572
00:36:18.861 --> 00:36:22.260
<v Speaker 5>up there,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the adult contact anymore with us,</v>

573
00:36:22.300 --> 00:36:23.133
<v Speaker 5>they're detached,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they're just looking for their own </v>

574
00:36:26.401 --> 00:36:27.234
<v Speaker 5>position,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they own money and that creates this </v>

575
00:36:30.331 --> 00:36:33.090
<v Speaker 5>kind of populism.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And uh,</v>

576
00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:34.050
<v Speaker 5>and that's,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I think,</v>

577
00:36:34.051 --> 00:36:38.600
<v Speaker 5>a danger for democracy and that worries </v>
<v Speaker 5>me.</v>

578
00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:41.310
<v Speaker 5>That's one of the reasons why I wrote my</v>
<v Speaker 5>book.</v>

579
00:36:41.400 --> 00:36:43.460
<v Speaker 5>I just want to say it's been a real </v>
<v Speaker 5>pleasure to,</v>

580
00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.383
<v Speaker 5>to ask you this.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Have you given me your thoughts and </v>

581
00:36:46.021 --> 00:36:48.390
<v Speaker 5>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's been a pleasure.</v>

582
00:36:48.690 --> 00:36:51.990

<v Speaker 1>as we often say here,</v>

585
00:37:05.001 --> 00:37:05.834
<v Speaker 1>official policy of not everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect and despite the success of </v>

586
00:37:08.931 --> 00:37:12.260
<v Speaker 1>Lichtenstein's model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are still many questions.</v>

587
00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:16.070
<v Speaker 1>Is it legitimate that the head of state </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not chosen by his citizens?</v>

588
00:37:16.071 --> 00:37:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Could this system really be implemented </v>
<v Speaker 1>in big nations?</v>
