1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>The People's Republic of China has </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed a lot since it was founded in </v>

2
00:00:03.511 --> 00:00:08.511
<v Speaker 1>1949 as a hard line socialist country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So much so that if Mao himself rose from</v>

3
00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.910
<v Speaker 1>the grave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it probably fall right back into it.</v>

4
00:00:11.911 --> 00:00:12.744
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 1970s China was a country of </v>

5
00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor farmers.</v>

6
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's a world superpower and economic</v>

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:25.593
<v Speaker 1>powerhouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No country in history has grown so fast </v>

8
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.000
<v Speaker 1>or has gotten so many people out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty as China has done in the last 40</v>

9
00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:33.834
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

10
00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Throughout this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country has grown as an average </v>

12
00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:39.094
<v Speaker 1>rate of almost 10% per year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and most importantly almost 800 million </v>

13
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:46.060
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than the entire population of Latin</v>

14
00:00:46.061 --> 00:00:48.790
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain and Portugal have escaped poverty.</v>

15
00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.610
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure this isn't news to you </v>
<v Speaker 1>or anyone else.</v>

16
00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.730
<v Speaker 1>Box.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did China manage to change?</v>

17
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:03.623
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>transformation was the result of a </v>

18
00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:06.804
<v Speaker 1>carefully drawn plan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some intricate strategy maps out spite </v>

19
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.890
<v Speaker 1>China's leaders?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.500
<v Speaker 1>you viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think that this story has a twist that</v>

21
00:01:13.501 --> 00:01:16.140
<v Speaker 1>is probably going to surprise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen up.</v>

22
00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.880
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get into the video today,</v>

23
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:18.714
<v Speaker 1>I did want to thank everyone who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been supporting us on page on in just a </v>

24
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.853
<v Speaker 1>few days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've got 650 have you on board helping </v>

25
00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:28.050
<v Speaker 1>us out in making these videos?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're right now working hardware,</v>

26
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.913
<v Speaker 1>preparing a lot of surprises and we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to have great stuff in store for </v>

27
00:01:31.561 --> 00:01:34.890
<v Speaker 1>people who are supporting us on paper.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're on consider doing it if you want.</v>

28
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:35.753
<v Speaker 1>It would be cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a link in the description below </v>

29
00:01:37.051 --> 00:01:37.884
<v Speaker 1>and let's crack on.</v>

30
00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.803
<v Speaker 1>On October the first 1949 miles a dong </v>
<v Speaker 1>proclaims the existence of the People's </v>

32
00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:52.063
<v Speaker 1>Republic of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did this from Tienanmen Square in </v>

33
00:01:54.171 --> 00:01:59.171
<v Speaker 1>Beijing and he did so with a very clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>slogan and that was China has stood up.</v>

34
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.373
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

35
00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.563
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the following three decades that </v>

36
00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:27.030
<v Speaker 1>reality had changed a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now is rather obsessed with the ideology</v>

37
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>willing to implant the societal model </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he has.</v>

38
00:02:29.971 --> 00:02:30.804
<v Speaker 1>In his mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much any cost as among </v>

39
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.074
<v Speaker 1>other things to view where he thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beijing could decide everything and </v>

40
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 1>determine the future of everything.</v>

41
00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.240
<v Speaker 2>Much</v>

42
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.580
<v Speaker 1>to produce,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what to produce,</v>

43
00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 1>how to distribute the workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how many factories were needed,</v>

44
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:49.530
<v Speaker 1>how the goods were to be distributed and</v>
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>

45
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.940
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

46
00:02:50.941 --> 00:02:52.320
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>

47
00:02:52.321 --> 00:02:53.154
<v Speaker 1>the other thing that was clear to mouth </v>
<v Speaker 1>was that any dissidents was a danger </v>

48
00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:01.790
<v Speaker 1>that hat to be eliminated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

49
00:03:03.631 --> 00:03:06.690
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these ideas in the hands of someone with</v>

50
00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:10.620
<v Speaker 1>so much power and so much stubbornness </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly had consequences.</v>

51
00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Some studies estimate that during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 30 years that mel was the supreme</v>

52
00:03:15.931 --> 00:03:16.764
<v Speaker 1>leader of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between 50 and 70 million people lost </v>

53
00:03:20.521 --> 00:03:23.490
<v Speaker 1>their lives due to famine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political persecution,</v>

54
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.320
<v Speaker 1>and absolute poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

55
00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:29.243
<v Speaker 1>And after 30 years in power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after collectivizing all of China's </v>

56
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:32.814
<v Speaker 1>lands and properties and brutally </v>
<v Speaker 1>persecuting millions and millions of </v>

57
00:03:35.311 --> 00:03:36.730
<v Speaker 1>intellectuals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>academics,</v>

58
00:03:36.731 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 1>and anyone who wasn't comfortable with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the regime,</v>

59
00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China was plunged into misery,</v>

60
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:44.640
<v Speaker 1>cultural revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wrecked,</v>

61
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.940
<v Speaker 1>devastation on the lives of millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese people.</v>

62
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:48.803
<v Speaker 1>For 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nation was reduced to a state of </v>

63
00:03:51.181 --> 00:03:52.014
<v Speaker 1>barbarism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shao Hahn and associate professor at </v>

64
00:03:54.451 --> 00:03:56.700
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Political Science and law.</v>

65
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.273
<v Speaker 1>I've found time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 80% of all Chinese people </v>

66
00:04:04.981 --> 00:04:08.040
<v Speaker 1>lived in miserable conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Famine was common.</v>

67
00:04:08.041 --> 00:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>Political terror purges where the order </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the day and the living standard swear</v>

68
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:16.890
<v Speaker 1>comparable to that of some countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>sub Saharan Africa and all of this,</v>

69
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.380
<v Speaker 1>while Japan and the Asian dragons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong,</v>

70
00:04:19.381 --> 00:04:21.450
<v Speaker 1>Taiwan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea and Singapore,</v>

71
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 1>we're taking off enormously.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why we call and be surprised that</v>

72
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:26.604
<v Speaker 1>when mel died in 1976 the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>communist party divided into three very </v>

73
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.943
<v Speaker 1>different sectors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The radicals they'd by Jen Ching now's </v>

74
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 1>own widow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how gong fangs moderate reformers,</v>

75
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:40.430
<v Speaker 1>and it's the most aggressive reformers </v>
<v Speaker 1>led by Dang Shao Ping.</v>

76
00:04:40.431 --> 00:04:41.264
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leanne's after a lot of push and pull </v>

77
00:04:45.611 --> 00:04:49.210
<v Speaker 1>and often making it clear that China </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't stay the way it was any longer.</v>

78
00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.073
<v Speaker 1>In 1978 it was the latter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most convinced reformers who took </v>

79
00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:54.124
<v Speaker 1>the lead.</v>

80
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.773
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

81
00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:07.063
<v Speaker 1>black cat and the white cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember the questions that I asked at </v>

82
00:05:11.531 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:05:12.581 --> 00:05:16.600
<v Speaker 1>let's answer the first one right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did China manage to change?</v>

84
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:17.220
<v Speaker 1>It's called</v>

85
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.053
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

86
00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:24.560
<v Speaker 1>In December of 1978 at the 11th congress</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Chinese Communist Party,</v>

87
00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:25.840
<v Speaker 1>the reformist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang she,</v>

88
00:05:25.841 --> 00:05:27.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll ping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took over the country's leadership.</v>

89
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.023
<v Speaker 1>Then Shannon Penn argued that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological utopia that had damaged </v>

90
00:05:34.121 --> 00:05:34.954
<v Speaker 1>China so much had to be set aside and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they needed to commit to </v>

91
00:05:38.171 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>modernization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

92
00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:42.370
<v Speaker 1>you might already be familiar with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>most famous phrase.</v>

93
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.700
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't matter whether the cat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>black or white,</v>

94
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:48.000
<v Speaker 1>as long as it catches mice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dung shall pain,</v>

95
00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:49.143
<v Speaker 1>and as a viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what he did for the </v>

96
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:52.810
<v Speaker 1>following 10 years because if we have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>say something,</v>

97
00:05:52.811 --> 00:05:55.750
<v Speaker 1>it's that the reforms weren't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>very quick,</v>

98
00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:57.710
<v Speaker 1>but you might now be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

99
00:05:57.711 --> 00:05:58.640
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

100
00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>but what exactly were their priorities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

101
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:02.384
<v Speaker 1>from an economic perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can classify the reforms into three </v>

102
00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:06.680
<v Speaker 1>big blocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>agriculture,</v>

103
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>industry and trade and sweat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all began in the fields.</v>

104
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:11.720
<v Speaker 1>We've already mentioned that at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

105
00:06:11.721 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>China was fundamentally a country of </v>
<v Speaker 1>peasants.</v>

106
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the agrarian reform do you collectivize </v>

107
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:26.173
<v Speaker 1>the countryside and the communes were </v>
<v Speaker 1>suppressed and replaced by the usual </v>

108
00:06:29.301 --> 00:06:33.620
<v Speaker 1>family exploitation model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

109
00:06:33.621 --> 00:06:34.454
<v Speaker 1>the so called household responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>system was implemented by which many </v>

110
00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.294
<v Speaker 1>decisions Sanchez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what type of crops to plant spot </v>

111
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:43.430
<v Speaker 1>investments to make what tools and get </v>
<v Speaker 1>and by past from the governments,</v>

112
00:06:43.431 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>from the bureaucrats to the families </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves.</v>

113
00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:46.933
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the peasants had to sell parts of their </v>

114
00:06:48.231 --> 00:06:51.250
<v Speaker 1>harvest to the state and then could sell</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest on the free market,</v>

115
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>a completely free prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that was a huge revolution.</v>

116
00:06:57.231 --> 00:06:58.064
<v Speaker 1>But this time the good kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural production soared and food </v>

117
00:07:00.561 --> 00:07:01.394
<v Speaker 1>prices dropped.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the peasants living conditions </v>

118
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:07.880
<v Speaker 1>improved a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm,</v>

119
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:08.723
<v Speaker 1>the results were good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Beijing decided to apply similar </v>

120
00:07:10.891 --> 00:07:11.724
<v Speaker 1>reforms to the industry sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way the government gradually </v>

121
00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:14.994
<v Speaker 1>transfer decision making from Beijing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ministries to government owned </v>

122
00:07:18.211 --> 00:07:19.290
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

123
00:07:19.291 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>the decisions where it's still coming </v>
<v Speaker 1>down from the government,</v>

124
00:07:21.751 --> 00:07:25.140
<v Speaker 1>but let's just say they were working </v>
<v Speaker 1>under different criteria.</v>

125
00:07:26.220 --> 00:07:26.890
<v Speaker 2>That one,</v>

126
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's all buy less.</v>

127
00:07:27.941 --> 00:07:31.390
<v Speaker 1>All throughout the 1980s governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>owned company managers were able to make</v>

128
00:07:31.391 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 1>decisions such as sharing benefits among</v>
<v Speaker 1>workers,</v>

129
00:07:34.061 --> 00:07:35.650
<v Speaker 1>paying productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bonuses,</v>

130
00:07:35.651 --> 00:07:37.840
<v Speaker 1>grounding the freedom to hire and fire </v>
<v Speaker 1>employees,</v>

131
00:07:37.841 --> 00:07:40.840
<v Speaker 1>deciding which suppliers to work with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the setting free prices.</v>

132
00:07:40.870 --> 00:07:41.703
<v Speaker 1>And the list goes on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes sense because who better than </v>

133
00:07:48.941 --> 00:07:52.720
<v Speaker 1>the companies own managers to decide </v>
<v Speaker 1>what they need to work better?</v>

134
00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:57.361
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in addition,</v>

135
00:07:57.361 --> 00:08:00.690
<v Speaker 1>this was all the companies by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalization of private companies.</v>

136
00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:02.820
<v Speaker 1>So suddenly the government owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

137
00:08:02.850 --> 00:08:03.683
<v Speaker 1>they had competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was also a trade reform in </v>

138
00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:06.384
<v Speaker 1>which little by little China allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign trade by largely dismantling </v>

139
00:08:09.481 --> 00:08:11.310
<v Speaker 1>import barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tariffs.</v>

140
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:13.110
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we owns agriculture,</v>

141
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:15.990
<v Speaker 1>the reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they did face a huge problem.</v>

142
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 1>China was a very poor country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it has been either capital</v>

143
00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:21.090
<v Speaker 1>nor technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>

144
00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the government do?</v>

145
00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:24.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gets interesting.</v>

146
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.263
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

147
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:32.413
<v Speaker 1>Special economic zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beginning of the 1980s China was a very </v>

148
00:08:37.341 --> 00:08:39.200
<v Speaker 1>poor country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was close to the world,</v>

149
00:08:39.201 --> 00:08:40.034
<v Speaker 1>and it lacks both money and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or what he did have was a large </v>

150
00:08:42.711 --> 00:08:46.250
<v Speaker 1>workforce willing to work in better </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions than the ones they had in the</v>

151
00:08:46.251 --> 00:08:51.251
<v Speaker 1>countryside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So under these circumstances,</v>

152
00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:54.173
<v Speaker 1>then she,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our pings government decided for an </v>

153
00:08:55.531 --> 00:08:57.810
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't want to completely renounced</v>

154
00:08:57.811 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the economic model of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd inherited from mouth,</v>

155
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.163
<v Speaker 1>but they did want to make something so </v>
<v Speaker 1>they made special economic zones in </v>

156
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:06.210
<v Speaker 1>areas where the communist system had </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

157
00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:08.690 --> 00:09:09.523
<v Speaker 1>In these areas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies could invest and set </v>

159
00:09:11.401 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>up factories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

160
00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they had access to the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>workforce.</v>

161
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:18.900
<v Speaker 1>That in itself was a huge advantage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that wasn't all.</v>

162
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:19.793
<v Speaker 1>They also have very few taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively this will bureaucracy and </v>

163
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:23.664
<v Speaker 1>some no terrorists.</v>

164
00:09:26.110 --> 00:09:26.943
<v Speaker 2>It was</v>

165
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:31.300
<v Speaker 1>essentially a smaller waist for </v>
<v Speaker 1>multinationals in the middle of the then</v>

166
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:34.450
<v Speaker 1>hostile and Hermetic People's Republic </v>
<v Speaker 1>of China.</v>

167
00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:37.840
<v Speaker 1>Beijing's idea was very clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bring technology,</v>

168
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.580
<v Speaker 1>bring capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring work.</v>

169
00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:42.130
<v Speaker 1>Initially for special economic zones </v>
<v Speaker 1>were set up.</v>

170
00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:42.993
<v Speaker 1>Shen Zen Zhuhai shall men and Shanto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were so successful that the </v>

171
00:09:46.541 --> 00:09:48.820
<v Speaker 1>authorities began planting them all over</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

172
00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

173
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.820
<v Speaker 1>There's the case for example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shenzhen,</v>

174
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:57.890
<v Speaker 1>when the special economic zone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>created,</v>

175
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:01.940
<v Speaker 1>the area was nothing more than a poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>fishing village with just over 30,000</v>

176
00:10:01.941 --> 00:10:02.774
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today it stands at 12 million </v>

177
00:10:04.341 --> 00:10:05.174
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's GDP will soon as the past out of </v>

178
00:10:06.801 --> 00:10:07.634
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's one of the world capitals of </v>

179
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:12.680
<v Speaker 1>technology and it's all happens in just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a few decades.</v>

180
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:17.690
<v Speaker 2>Do you know</v>

181
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Speaker 1>the company is quite away Dji or 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>cents?</v>

182
00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:21.800
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're from this city,</v>

183
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:22.693
<v Speaker 1>these economic zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Success was so great that we can state </v>

184
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:27.590
<v Speaker 1>that they were the precursors of China's</v>
<v Speaker 1>opening.</v>

185
00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:31.550
<v Speaker 1>The shenton special economic zone is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiment.</v>

186
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:34.310
<v Speaker 1>We need more time to see whether it has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gone well.</v>

187
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.530
<v Speaker 1>We wish it success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If it fails,</v>

188
00:10:36.630 --> 00:10:37.463
<v Speaker 1>it will provide some lessons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dung shopping because folks Dang shall </v>

189
00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:43.160
<v Speaker 1>pings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initial idea was to use these areas,</v>

190
00:10:43.161 --> 00:10:43.994
<v Speaker 1>not to open up the country to gain </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources so that the government could </v>

191
00:10:47.391 --> 00:10:48.224
<v Speaker 1>maintain the old model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's often thought that China's </v>

192
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:50.983
<v Speaker 1>transformation was perfectly drawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>designs and calculated by the Beijing </v>

193
00:10:54.681 --> 00:10:55.700
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

194
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.250
<v Speaker 1>and this might surprise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't like this,</v>

195
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:06.770
<v Speaker 1>the marginalist revolution,</v>

196
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:08.103
<v Speaker 3>Huh?</v>

197
00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:12.460
<v Speaker 1>For the Chinese reforms where plans by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beijing governments,</v>

198
00:11:12.580 --> 00:11:13.960
<v Speaker 1>but where are they really?</v>

199
00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:16.800
<v Speaker 3>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

200
00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.800
<v Speaker 1>you see often Mao's death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China with a wreck.</v>

201
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:22.290
<v Speaker 1>The last crusade of these so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>great helmsmen.</v>

202
00:11:22.291 --> 00:11:25.740
<v Speaker 1>The Cultural Revolution had left the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in tatters.</v>

203
00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.593
<v Speaker 1>Mao's cultural revolution producer </v>
<v Speaker 1>results opposite to what he presumably </v>

204
00:11:30.481 --> 00:11:34.500
<v Speaker 1>intended leading many Chinese solutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>faith in their government altogether.</v>

205
00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:35.543
<v Speaker 1>Frank Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch historian who specializes in </v>

206
00:11:37.711 --> 00:11:38.970
<v Speaker 1>modern China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

207
00:11:38.971 --> 00:11:42.120
<v Speaker 1>it was during this period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black markets began to spread places</v>

208
00:11:42.121 --> 00:11:44.580
<v Speaker 1>where people try to survive outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>

209
00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:48.120
<v Speaker 1>And that also meant a very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural change.</v>

210
00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:51.750
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps that's why often Mao's death </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the transitions chaos,</v>

211
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:54.160
<v Speaker 1>some changes began to happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>automatically.</v>

212
00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.463
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the government continued to </v>

213
00:11:57.461 --> 00:11:58.294
<v Speaker 1>promote collectivized agriculture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some regions revolted and decided to </v>

214
00:12:01.301 --> 00:12:02.134
<v Speaker 1>implement this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the family exploitation system on their </v>

215
00:12:03.941 --> 00:12:04.774
<v Speaker 1>own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though this manager breaking the </v>

216
00:12:05.771 --> 00:12:10.000
<v Speaker 1>law and returning de facto to a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploitation systems.</v>

217
00:12:11.560 --> 00:12:12.393
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as this initiative started gaining more </v>

218
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:14.734
<v Speaker 1>and more followers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beijing government finally decided </v>

219
00:12:16.451 --> 00:12:18.160
<v Speaker 1>to establish these changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

220
00:12:18.161 --> 00:12:18.994
<v Speaker 1>state policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was actually following these </v>

221
00:12:20.921 --> 00:12:23.230
<v Speaker 1>changes that caused the change in </v>
<v Speaker 1>society.</v>

222
00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.123
<v Speaker 1>Something similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens with private businesses in </v>

223
00:12:25.811 --> 00:12:26.644
<v Speaker 1>the cities you see often Mao's death.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many young people had been sent to the </v>

224
00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.960
<v Speaker 1>countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 1>returned to the cities,</v>

225
00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>and since there was no work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tried to sort it out themselves and</v>

226
00:12:38.621 --> 00:12:39.454
<v Speaker 1>the government is simply had to accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and suddenly private stores be under </v>

227
00:12:42.170 --> 00:12:43.003
<v Speaker 1>multiplied like mushrooms in every </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese city ending the state's </v>

228
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:48.620
<v Speaker 1>commercial monopoly once and for all.</v>

229
00:12:51.890 --> 00:12:52.723
<v Speaker 1>And in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing happens with the </v>

230
00:12:53.781 --> 00:12:54.614
<v Speaker 1>municipal and regional companies which </v>
<v Speaker 1>began to emerge outside of state </v>

231
00:12:57.381 --> 00:12:58.214
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This led them to be the most dynamic in </v>

232
00:13:00.441 --> 00:13:02.390
<v Speaker 1>China for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

233
00:13:02.391 --> 00:13:03.224
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dang shopping's government didn't stop </v>

234
00:13:04.851 --> 00:13:05.790
<v Speaker 1>these changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it?</v>

235
00:13:05.810 --> 00:13:06.643
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he ended up implementing them as </v>

236
00:13:08.121 --> 00:13:09.470
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you can see,</v>

237
00:13:09.471 --> 00:13:12.800
<v Speaker 1>a large part of the change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far more than what we're often told,</v>

238
00:13:12.950 --> 00:13:15.530
<v Speaker 1>came from the bottom up and not the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>

239
00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.393

<v Speaker 1>we do know that Sean Penn was no saint,</v>

243
00:13:25.431 --> 00:13:27.980
<v Speaker 1>he was a dictator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And without going much further,</v>

244
00:13:27.981 --> 00:13:31.030
<v Speaker 1>we can see that the tnm and repression </v>
<v Speaker 1>was his own</v>

245
00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:31.953
<v Speaker 2>doing,</v>

246
00:13:33.690 --> 00:13:34.523
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think China will ends up ever </v>
