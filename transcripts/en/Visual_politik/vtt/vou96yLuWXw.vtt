<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.280
<v Speaker 2>one of the most surprising things about </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.750
<v Speaker 2>and there are many surprising things is </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite how safe it is.</v>

4
00:00:14.751 --> 00:00:15.584
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Japan is one of the few </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the world where you can </v>

5
00:00:17.611 --> 00:00:21.090
<v Speaker 2>leave an iphone 10 and a coffee shop and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only thing you've got to worry about</v>

6
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.953
<v Speaker 2>is dropping by the next day to get it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because to view it is only certain that </v>

7
00:00:25.111 --> 00:00:25.944
<v Speaker 2>your recently released brand new iphone </v>
<v Speaker 2>10 will be there waiting for you at the </v>

8
00:00:29.031 --> 00:00:29.300
<v Speaker 2>next</v>

9
00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.133
<v Speaker 1>stay.</v>

10
00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.630
<v Speaker 2>I'm not even exaggerating here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>

11
00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:36.464
<v Speaker 2>Japan is a beautiful country with </v>
<v Speaker 2>amazing sites where everything seems to </v>

12
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:44.681
<v Speaker 2>be exactly where it should be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

13
00:00:49.811 --> 00:00:54.000
<v Speaker 2>this is not a travel channel in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>video is indeed not sponsored by Japan's</v>

14
00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:57.330
<v Speaker 2>Ministry of Tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So let us get right to the point yet.</v>

15
00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Recently we will find out that emperor </v>
<v Speaker 2>hito has decided to abdicate.</v>

16
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 2>The Emperor of Japan will step down on </v>
<v Speaker 2>April 30th,</v>

17
00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.180
<v Speaker 2>2019 the first application by a Japanese</v>
<v Speaker 2>monarch in two centuries.</v>

18
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.871
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see,</v>

19
00:01:13.871 --> 00:01:18.871
<v Speaker 2>this emperor came to the throne almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>30 years ago in 1989 just when the great</v>

20
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.430
<v Speaker 2>Japanese crisis again.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So No.</v>

21
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.130
<v Speaker 2>In Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the emperor has no power.</v>

22
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:27.220
<v Speaker 2>So I can hito wasn't responsible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't say that.</v>

23
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:28.054
<v Speaker 2>Can't be just coincidence and bad luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can practically say that it was off </v>

24
00:01:31.421 --> 00:01:34.960
<v Speaker 2>to Iquitos arrival that 30 years of </v>
<v Speaker 2>stagnation began,</v>

25
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.550
<v Speaker 2>and in this video we're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens,</v>

26
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:40.510
<v Speaker 2>what caused this great crisis and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>the German economic model has managed to</v>

27
00:01:40.511 --> 00:01:42.430
<v Speaker 2>defeat the Japanese model.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But first,</v>

28
00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:44.530
<v Speaker 2>have you or let's have a small history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lesson.</v>

29
00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.213
<v Speaker 2>Goals exists and Germany are two very </v>
<v Speaker 2>interesting countries with a lot in </v>

30
00:01:57.801 --> 00:01:58.634
<v Speaker 2>common,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's also many differences off to </v>

31
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:03.380
<v Speaker 2>the Second World War.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both countries were literally in ruins.</v>

32
00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 2>They had lost not only the </v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>

33
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 2>but also an entire generation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

34
00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:09.943
<v Speaker 2>despite this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>between the 1950s in the 1970s both </v>

35
00:02:12.111 --> 00:02:12.944
<v Speaker 2>countries experienced such a powerful </v>
<v Speaker 2>take off that in those two decades they </v>

36
00:02:16.281 --> 00:02:17.114
<v Speaker 2>not only managed to recover bus become </v>
<v Speaker 2>two of the largest economies in the </v>

37
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:23.180
<v Speaker 2>world as well as two of the richest </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

38
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though it might seem incredible,</v>

39
00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:28.004
<v Speaker 2>it's a day for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was speculated that Japan could </v>

40
00:02:29.781 --> 00:02:34.280
<v Speaker 2>surpass even the United States as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's largest economy and oh,</v>

41
00:02:34.281 --> 00:02:35.114
<v Speaker 2>how things have changed says that </v>
<v Speaker 2>between 1955 and 1973 Japan grew at an </v>

42
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.260
<v Speaker 2>average rate of 9% a year and between </v>
<v Speaker 2>1973 and 1990 above 4% these are really,</v>

43
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.443
<v Speaker 2>truly incredible rates and Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't stay behind just as an average </v>

44
00:02:52.941 --> 00:02:55.580
<v Speaker 2>growth rate of 7% for almost 30 years.</v>

45
00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:58.100
<v Speaker 1>Countries</v>

46
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.790
<v Speaker 2>where at full throttle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their factories works tirelessly.</v>

47
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:01.624
<v Speaker 2>There was no unemployment and it's both </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germans and the Japanese saved and </v>

48
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:05.674
<v Speaker 2>invested their money all over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Suddenly Japanese and German companies </v>

49
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:14.101
<v Speaker 2>became famous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>World was very important,</v>

50
00:03:17.251 --> 00:03:18.084
<v Speaker 2>especially for Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a country that lives constantly under </v>

51
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.393
<v Speaker 2>nature's threat.</v>

52
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.070
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

53
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:23.903
<v Speaker 2>it's being a very mountainous country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan suffers from all kinds of natural </v>

54
00:03:26.791 --> 00:03:27.900
<v Speaker 2>disasters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>earthquakes,</v>

55
00:03:27.901 --> 00:03:29.500
<v Speaker 2>cyclin tsunamis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>

56
00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.590
<v Speaker 2>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>

57
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:32.663
<v Speaker 1>Bye Bye.</v>

58
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.430
<v Speaker 2>In a future visual politic video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hit subscribe.</v>

59
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:36.264
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>going to tell you all about how these </v>

60
00:03:37.141 --> 00:03:42.141
<v Speaker 2>two economic miracles took place.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

61
00:03:44.271 --> 00:03:48.410
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that in 1989 this entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>economic takeoff stops.</v>

62
00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:49.303
<v Speaker 2>It came to an end and gave way to what </v>
<v Speaker 2>is known as the great Japanese </v>

63
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.350
<v Speaker 2>stagnation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Forget Greece.</v>

64
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.370
<v Speaker 2>Japan has the world's real economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>

65
00:03:56.371 --> 00:03:58.790
<v Speaker 2>Buck Christopher Matthews,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an axios reporter.</v>

66
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.743
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty convinced this isn't news to </v>
<v Speaker 2>you as it isn't strange to hear people </v>

67
00:04:02.631 --> 00:04:05.180
<v Speaker 2>talk about Japan along with the word </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis.</v>

68
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.633
<v Speaker 2>Since I can recall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan has been the country of eternal </v>

69
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:11.124
<v Speaker 2>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country that has one good year for </v>

70
00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:14.660
<v Speaker 2>every three bad ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

71
00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:15.503
<v Speaker 2>nowadays we can easily declared Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>v winner in the growth rates that both </v>

72
00:04:18.751 --> 00:04:23.751
<v Speaker 2>countries maintained for decades today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

73
00:04:26.521 --> 00:04:29.220
<v Speaker 2>which has also gone through some bad </v>
<v Speaker 2>times in recent decades,</v>

74
00:04:29.221 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 2>is richer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has healthier public accounts,</v>

75
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>is more competitive internationally and </v>
<v Speaker 2>has higher weight.</v>

76
00:04:33.761 --> 00:04:34.594
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:35.723
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

78
00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:36.573
<v Speaker 2>No idea of Japan situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I think we can use to very revealing </v>

79
00:04:39.281 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 2>facts first in Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>real wages,</v>

80
00:04:41.411 --> 00:04:44.620
<v Speaker 2>which take into account inflation are </v>
<v Speaker 2>lower today than salaries.</v>

81
00:04:44.621 --> 00:04:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Back in 1990 which was 30 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>seconds,</v>

82
00:04:48.341 --> 00:04:51.550
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese government's public debt is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the highest in the world.</v>

83
00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.580
<v Speaker 2>250% of GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

84
00:04:54.581 --> 00:04:56.830
<v Speaker 2>we didn't screw that up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is really the debt.</v>

85
00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.690
<v Speaker 2>So do you feel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering,</v>

86
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:03.533
<v Speaker 2>well what the hell happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What made the German models so much </v>

87
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:07.620
<v Speaker 2>better than the Japanese?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

88
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.940
<v Speaker 2>obviously there are lots of reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we believe that three of them are by</v>

89
00:05:11.941 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 2>far the most important.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we're going to take a look at them,</v>

90
00:05:14.401 --> 00:05:14.610
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

91
00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:15.443
<v Speaker 1>No</v>

92
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.840
<v Speaker 2>problematic model.</v>

93
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:24.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

94
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:27.620
<v Speaker 2>First we can save that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a big difference between Japan</v>

95
00:05:27.621 --> 00:05:28.454
<v Speaker 2>and Japanese developments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country of the rising sun opposite </v>

96
00:05:30.561 --> 00:05:33.710
<v Speaker 2>to protect a large industrial </v>
<v Speaker 2>conglomerates of [inaudible].</v>

97
00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:35.300
<v Speaker 2>They can read,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so to speak,</v>

98
00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:37.520
<v Speaker 2>holdings the do practically everything </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is,</v>

99
00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.650
<v Speaker 2>they have companies for all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

100
00:05:39.651 --> 00:05:41.300
<v Speaker 2>cause planes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tires,</v>

101
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:42.193
<v Speaker 2>even toothpaste.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is manufactured by the same </v>

102
00:05:46.851 --> 00:05:47.684
<v Speaker 2>holding company whose companies support </v>
<v Speaker 2>each other by and sell products between </v>

103
00:05:50.361 --> 00:05:54.080
<v Speaker 2>themselves and even have their own banks</v>
<v Speaker 2>to finance themselves.</v>

104
00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 2>So what's the problem this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

105
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>these large conglomerates tended to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>very bureaucratic and not very flexible.</v>

106
00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:04.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

107
00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.110
<v Speaker 2>So decision making was a very difficult </v>
<v Speaker 2>and slow process,</v>

108
00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:07.973
<v Speaker 2>but the Japanese government decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>compensate them for all of these </v>

109
00:06:10.051 --> 00:06:10.884
<v Speaker 2>disadvantages and to didn't hesitate to </v>
<v Speaker 2>give the Keiretsu all kinds of </v>

110
00:06:13.741 --> 00:06:15.830
<v Speaker 2>advantages and privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

111
00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.673
<v Speaker 2>Japan central bank finance them </v>
<v Speaker 2>generously at abnormally low rates </v>

112
00:06:19.621 --> 00:06:21.690
<v Speaker 2>through specific programs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

113
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 2>the results,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were not</v>

114
00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.973
<v Speaker 1>good.</v>

115
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:29.050
<v Speaker 2>See these large groups became very </v>
<v Speaker 2>influential in the country's politics.</v>

116
00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:29.913
<v Speaker 2>They also had many problems because of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course when one of these conglomerates </v>

117
00:06:32.201 --> 00:06:35.340
<v Speaker 2>companies did badly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was extremely easy for them to infect</v>

118
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.480
<v Speaker 2>the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were also in a lot of debt and they</v>

119
00:06:37.481 --> 00:06:38.320
<v Speaker 2>even limited common</v>

120
00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:39.293
<v Speaker 1>tissue.</v>

121
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.540
<v Speaker 2>I mean how can one compete with such </v>
<v Speaker 2>groups if they are also protected by the</v>

122
00:06:43.541 --> 00:06:45.940
<v Speaker 2>government and to have all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileges.</v>

123
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.220
<v Speaker 2>It's a pretty hard thing to ask.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hands.</v>

124
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:49.054
<v Speaker 2>In Germany the political commitments was</v>
<v Speaker 2>completely different and focused on </v>

125
00:06:51.701 --> 00:06:55.450
<v Speaker 2>creating a very competitive market with </v>
<v Speaker 2>small and medium sized company,</v>

126
00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.320
<v Speaker 2>all that large industrial ribs in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

127
00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:07.470
<v Speaker 2>Well of course there are and that's a </v>
<v Speaker 2>good thing as long as they don't,</v>

128
00:07:07.471 --> 00:07:11.550
<v Speaker 2>depends on the government or receive </v>
<v Speaker 2>privileges that impede competition.</v>

129
00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:15.330
<v Speaker 2>So while Germany's companies thrive to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan's and large conglomerates have had</v>

130
00:07:15.331 --> 00:07:19.110
<v Speaker 2>many problems and most of disappeared or</v>
<v Speaker 2>broken down at some point,</v>

131
00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:24.140
<v Speaker 2>but that's not all discount policy</v>

132
00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:33.190
<v Speaker 2>is Japanese politicians thought that in </v>
<v Speaker 2>order to export more,</v>

133
00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.790
<v Speaker 2>devaluing the currency from time to time</v>
<v Speaker 2>was not a bad thing.</v>

134
00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.250
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1985 the real problems began.</v>

135
00:07:40.220 --> 00:07:43.180
<v Speaker 2>See as a result of all these currency </v>
<v Speaker 2>wars,</v>

136
00:07:43.181 --> 00:07:47.410
<v Speaker 2>the United States gained a fairly large </v>
<v Speaker 2>external deficits and because Washington</v>

137
00:07:47.411 --> 00:07:50.410
<v Speaker 2>politicians of the time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as they do now didn't like it,</v>

138
00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:51.333
<v Speaker 2>they forced the so called plaza record </v>
<v Speaker 2>and agreements between the United </v>

139
00:07:54.700 --> 00:07:55.061
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

140
00:07:55.061 --> 00:07:55.721
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>

141
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:59.710
<v Speaker 2>and the United Kingdom to depreciate the</v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar to decrease the trade deficits.</v>

142
00:08:00.850 --> 00:08:01.683
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a huge blow to the Japanese </v>

143
00:08:03.551 --> 00:08:04.384
<v Speaker 2>industry who was used to competing with </v>
<v Speaker 2>a little bit of help and then the </v>

144
00:08:07.091 --> 00:08:10.790
<v Speaker 2>government is sank its interest rates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and began boosting credit like there was</v>

145
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:11.920
<v Speaker 2>no tomorrow</v>

146
00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:20.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

147
00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:24.820
<v Speaker 2>the result of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that was a huge debt spiral.</v>

148
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:25.683
<v Speaker 2>Banks distributing money like crazy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>a massive bubble in the real estate and </v>

149
00:08:29.741 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 2>financial markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you know what happened next?</v>

150
00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Well in 1990 this entire house of cards </v>
<v Speaker 2>began to collapse in Germany.</v>

151
00:08:40.131 --> 00:08:43.100
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we also saw here at visual politics,</v>

152
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 2>but governments opposite to maintain a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strong mark that currency at the time,</v>

153
00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 2>which on one hand forced companies to </v>
<v Speaker 2>compete in productivity and innovation,</v>

154
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:51.853
<v Speaker 2>but on the other allowed them to buy </v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign technology and machines under </v>

155
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 2>better terms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But dear viewer,</v>

156
00:08:57.001 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 2>there is still a third ends determinant.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Different</v>

157
00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 1>walked</v>

158
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:07.190
<v Speaker 2>within themselves.</v>

159
00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:10.160
<v Speaker 1>Japan</v>

160
00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.410
<v Speaker 2>is the most elderly country in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>

161
00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.273
<v Speaker 2>just over 25% of its population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is everyone in for Japanese people </v>

162
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:19.700
<v Speaker 2>are over 65 and for every hour that </v>
<v Speaker 2>passes,</v>

163
00:09:19.730 --> 00:09:22.340
<v Speaker 2>the country's population drops by 50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

164
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.443
<v Speaker 2>The Japanese government expects the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country's population to fall below 100 </v>

165
00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:29.643
<v Speaker 2>million people by the year 2050 and of </v>
<v Speaker 2>course the more elderly citizens there </v>

166
00:09:32.591 --> 00:09:33.424
<v Speaker 2>are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the less young people there are in the </v>

167
00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:35.230
<v Speaker 2>liver,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the population.</v>

168
00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.093
<v Speaker 2>This has clear consequences for one more</v>
<v Speaker 2>public spending on pensions and </v>

169
00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:41.530
<v Speaker 2>healthcare and for another less</v>

170
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:42.503
<v Speaker 1>labor.</v>

171
00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.913
<v Speaker 2>Many other countries have this problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Japan's case is by far the most </v>

172
00:09:48.251 --> 00:09:51.340
<v Speaker 2>serious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this isn't by chance at all.</v>

173
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:57.100
<v Speaker 2>Japanese companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I've compensated for all of the problems</v>

174
00:09:57.101 --> 00:10:00.190
<v Speaker 2>caused by the bad policies that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>talked about in this video.</v>

175
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:01.063
<v Speaker 2>They forced their employees to work </v>
<v Speaker 2>longer hours than in other developed </v>

176
00:10:03.161 --> 00:10:03.994
<v Speaker 2>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which obviously it leaves very little </v>

177
00:10:05.261 --> 00:10:07.810
<v Speaker 2>time to think about starting a family </v>
<v Speaker 2>and what's more,</v>

178
00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:08.673
<v Speaker 2>what some countries like Germany have </v>
<v Speaker 2>favored the arrival of immigrants who </v>

179
00:10:11.561 --> 00:10:13.720
<v Speaker 2>tend to have higher population growth </v>
<v Speaker 2>rates.</v>

180
00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.670
<v Speaker 2>Japan has closed its doors.</v>

181
00:10:18.570 --> 00:10:19.403
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when international organizations tell </v>

182
00:10:20.881 --> 00:10:23.910
<v Speaker 2>Japan that they have to open their </v>
<v Speaker 2>borders to immigration to face the aging</v>

183
00:10:23.911 --> 00:10:24.744
<v Speaker 2>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Japanese government's has even said </v>

184
00:10:26.641 --> 00:10:27.474
<v Speaker 2>this in Japan's finance minister tells </v>
<v Speaker 2>elderly they should hurry up and die to </v>

185
00:10:31.651 --> 00:10:33.630
<v Speaker 2>help reduce countries rising welfare </v>
<v Speaker 2>bill,</v>

186
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.583
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the fundamental causes that </v>

187
00:10:35.761 --> 00:10:36.594
<v Speaker 2>have led Japan to live in continuous </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis and the courses that have made </v>

188
00:10:39.301 --> 00:10:41.950
<v Speaker 2>the German model clearly better than the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Japanese one.</v>

189
00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:42.803
<v Speaker 2>So now over to you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you think that Japan will be able to </v>

190
00:10:44.371 --> 00:10:47.940
<v Speaker 2>overcome this period of stagnation and </v>
<v Speaker 2>seemingly permanent crisis?</v>
