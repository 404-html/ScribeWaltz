1
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.800
<v Speaker 1>We had the Roman Empire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish and the British empire.</v>

2
00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Now we live in the age of the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>mm.</v>

3
00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.383
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country has had such a military </v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:15.064
<v Speaker 1>presence in so many places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in remote places like Guam in the </v>

5
00:00:17.921 --> 00:00:18.754
<v Speaker 1>middle of the Pacific,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has a military base and that's </v>

6
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.850
<v Speaker 1>actually pretty useful</v>

7
00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.690
<v Speaker 1>that you can buy a mobile phone made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea with just one click.</v>

8
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.813
<v Speaker 1>That's the outcome of global capitalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also global capitalism would not be </v>

9
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:37.970
<v Speaker 1>possible if trade wasn't safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those American bases there,</v>

10
00:00:37.971 --> 00:00:41.630
<v Speaker 1>there to protect those ships that move </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods from one place to another,</v>

11
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.980
<v Speaker 1>and this is really the reason why the US</v>
<v Speaker 1>invest so much in having a strong army,</v>

12
00:00:45.981 --> 00:00:49.280
<v Speaker 1>which has kind of been unchallenged </v>
<v Speaker 1>until now.</v>

13
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.163
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering or you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might not be who is challenging this </v>

14
00:00:52.641 --> 00:00:55.920
<v Speaker 1>empire because of course it's shine up </v>
<v Speaker 1>and swell.</v>

15
00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 1>How is trying to doing this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're going to see in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

17
00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.490
<v Speaker 1>This is the million dollar question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does America have such a big army?</v>

18
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.830
<v Speaker 1>You might argue that it doesn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>need one.</v>

19
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.753
<v Speaker 1>In fact that just by looking at a map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that America has a big </v>

20
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.623
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's secured by two fairly sizable </v>

21
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:23.060
<v Speaker 1>oceans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making it almost impossible to attack or</v>

22
00:01:23.061 --> 00:01:28.061
<v Speaker 1>invade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

23
00:01:29.111 --> 00:01:31.840
<v Speaker 1>America has the biggest army on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

24
00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:32.943
<v Speaker 1>It has more than a million active </v>
<v Speaker 1>military personnel and almost 800 </v>

25
00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.400
<v Speaker 1>military bases located in 70 different </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

26
00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.680
<v Speaker 1>Territories all over the globe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>risen,</v>

27
00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.520
<v Speaker 1>France and Russia by contrast have about</v>
<v Speaker 1>34 and bases combined.</v>

28
00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.763
<v Speaker 1>Just have a look at this map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is all over the place and there </v>

29
00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.700
<v Speaker 1>is no country that can challenge them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.050
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second because maybe there is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

31
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:01.920
<v Speaker 1>you have us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're talking all about Schneider.</v>

32
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.710
<v Speaker 1>Errol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visitable.</v>

33
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.610
<v Speaker 1>I think we've talked to thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>times about China's economic progress.</v>

34
00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 1>It's the world's factory and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies are starting to become</v>

35
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>big competition for the technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>bandits,</v>

36
00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.810
<v Speaker 1>but now we're talking about then </v>
<v Speaker 1>military more specifically than military</v>

37
00:02:16.811 --> 00:02:19.900
<v Speaker 1>presence in the south China Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>

38
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:20.734
<v Speaker 1>this is no</v>

39
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.593
<v Speaker 2>joke.</v>

40
00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.240
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south China Sea play the end of peaceful</v>

41
00:02:29.241 --> 00:02:30.074
<v Speaker 1>rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The definition string of pearls was </v>

42
00:02:31.821 --> 00:02:32.654
<v Speaker 1>first used in 2005 in an international </v>
<v Speaker 1>report given by the Department of </v>

43
00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.270
<v Speaker 1>Defense of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this report,</v>

44
00:02:38.271 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>it was predicted that China will try to </v>
<v Speaker 1>expand its naval presence throughout the</v>

45
00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Indian Ocean region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this context,</v>

46
00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.953
<v Speaker 1>the polls are a metaphor for each of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>military bases that China wants to </v>

47
00:02:47.811 --> 00:02:48.644
<v Speaker 1>build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>making a string that goes all the way </v>

48
00:02:50.451 --> 00:02:51.284
<v Speaker 1>down to Africa and the Middle East where</v>
<v Speaker 1>China imports most of its natural </v>

49
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:58.190
<v Speaker 1>resources and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these military extensions,</v>

50
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.150
<v Speaker 1>they scanned the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially America,</v>

51
00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>and they got even more scary when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>former trainees,</v>

52
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.730
<v Speaker 1>President Hu Jintao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sent this in 2009</v>

53
00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:09.950
<v Speaker 2>the road.</v>

54
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.793
<v Speaker 3>The peaceful development is a strategic </v>
<v Speaker 3>choice made by the Chinese government </v>

55
00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:17.850
<v Speaker 3>and people in the line of the nations </v>
<v Speaker 3>peace loving traditional culture.</v>

56
00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:18.713
<v Speaker 3>The trend of our times and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>fundamental interests of China who </v>

57
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:22.560
<v Speaker 3>gentle.</v>

58
00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.670
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for some reason,</v>

59
00:03:23.671 --> 00:03:24.504
<v Speaker 1>this quote that was intended to chill </v>
<v Speaker 1>out via Americans basically had the </v>

60
00:03:26.971 --> 00:03:27.804
<v Speaker 1>opposite effect because it pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounded like China was saying the </v>

61
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.900
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what is actually the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But okay,</v>

62
00:03:33.901 --> 00:03:35.160
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're probably thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>

63
00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.270
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what?</v>

64
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.900
<v Speaker 1>What was the problem with China trying </v>
<v Speaker 1>to increase their military after all,</v>

65
00:03:39.901 --> 00:03:40.734
<v Speaker 1>it's just another country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everyone has an army and wants to be </v>

66
00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 1>safe rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

67
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.310
<v Speaker 1>why should we care about China having </v>
<v Speaker 1>military basis?</v>

68
00:03:47.311 --> 00:03:50.190
<v Speaker 1>Do they really want to surpass the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States?</v>

69
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.720
<v Speaker 1>Can they even?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

70
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:53.490
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

71
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:55.650
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we always do,</v>

72
00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.830
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>lessons from the pain.</v>

73
00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.880
<v Speaker 1>We said America is almost impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>invade.</v>

74
00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Whilst there was an exception,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was in the year 1941,</v>

75
00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.970
<v Speaker 1>when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hawaii,</v>

76
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.343
<v Speaker 1>a year later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese invaded the Aleutian </v>

77
00:04:17.491 --> 00:04:21.330
<v Speaker 1>islands in Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the moment when America learned</v>

78
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.150
<v Speaker 1>an important lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody is 100 percent safe.</v>

79
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.043
<v Speaker 1>It was also the time that they figured </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should probably care about </v>

80
00:04:26.551 --> 00:04:28.110
<v Speaker 1>protecting the oceans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

81
00:04:28.111 --> 00:04:28.944
<v Speaker 1>during World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US had to fight among lots of small </v>

82
00:04:30.781 --> 00:04:31.614
<v Speaker 1>islands in the Pacific.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the case during the battle of </v>

83
00:04:33.361 --> 00:04:34.194
<v Speaker 1>midway after the attack on Pearl Harbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese trying to eliminate the US </v>

84
00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:41.730
<v Speaker 1>as a strategic power in the Pacific and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they hope to succeed by demoralizing the</v>

85
00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>American forces with another surprise </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack,</v>

86
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.993
<v Speaker 1>American cryptographers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They managed to decipher the date and </v>

87
00:04:47.011 --> 00:04:50.700
<v Speaker 1>the location of Japan's attack and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prepared a surprise counterattack.</v>

88
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:51.623
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US inflicted irreparable damage to </v>

89
00:04:54.001 --> 00:04:55.980
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese fleet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War Two ended.</v>

90
00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.590
<v Speaker 1>The Americans won and they remembered </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lesson.</v>

91
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.860
<v Speaker 1>We can't let this happen again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

92
00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.130
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did they do?</v>

93
00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:08.023
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they covered the Pacific Ocean with </v>

94
00:05:09.411 --> 00:05:10.244
<v Speaker 1>military basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically they kept soldiers on those </v>

95
00:05:12.351 --> 00:05:16.040
<v Speaker 1>small islands where they had fought and </v>
<v Speaker 1>how you might be wondering,</v>

96
00:05:16.041 --> 00:05:16.874
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is it so important to have soldiers </v>

97
00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:20.570
<v Speaker 1>on a small island?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one really cares about.</v>

98
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:21.463
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really that bad if someone wants </v>

99
00:05:22.731 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>to invade an asshole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like midway,</v>

100
00:05:24.441 --> 00:05:25.274
<v Speaker 1>I mean really and also moving soldiers </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the other side of the planet and </v>

101
00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 1>keeping them that it's not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheap.</v>

102
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:37.140
<v Speaker 3>Worship is basically a floating city </v>
<v Speaker 3>with big guns on it.</v>

103
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.380
<v Speaker 3>It's a city that can move travel 500 to </v>
<v Speaker 3>a thousand kilometers in one day,</v>

104
00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 3>so moving one of those from Los Angeles </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Shanghai will take more than 10 days,</v>

105
00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but if</v>

106
00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:52.540
<v Speaker 3>you already have ships in soldiers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Guam,</v>

107
00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.840
<v Speaker 3>you can be to Shanghai in almost three </v>
<v Speaker 3>days.</v>

108
00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 3>This is designed to deter potential </v>
<v Speaker 3>conflicts.</v>

109
00:05:58.940 --> 00:05:59.773
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of those ships would never have to </v>

110
00:06:01.731 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>fire a single weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Being so powerful.</v>

111
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.234
<v Speaker 1>Bonnets name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one would probably dare to attack </v>

112
00:06:06.291 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

113
00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>many of these ships are not meant to </v>
<v Speaker 1>combat other armies,</v>

114
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but rather than into combat pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

115
00:06:13.101 --> 00:06:13.934
<v Speaker 1>the USS Independence is a warship </v>
<v Speaker 1>created for the main purpose of </v>

116
00:06:16.791 --> 00:06:20.090
<v Speaker 1>combating piracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one of many ships,</v>

117
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.390
<v Speaker 1>in fact to the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>S naval forces getting bigger and bigger</v>

118
00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:24.283
<v Speaker 1>all the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this means that so far no one has </v>

119
00:06:26.391 --> 00:06:31.391
<v Speaker 1>been able to match it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe to add 46 ships in five years,</v>

120
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:39.370
<v Speaker 1>but 355 ships won't come for a long </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

121
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:40.353
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gives America a huge amount of </v>

122
00:06:41.681 --> 00:06:43.870
<v Speaker 1>power and this can be worrying to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

123
00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:48.250
<v Speaker 1>but so far it's created a safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment where everybody can trade on</v>

124
00:06:48.251 --> 00:06:51.010
<v Speaker 1>troubles whenever it some country or </v>
<v Speaker 1>some pirates,</v>

125
00:06:51.011 --> 00:06:51.844
<v Speaker 1>once a block of trade routes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to face all those American </v>

126
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:55.324
<v Speaker 1>ships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one reason why Southeast Asian </v>

127
00:06:56.861 --> 00:06:59.200
<v Speaker 1>nations have become exporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerhouses,</v>

128
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:01.510
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's benefited China.</v>

129
00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:02.463
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

130
00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:08.003
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that there are many </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that would happily block </v>

131
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:11.460
<v Speaker 1>China's trade routes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's China.</v>

132
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.323
<v Speaker 1>Comfortable in this position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it like depending so much on </v>

133
00:07:15.271 --> 00:07:16.530
<v Speaker 1>America's army?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:21.920
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Hedge Lamont,</v>

135
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.733
<v Speaker 1>so what defines a territory or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory is an area of land onto the </v>

136
00:07:27.101 --> 00:07:31.600
<v Speaker 1>jurisdiction of a ruler or a states.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all territories are born equal.</v>

137
00:07:31.601 --> 00:07:34.960
<v Speaker 1>Some have abundant natural resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>like Jen's gas and oil,</v>

138
00:07:34.961 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 1>while others basically having no </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

139
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.510
<v Speaker 1>the availability of some resources gives</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country they belong to.</v>

140
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.344
<v Speaker 1>Some pretty big advantages in trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most obvious example of this is oil and </v>

141
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:48.250
<v Speaker 1>how much she's trade as defined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

142
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.093
<v Speaker 2>it's a common.</v>

143
00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:56.530
<v Speaker 1>What about the others?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who have lists a few resources,</v>

144
00:07:56.590 --> 00:07:59.020
<v Speaker 1>they need to import everything for their</v>
<v Speaker 1>industries.</v>

145
00:07:59.110 --> 00:07:59.943
<v Speaker 1>They must compete with international </v>
<v Speaker 1>bitters to secure stable suppliers of </v>

146
00:08:02.951 --> 00:08:03.784
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which basically means their industrial </v>

147
00:08:05.531 --> 00:08:08.770
<v Speaker 1>cost of production is also going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>higher and this,</v>

148
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.500
<v Speaker 1>this steer view is essentially China's </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

149
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's got a lot of industry but almost</v>

150
00:08:13.751 --> 00:08:15.370
<v Speaker 1>no resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>

151
00:08:15.371 --> 00:08:16.540
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uranium,</v>

152
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.210
<v Speaker 1>most of the things that needs to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>those mobile phones,</v>

153
00:08:19.211 --> 00:08:22.000
<v Speaker 1>cars or tvs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got to come from other parts of the</v>

154
00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:26.380
<v Speaker 1>weld and this appetite for raw materials</v>
<v Speaker 1>is increasing every single day,</v>

155
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.910
<v Speaker 1>but this still isn't the end of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

156
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:28.773
<v Speaker 1>Once those resources are required,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China needs to transport them to its </v>

157
00:08:31.331 --> 00:08:34.450
<v Speaker 1>territory safely and for as little money</v>
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

158
00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.343
<v Speaker 1>The South China Sea is the busiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>collection of shipping lanes in the </v>

159
00:08:37.961 --> 00:08:41.140
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the lifeblood of East Asia carrying</v>

160
00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.033
<v Speaker 1>most of it straight in oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's obvious then that China would very </v>

161
00:08:44.591 --> 00:08:49.360
<v Speaker 1>much like to keep these lines of trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>open and preferably to control them.</v>

162
00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:58.380
<v Speaker 1>It also doesn't have a big consumer </v>
<v Speaker 1>market like the U,</v>

163
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.214
<v Speaker 1>s.so</v>
<v Speaker 1>at wants to export a lot of what it </v>

164
00:09:01.001 --> 00:09:01.834
<v Speaker 1>makes in order to make money and these </v>
<v Speaker 1>routes can be blocked at anytime by one </v>

165
00:09:05.531 --> 00:09:06.364
<v Speaker 1>of their neighboring countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which would stop all of that from </v>

166
00:09:07.691 --> 00:09:09.100
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Communist Party,</v>

167
00:09:09.190 --> 00:09:12.670
<v Speaker 1>the governing force in China also has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of mouths to feed,</v>

168
00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:16.510
<v Speaker 1>so control over this region is essential</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the party wants to stay in power.</v>

169
00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:17.363
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I can probably guess what you're </v>

170
00:09:18.071 --> 00:09:19.660
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably thinking,</v>

171
00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:20.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shiner isn't the only one.</v>

172
00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.000
<v Speaker 1>Many of the countries have no natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources either and they don't complain</v>

173
00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.330
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a big problem here being so</v>

174
00:09:28.331 --> 00:09:29.164
<v Speaker 1>dependent on imports and exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China only needs one country to block </v>

175
00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:35.770
<v Speaker 1>its roots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to collapse it in a matter of months,</v>

176
00:09:35.860 --> 00:09:36.693
<v Speaker 1>and as we mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many countries who would very </v>

177
00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:41.110
<v Speaker 1>happily do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially one in particular,</v>

178
00:09:41.470 --> 00:09:42.303
<v Speaker 1>and that's India.</v>

179
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:44.690
<v Speaker 3>You see the string of islands on the </v>
<v Speaker 3>Indian Ocean.</v>

180
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:45.603
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>these belong to India and the Indian </v>

181
00:09:46.791 --> 00:09:47.624
<v Speaker 3>army could block Chinese boats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This would mean that China couldn't buy </v>

182
00:09:56.710 --> 00:09:58.810
<v Speaker 3>most of the oil that they currently </v>
<v Speaker 3>consume.</v>

183
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.823
<v Speaker 3>Most of the oil tankers that go from the</v>
<v Speaker 3>Middle East to China pass through the </v>

184
00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:06.460
<v Speaker 3>Strait of Malacca right where Singapore </v>
<v Speaker 3>is.</v>

185
00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:07.473
<v Speaker 3>We're talking about almost 20 million </v>
<v Speaker 3>barrels of oil a day and many other </v>

186
00:10:11.111 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 3>goods in addition,</v>

187
00:10:12.220 --> 00:10:15.170
<v Speaker 1>but if India blocks the roots among </v>
<v Speaker 1>those small islands,</v>

188
00:10:15.530 --> 00:10:17.660
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to get that oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

189
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:21.380
<v Speaker 1>there is such an existential threat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>China that their former president,</v>

190
00:10:21.381 --> 00:10:25.070
<v Speaker 1>Hu Jintao,</v>
<v Speaker 1>used to call this the Malacca dilemma,</v>

191
00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:27.250
<v Speaker 1>and we're not just talking about India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

192
00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:30.530
<v Speaker 1>America isn't getting through their best</v>
<v Speaker 1>time when it comes to loving the Chinese</v>

193
00:10:30.531 --> 00:10:32.750
<v Speaker 1>either and again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American navy,</v>

194
00:10:32.751 --> 00:10:36.740
<v Speaker 1>it has the capabilities you block the </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil supply to China by sea.</v>

195
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:40.970
<v Speaker 1>This would be far more devastating than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any trade war so well.</v>

196
00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:41.833
<v Speaker 1>What's the solution?</v>

197
00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:48.100
<v Speaker 3>Belt and road initiative and its </v>
<v Speaker 3>maritime counterpart,</v>

198
00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.990
<v Speaker 3>the string of pearls.</v>

199
00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.953
<v Speaker 1>The belt and road initiative was </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiated by President Xi Jinping in </v>

200
00:10:53.841 --> 00:10:54.674
<v Speaker 1>2013 with the aim of rebuilding </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure and accelerating Chinese </v>

201
00:10:58.221 --> 00:10:59.600
<v Speaker 1>economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially,</v>

202
00:10:59.601 --> 00:11:02.660
<v Speaker 1>this is a brand new silk road and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>string of pearls,</v>

203
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:04.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's its maritime brother.</v>

204
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:05.383
<v Speaker 1>In 2017 Mr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>she pledged an additional $124 billion </v>

205
00:11:08.901 --> 00:11:13.730
<v Speaker 1>dollars towards says $900,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>belt and road initiative.</v>

206
00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:14.653
<v Speaker 1>China is promoting this global trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure as a longterm wind wind </v>

207
00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:20.440
<v Speaker 1>campaign for the 65 nations that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed up it.</v>

208
00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:21.463
<v Speaker 1>Most Western leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however they stayed away from the </v>

209
00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.773
<v Speaker 1>Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some is announcing the ambitious </v>

210
00:11:25.221 --> 00:11:26.054
<v Speaker 1>projects about so the 28 heads of state </v>
<v Speaker 1>presence at what Mr she called a </v>

211
00:11:29.031 --> 00:11:29.864
<v Speaker 1>gathering of great minds included </v>
<v Speaker 1>President Putin of Russia and President </v>

212
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>I get on of target.</v>

213
00:11:38.730 --> 00:11:42.240
<v Speaker 3>This is indeed a gathering of great </v>
<v Speaker 3>minds in the coming two days.</v>

214
00:11:42.241 --> 00:11:45.510
<v Speaker 3>I hope that by engaging in a full </v>
<v Speaker 3>exchange of views,</v>

215
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:48.720
<v Speaker 3>we will contribute to pursuing the belt </v>
<v Speaker 3>and road initiative,</v>

216
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:53.130
<v Speaker 3>a project of the century so that it will</v>
<v Speaker 3>benefit people across the world.</v>

217
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.070
<v Speaker 3>See jumping</v>

218
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.650
<v Speaker 1>with China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consolidating its power in relationships</v>

219
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:59.170
<v Speaker 1>with countries all over the south China </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sea region.</v>

220
00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.130
<v Speaker 1>It might become really difficult for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States to keep being the big boss</v>

221
00:12:03.131 --> 00:12:06.040
<v Speaker 1>in charge of the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If China was to support the US,</v>

222
00:12:06.070 --> 00:12:06.903
<v Speaker 1>the United States would lose all of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>deterrents power in this key region of </v>

223
00:12:10.001 --> 00:12:13.810
<v Speaker 1>the globe and this would completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>change the rules of international trade.</v>

224
00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.870
<v Speaker 1>Americans were pretty worried about this</v>
<v Speaker 1>now the other car,</v>

225
00:12:16.871 --> 00:12:21.400
<v Speaker 1>the CIA went so far as to state that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>US has two major problems right now,</v>

226
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 1>Russia and China and their efforts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>undermine the u.</v>

227
00:12:24.541 --> 00:12:28.360
<v Speaker 1>s is influencing key regions like Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the South China Sea,</v>

228
00:12:33.870 --> 00:12:34.703
<v Speaker 1>not naive and we are taking significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>steps on the counter intelligence side </v>

229
00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.090
<v Speaker 1>so that we have all the defenses that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>need us.</v>

230
00:12:41.091 --> 00:12:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Africa commands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>General Thomas Wallet Houser.</v>

231
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:45.133
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I know you're thinking you're </v>

232
00:12:45.470 --> 00:12:46.303
<v Speaker 1>probably thinking America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an empire all over the world and </v>

233
00:12:48.561 --> 00:12:50.330
<v Speaker 1>we're just talking about one small </v>
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>

234
00:12:50.331 --> 00:12:53.700
<v Speaker 1>the south China Sea and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's absolutely right.</v>

235
00:12:53.780 --> 00:12:54.613
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is only threatening us dominance </v>

236
00:12:56.511 --> 00:12:58.700
<v Speaker 1>in the south China Sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the whole world,</v>

237
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.743
<v Speaker 1>but this region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is the most important when it </v>

238
00:13:01.641 --> 00:13:06.020
<v Speaker 1>comes to international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why the struggle is quite so</v>

239
00:13:06.021 --> 00:13:08.390
<v Speaker 1>intense that the show,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still goes on.</v>

240
00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.600
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China knows that if it goes too far with</v>

241
00:13:16.601 --> 00:13:17.434
<v Speaker 1>building military basis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s will call on its allies in the </v>

242
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:20.584
<v Speaker 1>region to do the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would mean scaling up military </v>

243
00:13:23.141 --> 00:13:25.110
<v Speaker 1>spending and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and the US,</v>

244
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:27.400
<v Speaker 1>they might not be the best couple on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

245
00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:30.240
<v Speaker 1>but they kind of tolerate each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And also the US,</v>

246
00:13:30.241 --> 00:13:31.510
<v Speaker 1>his allies in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

247
00:13:31.511 --> 00:13:33.310
<v Speaker 1>they really do have a problem with </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

248
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.260
<v Speaker 1>We've got India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we mentioned previously.</v>

249
00:13:35.261 --> 00:13:36.094
<v Speaker 1>There's also Japan among others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and China does not want those guys to </v>

250
00:13:39.101 --> 00:13:41.740
<v Speaker 1>increase their military presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why so far,</v>

251
00:13:41.741 --> 00:13:42.574
<v Speaker 1>China is playing a very patient game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a very longterm challenge and </v>

252
00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:49.810
<v Speaker 1>longterm in Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that means really longterm.</v>

253
00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:54.100
<v Speaker 1>We might be talking about decades out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite the slow path,</v>

254
00:13:54.130 --> 00:13:54.963
<v Speaker 1>you'd better remember the term string of</v>
<v Speaker 1>pearls because it's going to appear a </v>

255
00:13:58.421 --> 00:14:00.070
<v Speaker 1>lot more in the newspapers.</v>

256
00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:06.333
<v Speaker 1>This is going to be so important that at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of next year on visual </v>

257
00:14:08.441 --> 00:14:10.540
<v Speaker 1>politic,</v>

258
00:14:10.541 --> 00:14:12.970
<v Speaker 1>about this in another series of videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we've got coming up,</v>

<v Speaker 1>But now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that the string of pedals </v>

262
00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:24.580
<v Speaker 1>is really such a threat to international</v>
<v Speaker 1>stability?</v>

263
00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:29.790
<v Speaker 1>Where does the US go from here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the beginning of the end for the</v>

264
00:14:30.461 --> 00:14:31.540
<v Speaker 1>American empire.</v>
