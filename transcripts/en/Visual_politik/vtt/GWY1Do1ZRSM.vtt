00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:11.170
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of bill?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just online threats from Baghdad?</v>

2
00:00:11.171 --> 00:00:12.004
<v Speaker 1>It seems probable that geography </v>
<v Speaker 1>students will seem to have to learn the </v>

3
00:00:14.171 --> 00:00:17.290
<v Speaker 1>name of this capital city as well as its</v>
<v Speaker 1>new country,</v>

4
00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.680
<v Speaker 1>and that would be a rocky Carter stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 25th of December this year.</v>

5
00:00:20.681 --> 00:00:21.514
<v Speaker 1>What's the historical moments for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 5 million Kurds who currently </v>

6
00:00:24.341 --> 00:00:27.070
<v Speaker 1>live in this autonomous community in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>north of Iraq?</v>

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why was this?</v>

8
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because of after decades of </v>

9
00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.780
<v Speaker 1>unfulfilled promises and ethnic </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>

10
00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.643
<v Speaker 1>they have the opportunity to vote in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>referendum organized by the regional </v>

11
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:44.180
<v Speaker 1>governments of Kurdistan since 2005 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the constitution of Iran,</v>

12
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.170
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan is an autonomous region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite it being an autonomous region,</v>

13
00:00:48.171 --> 00:00:52.190
<v Speaker 1>though this place essentially works as </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's own almost independent country,</v>

14
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.113
<v Speaker 1>and the result of this was that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population really wanted to be fully </v>

15
00:00:55.521 --> 00:00:56.354
<v Speaker 1>independent.</v>

16
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.673
<v Speaker 1>The day of the referendum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurds showed up on mass to the polling </v>

17
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.824
<v Speaker 1>stations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the speakers of mosques encouraged </v>

18
00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:08.310
<v Speaker 1>voters to go to the polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:01:08.311 --> 00:01:11.790
<v Speaker 1>the final results showed the referendum </v>
<v Speaker 1>was a complete success.</v>

20
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>More than seven out of every 10 Kurds </v>
<v Speaker 1>went to vote.</v>

21
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.360
<v Speaker 1>That's almost 3.1 million voters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The victory.</v>

22
00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.223
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was overwhelming for those who </v>

23
00:01:20.051 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>supported independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the movements it's obtained.</v>

24
00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>92.73% of the vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what's what?</v>

25
00:01:26.041 --> 00:01:26.874
<v Speaker 1>This triumph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's totally understandable because </v>

26
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:32.070
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about some of the most ill</v>
<v Speaker 1>treated people in history.</v>

27
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.670
<v Speaker 1>They will treat it despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kurds are recording to many experts,</v>

28
00:01:35.671 --> 00:01:38.270
<v Speaker 1>the most ancient people in this entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

29
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.930
<v Speaker 1>It is estimated that their culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their language,</v>

30
00:01:44.931 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>their rituals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially everything that could define</v>

31
00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:48.344
<v Speaker 1>them have been in this part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's upper Mesopotamia for more than </v>

32
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.420
<v Speaker 1>4,000 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

33
00:01:53.421 --> 00:01:56.380
<v Speaker 1>many of these experts consider the city </v>
<v Speaker 1>center of Erbil,</v>

34
00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:57.214
<v Speaker 1>the capital as the oldest human </v>
<v Speaker 1>settlement to be continuously inhabited </v>

35
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.520
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

36
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.750
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kurds Zam bolder than the Persians,</v>

37
00:02:09.751 --> 00:02:11.280
<v Speaker 1>or indeed the Arabs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

38
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.070
<v Speaker 1>they have suffered from all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>persecution.</v>

39
00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.900
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the total number of kids is it rounds at</v>

40
00:02:15.901 --> 00:02:18.810
<v Speaker 1>30 million spread across mainly for </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

41
00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>

42
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.270
<v Speaker 1>Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Iraq.</v>

43
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.600
<v Speaker 1>Well in all of these places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kurds have suffered the consequences</v>

44
00:02:24.601 --> 00:02:25.434
<v Speaker 1>of nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is trying to make them disappear </v>

45
00:02:27.231 --> 00:02:29.970
<v Speaker 1>as a community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've tried to do ends their culture,</v>

46
00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.863
<v Speaker 1>their language,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as trying to close down their </v>

47
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:33.384
<v Speaker 1>media outlets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between 1986 and 1989 Saddam Hussein </v>

48
00:02:36.751 --> 00:02:37.584
<v Speaker 1>launched the amf full campaign and </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimation saw the between 50,002 </v>

49
00:02:41.311 --> 00:02:44.670
<v Speaker 1>180,000 Kurds died.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result,</v>

50
00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.460
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this cannot easily be forgotten.</v>

51
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather had a good sense of </v>
<v Speaker 1>humor.</v>

52
00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:52.080
<v Speaker 1>He used to say that he was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred in a free country.</v>

53
00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.390
<v Speaker 1>Then the Ottomans arrived and said to my</v>
<v Speaker 1>grandfather,</v>

54
00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>your Ottoman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the fall of the Ottoman empire,</v>

55
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.480
<v Speaker 1>he became Turkish.</v>

56
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>The church left and he became a gert.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then the British arrived,</v>

57
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.430
<v Speaker 1>so my grandfather became a subject of </v>
<v Speaker 1>his Gracious Majesty.</v>

58
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:06.340
<v Speaker 1>The British invented Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so my grandfather became Iraqi,</v>

59
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.300
<v Speaker 1>but to his dying breath,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was never proud of being Iraqi in air</v>

60
00:03:09.301 --> 00:03:10.900
<v Speaker 1>or saline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My father's rifle,</v>

61
00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:13.540
<v Speaker 1>a childhood in Kurdistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considering the history,</v>

62
00:03:13.541 --> 00:03:14.374
<v Speaker 1>it's no surprise that the Kurds once,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once and for all to make the dream of </v>

63
00:03:17.291 --> 00:03:20.420
<v Speaker 1>having their own state come true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if we add up the facts,</v>

64
00:03:20.421 --> 00:03:21.254
<v Speaker 1>there's Iraqi had a stone is quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich area in terms of oil and natural </v>

65
00:03:23.981 --> 00:03:25.930
<v Speaker 1>gas as well as fresh water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

66
00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.750
<v Speaker 1>we can understand even more why they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want independence.</v>

67
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.100
<v Speaker 1>So just some of,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cause they wanted that right and country</v>

68
00:03:31.101 --> 00:03:33.700
<v Speaker 1>and say they held a referendum in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do that.</v>

69
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.820
<v Speaker 2>The referendum,</v>

70
00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.853
<v Speaker 1>as we have said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan is almost an independent </v>

71
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:46.104
<v Speaker 1>country already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They even have their own army of more </v>

72
00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:48.444
<v Speaker 1>than 200,000 soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This army is called the Peshmerga and </v>

73
00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:52.501
<v Speaker 1>they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

74
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:55.050
<v Speaker 1>he'd been the main defense to Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>state in Iraq.</v>

75
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.530
<v Speaker 1>Do bear this in mind because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments of Kurdistan is a close ally</v>

76
00:03:58.531 --> 00:03:59.510
<v Speaker 1>of Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

77
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.580
<v Speaker 1>it may be their most loyal ally in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region because of this,</v>

78
00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:05.940
<v Speaker 1>the u s has trained,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financed and well armed their army.</v>

79
00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.390
<v Speaker 1>So I'm indeed even save that the Kurds </v>
<v Speaker 1>are as pro American is the taxes.</v>

80
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>So after many difficult years of intense</v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting against Islamic state,</v>

81
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.423
<v Speaker 1>it has been clear for the Kurds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are almost no advantages in </v>

82
00:04:22.771 --> 00:04:23.604
<v Speaker 1>remaining in Iraq and the governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a bill took advantage of these </v>

83
00:04:25.771 --> 00:04:29.190
<v Speaker 1>battles in order to integrate curd areas</v>
<v Speaker 1>into that political space.</v>

84
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.053
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is the province of Coco who has a </v>

85
00:04:31.981 --> 00:04:35.910
<v Speaker 1>majority of Kurds but was not within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>autonomous region of Kurdistan.</v>

86
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:36.773
<v Speaker 1>Go Cook is something of a crown jewel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And one of the main reasons for the </v>

87
00:04:39.271 --> 00:04:41.730
<v Speaker 1>conflict with the Iraqi government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

88
00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:44.850
<v Speaker 1>as not hesitate to just send their </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops over to recover the settlements.</v>

89
00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:48.870
<v Speaker 1>Iraqi forces sweep into Kirkuk checking </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish independence drive.</v>

90
00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.390
<v Speaker 1>So why is this territory so valuable?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

91
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.253
<v Speaker 1>that's because curt cook is the province</v>
<v Speaker 1>that contains the most Eileen Curtis </v>

92
00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.340
<v Speaker 1>start.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

93
00:04:56.341 --> 00:04:57.174
<v Speaker 1>it's been estimated that around 10% of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all Iraqi oil reserves are concentrated </v>

94
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:02.730
<v Speaker 1>here in car cooked and nobody wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>let</v>

95
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:03.643
<v Speaker 2>good</v>

96
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:07.643
<v Speaker 1>in 2007 a referendum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It should have been conducted in order </v>

97
00:05:09.721 --> 00:05:13.200
<v Speaker 1>to incorporate or not the autonomous </v>
<v Speaker 1>region of Kurdistan.</v>

98
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.250
<v Speaker 1>The voting in never took place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the peshmerga occupying the city</v>

99
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:19.080
<v Speaker 1>in order to protect it from Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>state,</v>

100
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>since the Iraqi army had literally run </v>
<v Speaker 1>away,</v>

101
00:05:21.751 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>the curd governments had facto annexed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the territory.</v>

102
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.673
<v Speaker 1>So with these conditions and with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constant negotiations between Baghdad </v>

103
00:05:28.921 --> 00:05:32.670
<v Speaker 1>and beale men's with a growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>disconnect between both territories,</v>

104
00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.563
<v Speaker 1>they eventually got the referendum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the first time in history that </v>

105
00:05:37.471 --> 00:05:40.110
<v Speaker 1>the people of Kurdistan will freely </v>
<v Speaker 1>decide their future.</v>

106
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:41.003
<v Speaker 1>After that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will start talks with Baghdad to </v>

107
00:05:42.331 --> 00:05:44.880
<v Speaker 1>reach an agreement over borders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>water and oil.</v>

108
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Mister Barzani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of Iraqi Kurdistan,</v>

109
00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:48.533
<v Speaker 1>now the governments of Iraq at post this</v>
<v Speaker 1>referendum in every way as a </v>

110
00:05:51.841 --> 00:05:52.674
<v Speaker 1>constitutional court of Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even our Lord is parliaments asked for </v>

111
00:05:55.261 --> 00:05:56.094
<v Speaker 1>many things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the withdrawal of </v>

112
00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:58.333
<v Speaker 1>representation in our bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lee bought a clothes and even army </v>

113
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:01.574
<v Speaker 1>deployments in Kirkuk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There was also the prosecution of </v>

114
00:06:03.681 --> 00:06:05.510
<v Speaker 1>organizers of the referendum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's,</v>

115
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:07.610
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parliament tried their best to remain in</v>

116
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 1>control of all of the oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But even with this kind of action by the</v>

117
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>Iraqi government to the Kurds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't really care.</v>

118
00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:18.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

119
00:06:18.670 --> 00:06:21.940
<v Speaker 1>That's the only logical because despite </v>
<v Speaker 1>the progress of the Iraqi army,</v>

120
00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000
<v Speaker 1>the risk for Kurdistan is probably not </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Iraq,</v>

121
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.310
<v Speaker 1>but rather with the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>community,</v>

122
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.173
<v Speaker 1>you see Turkey and Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't even want to hear about an </v>

123
00:06:30.671 --> 00:06:31.504
<v Speaker 1>independent Kurdistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because it might give the Kurds </v>

124
00:06:33.461 --> 00:06:36.610
<v Speaker 1>in their territory is the idea that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>can replicate this success.</v>

125
00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:37.483
<v Speaker 1>So lucky for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's been at war with the Kurds for </v>

126
00:06:38.771 --> 00:06:41.140
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a story for another day.</v>

127
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.003
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that these countries have </v>
<v Speaker 1>allied with Iraq in order to defy the </v>

128
00:06:45.821 --> 00:06:46.654
<v Speaker 1>referendum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey's military has confirmed that </v>

129
00:06:49.271 --> 00:06:50.104
<v Speaker 1>Turkey and Iraq will conduct a joint </v>
<v Speaker 1>military drills in Turkey along an area </v>

130
00:06:53.291 --> 00:06:55.870
<v Speaker 1>bordering Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semi autonomous Kurdish region.</v>

131
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.853
<v Speaker 1>Iran's semiofficial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I s n a news agency reported on Sunday </v>

132
00:07:00.790 --> 00:07:03.070
<v Speaker 1>that the Supreme National Security </v>
<v Speaker 1>Council,</v>

133
00:07:03.071 --> 00:07:03.904
<v Speaker 1>a closed Iranian airspace to the Iraqi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdish area at the request of the </v>

134
00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:10.330
<v Speaker 1>central government in Baghdad and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no way,</v>

135
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.910
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about the possibility of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts after all,</v>

136
00:07:12.911 --> 00:07:15.040
<v Speaker 1>this is likely to be the result of fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>tactics,</v>

137
00:07:15.041 --> 00:07:18.340
<v Speaker 1>which are very usual in this kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and they rarely work.</v>

138
00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:19.173
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember Kurdistan is a close ally of </v>

139
00:07:20.651 --> 00:07:24.070
<v Speaker 1>the USA and they haven't experienced and</v>
<v Speaker 1>well trained army?</v>

140
00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.953
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bigger issue here might be that </v>

141
00:07:25.871 --> 00:07:26.704
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan they need then neighbors this </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory it's landlocked and as they </v>

142
00:07:30.311 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>are very dependent on Turkey both in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to export their oil,</v>

143
00:07:33.791 --> 00:07:36.100
<v Speaker 1>Dan to import anything that they might </v>
<v Speaker 1>meet,</v>

144
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.963
<v Speaker 1>so a trade blockade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a serious threat for this </v>

145
00:07:39.761 --> 00:07:40.594
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The KRG is economy depends on one </v>

146
00:07:43.661 --> 00:07:44.494
<v Speaker 1>pipeline that sells oil to international</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets and that pipeline goes through </v>

147
00:07:47.591 --> 00:07:49.510
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You shut down that pipeline,</v>

148
00:07:49.540 --> 00:07:50.373
<v Speaker 1>you choke the Kurdish economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bilal Wahab analysts at the Washington </v>

149
00:07:53.411 --> 00:07:54.244
<v Speaker 1>Institute for Near East Policy Bounce </v>
<v Speaker 1>there is more to it than just their </v>

150
00:07:56.961 --> 00:07:57.794
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nobody wants any more tension with this </v>

151
00:07:59.351 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internationally speaking,</v>

152
00:08:01.571 --> 00:08:02.404
<v Speaker 1>the referendum didn't get much support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The U S as opposed to it and Antonio </v>

153
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:06.543
<v Speaker 1>Guitars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secretary general of the UN has </v>

154
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:08.374
<v Speaker 1>described it as dangerous and </v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially disruptive and today Israel </v>

155
00:08:11.561 --> 00:08:13.420
<v Speaker 1>is the only country that supports </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

156
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:15.610
<v Speaker 1>So this might mean the future is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking very good.</v>

157
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:17.290
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well wait just a second because it's,</v>

158
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:18.124
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very likely the Kurdistan will </v>

159
00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:21.640
<v Speaker 1>achieve independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

160
00:08:21.641 --> 00:08:22.474
<v Speaker 1>or later.</v>

161
00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:36.310
<v Speaker 1>The reasons for a new country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraqi Kurdistan,</v>

162
00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.820
<v Speaker 1>it's got many issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

163
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:41.330
<v Speaker 1>they have managed to become the region </v>
<v Speaker 1>that functions the best in Iraq.</v>

164
00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:45.290
<v Speaker 1>They are the safest and wealthiest area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been to Iraqi,</v>

165
00:08:45.291 --> 00:08:46.124
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan and number of times it's safer</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Kansas if you're coming from </v>

166
00:08:49.041 --> 00:08:51.680
<v Speaker 1>Baghdad or muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's practically Switzerland.</v>

167
00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:54.830
<v Speaker 1>Michael J totten American journalists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

168
00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:55.723
<v Speaker 1>In 2014 before the irs offensive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this region was turning into the most </v>

169
00:08:58.711 --> 00:09:02.020
<v Speaker 1>relevant financial and tourist spot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and oasis.</v>

170
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Many businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both local and foreign skyscrapers,</v>

171
00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>moles and mentions where it's spreading </v>
<v Speaker 1>like mushrooms after the rain.</v>

172
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.190
<v Speaker 1>That was until Walbro broke out in Iraq </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the Islamic state.</v>

173
00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.060
<v Speaker 1>Then most of this development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's empty.</v>

174
00:09:13.061 --> 00:09:16.980
<v Speaker 1>You have to stop now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often an awful few years of walk in 2017</v>

175
00:09:17.010 --> 00:09:17.843
<v Speaker 1>the numbers at bouncing back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you remember that this area is </v>

176
00:09:20.011 --> 00:09:20.844
<v Speaker 1>oil rich?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some estimations calculate the oil </v>

177
00:09:22.441 --> 00:09:25.350
<v Speaker 1>reserves of Kurdistan at 45 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrels,</v>

178
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:26.213
<v Speaker 1>but this into words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan would be among the 15 oil </v>

179
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:29.514
<v Speaker 1>richest countries on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't a country with this or </v>

180
00:09:32.221 --> 00:09:36.870
<v Speaker 1>more than 5 million inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still so much more it rugs.</v>

181
00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Kurdistan is quite business friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

182
00:09:39.300 --> 00:09:40.133
<v Speaker 1>They like private initiatives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something uncommon in this part of the </v>

183
00:09:42.391 --> 00:09:43.224
<v Speaker 1>globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The taxes are also attractive and </v>

184
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.174
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy is not excessive either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately though there is still </v>

185
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:48.954
<v Speaker 1>plenty of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Kurdistan government will do its </v>

186
00:09:51.241 --> 00:09:54.240
<v Speaker 1>best to help the private sector and have</v>
<v Speaker 1>them invest here.</v>

187
00:09:54.270 --> 00:09:55.103
<v Speaker 1>I invite all local and foreign investors</v>
<v Speaker 1>here to take advantage of our laws and </v>

188
00:09:58.591 --> 00:10:02.730
<v Speaker 1>offers and invest Masoud Barzani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of Iraqi Kurdistan.</v>

189
00:10:02.760 --> 00:10:06.180
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that this region has enough</v>
<v Speaker 1>going for it to make a Kurdistan,</v>

190
00:10:06.270 --> 00:10:08.160
<v Speaker 1>a prosperous country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their first,</v>

191
00:10:08.161 --> 00:10:08.994
<v Speaker 1>our lambs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high levels of safety and natural </v>

192
00:10:10.561 --> 00:10:13.260
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether they're geographical location is</v>

193
00:10:13.261 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>beneficial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a place between Turkey,</v>

194
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:16.860
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Iraq.</v>

195
00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.050
<v Speaker 1>But on top of all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new country,</v>

196
00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:21.860
<v Speaker 1>it's only,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well there because people then,</v>

197
00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:22.703
<v Speaker 1>especially Iraqi Kurds had been deported</v>
<v Speaker 1>attacks with chemical weapons and have </v>

198
00:10:25.541 --> 00:10:29.580
<v Speaker 1>suffered all sorts of social engineering</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to strangle their culture.</v>

199
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.473
<v Speaker 1>And now they have an opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build their own country for the rest of </v>

200
00:10:33.511 --> 00:10:34.344
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could also benefits from a more </v>

201
00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:35.934
<v Speaker 1>moderate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperous and to free country than the </v>

202
00:10:37.561 --> 00:10:40.740
<v Speaker 1>ones around it in the Middle East would </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly be better for us.</v>

203
00:10:40.770 --> 00:10:43.470
<v Speaker 1>So now we've got to consider the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems in Iraqi Kurdistan.</v>

204
00:10:43.471 --> 00:10:44.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>

205
00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:45.120
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're ready.</v>

206
00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:45.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

207
00:10:45.961 --> 00:10:46.794
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that's no excuse to not make this </v>

208
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.500
<v Speaker 1>new country happen first because these </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems exist now with them still being</v>

209
00:10:52.501 --> 00:10:53.334
<v Speaker 1>a part of Iraq and seconds because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>are less serious than the ones in the </v>

210
00:10:56.311 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>rest of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what about corruption?</v>

211
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.460
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's totally there.</v>

212
00:10:59.461 --> 00:11:01.650
<v Speaker 1>And is there oil dependency also?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

213
00:11:01.651 --> 00:11:02.760
<v Speaker 1>And what about debt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

214
00:11:02.761 --> 00:11:04.260
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is that too.</v>

215
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 1>But this is totally normal in this part </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the wells because the rest of Iraq is</v>

216
00:11:08.281 --> 00:11:09.780
<v Speaker 1>in a much worse situation.</v>

217
00:11:09.810 --> 00:11:12.000
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we just wished that bag Dan's a response</v>

218
00:11:12.001 --> 00:11:14.700
<v Speaker 1>does not turn the situation into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>military conflicts.</v>

219
00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:17.250
<v Speaker 1>That would be a terrible scenario for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

220
00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:18.213
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be a situation where political </v>

221
00:11:19.741 --> 00:11:22.260
<v Speaker 1>interests prevail above the interests of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people,</v>

222
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:23.094
<v Speaker 1>but now it's time for your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you support the idea of the </v>

223
00:11:25.441 --> 00:11:27.150
<v Speaker 1>independence of Kurdistan?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

224
