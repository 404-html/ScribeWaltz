1
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.600
<v Speaker 1>In teenagers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either historical,</v>

2
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>median cartel data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar has an idea,</v>

3
00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.820
<v Speaker 1>basically he had a vision,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly have a dream,</v>

4
00:00:15.821 --> 00:00:18.470
<v Speaker 1>and that was to turn Columbia into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>narco state,</v>

5
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:19.343
<v Speaker 1>the country where the governments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>all public institutions would be </v>

6
00:00:22.061 --> 00:00:25.270
<v Speaker 1>directly controlled by drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such was his commitment.</v>

7
00:00:25.271 --> 00:00:28.270
<v Speaker 1>That's in 1982 as I think you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>

8
00:00:28.271 --> 00:00:29.104
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar himself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important mobsters in </v>

9
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:32.793
<v Speaker 1>all of history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gained a seat at the Columbian Chamber </v>

10
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.810
<v Speaker 1>of Representatives and it's important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>bear in mind that it's one thing for the</v>

11
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:41.644
<v Speaker 1>mafia to buy or bribe a politician and </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite another for them to hold all the </v>

12
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:46.294
<v Speaker 1>power directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine a country where the </v>

13
00:00:48.251 --> 00:00:49.270
<v Speaker 1>police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the army,</v>

14
00:00:49.271 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 1>all administrative officials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even the courts themselves as well,</v>

15
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:55.900
<v Speaker 1>timidly under the direct orders of drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealers.</v>

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.793
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Pablo Escobar's vision had panned </v>

17
00:00:58.061 --> 00:00:58.894
<v Speaker 1>out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia wouldn't certainly have much </v>

18
00:00:59.921 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 1>higher levels of drug production and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports,</v>

19
00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:05.110
<v Speaker 1>but the median cartel itself would </v>
<v Speaker 1>become untouchable.</v>

20
00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.003
<v Speaker 1>Invincible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would've gained complete impunity to </v>

21
00:01:08.081 --> 00:01:10.990
<v Speaker 1>do and undo whatever he wanted at.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

22
00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.900
<v Speaker 1>fortunately Pablo Escobar never managed </v>
<v Speaker 1>to carry out his dream.</v>

23
00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

24
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.723
<v Speaker 1>three decades later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like his dream is now being </v>

25
00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:18.874
<v Speaker 1>realized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time we're not talking about </v>

26
00:01:20.471 --> 00:01:22.930
<v Speaker 1>Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about Venezuela,</v>

27
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Columbia dictum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wounded,</v>

28
00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>seeing grapples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbiana,</v>

29
00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.900
<v Speaker 1>Archean minutes with dealer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

30
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:42.940
<v Speaker 1>Cmo that apparently the four characters </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at right now,</v>

31
00:01:42.941 --> 00:01:43.774
<v Speaker 1>don't only control the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are also the leaders of an </v>

32
00:01:45.881 --> 00:01:48.910
<v Speaker 1>international crime and drug trafficking</v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

33
00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.890
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about Nicolas Maduro,</v>

34
00:01:50.891 --> 00:01:53.440
<v Speaker 1>the president of Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dios data Qbo,</v>

35
00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>the powerful presidents of the National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Constituent Assembly who already rank as</v>

36
00:01:57.851 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>the strongest man in the regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tarek,</v>

37
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.113
<v Speaker 1>El Assami format,</v>
<v Speaker 1>vice presidents and current Minister of </v>

38
00:02:03.311 --> 00:02:04.144
<v Speaker 1>Industry and national production whose </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal fortune according to dea </v>

39
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.600
<v Speaker 1>calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surpasses the $3,000,000,000 mark.</v>

40
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.750
<v Speaker 1>And the fourth is Nestor Rivera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minister of internal affairs,</v>

41
00:02:13.751 --> 00:02:15.640
<v Speaker 1>justice and peace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who could top it all off.</v>

42
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:18.730
<v Speaker 1>Was the previous national accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an architect's office director.</v>

43
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything indicates that these four </v>

44
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 1>people are leading the transformation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela into a narco state.</v>

45
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>Listen Up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mafia takes control.</v>

46
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.530
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is in shreds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hunger is increasing,</v>

47
00:02:37.531 --> 00:02:38.364
<v Speaker 1>inflation is out of control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and hundreds of thousands of people are </v>

48
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.740
<v Speaker 1>fleeing the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even hospitals don't have basic supplies</v>

49
00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:45.480
<v Speaker 1>like medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>analytical equipment,</v>

50
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.463
<v Speaker 1>or pastors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's such a huge mess that the vsa </v>

51
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.433
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan state owned oil company </v>

52
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:53.310
<v Speaker 1>with the most reserves in the world is </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt.</v>

53
00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.070
<v Speaker 2>Consider</v>

54
00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.460
<v Speaker 1>this to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pdvsa has many embargoed waters.</v>

55
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.670
<v Speaker 1>There's in order to sell the </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly dwindling Venezuelan oil,</v>

56
00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.533
<v Speaker 1>it's beginning to resort to do tricks </v>
<v Speaker 1>and techniques used by Hollywood movie </v>

57
00:03:07.331 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>style smugglers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

58
00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:11.194
<v Speaker 1>since Venezuelan oil companies are at </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk of being confiscated to settle all </v>

59
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:15.274
<v Speaker 1>outstanding debts on the oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they transport pdvsa has begun to </v>

60
00:03:18.161 --> 00:03:18.994
<v Speaker 1>transfer oil from its ships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do other ships with the Cuban flag out </v>

61
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:22.924
<v Speaker 1>at sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These ships are then responsible for </v>

62
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:29.071
<v Speaker 1>taking the crude oil to its destination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thus avoiding being seized because folks</v>

63
00:03:29.891 --> 00:03:30.724
<v Speaker 1>in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>practically everything that has value </v>

64
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:33.693
<v Speaker 1>has been or is being looted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Corruption has reached almost every </v>

65
00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:38.163
<v Speaker 1>corner of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the Bolivarian Revolution promised </v>

66
00:03:40.391 --> 00:03:41.224
<v Speaker 1>prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What they forgot to clarify is that all </v>

67
00:03:43.061 --> 00:03:46.420
<v Speaker 1>that prosperity would only be for a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the friends of the revolution.</v>

68
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.890
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me?</v>

69
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>take a look at this.</v>

70
00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.233
<v Speaker 1>Many regime members promote and lead </v>
<v Speaker 1>operations for gas contraband to </v>

71
00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:55.983
<v Speaker 1>southern Brazil and Colombia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are also mostly responsible for </v>

72
00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.343
<v Speaker 1>food and medicine contrabands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the state buys and then sells on </v>

73
00:04:01.571 --> 00:04:02.404
<v Speaker 1>the black market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have looted public accounts and </v>

74
00:04:04.121 --> 00:04:07.450
<v Speaker 1>tens of billions of dollars have </v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared from the government and from</v>

75
00:04:07.451 --> 00:04:12.451
<v Speaker 1>the PDVSA in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the central banks,</v>

76
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:14.520
<v Speaker 1>US dollars have been looted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

77
00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:15.880
<v Speaker 1>you really did hear that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

78
00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:16.813
<v Speaker 1>That allow me to explain this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the first things that the Chavez </v>

79
00:04:18.701 --> 00:04:21.850
<v Speaker 1>regime did was implement a rigid </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange control.</v>

80
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.020
<v Speaker 1>They fixed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

81
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:23.854
<v Speaker 1>the official exchange between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>boulevard and the US dollar to a rate </v>

82
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:29.230
<v Speaker 1>that had nothing to do with the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the street.</v>

83
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>That way the government's friends could </v>
<v Speaker 1>access US dollars with just a handful of</v>

84
00:04:33.401 --> 00:04:34.234
<v Speaker 1>Bolivares bolivares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That gives it the country's current </v>

85
00:04:35.951 --> 00:04:38.980
<v Speaker 1>hyper inflation knob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with practically nothing,</v>

86
00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.273
<v Speaker 1>the minivan was so well perfected that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that 20 percent of all </v>

87
00:04:44.291 --> 00:04:45.124
<v Speaker 1>imports declared in recent years have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been completely false operations that </v>

88
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:48.904
<v Speaker 1>were done for the sole purpose of </v>
<v Speaker 1>obtaining dollars at the official </v>

89
00:04:51.491 --> 00:04:54.670
<v Speaker 1>exchange rate and then to save them in </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign accounts.</v>

90
00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:56.980
<v Speaker 1>And this is important because according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to estimates,</v>

91
00:04:56.981 --> 00:04:57.814
<v Speaker 1>we could be talking about a theft of </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a hundred billion dollars and </v>

92
00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.700
<v Speaker 1>of course be Dvsa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't escaped this plunder.</v>

93
00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:12.790
<v Speaker 1>A group of companies lent seven point 2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion boulevard to PD vsa,</v>

94
00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.770
<v Speaker 1>which when exchange at the black market </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate would be about $42,</v>

95
00:05:16.771 --> 00:05:17.604
<v Speaker 1>million dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when exchange at the official rate </v>

96
00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:20.373
<v Speaker 1>would become approximately $600,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars which were deposited in </v>

97
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:27.340
<v Speaker 1>an account in Malta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>CSR but t's Venezuelan journalists,</v>

98
00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.203
<v Speaker 1>but of course sins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more can be squeezed out of the </v>

99
00:05:29.651 --> 00:05:30.484
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The regime Johnson sought a new </v>

100
00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.220
<v Speaker 1>alternative source of income.</v>

101
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:35.250
<v Speaker 3>Put up your faith,</v>
<v Speaker 3>put up your faith.</v>

102
00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.820
<v Speaker 3>I said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

103
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:43.690
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>

104
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:52.520
<v Speaker 3>no,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no.</v>

105
00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:00.543
<v Speaker 4>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they look</v>

106
00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:10.383
<v Speaker 1>it for you.</v>

107
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:12.600
<v Speaker 2>So no,</v>

108
00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>turning into a narco state</v>

109
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>of drug dealers in Venezuela isn't new </v>
<v Speaker 1>med.</v>

110
00:06:25.491 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 1>Has however evolved and I want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain for years,</v>

111
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:29.354
<v Speaker 1>Colombian cartels trying to use routes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Venezuela to distribute that </v>

112
00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:34.430
<v Speaker 1>product.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then of course to do so,</v>

113
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 1>they began bing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>policemen,</v>

114
00:06:36.051 --> 00:06:38.120
<v Speaker 1>national guard members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high officials,</v>

115
00:06:38.121 --> 00:06:38.954
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people would then turn a blind </v>

116
00:06:40.791 --> 00:06:43.930
<v Speaker 1>eye.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the first stage as it works.</v>

117
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Dealer's got to know the land batter and</v>
<v Speaker 1>figured out who they could trust and who</v>

118
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:48.674
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they moved into the second stage of </v>

119
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:51.770
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was something like,</v>

120
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:53.270
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that we have a deal,</v>

121
00:06:53.271 --> 00:06:56.330
<v Speaker 1>I'll give you some more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you don't only look away.</v>

122
00:06:56.331 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>You've also got to protect me and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transport my merchandise.</v>

123
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:03.710
<v Speaker 1>And this second stage was implemented </v>
<v Speaker 1>later.</v>

124
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:04.573
<v Speaker 1>Many Colombian mobsters realized that </v>
<v Speaker 1>given the enormous pressure that they </v>

125
00:07:07.071 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 1>had from the Colombian government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the dea,</v>

126
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:12.980
<v Speaker 1>that'd be safer in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at the beginning of the 21st century,</v>

127
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.843
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any of these sinister merchants moved </v>

128
00:07:16.481 --> 00:07:17.314
<v Speaker 1>their operation centers from Columbia to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela and that's when they started </v>

129
00:07:21.151 --> 00:07:24.160
<v Speaker 1>to closely collaborate with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities there.</v>

130
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 1>And I mean really</v>

131
00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:26.723
<v Speaker 2>sleep</v>

132
00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:28.933
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the Venezuelan </v>

133
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.710
<v Speaker 1>government did them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

134
00:07:30.711 --> 00:07:31.544
<v Speaker 1>and then 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to expel the dea from </v>

135
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:35.174
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela and territory and suspends </v>
<v Speaker 1>their agreements to monitor knockout </v>

136
00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:39.920
<v Speaker 1>flights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

137
00:07:39.921 --> 00:07:40.754
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan and territory became a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of refuge for drug trafficking in the </v>

138
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:45.800
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could no longer keep track of them.</v>

139
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.450
<v Speaker 1>They're pretty fantastic for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

140
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.433
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in exchange for getting rid of the </v>

141
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to pay a modest commission.</v>

142
00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 1>The regime johns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed to live off something.</v>

143
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>that was the third stage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on.</v>

145
00:07:57.321 --> 00:07:58.154
<v Speaker 1>One moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit because that's how we got to the </v>

146
00:07:59.151 --> 00:08:01.940
<v Speaker 1>fourth and last stage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is where we're at,</v>

147
00:08:01.970 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was going well so well.</v>

148
00:08:05.961 --> 00:08:06.794
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's plenty of the Bolivarian </v>

149
00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:08.360
<v Speaker 1>Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really.</v>

150
00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>Leaders asked themselves a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the government,</v>

151
00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.140
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the army,</v>

152
00:08:12.200 --> 00:08:13.033
<v Speaker 1>and did a lot of resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why on earth should we share anything </v>

153
00:08:15.381 --> 00:08:17.510
<v Speaker 1>with the Colombians sold?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoever else?</v>

154
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Let's those couples that are</v>

155
00:08:22.400 --> 00:08:24.500
<v Speaker 1>Columbiana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Archean minutes.</v>

156
00:08:24.501 --> 00:08:25.334
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry.</v>

157
00:08:25.340 --> 00:08:26.320
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what happened then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:29.700
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan authorities began </v>
<v Speaker 1>arresting all of the drug traffickers,</v>

159
00:08:29.701 --> 00:08:30.534
<v Speaker 1>so you didn't want to cooperate with </v>
<v Speaker 1>them by giving that route says well as </v>

160
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.124
<v Speaker 1>their distribution business to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how people such as Maximiliano </v>

161
00:08:38.210 --> 00:08:38.631
<v Speaker 1>Bonnier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>AK,</v>

162
00:08:38.631 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 1>if an NCR know the chief of the office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heck Taught Harnaman,</v>

163
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:47.080
<v Speaker 1>we Terago Aka Martin Yan Os Diego Perez,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aka Diego restaurant,</v>

164
00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and Daniel baret rubber re run naked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Loco fell.</v>

165
00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:53.810
<v Speaker 1>All of them were found in the list of </v>
<v Speaker 1>most significant traffic,</v>

166
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 1>so everything</v>

167
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v Speaker 5>indicates that right now in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 5>even though there are tons of criminal </v>

168
00:08:59.431 --> 00:09:00.264
<v Speaker 5>groups operating in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 5>the government giants hold the ultimate </v>

169
00:09:03.331 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 5>control and control to characters like </v>
<v Speaker 5>del Dotto,</v>

170
00:09:06.151 --> 00:09:09.720
<v Speaker 5>Kobe allegedly the most important leader</v>
<v Speaker 5>of the cartel,</v>

171
00:09:09.721 --> 00:09:12.810
<v Speaker 5>the cartel formed by the leaders of the </v>
<v Speaker 5>Bolivarian government's.</v>

172
00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.523
<v Speaker 5>The Venezuelan people suffer under </v>
<v Speaker 5>corrupt politicians who tighten their </v>

173
00:09:17.451 --> 00:09:20.180
<v Speaker 5>grip overpower while lining their own </v>
<v Speaker 5>pockets.</v>

174
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:22.980
<v Speaker 5>We are imposing costs on figures like </v>
<v Speaker 5>Dios,</v>

175
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:23.823
<v Speaker 5>Datto Cabello,</v>
<v Speaker 5>who exploited their official positions </v>

176
00:09:26.001 --> 00:09:29.240
<v Speaker 5>to engage in narcotics trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 5>money laundering,</v>

177
00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:32.720
<v Speaker 5>and Basil Mint of state funds and other </v>
<v Speaker 5>corrupt activities.</v>

178
00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:35.090
<v Speaker 5>US Treasury Secretary Steven mentioned</v>

179
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:37.750
<v Speaker 1>in fact one of his own personal </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistance,</v>

180
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:38.584
<v Speaker 1>at least me Salazar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fled Venezuela in 2014 with the help of </v>

181
00:09:41.551 --> 00:09:42.384
<v Speaker 1>the dea and his statement couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more forceful in addition to providing </v>

182
00:09:45.391 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>evidence on the organization's </v>
<v Speaker 1>operation.</v>

183
00:09:47.460 --> 00:09:48.293
<v Speaker 1>He stated the mystic Dubay presidents of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the National Constituent Assembly gives </v>

184
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:52.344
<v Speaker 1>direct orders on the rips and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>departure of boats loaded with </v>

185
00:09:55.621 --> 00:09:58.320
<v Speaker 1>prohibited substances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's not the only one.</v>

186
00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Testimonies are accumulating in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>officers of the DEA,</v>

187
00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:03.840
<v Speaker 1>for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those will lead Mac lead statements from</v>

188
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.260
<v Speaker 1>when he was arrested in Columbia in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2011.</v>

189
00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:11.580
<v Speaker 1>Mccullough was one of the most powerful </v>
<v Speaker 1>drug traffickers in Venezuela,</v>

190
00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:13.740
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you controlled Puerto Cabezas,</v>

191
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:14.633
<v Speaker 1>which according to the dea was the exit </v>
<v Speaker 1>point for most of the narcotics </v>

192
00:10:17.161 --> 00:10:19.560
<v Speaker 1>distributed from the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

193
00:10:19.561 --> 00:10:20.394
<v Speaker 1>after his arrest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had declared with great detail that </v>

194
00:10:22.171 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 1>he had done business with several dozens</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Venezuelan generals,</v>

195
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:28.070
<v Speaker 1>high level government officials such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Rangel Silva,</v>

196
00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:31.320
<v Speaker 1>who was later named minister of Defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Hugo Carvajal,</v>

197
00:10:31.321 --> 00:10:35.190
<v Speaker 1>former army intelligence director who </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposedly paid him $50,000 a week,</v>

198
00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:39.240
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly a nice salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also claims to a financed one of Hugo</v>

199
00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Chavez campaigns in exchange for </v>
<v Speaker 1>concessions in Puerto Conveyor.</v>

200
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.623
<v Speaker 1>With all these relationships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to understand how in November </v>

201
00:10:47.701 --> 00:10:48.534
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a friend and tune your Campo Flores and </v>

202
00:10:50.641 --> 00:10:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Flores to freight us to have </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan first ladies,</v>

203
00:10:54.031 --> 00:10:54.864
<v Speaker 1>nephews were convicted in a New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>court conspiring to traffic hundreds of </v>

204
00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.530
<v Speaker 1>kilos of narcotics and folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to current estimates,</v>

205
00:11:01.531 --> 00:11:05.700
<v Speaker 1>the business in Venezuela at wingstop </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing between 15 and 20 percent of all</v>

206
00:11:05.701 --> 00:11:09.240
<v Speaker 1>the cocaine that moves in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year passes through this country.</v>

207
00:11:09.330 --> 00:11:11.730
<v Speaker 1>And not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as apparently the number of laboratories</v>

208
00:11:11.731 --> 00:11:15.210
<v Speaker 1>is also raising a great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

209
00:11:15.211 --> 00:11:16.044
<v Speaker 1>the giants of the Bolivarian Revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The money to keep the structures of </v>

210
00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.180
<v Speaker 1>repression loyal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the army,</v>

211
00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:24.210
<v Speaker 1>the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national guard or so in exchange for</v>

212
00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.073
<v Speaker 1>working in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different criminal groups based </v>

213
00:11:26.581 --> 00:11:27.414
<v Speaker 1>there from the mafia to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>paramilitaries and the Colombian </v>

214
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:33.720
<v Speaker 1>gorillas support the regime and since </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's good business,</v>

215
00:11:33.721 --> 00:11:36.390
<v Speaker 1>Maduro and company are still filling </v>
<v Speaker 1>that pockets.</v>

216
00:11:36.450 --> 00:11:37.283
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of all of this are </v>

217
00:11:38.881 --> 00:11:43.881
<v Speaker 1>terrible for one looting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All public resources has led the country</v>

218
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:47.790
<v Speaker 1>to ruin ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>

219
00:11:47.791 --> 00:11:49.920
<v Speaker 1>it's fueling an enormous amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

220
00:11:49.990 --> 00:11:50.823
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to data from the Venezuelan </v>

221
00:11:51.961 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 1>violence observatory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

222
00:11:54.221 --> 00:11:55.054
<v Speaker 1>there were 89 homicides per 100,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants in the country that is more </v>

223
00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:02.250
<v Speaker 1>than 26,000 people who lost their lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>violently.</v>

224
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.350
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

225
00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:12.750
<v Speaker 1>twitter has become the most dangerous </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in all of Latin America.</v>

226
00:12:12.751 --> 00:12:16.020
<v Speaker 1>And the situation in some areas like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caracas is even worse.</v>

227
00:12:16.050 --> 00:12:16.883
<v Speaker 1>The country's homicide rate skyrocketed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2017 to 130 people 100,000 </v>

228
00:12:21.841 --> 00:12:22.950
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

229
00:12:22.951 --> 00:12:23.784
<v Speaker 1>members of the government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll taking advantage of the situation </v>

230
00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.483
<v Speaker 1>and developing fortunes which they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>using to buy properties all over the </v>

231
00:12:29.191 --> 00:12:31.800
<v Speaker 1>world from the Dominican Republic to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Madrid.</v>

232
00:12:31.890 --> 00:12:32.723
<v Speaker 1>Indeed Madrid is a city to which not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only thousands of Venezuelans fleeing </v>

233
00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:36.594
<v Speaker 1>the disaster are arriving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also many of the relatives of the </v>

234
