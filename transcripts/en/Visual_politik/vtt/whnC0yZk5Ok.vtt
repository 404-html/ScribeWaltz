1
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.600
<v Speaker 1>The word brexit has become a synonym for</v>
<v Speaker 1>apocalypse for most of media,</v>

2
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:12.493
<v Speaker 1>at least the media outside of the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are many things to be said about </v>

3
00:00:15.501 --> 00:00:16.334
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today we're going to focus on this </v>

4
00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.680
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs to move hundreds of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>staff out of London,</v>

5
00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.620
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the time we're making this video,</v>

6
00:00:27.621 --> 00:00:28.454
<v Speaker 1>20 banks have already announced that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they will move part of their staff out </v>

7
00:00:31.161 --> 00:00:31.994
<v Speaker 1>of the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most optimistic estimations claimed </v>

8
00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:34.604
<v Speaker 1>that the city of London might lose over </v>
<v Speaker 1>30,000 workers and the most pessimistic </v>

9
00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.220
<v Speaker 1>argue that this could be as high as </v>
<v Speaker 1>$200,000.</v>

10
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 1>But wait just a minute here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is this important?</v>

11
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been following visual politic </v>

12
00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:48.164
<v Speaker 1>for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know that London is the </v>

13
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:50.473
<v Speaker 1>global financial capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More specifically that global financial </v>

14
00:00:52.851 --> 00:00:56.720
<v Speaker 1>capital would be the city of London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as the square mile.</v>

15
00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:57.663
<v Speaker 1>Square mile is essentially a city inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of a city where most of the </v>

16
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:02.330
<v Speaker 1>international banks have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters.</v>

17
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even after Brexit,</v>

18
00:01:06.061 --> 00:01:06.894
<v Speaker 1>it is possible that London will keep it </v>
<v Speaker 1>sway on the markets in Asia and even </v>

19
00:01:09.961 --> 00:01:10.794
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but so far European business accounts </v>

20
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:17.160
<v Speaker 1>for 35 percent of the city's workloads </v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course leaving the European Union</v>

21
00:01:17.161 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>is going to have some consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While now you might be wondering,</v>

22
00:01:20.851 --> 00:01:22.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are these banks going to go?</v>

23
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Which city will be the new financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital after London?</v>

24
00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>often monster competition.</v>

25
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.630
<v Speaker 1>It does seem as if we do finally have</v>

26
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:29.723
<v Speaker 2>winner</v>

27
00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.730
<v Speaker 1>and other companies plan expansion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankfurt after brexit.</v>

28
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:37.803
<v Speaker 1>So far this is a Frankfurt is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the new financial powerhouse in </v>

29
00:01:40.631 --> 00:01:44.230
<v Speaker 1>Europe and perhaps one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important in the entire world,</v>

30
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 1>but what does Frankfurt's sap that other</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities like Madrid or Paris don't?</v>

31
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.770
<v Speaker 1>Well today we are going to answer this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

32
00:01:50.771 --> 00:01:53.050
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look back at the history.</v>

33
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.410
<v Speaker 3>Why are banks leaving the city?</v>

34
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.240
<v Speaker 1>The city of London is an area of about a</v>
<v Speaker 1>square mile.</v>

35
00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.390
<v Speaker 1>See where the name comes from,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is located inside broader London.</v>

36
00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.490
<v Speaker 1>They have their own laws.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have their own mayor.</v>

37
00:02:08.491 --> 00:02:10.350
<v Speaker 1>They even have their own police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Little bit</v>

38
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:13.130
<v Speaker 3>base is the home for the main </v>
<v Speaker 3>international banks.</v>

39
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.400
<v Speaker 3>Three hundred thousand people work here </v>
<v Speaker 3>and have this 300,000,</v>

40
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.263
<v Speaker 3>60,000 European immigrants who entered </v>
<v Speaker 3>the country thanks to being part of the </v>

41
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.460
<v Speaker 3>European Union</v>

42
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.680
<v Speaker 1>and okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>my countrymen,</v>

43
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.030
<v Speaker 1>I know where you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite being an EU country,</v>

44
00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:29.120
<v Speaker 1>the UK never was really insight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The free circulation area.</v>

45
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.270
<v Speaker 1>This means that theoretically the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British government could have closed the</v>

46
00:02:32.271 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>borders to all those immigrants sit </v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime they want it,</v>

47
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:35.563
<v Speaker 1>but in practice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European citizens we're getting in and </v>

48
00:02:37.281 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>out of the country as they pleased.</v>

49
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.823
<v Speaker 4>It's clear that EU migration to the UK </v>
<v Speaker 4>has increased significantly over the </v>

50
00:02:42.771 --> 00:02:45.350
<v Speaker 4>last two decades.</v>
<v Speaker 4>In Twenty 15,</v>

51
00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:47.930
<v Speaker 4>they were just over 3 million people </v>
<v Speaker 4>living in the UK.</v>

52
00:02:47.931 --> 00:02:48.764
<v Speaker 4>You were born in other EU countries and </v>
<v Speaker 4>increase of about one point 9 million </v>

53
00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:54.270
<v Speaker 4>since 2003.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Nevertheless,</v>

54
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>things they are getting exchanged for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the questions to the prime minister,</v>

55
00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:01.700
<v Speaker 1>he British Prime Minister,</v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative Theresa may hold,</v>

56
00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:02.940
<v Speaker 1>holds an extremely weak</v>

57
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.893
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>

58
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Speaker 1>This is despite the fact that she won </v>
<v Speaker 1>the general election in June,</v>

59
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.930
<v Speaker 1>she just lost a large number of seats in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parliament doing that.</v>

60
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.973
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even clear if she's going to </v>

61
00:03:14.671 --> 00:03:16.200
<v Speaker 1>finish that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

62
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:17.063
<v Speaker 1>people from in and out of their party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are pushing her to increase </v>

63
00:03:20.161 --> 00:03:21.420
<v Speaker 1>immigration controls.</v>

64
00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:22.383
<v Speaker 5>I've consistently said that the </v>
<v Speaker 5>referendum vote was a vote for us to </v>

65
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:26.314
<v Speaker 5>change that freedom of movement with a </v>
<v Speaker 5>vote for us to bring control into our </v>

66
00:03:29.171 --> 00:03:31.870
<v Speaker 5>immigration system for people coming </v>
<v Speaker 5>from the European Union.</v>

67
00:03:31.871 --> 00:03:33.820
<v Speaker 5>There's a variety of ways in which that </v>
<v Speaker 5>can be done.</v>

68
00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:36.470
<v Speaker 1>This would have a big impact in the city</v>
<v Speaker 1>of London.</v>

69
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.363
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bigger impacts than anywhere else in </v>

70
00:03:38.511 --> 00:03:40.580
<v Speaker 1>the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said in another video.</v>

71
00:03:40.581 --> 00:03:41.414
<v Speaker 1>Positive London success comes from their</v>
<v Speaker 1>ability to attract talent from all over </v>

72
00:03:44.961 --> 00:03:45.794
<v Speaker 1>the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the government closes its doors </v>

73
00:03:47.421 --> 00:03:48.254
<v Speaker 1>to foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those banks you hire immigrants will </v>

74
00:03:50.121 --> 00:03:53.810
<v Speaker 1>have it to significantly harder than </v>
<v Speaker 1>before and make no mistake.</v>

75
00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>This is not only due to brexit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

76
00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.163
<v Speaker 1>the anti immigrant sentiment in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been going well beyond the borders </v>

77
00:04:00.591 --> 00:04:01.640
<v Speaker 1>of the European Union.</v>

78
00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:06.250
<v Speaker 2>Theresa</v>

79
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.083
<v Speaker 1>may discharge companies 2000 pounds per </v>
<v Speaker 1>year for each non European Union worker </v>

80
00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:13.173
<v Speaker 1>they employ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but wasting it because there's still </v>

81
00:04:15.071 --> 00:04:15.940
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said,</v>

82
00:04:15.941 --> 00:04:16.774
<v Speaker 1>Theresa May and so Conservative Party </v>
<v Speaker 1>have lost a good share of the seats in </v>

83
00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.000
<v Speaker 1>parliament as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where did those seats go?</v>

84
00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to the Labor policy.</v>

85
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.543
<v Speaker 1>A policy leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jeremy Corbyn has declared war on the </v>

86
00:04:27.341 --> 00:04:32.341
<v Speaker 1>backs on his election manifesto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He already proposed things like this for</v>

87
00:04:35.261 --> 00:04:37.810
<v Speaker 1>cultural UK financial transaction tax</v>

88
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:41.503
<v Speaker 1>until now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tax was one of the biggest </v>

89
00:04:42.801 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 1>advantages that UK had over the EU.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might know,</v>

90
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.693
<v Speaker 1>Brussels has been for years debating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>possibility of having a financial </v>

91
00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:50.924
<v Speaker 1>transaction tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something bankers really don't </v>

92
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:57.890
<v Speaker 1>wants and no one really wants to pay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if the UK parliament ends up passing</v>

93
00:04:57.891 --> 00:04:58.724
<v Speaker 1>such a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of companies will be wondering if </v>

94
00:05:00.801 --> 00:05:02.810
<v Speaker 1>they still want to keep their offices in</v>
<v Speaker 1>London.</v>

95
00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.780
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the brexit negotiations ended up</v>

96
00:05:05.781 --> 00:05:06.614
<v Speaker 1>being great for the UK interests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ad is still becoming more and more </v>

97
00:05:09.921 --> 00:05:12.770
<v Speaker 1>poisonous for the UKS financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

98
00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:13.663
<v Speaker 1>and this explains why so many banks are </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to think about opening offices </v>

99
00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.420
<v Speaker 1>outside of the.</v>

100
00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:18.463
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

101
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.690
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is why are they </v>
<v Speaker 1>choosing Frankfurt?</v>

102
00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:23.783
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at that financial </v>

103
00:05:29.931 --> 00:05:30.764
<v Speaker 1>capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the very day after the brexit </v>

104
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:32.774
<v Speaker 1>referendum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the race to take over London as the </v>

105
00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:37.040
<v Speaker 1>global financial capital started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

106
00:05:37.041 --> 00:05:37.874
<v Speaker 1>in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the regional governments of Madrid </v>

107
00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.770
<v Speaker 1>launched their own advertising campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to attract bankers,</v>

108
00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:46.503
<v Speaker 1>even the Finance Minister Luis held </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal meetings with executives from </v>

109
00:05:49.691 --> 00:05:53.380
<v Speaker 1>jp Morgan and elsewhere to offer special</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax conditions in Paris.</v>

110
00:05:53.381 --> 00:05:56.890
<v Speaker 1>Emmanuel macron had already announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower taxes for banks in order to hinder</v>

111
00:05:56.891 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 1>them from London,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm sorry guys,</v>

112
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.570
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to beat the India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Frankly.</v>

113
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.600
<v Speaker 6>Standard Charter Plc,</v>

114
00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.410
<v Speaker 1>Nomura Holdings Inc and Di was </v>
<v Speaker 1>securities group Inc,</v>

115
00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:11.303
<v Speaker 1>have all picked Germany's financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital for their EU base to ensure </v>

116
00:06:15.031 --> 00:06:18.470
<v Speaker 1>continued access to the single market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you want to stay wealthy,</v>

117
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.170
<v Speaker 1>which would help us and fun food city </v>
<v Speaker 1>group,</v>

118
00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:26.250
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are </v>
<v Speaker 1>weighing a similar decision.</v>

119
00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:29.070
<v Speaker 1>But what's so special about this city?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:06:29.071 --> 00:06:29.851
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frank,</v>

121
00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:30.684
<v Speaker 1>that already has the headquarters of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>European Central Bank as well as other </v>

122
00:06:33.641 --> 00:06:34.474
<v Speaker 1>big banks like Deutsche Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that they already have the </v>

123
00:06:36.881 --> 00:06:37.714
<v Speaker 1>network effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We always mentioned here a visual </v>

124
00:06:39.011 --> 00:06:39.844
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have lots of other things like </v>

125
00:06:40.691 --> 00:06:41.800
<v Speaker 1>startups,</v>
<v Speaker 1>law firms,</v>

126
00:06:41.801 --> 00:06:45.250
<v Speaker 1>consultancy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. Besides frankfurt has many business</v>

127
00:06:45.251 --> 00:06:46.084
<v Speaker 1>schools with international prestige as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as the university under the second </v>

128
00:06:49.001 --> 00:06:49.834
<v Speaker 1>biggest airport in europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know have in front foot like a form </v>

129
00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:58.220
<v Speaker 1>that chinese companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have like 800 turkish companies,</v>

130
00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.773
<v Speaker 1>1000 companies from United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only the rate of the english companies </v>

131
00:07:04.751 --> 00:07:05.584
<v Speaker 1>is quite little.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this will change from my point of </v>

132
00:07:07.941 --> 00:07:10.340
<v Speaker 1>view automatically.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this was not enough,</v>

133
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.610
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of the german population </v>
<v Speaker 1>speak english fluently.</v>

134
00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:14.473
<v Speaker 1>This means those british banks can send </v>
<v Speaker 1>their managers to Frankfurt old </v>

135
00:07:16.881 --> 00:07:17.714
<v Speaker 1>international meetings and even hire </v>
<v Speaker 1>locals without having to worry about </v>

136
00:07:20.841 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think this is not important,</v>

137
00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.773
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to find the same setup </v>
<v Speaker 1>and France were only 39 percent of the </v>

138
00:07:27.621 --> 00:07:30.200
<v Speaker 1>population speaks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shakespeare's language,</v>

139
00:07:30.260 --> 00:07:31.093
<v Speaker 1>not to mention Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where this percentage is lower than 25 </v>

140
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:34.424
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

141
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a minute because there is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

142
00:07:38.610 --> 00:07:42.630
<v Speaker 1>as I said in a previous video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany is a d at centralized country.</v>

143
00:07:42.810 --> 00:07:46.770
<v Speaker 1>This means regional governments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade unions have way more autonomy here</v>

144
00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 1>than they have in any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to this political architecture,</v>

145
00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 1>the region of hessen where frankfurt is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Locators can offer things like this.</v>

146
00:07:57.450 --> 00:07:59.910
<v Speaker 3>Labor laws make it difficult to fire </v>
<v Speaker 3>people.</v>

147
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:00.893
<v Speaker 3>Frankfurt had initially proposed a </v>
<v Speaker 3>change in labor laws that would either </v>

148
00:08:04.411 --> 00:08:08.310
<v Speaker 3>exempt bankers or high income earners </v>
<v Speaker 3>more generally from the rules.</v>

149
00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's think about something else.</v>

150
00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.453
<v Speaker 1>If you have a bank guns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wants to set up your offices </v>

151
00:08:12.691 --> 00:08:15.060
<v Speaker 1>somewhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the first thing you will need?</v>

152
00:08:15.120 --> 00:08:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be a building.</v>

153
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:19.620
<v Speaker 1>You need a physical place where you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>put your offices.</v>

154
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.680
<v Speaker 1>Well in this regard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frankfurt is better suited than anywhere</v>

155
00:08:22.681 --> 00:08:24.100
<v Speaker 1>else you see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After world war two,</v>

156
00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.520
<v Speaker 1>frankfurt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was totally destroyed and they had to</v>

157
00:08:26.521 --> 00:08:29.250
<v Speaker 1>rebuild it almost nothing and other </v>
<v Speaker 1>german cities,</v>

158
00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.143
<v Speaker 1>urban laws for the building of </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyscrapers in order to maintain the </v>

159
00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:34.470
<v Speaker 1>uniform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more traditional skyline,</v>

160
00:08:34.471 --> 00:08:35.304
<v Speaker 1>but not in frankfurt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here you can make buildings as high as </v>

161
00:08:37.650 --> 00:08:38.483
<v Speaker 1>you want.</v>

162
00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.140
<v Speaker 1>This explains why despite a population </v>
<v Speaker 1>of less than 1 million inhabitants,</v>

163
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:50.020
<v Speaker 1>frankfurt looks like a big metropolis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

164
00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:53.110
<v Speaker 1>Germany asked one of the cheapest real </v>
<v Speaker 1>estate markets in all of europe.</v>

165
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:54.790
<v Speaker 1>Despite the high salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>houses,</v>

166
00:08:54.791 --> 00:08:55.624
<v Speaker 1>rents square meters are half the price </v>
<v Speaker 1>of paris and a fraction of the cost of </v>

167
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:03.741
<v Speaker 1>london.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

168
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But now I know what you're thinking.</v>

169
00:09:05.701 --> 00:09:06.720
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on simon.</v>

170
00:09:06.721 --> 00:09:09.450
<v Speaker 1>What about corporate taxes and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important thing of all.</v>

171
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.493
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Germany has a corporate tax that </v>

172
00:09:12.331 --> 00:09:15.120
<v Speaker 1>in some cases reaches 30 percent by </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison.</v>

173
00:09:15.121 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 1>The uk is at 20 and you're absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

174
00:09:17.401 --> 00:09:19.350
<v Speaker 1>but the devil here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's really in the details.</v>

175
00:09:19.530 --> 00:09:20.363
<v Speaker 1>Do you ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How I said the gemini is highly </v>

176
00:09:21.121 --> 00:09:21.960
<v Speaker 1>decentralized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>this applies to corporate tax to in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

178
00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:27.180
<v Speaker 1>corporate tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's divided into two parts and national</v>

179
00:09:27.181 --> 00:09:29.660
<v Speaker 1>and a regional one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the federal government's</v>

180
00:09:29.670 --> 00:09:32.870
<v Speaker 1>gets only 15 percent of the tax.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest depends on the</v>

181
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:33.753
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>

182
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:40.120
<v Speaker 1>This means technically the state of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hessen where frankfurt is really has the</v>

183
00:09:40.121 --> 00:09:44.920
<v Speaker 1>ability to reduce this tax a lot and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course doing this mice and more and more</v>

184
00:09:44.921 --> 00:09:47.980
<v Speaker 1>british bankers that I'm finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if none of this was enough of you,</v>

185
00:09:48.010 --> 00:09:52.150
<v Speaker 1>here comes the big finale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the financial transaction tax.</v>

186
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:53.620
<v Speaker 1>This was the tax bill you mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>

187
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:56.260
<v Speaker 1>That scares away so many bankers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That tax,</v>

188
00:09:56.261 --> 00:09:59.320
<v Speaker 1>at least in europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has about as many loopholes as possible.</v>

189
00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:02.620
<v Speaker 1>There are so many exceptions on this tax</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Even its biggest supporter,</v>

190
00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:03.503
<v Speaker 1>the german finance minister had this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say humanist swiss cheese needs more </v>

191
00:10:09.551 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 1>than holes or has to be something in </v>
<v Speaker 1>between them.</v>

192
00:10:12.130 --> 00:10:15.640
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise it's just a hole,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not a swiss cheese.</v>

193
00:10:15.910 --> 00:10:16.960
<v Speaker 1>Wolfgang schauble.</v>

194
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.953
<v Speaker 1>So now we have a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you are the manager of one of </v>

195
00:10:22.811 --> 00:10:24.730
<v Speaker 1>these london banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you do?</v>

196
00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:25.593
<v Speaker 1>Would you remain in london or perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>would you move your offices to </v>

197
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:28.091
<v Speaker 1>frankfurt?</v>
