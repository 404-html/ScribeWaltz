1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.030
<v Speaker 1>Why is Donald Trump's so interested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>punishing the Islamic Republic of Iran?</v>

2
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.400
<v Speaker 1>If you've seen the previous two videos </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this series,</v>

3
00:00:12.401 --> 00:00:15.400
<v Speaker 1>you might believe that he's interested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in raising all prices,</v>

4
00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.263
<v Speaker 1>helping us Saudi friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll just showing the European Union </v>

5
00:00:18.971 --> 00:00:23.971
<v Speaker 1>who's boss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But here's another hypothesis.</v>

6
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.083
<v Speaker 1>What if Donald Trump is actually going </v>
<v Speaker 1>after the end of authoritarian rule in </v>

7
00:00:30.331 --> 00:00:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not a stupid theory.</v>

8
00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Iran is that the edge of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapse and to government protests,</v>

9
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:36.954
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>frequented.</v>

10
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.090
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other countries in the regions in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>

11
00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.300
<v Speaker 1>Dunn's have a secular,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liberal and democratic.</v>

12
00:00:42.301 --> 00:00:43.134
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

13
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 2>This means</v>

14
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.620
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to wage real war to bring</v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy to this country choking regime</v>

15
00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:55.463
<v Speaker 1>financially,</v>

16
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:56.850
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:02.303
<v Speaker 1>it actually works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump could even be looking at a </v>

18
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:06.330
<v Speaker 1>Nobel peace prize.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

19
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.450
<v Speaker 1>it would make Obama look dumb and trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>would win the 20,</v>

20
00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:10.284
<v Speaker 1>20 election for sure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what if it doesn't turn out as well </v>

21
00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:15.450
<v Speaker 1>as he plans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the ayatollah's regime is not as</v>

22
00:01:15.451 --> 00:01:18.810
<v Speaker 1>weak as he thinks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can Trump win the bat?</v>

23
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's video.</v>

24
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:25.420
<v Speaker 1>It covers all of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran is the man.</v>

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>America loves to hate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

26
00:01:31.261 --> 00:01:32.094
<v Speaker 1>the White House claims that the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctions are not meant to topple the </v>

27
00:01:35.071 --> 00:01:37.350
<v Speaker 1>regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but is that really true?</v>

28
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.890
<v Speaker 1>House national security advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Bowlby says,</v>

29
00:01:46.891 --> 00:01:49.980
<v Speaker 1>the United States is not seeking to </v>
<v Speaker 1>topple Iran's government,</v>

30
00:01:49.981 --> 00:01:50.814
<v Speaker 1>but since Washington does want </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities in Tehran to change their </v>

31
00:01:53.791 --> 00:01:55.980
<v Speaker 1>behavior,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but truth is for decades,</v>

32
00:01:55.981 --> 00:02:00.210
<v Speaker 1>America has been trying to do everything</v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to curb the Iot has power.</v>

33
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.223
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever heard of Radio Free </v>

34
00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:03.840
<v Speaker 1>Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the Cold War,</v>

35
00:02:03.841 --> 00:02:07.980
<v Speaker 1>the American Congress created this radio</v>
<v Speaker 1>station to spread anticommunist messages</v>

36
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.010
<v Speaker 1>into the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today this radio is still exists.</v>

37
00:02:11.011 --> 00:02:15.060
<v Speaker 1>Indeed they have their offices very </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to where I am recording this video</v>

38
00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>in Prague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Czech Republic,</v>

39
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:17.453
<v Speaker 1>and guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This radio has a whole department just </v>

40
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:21.763
<v Speaker 1>defaulted to Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They broadcast and using the Farsi </v>

41
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:27.480
<v Speaker 1>language to spread anti ayatollah </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages in signing the contract.</v>

42
00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 2>Does</v>

43
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.193
<v Speaker 1>this mean this means that Washington is </v>
<v Speaker 1>most definitely interested in a regime </v>

44
00:02:37.021 --> 00:02:37.854
<v Speaker 1>change in Tehran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but once you get really badly is one </v>

45
00:02:39.721 --> 00:02:40.554
<v Speaker 1>thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's actually possible is quite </v>

46
00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:42.773
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question that might be in your </v>

47
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.724
<v Speaker 1>mind right now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Iran really that bad of a </v>

48
00:02:47.311 --> 00:02:48.270
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

49
00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.310
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got elections,</v>

50
00:02:50.311 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>they've got political parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

51
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.010
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes and no.</v>

52
00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.000
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true,</v>

53
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:57.873
<v Speaker 1>but Iranians can vote for the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the actual person in charge is the </v>

54
00:03:00.791 --> 00:03:01.624
<v Speaker 1>supreme leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ayatollah Khomeini for better </v>

55
00:03:06.831 --> 00:03:07.664
<v Speaker 1>understanding how many shoes is most of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ministers and has the ultimate word </v>

56
00:03:11.031 --> 00:03:13.910
<v Speaker 1>on international affairs and many of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

57
00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:18.810
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it goes without saying.</v>

58
00:03:18.811 --> 00:03:19.644
<v Speaker 1>The political dissidence I'll absolutely</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosecuted and often killed by the </v>

59
00:03:22.801 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

60
00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.950
<v Speaker 1>despite having some opposition </v>
<v Speaker 1>movements,</v>

61
00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.490
<v Speaker 1>there are almost no important leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

62
00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.563
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because they're all dead in </v>

63
00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.850
<v Speaker 1>prison or exiled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Know what happens with the pro system,</v>

64
00:03:35.851 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>but physical forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well rather than political parties,</v>

65
00:03:38.581 --> 00:03:38.870
<v Speaker 1>we should</v>

66
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.870
<v Speaker 3>talk about the different factions.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One Hand.</v>

67
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.700
<v Speaker 3>We have the so called hardliners,</v>
<v Speaker 3>hardliners,</v>

68
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.543
<v Speaker 3>support the system created by Khomeini </v>
<v Speaker 3>to the letter religious law and state </v>

69
00:03:53.501 --> 00:03:58.501
<v Speaker 3>led economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have the reformers want to change the</v>

70
00:04:00.101 --> 00:04:03.130
<v Speaker 3>regime from the inside.</v>
<v Speaker 3>As you can imagine,</v>

71
00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.520
<v Speaker 3>this faction is losing power nowadays.</v>

72
00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:09.150
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>

73
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.983
<v Speaker 3>we have the pragmatist,</v>
<v Speaker 3>who's most important representative </v>

74
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.910
<v Speaker 3>would be the current president,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Hassan Rouhani,</v>

75
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.923
<v Speaker 3>pragmatist lie,</v>
<v Speaker 3>somewhere in between the hardliners and </v>

76
00:04:18.271 --> 00:04:21.180
<v Speaker 3>the reformers.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They want some economic reforms,</v>

77
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:22.253
<v Speaker 3>better relations with the West,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also want to retain religious </v>

78
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:26.200
<v Speaker 3>control over the political system.</v>

79
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.333
<v Speaker 1>And here we have the second question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really possible for this whole </v>

80
00:04:30.551 --> 00:04:33.520
<v Speaker 1>political system to fall apart?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.850
<v Speaker 1>there is a chance you see when an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is doing well,</v>

82
00:04:36.851 --> 00:04:38.650
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to keep an authoritarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

83
00:04:38.651 --> 00:04:39.484
<v Speaker 1>Getting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many citizens are pretty much happy to </v>

84
00:04:40.301 --> 00:04:41.270
<v Speaker 1>say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

85
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>I'll trade a bit of freedom if I get </v>
<v Speaker 1>some welfare,</v>

86
00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.930
<v Speaker 1>but Iran has spent too much time without</v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare.</v>

87
00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:48.003
<v Speaker 1>Iranian currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There y'all is devaluing every single </v>

88
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.440
<v Speaker 1>day and this has led to a brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>

89
00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:54.393
<v Speaker 1>Some non official estimates claim that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran will have more than a hundred </v>

90
00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:58.773
<v Speaker 1>percent inflation rate this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that some prices change on a </v>

91
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.704
<v Speaker 1>daily basis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many foods like chicken are starting to </v>

92
00:05:04.571 --> 00:05:07.810
<v Speaker 1>become scarce and there are more and </v>
<v Speaker 1>more people living below the poverty.</v>

93
00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.910
<v Speaker 1>Even with the government privatizations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy is a mess.</v>

94
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.803
<v Speaker 1>We're already told you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you right here on visual politic at the </v>

95
00:05:19.041 --> 00:05:19.874
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 started with massive protests </v>

96
00:05:22.671 --> 00:05:24.200
<v Speaker 1>against the Rouhani,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

97
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>and many of those protesters were young </v>
<v Speaker 1>university students.</v>

98
00:05:27.311 --> 00:05:28.730
<v Speaker 1>He wanted a shift in the system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

99
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.550
<v Speaker 1>shifted to a system that's democratic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>secular,</v>

100
00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>and liberal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question that,</v>

101
00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.913
<v Speaker 1>the real question here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is all of this enough to cause regime </v>

102
00:05:37.311 --> 00:05:38.180
<v Speaker 1>change?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:38.181 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>

104
00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:42.140
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history</v>

105
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>taurine guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end.</v>

106
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:50.610
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 79,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamic revolution started in Iran.</v>

107
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.610
<v Speaker 1>The supreme leader back then was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ayatollah Khomeini,</v>

108
00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:54.473
<v Speaker 1>and he knew that the army might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transit anymore decades of saving the </v>

109
00:06:01.241 --> 00:06:02.074
<v Speaker 1>shower pleasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was hard for them to change their </v>

110
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:04.114
<v Speaker 1>loyalties overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why in order to avoid acute ta </v>

111
00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:08.500
<v Speaker 1>come and he created his own parallel </v>
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

112
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.680
<v Speaker 1>This is how the Islamic Revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guard was created.</v>

113
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.543
<v Speaker 1>It's a sort of modern day Praetorian God</v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to preserve the Islamic </v>

114
00:06:16.691 --> 00:06:18.430
<v Speaker 1>republican system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the beginning,</v>

115
00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>all of the members were volunteers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things changed in the eight.</v>

116
00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.170
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

117
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:27.960
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran started a war with Iraq and who did</v>

118
00:06:27.961 --> 00:06:29.580
<v Speaker 1>they send to the front?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

119
00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.700
<v Speaker 1>they sent these Praetorian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see why willing to do anything for their</v>

120
00:06:32.701 --> 00:06:37.701
<v Speaker 1>cause and do you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in times of warfare,</v>

121
00:06:40.131 --> 00:06:40.964
<v Speaker 1>there's always money for weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how the Islamic revolution </v>

122
00:06:44.661 --> 00:06:45.494
<v Speaker 1>regard gained a lot more influence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly anymore weaponry and </v>

123
00:06:48.291 --> 00:06:50.090
<v Speaker 1>experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the end of the Iran,</v>

124
00:06:50.091 --> 00:06:50.924
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this Praetorian God already had more </v>

125
00:06:52.371 --> 00:06:53.204
<v Speaker 1>than 130,000 soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>plus many other smaller cause that </v>

126
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.950
<v Speaker 1>dependence</v>

127
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:58.560
<v Speaker 2>them</v>

128
00:07:04.440 --> 00:07:05.273
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This revolution regard hasn't signed </v>

129
00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.403
<v Speaker 1>intelligence service parallel to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's Ministry of Intelligence </v>

130
00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:10.913
<v Speaker 1>and they can imprison people and </v>
<v Speaker 1>investigate them without us even </v>

131
00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.600
<v Speaker 1>reporting to the authorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

132
00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:18.480
<v Speaker 1>they are the cornerstone of the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution,</v>

133
00:07:18.481 --> 00:07:19.314
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do have this parallel system and </v>

134
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:23.490
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why are they important?</v>

135
00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.831
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is,</v>

136
00:07:30.831 --> 00:07:31.664
<v Speaker 1>as far as the economy goes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to create an alternative to </v>

137
00:07:33.771 --> 00:07:34.604
<v Speaker 1>the system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have an elite corp spying on any </v>

138
00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:37.903
<v Speaker 1>would be political activists and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really are talking about an elite </v>

139
00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:41.743
<v Speaker 1>core here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're perfectly trained for hybrid </v>

140
00:07:43.341 --> 00:07:44.174
<v Speaker 1>warfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They fought in many other wars such as </v>

141
00:07:45.981 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>in Syria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

142
00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:50.570
<v Speaker 1>and even in Afghanistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of the experts say that training</v>

143
00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:51.680
<v Speaker 1>as well as class.</v>

144
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.460
<v Speaker 1>You might be wondering.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

145
00:07:57.461 --> 00:07:58.294
<v Speaker 1>we talked about weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do they buy weapons if Iran is so </v>

146
00:08:00.581 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Speaker 1>isolated from the international market?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How on earth is that possible?</v>

147
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that for decades,</v>

148
00:08:05.441 --> 00:08:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Ron has had its own weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing industry.</v>

149
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:09.490
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had that right.</v>

150
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:10.593
<v Speaker 1>They use Chinese and Russian designs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the manufacturing is all done in </v>

151
00:08:12.941 --> 00:08:13.774
<v Speaker 1>Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now of course the question becomes </v>

152
00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:18.010
<v Speaker 1>will they be affected by these economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctions?</v>

153
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:19.000
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

154
00:08:19.001 --> 00:08:19.834
<v Speaker 1>if Iran has no money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's got to be able to buy bullets </v>

155
00:08:22.031 --> 00:08:23.200
<v Speaker 1>and weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

156
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:24.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are,</v>

157
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:26.500
<v Speaker 1>the reality is nothing</v>

158
00:08:35.330 --> 00:08:36.163
<v Speaker 1>external pressure and black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A foreign competitors will most likely </v>

159
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:43.400
<v Speaker 1>help the Irg see further consolidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's grip over Iran's economy.</v>

160
00:08:43.700 --> 00:08:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Ali Elforni,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arab Gulf states institute in Washington</v>

161
00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:48.523
<v Speaker 1>for better understanding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a big portion of Iran's economy is in </v>

162
00:08:51.141 --> 00:08:51.974
<v Speaker 1>the revolution regards hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They own many statement or police </v>

163
00:08:55.150 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>cleaning oil companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refineries and real estate firms.</v>

164
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.183
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>51 percent of Iran telecom belongs to </v>

165
00:09:01.231 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Add to this,</v>

166
00:09:02.101 --> 00:09:02.934
<v Speaker 1>the fact they pay almost no taxes and do</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have completely self sustainable </v>

167
00:09:05.881 --> 00:09:09.030
<v Speaker 1>economics with a parallel army that so </v>
<v Speaker 1>well maintained?</v>

168
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:11.820
<v Speaker 1>It's hard to have regime change well </v>
<v Speaker 1>bus,</v>

169
00:09:11.821 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>if you've thought this was the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>asset that the ayatollah does have,</v>

170
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:17.100
<v Speaker 1>well you'd be wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you're going to see why</v>

171
00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:25.430
<v Speaker 1>China comes to the rescue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've said this many times in this three</v>

172
00:09:25.431 --> 00:09:28.550
<v Speaker 1>video series,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China will keep buying oil from Iran.</v>

173
00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:29.473
<v Speaker 1>They just can't stop doing this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China needs a lot of oil and for years </v>

174
00:09:33.411 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Iran has been there six most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplier.</v>

175
00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:39.590
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about more than 800,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrels that come from Iran every single</v>

176
00:09:39.591 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With these numbers.</v>

177
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.770
<v Speaker 1>It's really hard to change providers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>

178
00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:43.191
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

179
00:09:43.191 --> 00:09:44.450
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably right now.</v>

180
00:09:44.451 --> 00:09:46.640
<v Speaker 1>You've probably seen those previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos and you're thinking,</v>

181
00:09:46.641 --> 00:09:47.474
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>America has got that secret weapon </v>

182
00:09:48.621 --> 00:09:51.290
<v Speaker 1>that's going to keep countries from </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying Iranian oil.</v>

183
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:58.490
<v Speaker 1>As we talked about in the last video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically no tanker can dock in a harbor</v>

184
00:09:58.491 --> 00:09:59.324
<v Speaker 1>if it's not covered by an insurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>company in most of the insurance </v>

185
00:10:01.221 --> 00:10:03.680
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well the European or American.</v>

186
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:04.753
<v Speaker 1>So now the question comes is how does </v>
<v Speaker 1>China buy oil from Iran with this </v>

187
00:10:08.391 --> 00:10:09.530
<v Speaker 1>problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

188
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.453
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

189
00:10:15.270 --> 00:10:16.103
<v Speaker 1>Elusive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's shifts to Iranian tankers to </v>

190
00:10:18.301 --> 00:10:21.570
<v Speaker 1>keep oil flowing a mid US sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

191
00:10:21.630 --> 00:10:23.730
<v Speaker 1>you have that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without insurance companies,</v>

192
00:10:23.731 --> 00:10:28.290
<v Speaker 1>Iran will take care of the transport and</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad all of the risk and this.</v>

193
00:10:28.291 --> 00:10:29.124
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty great for the people </v>

194
00:10:29.881 --> 00:10:32.670
<v Speaker 1>receiving the oil before that have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>worry about maintenance,</v>

195
00:10:32.671 --> 00:10:33.504
<v Speaker 1>but now they're on bays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They'd have to worry about a ship now </v>

196
00:10:35.681 --> 00:10:37.440
<v Speaker 1>reaching its destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry.</v>

197
00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:41.280
<v Speaker 1>Iran spaying ships things in the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See something terrible happens again,</v>

198
00:10:41.610 --> 00:10:44.640
<v Speaker 1>Iran pays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is still not the whole story.</v>

199
00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:45.633
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the rest of the world is going to </v>

200
00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:49.110
<v Speaker 1>stop investing in Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do we have left?</v>

201
00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:50.153
<v Speaker 1>Exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've just freed up space for China's </v>

202
00:10:51.811 --> 00:10:54.720
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hence news like this</v>

203
00:10:58.890 --> 00:10:59.723
<v Speaker 2>Chinese</v>

<v Speaker 1>from to invest $2,000,000,000 an oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>refinery in Iran.</v>

205
00:11:04.290 --> 00:11:05.370
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

206
00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:08.520
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is taking advantage of the void.</v>

207
00:11:08.580 --> 00:11:10.260
<v Speaker 1>Other companies have all act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Other European companies have nate,</v>

209
00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:14.830
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this type,</v>

210
00:11:14.831 --> 00:11:15.664
<v Speaker 1>all the French oil company in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they started building what was meant to </v>

211
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:22.830
<v Speaker 1>be the biggest gas field on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now with trump sanctions,</v>

212
00:11:22.831 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 1>chances are they're going to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>retard this projects.</v>

213
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:27.660
<v Speaker 1>Guests who's ready to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

214
00:11:28.020 --> 00:11:28.950
<v Speaker 1>that would be China</v>

215
00:11:31.730 --> 00:11:32.250
<v Speaker 2>this summer</v>

216
00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:33.083
<v Speaker 1>in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trend of development bank announced </v>

<v Speaker 2>Gotcha.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Might</v>

220
00:11:42.920 --> 00:11:47.270
<v Speaker 1>wonder in the grand scheme of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this a lot of money or not so much?</v>

221
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:48.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has already helped to start building </v>

222
00:11:50.091 --> 00:11:52.910
<v Speaker 1>five brand new hospitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then what about other companies?</v>

223
00:11:53.070 --> 00:11:53.903
<v Speaker 1>Really when I told you that Iran is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the biggest car manufacturers in the </v>

224
00:11:56.051 --> 00:11:56.830
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

225
00:11:56.830 --> 00:11:57.663
<v Speaker 1>one of the main brands there is cyber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've already signed a joint venture </v>

226
00:12:00.431 --> 00:12:02.560
<v Speaker 1>with another Chinese company called </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brilliance,</v>

227
00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:04.570
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just the beginning.</v>

228
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:07.810
<v Speaker 1>Was the most ambitious projects </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently going on from China?</v>

229
00:12:07.811 --> 00:12:08.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 1>That's the new Silk Road that shooting </v>
<v Speaker 1>pain wants to build.</v>

232
00:12:18.980 --> 00:12:19.813
<v Speaker 1>I's Iran as important belt and road pub.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far they've already started to </v>

233
00:12:23.391 --> 00:12:24.224
<v Speaker 1>renovate several railroads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is to connect the main Iranian </v>

234
00:12:27.411 --> 00:12:28.244
<v Speaker 1>cities with high speed train so that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can transport goods and now you </v>

<v Speaker 1>might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

236
00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:34.360
<v Speaker 1>why is it so important?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

237
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:36.890
<v Speaker 1>just have a look at this map and Milan.</v>

238
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:43.273
<v Speaker 1>Imagine a train full of mobile phones </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling from China going through </v>

239
00:12:45.531 --> 00:12:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Central Asia and then going from Iran to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey.</v>

240
00:12:48.150 --> 00:12:51.170
<v Speaker 1>It looks like the perfect group for </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to just sell mobile phones.</v>

241
00:12:51.171 --> 00:12:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Dr. Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

242
00:12:52.821 --> 00:12:54.430
<v Speaker 1>this is just one idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>

243
00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:57.410
<v Speaker 1>Chinese businesses are already facing </v>
<v Speaker 1>many issues in central Asia,</v>

244
00:12:57.411 --> 00:13:00.620
<v Speaker 1>but this is definitely a massive friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the video.</v>

245
00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.400
<v Speaker 1>The truth is China is starting to invest</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavily in Iran.</v>

246
00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.730
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean that Xi Jinping will save</v>
<v Speaker 1>arounds economy?</v>

247
00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:08.851
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nice,</v>

248
00:13:08.851 --> 00:13:12.140
<v Speaker 1>but will this be enough for the regime </v>
<v Speaker 1>to survive?</v>

249
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just maybe,</v>

250
00:13:14.450 --> 00:13:15.283
<v Speaker 1>and this explains why in recent years </v>
<v Speaker 1>the political relations between these </v>

251
00:13:17.781 --> 00:13:20.510
<v Speaker 1>two countries are becoming more and more</v>
<v Speaker 1>fluid.</v>

252
00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:29.330
<v Speaker 1>Ping Holtz talks with President Hassan </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rouhani of Iran.</v>

253
00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:30.253
<v Speaker 1>So now is your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you really think that trump's </v>

254
00:13:31.250 --> 00:13:34.040
<v Speaker 1>sanctions will help end the ayatollah's </v>
<v Speaker 1>regime?</v>
