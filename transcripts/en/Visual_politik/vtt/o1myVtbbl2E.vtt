00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.430
<v Speaker 1>We might not notice it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the weld is changing really,</v>

2
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.293
<v Speaker 1>really fun.</v>

<v Speaker 1>biotechnology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>robotics,</v>

5
00:00:21.691 --> 00:00:25.740
<v Speaker 1>nanotechnology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every day somewhere on some discovery is</v>

6
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:26.574
<v Speaker 1>being made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Discoveries that will make our lines </v>

7
00:00:27.781 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more comfortable and generally just much</v>

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.070
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could always say,</v>

9
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.030
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that we are on board or high speed train</v>

10
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.930
<v Speaker 1>bounds for the future.</v>

11
00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:36.883
<v Speaker 2>John,</v>

12
00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.870
<v Speaker 1>that already companies in existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

13
00:00:40.871 --> 00:00:43.870
<v Speaker 1>which look like they could have come </v>
<v Speaker 1>straight out of a science fiction movie.</v>

14
00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.960
<v Speaker 1>Would you like some examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then are you familiar with Oregon?</v>

15
00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Novo?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a truly incredible company.</v>

16
00:00:49.451 --> 00:00:53.620
<v Speaker 1>It's listed on the Nasdaq and did </v>
<v Speaker 1>business is no less than the bioprinting</v>

17
00:00:53.621 --> 00:00:54.454
<v Speaker 1>of tissues to implant into the human </v>
<v Speaker 1>body and thus eliminating the need for </v>

18
00:00:57.611 --> 00:01:00.760
<v Speaker 1>organ transplants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you imagine printing and liver.</v>

19
00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.120
<v Speaker 1>It's truly remarkable.</v>

20
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.143
<v Speaker 2>Stop.</v>

21
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.390
<v Speaker 1>What about the company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Modern meadow.</v>

22
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.323
<v Speaker 1>This startup's aim is to produce leather</v>
<v Speaker 1>and meet without having to kill any </v>

23
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:11.794
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They want to reduce that own stakes in </v>

24
00:01:13.461 --> 00:01:14.970
<v Speaker 1>the lab and then take them to the bowl.</v>

25
00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.843
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

26
00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.250
<v Speaker 1>The question is though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you eat it?</v>

27
00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:22.740
<v Speaker 1>So how about another example of a heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Illumina?</v>

28
00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.300
<v Speaker 1>It's the largest company dedicated to </v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA sequencing in the wealth among other</v>

29
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.173
<v Speaker 1>targets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are trying to detect cancer before </v>

30
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.000
<v Speaker 1>any of the symptoms appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost unbelievable,</v>

31
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.410
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

32
00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.243
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

33
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these are only three of hundreds of </v>

34
00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 1>companies which are literally building </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future today.</v>

35
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

36
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.090
<v Speaker 1>Organ Printing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>DNA sequencing,</v>

37
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:44.983
<v Speaker 1>that's not really the best part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best part is the end of poverty is </v>

38
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:49.244
<v Speaker 1>getting closer every day and the reality</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that it's already right around the </v>

39
00:01:52.341 --> 00:01:53.240
<v Speaker 1>corner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listen,</v>

40
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.600
<v Speaker 1>we're not just talking about extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty here on the contrary,</v>

41
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:57.463
<v Speaker 1>current realities like hunger or not </v>
<v Speaker 1>being able to eat meat or not having </v>

42
00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:04.190
<v Speaker 1>access to healthcare or even not being </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to go on holiday aren't going to be</v>

43
00:02:04.191 --> 00:02:06.800
<v Speaker 1>rare and very infrequent in the near </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

44
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:07.663
<v Speaker 1>And it's blowing near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We mean this is going to be a reality </v>

45
00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:14.681
<v Speaker 1>and probably just a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

46
00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.520
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now some of you must be thinking,</v>

47
00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.383
<v Speaker 1>Simon's finally lost it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all down here for visual politic </v>

48
00:02:21.791 --> 00:02:22.900
<v Speaker 1>from here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I haven't lost my mind.</v>

50
00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hit with all of you as witnesses.</v>

51
00:02:27.101 --> 00:02:29.170
<v Speaker 1>I am willing to bet you that's in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

52
00:02:29.171 --> 00:02:34.171
<v Speaker 1>we will experience the best period of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity in the history of mankind and</v>

53
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:36.430
<v Speaker 1>I'm certainly not the only one who </v>
<v Speaker 1>shares this opinion.</v>

54
00:02:36.431 --> 00:02:37.264
<v Speaker 1>Listen to what Warren Buffett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the investment genius has to say about </v>

55
00:02:39.731 --> 00:02:40.564
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

56
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.463
<v Speaker 3>or how about Barack Obama as well.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you had a choice of when to be born </v>

57
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.100
<v Speaker 3>and you didn't know ahead of time who </v>
<v Speaker 3>you were going to be,</v>

58
00:02:51.101 --> 00:02:55.090
<v Speaker 3>what nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 3>whether you were male or female,</v>

59
00:02:55.091 --> 00:02:55.924
<v Speaker 3>what religion,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but you said when in human history be </v>

60
00:02:59.201 --> 00:03:00.070
<v Speaker 3>the best time to</v>

61
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.903
<v Speaker 4>be born.</v>

62
00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.870
<v Speaker 1>The time would be now while I'm here to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tell you even more,</v>

63
00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:05.733
<v Speaker 1>this wave of prosperity will bring </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities we've never even thought </v>

64
00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:10.230
<v Speaker 1>of before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

65
00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.350
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But for the skeptics era,</v>

66
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:13.203
<v Speaker 1>the numbers.</v>

67
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.350
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

68
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:22.650
<v Speaker 1>Tonight at the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the end of 2016,</v>

69
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:23.513
<v Speaker 1>three point 2 billion people are already</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be in the middle class and two </v>

70
00:03:27.001 --> 00:03:27.834
<v Speaker 1>each year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 140 million people will make </v>

71
00:03:30.631 --> 00:03:35.520
<v Speaker 1>it into this select club.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is as if every year a group of people</v>

72
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:38.220
<v Speaker 1>the size of the population of Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

73
00:03:38.221 --> 00:03:42.060
<v Speaker 1>leaving poverty behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Notice that this process is accelerating</v>

74
00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:43.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's expected that by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20,</v>

75
00:03:43.801 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>that's just three years from the time of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video coming out,</v>

76
00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.010
<v Speaker 1>most of the world's population will </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to the middle class.</v>

77
00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.950
<v Speaker 1>This growth in the middle class will </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean that the poor will finally be in</v>

78
00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.013
<v Speaker 2>Rsa.</v>

79
00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.983
<v Speaker 1>Before I continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am sure you might be wondering how </v>

80
00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.130
<v Speaker 1>exactly do you define middle class?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since income levels vary from country to</v>

81
00:04:09.131 --> 00:04:10.750
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we talk about middle class,</v>

82
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:15.100
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about is people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>can afford to have a very diverse people</v>

83
00:04:15.101 --> 00:04:19.120
<v Speaker 1>who can face and cover unexpected </v>
<v Speaker 1>expenses as well as education and people</v>

84
00:04:19.121 --> 00:04:21.220
<v Speaker 1>who can buy an automobile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people,</v>

85
00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 1>they might not be rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they definitely are poor anymore and</v>

86
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:27.610
<v Speaker 1>this is a brand new thing in the history</v>
<v Speaker 1>of men</v>

87
00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:29.580
<v Speaker 2>pies.</v>

88
00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:35.740
<v Speaker 1>Now they have an idea of how things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>changing today.</v>

89
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at the historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective.</v>

90
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.600
<v Speaker 1>When the Polian was fighting everyone in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>

91
00:04:40.601 --> 00:04:43.510
<v Speaker 1>only 2 million people could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered middle class.</v>

92
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:46.780
<v Speaker 1>That is less than half of the population</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Singapore today.</v>

93
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:47.673
<v Speaker 1>A pretty tough situation for the vast </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of people who were living at </v>

94
00:04:50.291 --> 00:04:51.790
<v Speaker 1>that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well since then,</v>

95
00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>150 years have passed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't until the 19 seventies,</v>

96
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.990
<v Speaker 1>but the number of people in the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class passed the 1 billion people today.</v>

97
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>The number is about 3 billion by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>21 is expected to reach for Binyam ends.</v>

98
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>As I mentioned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the process.</v>

99
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:15.250
<v Speaker 1>It's getting faster and faster every </v>
<v Speaker 1>single day.</v>

100
00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.143
<v Speaker 1>And this nice middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are going to make an impressive </v>

101
00:05:18.431 --> 00:05:19.960
<v Speaker 1>entrance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>

102
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:24.720
<v Speaker 4>And as we have these billions of people </v>
<v Speaker 4>in lodging into a global middle class,</v>

103
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.420
<v Speaker 4>they need to be fed.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They need to be housed,</v>

104
00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.610
<v Speaker 4>they need power,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they need transport,</v>

105
00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:31.120
<v Speaker 4>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they want to,</v>

106
00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:32.543
<v Speaker 4>they want to travel and see the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So there are tremendous opportunities </v>

107
00:05:37.141 --> 00:05:40.830
<v Speaker 4>for an expansion of economic activity to</v>
<v Speaker 4>meet their needs.</v>

108
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.900
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

109
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:49.070
<v Speaker 1>versiti you're looking at right now is </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hanoi,</v>

110
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.963
<v Speaker 1>which is the capital of Vietnam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the country in the world where </v>

111
00:05:51.891 --> 00:05:52.724
<v Speaker 1>capitalism is actually most liked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's according to a recent study from </v>

112
00:05:55.611 --> 00:06:00.611
<v Speaker 1>the Pew Research Center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seems like we're in the west.</v>

113
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:02.870
<v Speaker 1>Might have some catching up to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

114
00:06:02.871 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>the majority of this new middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're coming from Asia,</v>

115
00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:15.143
<v Speaker 1>almost nine out of every 10 new people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They make it to the middle class and </v>

116
00:06:17.441 --> 00:06:18.274
<v Speaker 1>live in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The continent of the economic boons and </v>

117
00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:21.293
<v Speaker 1>the growing epicenter of power on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to take a look at </v>

118
00:06:23.881 --> 00:06:26.940
<v Speaker 1>countries like the Philippines or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand in just a few years.</v>

119
00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:27.774
<v Speaker 1>These countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle classes will be as big as those </v>

120
00:06:29.491 --> 00:06:31.110
<v Speaker 1>in the UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France and Italy.</v>

121
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:33.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will remain poorer countries,</v>

122
00:06:33.271 --> 00:06:36.330
<v Speaker 1>but the growth of the middle class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still very impressive.</v>

123
00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:39.270
<v Speaker 1>Bots do you want to know how things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really changing?</v>

124
00:06:39.510 --> 00:06:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is Jakarta.</v>

125
00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:50.893
<v Speaker 1>Well that means for the companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to get </v>

126
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 1>into later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but out of all these countries,</v>

127
00:06:54.411 --> 00:06:58.210
<v Speaker 1>one is making a particularly big </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference and that's China who's middle</v>

128
00:06:58.211 --> 00:07:03.050
<v Speaker 1>class has absolutely exploded according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to estimations by Mckinsey analysts.</v>

129
00:07:03.051 --> 00:07:05.720
<v Speaker 1>If in five years this isn't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the homes of people were to create,</v>

130
00:07:05.721 --> 00:07:08.370
<v Speaker 1>say the Chinese Republic of middle class</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

131
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:13.010
<v Speaker 1>this country would be the third most </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated country in the world.</v>

132
00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.330
<v Speaker 1>No bad a sorry if he wants to know what </v>
<v Speaker 1>these changes really mean.</v>

133
00:07:17.450 --> 00:07:21.470
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at Truong quizzing the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>populated city in China</v>

134
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.870
<v Speaker 1>because of the growth of the middle </v>
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>

135
00:07:30.871 --> 00:07:34.650
<v Speaker 1>These people now have money available to</v>
<v Speaker 1>buy all kinds of products,</v>

136
00:07:34.680 --> 00:07:38.250
<v Speaker 1>clothing and like tronics cars and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course travel,</v>

137
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.430
<v Speaker 1>and now you can probably understand why </v>
<v Speaker 1>the countries in Asia,</v>

138
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:42.413
<v Speaker 1>especially China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are so important for multinational </v>

139
00:07:45.061 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

140
00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:46.603
<v Speaker 5>Canada's largest online ride hailing </v>
<v Speaker 5>platform dd two things that it's </v>

141
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:50.464
<v Speaker 5>received.</v>
<v Speaker 5>One billion US dollars from us tech </v>

142
00:07:52.361 --> 00:07:53.800
<v Speaker 5>giants,</v>
<v Speaker 5>apple pay</v>

143
00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:54.763
<v Speaker 1>close attention to this data because </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably interesting if you're </v>

144
00:07:56.931 --> 00:08:00.290
<v Speaker 1>starting a business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that the spending growth</v>

145
00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:01.153
<v Speaker 1>of the Chinese in the next four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone will exceed what the British or </v>

146
00:08:04.221 --> 00:08:05.670
<v Speaker 1>German spent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

147
00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.513
<v Speaker 1>refute our visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends are the company you might want </v>

148
00:08:08.721 --> 00:08:09.554
<v Speaker 1>to think about investigating the Asian </v>
<v Speaker 1>market because many opportunities will </v>

149
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.090
<v Speaker 1>appear in the next few years.</v>

150
00:08:22.090 --> 00:08:22.750
<v Speaker 6>Consequences</v>

151
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:23.583
<v Speaker 1>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm just an opportunity to make money </v>

152
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:27.760
<v Speaker 1>and do more business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably the most important consequences</v>

153
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>of this middle class expansion is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we will live in a happier world.</v>

154
00:08:31.930 --> 00:08:32.763
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've probably heard the phrase money </v>

155
00:08:34.391 --> 00:08:35.680
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make you happy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:08:35.681 --> 00:08:37.690
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to recent research,</v>

157
00:08:37.691 --> 00:08:38.524
<v Speaker 1>this is not entirely true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2010 Angus Deaton and Daniel Conaman </v>

158
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.940
<v Speaker 1>booster winners of the Nobel Prize in </v>
<v Speaker 1>economics presented a paper which proved</v>

159
00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:46.803
<v Speaker 1>that up to the figure of $75,000 a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>happiness and income with very closely </v>

160
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:52.294
<v Speaker 1>related,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning more income equals more </v>

161
00:08:54.041 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>happiness up to $5,000 a year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

162
00:08:56.881 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 1>this makes sense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have more money.</v>

163
00:08:58.321 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>You don't have to worry about making it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the end of the month,</v>

164
00:09:00.541 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>paying your bills and not having enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to eat as well as not being able to take</v>

165
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>your family to the doctor and etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So according to thEse two academics,</v>

166
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:10.980
<v Speaker 1>the expansion of the middle class is </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading to a happier world.</v>

167
00:09:11.010 --> 00:09:13.020
<v Speaker 1>But wait just a minute because there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

168
00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:15.630
<v Speaker 1>More middle claSs means more educated </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

169
00:09:15.660 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>This means more researchers and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs,</v>

170
00:09:18.001 --> 00:09:19.770
<v Speaker 1>more ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more innovation.</v>

171
00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:20.633
<v Speaker 1>Man's therefore more progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well today in China that are more </v>

172
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>college students have any in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

173
00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.710
<v Speaker 1>Remember the companies that we saw at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of this video,</v>

174
00:09:28.711 --> 00:09:29.730
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soon enough,</v>

175
00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:32.250
<v Speaker 1>there are going to be plenty more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>those.</v>

176
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:37.080
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be wondering,</v>

177
00:09:37.110 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>is this all really is wonderful as we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>describing a visual politic?</v>

178
00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.950
<v Speaker 1>How come people such as Donald Trump and</v>
<v Speaker 1>le pen are so popular then?</v>

179
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:44.843
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this middle class boom is not happening </v>

180
00:09:46.741 --> 00:09:49.200
<v Speaker 1>in all parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore it's really important.</v>

181
00:09:49.201 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>We understand that if western economies </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't working perfectly,</v>

182
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:53.453
<v Speaker 1>are having problems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they should take responsibility for it </v>

183
00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.790
<v Speaker 1>and stop blaming it on other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are plenty of opportunities in the</v>

184
00:09:59.791 --> 00:10:03.630
<v Speaker 1>global economy and now is the time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>adapt and sees them,</v>

185
00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.030
<v Speaker 1>but now I can probably guess what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking is.</v>

186
00:10:06.031 --> 00:10:08.640
<v Speaker 1>All of this group really sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 1>ways.</v>

187
00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:09.503
<v Speaker 1>All of this progress and development </v>
<v Speaker 1>destroy the environment so cause other </v>

188
00:10:12.511 --> 00:10:13.650
<v Speaker 1>such problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:14.970
<v Speaker 1>that's not exactly clear.</v>

190
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:22.513
<v Speaker 1>It's true that in theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more middle class means more spending </v>

191
00:10:25.131 --> 00:10:28.610
<v Speaker 1>and therefore more consumerism and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on natural resources,</v>

192
00:10:28.630 --> 00:10:29.463
<v Speaker 1>etc. But that awesome things to consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>first more middle class also means more </v>

193
00:10:33.141 --> 00:10:37.040
<v Speaker 1>people in big cities and the consumerism</v>
<v Speaker 1>here is usually more sustainable.</v>

194
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:39.200
<v Speaker 1>Transport is the most evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Example,</v>

195
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.960
<v Speaker 1>my public transport is frequent in large</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities.</v>

196
00:10:41.961 --> 00:10:42.794
<v Speaker 1>It is rare in small places.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More middle class also means faster </v>

197
00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:46.874
<v Speaker 1>demographic transition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so more women's study and work and say </v>

198
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:53.150
<v Speaker 1>the population tends to shrink as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>and above all more middle class means,</v>

199
00:10:53.151 --> 00:10:56.540
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more ideas and more innovation and among</v>

200
00:10:56.541 --> 00:11:00.350
<v Speaker 1>these things are often ideas which allow</v>
<v Speaker 1>more sustainable consumerism.</v>

201
00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:04.340
<v Speaker 1>So however we want to approach this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation and although that is certainly</v>

202
00:11:04.341 --> 00:11:06.680
<v Speaker 1>a lot of room for advancement and </v>
<v Speaker 1>improvement,</v>

203
00:11:06.710 --> 00:11:07.543
<v Speaker 1>we think that this really is a time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history when we should all be feeling </v>

204
00:11:10.370 --> 00:11:11.203
<v Speaker 1>rather positive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's our opinion at visual </v>

205
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.641
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ams.</v>

206
00:11:13.641 --> 00:11:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Now we would like to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

207
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:17.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you Believe we are moving towards a </v>
<v Speaker 1>better world?</v>

208
00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:20.930
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that asia can be a land of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity for businesses?</v>
