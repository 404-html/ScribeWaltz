00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:09.983
<v Speaker 1>We may not talk much about Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that this country </v>

2
00:00:12.571 --> 00:00:17.571
<v Speaker 1>matters much more than you probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>think $250 million,</v>

3
00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.580
<v Speaker 1>half of them under the age of 30 make up</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>

4
00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>the most populous Muslim country on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

5
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>but Indonesia is also one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated countries in the wells.</v>

6
00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me to explain.</v>

7
00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.930
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia is a huge archipelago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consists of more than 17,000</v>

8
00:00:43.931 --> 00:00:46.720
<v Speaker 1>islands covering more than 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers.</v>

9
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:47.583
<v Speaker 1>That's 3000 miles from end to end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is approximately the distance from </v>

10
00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>London to Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Based on this alone,</v>

11
00:00:57.521 --> 00:01:00.640
<v Speaker 1>you can already imagine the enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>variety of ethnicities,</v>

12
00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.503
<v Speaker 1>cultures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and languages that have founded this </v>

13
00:01:02.771 --> 00:01:06.010
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also the huge social differences.</v>

14
00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:06.873
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while these citizens of Jakarta are </v>

15
00:01:08.441 --> 00:01:09.274
<v Speaker 1>almost addicted to twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fifth of the population doesn't even </v>

16
00:01:12.071 --> 00:01:13.570
<v Speaker 1>have access to electricity.</v>

17
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.513
<v Speaker 1>It didn't issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diversity is not just geographic and </v>

18
00:01:21.141 --> 00:01:21.974
<v Speaker 1>cultural.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Different groups are essentially living </v>

19
00:01:23.301 --> 00:01:26.090
<v Speaker 1>at different points in human history all</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the same time.</v>

20
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:26.983
<v Speaker 1>Traveling from Jakarta to the Maluku </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands can seem like going back in </v>

21
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:31.340
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elizabeth [inaudible],</v>

22
00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.330
<v Speaker 1>writer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalist,</v>

23
00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>and scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can imagine how difficult it can</v>

24
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>be to manage a country like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

25
00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.073
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama spent a good part of his </v>

26
00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.870
<v Speaker 1>childhood in that right bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His mother married an Indonesian citizen</v>

27
00:01:44.871 --> 00:01:48.410
<v Speaker 1>in 1965 and two years later they moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Jakarta.</v>

28
00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:52.280
<v Speaker 1>I feel great affection for the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>here and obviously I have a sister who's</v>

29
00:01:52.281 --> 00:01:53.114
<v Speaker 1>half Indonesian.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My mother lived and worked here for a </v>

30
00:01:54.621 --> 00:01:55.454
<v Speaker 1>long time and so the sights and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sounds and the memories and all fueled </v>

31
00:01:58.181 --> 00:01:59.720
<v Speaker 1>very familiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama.</v>

32
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.591
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

33
00:02:00.591 --> 00:02:02.240
<v Speaker 1>Now some of you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Simon,</v>

34
00:02:02.241 --> 00:02:04.060
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why should I care about Indonesia?</v>

35
00:02:04.061 --> 00:02:06.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's so special about this country?</v>

36
00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.370
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Miss Eight,</v>

37
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.243
<v Speaker 1>despite all of its difficulties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian economy has grown a lot </v>

38
00:02:14.691 --> 00:02:16.610
<v Speaker 1>in recent decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the viewer,</v>

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:17.473
<v Speaker 1>even though it may surprise us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia will soon become the largest </v>

40
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.710
<v Speaker 1>Muslim power on the planet and that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots and lots of social,</v>

41
00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.780
<v Speaker 1>political and economic implications.</v>

42
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>You can even notice how people have </v>
<v Speaker 2>changed their way of dressing.</v>

43
00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.160
<v Speaker 2>The average age is around 29 to 30 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

44
00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.640
<v Speaker 2>Those young people who have gone out </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the market who are better trained,</v>

45
00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.700
<v Speaker 2>create an urban middle class with a huge</v>
<v Speaker 2>dynamism,</v>

46
00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.980
<v Speaker 2>and this dynamism is what will change </v>
<v Speaker 2>this country.</v>

47
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.430
<v Speaker 2>Carlos gastone BBV,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a representative in Indonesia.</v>

48
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably already imagined why we</v>

49
00:02:47.631 --> 00:02:50.240
<v Speaker 1>should care more about Indonesia than we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do,</v>

50
00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.760
<v Speaker 1>but before taking a closer look at </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's happening,</v>

51
00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.840
<v Speaker 1>he has a bit of history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Independence.</v>

52
00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.850
<v Speaker 1>Stevens in Asia has had two main </v>
<v Speaker 1>protagonists and Suharto.</v>

53
00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:13.920
<v Speaker 1>You see Indonesia is actually a fairly </v>
<v Speaker 1>new country.</v>

54
00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't until 1999 that it gained its </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence from the Netherlands.</v>

55
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.583
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

56
00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had that right.</v>

57
00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.200
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia wasn't a British or French </v>
<v Speaker 1>colony.</v>

58
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.063
<v Speaker 1>It was a Dutch colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and don't think that gaining their </v>

59
00:03:27.081 --> 00:03:29.180
<v Speaker 1>independence was easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

60
00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.133
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sukarno was an important leader of the </v>

61
00:03:32.181 --> 00:03:35.240
<v Speaker 1>resistance against colonial rule.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1927,</v>

62
00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:38.930
<v Speaker 1>he founded the Indonesian Nationalist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party under this slogan,</v>

63
00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.490
<v Speaker 1>one nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>

64
00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.850
<v Speaker 1>one people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Indonesian one language Bahasa,</v>

65
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:46.350
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mike.</v>

66
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.443
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

67
00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.060
<v Speaker 1>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

68
00:03:54.061 --> 00:03:57.300
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch authorities didn't like these </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas at all,</v>

69
00:03:57.301 --> 00:03:59.790
<v Speaker 1>so Sukarno was persecuted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>detained,</v>

70
00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.120
<v Speaker 1>and finally forced into a kind of exile </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Sumatra.</v>

71
00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.870
<v Speaker 3>Hey,</v>

72
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 1>imprisonment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>

73
00:04:05.981 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>which saw him released in weld water.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You Buy Japanese troops.</v>

74
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:09.904
<v Speaker 1>When they occupied Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Japanese themselves joins the </v>

75
00:04:12.311 --> 00:04:15.010
<v Speaker 1>Indonesian nationalists to control the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country</v>

76
00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:16.313
<v Speaker 3>easily.</v>

77
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:24.240
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that two days off to Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>surrendered in August of 1945,</v>

78
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.103
<v Speaker 1>it's economy declined.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia's independence a declaration </v>

79
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.640
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't recognized by the Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities indeed far from that,</v>

80
00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:32.483
<v Speaker 1>so they tried to regain power by force </v>
<v Speaker 1>began the Socorro's national revolution </v>

81
00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:39.710
<v Speaker 1>that lasted for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>

82
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.553
<v Speaker 1>which was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bloody after the birth of the </v>

83
00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.383
<v Speaker 1>Republican Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we experienced a painful separation </v>

84
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.310
<v Speaker 1>process marked by terrible violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are dark pages of art history,</v>

85
00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>burt calendars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dutch,</v>

86
00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.300
<v Speaker 1>former minister of foreign affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea,</v>

87
00:04:54.301 --> 00:04:57.840
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that in just four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 100,000</v>

88
00:04:57.841 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>Indonesians and 5,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers lost their lives.</v>

89
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:02.423
<v Speaker 1>And that is how finally in 1949,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after much much suffering reduction </v>

90
00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.380
<v Speaker 1>authorities excepted underrecognized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia's independent.</v>

91
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.390
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dictators,</v>

92
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:21.253
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieving independent certainly didn't </v>

93
00:05:22.851 --> 00:05:24.980
<v Speaker 1>mean that the country was free over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>following.</v>

94
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economy led Indonesia in an increasingly</v>

95
00:05:28.191 --> 00:05:32.900
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian way under a model that </v>
<v Speaker 1>became known as directed democracy,</v>

96
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:33.793
<v Speaker 1>and I swear every time you put an </v>
<v Speaker 1>adjective next to the term democracy </v>

97
00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:40.220
<v Speaker 1>usually beads that something is anything</v>
<v Speaker 1>but democratic.</v>

98
00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:42.920
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of problems occurred,</v>

99
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.850
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was really,</v>

100
00:05:43.851 --> 00:05:44.684
<v Speaker 1>really poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy didn't work and there were </v>

101
00:05:46.221 --> 00:05:50.180
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of rebellions and conflicts as</v>
<v Speaker 1>ethnic conflict,</v>

102
00:05:50.181 --> 00:05:51.014
<v Speaker 1>self-determination,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a conflict with Malaysia and especially </v>

103
00:05:53.211 --> 00:05:54.044
<v Speaker 1>with the Indonesian Communist Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first Communist Party and Asia by the </v>

104
00:05:56.841 --> 00:05:57.674
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which with China and the Soviet Union </v>

105
00:05:59.001 --> 00:06:02.050
<v Speaker 1>supports became increasingly important </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the car.</v>

106
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.983
<v Speaker 4>True.</v>

107
00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:06.053
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Staccato wasn't considered a communist </v>

108
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:09.800
<v Speaker 1>leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was a rather socialist.</v>

109
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:10.634
<v Speaker 1>Nita who didn't mind getting close to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mao's China and even received support </v>

110
00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.253
<v Speaker 1>from the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was something that didn't prevent </v>

111
00:06:17.031 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian communist party from </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to seize power at all costs.</v>

112
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.323
<v Speaker 4>Right</v>

113
00:06:24.290 --> 00:06:26.660
<v Speaker 1>between all of this pushing and shoving </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 19,</v>

114
00:06:26.661 --> 00:06:29.210
<v Speaker 1>65 and important happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>call me.</v>

115
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>C'Mon disconnected to the Communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party.</v>

116
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.590
<v Speaker 1>Prepared a who were interested in why.</v>

117
00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:35.150
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

118
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:38.693
<v Speaker 1>this events unleashed a brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression against the communist party </v>

119
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.833
<v Speaker 1>that cost the lives of hundreds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people and which the army </v>

120
00:06:46.231 --> 00:06:47.064
<v Speaker 1>general Suharto greatly took advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of to seize power with support from the </v>

121
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.720
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the following three decades.</v>

122
00:06:56.911 --> 00:06:59.730
<v Speaker 1>The hotter ruled the country with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>iron fist.</v>

123
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:00.593
<v Speaker 1>With Washington support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he launched some economic expansion </v>

124
00:07:02.851 --> 00:07:07.050
<v Speaker 1>measures that were quite successful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made their growth skyrockets.</v>

125
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:09.173
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was still a harsh dictatorship and </v>

126
00:07:11.251 --> 00:07:14.430
<v Speaker 1>the state's violence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political repression and corruption were</v>

127
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.490
<v Speaker 1>tremendously widespread.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when at the end of the nineties,</v>

128
00:07:17.491 --> 00:07:20.160
<v Speaker 1>the Asian crisis occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian economy will,</v>

129
00:07:20.161 --> 00:07:20.994
<v Speaker 1>it collapsed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The repeat lost 80 percent of its value </v>

130
00:07:22.861 --> 00:07:25.530
<v Speaker 1>against the dollar and poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplied by four.</v>

131
00:07:29.090 --> 00:07:31.370
<v Speaker 1>Faced with this disaster general </v>
<v Speaker 1>Suharto,</v>

132
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:32.443
<v Speaker 1>he was forced to leave after almost 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of independence and dictatorship </v>

133
00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:40.940
<v Speaker 1>democracy in Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally had a chance and finally,</v>

134
00:07:40.941 --> 00:07:44.160
<v Speaker 1>after a lot of conflicts because in this</v>
<v Speaker 1>country conflicts that constants,</v>

135
00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:47.180
<v Speaker 1>the first free elections were held in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2004.</v>

136
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.011
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it must be said,</v>

137
00:07:49.011 --> 00:07:49.844
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that since the hottest Indonesia has </v>

138
00:07:51.411 --> 00:07:54.200
<v Speaker 1>experienced a period of change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political openness,</v>

139
00:07:54.201 --> 00:07:58.160
<v Speaker 1>de-centralization as an economic policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is more open to the wells,</v>

140
00:07:58.190 --> 00:07:59.023
<v Speaker 1>but even with all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is still very highly restricted band </v>

141
00:08:04.110 --> 00:08:04.943
<v Speaker 1>in 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia's current President Joko </v>

142
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:08.263
<v Speaker 1>Widodo popularly known as [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>and usually qualified as the Indonesian </v>

143
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:16.181
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama won the elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can we promise to liberalize the country</v>

144
00:08:19.940 --> 00:08:24.290
<v Speaker 1>boost growth over seven percent per year</v>
<v Speaker 1>and lay the foundations for Indonesia to</v>

145
00:08:24.291 --> 00:08:25.124
<v Speaker 1>become an economic and political power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed the largest Muslim power in the </v>

146
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:33.790
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That moments,</v>

147
00:08:33.791 --> 00:08:34.624
<v Speaker 1>my friends expectations west </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketing the international media </v>

148
00:08:37.901 --> 00:08:40.870
<v Speaker 1>spoke of Indonesia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has the country of the few chat bots.</v>

149
00:08:40.871 --> 00:08:45.871
<v Speaker 1>Wait just a minute because since then </v>
<v Speaker 1>some things changed so</v>

150
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:47.433
<v Speaker 3>enough.</v>

151
00:08:52.020 --> 00:08:52.853
<v Speaker 1>Go Widodo President.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between two worlds we know there's a </v>

152
00:08:58.341 --> 00:09:01.520
<v Speaker 1>rival was a great revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great breath of fresh air,</v>

153
00:09:01.521 --> 00:09:02.540
<v Speaker 1>if you will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>draw a week,</v>

154
00:09:02.541 --> 00:09:03.374
<v Speaker 1>was the first non military or political </v>
<v Speaker 1>elites does in the country to take </v>

155
00:09:06.830 --> 00:09:09.050
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Social networks such as facebook,</v>

156
00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:09.913
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and youtube played an absolutely key </v>

157
00:09:11.541 --> 00:09:12.374
<v Speaker 1>role and the truth is that the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>president started off his to make </v>

158
00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:19.880
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia become a much more competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>country on the right foot.</v>

159
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:24.000
<v Speaker 1>See arrived in power among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures.</v>

160
00:09:24.001 --> 00:09:25.410
<v Speaker 1>Joker,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we greatly decrease.</v>

161
00:09:25.411 --> 00:09:26.244
<v Speaker 1>Stands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eliminated several subsidies and </v>

162
00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>allocated that money about $40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars by the way,</v>

163
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.660
<v Speaker 1>to try and solve one of the country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest problems.</v>

164
00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:35.130
<v Speaker 1>Then lack of infrastructure.</v>

165
00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:36.013
<v Speaker 3>Sure,</v>

166
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.233
<v Speaker 1>something that makes transporting goods </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the countries islands even more </v>

167
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:47.360
<v Speaker 1>expensive than importing a container </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Europe and not only that,</v>

168
00:09:47.361 --> 00:09:48.194
<v Speaker 1>the president has also launched several </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs to decrease bureaucracy and </v>

169
00:09:51.651 --> 00:09:52.484
<v Speaker 1>regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is another pretty big problem in </v>

170
00:09:54.831 --> 00:09:59.831
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me give you an example.</v>

171
00:10:00.561 --> 00:10:01.370
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>

172
00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:04.560
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia's regulations and </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracies are so strong that the.</v>

173
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:06.270
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if companies like Intertek,</v>

174
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.740
<v Speaker 1>Zara or h and m wants to open a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>store in Jakarta,</v>

175
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:13.370
<v Speaker 1>they can't do it directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need a local franchise.</v>

176
00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:14.550
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

177
00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:18.203
<v Speaker 1>it's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many sectors are simply closed to </v>

178
00:10:19.671 --> 00:10:23.490
<v Speaker 1>foreign investments and the government </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to assume a large part of the weight</v>

179
00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:24.403
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Construction companies are a nautical </v>

180
00:10:25.520 --> 00:10:26.353
<v Speaker 1>industries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shipyards and many communication </v>

181
00:10:28.381 --> 00:10:31.470
<v Speaker 1>companies are still all state owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

182
00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.473
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

183
00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:35.733
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The joker is also promoting opening </v>

184
00:10:37.810 --> 00:10:38.643
<v Speaker 1>special economic tourism and industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas and just launched a medical </v>

185
00:10:41.831 --> 00:10:45.340
<v Speaker 1>insurance model that has covered more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than half of the population,</v>

186
00:10:52.340 --> 00:10:55.290
<v Speaker 1>so right now I imagine it's all sounding</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty darn good too.</v>

187
00:10:55.291 --> 00:10:59.670
<v Speaker 1>You Weld if you just hold on a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because despite everything,</v>

188
00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:00.533
<v Speaker 1>these changes are slower than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president promised and slower than they </v>

189
00:11:03.571 --> 00:11:06.180
<v Speaker 1>need to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

190
00:11:06.181 --> 00:11:07.730
<v Speaker 1>even though foreign investment has </v>
<v Speaker 1>grown,</v>

191
00:11:07.740 --> 00:11:10.400
<v Speaker 1>the growth rate is much lower than </v>
<v Speaker 1>expected.</v>

192
00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:15.030
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the biggest problem,</v>

193
00:11:15.031 --> 00:11:17.310
<v Speaker 1>nor what will probably cost this </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

194
00:11:17.311 --> 00:11:18.640
<v Speaker 1>his reelection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh No.</v>

195
00:11:18.810 --> 00:11:19.643
<v Speaker 1>The big problem is that in recent years </v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been outbreaks of religious </v>

196
00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:28.190
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>moderate Islamic power.</v>

197
00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:35.990
<v Speaker 3>He is.</v>

198
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:40.180
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia has been presented as a kind </v>
<v Speaker 1>of model like mostly Muslim country that</v>

199
00:11:40.190 --> 00:11:41.023
<v Speaker 1>recognize this religious freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country that is becoming increasingly </v>

200
00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.930
<v Speaker 1>open to the world as where women </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate actively in political life.</v>

201
00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:50.960
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia tradition of moderate Islam </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankly,</v>

202
00:11:50.961 --> 00:11:55.190
<v Speaker 1>is an inspiration to the world and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>you and your people in your nation.</v>

203
00:11:55.191 --> 00:11:57.220
<v Speaker 1>As in mind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>religion unifies it,</v>

204
00:11:57.221 --> 00:11:59.440
<v Speaker 1>does not divide Mike Pence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>

205
00:11:59.441 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

206
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.534
<v Speaker 1>this is how the Indonesian government </v>
<v Speaker 1>presents itself to the rest of the </v>

207
00:12:03.731 --> 00:12:04.564
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia is the world's third largest </v>

208
00:12:06.491 --> 00:12:07.324
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we also have the world's largest </v>

209
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:09.634
<v Speaker 1>Muslim population is demonstrates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and Islam are not </v>

210
00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:14.110
<v Speaker 1>incompatible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joko Widodo,</v>

211
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:16.150
<v Speaker 1>president of Indonesia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

212
00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.013
<v Speaker 1>in recent years there has been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant increase in religious </v>

213
00:12:19.901 --> 00:12:20.734
<v Speaker 1>radicalism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that organizations </v>

214
00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:26.050
<v Speaker 1>like Amnesty International and Human </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rights Watch are denouncing,</v>

215
00:12:26.080 --> 00:12:29.460
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that they have every </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to do so.</v>

216
00:12:31.670 --> 00:12:32.810
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

217
00:12:32.811 --> 00:12:33.644
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian Leymah Council,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest religious authority in the </v>

218
00:12:36.171 --> 00:12:37.004
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to defend the belief that </v>

219
00:12:38.421 --> 00:12:39.254
<v Speaker 1>Christians and other nonbelievers </v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't be able to hold political </v>

220
00:12:41.751 --> 00:12:44.480
<v Speaker 1>positions in areas that were majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim,</v>

221
00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:47.720
<v Speaker 1>which does pertain to the vast majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the country.</v>

222
00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:50.653
<v Speaker 1>Only other hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The governor of Jakarta and close ally </v>

223
00:12:53.331 --> 00:12:56.270
<v Speaker 1>of President Jokowi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Christian of Chinese ancestry,</v>

224
00:12:56.271 --> 00:12:57.104
<v Speaker 1>known as a hawk has been condemned for </v>
<v Speaker 1>blast from eight by insinuating that </v>

225
00:13:00.171 --> 00:13:02.190
<v Speaker 1>politics and religion should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate.</v>

226
00:13:02.310 --> 00:13:03.143
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

227
00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:05.063
<v Speaker 1>Recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamist parties discourse has </v>

228
00:13:06.741 --> 00:13:09.110
<v Speaker 1>become a lot harsher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

229
00:13:09.111 --> 00:13:12.170
<v Speaker 1>in 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are proposing a change to the penal</v>

230
00:13:12.171 --> 00:13:13.004
<v Speaker 1>code to prosecute relations outside of </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage and between same sex couples </v>

231
00:13:16.610 --> 00:13:21.500
<v Speaker 1>more harshly and even make cohabitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of single couples illegal.</v>

232
00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:28.580
<v Speaker 1>See Right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia is still a relatively moderate</v>

233
00:13:28.581 --> 00:13:29.414
<v Speaker 1>country and most of its population </v>
<v Speaker 1>supports and open democracy and even </v>

234
00:13:32.720 --> 00:13:36.050
<v Speaker 1>religious freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but everything points to the probability</v>

235
00:13:36.051 --> 00:13:36.884
<v Speaker 1>that in the 2019 election,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamists will have a larger chance </v>

236
00:13:40.431 --> 00:13:41.264
<v Speaker 1>of winning and it's clear that we'll </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a future power that can </v>

237
00:13:43.311 --> 00:13:47.390
<v Speaker 1>give us many joys for many headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See if the current reforms continue.</v>

238
00:13:47.391 --> 00:13:50.210
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia will be a huge market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

239
00:13:50.211 --> 00:13:53.690
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated that by 2030,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indonesian middle class will consume</v>

240
00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:55.790
<v Speaker 1>much more than Germany's middle class,</v>

241
00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:01.303
<v Speaker 1>and if religious moderation winds its </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence in the Muslim world will be </v>

242
00:14:04.490 --> 00:14:05.780
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much stronger.</v>

243
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:09.380
<v Speaker 1>So we can only hope that Indonesia goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the right path,</v>

244
00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:10.273
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

245
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:14.660
<v Speaker 1>Indonesia's favoring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have a more moderate status?</v>
