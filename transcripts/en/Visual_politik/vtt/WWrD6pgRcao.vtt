1
00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.310
<v Speaker 1>Run out of these one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative companies on the planet,</v>

2
00:00:10.311 --> 00:00:13.110
<v Speaker 1>and yet it also manages to be one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most hated.</v>

3
00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:13.821
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

4
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:16.280
<v Speaker 1>We've all heard of companies like tesla </v>
<v Speaker 1>or hyperbole,</v>

5
00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:17.420
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's be honest,</v>

6
00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.170
<v Speaker 1>it's going to be years before those </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies actually change lives.</v>

7
00:00:21.171 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>If they ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear ron and I have created a revolution</v>

8
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.140
<v Speaker 1>or ready and I'm not worried about </v>
<v Speaker 1>European.</v>

9
00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:29.480
<v Speaker 1>Ron has sway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can be felt worldwide,</v>

10
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:30.493
<v Speaker 1>but on the other side of things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's hard to find someone who doesn't </v>

11
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.940
<v Speaker 1>hate this ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is partly due to the efforts of its</v>

12
00:00:34.941 --> 00:00:36.560
<v Speaker 1>CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael O'leary.</v>

13
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:37.513
<v Speaker 1>He seems to have worked really hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become the man you love to hate with </v>

14
00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.810
<v Speaker 1>quotes like this one,</v>

15
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.190
<v Speaker 2>but we need fewer people queuing to go </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the toilet.</v>

16
00:00:44.191 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 2>How do you get fewer people queuing to </v>
<v Speaker 2>go to the toilet,</v>

17
00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.290
<v Speaker 2>charge them for it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or how about this one?</v>

18
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's on board.</v>

19
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.343
<v Speaker 2>We have been frankly astonished at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>number of customers who don't only want </v>

20
00:00:57.541 --> 00:00:59.580
<v Speaker 2>to tax people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but torture them.</v>

21
00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.440
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually another reason people hate</v>

22
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.520
<v Speaker 1>ron already.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been following this channel,</v>

23
00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:04.354
<v Speaker 1>all my others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might already know that I live in </v>

24
00:01:05.621 --> 00:01:06.850
<v Speaker 1>Prague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Czech Republic.</v>

25
00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.380
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Paul is on this channel,</v>

26
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:11.440
<v Speaker 1>they live over in Madrid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spain and until there's a very month,</v>

27
00:01:11.441 --> 00:01:13.990
<v Speaker 1>the cost of a flight to go from here in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prague to Madrid,</v>

28
00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.620
<v Speaker 1>cost about 250 American dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this year,</v>

29
00:01:17.621 --> 00:01:20.950
<v Speaker 1>well Ryan and I came down and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to offer Prague to Madrid routes</v>

30
00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:21.784
<v Speaker 1>for about $90.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what did the other airlines do in </v>

31
00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:25.450
<v Speaker 1>response to this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:01:25.451 --> 00:01:26.284
<v Speaker 1>they were also forced to lower their </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices and this didn't just happen </v>

33
00:01:29.321 --> 00:01:32.290
<v Speaker 1>between Progam Madrid.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happened all across Europe.</v>

34
00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.500
<v Speaker 1>Anywhere Ryan out operates the rest of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's competitors.</v>

35
00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>Hats put down their prices in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remain competitive.</v>

36
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.890
<v Speaker 1>This meant lower profits or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential bankrupt.</v>

37
00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:42.743
<v Speaker 3>Let's see.</v>

38
00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Just to have a look at British Airways </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the year 2000,</v>

39
00:01:49.121 --> 00:01:49.954
<v Speaker 1>they carried over 46 million passengers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just eight years later they didn't </v>

40
00:01:52.961 --> 00:01:55.210
<v Speaker 1>even carry 33 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course,</v>

41
00:01:55.211 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>those big airlines like British Airways </v>
<v Speaker 1>or Lufthansa or Iberia,</v>

42
00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>they spent a fortune buying ads in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media and well,</v>

43
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.110
<v Speaker 1>because it was ad buy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want the love of journalists sand.</v>

44
00:02:05.111 --> 00:02:05.501
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

45
00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:07.350
<v Speaker 1>you didn't have much love from </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists.</v>

46
00:02:07.351 --> 00:02:10.720
<v Speaker 1>Well that would be ryanair because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>never really bought any apps.</v>

47
00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite this bad reputation,</v>

48
00:02:12.341 --> 00:02:16.540
<v Speaker 1>there are only a few companies that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>claim to have changed an entire industry</v>

49
00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.360
<v Speaker 1>the way that Ryan did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as I said before,</v>

50
00:02:19.361 --> 00:02:20.194
<v Speaker 1>this is not only a European thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan air effects can be felt around the </v>

51
00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:26.410
<v Speaker 1>wells except perhaps in Latin America.</v>

52
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:33.840
<v Speaker 1>So the first question we have to ask </v>
<v Speaker 1>here is,</v>

53
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.340
<v Speaker 1>how did Ryan ever changed the world?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why do regions like Latin America need a</v>

54
00:02:38.341 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>company like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most important of all,</v>

55
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 1>how does Ryan App managed to author </v>
<v Speaker 1>these ludicrously low prices?</v>

56
00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:45.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer all those </v>

57
00:02:46.351 --> 00:02:47.184
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first let's take a look back at the </v>

58
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.340
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is Ryan Air so cheap?</v>

59
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:54.203
<v Speaker 1>Back in the 19 eighties and Madrid </v>
<v Speaker 1>salons in flight cost the equivalent of </v>

60
00:02:56.371 --> 00:03:00.850
<v Speaker 1>$700 back then in Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the average monthly wage.</v>

61
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:03.760
<v Speaker 1>Everyone understood that flying well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a luxury.</v>

62
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 1>I mean at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes,</v>

63
00:03:09.671 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 1>they're really expensive and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasn't really anything anyone could do.</v>

64
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.803
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reason why flights with that </v>

65
00:03:14.861 --> 00:03:18.910
<v Speaker 1>expensive actually had little to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology and just had much more to</v>

66
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:23.720
<v Speaker 1>do with politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

67
00:03:23.721 --> 00:03:26.110
<v Speaker 1>this really is true because back then </v>
<v Speaker 1>average,</v>

68
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.280
<v Speaker 1>they will based on agreements between </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

69
00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:29.233
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the French government and the American </v>

70
00:03:30.681 --> 00:03:31.700
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a deal,</v>

71
00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:32.593
<v Speaker 1>so only French and American airlines </v>
<v Speaker 1>could fly between Paris and New York </v>

72
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.393
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same happens with the rest of the </v>

73
00:03:38.751 --> 00:03:40.700
<v Speaker 1>European countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Airlines.</v>

74
00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:43.580
<v Speaker 1>They had essentially a monopoly over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>roots that they operate,</v>

75
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.393
<v Speaker 1>so there really was no incentive for </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to lower fares because they could </v>

76
00:03:52.801 --> 00:03:55.530
<v Speaker 1>simply make a fortune selling $700 </v>
<v Speaker 1>tickets.</v>

77
00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Back then it was really only British and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Irish people.</v>

78
00:03:57.991 --> 00:04:00.120
<v Speaker 1>You could enjoy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan as lower fares,</v>

79
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.510
<v Speaker 1>but then in April of 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>97 things,</v>

80
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>they changed for</v>

81
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.380
<v Speaker 2>any technically qualified airline in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>European Union.</v>

82
00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:13.303
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Norway and Iceland will be able to run </v>

83
00:04:14.631 --> 00:04:16.970
<v Speaker 2>services inside any other country.</v>

84
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.080
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these European carriers,</v>

85
00:04:19.081 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>they could compete against each other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really know how.</v>

86
00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.700
<v Speaker 1>This is why they are heavily invested in</v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising and more luxuries.</v>

87
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:27.593
<v Speaker 1>They make that a food more comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>seats and even gave corporate gifts to </v>

88
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:33.120
<v Speaker 1>passengers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronna instead,</v>

89
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.130
<v Speaker 1>they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's on a totally different strategy.</v>

90
00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.400
<v Speaker 2>Airlines are asking how they can put up </v>
<v Speaker 2>barriers.</v>

91
00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.280
<v Speaker 2>We are asking how we could get rid of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them</v>

92
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.390
<v Speaker 1>saying this in 1997,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was totally crazy.</v>

93
00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.253
<v Speaker 1>Of course there were already on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget guidelines like the American </v>

94
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.550
<v Speaker 1>Airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>southwest,</v>

95
00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.140
<v Speaker 1>but runner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to go even further.</v>

96
00:04:56.170 --> 00:05:00.040
<v Speaker 1>This is why they found new ways to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce the costs to an absolute minimum.</v>

97
00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:01.083
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the landing cost depended partly on the </v>

98
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 1>of the town lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid to the airports landing.</v>

99
00:05:05.201 --> 00:05:08.860
<v Speaker 1>It's Brussels central lab is costly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but 60 kilometers south,</v>

100
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:09.713
<v Speaker 1>if there is Charlotte Roy airports which</v>
<v Speaker 1>offers way lower landing fees simply by </v>

101
00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:15.410
<v Speaker 1>choosing to fly to that airport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan at,</v>

102
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.460
<v Speaker 1>they saved another cost saving policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was utilizing the same athlete model for</v>

103
00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>all of the roots and this airplane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the Boeing seven,</v>

104
00:05:27.401 --> 00:05:29.770
<v Speaker 1>three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seven other companies like Lufthansa,</v>

105
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.440
<v Speaker 1>they worked with over 14 different types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of airplanes.</v>

106
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.170
<v Speaker 1>This means they needed 14 maintenance </v>
<v Speaker 1>technicians.</v>

107
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:38.370
<v Speaker 1>Each of them are specialized on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different model of aircraft.</v>

108
00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:39.383
<v Speaker 1>Ronna instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could do the same with just a few </v>

109
00:05:41.171 --> 00:05:42.004
<v Speaker 1>experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that while Lufthansa needed </v>

110
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.940
<v Speaker 1>hours between flights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do maintenance checks,</v>

111
00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Ryanair needed half that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course after this,</v>

112
00:05:52.921 --> 00:05:53.754
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the extra costs that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>saved during the flights do you want to </v>

113
00:05:56.221 --> 00:05:57.380
<v Speaker 1>use on the airplane?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:05:57.381 --> 00:05:58.214
<v Speaker 1>that's extra.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to carry on baggage that's </v>

115
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.860
<v Speaker 1>extra to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Want to choose your seats every year,</v>

116
00:06:03.861 --> 00:06:06.830
<v Speaker 1>Ron and finds new ways to reduce costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

117
00:06:06.831 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago on the backs of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>seats,</v>

118
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.464
<v Speaker 1>they started posting adverts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the real turning points in this </v>

119
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:13.154
<v Speaker 1>company came in the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the time when Michael O'leary </v>

120
00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:20.460
<v Speaker 1>made a decision that changed the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry for</v>

121
00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:21.573
<v Speaker 3>bye.</v>

122
00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.050
<v Speaker 1>The travel agents take the out and shoot</v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

123
00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.780
<v Speaker 1>What have they done for passengers over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last years in the year?</v>

124
00:06:27.781 --> 00:06:28.614
<v Speaker 1>2,000 runner was the first company to </v>
<v Speaker 1>create a website where you could book </v>

125
00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:32.483
<v Speaker 1>tickets online.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prior to that it was impossible to buy </v>

126
00:06:34.651 --> 00:06:37.650
<v Speaker 1>your own plane ticket unless you lived </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the airport.</v>

127
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.560
<v Speaker 1>So travel agents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were a pretty essential middleman.</v>

128
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.453
<v Speaker 1>And of course these travel agents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've charged commissions and these </v>

129
00:06:43.831 --> 00:06:44.664
<v Speaker 1>conditions went up to 30 percent now in </v>
<v Speaker 1>stats passengers could just go to the </v>

130
00:06:48.091 --> 00:06:50.900
<v Speaker 1>website to find the cheapest flights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then bias,</v>

131
00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.800
<v Speaker 1>do they.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is completely normal,</v>

132
00:06:52.801 --> 00:06:56.370
<v Speaker 1>but back then it was a revolution and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they put lots of travel agents,</v>

133
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.100
<v Speaker 1>business with all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the year 2010,</v>

134
00:06:59.101 --> 00:06:59.934
<v Speaker 1>Ron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eh could offer tickets for an average </v>

135
00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:03.460
<v Speaker 1>price of 40 US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

136
00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.313
<v Speaker 1>that's cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's pretty ridiculous when you </v>

137
00:07:05.341 --> 00:07:08.520
<v Speaker 1>consider these $700 to get the we were </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about before.</v>

138
00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.521
<v Speaker 1>All right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

139
00:07:12.521 --> 00:07:14.980
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why aren't we saying cheap flights,</v>

140
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:16.180
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a revolution.</v>

141
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:17.283
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since Ryanair extended its business in </v>

142
00:07:18.911 --> 00:07:21.820
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of passengers has tripled.</v>

143
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:22.863
<v Speaker 1>Pay attention to the chart here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about much more than </v>

144
00:07:25.241 --> 00:07:26.074
<v Speaker 1>tourism here.</v>

145
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.480
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

146
00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:30.593
<v Speaker 1>thanks to cheap flights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Students exchange programs have </v>

147
00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 1>multiplied by five since 2007.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

148
00:07:35.611 --> 00:07:37.920
<v Speaker 1>if you are watching this video from </v>
<v Speaker 1>anywhere in Europe,</v>

149
00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:38.813
<v Speaker 1>you might have studied abroad with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>erasmus programme or have a friend do </v>

150
00:07:41.580 --> 00:07:43.830
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the same goes for labor mobility,</v>

151
00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.723
<v Speaker 1>which has tripled in a decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be hard to measure all the </v>

152
00:07:47.281 --> 00:07:50.100
<v Speaker 1>small businesses that have been born </v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to cheap flights.</v>

153
00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.700
<v Speaker 1>They can even allow the most modest </v>
<v Speaker 1>freelancer to find clients and another.</v>

154
00:07:53.701 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

155
00:07:53.840 --> 00:07:54.673
<v Speaker 3>I'm sorry,</v>

156
00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:01.070
<v Speaker 1>hold on for just a minute because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's another detail that we must keep</v>

157
00:08:01.071 --> 00:08:02.670
<v Speaker 1>in mindset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look carefully,</v>

158
00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:05.210
<v Speaker 1>you will see that while flying has </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased in Europe,</v>

159
00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:06.213
<v Speaker 1>Latin America seems to be immune to </v>
<v Speaker 1>those changes and didn't like to say </v>

160
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:12.440
<v Speaker 1>that the air effects it was worldwide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

161
00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:17.500
<v Speaker 1>well what happens in Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ryanair effect.</v>

162
00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:21.260
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronnette just operates in Europe.</v>

163
00:08:21.261 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how could they have such a big influence</v>

164
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:24.950
<v Speaker 1>on the rest of the wells?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

165
00:08:24.951 --> 00:08:27.620
<v Speaker 1>I'll let you draw your own conclusions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take Airasia.</v>

166
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:30.560
<v Speaker 1>They were an airline owned by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Malaysian government at the beginning of</v>

167
00:08:30.561 --> 00:08:33.350
<v Speaker 1>the two thousands that you want on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>verge of bankruptcy.</v>

168
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.810
<v Speaker 1>Then in 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Malaysian businessmen,</v>

169
00:08:35.811 --> 00:08:36.644
<v Speaker 1>Tony Fernandez bought it and followed </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ryanair model that it started to </v>

170
00:08:40.191 --> 00:08:43.310
<v Speaker 1>work in Europe and Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They adopted the slogan and now everyone</v>

171
00:08:43.311 --> 00:08:47.150
<v Speaker 1>can fly and they offered to the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>low cost flights on the continents.</v>

172
00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:51.410
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly Corolla the important Macau </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be done for less than $90.</v>

173
00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>It happened Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia then</v>

174
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 3>sold the birth of many other low cost </v>
<v Speaker 3>airlines from lion era of Indonesia to </v>

175
00:09:00.180 --> 00:09:01.013
<v Speaker 3>Cebu Pacific and the Philippines.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Even a country as poor and as big as </v>

176
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:05.033
<v Speaker 3>India has seen it,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the amount of passengers triple in just </v>

177
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.760
<v Speaker 3>10 years.</v>

178
00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:12.913
<v Speaker 1>Hold on again for just a minute because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still that pulse of the planet </v>

179
00:09:14.691 --> 00:09:18.440
<v Speaker 1>which seems immune to the Ryan Air </v>
<v Speaker 1>Effects and this area as we mentioned,</v>

180
00:09:18.441 --> 00:09:19.274
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Latin America for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cheap flight between Bogota or in </v>

181
00:09:21.981 --> 00:09:22.814
<v Speaker 1>Colombia and Mexico City costs $460.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John's compare that with the $86 that </v>

182
00:09:28.100 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>you could pay going from quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>important Taipei,</v>

183
00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.540
<v Speaker 1>and in case you want to check the </v>
<v Speaker 1>distance,</v>

184
00:09:32.541 --> 00:09:33.710
<v Speaker 1>both are more or less than</v>

185
00:09:34.030 --> 00:09:35.300
<v Speaker 3>dot,</v>

186
00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>and the same goes if you want to go from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Libor and Peru to La Paz in Bolivia.</v>

187
00:09:41.710 --> 00:09:45.370
<v Speaker 1>This is a three hour flight and it costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>$600 and yes,</v>

188
00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.720
<v Speaker 1>this is more than the average monthly </v>
<v Speaker 1>wage in most Latin American countries.</v>

189
00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.763
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering why is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>so damn expensive to fly in Latin </v>

190
00:09:55.090 --> 00:09:55.923
<v Speaker 1>America?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't they have some Ryanair like </v>

191
00:09:56.980 --> 00:09:59.560
<v Speaker 1>company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The answer lies again in politics.</v>

192
00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:00.543
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legislation in the region has made it </v>

193
00:10:02.111 --> 00:10:07.111
<v Speaker 1>impossible for a company to appear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If an airline wants to work in Brazil,</v>

194
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.563
<v Speaker 1>they need to have at least 20 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>their capital owned by resilience and </v>

195
00:10:16.201 --> 00:10:18.600
<v Speaker 1>two years ago this percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was even higher.</v>

196
00:10:18.630 --> 00:10:19.463
<v Speaker 1>This is why it went avianca re,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Colombian carrier wanted to open two </v>

197
00:10:22.081 --> 00:10:22.914
<v Speaker 1>markets in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government forced them to start a </v>

198
00:10:25.051 --> 00:10:27.480
<v Speaker 1>brand new company with their </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters in Brazil.</v>

199
00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:29.910
<v Speaker 1>Thus Avianca runs Avianca,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

200
00:10:29.911 --> 00:10:30.744
<v Speaker 1>all two entirely different companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite the fact that they do belong to </v>

201
00:10:33.631 --> 00:10:34.464
<v Speaker 1>the same group that Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that'll be any country that protects </v>

202
00:10:36.421 --> 00:10:37.254
<v Speaker 1>their analysis.</v>

203
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.250
<v Speaker 2>Year 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentenians wanted to fly.</v>

204
00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:48.140
<v Speaker 2>I could only choose between two </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

205
00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.033
<v Speaker 2>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lat am a private carrier and outer your </v>

206
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.163
<v Speaker 2>lineage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentina's a state owned airline for </v>

207
00:10:54.291 --> 00:10:55.124
<v Speaker 2>decades that Christina Fernandez,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the administration made sure no other </v>

208
00:10:59.781 --> 00:11:01.940
<v Speaker 2>airline could compete with these </v>
<v Speaker 2>airlines,</v>

209
00:11:02.090 --> 00:11:05.640
<v Speaker 1>and the same goes for the airports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the that could cut costs.</v>

210
00:11:05.641 --> 00:11:07.940
<v Speaker 1>It's thanks to you taking off and </v>
<v Speaker 1>landing at airports.</v>

211
00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:08.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is possibly in Europe because one </v>

212
00:11:10.311 --> 00:11:11.144
<v Speaker 1>out of every four airport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some managed by a marriage between the </v>

213
00:11:13.760 --> 00:11:15.350
<v Speaker 1>government and private companies.</v>

214
00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.153
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to this airports must compete </v>
<v Speaker 1>with each other by offering better </v>

215
00:11:22.261 --> 00:11:25.980
<v Speaker 1>services and love affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not by chance that half of European</v>

216
00:11:25.981 --> 00:11:26.814
<v Speaker 1>air traffic comes from private airports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America though it's a different </v>

217
00:11:29.671 --> 00:11:30.504
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of their airports are managed </v>

218
00:11:31.831 --> 00:11:34.560
<v Speaker 1>solely by the governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is no competition,</v>

219
00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:36.990
<v Speaker 1>they simply have no interest in reducing</v>
<v Speaker 1>fats.</v>

220
00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:40.680
<v Speaker 1>And other words Brian Enter is failed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>have an effect on this region because of</v>

221
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:43.230
<v Speaker 1>politics and well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the consequences of this?</v>

222
00:11:43.410 --> 00:11:45.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that there's many Latin</v>

223
00:11:45.540 --> 00:11:48.150
<v Speaker 1>American countries have grown </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically in the past few years,</v>

224
00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>flying is still a privilege for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>

225
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 4>This is my vision.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I've been to the mountaintop.</v>

226
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:54.940
<v Speaker 4>I've seen the lights.</v>

227
00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:56.673
<v Speaker 1>Now the question becomes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think Latin America should </v>

228
00:11:58.901 --> 00:12:02.050
<v Speaker 1>liberalize its aspects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that everyone could benefit</v>

229
00:12:02.051 --> 00:12:04.990
<v Speaker 1>from a company like Ron out operating in</v>
<v Speaker 1>his own country?</v>

230
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:05.980
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please do it.</v>

231
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:06.843
<v Speaker 1>Leave your answers in the comments </v>
<v Speaker 1>section below because we'd love to hear </v>

232
00:12:08.801 --> 00:12:09.611
<v Speaker 1>from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

233
