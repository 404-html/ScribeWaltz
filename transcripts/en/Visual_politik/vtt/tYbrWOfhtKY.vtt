1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand's is a remarkable country </v>
<v Speaker 1>with little more than four and a half </v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.720
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants in a surface area of</v>
<v Speaker 1>268,000</v>

3
00:00:06.721 --> 00:00:09.930
<v Speaker 1>square kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a little bit smaller than Japan or</v>

4
00:00:09.931 --> 00:00:10.764
<v Speaker 1>Italy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is located in the South Pacific and </v>

5
00:00:17.331 --> 00:00:19.670
<v Speaker 1>we could say it in New Zealand is fall </v>
<v Speaker 1>from,</v>

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:20.563
<v Speaker 1>well literally everything because even </v>
<v Speaker 1>though it feels like it's right near </v>

7
00:00:24.561 --> 00:00:25.394
<v Speaker 1>Australia by looking at the map,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these new countries are separated by </v>

8
00:00:27.981 --> 00:00:30.320
<v Speaker 1>more than 1000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>600 kilometers.</v>

9
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.183
<v Speaker 1>Absent that closest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why we can find that endemic </v>

10
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:37.610
<v Speaker 1>species such as the Kiwi and non-flying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nocturnal birds.</v>

11
00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.533
<v Speaker 1>Being such an isolated country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand has managed to become the </v>

12
00:00:43.701 --> 00:00:45.290
<v Speaker 1>following,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rather unique model.</v>

13
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.610
<v Speaker 1>One of the countries in the welds </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoying is one of the highest standards</v>

14
00:00:49.611 --> 00:00:51.080
<v Speaker 1>of living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this first video,</v>

15
00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:51.914
<v Speaker 1>we're going to tell you about some of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most striking keys to New Zealand's </v>

16
00:00:54.651 --> 00:00:55.484
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

17
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.360
<v Speaker 1>There is an entrepreneur comments or </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeling if you wish,</v>

18
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:07.194
<v Speaker 1>which takes place over and over again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every time someone is asked about New </v>

19
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.603
<v Speaker 1>Zealand's after a visit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all sing it as a country of </v>

20
00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:17.610
<v Speaker 1>congeniality and his quality of life,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that country that everyone seems to want</v>

21
00:01:17.611 --> 00:01:18.444
<v Speaker 1>to go back to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to say categorically that I </v>

22
00:01:21.191 --> 00:01:24.780
<v Speaker 1>have found no other country that aligns </v>
<v Speaker 1>more with my view of the future.</v>

23
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.160
<v Speaker 1>The New Zealand Peter Teal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if something is for sure,</v>

24
00:01:29.161 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 1>it is that New Zealand is above all a </v>
<v Speaker 1>welcoming integrating country.</v>

25
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>So how about we look at a piece of </v>
<v Speaker 1>evidence for that?</v>

26
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.593
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you consider this one out of four of </v>

27
00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:39.564
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand's inhabitants has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad and here sign language is </v>

28
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:43.074
<v Speaker 1>considered an official language.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This isn't certainly have plenty of </v>

29
00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:49.110
<v Speaker 1>reasons to be happy and more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>satisfied.</v>

30
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.500
<v Speaker 1>Further New Zealand is one of the top </v>
<v Speaker 1>five safest countries in the world.</v>

31
00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Its economy is the third freest on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire planet and according to the doing</v>

32
00:01:56.551 --> 00:01:57.384
<v Speaker 1>business ranking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the number one country in the </v>

33
00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:02.100
<v Speaker 1>world when it comes to the ease of doing</v>
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>

34
00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.750
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

35
00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:07.950
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand dethrone Singapore as </v>
<v Speaker 1>easiest place to do business.</v>

36
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Both for this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the end of our story today,</v>

37
00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:13.920
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand is also considered the least</v>

38
00:02:13.921 --> 00:02:16.440
<v Speaker 1>corrupt country in the world along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark.</v>

39
00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.420
<v Speaker 1>Employment rates here are higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the average and the OACD,</v>

40
00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.490
<v Speaker 1>and it has excellent educational,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sanitary and cultural systems.</v>

41
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.383
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand is both an economic and </v>

42
00:02:26.401 --> 00:02:29.760
<v Speaker 1>social success story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but leaving all of that aside.</v>

43
00:02:29.761 --> 00:02:30.594
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to focus on one of the most </v>

44
00:02:32.341 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>distinctive keys to its success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the countryside.</v>

45
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:44.210
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand of land a farm using is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only developed country where the primary</v>

46
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:48.500
<v Speaker 1>sector has become more relevant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last three decades.</v>

47
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.670
<v Speaker 1>This sector represents today almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven percent of the country's economy</v>

48
00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:56.260
<v Speaker 2>see</v>

49
00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.093
<v Speaker 1>highlights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just quite how much of this is consider </v>

50
00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.264
<v Speaker 1>the fact that primary sector is just one</v>
<v Speaker 1>point six percent of the economy of the </v>

51
00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.863
<v Speaker 1>European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Four Times less than New Zealand's even </v>

52
00:03:06.461 --> 00:03:07.294
<v Speaker 1>Spain who's primary sector represents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's are more than two percent of </v>

53
00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.384
<v Speaker 1>its economy and is considered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Orchard of Europe looks pretty </v>

54
00:03:12.641 --> 00:03:16.150
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous when compared to the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we're discussing today.</v>

55
00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:19.840
<v Speaker 1>There is simply no equivalence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>

56
00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:20.733
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>milk and dairy here are the largest </v>

57
00:03:22.541 --> 00:03:24.340
<v Speaker 1>exports from New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>if we add goofy primary sector to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Agri food industry,</v>

59
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.320
<v Speaker 1>these two represent 60 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation's trade exports.</v>

60
00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.863
<v Speaker 1>I really thought this could be possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the countryside could be the main </v>

61
00:03:50.021 --> 00:03:50.854
<v Speaker 1>economic engine in the country with one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the best welfare systems and </v>

62
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:56.050
<v Speaker 1>standards of living on the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

63
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:56.884
<v Speaker 1>So it is quite simply rather amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The agricultural competition here is so </v>

64
00:04:00.371 --> 00:04:01.204
<v Speaker 1>high that they even managed to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>this without having to rely on </v>

65
00:04:03.881 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>governmental subsidies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider the difference.</v>

66
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.233
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

67
00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:09.493
<v Speaker 3>The European Union grants agriculture </v>
<v Speaker 3>and livestock subsidies worth around 21 </v>

68
00:04:13.311 --> 00:04:14.150
<v Speaker 3>percent of total</v>

69
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.993
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

70
00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.403
<v Speaker 3>The European Union has foreseen that </v>
<v Speaker 3>they will have to give 55 billion US </v>

71
00:04:22.381 --> 00:04:25.900
<v Speaker 3>dollars in farming support between the </v>
<v Speaker 3>years 2014 and 20,</v>

72
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 1>and don't be thinking that the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>system is any difference now.</v>

73
00:04:31.331 --> 00:04:32.164
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in North America it subsidies are a </v>

74
00:04:33.481 --> 00:04:34.314
<v Speaker 1>bit lower than they are in the EU,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they all still around eight percent </v>

75
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.320
<v Speaker 1>of all agricultural production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:41.610
<v Speaker 1>that's a loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

77
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.830
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand does have some government </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies,</v>

78
00:04:43.831 --> 00:04:46.530
<v Speaker 1>but they aren't just zero point nine </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of production,</v>

79
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:47.393
<v Speaker 1>which is 23 times less than the European</v>
<v Speaker 1>Union and to almost 10 times less than </v>

80
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:53.220
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad,</v>

81
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:54.150
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides,</v>

82
00:04:54.151 --> 00:04:57.720
<v Speaker 1>if this wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand spending is mostly bound for</v>

83
00:04:57.721 --> 00:05:02.721
<v Speaker 1>investments and innovation as you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing thanks to save a great deal,</v>

84
00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.590
<v Speaker 1>but this hasn't always been the case.</v>

85
00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.930
<v Speaker 3>Roger nomics and the New Zealand or </v>
<v Speaker 3>farming</v>

86
00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.003
<v Speaker 2>Lucia</v>

87
00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 1>in the early 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 40 percent of farming income came</v>

88
00:05:23.561 --> 00:05:26.650
<v Speaker 1>from government subsidies at the time </v>
<v Speaker 1>the national economy.</v>

89
00:05:26.651 --> 00:05:29.500
<v Speaker 1>It was the archetype of protectionism </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the system.</v>

90
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:30.383
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we didn't exactly work the economy over </v>

91
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:34.450
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was going through a tough crisis.</v>

92
00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 2>The public</v>

93
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.430
<v Speaker 3>deficit was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Almost 10 percent of the national GDP.</v>

94
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:42.293
<v Speaker 3>There was double digit inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The external debt and unemployment kept </v>

95
00:05:44.851 --> 00:05:47.090
<v Speaker 3>rising and the economy was in a state of</v>
<v Speaker 3>Texas</v>

96
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.400
<v Speaker 2>nation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

97
00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:50.343
<v Speaker 1>in 1984,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economics minister of the recently </v>

98
00:05:52.301 --> 00:05:54.280
<v Speaker 1>elected Labor governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Douglas,</v>

99
00:05:54.281 --> 00:05:58.760
<v Speaker 1>started and ambitious reform program </v>
<v Speaker 1>known as Roger Nomix in this program.</v>

100
00:05:58.761 --> 00:05:59.594
<v Speaker 1>At many areas of the economy were </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalized and this included the </v>

101
00:06:01.971 --> 00:06:05.690
<v Speaker 1>primary sector and these changes took </v>
<v Speaker 1>place almost overnight.</v>

102
00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:09.380
<v Speaker 1>Price controls were eliminated and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming subsidies were removed.</v>

103
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to fight inflation,</v>

104
00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:16.030
<v Speaker 1>the government decided to raise interest</v>
<v Speaker 1>rates.</v>

105
00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:19.660
<v Speaker 1>This was really unpopular and farmers </v>
<v Speaker 1>were angry since they'd gone into debt.</v>

106
00:06:19.661 --> 00:06:23.170
<v Speaker 1>In previous years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the perfect storm income falls,</v>

107
00:06:23.171 --> 00:06:24.004
<v Speaker 1>debt interest spending increases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was a fall in the price of </v>

108
00:06:27.011 --> 00:06:28.570
<v Speaker 1>lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

109
00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:33.630
<v Speaker 1>this change wasn't easy and it all </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to indicate a future disaster.</v>

110
00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.593
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country soon felt the benefits of </v>

111
00:06:35.951 --> 00:06:36.784
<v Speaker 1>putting an end to subsidization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The income fully encouraged farmers to </v>

112
00:06:40.121 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 1>look the innovations capable of raising </v>
<v Speaker 1>the levels of production.</v>

113
00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:44.053
<v Speaker 1>They introduce new crops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improve the quality of their current </v>

114
00:06:46.241 --> 00:06:47.074
<v Speaker 1>crops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and used more ecological farming </v>

115
00:06:48.491 --> 00:06:49.324
<v Speaker 1>methods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply have to find a way to stand </v>

116
00:06:51.191 --> 00:06:52.800
<v Speaker 1>out from the crowd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

117
00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:53.673
<v Speaker 1>they began to be very careful about cost</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't just about maximizing the </v>

118
00:06:57.401 --> 00:07:01.210
<v Speaker 1>production of subsidized products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had to improve the value chain,</v>

119
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.850
<v Speaker 1>adapt to consumers and reduced costs.</v>

120
00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:06.520
<v Speaker 1>Let's consider an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Subsidizing fertilizers.</v>

121
00:07:06.521 --> 00:07:07.354
<v Speaker 1>Had resulted in the careless use of them</v>
<v Speaker 1>when there were no more subsidies for </v>

122
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.164
<v Speaker 1>these fertilizers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of fertilizers fell without </v>

123
00:07:13.331 --> 00:07:16.450
<v Speaker 1>affecting production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Farmers learns to only use them whenever</v>

124
00:07:16.451 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 1>necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps with the cost of production,</v>

125
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:19.743
<v Speaker 1>but also helps the environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same happens with other things and </v>

126
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:23.254
<v Speaker 1>this created a more efficient and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainable agricultural system when we </v>

127
00:07:26.711 --> 00:07:29.930
<v Speaker 1>consider the new crops and products that</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand started producing.</v>

128
00:07:29.931 --> 00:07:33.550
<v Speaker 1>Theory is probably no better example </v>
<v Speaker 1>than that of the wine industry.</v>

129
00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:36.970
<v Speaker 1>The space dedicated to two vineyards has</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost tripled in the last decade,</v>

130
00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.120
<v Speaker 1>and New Zealand wine has become known </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

131
00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:42.880
<v Speaker 1>More over with the goal of finding new </v>
<v Speaker 1>revenue sources.</v>

132
00:07:42.881 --> 00:07:47.620
<v Speaker 1>The rural population started to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>additional businesses like rural tourism</v>

133
00:07:47.621 --> 00:07:48.454
<v Speaker 1>or elaborate agrifood products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both closely relying on environmental </v>

134
00:07:51.431 --> 00:07:52.264
<v Speaker 1>preservation and a highly valued brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This meant that the farmers started to </v>

135
00:08:03.951 --> 00:08:05.800
<v Speaker 1>commit to the protection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>

136
00:08:05.870 --> 00:08:06.703
<v Speaker 1>Now has realized that preservation of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ecosystem was also profitable in </v>

137
00:08:10.401 --> 00:08:12.620
<v Speaker 1>economic terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The results of this well,</v>

138
00:08:12.621 --> 00:08:14.540
<v Speaker 1>it was an incredible revolution.</v>

139
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.150
<v Speaker 3>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 3>only 800 interests,</v>

140
00:08:18.270 --> 00:08:19.103
<v Speaker 3>one percent of all of them had to close </v>
<v Speaker 3>down and in the next 20 years after </v>

141
00:08:21.841 --> 00:08:25.290
<v Speaker 3>1986,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the production in this sector grew by 40</v>

142
00:08:25.291 --> 00:08:26.124
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

143
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:31.620
<v Speaker 1>Pay Close attention to that figure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since the removal of subsidies,</v>

144
00:08:31.621 --> 00:08:35.100
<v Speaker 1>the primary sector has grown more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the economy.</v>

145
00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:36.873
<v Speaker 3>Nineteen 86 and 2006.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The primary sector had sustained growth </v>

146
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 3>of five point nine percent per year.</v>

147
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.510
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand</v>

148
00:08:51.510 --> 00:08:54.300
<v Speaker 1>really has thrived after the removal of </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies,</v>

149
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.193
<v Speaker 1>along with this internalization is also </v>
<v Speaker 1>key and let them Use Zealand's </v>

150
00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:02.160
<v Speaker 1>countryside competitively export more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 90 percent of its production.</v>

151
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.023
<v Speaker 1>And in addition to all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's all incredibly environmentally </v>

152
00:09:05.401 --> 00:09:06.780
<v Speaker 1>friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I mean,</v>

153
00:09:06.810 --> 00:09:09.830
<v Speaker 1>what else could we possibly ask for New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand Dfu up?</v>

154
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:10.703
<v Speaker 1>It's the perfect example of how bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies and subsidization can damage </v>

155
00:09:14.341 --> 00:09:16.140
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diversification,</v>

156
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:19.620
<v Speaker 1>and productivity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while at the same time creating a burden</v>

157
00:09:19.621 --> 00:09:20.454
<v Speaker 1>for the public economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what is happening with </v>

158
00:09:22.681 --> 00:09:23.514
<v Speaker 1>the CIP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European protectionist agricultural </v>

159
00:09:25.321 --> 00:09:27.530
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which costs around $50,</v>

160
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:30.930
<v Speaker 1>billion euros every single year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the contrary,</v>

161
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand shows that by doing things </v>
<v Speaker 1>right,</v>

162
00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.580
<v Speaker 1>it is not only possible to save a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

163
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time it's possible for </v>
<v Speaker 1>rural areas to improve substantially.</v>

164
00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:40.883
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand has absolutely proven that </v>
<v Speaker 1>farming can prosper without public aid </v>

165
00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:48.780
<v Speaker 1>and while New Zealand is trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>double that falling exports by 20,</v>

166
00:09:48.781 --> 00:09:50.340
<v Speaker 1>25 for the rest of the country's.</v>

167
00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:53.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll still involved in the debate around</v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidization,</v>

168
00:09:53.610 --> 00:09:54.443
<v Speaker 1>but that's our opinion here at Fisher </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic and we'd love to know what you </v>

169
00:09:56.911 --> 00:09:57.744
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the countryside will die </v>

170
00:09:59.011 --> 00:10:01.440
<v Speaker 1>without public aid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand's success?</v>

171
00:10:01.441 --> 00:10:03.390
<v Speaker 1>Could it be replicated somewhere else?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

172
00:10:03.391 --> 00:10:06.540
<v Speaker 1>we'd love to know what you think.</v>
