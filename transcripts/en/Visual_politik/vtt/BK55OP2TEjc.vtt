00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.553
<v Speaker 1>In the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has been growing uncertainty and </v>

2
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:14.140
<v Speaker 1>concern over what's the future of jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>will look like,</v>

3
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.630
<v Speaker 1>especially for those who are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed countries,</v>

4
00:00:16.631 --> 00:00:17.710
<v Speaker 1>robotics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ai,</v>

5
00:00:17.711 --> 00:00:19.690
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>international competition.</v>

6
00:00:19.691 --> 00:00:21.250
<v Speaker 1>They are all hot topics.</v>

7
00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.273
<v Speaker 2>Six,</v>

8
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.923
<v Speaker 1>according to some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we will have to get used to a future </v>

9
00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:30.254
<v Speaker 1>where a job will be considered a luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a world of unemployment on a massive </v>

10
00:00:33.981 --> 00:00:36.500
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It'll be a world of higher inequality,</v>

11
00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.393
<v Speaker 1>of poor working conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just for those who aren't </v>

12
00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:40.340
<v Speaker 1>lucky enough to have it.</v>

13
00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.283
<v Speaker 2>Job</v>

14
00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>is not the west of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the people who are foreseen such</v>

15
00:00:49.601 --> 00:00:53.650
<v Speaker 1>a critical situation also claimed this </v>
<v Speaker 1>and less major changes take place and we</v>

16
00:00:53.651 --> 00:00:55.660
<v Speaker 1>try to slow down this frantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments.</v>

17
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.160
<v Speaker 1>Our wellbeing will be in serious danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly if there are not enough jobs,</v>

18
00:01:00.161 --> 00:01:00.994
<v Speaker 1>wealth and production will concentrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a reduced but powerful oligarchy of </v>

19
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.150
<v Speaker 1>businessmen and companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this leads to the question,</v>

20
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.030
<v Speaker 1>how will ordinary people make a living </v>
<v Speaker 1>who will pay taxes?</v>

21
00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:10.893
<v Speaker 1>How can the welfare state possibly </v>
<v Speaker 1>survived for with so much </v>

22
00:01:12.941 --> 00:01:15.430
<v Speaker 1>unemployment's?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all sounds pretty dreary,</v>

23
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:16.293
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost as if we're going to be facing a </v>

24
00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>terrible storm many year now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This uncertainty,</v>

25
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>it's made it easier for leaders like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump or marine le pen,</v>

26
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.410
<v Speaker 1>among others to get a leg up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

27
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.273
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leaders who say that society is falling </v>

28
00:01:28.901 --> 00:01:31.900
<v Speaker 1>apart and insist that they are the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>ones who can fix it.</v>

29
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.270
<v Speaker 1>Do you tend to do rather well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

30
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.133
<v Speaker 1>if there is such a thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the only thing we can do is fight </v>

31
00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.120
<v Speaker 1>back and it is not just immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about here.</v>

32
00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.920
<v Speaker 1>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is so,</v>

33
00:01:41.921 --> 00:01:42.754
<v Speaker 1>so much more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Amazon is doing great damage tax paying </v>

34
00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:47.980
<v Speaker 1>retailers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>towns,</v>

35
00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.740
<v Speaker 1>cities and states throughout the u.</v>
<v Speaker 1>s are being hurt.</v>

36
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.120
<v Speaker 1>Many jobs being lost at real.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump on twitter,</v>

37
00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:55.983
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a second because are we</v>
<v Speaker 1>really had such a dark and dreary </v>

38
00:01:59.891 --> 00:02:00.724
<v Speaker 1>future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our robots are really going to take our </v>

39
00:02:02.141 --> 00:02:04.480
<v Speaker 1>jobs and destroy the system as we know </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

40
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.090
<v Speaker 1>And is it true that unless we take </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical action,</v>

41
00:02:07.091 --> 00:02:09.580
<v Speaker 1>we are in serious danger of losing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs?</v>

42
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.443
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in order to answer these questions and </v>

43
00:02:11.591 --> 00:02:13.450
<v Speaker 1>look at what lies beneath these </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements,</v>

44
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:14.284
<v Speaker 1>we have to pay close attention to what </v>
<v Speaker 1>is currently happening in the world we </v>

45
00:02:16.931 --> 00:02:17.764
<v Speaker 1>live in and especially what is going on </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the greatest and most influential </v>

46
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:22.570
<v Speaker 1>power on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

47
00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.960
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the United States of</v>

48
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.793
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

49
00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.930
<v Speaker 2>the end of employment,</v>

50
00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.260
<v Speaker 1>self driving cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>self learning machinery,</v>

51
00:02:35.261 --> 00:02:37.810
<v Speaker 1>factories without work as intelligent </v>
<v Speaker 1>robots,</v>

52
00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:38.693
<v Speaker 1>less science fiction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then more science facts every single </v>

53
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.660
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know this technological wave.</v>

54
00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.850
<v Speaker 1>It's just begun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nanotechnology,</v>

55
00:02:45.851 --> 00:02:48.760
<v Speaker 1>biotechnology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>genetic engineering and robotics.</v>

56
00:02:48.761 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>They seem to be changing the world as we</v>
<v Speaker 1>know it every day.</v>

57
00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.073
<v Speaker 1>These technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplying productivity and they can </v>

58
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.983
<v Speaker 1>even replace human work in a report to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the president from 2000 and Sixteen </v>

59
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.363
<v Speaker 1>Council of economic advisors in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>White House calculated that 83 percent </v>

60
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:03.694
<v Speaker 1>of jobs that were paid less than $20 per</v>
<v Speaker 1>hour would soon potentially be </v>

61
00:03:07.121 --> 00:03:08.530
<v Speaker 1>automated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

62
00:03:08.531 --> 00:03:09.364
<v Speaker 1>countries with a faster development in </v>
<v Speaker 1>robotics will be the first to suffer </v>

63
00:03:13.151 --> 00:03:13.984
<v Speaker 1>from high sudden unemployment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions and millions of people will </v>

64
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.400
<v Speaker 1>simply become unemployed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question now has to be,</v>

65
00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:24.070
<v Speaker 1>is this really what the future holds the</v>
<v Speaker 1>future?</v>

66
00:03:24.071 --> 00:03:24.904
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's always uncertain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can already see what's happening </v>

67
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.190
<v Speaker 1>today and compare that to what it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be like in the future.</v>

68
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.353
<v Speaker 1>Robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've already arrived and we can find </v>

69
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>them everywhere in today's factories and</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we really dive into the figures,</v>

70
00:03:36.821 --> 00:03:40.690
<v Speaker 1>we see that the evidence shows the exact</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposite of what we might expect.</v>

71
00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:44.470
<v Speaker 1>So just take a look at this chart here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The countries using the most robots,</v>

72
00:03:44.471 --> 00:03:48.400
<v Speaker 1>other countries with the lowest rates of</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment as well.</v>

73
00:03:48.401 --> 00:03:49.234
<v Speaker 1>This it has an explanation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes we consider all the jobs that </v>

74
00:03:52.061 --> 00:03:52.894
<v Speaker 1>are lost as a result of this process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we ignore the new jobs that are </v>

75
00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:59.200
<v Speaker 1>being created as a result of all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>automation,</v>

76
00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:06.470
<v Speaker 1>new times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new jobs.</v>

77
00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 2>Up until</v>

78
00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.033
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the industrial sector is the one when </v>

79
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:13.090
<v Speaker 1>most robots have been used.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

80
00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.953
<v Speaker 1>some companies like Ford already have </v>
<v Speaker 1>assembly lines made entirely out of </v>

81
00:04:17.171 --> 00:04:20.530
<v Speaker 1>robots having no human workers at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>

82
00:04:20.531 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>American industrial production is almost</v>
<v Speaker 1>as high as it has ever been,</v>

83
00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.670
<v Speaker 1>and now you must be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

84
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.390
<v Speaker 1>what happens to all the industrial jobs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.420
<v Speaker 1>have a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right in the 19 forties,</v>

86
00:04:33.581 --> 00:04:34.414
<v Speaker 1>one of every three jobs in America where</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial jobs and now the number is </v>

87
00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.140
<v Speaker 1>barely one in 12,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is four times less.</v>

88
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.033
<v Speaker 1>So does this mean that there are no </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment opportunities in the United </v>

89
00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:45.340
<v Speaker 1>States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.260
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing's further from the truth.</v>

91
00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:48.123
<v Speaker 1>Since the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US has created more than 86 million </v>

92
00:04:51.221 --> 00:04:54.130
<v Speaker 1>new jobs in the service industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes transport,</v>

93
00:04:54.131 --> 00:04:55.570
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>entertainment,</v>

94
00:04:55.571 --> 00:04:57.670
<v Speaker 1>and so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

95
00:04:57.671 --> 00:04:58.504
<v Speaker 1>there has never been so many workers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country and while we are </v>

96
00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.500
<v Speaker 1>specifically talking about robotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

97
00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.790
<v Speaker 1>the impacts of any new technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has a similar effect.</v>

98
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:07.653
<v Speaker 1>Blockbuster,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was once the largest video and </v>

99
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>video game rental company in America may</v>
<v Speaker 1>have vanished.</v>

100
00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.843
<v Speaker 1>Putin exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have new companies like Netflix or </v>

101
00:05:15.161 --> 00:05:17.290
<v Speaker 1>even youtube and these kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

102
00:05:17.291 --> 00:05:18.124
<v Speaker 1>They generate loads of jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not just happening in </v>

103
00:05:20.411 --> 00:05:23.650
<v Speaker 1>America and it's not just happening with</v>
<v Speaker 1>robots or with video.</v>

104
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.513
<v Speaker 1>Consider the APP industry in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This new industry has already created </v>

105
00:05:28.241 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>more than 113,000 jobs in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthiest countries in the world.</v>

106
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.723
<v Speaker 1>I believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not just an Australian </v>

107
00:05:34.991 --> 00:05:35.824
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon in the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 1>deberry mind that this is a new sector </v>

108
00:05:38.261 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>that has been born just a few years ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the iphone and it's already created</v>

109
00:05:41.831 --> 00:05:43.960
<v Speaker 1>one point 5 million jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Banks,</v>

110
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.150
<v Speaker 1>supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance and software companies.</v>

111
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:47.133
<v Speaker 1>They all want to have their own app and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that means new jobs are being created </v>

112
00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:52.330
<v Speaker 1>all of the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

113
00:05:52.331 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>as productivity grows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>normal working hours,</v>

114
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>they're reduced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so thanks to technology will work hours,</v>

115
00:05:57.830 --> 00:05:59.390
<v Speaker 1>which is another bit of great news.</v>

116
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.993
<v Speaker 1>I think for the next 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People only work four hours a day and </v>

117
00:06:07.461 --> 00:06:08.294
<v Speaker 1>maybe four days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather worked 16 hours a day in </v>

118
00:06:10.461 --> 00:06:12.290
<v Speaker 1>the farmland and thought he was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>busy.</v>

119
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.410
<v Speaker 1>We work eight hours five days a week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we are very busy.</v>

120
00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:19.460
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma and finally let's as a little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more detail,</v>

121
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.323
<v Speaker 1>some people like Bill Gates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've claimed the robots have taken </v>

122
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:24.830
<v Speaker 1>jobs that were previously done by </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

123
00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>Then therefore they should have to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>paying tax and you know what?</v>

124
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:29.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not so sure about that.</v>

125
00:06:29.721 --> 00:06:31.940
<v Speaker 1>I need robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are just machines.</v>

126
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Simply the more machines and the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology we have,</v>

127
00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the better we live.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Robots reduce costs and as a consequence</v>

128
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:41.300
<v Speaker 1>they reduced the price of goods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

129
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.060
<v Speaker 1>It allows consumers to work less and </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying more,</v>

130
00:06:44.061 --> 00:06:48.830
<v Speaker 1>and this is why governments should boost</v>
<v Speaker 1>and encourage investment in technology,</v>

131
00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:49.723
<v Speaker 1>but what is certainly true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the society will have to prepare </v>

132
00:06:52.041 --> 00:06:54.950
<v Speaker 1>for this automation process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this technological change.</v>

133
00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:57.470
<v Speaker 1>It is coming and it shouldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped.</v>

134
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:03.893
<v Speaker 1>Stop globalization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have you who regularly follow up visual </v>

135
00:07:07.991 --> 00:07:11.440
<v Speaker 1>policy will know that trump has </v>
<v Speaker 1>something of an obsession with China,</v>

136
00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.220
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>

137
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:17.860
<v Speaker 2>I love China all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I Love Jack.</v>

138
00:07:18.770 --> 00:07:20.570
<v Speaker 1>It's not just China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last year,</v>

139
00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:22.310
<v Speaker 1>trump is accused Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

140
00:07:22.311 --> 00:07:23.144
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even South Korea of unfair </v>

141
00:07:24.951 --> 00:07:27.740
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has also claimed that these countries</v>

142
00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:28.633
<v Speaker 1>are destroying American jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why trump wants to renegotiate </v>

143
00:07:32.211 --> 00:07:34.820
<v Speaker 1>trade agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>empower protectionist policies,</v>

144
00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:38.480
<v Speaker 1>and if needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set import tariffs in industries such as</v>

145
00:07:38.481 --> 00:07:39.314
<v Speaker 1>the steel industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't be the first president in </v>

146
00:07:41.031 --> 00:07:44.700
<v Speaker 1>the US to pursue this kind of strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need look no further than that.</v>

147
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:45.853
<v Speaker 1>George W dot Bush and other Republicans </v>
<v Speaker 1>who set up import terrorists to steel </v>

148
00:07:48.921 --> 00:07:53.210
<v Speaker 1>imports in 2002.</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Bush took some of the broadest</v>

149
00:07:53.211 --> 00:07:57.200
<v Speaker 1>federal action in two decades to protect</v>
<v Speaker 1>a major American industry today,</v>

150
00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:58.093
<v Speaker 1>imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>most types of steel imported into the </v>

151
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.650
<v Speaker 1>United States from Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>

152
00:08:03.740 --> 00:08:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and South America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and truth be told the result,</v>

153
00:08:07.341 --> 00:08:08.174
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some studies have estimated that these </v>

154
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 1>steel tariffs resulted in the loss of </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 200,000 jobs.</v>

155
00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:19.500
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

156
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:23.130
<v Speaker 1>Not Policy lead to more unemployment's </v>
<v Speaker 1>less competition.</v>

157
00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.840
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's another great example.</v>

158
00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:27.870
<v Speaker 1>Protectionism has had exactly the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

159
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:36.130
<v Speaker 1>That's of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last exports also means less drops,</v>

160
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:38.050
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

161
00:08:38.051 --> 00:08:38.884
<v Speaker 1>it is true that in the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial offshoring has caused us to </v>

162
00:08:42.311 --> 00:08:44.610
<v Speaker 1>lose many jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in a way thanks to this,</v>

163
00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:45.483
<v Speaker 1>countries like China have had an </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to develop and Chinese </v>

164
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:51.400
<v Speaker 1>businesspeople are now eager to invest </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States,</v>

165
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.323
<v Speaker 1>seeing it as a safe place to make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment in 2016 Chinese companies </v>

166
00:08:56.011 --> 00:08:56.844
<v Speaker 1>invested at $50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars in the US and today </v>

167
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.144
<v Speaker 1>these companies have employed directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and indirectly more than a hundred and </v>

168
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.614
<v Speaker 1>48,000 Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's nine times more than they were </v>

169
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:07.944
<v Speaker 1>employing in 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is indeed the case of this </v>

170
00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:13.530
<v Speaker 1>businessman Mr Wang man who spent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>

171
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:18.490
<v Speaker 1>$700,000,000 restoring a factory that </v>
<v Speaker 1>General Motors had closed down.</v>

172
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:19.493
<v Speaker 2>Hi.</v>

173
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.300
<v Speaker 1>And it isn't just Chinese companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in every five Americans is currently</v>

174
00:09:26.301 --> 00:09:28.540
<v Speaker 1>working for foreign companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And remember,</v>

175
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.383
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never have been so many people working </v>

176
00:09:31.461 --> 00:09:32.294
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the story of globalization being </v>

177
00:09:34.731 --> 00:09:36.290
<v Speaker 1>effected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>destroying our economies.</v>

178
00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:37.153
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like it's just that it's a </v>

179
00:09:38.481 --> 00:09:43.481
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Prints are stealing our jobs.</v>

180
00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:48.680
<v Speaker 2>You will</v>

181
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.050
<v Speaker 1>note that this is one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>issues for people,</v>

182
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.560
<v Speaker 1>especially in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're taking our jobs,</v>

183
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.260
<v Speaker 1>they're taking our manufacturing jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're taking our money,</v>

184
00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:59.450
<v Speaker 1>they're killing us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump.</v>

185
00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.500
<v Speaker 1>That is what trump has been saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that the facts tell a</v>

186
00:10:03.501 --> 00:10:05.840
<v Speaker 1>completely different story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

187
00:10:05.841 --> 00:10:06.674
<v Speaker 1>in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States got six Nobel prizes </v>

188
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:11.900
<v Speaker 1>in science and economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them were awarded to immigrants.</v>

189
00:10:11.901 --> 00:10:12.734
<v Speaker 1>People born in a different country that </v>
<v Speaker 1>now work at universities in the US and </v>

190
00:10:16.851 --> 00:10:17.684
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They tend to be more inclined towards </v>

191
00:10:18.861 --> 00:10:19.694
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so even though immigration accounts for </v>

192
00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.033
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of the workforce in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants are involved in creating one </v>

193
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:29.660
<v Speaker 1>out of every three new companies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US,</v>

194
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:32.780
<v Speaker 1>and those companies are the ones that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are creating the most jobs.</v>

195
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.940
<v Speaker 1>And look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two types of immigrants.</v>

196
00:10:34.941 --> 00:10:37.160
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've got the illegal immigrants.</v>

197
00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.080
<v Speaker 1>They usually work in more physical jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the jobs Americans don't usually once</v>

198
00:10:41.081 --> 00:10:43.130
<v Speaker 1>and on the other hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have legal immigrants.</v>

199
00:10:43.190 --> 00:10:45.710
<v Speaker 1>Half of these immigrants have higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>education.</v>

200
00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:49.700
<v Speaker 1>This is a percentage far higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>people born in the US.</v>

201
00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.593
<v Speaker 1>This type of immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it provides vital brainpower to a </v>

202
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:53.744
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something that countries </v>

203
00:10:54.771 --> 00:10:55.604
<v Speaker 1>desperately meat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also have an entrepreneurial </v>

204
00:10:57.441 --> 00:11:01.640
<v Speaker 1>spirits and many of them are responsible</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many successful projects.</v>

205
00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Procter and gamble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs,</v>

209
00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:09.290

211
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:11.683
<v Speaker 1>Amazon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or even apple or some of the many </v>

212
00:11:12.891 --> 00:11:13.724
<v Speaker 1>companies founded or co founded by </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or the children of </v>

213
00:11:16.101 --> 00:11:16.934
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So hopefully you can see that the best </v>

214
00:11:18.681 --> 00:11:22.820
<v Speaker 1>thing about immigration is that not only</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it not steal jobs from Americans,</v>

215
00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:23.803
<v Speaker 1>it actually creates more jobs for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's a lot of legends when it </v>

216
00:11:27.111 --> 00:11:29.480
<v Speaker 1>comes to predicting the future of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyles,</v>

217
00:11:29.481 --> 00:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that the facts simply</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't live up to the fear.</v>

218
