00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:11.400
<v Speaker 2>have you ever asked yourself,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the best countries live in?</v>

3
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:12.263
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we want to know which country that </v>

4
00:00:13.201 --> 00:00:15.090
<v Speaker 2>is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we usually tend to look at the country's</v>

5
00:00:15.091 --> 00:00:15.924
<v Speaker 2>GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but however important and relevant this </v>

6
00:00:18.421 --> 00:00:21.450
<v Speaker 2>indicator might be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does have certain limitations.</v>

7
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.250
<v Speaker 2>See this statistic is too wide and it </v>
<v Speaker 2>can hide the influence of bubbles,</v>

8
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.123
<v Speaker 2>the actions of dishonest politicians and</v>
<v Speaker 2>is more complex issues like accounting </v>

9
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:31.404
<v Speaker 2>for the online economy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is true though that wealth and </v>

10
00:00:33.301 --> 00:00:37.830
<v Speaker 2>comfort are closely related to the GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is not an exact correlation.</v>

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.380
<v Speaker 2>Let me explain.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could be analyzing a country that has</v>

12
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:41.214
<v Speaker 2>a higher GDP per capita than another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the last occurs have a better </v>

13
00:00:44.251 --> 00:00:45.084
<v Speaker 2>welfare system despite having that lower</v>
<v Speaker 2>GDP and there are also other factors to </v>

14
00:00:50.221 --> 00:00:51.054
<v Speaker 2>consider that not strictly economic but </v>
<v Speaker 2>also affects the social wellbeing of </v>

15
00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:56.800
<v Speaker 2>people of such as security and freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

16
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.643
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so probably know something you thinking </v>

17
00:00:58.561 --> 00:00:59.394
<v Speaker 2>right now and that's that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well do these things or result from </v>

18
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.070
<v Speaker 2>having a higher GDP anyway?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.170
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they kind of do,</v>

20
00:01:04.171 --> 00:01:05.004
<v Speaker 2>but it usually takes awhile before any </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this can be seen in terms of numbers </v>

21
00:01:08.401 --> 00:01:09.960
<v Speaker 2>and statistics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

22
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 2>if you look at Kuwait GDP per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's definitely higher than Germany's.</v>

23
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.453
<v Speaker 2>If given the choice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most people would probably rather live </v>

24
00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:17.124
<v Speaker 2>in the latter.</v>

25
00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.250
<v Speaker 2>It's also more likely that Germany is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be involved in complex and high</v>

26
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:27.150
<v Speaker 2>added value activities like creating </v>
<v Speaker 2>patents and innovative companies.</v>

27
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.220
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] it might become richer,</v>

28
00:01:29.221 --> 00:01:33.030
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time Germany might be </v>
<v Speaker 2>taking better advantage of its wealth in</v>

29
00:01:33.031 --> 00:01:35.280
<v Speaker 2>order to produce welfare,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sustainable wealth,</v>

30
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.173
<v Speaker 2>technology and knowledge and most people</v>
<v Speaker 2>would regard doing that as a pretty </v>

31
00:01:39.511 --> 00:01:41.940
<v Speaker 2>sensible decision and this whole </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated thing.</v>

32
00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:42.774
<v Speaker 2>That's why they're on new indicators to </v>
<v Speaker 2>try to make a more accurate </v>

33
00:01:45.511 --> 00:01:49.590
<v Speaker 2>approximation so that we can work out </v>
<v Speaker 2>the prosperity and comforts of different</v>

34
00:01:49.591 --> 00:01:50.424
<v Speaker 2>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them is the famous [inaudible] </v>

35
00:01:51.501 --> 00:01:52.334
<v Speaker 2>gotten prosperity index.</v>
<v Speaker 2>National success is about far more than </v>

36
00:01:55.621 --> 00:01:58.260
<v Speaker 2>just GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is about a healthy and happy life,</v>

37
00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.590
<v Speaker 2>a good education for our children,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a clean and protected environment,</v>

38
00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.513
<v Speaker 2>family and communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can rely on a safe place to live up </v>

39
00:02:05.101 --> 00:02:07.200
<v Speaker 2>to unity's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>to start a business or get ahead and the</v>

40
00:02:07.201 --> 00:02:10.260
<v Speaker 2>freedom to be who we want to be.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is true prosperity.</v>

41
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.020
<v Speaker 2>And you know what's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least according to these rankings,</v>

42
00:02:13.021 --> 00:02:16.140
<v Speaker 2>the most prosperous nation on earth is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

43
00:02:16.141 --> 00:02:21.141
<v Speaker 2>that would be New Zealand's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperous country.</v>

44
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:27.210
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

45
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.043
<v Speaker 2>Trying to get a deeper knowledge of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>prosperity of the country beyond the </v>

46
00:02:30.631 --> 00:02:31.464
<v Speaker 2>GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The GOSSAN prosperity index considers </v>

47
00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.190
<v Speaker 2>tons of different factors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>economics,</v>

48
00:02:35.191 --> 00:02:36.330
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>
<v Speaker 2>civil liberties,</v>

49
00:02:36.331 --> 00:02:38.700
<v Speaker 2>government education environments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Honestly,</v>

50
00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:41.700
<v Speaker 2>every aspects that accounts for quality </v>
<v Speaker 2>of life in a country.</v>

51
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.010
<v Speaker 2>So in the latest ranking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the results,</v>

52
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.930
<v Speaker 2>it was pretty clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nowadays,</v>

53
00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.793
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand's the land of the Kiwi is </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most prosperous country on the </v>

54
00:02:49.861 --> 00:02:53.130
<v Speaker 2>planet as honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this wasn't really much of a surprise.</v>

55
00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.240
<v Speaker 2>And He Zealand's has taken this position</v>
<v Speaker 2>six times in the last 10 years.</v>

56
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.260
<v Speaker 2>Not Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

57
00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:02.613
<v Speaker 2>And now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are the countries New Zealand is </v>

58
00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:07.980
<v Speaker 2>competing with in order to win the crown</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the best country on earth.</v>

59
00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you wouldn't be surprised to find at the</v>

60
00:03:09.871 --> 00:03:11.880
<v Speaker 2>top of the list countries like Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Finland,</v>

61
00:03:11.881 --> 00:03:14.160
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada or Australia,</v>

62
00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.340
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty tough competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I should also mention at this point that</v>

63
00:03:17.341 --> 00:03:21.270
<v Speaker 2>soon enough we're going to be explaining</v>
<v Speaker 2>on this channel how New Zealand achieved</v>

64
00:03:21.271 --> 00:03:24.750
<v Speaker 2>so much of this after so much crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you want to catch that video,</v>

65
00:03:24.751 --> 00:03:26.940
<v Speaker 2>be sure to subscribe to this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for now,</v>

66
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.840
<v Speaker 2>let's move on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

67
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.860
<v Speaker 2>if you think New Zealand is just ranks </v>
<v Speaker 2>number one for this indicator,</v>

68
00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.250
<v Speaker 2>well you couldn't be more wrong if we </v>
<v Speaker 2>consider the doing business ranking.</v>

69
00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:36.840
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a ranking by the way,</v>

70
00:03:36.841 --> 00:03:37.674
<v Speaker 2>that classifies countries according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>how easy it is to set up a company and </v>

71
00:03:39.871 --> 00:03:40.560
<v Speaker 2>do business.</v>

72
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.393
<v Speaker 2>We can see that New Zealand is also in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the number one spot in the latest </v>

73
00:03:44.611 --> 00:03:49.590
<v Speaker 2>ranking New Zealand dethrone Singapore </v>
<v Speaker 2>as easiest place to do business.</v>

74
00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.860
<v Speaker 2>If we use the index of economic freedom </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the Heritage Foundation,</v>

75
00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:53.723
<v Speaker 2>we will see that New Zealand is in third</v>
<v Speaker 2>position right after a Singapore and </v>

76
00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.780
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then if we use the ranking of the Fraser</v>

77
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:00.613
<v Speaker 2>Institute,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a ranking that considers both economic </v>

78
00:04:01.591 --> 00:04:02.424
<v Speaker 2>and civil freedoms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand's is also in the top three </v>

79
00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.250
<v Speaker 2>just behind Hong Kong and Switzerlands </v>
<v Speaker 2>and if this is not enough for you as you</v>

80
00:04:08.251 --> 00:04:09.084
<v Speaker 2>want more specific information,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can also tell you that New Zealand is </v>

81
00:04:11.491 --> 00:04:15.330
<v Speaker 2>the least corrupt country on earth </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to Transparency International.</v>

82
00:04:15.331 --> 00:04:17.820
<v Speaker 2>This is a position that it shares with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Denmark.</v>

83
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike other countries that we happen to</v>

84
00:04:19.661 --> 00:04:20.494
<v Speaker 2>know very well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is very uncommon for this country's </v>

85
00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:25.050
<v Speaker 2>government to have their hands in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>till.</v>

86
00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.840
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is also one of the safest countries</v>

87
00:04:27.841 --> 00:04:28.674
<v Speaker 2>in the wells as well as being one of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most environmentally friendly and it </v>

88
00:04:31.441 --> 00:04:32.274
<v Speaker 2>also has the all blacks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the best national rugby team on the </v>

89
00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:35.274
<v Speaker 2>planet.</v>

90
00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.113
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>

91
00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.970
<v Speaker 2>but let's move on from the rankings </v>
<v Speaker 2>because honestly we could go on forever.</v>

92
00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:46.070
<v Speaker 2>They do seem to make one thing clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>though,</v>

93
00:04:46.071 --> 00:04:46.904
<v Speaker 2>and that is that on paper New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it sure does look like one of the best </v>

94
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:51.200
<v Speaker 2>places in the world to live.</v>

95
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.870
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:56.180
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here is a surprising fact about alto.</v>

97
00:04:56.181 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 2>Rob,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as it said in Maori,</v>

98
00:04:57.711 --> 00:04:58.544
<v Speaker 2>which is an official language that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand is a really proud of the </v>

99
00:05:01.011 --> 00:05:01.844
<v Speaker 2>Maori culture and it's the integration </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these Polynesian people that the </v>

100
00:05:04.401 --> 00:05:06.410
<v Speaker 2>British pounds when they arrived on </v>
<v Speaker 2>these islands,</v>

101
00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.940
<v Speaker 2>it is true no matter where you go,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Maori culture is present.</v>

102
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:11.813
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

103
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.670
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so moving on,</v>

104
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:14.713
<v Speaker 2>on the 23rd of September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 elections took place in this </v>

105
00:05:18.021 --> 00:05:18.854
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

106
00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:22.473
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

107
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.730
<v Speaker 2>a record election.</v>

108
00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.823
<v Speaker 2>The first thing we need to remember is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that New Zealand is a constitutional </v>

109
00:05:29.261 --> 00:05:30.160
<v Speaker 2>monarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's right,</v>

110
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.073
<v Speaker 2>Elizabeth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second is still the queen of this </v>

111
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:32.944
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's really just a symbolic </v>

112
00:05:34.271 --> 00:05:37.120
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>God Save the Queen in New Zealand,</v>

113
00:05:37.121 --> 00:05:37.954
<v Speaker 2>the government is elected by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parliaments and the term it lasts for </v>

114
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.470
<v Speaker 2>three years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Further,</v>

115
00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:44.470
<v Speaker 2>when New Zealand is go to vote,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to vote twice.</v>

116
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.920
<v Speaker 2>One of the votes goes to a single </v>
<v Speaker 2>candidates from one political party.</v>

117
00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:49.890
<v Speaker 2>This will complete eight parts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parliaments.</v>

118
00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.840
<v Speaker 2>The other vote goes to an NP who will </v>
<v Speaker 2>represent their districts.</v>

119
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:53.703
<v Speaker 2>So as we sat on the 23rd of September,</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand's a held an election and it </v>

120
00:05:56.531 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 2>was a clear for the National Party of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill English.</v>

121
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>Bill English already was the prime </v>
<v Speaker 2>minister by the way,</v>

122
00:06:08.631 --> 00:06:09.464
<v Speaker 2>since the resignation of Junky in </v>
<v Speaker 2>December of 2016 we also going to talk </v>

123
00:06:13.251 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>about this former prime minister in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>upcoming video.</v>

124
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>please do hit that subscribe button.</v>

125
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.930
<v Speaker 2>So this victory for the national posse,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well it was historic in a way,</v>

126
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.823
<v Speaker 2>and this was for two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First because this party had never got </v>

127
00:06:24.111 --> 00:06:24.944
<v Speaker 2>so many votes in an election and seconds</v>
<v Speaker 2>because if the new government is </v>

128
00:06:27.831 --> 00:06:28.664
<v Speaker 2>confirmed for the National Party would </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been in power since 2008 for the </v>

129
00:06:31.611 --> 00:06:36.350
<v Speaker 2>longest period in office for a party in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand for more than 50 years.</v>

130
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:37.273
<v Speaker 2>And truth be told,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are plenty of reasons why bill </v>

131
00:06:39.081 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>English one as we have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country is in great shape.</v>

132
00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.453
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is going through one of the best </v>

133
00:06:44.691 --> 00:06:47.180
<v Speaker 2>moments in its history.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The economy is growing,</v>

134
00:06:47.181 --> 00:06:51.750
<v Speaker 2>unemployment is higher than the average </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the unemployment is pretty scarce.</v>

135
00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:53.970
<v Speaker 2>Plus they also have healthy public </v>
<v Speaker 2>finances.</v>

136
00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.020
<v Speaker 2>Mr. English is eight years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His finance minister,</v>

137
00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.943
<v Speaker 2>unemployment fell.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The budget return to a surplus and New </v>

138
00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.440
<v Speaker 2>Zealand enjoyed one of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>growth rates in the developed world.</v>

139
00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.333
<v Speaker 2>The National Party's intention is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>continue with the politics that they've </v>

140
00:07:07.291 --> 00:07:08.124
<v Speaker 2>carried out since 2008 and that's more </v>
<v Speaker 2>trade balanced budgets and also trying </v>

141
00:07:11.731 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 2>to keep immigration rates higher than </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever.</v>

142
00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.800
<v Speaker 2>This has actually been a very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>aspect of their political campaign.</v>

143
00:07:16.801 --> 00:07:17.940
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it's not broken,</v>

144
00:07:17.941 --> 00:07:18.774
<v Speaker 2>don't fix it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>181,000 jobs have been created in the </v>

145
00:07:21.991 --> 00:07:26.580
<v Speaker 2>last two years and the average annual </v>
<v Speaker 2>wage is up $13,000 under national.</v>

146
00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:27.473
<v Speaker 2>Someone working on the minimum wage has </v>
<v Speaker 2>seen their annual income go up $8,000 </v>

147
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:33.870
<v Speaker 2>since 2008 Bill English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite this,</v>

148
00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:37.020
<v Speaker 2>all the campaign hasn't been as </v>
<v Speaker 2>comfortable as some expected.</v>

149
00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:39.180
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even in the most prosperous country,</v>

150
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.730
<v Speaker 2>there are challenges and unresolved </v>
<v Speaker 2>issues.</v>

151
00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:48.110
<v Speaker 2>Mamia and challenges</v>

152
00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:53.400
<v Speaker 2>just into done was elected leader of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Labour Party policy.</v>

153
00:07:53.401 --> 00:07:55.560
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't exactly going through its best</v>
<v Speaker 2>moments.</v>

154
00:07:55.590 --> 00:08:00.420
<v Speaker 2>In the elections of 2014 the Labour </v>
<v Speaker 2>party barely gone to 25% of the vote,</v>

155
00:08:00.450 --> 00:08:02.940
<v Speaker 2>about half the votes of Junkies National</v>
<v Speaker 2>Party.</v>

156
00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:03.803
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>shortly after they choose a new leader </v>

157
00:08:05.071 --> 00:08:07.050
<v Speaker 2>who was only 37 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

158
00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:09.360
<v Speaker 2>things that things started to change,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the press,</v>

159
00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.280
<v Speaker 2>they call this just sinned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A mania.</v>

160
00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:12.833
<v Speaker 2>Two things have been the keys of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jacinta's campaign housing and </v>

161
00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:16.613
<v Speaker 2>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see one of the problems in New </v>

162
00:08:18.210 --> 00:08:19.043
<v Speaker 2>Zealand is the price of houses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Something that has skyrocketed in the </v>

163
00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:22.673
<v Speaker 2>last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The price of housing has increased much </v>

164
00:08:23.911 --> 00:08:26.880
<v Speaker 2>more than in Australia or Canada or the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States.</v>

165
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand to tops world house price </v>
<v Speaker 2>increase,</v>

166
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:33.960
<v Speaker 2>but why is the price of housing growing </v>
<v Speaker 2>quite so much?</v>

167
00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:35.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's for several reasons,</v>

168
00:08:35.251 --> 00:08:38.130
<v Speaker 2>but there are three main causes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

169
00:08:38.190 --> 00:08:40.890
<v Speaker 2>economy and salaries are increasing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>lot in New Zealand.</v>

170
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:42.930
<v Speaker 2>Second's immigration rates are higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>than ever.</v>

171
00:08:42.990 --> 00:08:43.823
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the countries that </v>
<v Speaker 2>receives the most immigrants every year </v>

172
00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.940
<v Speaker 2>relative to their population and it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>more immigrants.</v>

173
00:08:47.941 --> 00:08:49.050
<v Speaker 2>That means the greater demand.</v>

174
00:08:49.190 --> 00:08:50.023
<v Speaker 1>How's it?</v>

175
00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:57.990
<v Speaker 2>Because many millionaires investors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially from Asia but also from other</v>

176
00:08:57.991 --> 00:08:58.824
<v Speaker 2>parts of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Once a buy houses here to put their </v>

177
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:03.060
<v Speaker 2>money in a safe place and also to enjoy </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country.</v>

178
00:09:03.090 --> 00:09:05.250
<v Speaker 2>One example of these people would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>Jack Mar,</v>

179
00:09:05.251 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 2>the CEO of Alibaba does the National </v>
<v Speaker 2>Party.</v>

180
00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:11.430
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to tackle this issue by </v>
<v Speaker 2>making construction easy and fast.</v>

181
00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 2>The Labor Party have just Endura done </v>
<v Speaker 2>came up with two suggestions.</v>

182
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.683
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing the number of immigrants by </v>

183
00:09:16.831 --> 00:09:17.664
<v Speaker 2>half and second is preventing foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>investors from buying houses in New </v>

184
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.073
<v Speaker 2>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was this speech on Housing and </v>

185
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:28.610
<v Speaker 2>immigration that got him the support of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Party and Poles.</v>

186
00:09:28.611 --> 00:09:31.850
<v Speaker 2>It seemed to indicate that at times it </v>
<v Speaker 2>was a very close race,</v>

187
00:09:31.851 --> 00:09:33.890
<v Speaker 2>but once the election's arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kiwis,</v>

188
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.450
<v Speaker 2>well they did not hesitate.</v>

189
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

190
00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.130
<v Speaker 2>let's be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>New Zealand,</v>

191
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.993
<v Speaker 2>it's a great country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does have some obstacles to </v>

192
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:44.544
<v Speaker 2>overcome housing and proving Mallory </v>
<v Speaker 2>integration and technical education are </v>

193
00:09:47.641 --> 00:09:50.010
<v Speaker 2>a few of these things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in the grand scheme of things,</v>

194
00:09:50.011 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 2>they're pretty small problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to discuss some of these</v>

195
00:09:52.561 --> 00:09:54.030
<v Speaker 2>problems in a future video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but for now,</v>

196
00:09:54.031 --> 00:09:54.864
<v Speaker 2>New Zealanders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can enjoy some of the best living </v>

197
00:09:56.401 --> 00:09:58.860
<v Speaker 2>standards in the wells anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it's your turn.</v>

198
00:09:58.890 --> 00:10:01.950
<v Speaker 2>We'd love to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would you like to spend some time in New</v>

199
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.783
<v Speaker 2>Zealand?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think of the country as a </v>

200
00:10:03.001 --> 00:10:03.601
<v Speaker 2>whole?</v>
