1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you could buy stocks in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your uncle's farm and guess I know that </v>

2
00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:06.450
<v Speaker 1>assumes that your uncle has a farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say it's a small farm,</v>

3
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:07.284
<v Speaker 1>it's got some cows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc. And you can buy stocks from his </v>

4
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.783
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something you would do on the stock </v>

5
00:00:16.491 --> 00:00:17.324
<v Speaker 1>market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you deal with big companies </v>

6
00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:19.640
<v Speaker 1>like apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>exxon,</v>

7
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.440
<v Speaker 1>or chevron thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm crAzy.</v>

8
00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.303
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm not at all and at the end </v>

9
00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.480
<v Speaker 1>of this video you're going to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly where I'm coming from.</v>

10
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.630
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you want to start a company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a traditional company.</v>

11
00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.523
<v Speaker 1>Let's stick to the example of California</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to produce milk and other </v>

12
00:00:40.381 --> 00:00:43.620
<v Speaker 1>dairy products.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the first thing that you need?</v>

13
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:45.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that's going to be money.</v>

14
00:00:45.451 --> 00:00:46.284
<v Speaker 1>You need money to buy the property.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The facilities as well as the all </v>

15
00:00:48.961 --> 00:00:53.961
<v Speaker 1>important was so where can you get the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to do this?</v>

16
00:00:55.431 --> 00:00:56.264
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first option of course is going to </v>

17
00:00:57.291 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>be to go to the bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this has a whole bunch of issues.</v>

18
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.730
<v Speaker 1>The first one is that if it wasn't risky</v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to start your own company,</v>

19
00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:09.440
<v Speaker 1>having a loan makes it even more risky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You could end up bankrupt and in debt.</v>

20
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:10.423
<v Speaker 1>Besides then there's the whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the bank have might actually not </v>

21
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:15.080
<v Speaker 1>give you that loan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've ever tried to get a loan start</v>

22
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:17.240
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know exactly what I'm talking about.</v>

23
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.480
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty hard to convince a banker to</v>
<v Speaker 1>lend you any money.</v>

24
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>So let's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

25
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.933
<v Speaker 1>disregard of a bank option.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next alternative is a venture </v>

26
00:01:25.881 --> 00:01:26.714
<v Speaker 1>capitalist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know those guys out in silicon </v>

27
00:01:28.401 --> 00:01:29.234
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These people were the loads of cash and </v>

28
00:01:30.441 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>a willingness to invest in young talents</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like you.</v>

29
00:01:33.591 --> 00:01:36.650
<v Speaker 1>I mean who knows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a small farm might become the next</v>

30
00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.513
<v Speaker 1>industry been off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then you run into the problem that </v>

31
00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.530
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't know any venture </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalists,</v>

32
00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:47.900
<v Speaker 1>especially if you're somewhere like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of India.</v>

33
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.360
<v Speaker 1>so there's no banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's new venture capitalists,</v>

34
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:52.790
<v Speaker 1>but maybe a parents are rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they're not,</v>

35
00:01:52.791 --> 00:01:53.624
<v Speaker 1>well I guess that's not any help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just hold on for a minute because I </v>

36
00:01:56.481 --> 00:02:00.710
<v Speaker 1>think I have an idea what if you could </v>
<v Speaker 1>already entered the stock market,</v>

37
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like wall street where general</v>

38
00:02:07.431 --> 00:02:11.330
<v Speaker 1>motors and mcdonald's operate the good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and now the stock market is,</v>

39
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>you don't need to know a millionaire to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get funding.</v>

40
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.290
<v Speaker 1>There aren't thousands of small </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors out there who buy stocks every</v>

41
00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.123
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's say you divide your company </v>

42
00:02:20.061 --> 00:02:20.894
<v Speaker 1>into 10,000 stocks in each of them has </v>
<v Speaker 1>an initial price of $10 and people no </v>

43
00:02:25.971 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 1>matter where they live can buy those </v>
<v Speaker 1>shares.</v>

44
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.913
<v Speaker 1>Say maybe there's a guy in Kansas who </v>
<v Speaker 1>buys one stock in the zero women in </v>

45
00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:37.150
<v Speaker 1>France.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He buys 10 this way with no contacts and</v>

46
00:02:37.151 --> 00:02:39.820
<v Speaker 1>no bank loans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can get the funding you need.</v>

47
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.910
<v Speaker 1>You just need a good idea and a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard work,</v>

48
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.953
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

49
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:47.190
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

50
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:48.680
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't get too excited.</v>

51
00:02:48.681 --> 00:02:50.810
<v Speaker 1>There's a pretty major problem here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

52
00:02:50.811 --> 00:02:53.270
<v Speaker 1>if you want to get into the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock exchange,</v>

53
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:54.104
<v Speaker 1>your company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it should have already made at least </v>

54
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.380
<v Speaker 1>$10,000,000 in the last three years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's just the beginning.</v>

55
00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>There are lots and lots of regulations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you have to meet.</v>

56
00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the situation that the guys from</v>

57
00:03:04.961 --> 00:03:05.794
<v Speaker 1>hako sky agricultural company we're in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they lived in Russia and they wanted to </v>

58
00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:11.080
<v Speaker 1>start a cow farm and they had no money </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

59
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think they did?</v>

60
00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:13.593
<v Speaker 1>Well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check it out.</v>

61
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.373
<v Speaker 1>back to coco skier agricultural company </v>
<v Speaker 1>plans to launch an ico named milk coin </v>

62
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>to fund a dairy farm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

63
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.053
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These farmers launch their own </v>

64
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.253
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basically their own version of </v>

65
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.343
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They advertised it on their website and </v>

66
00:03:31.671 --> 00:03:32.504
<v Speaker 1>launched the offer of these new coins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we call an initial coin </v>

67
00:03:36.351 --> 00:03:39.290
<v Speaker 1>offering or ico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

68
00:03:39.291 --> 00:03:40.124
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would I buy another cryptocurrency </v>

69
00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.113
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin enough?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might just think that you're </v>

70
00:03:44.511 --> 00:03:46.610
<v Speaker 1>just buying some sort of virtual coin </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

71
00:03:46.611 --> 00:03:47.444
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is you're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying stocks and you're doing it </v>

72
00:03:49.821 --> 00:03:52.450
<v Speaker 1>without going through the traditional </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock markets.</v>

73
00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:53.313
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you what happens with </v>

74
00:03:54.711 --> 00:03:55.544
<v Speaker 1>this company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is they're not the only </v>

75
00:03:57.381 --> 00:03:58.214
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>

76
00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:05.360
<v Speaker 1>Forty eight percent of those were </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful last year,</v>

77
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:09.560
<v Speaker 1>but startups still managEd to raise five</v>
<v Speaker 1>point $6,000,000,000.</v>

78
00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:10.391
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have.</v>

79
00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:11.224
<v Speaker 1>That appears to be a brand new way of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting money to start a company and </v>

80
00:04:13.761 --> 00:04:14.594
<v Speaker 1>it's available for everybody right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a minute because not </v>

81
00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.450
<v Speaker 1>everything is a beautiful and as you can</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>

82
00:04:20.451 --> 00:04:21.284
<v Speaker 1>these icrs seem like a scam as paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is can we really trust </v>

83
00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.600
<v Speaker 1>this brand new way of starting companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>and what does Switzerland and have to do</v>

84
00:04:29.601 --> 00:04:30.434
<v Speaker 1>with all of this today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to answer all of these </v>

85
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:33.530
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do as usual,</v>

86
00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:38.560
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>coins versus tokens.</v>

87
00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.023
<v Speaker 1>In the year 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone in the tech industry was </v>

88
00:04:42.951 --> 00:04:45.860
<v Speaker 1>already pretty aware of bitcoin in </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley.</v>

89
00:04:45.861 --> 00:04:46.694
<v Speaker 1>They were celebrating all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>events and talking about the future of </v>

90
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.534
<v Speaker 1>this currency.</v>

91
00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:53.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

92
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:57.160
<v Speaker 1>In one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a man called j dot r with it.</v>

93
00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:58.083
<v Speaker 1>This man had a very funny idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said we could create alternative </v>

94
00:05:00.851 --> 00:05:01.684
<v Speaker 1>currencies that using the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology as bitcoin would have </v>

95
00:05:04.241 --> 00:05:06.910
<v Speaker 1>different rules and how are you going to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay all the itv,</v>

96
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.770
<v Speaker 1>but he would design all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They asked him,</v>

97
00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.890
<v Speaker 1>he said that instead of looking for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture capitalist,</v>

98
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.933
<v Speaker 1>he could sell some notes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we call a token that will be </v>

99
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:17.680
<v Speaker 1>exchanged for coins,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swamps.</v>

100
00:05:17.681 --> 00:05:18.514
<v Speaker 1>They were created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is how the first initial Coin </v>

101
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.810
<v Speaker 1>offering was created,</v>

102
00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.990
<v Speaker 2>but before</v>

103
00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>we continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of you might be wondering,</v>

104
00:05:29.061 --> 00:05:30.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is a token?</v>

105
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:31.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tokens are any elements that can be </v>

106
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 1>changed in a blockchain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cryptocurrencies are one kind of token,</v>

107
00:05:37.191 --> 00:05:39.050
<v Speaker 1>but there are many more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

108
00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:41.660
<v Speaker 1>we have those that give a right to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>owner.</v>

109
00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.523
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those notes that you could exchange for </v>

110
00:05:44.061 --> 00:05:46.130
<v Speaker 1>brand new currencies when they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>

111
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:50.793
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the tokens that are based on an </v>

112
00:05:52.841 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>asset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be the case,</v>

113
00:05:54.371 --> 00:05:55.204
<v Speaker 1>so if the stocks at the russian farmers </v>
<v Speaker 1>having one of their tokens means having </v>

114
00:05:58.581 --> 00:05:59.414
<v Speaker 1>a share of their company visit initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>public offering of tokens became </v>

115
00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:06.200
<v Speaker 1>fashionable in the year 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why was that?</v>

116
00:06:06.201 --> 00:06:08.450
<v Speaker 1>What exactly happens In this year?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:06:08.451 --> 00:06:12.770
<v Speaker 1>that was the year when the second most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous cryptocurrency was created.</v>

118
00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:21.020
<v Speaker 3>The decentralized platform that might </v>
<v Speaker 3>displace today's institutions.</v>

119
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:24.400
<v Speaker 1>Unlike bitcoin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know who is behind a theory.</v>

120
00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.820
<v Speaker 1>This is a company that offers way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a cryptocurrency.</v>

121
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.743
<v Speaker 1>They also offer a system so other people</v>
<v Speaker 1>can create their own cryptocurrency </v>

122
00:06:32.091 --> 00:06:34.090
<v Speaker 1>isn't in their own tokens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example.</v>

123
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:34.924
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember this other video where I</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you about how a spanish bank is </v>

124
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:40.000
<v Speaker 1>using blockchains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>give corporate loans?</v>

125
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:40.893
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if theory in is the platform that they </v>

126
00:06:42.281 --> 00:06:43.114
<v Speaker 1>use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are only talking about spanish banks </v>

127
00:06:45.071 --> 00:06:45.904
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory has made it really easy for </v>

128
00:06:47.201 --> 00:06:50.980
<v Speaker 1>lots of people to start creating </v>
<v Speaker 1>different financial products on</v>

129
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:52.253
<v Speaker 4>chain</v>

130
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.613
<v Speaker 3>theory and rush has been unleashed.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Isis ceos are in fashion in the tech </v>

131
00:06:59.431 --> 00:07:00.300
<v Speaker 3>investment world.</v>

132
00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.193
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of companies are getting financed </v>

133
00:07:03.121 --> 00:07:04.260
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

134
00:07:04.261 --> 00:07:05.094
<v Speaker 1>serum labs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a swiss company that is about to launch </v>

135
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:09.990
<v Speaker 1>their own smartphone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company has got more than a hundred</v>

136
00:07:09.991 --> 00:07:14.991
<v Speaker 1>and $18,000,000 thanks to one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most successful ice a's in history,</v>

137
00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:16.313
<v Speaker 1>and of course there are all kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>internet companies that have been born </v>

138
00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.543
<v Speaker 1>with this system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a second because not </v>

139
00:07:22.321 --> 00:07:23.154
<v Speaker 1>everything is so great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ico is they've got no regulation </v>

140
00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.143
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you can certainly imagine there are </v>

141
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:30.960
<v Speaker 1>some problems.</v>

142
00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:36.370
<v Speaker 3>How to create an ico scam in five simple</v>
<v Speaker 3>steps.</v>

143
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

144
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:41.240
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between an ico and</v>
<v Speaker 1>a website like kickstarter?</v>

145
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.280
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's actually pretty easy to onset.</v>

146
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.340
<v Speaker 1>If you support some kickstarter project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can't sell any shares on an ico.</v>

147
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.150
<v Speaker 1>You can buy a token or a coin and if it </v>
<v Speaker 1>rises higher and market value,</v>

148
00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.133
<v Speaker 1>you can sell it to another investor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The only problem is that here there is </v>

149
00:08:02.571 --> 00:08:06.380
<v Speaker 1>no financial police or fcc running </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the bad guys.</v>

150
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:07.243
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were plenty of people who thought </v>

151
00:08:08.031 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>they could get rich really quick and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then ended up losing a ton of money.</v>

152
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:16.823
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saved ride was a german company that </v>

153
00:08:18.481 --> 00:08:21.270
<v Speaker 1>wanted to make a cryptocurrency based </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card.</v>

154
00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:22.313
<v Speaker 1>It has all the buzzwords to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>speculators happy and everything seemed </v>

155
00:08:25.531 --> 00:08:28.620
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The technology Was there and it was very</v>

156
00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:31.200
<v Speaker 1>disruptive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got $50,000,000 to launch it,</v>

157
00:08:31.201 --> 00:08:33.390
<v Speaker 1>so once they got their money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think happens?</v>

158
00:08:33.450 --> 00:08:34.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they just disappeared and since there </v>

159
00:08:35.341 --> 00:08:36.174
<v Speaker 1>was no public register whatsoever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's almost impossible to find the </v>

160
00:08:39.321 --> 00:08:40.154
<v Speaker 1>owner.</v>

161
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:45.213
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've all seen the ads onlIne </v>
<v Speaker 1>for coins and tokens and things that </v>

162
00:08:48.821 --> 00:08:51.760
<v Speaker 1>promise a whole ton of profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for a better understanding,</v>

163
00:08:51.761 --> 00:08:52.594
<v Speaker 1>even the ceo of a theory and butter like</v>
<v Speaker 1>butter and recognized that most of the </v>

164
00:08:56.161 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>ico is a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine.</v>

165
00:08:58.741 --> 00:09:02.130
<v Speaker 1>Governments have already started to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has banned ics.</v>

166
00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 1>America seems to be following a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>path.</v>

167
00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:07.530
<v Speaker 1>Other countries like Estonia said that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's okay to invest in.</v>

168
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Ico is for everyone except estonian </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

169
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 1>so they're essentially saying something </v>
<v Speaker 1>like,</v>

170
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.051
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

171
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:16.290
<v Speaker 1>you can totally scam anyone you like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just not my own citizens.</v>

172
00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:17.220
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

173
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>there is one country that has found an </v>
<v Speaker 1>intermediate solution.</v>

174
00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.420
<v Speaker 1>They weren't banned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ico is,</v>

175
00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:25.170
<v Speaker 1>but they will not let them go </v>
<v Speaker 1>unregulated as they are today.</v>

176
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.790
<v Speaker 1>And what country am I talking about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:27.653
<v Speaker 1>let me give you a clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's probably the channel we've talked </v>

178
00:09:28.781 --> 00:09:32.430
<v Speaker 1>to most about here on visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>already knows.</v>

179
00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.450
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

180
00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:38.480
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about sir,</v>

181
00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:41.633
<v Speaker 1>when the krypto nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During that video we made about </v>

182
00:09:44.791 --> 00:09:48.210
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland there we talked about kansan</v>
<v Speaker 1>called zog,</v>

183
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.250
<v Speaker 1>which has the lowest taxes in the car.</v>

184
00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.970
<v Speaker 1>Well guess what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The theory and has its headquarters.</v>

185
00:09:56.030 --> 00:09:56.863
<v Speaker 1>Having the biggest cryptocurrency </v>
<v Speaker 1>company in your country means that you </v>

186
00:09:59.751 --> 00:10:02.270
<v Speaker 1>also have the biggest experts on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass of that.</v>

187
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:05.690
<v Speaker 1>So most of the ico is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are done on swift service.</v>

188
00:10:05.750 --> 00:10:07.760
<v Speaker 1>And of course the swiss government soon </v>
<v Speaker 1>realize that,</v>

189
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:09.200
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with or without scams,</v>

190
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.350
<v Speaker 1>this was a multi million dollar.</v>

191
00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:12.333
<v Speaker 2>The street</v>

192
00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:18.900
<v Speaker 1>wants to be the world capital of </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrency.</v>

193
00:10:18.990 --> 00:10:22.350
<v Speaker 1>Four of the 10 biggest initial coin </v>
<v Speaker 1>offerings last year.</v>

194
00:10:22.351 --> 00:10:24.810
<v Speaker 1>We're in Switzerland more than any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

195
00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.940
<v Speaker 1>This is why some swiss municipalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>let the citizens pay taxes or even fines</v>

196
00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:31.133
<v Speaker 1>with cryptocurrencies as having less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 30,000 inhabitants is already the </v>

197
00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:35.334
<v Speaker 1>home of 400 blockchain based companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the regional government is already </v>

198
00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:40.524
<v Speaker 1>doing trials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To use this technology to organize </v>

199
00:10:42.271 --> 00:10:43.104
<v Speaker 1>referendums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably already know that </v>

200
00:10:44.521 --> 00:10:49.290
<v Speaker 1>referendums and direct democracy are </v>
<v Speaker 1>essential in the swiss political system,</v>

201
00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:50.213
<v Speaker 1>so well now they want to do it with </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockchain and of course Switzerland </v>

202
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.460
<v Speaker 1>wants to become the pioneer in ico </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations too.</v>

203
00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:03.640
<v Speaker 1>This financial authority releases ico </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific regulatory guidelines.</v>

204
00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.210
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>any company that wants to make an ico in</v>

205
00:11:06.211 --> 00:11:07.044
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to do it through a swiss </v>

206
00:11:08.671 --> 00:11:10.800
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means they will have to regIster,</v>

207
00:11:10.801 --> 00:11:12.780
<v Speaker 1>then have to give their name and </v>
<v Speaker 1>physical address.</v>

208
00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:15.630
<v Speaker 1>This way it will be easier to chase </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>

209
00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:18.090
<v Speaker 1>knockers or scammers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

210
00:11:18.091 --> 00:11:19.430
<v Speaker 1>these regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:23.190
<v Speaker 1>they're starting to work and many </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies have already gone to other tax</v>

212
00:11:23.191 --> 00:11:24.024
<v Speaker 1>havens like the cayman islands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which offer a complete doggy dog </v>

213
00:11:26.881 --> 00:11:29.190
<v Speaker 1>environments where you can essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>do whatever you want.</v>

214
00:11:34.510 --> 00:11:35.343
<v Speaker 1>This is the short term price you have to</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay in order to have a stable </v>

215
00:11:38.471 --> 00:11:39.304
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a wells that still </v>

216
00:11:40.991 --> 00:11:43.990
<v Speaker 1>needs a lot of work before it becomes a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mature market.</v>

217
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.780
<v Speaker 1>One thing is for sure it has pLenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>possibilities.</v>

218
00:11:46.810 --> 00:11:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Many scams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of money laundering and some easy </v>

219
00:11:49.571 --> 00:11:50.404
<v Speaker 1>money to be made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the swiss way seems to be the </v>

220
00:11:52.391 --> 00:11:55.360
<v Speaker 1>smartest far yes and new technology has </v>
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>

221
00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:58.390
<v Speaker 1>It is risky,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has many possibilities to instead</v>

222
00:11:58.391 --> 00:12:01.090
<v Speaker 1>of banning us or letting it run </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely free,</v>

223
00:12:01.091 --> 00:12:01.924
<v Speaker 1>the best option is to regulate it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way we take the good and to avoid </v>

224
00:12:05.141 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>the bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

225
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>going all the way back to our russian </v>
