1
00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and 17 is coming to an end </v>
<v Speaker 1>and just before the year ends,</v>

2
00:00:07.471 --> 00:00:08.304
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to say a big thank you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone here at visual politic for </v>

3
00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>joining us each and every week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

4
00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:13.914
<v Speaker 1>having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to end this year with what we </v>

5
00:00:15.391 --> 00:00:18.570
<v Speaker 1>hope will be the start of a tradition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So without further ado,</v>

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.630
<v Speaker 1>here are the 2017 visual politic awards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

7
00:00:30.731 --> 00:00:31.564
<v Speaker 1>just a quick note it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided to give out four awards </v>

8
00:00:33.581 --> 00:00:36.310
<v Speaker 1>because there are four of us here at </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>

9
00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.130
<v Speaker 1>It's like let's get into the.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Due to his growing leadership and strong</v>

10
00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:39.964
<v Speaker 1>offensive civil rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the visual politic awards is for </v>

11
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.910
<v Speaker 1>Justin Trudeau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi everyone.</v>

12
00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.943
<v Speaker 1>I'm Justin Trudeau.</v>

13
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.013
<v Speaker 1>They denied the Canadian prime minister </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been one of the great protagonists </v>

14
00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.963
<v Speaker 1>of 2017 and did we can say that it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a particularly busy year for </v>

15
00:01:02.601 --> 00:01:03.434
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a year in which this young politician </v>

16
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:05.714
<v Speaker 1>has become in the eyes of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something of an anti trump and you're </v>

17
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:10.250
<v Speaker 1>not going to give you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you stay category?</v>

18
00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>Are Fake News,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fake news,</v>

19
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.093
<v Speaker 1>fake news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are the enemy of the people this </v>

20
00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.870
<v Speaker 1>morning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey,</v>

21
00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.920
<v Speaker 1>we have respect for journalists in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

22
00:01:21.921 --> 00:01:25.760
<v Speaker 1>They asked tough questions and they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to stay in the last 12 months.</v>

23
00:01:25.761 --> 00:01:28.910
<v Speaker 1>His actions in the field of human rights</v>
<v Speaker 1>have been quite extensive,</v>

24
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>so how about we look at some examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

25
00:01:30.891 --> 00:01:33.920
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister kicks off the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the welcome to Canada campaign,</v>

26
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.060
<v Speaker 1>which aims to welcome refugees and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say that he's really succeeded and</v>

27
00:01:38.061 --> 00:01:38.894
<v Speaker 1>he's made the European Union look bad at</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time because of that lack of </v>

28
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:42.290
<v Speaker 1>commitments on the issue.</v>

29
00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.083
<v Speaker 2>In recent months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadians have opened their hearts and </v>

30
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:50.774
<v Speaker 2>their arms to families fleeing the </v>
<v Speaker 2>ongoing conflict in Syria and from the </v>

31
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:55.364
<v Speaker 2>moment they arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those 31,000 refugees were welcomed not </v>

32
00:01:59.151 --> 00:01:59.984
<v Speaker 2>as burdens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as neighbors and friends as new </v>

33
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Canadians</v>

34
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also gave honorary citizenship Canada</v>

35
00:02:07.701 --> 00:02:10.340
<v Speaker 1>to the Nobel Peace Prize winner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malala Yousafzai,</v>

36
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.850
<v Speaker 1>a Pakistani activist who fights for </v>
<v Speaker 1>women's rights and who has been brutally</v>

37
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:14.684
<v Speaker 1>persecution and attacked by the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has also worked as hard as we saw in </v>

38
00:02:17.841 --> 00:02:18.674
<v Speaker 1>the video on this channel on is </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration and recognition of the </v>

39
00:02:20.961 --> 00:02:23.660
<v Speaker 1>indigenous people in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and last but not least,</v>

40
00:02:23.661 --> 00:02:26.150
<v Speaker 1>in a historic speech you made before </v>
<v Speaker 1>parliament last November,</v>

41
00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.343
<v Speaker 1>officially apologized on behalf of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal government for the repression </v>

42
00:02:30.081 --> 00:02:30.914
<v Speaker 1>that the government's exercised against </v>
<v Speaker 1>members of the lgbt community until the </v>

43
00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:34.210
<v Speaker 1>nineties.</v>

44
00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.110
<v Speaker 3>We were wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We apologize.</v>

45
00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.720
<v Speaker 3>I am sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We are sorry,</v>

46
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.740
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

47
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:59.740
<v Speaker 1>that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This year,</v>

48
00:02:59.751 --> 00:03:00.584
<v Speaker 1>today's government has also reaffirmed </v>
<v Speaker 1>its intention to legalize the </v>

49
00:03:03.441 --> 00:03:04.274
<v Speaker 1>recreational use of marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has also announced that the </v>

50
00:03:05.991 --> 00:03:09.170
<v Speaker 1>government will increase its number of </v>
<v Speaker 1>residency permits so that new immigrants</v>

51
00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.570
<v Speaker 1>to the country in search of a better </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

52
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:12.463
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's not much more you could ask for </v>

53
00:03:13.181 --> 00:03:13.560
<v Speaker 1>in a single.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:14.393
<v Speaker 3>yeah.</v>

55
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:19.690
<v Speaker 1>Some of you might not be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:03:19.691 --> 00:03:20.440
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

57
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:21.880
<v Speaker 1>There's lots of civil rights stuff </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed it,</v>

58
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 1>but couldn't this just be a distraction </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the state of their economy,</v>

59
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.740
<v Speaker 1>which really isn't working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:03:26.741 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because in matters of economy,</v>

61
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.460
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually looking at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>

62
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.353
<v Speaker 1>The Canadian economy expects to close </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 with three percent growth and it's </v>

63
00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>the lowest unemployment rates in 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

64
00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 1>Along these same lines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2017,</v>

65
00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.783
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau ratified his free trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement with the European Union is </v>

66
00:03:41.981 --> 00:03:44.890
<v Speaker 1>also set his sights on Asia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially China.</v>

67
00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.070
<v Speaker 1>China will soon be the largest market in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

68
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.380
<v Speaker 1>It's home to 1 billion potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers for the high quality goods and</v>

69
00:03:53.381 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>services that Canadians deliver every </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

70
00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.350
<v Speaker 1>It's true that things are going slower </v>
<v Speaker 1>than expected,</v>

71
00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:00.184
<v Speaker 1>but even so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a very good chance that Canada </v>

72
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:02.254
<v Speaker 1>will end up becoming a great bridge </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the American and Chinese </v>

73
00:04:04.691 --> 00:04:07.920
<v Speaker 1>economies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

74
00:04:07.921 --> 00:04:08.754
<v Speaker 1>that is right folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while we may not completely agree </v>

75
00:04:10.501 --> 00:04:11.334
<v Speaker 1>with Justin Trudeau's agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do think that he is contributing to </v>

76
00:04:13.951 --> 00:04:16.800
<v Speaker 1>the construction of a better world for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

77
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>So from all of us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congratulations Justin.</v>

78
00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:31.290
<v Speaker 1>The next visual holistic award is for </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting when the president of Taiwan</v>

79
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.243
<v Speaker 1>price is a bit special in somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>different because with we won't </v>

80
00:04:44.321 --> 00:04:48.580
<v Speaker 1>recognize political success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather the ability to resist.</v>

81
00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:53.180
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We decided to give this award to sighing</v>

82
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:54.023
<v Speaker 1>Wang for two main reasons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first for being the first female </v>

83
00:04:56.081 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 1>president of Taiwan and for being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>symbol to other East Asian societies.</v>

84
00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.513
<v Speaker 1>I think the young people are generally </v>
<v Speaker 1>excited about this idea of hugging a </v>

85
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:04.624
<v Speaker 1>woman to lead the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I thought it was rather trending second </v>

86
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:09.303
<v Speaker 1>for her from will to defense Taiwan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and freedom in the face of </v>

87
00:05:12.371 --> 00:05:13.204
<v Speaker 1>Beijing's desire for reunification </v>
<v Speaker 1>because let's not forget that this </v>

88
00:05:15.551 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>country has one of the most flourishing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and alive democracies in the region,</v>

89
00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:21.310
<v Speaker 1>and China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you may know,</v>

90
00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.180
<v Speaker 1>is a dictator</v>

91
00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.700
<v Speaker 3>to share</v>

92
00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.670
<v Speaker 1>2017 has been a difficult year for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands and for its presidents.</v>

93
00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:37.150
<v Speaker 1>China has unleashed a political and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic war against Taiwan,</v>

94
00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>the likes of which has not been seen for</v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

95
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.623
<v Speaker 1>There's all resulted in presidents size,</v>
<v Speaker 1>refusal to commit to the so called 1992 </v>

96
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:47.660
<v Speaker 1>consensus and agreement under which </v>
<v Speaker 1>China is recognized as a single mom.</v>

97
00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:56.323
<v Speaker 1>And of course if is clear it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all this economic and political </v>

98
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>pressure poses a huge problem for this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

99
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.940
<v Speaker 1>Forty percent of its exports currently </v>
<v Speaker 1>depends on mainland</v>

100
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:04.833
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

101
00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.260
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewer fall from surrendering,</v>

102
00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.113
<v Speaker 1>citing when this government has </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforced it's political strategy to </v>

103
00:06:12.741 --> 00:06:15.050
<v Speaker 1>sync and consolidate alternatives to </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

104
00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.080
<v Speaker 1>mainly opening the Southeast Asian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian,</v>

105
00:06:18.081 --> 00:06:18.914
<v Speaker 1>and New Zealand markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is known as the new southbound </v>

106
00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:27.280
<v Speaker 1>policy and so far the results have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty good.</v>

107
00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:28.153
<v Speaker 1>Trade with these countries is growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly at rates of seven percent at </v>

108
00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:31.553
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Taiwanese economy is also regained some </v>

109
00:06:32.661 --> 00:06:35.390
<v Speaker 1>vigor and investors have regained </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidence in this country.</v>

110
00:06:37.890 --> 00:06:41.850
<v Speaker 1>This has resulted in quite a bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure on China so well even though we</v>

111
00:06:41.851 --> 00:06:43.080
<v Speaker 1>don't like some of the things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

112
00:06:43.081 --> 00:06:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Governments such as their slowness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when facing reforms,</v>

113
00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:50.070
<v Speaker 1>we really believe that their spirits of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resistance to Chinese pressure justifies</v>

114
00:06:50.071 --> 00:06:50.904
<v Speaker 1>this truck.</v>

115
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 3>Yep.</v>

116
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Fiction with Beijing may not be most </v>
<v Speaker 1>convenient for the islands interests,</v>

117
00:06:59.950 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>but I think we need to make two things </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

118
00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about resistance,</v>

119
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about protecting one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most democratic and liberal regimes </v>

120
00:07:06.771 --> 00:07:07.604
<v Speaker 1>in Asia and seconds according to polls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This policy is clearly backed by </v>

121
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:12.374
<v Speaker 1>Taiwanese society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Due to all of this in when gets one of </v>

122
00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:20.201
<v Speaker 1>this year's visual political wards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's continue and this next award,</v>

123
00:07:25.751 --> 00:07:28.900
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just go to one politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it goes to an entire political party</v>

124
00:07:30.670 --> 00:07:32.540
<v Speaker 1>and this would be the check pirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties</v>

125
00:07:36.910 --> 00:07:37.743
<v Speaker 4>zero,</v>

126
00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:42.490
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.500
<v Speaker 1>why are we giving this award to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>check pirate?</v>

128
00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:48.653
<v Speaker 1>Because they came in third in the track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>parliamentary elections that occurred </v>

129
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:51.614
<v Speaker 1>this year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being the second most voted for pirate </v>

130
00:07:53.451 --> 00:07:56.390
<v Speaker 1>party on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only surpassed by the Icelandic pirate</v>

131
00:07:56.430 --> 00:07:57.263
<v Speaker 3>posy</v>

132
00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.860
<v Speaker 1>to be answered here is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

133
00:08:01.861 --> 00:08:04.980
<v Speaker 1>what does the Pirate Party stands for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wealthy pirates ideology,</v>

134
00:08:04.981 --> 00:08:06.690
<v Speaker 1>or as they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pirate movements.</v>

135
00:08:06.691 --> 00:08:09.150
<v Speaker 1>There was born in Sweden in the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>2005.</v>

136
00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:12.720
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to protect online privacy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to reform copyright laws.</v>

137
00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>This is why they're called the pirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>party according to them.</v>

138
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:16.253
<v Speaker 1>Copyright laws are needless barriers for</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs can only help big </v>

139
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.803
<v Speaker 1>corporations.</v>

140
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.963
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

141
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.080
<v Speaker 1>so just hold on a second year because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>know what you're thinking now.</v>

142
00:08:27.100 --> 00:08:27.933
<v Speaker 1>Does this mean that we add visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic are against copyright and </v>

143
00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Intellectual Property Law?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:35.160
<v Speaker 1>far from it because the truth is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the pirate movements,</v>

145
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:39.030
<v Speaker 1>it has changed a lot since 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now their manifesto covers far more than</v>

146
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:41.260
<v Speaker 1>what it started with from economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy.</v>

147
00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.010
<v Speaker 3>See,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there's</v>

148
00:08:44.030 --> 00:08:46.730
<v Speaker 1>now a big difference between the pirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties in different countries.</v>

149
00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.593
<v Speaker 1>Just like a Swedish social democrat is </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally different from a Spanish Social </v>

150
00:08:50.750 --> 00:08:51.583
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and Icelandic pirate is seldom</v>
<v Speaker 1>similar to a check pirate so well did </v>

151
00:08:55.291 --> 00:09:00.291
<v Speaker 1>the check pirate stand for first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tech lovers as they are,</v>

152
00:09:02.161 --> 00:09:05.900
<v Speaker 1>they want to implement e-government </v>
<v Speaker 1>solutions in the same vein as Estonia.</v>

153
00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>It really makes absolutely no sense that</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in the 21st century,</v>

154
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:09.954
<v Speaker 1>you need to wait in line for more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>four hours in an administrative office </v>

155
00:09:12.241 --> 00:09:14.670
<v Speaker 1>in order to report that you changed your</v>
<v Speaker 1>residence.</v>

156
00:09:14.700 --> 00:09:18.420
<v Speaker 1>This happens today in the Czech Republic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and because I live here,</v>

157
00:09:18.421 --> 00:09:23.421
<v Speaker 1>this is something I've had to do and it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is an enormous pain in the ass and isn't</v>

158
00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.740
<v Speaker 1>this kind of bureaucracy madness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is not only time consuming,</v>

159
00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:30.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's also a big share of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's budget is stonier has saved</v>

160
00:09:30.791 --> 00:09:31.624
<v Speaker 1>millions thanks to these reforms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they should be a model for other </v>

161
00:09:34.211 --> 00:09:36.760
<v Speaker 1>countries plus the check pirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They stand for freedom of movement,</v>

162
00:09:36.761 --> 00:09:39.040
<v Speaker 1>freedom of speech and fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility.</v>

163
00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:41.770
<v Speaker 1>During their campaign,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they avoided the temptation of promising</v>

164
00:09:41.771 --> 00:09:42.604
<v Speaker 1>more spending or giving grants to anyone</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was especially alluring in an </v>

165
00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:50.140
<v Speaker 1>election full of populist candidates and</v>
<v Speaker 1>on top of all that,</v>

166
00:09:50.210 --> 00:09:51.430
<v Speaker 1>all the ones that legalize weed</v>

167
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:55.753
<v Speaker 1>with this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the check pirates came in third in one </v>

168
00:09:57.591 --> 00:10:00.500
<v Speaker 1>of the Czech Republic's most notable </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections in history.</v>

169
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:04.520
<v Speaker 1>Usually in most countries that are two </v>
<v Speaker 1>or three main political forces,</v>

170
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.330
<v Speaker 1>but not anymore in the Czech Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First place went to Anodea lip and their</v>

171
00:10:08.340 --> 00:10:09.173
<v Speaker 1>leader Andre Babish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he only obtained the less than 30 </v>

172
00:10:11.571 --> 00:10:12.404
<v Speaker 1>percent of the vote after him is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sense of rights ods party who made up </v>

173
00:10:15.321 --> 00:10:18.800
<v Speaker 1>the little more than 10 percent below </v>
<v Speaker 1>those with almost the same percentage.</v>

174
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:23.840
<v Speaker 1>There aren't pirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the virus,</v>

175
00:10:24.601 --> 00:10:25.434
<v Speaker 1>the past,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other charismatic and radical </v>

176
00:10:26.251 --> 00:10:28.750
<v Speaker 1>politicians like the communist party and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Tom,</v>

177
00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:31.260
<v Speaker 1>Joachim Mira and anti immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>

178
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:32.393
<v Speaker 1>Just as a funny note,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr Nakamura is actually originally from </v>

179
00:10:35.401 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when walking around Prague,</v>

180
00:10:39.610 --> 00:10:40.443
<v Speaker 1>during the elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could see a big picture of a </v>

181
00:10:41.561 --> 00:10:44.380
<v Speaker 1>Japanese dude which says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say no to immigration.</v>

182
00:10:44.470 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 1>It was actually pretty funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

183
00:10:46.541 --> 00:10:47.374
<v Speaker 1>the check pirates have obtained </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising results with a solid and </v>

184
00:10:49.751 --> 00:10:52.570
<v Speaker 1>rational manifesto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of their proposals certainly better</v>

185
00:10:52.571 --> 00:10:53.710
<v Speaker 1>than others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in general,</v>

186
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.840
<v Speaker 1>they deserve our applause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sire criteria.</v>

187
00:10:55.860 --> 00:11:00.860
<v Speaker 1>Lemon nosheen Paretsky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last but not least,</v>

188
00:11:02.921 --> 00:11:03.754
<v Speaker 1>the fourth award,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because he couldn't be left out of this </v>

189
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:06.250
<v Speaker 1>list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>goes to</v>

190
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.060
<v Speaker 5>Emmanuel macron make our planet.</v>

191
00:11:18.700 --> 00:11:19.533
<v Speaker 1>You said that Mr Macron,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's one of the biggest surprises of </v>

192
00:11:21.551 --> 00:11:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

193
00:11:22.421 --> 00:11:25.300
<v Speaker 1>you had to create his own political </v>
<v Speaker 1>party from zero.</v>

194
00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:26.350
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

195
00:11:26.351 --> 00:11:27.184
<v Speaker 1>He started his political career as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>finance minister in the social </v>

196
00:11:29.561 --> 00:11:30.394
<v Speaker 1>democratic government of manual valves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he was not affiliated with that </v>

197
00:11:33.521 --> 00:11:35.240
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was an independent.</v>

198
00:11:35.241 --> 00:11:38.020
<v Speaker 1>It's hard because of his achievements </v>
<v Speaker 1>working in the finance industry.</v>

199
00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:38.953
<v Speaker 5>I want France to be a thought that </v>
<v Speaker 5>nation meaning both a nation is that we </v>

200
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:45.743
<v Speaker 5>end for the startups,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but also a nation that thinks and moves </v>

201
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 5>like a and make</v>

202
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:56.800
<v Speaker 1>no mistake here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has not had an easy job.</v>

203
00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:00.580
<v Speaker 1>France has been in crisis for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said in this other video.</v>

204
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:03.070
<v Speaker 1>The country used to be one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's biggest economies,</v>

205
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:06.550
<v Speaker 1>but now it's companies find it hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete in the international markets.</v>

206
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.400
<v Speaker 1>Part of this is due to the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>

207
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:10.960
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

208
00:12:10.961 --> 00:12:11.794
<v Speaker 1>fully the ideology of Charles de Gaulle </v>
<v Speaker 1>man who led the country's economy as if </v>

209
00:12:14.531 --> 00:12:15.364
<v Speaker 1>it was an army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The goal was obsessed with protecting </v>

210
00:12:21.311 --> 00:12:22.144
<v Speaker 1>French companies from the outside world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the world is different today and </v>

211
00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:30.340
<v Speaker 1>macron wants a 180 degree shift from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this French economic theory.</v>

212
00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:38.390
<v Speaker 1>His manifesto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was solid and it was rational.</v>

213
00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:42.050
<v Speaker 1>He didn't promise any of those things </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are impossible to achieve once you</v>

214
00:12:42.051 --> 00:12:45.800
<v Speaker 1>are in office and despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you won by a landslide victory.</v>

215
00:12:45.801 --> 00:12:47.780
<v Speaker 1>And that's not only in the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections,</v>

216
00:12:47.781 --> 00:12:51.320
<v Speaker 1>but the parliamentary ones too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if this wasn't impressive enough,</v>

217
00:12:51.380 --> 00:12:52.213
<v Speaker 1>he also did it against Marine Le Pen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the champion of European populism prior </v>

218
00:12:55.851 --> 00:12:56.684
<v Speaker 1>to the foundation of Mr macrons party or</v>
<v Speaker 1>marsh pollsters said Le Pen had the </v>

219
00:13:00.591 --> 00:13:03.980
<v Speaker 1>victory guaranteed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But macron prove them wrong.</v>

220
00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Now we just asked him not to disappoint </v>
<v Speaker 1>us in 2018.</v>

221
00:13:07.460 --> 00:13:09.380
<v Speaker 1>And in the meantime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulations.</v>

222
00:13:09.381 --> 00:13:10.214
<v Speaker 1>And annual.</v>

223
00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:12.253
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

224
00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.430
<v Speaker 1>These were the 2017 visual political </v>
<v Speaker 1>wards.</v>

225
00:13:15.431 --> 00:13:17.770
<v Speaker 1>I hope you enjoyed them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And just before I say goodbye today,</v>

226
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:18.663
