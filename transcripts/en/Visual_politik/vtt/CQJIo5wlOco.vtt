1
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.120
<v Speaker 1>This is a great place to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what Donald Trump said,</v>

2
00:00:12.121 --> 00:00:12.954
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>referring to the White House in early </v>

3
00:00:14.131 --> 00:00:17.580
<v Speaker 1>March of 2018 hours before his chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic advisor,</v>

4
00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.020
<v Speaker 1>Gary Cohn's resignation became public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Gary Cohen's last meeting.</v>

5
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.920
<v Speaker 1>He's going to go out and make another </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple of hundred dollars,</v>

6
00:00:24.921 --> 00:00:25.754
<v Speaker 1>million and</v>

7
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.413
<v Speaker 2>back</v>

8
00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.930
<v Speaker 1>all the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This phrase,</v>

9
00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:37.570
<v Speaker 1>would it have been specially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't have called anybody's attention</v>

10
00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:38.463
<v Speaker 1>after all the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I don't think this will surprise </v>

11
00:00:40.811 --> 00:00:43.180
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the most sought after places</v>

12
00:00:43.181 --> 00:00:44.014
<v Speaker 1>to work in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having a job in the president's team </v>

13
00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.730
<v Speaker 1>means power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and recognition.</v>

14
00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:49.623
<v Speaker 1>However way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the moments because we are </v>

15
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:51.874
<v Speaker 1>forgetting a very important detail and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that detail would be who the president </v>

16
00:00:55.601 --> 00:00:56.434
<v Speaker 1>is and how he is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you know this well in the trump </v>

17
00:00:58.661 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 1>dictionary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the term usually has no place.</v>

18
00:01:01.151 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 1>It simply does not exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up in the west wing</v>

20
00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.150
<v Speaker 1>in January of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 23 most important people in the west</v>

21
00:01:19.151 --> 00:01:22.540
<v Speaker 1>wing of the White House were sworn in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the people who would make up the</v>

22
00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.060
<v Speaker 1>team that would lie or closest to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>

23
00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.740
<v Speaker 1>the chief of staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>press secretary,</v>

24
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.530
<v Speaker 1>National Security Advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>director of communications,</v>

25
00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.300
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Etc.</v>

26
00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.193
<v Speaker 1>That is all of those people that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>normally see next to the president's on </v>

27
00:01:34.601 --> 00:01:36.640
<v Speaker 1>tv shows and movies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of coursE,</v>

28
00:01:36.641 --> 00:01:38.770
<v Speaker 1>dev you have president trump isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

29
00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:39.633
<v Speaker 1>Bartlet and surviving and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration is becoming more </v>

30
00:01:41.441 --> 00:01:44.310
<v Speaker 1>difficult than setting up a business in </v>
<v Speaker 1>nicolas maduro.</v>

31
00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

32
00:01:45.581 --> 00:01:46.414
<v Speaker 1>waiT a minute,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe you don't know who president </v>

33
00:01:47.321 --> 00:01:48.820
<v Speaker 1>josiah bartlet is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

34
00:01:48.821 --> 00:01:50.320
<v Speaker 1>maybe I haven't seen the west wing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:50.321 --> 00:01:52.000
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case and you like </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

36
00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:53.710
<v Speaker 1>which you probably do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're watching this channel.</v>

37
00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.560
<v Speaker 1>Don't waste another minute and go check </v>
<v Speaker 1>out that show,</v>

38
00:01:56.561 --> 00:01:57.394
<v Speaker 1>but let's stay on track here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to donald trump's white </v>

39
00:02:00.431 --> 00:02:01.264
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>

40
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.953
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess how many of those 23 </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who formed the president's </v>

41
00:02:13.271 --> 00:02:16.720
<v Speaker 1>praetorian guard when his term began are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still in office to date?</v>

42
00:02:16.721 --> 00:02:18.850
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>out of those 23,</v>

43
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.010
<v Speaker 1>only nine are still in their post.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam's.</v>

44
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:23.560
<v Speaker 1>Many of those nine are on the chopping </v>
<v Speaker 1>block.</v>

45
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might be thinking,</v>

46
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:27.130
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe he didn't choose the right.</v>

47
00:02:27.131 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean anyone can make a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

48
00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.290
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that that is not the </v>
<v Speaker 1>case.</v>

49
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.710
<v Speaker 1>A tall Katherine Dunn 10 per se,</v>
<v Speaker 1>researcher at the brookings institute,</v>

50
00:02:35.711 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important think tanks in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington is following the changes that</v>

51
00:02:39.911 --> 00:02:40.744
<v Speaker 1>are taking place almost every week in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the president's executive office and </v>

52
00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:44.644
<v Speaker 1>listen to it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we take all the appointed positions </v>

53
00:02:47.081 --> 00:02:49.330
<v Speaker 1>into accounts and those you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>replaced,</v>

54
00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.193
<v Speaker 1>dismissed or resigned as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who worked for them in total </v>

55
00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.733
<v Speaker 1>until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>65 people have been passed of the </v>

56
00:02:55.571 --> 00:03:00.571
<v Speaker 1>president's office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is a eight percenT turnoVer rate.</v>

57
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.983
<v Speaker 1>That means that in just over a year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of the people who were part of the </v>

58
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:06.520
<v Speaker 1>team and no longer in office,</v>

59
00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:07.383
<v Speaker 3>yes,</v>

60
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.460
<v Speaker 1>an unprecedented rotation race,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the scandals,</v>

61
00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:16.370
<v Speaker 1>disagreements with the president or </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply the oval office tenants,</v>

62
00:03:16.371 --> 00:03:17.204
<v Speaker 1>mood swings have led to working in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west wing becoming a high risk </v>

63
00:03:19.701 --> 00:03:20.534
<v Speaker 1>profession.</v>

64
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.020
<v Speaker 1>TO give you an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>layoffs,</v>

65
00:03:31.021 --> 00:03:31.854
<v Speaker 1>resignations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and changes are happening at a speed </v>

66
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.373
<v Speaker 1>three times greater than in the obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration and two times greater </v>

67
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:38.124
<v Speaker 1>than in reagan's suit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You still hold the record and we're </v>

68
00:03:39.751 --> 00:03:42.690
<v Speaker 1>really not inflating this by just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about small posts.</v>

69
00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.553
<v Speaker 1>In the last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has replaceD two press </v>

70
00:03:44.551 --> 00:03:47.160
<v Speaker 1>secretaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two chiefs of staff to national security</v>

71
00:03:47.161 --> 00:03:47.994
<v Speaker 1>advisors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and five different people have been </v>

72
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:52.500
<v Speaker 1>appointed as director of communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this time,</v>

73
00:03:52.501 --> 00:03:53.334
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump has even fired as lawyers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and what's worse based on the available </v>

74
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:57.624
<v Speaker 1>information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things seem to be heading in an even </v>

75
00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:00.630
<v Speaker 1>worse direction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

76
00:04:00.631 --> 00:04:01.464
<v Speaker 1>the national security advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>general mcmaster hasn't just been fired </v>

77
00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.980
<v Speaker 1>since everything points to the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>the general John Kelly has current chief</v>

78
00:04:07.981 --> 00:04:11.190
<v Speaker 1>of staff will follow in his footsteps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a very short time,</v>

79
00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.390
<v Speaker 1>trump has decided to remove his national</v>
<v Speaker 1>security advisor.</v>

80
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:16.283
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump chooses them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then he seems to change his mind </v>

81
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:20.430
<v Speaker 1>really quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So with this scenario in mind,</v>

82
00:04:20.431 --> 00:04:22.650
<v Speaker 1>so we can understand why many of us team</v>
<v Speaker 1>members,</v>

83
00:04:22.651 --> 00:04:23.484
<v Speaker 1>based on what they confessed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spends a great deal of time trying not </v>

84
00:04:26.161 --> 00:04:28.230
<v Speaker 1>to provoke a presidents who gets angry </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

85
00:04:28.231 --> 00:04:29.070
<v Speaker 1>very easily.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

86
00:04:29.071 --> 00:04:29.904
<v Speaker 1>many people would probably imagine trump</v>
<v Speaker 1>walking the halls of the white house </v>

87
00:04:31.681 --> 00:04:32.514
<v Speaker 1>saying to people that you have five,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but maybe this isn't actually that far </v>

88
00:04:34.741 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>from the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

89
00:04:35.581 --> 00:04:38.610
<v Speaker 1>it does seem as if trump took his </v>
<v Speaker 1>position on the apprentice to hot,</v>

90
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.040
<v Speaker 1>where he basically fired people every </v>
<v Speaker 1>week.</v>

91
00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:43.760
<v Speaker 4>You're fired,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fired,</v>

92
00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:45.290
<v Speaker 4>bradford,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you're fired.</v>

93
00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.500
<v Speaker 4>Can I say it as a joke sometimes that </v>
<v Speaker 4>derek,</v>

94
00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.930
<v Speaker 4>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fired.</v>

95
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.040
<v Speaker 4>Eight matter yet,</v>
<v Speaker 4>he Better otherwise.</v>

96
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.883
<v Speaker 4>I'll say,</v>
<v Speaker 4>tom,</v>

97
00:04:54.890 --> 00:04:57.830
<v Speaker 4>you're fired.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You're fired.</v>

98
00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.730
<v Speaker 1>Devastating.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No business can handle this much less.</v>

99
00:05:01.731 --> 00:05:02.564
<v Speaker 1>The government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supposed to be about stability and </v>

100
00:05:04.341 --> 00:05:06.920
<v Speaker 1>continuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's just not in his lexicon.</v>

101
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.010
<v Speaker 1>William m daily,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former president barack obama's chief of</v>

102
00:05:10.011 --> 00:05:11.150
<v Speaker 1>staff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but all right,</v>

103
00:05:11.151 --> 00:05:12.470
<v Speaker 1>so you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

104
00:05:12.471 --> 00:05:15.950
<v Speaker 1>what's really going on here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are there so many changes?</v>

105
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are many reasons.</v>

106
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:23.273
<v Speaker 1>So on the fence and leave due to </v>
<v Speaker 1>scandals such as the national security </v>

107
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:28.170
<v Speaker 1>advisor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michael Flynn or staff secretary,</v>

108
00:05:28.171 --> 00:05:29.004
<v Speaker 1>rob porter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who resigned after domestic abuse </v>

109
00:05:30.601 --> 00:05:31.434
<v Speaker 1>allegations</v>

110
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 5>today,</v>
<v Speaker 5>former national security advisor,</v>

111
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.704
<v Speaker 5>Michael Flynn,</v>
<v Speaker 5>appeared in federal court and pleaded </v>

112
00:05:37.091 --> 00:05:37.924
<v Speaker 5>guilty to lying to the fbi about his </v>
<v Speaker 5>conversations with russia's ambassador </v>

113
00:05:40.991 --> 00:05:42.670
<v Speaker 5>during the transition last december.</v>

114
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:43.623
<v Speaker 1>Staff secretary rob porter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who announced his resignation yesterday </v>

115
00:05:46.661 --> 00:05:50.320

<v Speaker 1>now officially out.</v>

116
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:54.590
<v Speaker 3>This</v>

117
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:57.650
<v Speaker 1>was also bannon's case until August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

118
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>He was donald trump's right hand man in </v>
<v Speaker 1>his political career,</v>

119
00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:04.280
<v Speaker 1>but not even that saved him known for is</v>
<v Speaker 1>highly nationalist position.</v>

120
00:06:04.281 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Steve bannon was named senior counselor </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the president and chief strategist of</v>

121
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>the white house swell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After a little over six months,</v>

122
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:12.420
<v Speaker 1>trump sided to kick him out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>

123
00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:15.620
<v Speaker 1>bannon stepped forward and submitted a </v>
<v Speaker 1>forced resignation.</v>

124
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:17.743
<v Speaker 1>Others such as the economic advisor runs</v>
<v Speaker 1>former goldman sachs executive gary </v>

125
00:06:21.261 --> 00:06:23.300
<v Speaker 1>cohn,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or press secretary sean spicer,</v>

126
00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:24.160
<v Speaker 1>left.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because of that,</v>

127
00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:26.270
<v Speaker 1>disagreements with the president's many </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

128
00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were directly fired.</v>

129
00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:28.813
<v Speaker 1>Ten days on the job that makes anthony </v>
<v Speaker 1>scaramucci the shortest tenured </v>

130
00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 1>communications director in the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the white house.</v>

131
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 1>Trump's personal assistant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>john mcentee,</v>

132
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:40.070
<v Speaker 1>fired over security issue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there are other cases,</v>

133
00:06:40.071 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>emma amanda goals here until December,</v>

134
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.233
<v Speaker 1>2017 was assistant to the president and </v>
<v Speaker 1>director of communications for the </v>

135
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.260
<v Speaker 1>office of public liaison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

136
00:06:48.261 --> 00:06:51.200
<v Speaker 1>omarosa was basically known for </v>
<v Speaker 1>participating in television.</v>

137
00:06:51.201 --> 00:06:52.034
<v Speaker 1>Reality shows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of which was the apprentice where </v>

138
00:06:53.601 --> 00:06:55.310
<v Speaker 1>she met Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thanks to that,</v>

139
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.520
<v Speaker 1>she became part of the president's team </v>
<v Speaker 1>when he arrived at the white house.</v>

140
00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:03.570
<v Speaker 5>I think I've won every reality tv a war.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's like reality star,</v>

141
00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.780
<v Speaker 5>the year reality villain.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Best catfight,</v>

142
00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:11.140
<v Speaker 5>most dramatic momeNt.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Most google moment.</v>

143
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:12.453
<v Speaker 5>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I was in a field that was driven by </v>

144
00:07:13.901 --> 00:07:16.600
<v Speaker 5>ratings and you know what drives </v>
<v Speaker 5>ratings?</v>

145
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:17.793
<v Speaker 5>conflict.</v>

146
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:20.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in december of 2017,</v>

147
00:07:20.431 --> 00:07:21.264
<v Speaker 1>she suddenly resigned stating that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>seen very strange things that had Made </v>

148
00:07:24.421 --> 00:07:27.360
<v Speaker 1>her feel very uncomfortable and had </v>
<v Speaker 1>effected her emotionally.</v>

149
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:28.233
<v Speaker 1>Omarosa was fired three times on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>apprentice and this was the fourth time </v>

150
00:07:31.981 --> 00:07:32.814
<v Speaker 1>we let her go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you know what she did after </v>

151
00:07:34.051 --> 00:07:35.010
<v Speaker 1>resigning?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

152
00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.873
<v Speaker 1>nothing less than joining the celebrity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Big brother show where she has been </v>

153
00:07:38.731 --> 00:07:41.310
<v Speaker 1>entering all that she saw as a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>house employee,</v>

154
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:42.603
<v Speaker 5>haunted my tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>And eVery single day like what is he </v>

155
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:45.394
<v Speaker 5>going to tweak?</v>
<v Speaker 5>You would be worried about pens and </v>

156
00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:50.350
<v Speaker 5>dream.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm christian,</v>

157
00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:51.273
<v Speaker 5>I love jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>But he thinks jesus tells him to say </v>

158
00:07:55.630 --> 00:07:58.930
<v Speaker 5>things like jesus.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I say that.</v>

159
00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.770
<v Speaker 1>So apparently Donald Trump has an </v>
<v Speaker 1>amazing eye for recreating great job.</v>

160
00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:05.970
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>

161
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.800
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now some of you might be thinking,</v>

162
00:08:07.801 --> 00:08:09.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes simon.</v>

163
00:08:09.091 --> 00:08:12.340
<v Speaker 1>The thing with is west wing team has </v>
<v Speaker 1>gotten a bit out of hand,</v>

164
00:08:12.341 --> 00:08:15.090
<v Speaker 1>sparse at the governmental level,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things must be different,</v>

165
00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:15.983
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

166
00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.670
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually seem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

167
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:40.260
<v Speaker 2>The cabiNet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cabinet,</v>

168
00:08:40.290 --> 00:08:42.990
<v Speaker 1>the body that is made up of the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>positions of the us.</v>

169
00:08:42.991 --> 00:08:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Government's hasn't been saved from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump earthquake either.</v>

170
00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:48.270
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in june of 2017,</v>

171
00:08:48.271 --> 00:08:50.460
<v Speaker 1>the first meeting was held with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire cabinet.</v>

172
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:51.323
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump publicly stated that he had </v>

173
00:08:52.561 --> 00:08:55.890
<v Speaker 1>assembled an extraordinary group of </v>
<v Speaker 1>talents to his government.</v>

174
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.240
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to say the least.</v>

175
00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.103
<v Speaker 1>Things have changed since then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There've been six cabinet rotations </v>

176
00:09:02.911 --> 00:09:03.744
<v Speaker 1>that's more than George Bush had in his </v>
<v Speaker 1>two terms in office and it's more than </v>

177
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.193
<v Speaker 1>half the diploma had in a single year of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these exchanges incidentally for were </v>

178
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>redundant dismissals or resignations </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have rains,</v>

179
00:09:13.291 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>priebus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tom price,</v>

180
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:15.790
<v Speaker 1>david shulkin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last time,</v>

181
00:09:15.791 --> 00:09:17.530
<v Speaker 1>the most surreal of that being rex </v>
<v Speaker 1>tillerson,</v>

182
00:09:17.531 --> 00:09:18.364
<v Speaker 1>the secretary of state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and previously powerful ceo of exxon </v>

183
00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:21.684
<v Speaker 1>mobile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest oil company in the United </v>

184
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.151
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rex tillerson,</v>

185
00:09:24.151 --> 00:09:26.150
<v Speaker 1>dvo you might remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was fired through twitter.</v>

186
00:09:26.190 --> 00:09:30.400
<v Speaker 1>Trump didn't even tell them in person.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

187
00:09:30.401 --> 00:09:32.350
<v Speaker 1>it's ruined that skipping the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president's orders,</v>

188
00:09:32.351 --> 00:09:34.660
<v Speaker 1>John Kelly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's chief of staff called tillison,</v>

189
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:35.523
<v Speaker 1>who was touring africa to tell him that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the president was going to kick him out </v>

190
00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.660
<v Speaker 1>and that he needed to return to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington and consider resigning.</v>

191
00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:42.460
<v Speaker 1>It isn't clear whether telus and didn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to,</v>

192
00:09:42.461 --> 00:09:44.350
<v Speaker 1>didn't believe him or didn't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

193
00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.510
<v Speaker 1>but the fact is the trump fired him on </v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter.</v>

194
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:49.663
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rumors about who trump is going to find </v>

195
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:53.740
<v Speaker 1>next are growing like crazy.</v>

<v Speaker 1>presidential elections that led him to </v>

203
00:10:14.241 --> 00:10:15.800
<v Speaker 1>the white house.</v>

<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they thinking?</v>

206
00:10:19.581 --> 00:10:22.910
<v Speaker 1>How can the fbi or the justice </v>
<v Speaker 1>department to try to investigate him?</v>

207
00:10:22.911 --> 00:10:23.744
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how dare they independence will have </v>

<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thank you very much and pay attention </v>

210
00:10:27.891 --> 00:10:29.790

<v Speaker 1>thinking guy.</v>

211
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:30.890
<v Speaker 1>That is why he is fired.</v>

212
00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:33.920
<v Speaker 1>James comey or andrew macabe format fbI </v>
<v Speaker 1>directors,</v>

213
00:10:33.950 --> 00:10:36.200
<v Speaker 1>and for that same reason he stated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Robert Mueller,</v>

214
00:10:36.201 --> 00:10:37.034
<v Speaker 1>the special counsel who's investigating </v>
<v Speaker 1>russia's interference in the elections </v>

215
00:10:39.740 --> 00:10:40.573
<v Speaker 1>is next to be fired.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that even made a </v>

216
00:10:43.071 --> 00:10:43.904
<v Speaker 1>republican senator jeff flake from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arizona publicly warned the presidents </v>

217
00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:48.350
<v Speaker 1>without his possible dismissal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

218
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:49.243
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are begging the president not to </v>

219
00:10:52.311 --> 00:10:55.340
<v Speaker 1>fire the special counsel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't create a constitutional crisis.</v>

220
00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.233
<v Speaker 1>Congress cannot preempt to such a firing</v>
<v Speaker 1>or only constitutional remedy is after </v>

221
00:10:59.571 --> 00:11:02.180
<v Speaker 1>the fact through impeachment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one Wants that outcome.</v>

222
00:11:02.330 --> 00:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Mr. President,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't go there.</v>

223
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Senator jeff flake wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have.</v>

224
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.033
<v Speaker 1>these are the reasons why working in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump administration is becoming less </v>

225
00:11:10.611 --> 00:11:13.190
<v Speaker 1>and less attractive even for </v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans.</v>

226
00:11:13.640 --> 00:11:14.473
<v Speaker 1>There isn't a huge appetite for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>republicans on the outside to explore </v>

227
00:11:17.511 --> 00:11:19.490
<v Speaker 1>job opportunities in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>

228
00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:22.310
<v Speaker 1>Ryan williams,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former spokesmen for mitt romney,</v>

229
00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.233
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you noticed the main consequences </v>

230
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:25.820
<v Speaker 1>of all of this?</v>

231
00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:26.653
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's going to want to work in this </v>

232
00:11:27.591 --> 00:11:28.910
<v Speaker 1>administration now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

233
00:11:28.911 --> 00:11:30.170
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you had a good job,</v>

234
00:11:30.171 --> 00:11:31.004
<v Speaker 1>if you had a good position,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you risk everything's going to </v>

235
00:11:32.770 --> 00:11:33.603
<v Speaker 1>work in the white house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean you could be fired tomorrow and </v>

236
00:11:35.601 --> 00:11:36.434
<v Speaker 1>that would be the ends of your </v>
<v Speaker 1>reputation and your career and maybe </v>

237
00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:42.110
<v Speaker 1>you'd get fired by a tweet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the reality is that for many people,</v>

238
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:45.050
<v Speaker 1>they would just say no to working in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>white house.</v>

239
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:45.943
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the obvious consequence of this is that </v>

240
00:11:47.091 --> 00:11:49.970
<v Speaker 1>the trump administration might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking in talent anyways.</v>

241
00:11:49.971 --> 00:11:51.890
<v Speaker 1>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how things are in Washington.</v>

242
00:11:51.891 --> 00:11:55.540
<v Speaker 1>And now consider that trump only been in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the white house for a single year.</v>

243
00:11:55.570 --> 00:11:56.403
<v Speaker 1>But now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who do you think's next up to be fired </v>

244
00:11:57.851 --> 00:11:58.684
<v Speaker 1>in the white house swelled.</v>
