00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.380
<v Speaker 1>Totally before being fired on twitter at</v>
<v Speaker 1>Secretary of state,</v>

2
00:00:11.381 --> 00:00:13.570
<v Speaker 1>rex Tillerson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the former US diplomat,</v>

3
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:14.463
<v Speaker 1>has concluded his first tour of Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America was the first official trip a </v>

4
00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:30.370
<v Speaker 1>senior officer from the trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration had taken to the region.</v>

5
00:00:30.371 --> 00:00:33.880
<v Speaker 1>Though a few months ago in the summer of</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 the vice president's himself,</v>

6
00:00:33.881 --> 00:00:37.720
<v Speaker 1>Mike Pence had his own Latin American </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk in which he visited Panama,</v>

7
00:00:37.721 --> 00:00:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

8
00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.873
<v Speaker 1>and Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all know that the </v>

9
00:00:45.921 --> 00:00:50.090
<v Speaker 1>relationship between the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Latin America is very,</v>

10
00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:52.760
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>should we say special.</v>

11
00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:53.594
<v Speaker 1>And by special we mean not very good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'm not just saying this because </v>

12
00:00:56.631 --> 00:00:59.720
<v Speaker 1>there are about 60 million Hispanics </v>
<v Speaker 1>living in the United States,</v>

13
00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:01.460
<v Speaker 1>but also because of historical </v>
<v Speaker 1>precedents,</v>

14
00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:03.650
<v Speaker 1>commercial ties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many,</v>

15
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.800
<v Speaker 1>many security issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Without going any further,</v>

16
00:01:12.851 --> 00:01:16.240
<v Speaker 1>one out of every four US trade dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up in this region.</v>

17
00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.103
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vice presidents and the former </v>

18
00:01:17.981 --> 00:01:21.400
<v Speaker 1>secretary of state's toilets left in </v>
<v Speaker 1>many with the feeling in the eyes of the</v>

19
00:01:21.401 --> 00:01:25.090
<v Speaker 1>trump administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America is more of a nuisance than</v>

20
00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:30.091
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this might actually be softening the</v>

21
00:01:31.711 --> 00:01:32.544
<v Speaker 1>blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considering everything that trump has </v>

22
00:01:33.721 --> 00:01:36.510
<v Speaker 1>said since he announced that he would </v>
<v Speaker 1>run four presidents,</v>

23
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.220
<v Speaker 1>when Mexico sends its people,</v>

24
00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.380
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not sending their best no more,</v>

25
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:43.153
<v Speaker 2>no more naps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alan Bray Dead Pedelec when we're going </v>

26
00:01:47.631 --> 00:01:49.660
<v Speaker 2>to build the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have no choice.</v>

27
00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.553
<v Speaker 2>We have no choice</v>

28
00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.510
<v Speaker 1>to describe the relationship between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States and Latin America today.</v>

29
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.373
<v Speaker 1>We could say that the United States is </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like that friend who demands </v>

30
00:01:59.021 --> 00:02:01.570
<v Speaker 1>loads of things from you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But when the situations reversed,</v>

31
00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:02.433
<v Speaker 1>they won't do anything for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A pretty good example of this is the </v>

32
00:02:05.291 --> 00:02:06.124
<v Speaker 1>pretty surreal Mike Pence store.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all that had practically no </v>

33
00:02:09.311 --> 00:02:10.144
<v Speaker 1>objectives and to which the vice </v>
<v Speaker 1>president seemed to be more concerned </v>

34
00:02:12.191 --> 00:02:13.024
<v Speaker 1>with trying to prevent the insignificant</v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial relations between Chile and </v>

35
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:17.224
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe trying to get the origin zines </v>

36
00:02:18.761 --> 00:02:20.890
<v Speaker 1>to buy pork from his State,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indiana.</v>

37
00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.753
<v Speaker 1>He didn't seem to have much of a focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>on actual international relations </v>

38
00:02:24.701 --> 00:02:27.760
<v Speaker 1>between the United States and Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

39
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.630
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I come from an agricultural state in the</v>

40
00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:39.464
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I was governor of the state of Indiana </v>

41
00:02:40.851 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>before I became vice president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>

42
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.880
<v Speaker 1>and um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know the,</v>

43
00:02:45.881 --> 00:02:48.380
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the quality of American pork.</v>

44
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 3>You</v>

45
00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was China,</v>

46
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping's China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

47
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.490
<v Speaker 1>they're on the lookouts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in the video today,</v>

48
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:07.130
<v Speaker 1>we're going to see what he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does Donald Trump expects from mass</v>

49
00:03:07.131 --> 00:03:08.440
<v Speaker 1>in America and also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

50
00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.020
<v Speaker 1>what's happening with China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But first,</v>

51
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.230
<v Speaker 1>let's look back at the history America </v>
<v Speaker 1>for North Americans,</v>

52
00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.560
<v Speaker 1>1823,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the then president of the United States,</v>

53
00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.423
<v Speaker 1>James Monroe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>launched what would later be known as </v>

54
00:03:28.531 --> 00:03:32.060
<v Speaker 1>the Monroe Doctrine America for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans or they,</v>

55
00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:34.470
<v Speaker 1>with time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is become more like America for the</v>

56
00:03:34.471 --> 00:03:35.304
<v Speaker 1>North Americans see this doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this policy defended the claim that the </v>

57
00:03:38.251 --> 00:03:39.084
<v Speaker 1>European states had no right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervene in American affairs or in the </v>

58
00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:45.390
<v Speaker 1>countries that were becoming independent</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the time from Spain.</v>

59
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.450
<v Speaker 1>At that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the U S was protecting Latin America and</v>

60
00:03:48.451 --> 00:03:51.390
<v Speaker 1>defending non-intervention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which sounds pretty good,</v>

61
00:03:51.391 --> 00:03:52.020
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.930
<v Speaker 1>just wait a moment here because that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly a problem.</v>

63
00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:55.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this doctrine led Washington's do </v>

64
00:03:56.971 --> 00:03:57.804
<v Speaker 1>practically everything in Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're a region that has since become </v>

65
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:05.241
<v Speaker 1>known as the u s his back yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>

66
00:04:09.321 --> 00:04:11.600
<v Speaker 1>Since James Monro launched this </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective,</v>

67
00:04:11.601 --> 00:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>the United States has set up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments has overthrown,</v>

68
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:16.820
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has financed gorillas,</v>

69
00:04:16.821 --> 00:04:19.390
<v Speaker 1>has financed armies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has bought politicians,</v>

70
00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.233
<v Speaker 1>has negotiated with drug traffickers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has managed to legitimize q to task and </v>

71
00:04:24.301 --> 00:04:27.560
<v Speaker 1>has committed many more actions aimed at</v>
<v Speaker 1>depending on the time period,</v>

72
00:04:27.561 --> 00:04:28.394
<v Speaker 1>either at fighting communism or </v>
<v Speaker 1>defending other interests such as some </v>

73
00:04:31.641 --> 00:04:36.641
<v Speaker 1>big oil sector multinational now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

74
00:04:41.781 --> 00:04:44.060
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some good things have also been done,</v>

75
00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.160
<v Speaker 1>especially in recent years when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>more,</v>

76
00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:47.023
<v Speaker 1>let's say opaque relations gave way to a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy from Washington that focused </v>

77
00:04:50.901 --> 00:04:53.240
<v Speaker 1>more on resolving internal conflict.</v>

78
00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:54.833
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

79
00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.853
<v Speaker 1>Was the case for example with Bill </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clinton's Columbia plan or George Bush </v>

80
00:05:00.951 --> 00:05:01.784
<v Speaker 1>is trade promotion strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which led him to sign no less than 10 </v>

81
00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:05.713
<v Speaker 1>new free trade agreements with Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>American countries and to even propose </v>

82
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:12.200
<v Speaker 1>for all of America to become a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>free trade area.</v>

83
00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:18.280
<v Speaker 1>They even say relations between Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and the United States.</v>

84
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 1>They've always been very peculiar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

85
00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:22.053
<v Speaker 1>due to the Monroe doctrine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington has always felt like a legal </v>

86
00:05:24.461 --> 00:05:27.070
<v Speaker 1>guardian who can decide what's right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's wrong,</v>

87
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:29.710
<v Speaker 1>what's advisable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Watson not advisable.</v>

88
00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.800
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results haven't been very positive.</v>

89
00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:39.400
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

90
00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:45.790
<v Speaker 1>is it over again now since Donald Trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>entered the white house.</v>

91
00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:50.110
<v Speaker 1>So let's see what the presidents of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States of Latin America wants,</v>

92
00:05:50.111 --> 00:05:52.480
<v Speaker 1>what he expects and what we can expect.</v>

93
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.440
<v Speaker 3>What does Donald Trump want</v>

94
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:06.480
<v Speaker 1>now is not going to surprise anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this video that Donald Trump is</v>

95
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:07.314
<v Speaker 1>not exactly in Latin America's best </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend who seemingly has very little </v>

96
00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.710
<v Speaker 1>concern for the region except Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela and above all,</v>

97
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.080
<v Speaker 1>well Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

98
00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:16.973
<v Speaker 1>trump has so little interest in Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America that one year into his </v>

99
00:06:19.891 --> 00:06:22.050
<v Speaker 1>presidency at the time of making this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

100
00:06:22.051 --> 00:06:22.884
<v Speaker 1>he still hasn't appointed someone for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Assistant Secretary of State for </v>

101
00:06:25.841 --> 00:06:26.674
<v Speaker 1>Western Hispanic Affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the person specifically </v>

102
00:06:29.221 --> 00:06:30.054
<v Speaker 1>responsible for diplomacy with Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America and it's quite unusual that it </v>

103
00:06:32.941 --> 00:06:35.130
<v Speaker 1>hasn't yet appointed anyone to this </v>
<v Speaker 1>position.</v>

104
00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:37.813
<v Speaker 1>That is not to see that his lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest hasn't made the region </v>

105
00:06:40.431 --> 00:06:41.264
<v Speaker 1>something of a play thing for him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nor does it mean that he doesn't expect </v>

106
00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:45.380
<v Speaker 1>anything from them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:45.981
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>

108
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:46.814
<v Speaker 1>let me explain this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's first year has been marked with </v>

109
00:06:49.011 --> 00:06:49.844
<v Speaker 1>insults to Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mostly due to his obsession with </v>

110
00:06:51.561 --> 00:06:53.000
<v Speaker 1>building that wall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

111
00:06:53.001 --> 00:06:56.780
<v Speaker 1>and he's also threatened to Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something we're going to get to</v>

112
00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.810
<v Speaker 1>in a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It may be through reimbursement,</v>

113
00:07:01.851 --> 00:07:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but one way or the other,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico will pay for the world.</v>

114
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:06.580
<v Speaker 4>That wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build that wall,</v>

115
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.460
<v Speaker 4>build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build that wall,</v>

116
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:12.250
<v Speaker 4>build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build that wall,</v>

117
00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 4>build that wall,</v>
<v Speaker 4>build that wall.</v>

118
00:07:15.790 --> 00:07:20.000
<v Speaker 1>I love the Mexican people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have such a great relationship to make</v>

119
00:07:20.001 --> 00:07:24.460
<v Speaker 1>sure I hire thousands people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Rich Mexicans,</v>

120
00:07:24.461 --> 00:07:25.930
<v Speaker 1>they're great people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Friends of mine,</v>

121
00:07:25.931 --> 00:07:27.580
<v Speaker 1>they buy my apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

122
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 1>well how about some more examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now listen to this.</v>

123
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.930
<v Speaker 1>In 2017 as we saw here on visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

124
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.793
<v Speaker 1>trump moved away from Obama's openness </v>
<v Speaker 1>towards Cuba without really proposing </v>

125
00:07:39.911 --> 00:07:40.744
<v Speaker 1>any sort of alternative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also back in the worst customs of </v>

126
00:07:42.731 --> 00:07:43.564
<v Speaker 1>Western diplomacy in Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He legitimized and supported the very </v>

127
00:07:46.361 --> 00:07:47.194
<v Speaker 1>suspicious reelection of one Orlando </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hernandez in Honduras and most recently </v>

128
00:07:53.471 --> 00:07:54.304
<v Speaker 1>in 2018 is government decided to suspend</v>
<v Speaker 1>these so called temporary protected </v>

129
00:07:57.401 --> 00:07:58.234
<v Speaker 1>status for Nicaragua and Honduran </v>
<v Speaker 1>Haitian and above all Salvadoran </v>

130
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listen because with this decision,</v>

131
00:08:03.310 --> 00:08:05.740
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants from El Salvador.</v>

132
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>200,000</v>

133
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:11.230
<v Speaker 1>we'll have to leave the United States or</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply become illegal immigrants.</v>

134
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:12.693
<v Speaker 1>We had hoped that if we worked hard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paid our taxes and didn't get in </v>

135
00:08:15.131 --> 00:08:16.930
<v Speaker 1>trouble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will you be allowed to stay?</v>

136
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.913
<v Speaker 1>Veronica lacunas 39 a Salvadoran who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>two children born in the United States </v>

137
00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:25.570
<v Speaker 1>and these are just a few examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The list is really rather long.</v>

138
00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:28.230
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps that is why trump's popularity </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the region is so,</v>

139
00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:30.160
<v Speaker 1>so low and when we say so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so low,</v>

140
00:08:30.161 --> 00:08:33.400
<v Speaker 1>we really mean it is just totally on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>floor.</v>

141
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:34.943
<v Speaker 1>I mean check it out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2017 Gallup asked Lassen American </v>

142
00:08:37.241 --> 00:08:39.340
<v Speaker 1>citizens for their opinion on president </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>

143
00:08:39.370 --> 00:08:44.370
<v Speaker 1>Only 16% had a positive opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The folks,</v>

144
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.333
<v Speaker 1>here's an important question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question that we really need to ask </v>

145
00:08:48.101 --> 00:08:48.934
<v Speaker 1>ourselves is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does all this offense does all this </v>

146
00:08:51.581 --> 00:08:52.414
<v Speaker 1>poking in the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that trump doesn't want anything </v>

147
00:08:54.671 --> 00:08:57.660
<v Speaker 1>from Latin America and the answer that </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not a tall,</v>

148
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:00.480
<v Speaker 1>his government is demanding several </v>
<v Speaker 1>things from the regions,</v>

149
00:09:00.481 --> 00:09:01.314
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the following three </v>

150
00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.670
<v Speaker 1>unconditional support for his foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>

151
00:09:12.671 --> 00:09:13.504
<v Speaker 1>including his policy on Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds for people to renounce or curb </v>

152
00:09:16.961 --> 00:09:21.010
<v Speaker 1>China's influence and third for them to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the blame for everything.</v>

153
00:09:21.011 --> 00:09:21.844
<v Speaker 1>Either by paying for the wall or by </v>
<v Speaker 1>assuming more responsibilities in the </v>

154
00:09:24.881 --> 00:09:26.920
<v Speaker 1>fight against drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

155
00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:28.380
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Except for China in the world,</v>

156
00:09:28.381 --> 00:09:31.630
<v Speaker 1>the other demands could really be taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>as actually being pretty reasonable.</v>

157
00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:33.160
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what the real problem is</v>

158
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.013
<v Speaker 3>here is</v>

159
00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:43.400
<v Speaker 1>the trump administration never put any </v>
<v Speaker 1>alternatives on the table.</v>

160
00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:44.263
<v Speaker 1>They don't seem very willing to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything in return and they do </v>

161
00:09:46.161 --> 00:09:46.994
<v Speaker 1>everything under the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're either with me or against me </v>

162
00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:49.784
<v Speaker 1>approach.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that if we want Latin </v>

163
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>America to change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>evolve to prosper,</v>

164
00:09:54.050 --> 00:09:56.900
<v Speaker 1>it needs support and it needs </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities.</v>

165
00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.270
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more trade opportunities.</v>

166
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.110
<v Speaker 1>That was another republican president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>George Bush has precise strategy and the</v>

167
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.540
<v Speaker 1>results were actually pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay.</v>

168
00:10:05.570 --> 00:10:06.650
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

169
00:10:06.651 --> 00:10:07.484
<v Speaker 1>come on assignment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Surely trump has also proposed some </v>

170
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:10.970
<v Speaker 1>positive things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

171
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:13.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really think to answer that question,</v>

172
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.570
<v Speaker 1>we need to see how trump is treating the</v>
<v Speaker 1>u s is best allies in the room.</v>

173
00:10:17.740 --> 00:10:22.740
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

174
00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.500
<v Speaker 1>brands</v>

175
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible]</v>

176
00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:33.010
<v Speaker 1>you can say without fear of being wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Colombia,</v>

177
00:10:33.070 --> 00:10:35.470
<v Speaker 1>Honduras and Mexico have traditionally </v>
<v Speaker 1>been,</v>

178
00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:39.430
<v Speaker 1>the u s is best allies in Latin America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>

179
00:10:39.490 --> 00:10:42.100
<v Speaker 1>With trump in the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not really helping very much.</v>

180
00:10:42.130 --> 00:10:42.963
<v Speaker 1>Check out the statements that trump made</v>
<v Speaker 1>by rex tillerson was on tour trying to </v>

181
00:10:45.491 --> 00:10:50.230
<v Speaker 1>strengthen ties with the Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These countries are not our friends.</v>

182
00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:51.093
<v Speaker 1>We think there our friends and we sent </v>
<v Speaker 1>the massive aid and I won't mention </v>

183
00:10:53.621 --> 00:10:54.454
<v Speaker 1>names right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We send them massive aid and they're </v>

184
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:58.360
<v Speaker 1>pouring drugs into our country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're laughing at us.</v>

185
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.830
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

186
00:10:59.831 --> 00:11:01.270
<v Speaker 1>trump.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He doesn't give out any names,</v>

187
00:11:01.271 --> 00:11:03.610
<v Speaker 1>but there's little doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was referring to Mexico,</v>

188
00:11:03.611 --> 00:11:05.080
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras,</v>

189
00:11:05.081 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Speaker 1>and brew in Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He mentioned the wall.</v>

190
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:08.614
<v Speaker 1>He mentioned the Nafta renegotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There have been constant attacks since </v>

191
00:11:11.831 --> 00:11:12.664
<v Speaker 1>trump announced his candidacy and do you</v>
<v Speaker 1>know how people feel about trump in </v>

192
00:11:16.691 --> 00:11:17.261
<v Speaker 1>Mexico?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will,</v>

193
00:11:17.261 --> 00:11:19.240
<v Speaker 1>according to polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's 1.6</v>

194
00:11:19.241 --> 00:11:22.540
<v Speaker 1>points out of 10 does also take a look </v>
<v Speaker 1>now at Columbia,</v>

195
00:11:22.570 --> 00:11:23.403
<v Speaker 1>the country that by far has historically</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the best relationship with the u s </v>

196
00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.290
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it might surprise you,</v>

197
00:11:33.291 --> 00:11:37.250
<v Speaker 1>but Columbia was actually the only Latin</v>
<v Speaker 1>American country that sent troops to the</v>

198
00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:38.083
<v Speaker 1>Korean War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also supported the United States and </v>

199
00:11:39.141 --> 00:11:42.650
<v Speaker 1>the 2003 invasion of Iraq and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's policies.</v>

200
00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.410
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty much always aligned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington's interests.</v>

201
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:47.390
<v Speaker 1>These have been created policies towards</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

202
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:48.283
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

203
00:11:50.980 --> 00:11:51.300
<v Speaker 3>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

204
00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.133
<v Speaker 1>not even that's prevented from </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened ms country by considering it </v>

205
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.103
<v Speaker 1>noncooperative with the fulfillment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>international requirements in the fight </v>

206
00:11:58.931 --> 00:11:59.764
<v Speaker 1>against drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that could have a </v>

207
00:12:01.241 --> 00:12:04.180
<v Speaker 1>serious economic and political </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

208
00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:05.823
<v Speaker 1>It isn't only treating an ally who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to solve the problem in a rude </v>

209
00:12:08.441 --> 00:12:10.480
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a great mistake.</v>

210
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:12.940
<v Speaker 1>He's sending a toxic message to the rest</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the region.</v>

211
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:13.863
<v Speaker 1>Even if you do what the u s asks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they disagree with part of your </v>

212
00:12:16.091 --> 00:12:17.740
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will act against you.</v>

213
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.723
<v Speaker 1>Adam Isaacson coordinator up a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Office for Latin American </v>

214
00:12:21.251 --> 00:12:22.150
<v Speaker 1>affairs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

215
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:23.013
<v Speaker 1>it is true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The coca production has rebounded in </v>

216
00:12:24.851 --> 00:12:25.684
<v Speaker 1>Columbia and that the country hasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been able to beat the drug trafficking </v>

217
00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:31.270
<v Speaker 1>that's threatening the country that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered the most from the war on drugs,</v>

218
00:12:31.271 --> 00:12:34.630
<v Speaker 1>threatening the only country that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to improve the situation.</v>

219
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:35.493
<v Speaker 1>As I mean on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's doing it without proposing any </v>

220
00:12:37.481 --> 00:12:38.314
<v Speaker 1>alternative.</v>

221
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:41.320
<v Speaker 1>We've lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our best leaders are best journalists,</v>

222
00:12:41.350 --> 00:12:44.470
<v Speaker 1>are best judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are best police in the war on drugs.</v>

223
00:12:44.530 --> 00:12:45.363
<v Speaker 1>Juan Manuel Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President of Columbia and is regarding </v>

224
00:12:47.681 --> 00:12:48.514
<v Speaker 1>Honduras and other great ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What we've already told you here on </v>

225
00:12:50.741 --> 00:12:55.210
<v Speaker 1>visual politic about Juan Orlando </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hernandez is very probable q and even in</v>

226
00:12:55.211 --> 00:12:56.044
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country that is rapidly changing </v>

227
00:12:57.311 --> 00:12:59.590
<v Speaker 1>something that Washington should </v>
<v Speaker 1>logically acts upon.</v>

228
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not even acting then.</v>

229
00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:05.230
<v Speaker 1>Trump demands a lot from Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he really isn't willing to give much</v>

230
00:13:05.231 --> 00:13:07.390
<v Speaker 1>in return,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even to the United States,</v>

231
00:13:07.391 --> 00:13:10.660
<v Speaker 1>his best friends in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and China knows it.</v>

232
00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:17.783
<v Speaker 3>Right?</v>

233
00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:19.920
<v Speaker 1>Does pursuit,</v>

234
00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:23.080
<v Speaker 3>okay.</v>

235
00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:27.160
<v Speaker 1>China and the Chinese influence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region is becoming a great obsession for</v>

236
00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:28.053
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rex tillerson himself use the monroe </v>

237
00:13:30.161 --> 00:13:30.994
<v Speaker 1>doctrine to see that the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>has the right to block the interference </v>

238
00:13:33.941 --> 00:13:37.760
<v Speaker 1>of another power in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the question is,</v>

239
00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:41.210
<v Speaker 1>who gave the United States government </v>
<v Speaker 1>that power in the first place?</v>

240
00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:42.853
<v Speaker 1>Latin America does not need new imperial</v>
<v Speaker 1>powers that seek only to benefit their </v>

241
00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:48.830
<v Speaker 1>own people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rex tillerson allow me to explain this.</v>

242
00:13:48.831 --> 00:13:49.664
<v Speaker 1>Latin American countries have all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights in the wells to seek other </v>

243
00:13:52.041 --> 00:13:53.420
<v Speaker 1>alliances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other markets,</v>

244
00:13:53.421 --> 00:13:56.160
<v Speaker 1>and other investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if those are Chinese,</v>

245
00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:03.950
<v Speaker 1>so the u s department of State should </v>
<v Speaker 1>ask itself is how is it possible that Xi</v>

246
00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:07.250
<v Speaker 1>Jingping has visited the region more </v>
<v Speaker 1>times in the last five years?</v>

247
00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:09.500
<v Speaker 1>Then the presidents of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

248
00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:11.330
<v Speaker 1>both Obama and trump</v>

249
00:14:13.710 --> 00:14:14.110
<v Speaker 3>hold it.</v>

250
00:14:14.110 --> 00:14:14.943
<v Speaker 1>China is willing to promote trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements and investments while trump </v>

251
00:14:17.741 --> 00:14:20.440
<v Speaker 1>is determines to punish Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>build walls,</v>

252
00:14:20.530 --> 00:14:21.363
<v Speaker 1>and restricts trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A great example of this is the shutting </v>

253
00:14:23.111 --> 00:14:25.870
<v Speaker 1>down of the TPP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest trade agreements in history,</v>

254
00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:27.730
<v Speaker 1>which includes among other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

255
00:14:27.731 --> 00:14:28.750
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Chile.</v>

256
00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:31.900
<v Speaker 1>See in the last Latin American and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean states community meeting,</v>

257
00:14:31.901 --> 00:14:32.734
<v Speaker 1>China announced it would invest $250 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion in the region in the next </v>

258
00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:38.703
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the United States wants to maintain </v>

259
00:14:39.641 --> 00:14:43.390
<v Speaker 1>its power and its influence and continue</v>
<v Speaker 1>to determine the political agenda,</v>

260
00:14:43.420 --> 00:14:44.253
<v Speaker 1>perhaps it should include looking after </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America's interests in its </v>

261
00:14:47.501 --> 00:14:49.720
<v Speaker 1>political strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

262

<v Speaker 1>how would you assess the USS influence </v>
