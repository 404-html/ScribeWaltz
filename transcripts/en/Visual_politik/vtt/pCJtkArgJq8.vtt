1
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.353
<v Speaker 1>It's no secret Israel and the Arab </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries have never had a good </v>

2
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.860
<v Speaker 1>relationship and they've always had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty terrible one.</v>

3
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Three wars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of diplomatic conflict,</v>

4
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:21.330
<v Speaker 1>send all kinds of accusations.</v>

5
00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:24.563
<v Speaker 1>The Arab Israeli conflict was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>hottest in the second half of the 20th </v>

6
00:00:27.661 --> 00:00:28.494
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when you have problems with your </v>

7
00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:31.080
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well you have a problem,</v>

8
00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:34.530
<v Speaker 1>but if your neighbors are the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil producers in the world,</v>

9
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.440
<v Speaker 1>well then you really have a much bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.303
<v Speaker 1>This is especially true when you </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider that Israel has always been </v>

11
00:00:40.801 --> 00:00:43.260
<v Speaker 1>considered something of an energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>wasteland.</v>

12
00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.200
<v Speaker 1>All attempts to find oil there weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been successful.</v>

13
00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
<v Speaker 1>Now it is true that up until 1979,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel has a nice Aulani in the region.</v>

14
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.860
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess which country this was?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

15
00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.740
<v Speaker 1>you might be surprised to learn that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was Iran.</v>

16
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.701
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

17
00:00:56.701 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 1>In the Times of the shower of Persia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran was a close ally of Israel.</v>

18
00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.553
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they both had a common enemy and that </v>

19
00:01:03.421 --> 00:01:05.880
<v Speaker 1>was the Arabic countries for the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

20
00:01:05.881 --> 00:01:06.714
<v Speaker 1>We see them arriving at Parliament House</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take over the range of Apis that </v>

21
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>these countries and such a close </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship that in 1978,</v>

22
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Israel offered the shower of punisher </v>
<v Speaker 1>help in building nuclear power plants.</v>

23
00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

24
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.620
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all changed in 1979 with Khomeini's</v>

25
00:01:22.621 --> 00:01:25.620
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From that moment on Israel and Iran went</v>

26
00:01:25.621 --> 00:01:27.330
<v Speaker 1>from being good friends too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:27.331 --> 00:01:28.500
<v Speaker 1>great enemies.</v>

28
00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.460
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that Israel has always had </v>
<v Speaker 1>two main weaknesses.</v>

29
00:01:35.461 --> 00:01:36.294
<v Speaker 1>The first is this bad relations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the region and the seconds </v>

30
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:42.390
<v Speaker 1>are the difficulties they've had </v>
<v Speaker 1>ensuring that oil supply,</v>

31
00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.253
<v Speaker 1>especially when facing conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the minister for energy in Israel </v>

32
00:01:46.051 --> 00:01:50.150
<v Speaker 1>admitted in 2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This real situation is complicated.</v>

33
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:51.713
<v Speaker 1>Don't have diplomatic relations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the countries from which we </v>

34
00:01:54.271 --> 00:01:56.820
<v Speaker 1>import oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yusef Paritski.</v>

35
00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.340
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems as if all of this,</v>

36
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:00.203
<v Speaker 1>it's about to change gift gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the definition Benjamin </v>

37
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Netanyahu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel's prime minister,</v>

38
00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.293
<v Speaker 1>gave to the latest discoveries made in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mediterranean Sea discoveries which </v>

39
00:02:15.361 --> 00:02:16.194
<v Speaker 1>might change forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These strategic reality of the conflict </v>

40
00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:18.944
<v Speaker 1>of region of the Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now you are probably wondering what </v>

41
00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:26.980
<v Speaker 1>might those discoveries beat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:26.981 --> 00:02:27.814
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to this map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each yellow piece represents the newly </v>

43
00:02:31.031 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>discovered natural gas</v>

44
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.193
<v Speaker 2>fields</v>

45
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.743
<v Speaker 1>and these are not small fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>either the last of them to be found and </v>

46
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:42.830
<v Speaker 1>known as Leviathan is one of the largest</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves founds in the last few decades.</v>

47
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.043
<v Speaker 1>Israel has done everything they could </v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1952 in order to find oil or gas </v>

48
00:02:50.681 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>in that territory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that they could achieve energy</v>

49
00:02:53.141 --> 00:02:55.390
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm until the year 2000.</v>

50
00:02:55.391 --> 00:02:57.700
<v Speaker 1>All of their attempts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were unsuccessful.</v>

51
00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.120
<v Speaker 1>If you were 10 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years ago,</v>

52
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.013
<v Speaker 1>and I said Israel would find a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of energy and be almost totally </v>

53
00:03:04.841 --> 00:03:08.200
<v Speaker 1>independent when it comes to energy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you would think that I am crazy.</v>

54
00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.470
<v Speaker 1>We were the country of milk and honey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when it came to oil,</v>

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.610
<v Speaker 1>we've left it to our neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not t beren boy Thomas Group.</v>

56
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.980
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything started to change in the year</v>

57
00:03:17.981 --> 00:03:20.920
<v Speaker 1>2000 thanks to technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When a tax company,</v>

58
00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:24.280
<v Speaker 1>Nobel energy founds the first reserve in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the open sea,</v>

59
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 1>known as Mari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>be this first one,</v>

60
00:03:26.591 --> 00:03:27.424
<v Speaker 1>it was small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was a turning point because they </v>

61
00:03:28.931 --> 00:03:29.764
<v Speaker 1>knew that under the sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the sea bed that were surprises </v>

62
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:33.514
<v Speaker 1>waiting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so noble energy kept exploring the </v>

63
00:03:35.171 --> 00:03:37.870
<v Speaker 1>bottom of the sea and in 2009 they hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Jack.</v>

64
00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.540
<v Speaker 1>They found it for you tomorrow reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you science was significance.</v>

65
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.300
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reserve provides Israel with half of</v>

66
00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:54.050
<v Speaker 1>that electricity requirements last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>later in 2010.</v>

67
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Well they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just hit the Jackpot.</v>

68
00:03:55.761 --> 00:03:58.830
<v Speaker 1>In the casino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won the lottery after spending only</v>

69
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.733
<v Speaker 1>$100,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars in the exploration of </v>

70
00:04:00.861 --> 00:04:03.440
<v Speaker 1>the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>noble energy hits Leviathan,</v>

71
00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.403
<v Speaker 1>an enormous field.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you're probably starting to </v>

72
00:04:06.771 --> 00:04:09.420
<v Speaker 1>understand what's going on here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little best app.</v>

73
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.333
<v Speaker 1>It is estimated that this reserve is </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger than all of the ones found in </v>

74
00:04:13.341 --> 00:04:17.120
<v Speaker 1>countries like Bolivia or Mexico as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>

75
00:04:17.121 --> 00:04:21.020
<v Speaker 1>This is not the end of the story because</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of this area is still unexplored.</v>

76
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.913
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the geological studies have indicated </v>

77
00:04:23.211 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>that there is much more natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>5,000 meters below the surface.</v>

78
00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is also oil.</v>

79
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:30.473
<v Speaker 1>Moreover,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government estimates that the </v>

80
00:04:31.101 --> 00:04:31.934
<v Speaker 1>Mediterranean could be holding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>colossal wealth in natural gas and oil </v>

81
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.120
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This falls within Israeli waters.</v>

82
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:39.653
<v Speaker 1>In total,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government estimates that there </v>

83
00:04:40.401 --> 00:04:41.234
<v Speaker 1>might be more than 3 trillion cubic </v>
<v Speaker 1>meters of gas and 6 billion barrels of </v>

84
00:04:45.141 --> 00:04:47.090
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

85
00:04:47.091 --> 00:04:47.924
<v Speaker 1>that's all well and good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what exactly is 3 trillion cubic </v>

86
00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.960
<v Speaker 1>meters?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not exactly easy to picture,</v>

87
00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>so you can appreciate the songs of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If these estimations.</v>

88
00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.440
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>

89
00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:58.283
<v Speaker 1>a small country of only around $8 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants could become one of </v>

90
00:05:01.071 --> 00:05:01.904
<v Speaker 1>the top 15 countries when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas reserves and in the top 20 </v>

91
00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:07.040
<v Speaker 1>countries when it comes to it</v>

92
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.893
<v Speaker 2>oil.</v>

93
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.633
<v Speaker 1>This is not just for Israel exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've already started at the end of </v>

94
00:05:21.081 --> 00:05:21.914
<v Speaker 1>2016 Israeli companies reached an </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement with the government of Jordan </v>

95
00:05:24.831 --> 00:05:27.500
<v Speaker 1>to become its main supplier for the next</v>
<v Speaker 1>15 years.</v>

96
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.393
<v Speaker 1>It's a contract will have more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000,000,000 between 50 and 60 </v>

97
00:05:32.151 --> 00:05:32.984
<v Speaker 1>percent of that money is going straight </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the coffers of the Israeli </v>

98
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:36.343
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the right division of politic </v>

99
00:05:37.291 --> 00:05:38.540
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or in the next few decades,</v>

100
00:05:38.541 --> 00:05:39.374
<v Speaker 1>the government of Israel is going to get</v>
<v Speaker 1>an income in the tens of billions of </v>

101
00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.020
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tentative estimations,</v>

102
00:05:44.021 --> 00:05:44.854
<v Speaker 1>and I confirmed we would be talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about hundreds of billions of dollars </v>

103
00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:49.243
<v Speaker 1>and there's more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Israel lacks continental </v>

104
00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:53.540
<v Speaker 1>oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there could be in massive quantities</v>

105
00:05:53.541 --> 00:05:54.374
<v Speaker 1>of shale oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The type of oil that can be extracted </v>

106
00:05:56.391 --> 00:05:57.224
<v Speaker 1>through fracking well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've already found the first </v>

107
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>reserves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that not only is Israel going</v>

108
00:06:04.611 --> 00:06:05.444
<v Speaker 1>to achieve energy independence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it could even become a new energy </v>

109
00:06:08.481 --> 00:06:09.140
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

110
00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Now you might know why ness and Yahoo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has referred to these fields as God's</v>

111
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.660
<v Speaker 1>gift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few years ago,</v>

112
00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:15.523
<v Speaker 1>golden year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ex prime minister told this famous </v>

113
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:18.404
<v Speaker 1>joke.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you something that we </v>

114
00:06:19.821 --> 00:06:20.654
<v Speaker 1>Israelis have against Moses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took us 40 years through the desert </v>

115
00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:26.510
<v Speaker 1>in order to bring us to the one spot in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East that has no oil.</v>

116
00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Golda Meir,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

117
00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.910
<v Speaker 1>it sure looks like this is no longer the</v>
<v Speaker 1>case and to this discovery,</v>

118
00:06:31.911 --> 00:06:32.744
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Israel is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovative countries in the world and </v>

119
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:36.134
<v Speaker 1>it's entirely possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could soon become one of the world's </v>

120
00:06:38.541 --> 00:06:39.950
<v Speaker 1>wealthiest countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

121
00:06:39.951 --> 00:06:42.980
<v Speaker 1>it's also probably important that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned another player here.</v>

122
00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:46.130
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess who were the first to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an interest in these reserves?</v>

123
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.660
<v Speaker 1>It was the Russians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

124
00:06:47.720 --> 00:06:48.553
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really Gazprom actually tried to buy </v>

125
00:06:50.661 --> 00:06:51.494
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all indicates that Israel could </v>

126
00:06:52.761 --> 00:06:55.970
<v Speaker 1>take part of the Russian gas market </v>
<v Speaker 1>share in Europe,</v>

127
00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.893
<v Speaker 1>and as you already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>energy means money and influence new </v>

128
00:07:02.451 --> 00:07:03.284
<v Speaker 1>allies.</v>

129
00:07:04.070 --> 00:07:07.400
<v Speaker 1>The international situation of Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's always been controversial,</v>

130
00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>was political conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The UN resolutions,</v>

131
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.173
<v Speaker 1>the Israeli Minister of foreign affairs </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to work harder than Santa Claus on </v>

132
00:07:13.671 --> 00:07:16.970
<v Speaker 1>Christmas Eve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider the last events from the UN.</v>

133
00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:22.100
<v Speaker 1>UN Security Council passes resolution </v>
<v Speaker 1>demanding end to Israeli settlements.</v>

134
00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:23.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>

135
00:07:23.751 --> 00:07:26.720
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that Israeli foreign policy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is stronger than ever.</v>

136
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:27.583
<v Speaker 1>Israeli authorities are determined to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put an end to their dependence on the </v>

137
00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:34.520
<v Speaker 1>United States and these recent gas and </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil discoveries have certainly helps.</v>

138
00:07:34.550 --> 00:07:35.383
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations with their neighboring </v>

139
00:07:36.231 --> 00:07:37.064
<v Speaker 1>countries have improved quickly and by a</v>
<v Speaker 1>great amount in 2010 relations with </v>

140
00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:42.374
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you broke down almost completely when </v>

141
00:07:43.551 --> 00:07:45.770
<v Speaker 1>Israel approached the freedom flow </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiller,</v>

142
00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:46.633
<v Speaker 1>but now these relations at being healed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This probably has a lot to do with the </v>

143
00:07:49.581 --> 00:07:50.414
<v Speaker 1>fact that Erdogan is country uses up </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive quantities of natural gas and </v>

144
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:54.704
<v Speaker 1>they're important agreements with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia will be over in just five years </v>

145
00:07:57.350 --> 00:07:58.183
<v Speaker 1>and we already know how unstable </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations are lately between these two </v>

146
00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.880
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

147
00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.400
<v Speaker 1>Things are also working out great with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their other neighbors.</v>

148
00:08:04.401 --> 00:08:07.310
<v Speaker 1>Egypt and Jordan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel hasn't just become Jordan's major</v>

149
00:08:07.311 --> 00:08:09.950
<v Speaker 1>gas supplier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the relations with Egypt are working</v>

150
00:08:09.951 --> 00:08:13.750
<v Speaker 1>so well that shall keep the minister of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Foreign Affairs Watch footballs,</v>

151
00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>European Championship final in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>residence of the Israeli prime minister.</v>

152
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Further the unimaginable it could even </v>
<v Speaker 1>be happening.</v>

153
00:08:20.090 --> 00:08:23.930
<v Speaker 1>Some are talking about reconciliation </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Israel and Saudi Arabia.</v>

154
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:25.723
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia are reportedly negotiating </v>

155
00:08:27.890 --> 00:08:28.723
<v Speaker 1>economic ties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel is also bonding with Tsipras </v>

156
00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.293
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has surprisingly the come a close </v>

157
00:08:33.381 --> 00:08:34.160
<v Speaker 1>ally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

158
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:36.530
<v Speaker 1>the Israeli air force is now training in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>

159
00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.060
<v Speaker 1>but the really major change has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the east ends in this process.</v>

160
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:44.390
<v Speaker 1>India was key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>India has made Israel its second largest</v>

161
00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:46.850
<v Speaker 1>arms supplier behind Russia in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>decade.</v>

162
00:08:46.851 --> 00:08:50.990
<v Speaker 1>India has bought from Israel more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>$10,000,000,000 of military equipment.</v>

163
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Their relations are so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

164
00:08:52.681 --> 00:08:54.990
<v Speaker 1>so this in 2015 for the first time in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

165
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>the president of India went to Israel on</v>
<v Speaker 1>an official visit.</v>

166
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:01.483
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jump Modi to become first Indian prime </v>

167
00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>minister to visit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>

168
00:09:06.361 --> 00:09:08.400
<v Speaker 1>Let's just add one more thing on their </v>
<v Speaker 1>subjects.</v>

169
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:09.293
<v Speaker 1>Up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece and India had been very critical </v>

170
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>of Israel as a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation with Palestine,</v>

171
00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:15.624
<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine what a step this was </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign </v>

172
00:09:18.630 --> 00:09:19.463
<v Speaker 1>Affairs and India is not the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel is also building a close </v>

173
00:09:22.321 --> 00:09:26.130
<v Speaker 1>relationship with China and they own </v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating a free trade agreements.</v>

174
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:29.490
<v Speaker 1>It's the only Chinese businessman then </v>
<v Speaker 1>making strong investments in the country</v>

175
00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:30.383
<v Speaker 1>and think even building a port in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city of Ashdod as part of their Silk </v>

176
00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:35.733
<v Speaker 1>Road Jack,</v>

177
00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.630
<v Speaker 1>so their relationships developing with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

178
00:09:42.631 --> 00:09:45.900
<v Speaker 1>South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really seems that anywhere in Asia,</v>

179
00:09:45.930 --> 00:09:50.460
<v Speaker 1>Israel is a total success only we </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't forgotten about Donald Trump who</v>

180
00:09:50.461 --> 00:09:52.110
<v Speaker 1>for now mez committed to this.</v>

181
00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.033
<v Speaker 3>It's our true friend over there and </v>
<v Speaker 3>we're going to protect Israel 100 </v>

182
00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:57.680
<v Speaker 3>percent</v>

183
00:09:57.680 --> 00:09:58.513
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's still a long way to go for </v>

184
00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:01.910
<v Speaker 1>Israel to become an energy power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they do,</v>

185
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:04.700
<v Speaker 1>it will have a positive effect for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>area's stability,</v>

186
00:10:04.730 --> 00:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>which think would be a very good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

187
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.680
<v Speaker 1>Israel is well on its way to becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great country,</v>

188
00:10:09.681 --> 00:10:10.514
<v Speaker 1>but there are still some things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>need to be dealt with like the conflict </v>

189
00:10:12.981 --> 00:10:13.814
<v Speaker 1>in Palestine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily better relations with Arabic </v>

190
00:10:15.681 --> 00:10:17.840
<v Speaker 1>countries could help in this matter a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot.</v>

191
00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.630
<v Speaker 1>So now what do you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this new energy wealth</v>

192
00:10:20.631 --> 00:10:23.540
<v Speaker 1>will contribute to the solution of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict?</v>
