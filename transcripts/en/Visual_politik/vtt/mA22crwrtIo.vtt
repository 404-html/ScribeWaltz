00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.550
<v Speaker 1>On this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we talk about politics.</v>

2
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.483
<v Speaker 1>Are you prepared to accept the truth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because that's what I'm going to tell </v>

3
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.820
<v Speaker 1>these people are out to make your lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>a living hell.</v>

4
00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.330
<v Speaker 1>You are fake news,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay?</v>

5
00:00:10.331 --> 00:00:12.090
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not this kind of politics.</v>

6
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:12.924
<v Speaker 1>In this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we want to know the why of politics and </v>

7
00:00:14.941 --> 00:00:18.090
<v Speaker 1>the why of economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the whole world needs your oil,</v>

8
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.240
<v Speaker 1>you have all of the deal making power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to understand why some countries</v>

9
00:00:24.781 --> 00:00:25.614
<v Speaker 1>are poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did the government destroy the </v>

10
00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:28.074
<v Speaker 1>economy in such a short amount of time </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how good politics can make good </v>

11
00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:32.993
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland has one of the world's best </v>

12
00:00:34.801 --> 00:00:35.634
<v Speaker 1>political systems and we believe that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the reason that they are </v>

13
00:00:38.551 --> 00:00:42.000
<v Speaker 1>successful and to understand how the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world is changing.</v>

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.223
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Estonia has invented a brands new </v>

15
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:48.390
<v Speaker 1>concepts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the concept of liquid citizenship.</v>

16
00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.240
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has nothing to do with the politics</v>

17
00:00:51.241 --> 00:00:53.880
<v Speaker 1>that you see in the traditional media.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's real.</v>

18
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.160
<v Speaker 1>It's informative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's visual or politic,</v>

19
00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.570
<v Speaker 1>and welcome to our channel.</v>
