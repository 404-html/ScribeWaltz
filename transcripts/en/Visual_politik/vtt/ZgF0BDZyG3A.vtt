1
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.323
<v Speaker 1>Tom's approach towards Russia has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most controversial parts of </v>

2
00:00:11.551 --> 00:00:12.384
<v Speaker 1>his short time in office so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems that the US president wants to </v>

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:16.950
<v Speaker 1>develop a new friendship with this old </v>
<v Speaker 1>rival.</v>

4
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.813
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that this isn't breathing </v>
<v Speaker 1>so easy and that's because Beijing is </v>

5
00:00:21.211 --> 00:00:22.044
<v Speaker 1>standing between them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia who's in Moscow without any </v>

6
00:00:24.601 --> 00:00:25.434
<v Speaker 1>doubt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most controversial issues is </v>

7
00:00:26.821 --> 00:00:30.600
<v Speaker 1>the fascination trump seems to have with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and its charismatic leader,</v>

8
00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.690
<v Speaker 1>Vladimir Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insinuations messages of support and the</v>

9
00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:34.524
<v Speaker 1>election of senior officials who were </v>
<v Speaker 1>close to the Kremlin years met with </v>

10
00:00:36.961 --> 00:00:41.170
<v Speaker 1>Russian President Vladimir Putin and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kremlin gave him the order of friendship</v>

11
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.820
<v Speaker 1>and $2,000.</v>

12
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.653
<v Speaker 2>13,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new administration to where it is </v>

13
00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.690
<v Speaker 2>just being shaped right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is absolutely a gift for him.</v>

14
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.730
<v Speaker 2>He couldn't have dreamed about anything </v>
<v Speaker 2>like that just a few months ago.</v>

15
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.683
<v Speaker 1>The question really is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is trump trying to seduce the Russian </v>

16
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.230
<v Speaker 1>leadership or as some are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there something suspicious about this</v>

17
00:00:58.231 --> 00:00:59.064
<v Speaker 1>developing relationship?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be fair to say that trump's </v>

18
00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:04.390
<v Speaker 1>approach to Russia could have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>explanation according to some analysts,</v>

19
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.253
<v Speaker 1>advisors in the White House may have </v>
<v Speaker 1>told trump to try to be remembered and </v>

20
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.843
<v Speaker 1>make history by being the leader who has</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same success with Russia as Nixon </v>

21
00:01:12.691 --> 00:01:14.400
<v Speaker 1>and Kissinger had with Chinese</v>

22
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Nixon's had used his mouth China on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>20th,</v>

23
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.300
<v Speaker 1>first of February,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1972.</v>

24
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:26.140
<v Speaker 1>One of the most important events in </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades took place that day.</v>

25
00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.033
<v Speaker 1>Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the first ever visits you've </v>

26
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.990
<v Speaker 1>communist China by a US</v>

27
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.873
<v Speaker 2>president</v>

28
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.320
<v Speaker 1>for Nixon on unknowns there for </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain.</v>

29
00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.280
<v Speaker 1>The entire trip was broadcast around the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and it was major,</v>

30
00:01:45.281 --> 00:01:48.070
<v Speaker 1>major news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Millions of people held their breaths as</v>

31
00:01:48.071 --> 00:01:48.904
<v Speaker 1>they saw Nixon descending the stairs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Air Force One and setting force in the </v>

32
00:01:52.301 --> 00:01:53.650
<v Speaker 1>Chinese capital city</v>

33
00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.143
<v Speaker 2>generations in the years ahead.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll look back and thank for this </v>

34
00:02:00.791 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 2>meeting that we have in this past week.</v>

35
00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.033
<v Speaker 1>We continue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's actually go back at this and see </v>

36
00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:07.734
<v Speaker 1>what this visit really met.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What were the goals of this visits and </v>

37
00:02:10.291 --> 00:02:12.730
<v Speaker 1>what made it possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're going to travel back in time,</v>

38
00:02:12.731 --> 00:02:15.150
<v Speaker 1>but so you October the first 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>49,</v>

39
00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.160
<v Speaker 1>this was the date that China was </v>
<v Speaker 1>declared,</v>

40
00:02:17.161 --> 00:02:17.994
<v Speaker 1>I think People's Republic of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Communists led by now had one the </v>

41
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 1>Chinese civil war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they took power of this new country.</v>

42
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.230
<v Speaker 1>This new regime was completely hostile </v>
<v Speaker 1>to Washington DC.</v>

43
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.123
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only a year later trips of the Chinese </v>

44
00:02:30.841 --> 00:02:31.674
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you participated in the Korean War to </v>

45
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:33.744
<v Speaker 1>support Pyongyang's regime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>therefore confronting the US faced as a </v>

46
00:02:40.721 --> 00:02:42.880
<v Speaker 1>result of this better runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violent fight,</v>

47
00:02:42.881 --> 00:02:45.160
<v Speaker 1>and did thousands of casualties on each </v>
<v Speaker 1>side.</v>

48
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.550
<v Speaker 1>There were no intentions of establishing</v>
<v Speaker 1>any diplomatic relations.</v>

49
00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.540
<v Speaker 1>It would be fair to say that from that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time on China in the US were enemies.</v>

50
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:55.670
<v Speaker 2>You have to move in this neighborhood.</v>

51
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:01.563
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations between Beijing and Moscow </v>

52
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.900
<v Speaker 1>with very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>

53
00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.100
<v Speaker 1>It is true that Mao had never goes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Soviet leaders who had,</v>

54
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.953
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you supported other people to be the </v>

55
00:03:10.001 --> 00:03:12.130
<v Speaker 1>leader of the Chinese Communist Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

56
00:03:12.131 --> 00:03:12.964
<v Speaker 1>despite all of these differences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Russian Chinese alliance was almost </v>

57
00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.470
<v Speaker 1>inevitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

58
00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:21.550
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union needed to control or at</v>
<v Speaker 1>least influence the other grades,</v>

59
00:03:21.551 --> 00:03:23.080
<v Speaker 1>communist power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

60
00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Mao's China desperately needed the USSR </v>
<v Speaker 1>for economic,</v>

61
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.690
<v Speaker 1>technological as well as military </v>
<v Speaker 1>support.</v>

62
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.280
<v Speaker 1>The support was so generous in fact that</v>
<v Speaker 1>between the in 1954 in 1959,</v>

63
00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:37.810
<v Speaker 1>the Ussr spent seven percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's resources assisting China.</v>

64
00:03:37.811 --> 00:03:42.811
<v Speaker 1>It's even say that this was the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological transfer in fight.</v>

65
00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:46.483
<v Speaker 1>All of this differences started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>emerge in almost every part of their </v>

66
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:50.174
<v Speaker 1>relationship and the alliance got weaker</v>
<v Speaker 1>and weaker until well that completely </v>

67
00:03:53.331 --> 00:03:55.840
<v Speaker 1>broke apart relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're getting very census.</v>

68
00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.050
<v Speaker 1>There was the assault of the US embassy </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Beijing in 1967,</v>

69
00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.080
<v Speaker 1>and then the first armed encounter took </v>
<v Speaker 1>place in 1970 disease.</v>

70
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.820
<v Speaker 1>When numerous during this fight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a few days later,</v>

71
00:04:14.821 --> 00:04:17.790
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet bombarded Chinese troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>deployed in the area.</v>

72
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.703
<v Speaker 1>The conflict didn't go any further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for days there was a feeling in the </v>

73
00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:23.880
<v Speaker 1>air that this could be the start of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant war.</v>

74
00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:24.743
<v Speaker 1>Moscow even considered sending troops </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the Warsaw Pact countries which </v>

75
00:04:27.361 --> 00:04:28.194
<v Speaker 1>remain your objective</v>

76
00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.293
<v Speaker 2>two,</v>

77
00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.260
<v Speaker 1>so you said that's in order to prevent a</v>
<v Speaker 1>potential nuclear attack by Russia.</v>

78
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.123
<v Speaker 1>Nixon contacted Moscow to make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfectly clear that the US would never </v>

79
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:39.204
<v Speaker 1>accept something like that happening </v>
<v Speaker 1>under any circumstances in the </v>

80
00:04:50.091 --> 00:04:50.924
<v Speaker 1>interrelations between these two.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communist nations broke down completely </v>

81
00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.020
<v Speaker 1>at the time that both Nixon and his </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous national security advisor,</v>

82
00:04:57.021 --> 00:04:57.854
<v Speaker 1>Henry Kissinger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just only need to take a famous saying </v>

83
00:05:00.201 --> 00:05:05.201
<v Speaker 1>and make it their own one over my enemy </v>
<v Speaker 1>is my friend,</v>

84
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:07.103
<v Speaker 1>and once that said that they started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>put it into action and two years later </v>

85
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Nixon was in Beijing relations between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the USA and China and moved on slowly.</v>

86
00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:16.193
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't until 1979 with Jimmy Carter </v>

87
00:05:18.421 --> 00:05:21.750
<v Speaker 1>in office that full relations with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>nation were established,</v>

88
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:22.673
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that Nixon's trip to </v>
<v Speaker 1>China made room for a period of </v>

89
00:05:25.711 --> 00:05:28.350
<v Speaker 1>successful relationships between the two</v>
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>

90
00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:29.243
<v Speaker 1>In 1972 bilateral trade between the two </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations didn't even reach a billion </v>

91
00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.900
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today the number is close to 600.</v>

92
00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:39.273
<v Speaker 2>Really</v>

93
00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:41.883
<v Speaker 1>things have been relatively friendly and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US also made a solid ally against </v>

94
00:05:45.041 --> 00:05:50.041
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union during the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to some analysts.</v>

95
00:05:52.861 --> 00:05:55.560
<v Speaker 1>That's what trump is trying to achieve </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Russia.</v>

96
00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:59.060
<v Speaker 1>The reenactment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nixon and strategy for Beijing,</v>

97
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.433
<v Speaker 1>Moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would explain the pro Russian </v>

98
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.744
<v Speaker 1>attitude of the current president's </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are very much different now than </v>

99
00:06:06.051 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>they were in 1969</v>

100
00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.320
<v Speaker 3>enrollments between China,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Russia,</v>

101
00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:16.933
<v Speaker 1>relations between China and Russia have </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to improve since the end of the </v>

102
00:06:19.521 --> 00:06:23.330
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties with some treaties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements being signed here and that,</v>

103
00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.320
<v Speaker 1>but it all changed when Xi Jinping came </v>
<v Speaker 1>to power in 2012.</v>

104
00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:30.320
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations have advanced quickly consider</v>

105
00:06:30.321 --> 00:06:31.154
<v Speaker 1>what was said in 2016 by one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>major players in the Chinese </v>

106
00:06:34.221 --> 00:06:35.054
<v Speaker 1>government's the profundity ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The level of coordination between both </v>

107
00:06:38.601 --> 00:06:42.320
<v Speaker 1>countries has reached a level we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>never seen before and it's.</v>

108
00:06:42.321 --> 00:06:43.154
<v Speaker 1>Beijing seems to be certain about one </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing and alliance between China and </v>

109
00:06:46.011 --> 00:06:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Russia would be very powerful from any </v>
<v Speaker 1>perspective today.</v>

110
00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.850
<v Speaker 1>Both countries are cooperating like </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've never cooperated.</v>

111
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.333
<v Speaker 1>Thousand and 16.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia became the first Chinese oil </v>

112
00:07:01.081 --> 00:07:01.914
<v Speaker 1>supplier with oil that arrives by lands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something incredibly important </v>

113
00:07:04.981 --> 00:07:05.814
<v Speaker 1>for China because in the case of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict and the US would be unable to </v>

114
00:07:08.371 --> 00:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>block the island writing something it </v>
<v Speaker 1>could do if that's all it is,</v>

115
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:16.401
<v Speaker 1>arriving by sea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both countries have started to conduct a</v>

116
00:07:24.831 --> 00:07:25.664
<v Speaker 1>joint military exercises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've also created economic and </v>

117
00:07:28.191 --> 00:07:29.024
<v Speaker 1>technological bonds end up agreeing to </v>
<v Speaker 1>carry out projects to build </v>

118
00:07:31.341 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure which will connect both </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

119
00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>So how about some examples of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

120
00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:38.510
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>exercises.</v>

121
00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:39.513
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

122
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.560
<v Speaker 3>Russia and China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Have you gone eight days of naval drills</v>

123
00:07:44.561 --> 00:07:45.700
<v Speaker 3>in the South China Sea</v>

124
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.060
<v Speaker 1>seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those economic</v>

125
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.053
<v Speaker 2>bombs</v>

126
00:07:53.430 --> 00:07:57.660
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure for this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what better example than this?</v>

127
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.703
<v Speaker 1>After 20 years of talks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>construction has finally started on a </v>

128
00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:03.080
<v Speaker 1>bridge between China and</v>

129
00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.103
<v Speaker 2>Russia</v>

130
00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:09.553
<v Speaker 1>is more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two countries have signed </v>

131
00:08:11.031 --> 00:08:11.864
<v Speaker 1>important military agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of has committed to spending </v>

132
00:08:14.301 --> 00:08:15.134
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars to buy it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the most modern equipment that </v>

133
00:08:17.421 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 1>the Russian army has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the s 400 surface to air missile</v>

134
00:08:21.370 --> 00:08:22.203
<v Speaker 1>ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most impressive weapon in the </v>

135
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:26.360
<v Speaker 1>rationale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sequoia at 35 fighter aircraft,</v>

136
00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:28.400
<v Speaker 1>just to have a look at this incredible</v>

137
00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>

138
00:08:37.410 --> 00:08:40.860
<v Speaker 1>There are also many economic political </v>
<v Speaker 1>men's monetary agreements.</v>

139
00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 1>All of this has led to quite a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>concern in the United States.</v>

140
00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:52.060
<v Speaker 3>Tiny Russian author just</v>

141
00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:52.893
<v Speaker 1>sit there for just a second before you </v>
<v Speaker 1>start to get scared because everything </v>

142
00:08:55.921 --> 00:08:59.550
<v Speaker 1>isn't quite as ideal as it sounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both powers may have come together,</v>

143
00:08:59.551 --> 00:09:02.560
<v Speaker 1>but there are still many elements that </v>
<v Speaker 1>separate them.</v>

144
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.590
<v Speaker 1>More mites potentially weaken this </v>
<v Speaker 1>unity.</v>

145
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:05.453
<v Speaker 1>For One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China wants to be important and </v>

146
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:10.680
<v Speaker 1>influential in international politics </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's employees becoming the leader</v>

147
00:09:10.681 --> 00:09:11.514
<v Speaker 1>of Central Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that Russia certainly </v>

148
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:14.940
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In their view,</v>

149
00:09:14.941 --> 00:09:19.260
<v Speaker 1>the ex Soviet states in the region have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to remain under the influence of Moscow.</v>

150
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.143
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are issues concerning their </v>

151
00:09:21.131 --> 00:09:21.964
<v Speaker 1>economic relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trade is unbalanced in favor of </v>

152
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:25.224
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia has become a supplier of natural </v>

153
00:09:26.491 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>resources to train.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the last few years,</v>

154
00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:32.400
<v Speaker 1>China has been supplying Russia with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese manufactured goods,</v>

155
00:09:32.430 --> 00:09:33.263
<v Speaker 1>which are more valuable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see China's position towards </v>

156
00:09:35.041 --> 00:09:35.874
<v Speaker 1>international trade is very pragmatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese people want to make money so </v>

157
00:09:39.061 --> 00:09:42.120
<v Speaker 1>they know it's good for them to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>their markets to the world.</v>

158
00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:44.660
<v Speaker 1>This is simply an idea that Russia </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't,</v>

159
00:09:47.570 --> 00:09:50.660
<v Speaker 1>and then there was the issue with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Russia's partners like India.</v>

160
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:51.523
<v Speaker 1>Russia is the largest weapons supplier </v>
<v Speaker 1>in India and and obviously Beijing </v>

161
00:09:55.011 --> 00:09:56.030
<v Speaker 1>doesn't like that at all,</v>

162
00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.913
<v Speaker 1>so even though these two countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to get closer and all supporting </v>

163
00:10:02.011 --> 00:10:02.844
<v Speaker 1>each other against the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't expect a very solid </v>

164
00:10:05.461 --> 00:10:09.030
<v Speaker 1>relationship between them after world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is eventually going to make a play</v>

165
00:10:09.031 --> 00:10:09.864
<v Speaker 1>to become the leader in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship and to Russia isn't just </v>

166
00:10:12.061 --> 00:10:17.061
<v Speaker 1>going to lie down and accept that one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you'd be honest.</v>

167
00:10:20.311 --> 00:10:24.120
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't seem very likely that </v>
<v Speaker 1>reenacting Nixon's strategy is possible.</v>

168
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.440
<v Speaker 1>This is largely because China is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>to strongly oppose this relationship,</v>

169
00:10:28.470 --> 00:10:29.303
<v Speaker 1>but despite this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if trump wants to earn the trust of </v>

170
00:10:30.691 --> 00:10:31.524
<v Speaker 1>Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will have to make some concessions </v>

171
00:10:32.941 --> 00:10:34.980
<v Speaker 1>which would be difficult to accept in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>

172
00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:38.020
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

173
00:10:38.250 --> 00:10:41.370
<v Speaker 1>Elimination of sanctions given you an on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ukraine and Syria,</v>

174
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.740
<v Speaker 1>the end of the anti missile shield among</v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

175
00:10:43.741 --> 00:10:48.110
<v Speaker 1>Susan is very demanding and even if a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good relationship is established between</v>

176
00:10:48.111 --> 00:10:48.944
<v Speaker 1>Russia and the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is not clear whether this alliance </v>

177
00:10:51.861 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 1>would be very effective as actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopping China.</v>

178
00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:55.333
<v Speaker 1>This is one reason why Obama prefer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy of surrounding China by </v>

179
00:10:58.311 --> 00:11:00.440
<v Speaker 1>reaching agreements with the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>

180
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:01.460
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>

181
00:11:01.461 --> 00:11:02.930
<v Speaker 1>Malaysia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this strategy,</v>

182
00:11:02.931 --> 00:11:03.764
<v Speaker 1>the TPP was key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was of course because it was one of </v>

183
00:11:06.261 --> 00:11:07.094
<v Speaker 1>the first things that trump flocks when </v>
<v Speaker 1>he arrived in the White House or any </v>

184
00:11:09.610 --> 00:11:12.830
<v Speaker 1>time is going to be able to tell where </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trump strategy is going to work out,</v>

185
00:11:12.880 --> 00:11:15.230
<v Speaker 1>but right now it's not looking very </v>
<v Speaker 1>promising.</v>

186
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.060
<v Speaker 1>So that's our opinion here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Visual politic,</v>

187
00:11:17.090 --> 00:11:18.800
<v Speaker 1>and we would love to know what you </v>
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

188
00:11:18.801 --> 00:11:22.070
<v Speaker 1>Do you think a Chinese Russian alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's going to be consolidated against</v>

189
00:11:22.071 --> 00:11:22.904
<v Speaker 1>the USA.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think trump will succeed in </v>

190
00:11:24.051 --> 00:11:28.280
<v Speaker 1>a nixon like relationship with Moscow?</v>
