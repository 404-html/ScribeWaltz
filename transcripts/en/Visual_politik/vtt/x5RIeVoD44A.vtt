1
00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>Nice to economics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what Axel rose is to the music industry,</v>

2
00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.600
<v Speaker 1>rocks in the late eighties and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the nineties.</v>

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:15.613
<v Speaker 1>Then they started losing grounds and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays anytime they try to make a </v>

4
00:00:18.681 --> 00:00:21.470
<v Speaker 1>comeback,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results are pretty disappointing.</v>

5
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.930
<v Speaker 1>I know you're thinking of first glance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan doesn't seem to be that bad,</v>

6
00:00:32.931 --> 00:00:34.760
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have the video games,</v>

7
00:00:34.761 --> 00:00:39.761
<v Speaker 1>the enemy movies and world class tech </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bam offs and cameras or Tokyo that looks</v>

8
00:00:40.161 --> 00:00:43.640
<v Speaker 1>like a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the world's biggest metropolis with</v>

9
00:00:43.641 --> 00:00:46.280
<v Speaker 1>over $30 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they have the fastest trains,</v>

10
00:00:46.281 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>the most modern tvs and even human like </v>
<v Speaker 1>robots.</v>

11
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.073
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country has gone through two </v>

12
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.350
<v Speaker 1>decades without any economic growth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I saw the worst of us.</v>

13
00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.213
<v Speaker 1>Japan is the most indebted country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world because they are more than </v>

14
00:01:01.221 --> 00:01:02.054
<v Speaker 1>twice their entire GDP and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population is increasing faster than </v>

15
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.043
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which poses a big problem when it comes </v>

16
00:01:07.761 --> 00:01:08.594
<v Speaker 1>to paying for retirement pensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one of the reasons why Japanese </v>

17
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.074
<v Speaker 1>workers have crazy hours and almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>vacation time and those good old </v>

18
00:01:15.321 --> 00:01:16.154
<v Speaker 1>technological juggernauts like a touch </v>
<v Speaker 1>or panasonic or falling behind the more </v>

19
00:01:19.461 --> 00:01:24.461
<v Speaker 1>modern companies from China and America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second because things,</v>

20
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.220
<v Speaker 1>they might be on the verge of change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

21
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking here about the Tokyo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics.</v>

22
00:01:33.651 --> 00:01:35.140
<v Speaker 1>Do you take place in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20?</v>

23
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.123
<v Speaker 1>It's an opportunity to showcase their </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire country and get the world's </v>

24
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

25
00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.560
<v Speaker 1>Did you ever since Japan won the Olympic</v>
<v Speaker 1>bid in 2013,</v>

26
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.290
<v Speaker 1>tourism has absolutely skyrocketed</v>

27
00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.160
<v Speaker 2>and the same goes with private </v>
<v Speaker 2>investment.</v>

28
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.053
<v Speaker 2>By the year 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 Tokyo will have 45 brand new </v>

29
00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:08.001
<v Speaker 2>skyscraper.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

30
00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.083
<v Speaker 2>Like Panasonic will set state of the art</v>
<v Speaker 2>solar cells in increasing location so </v>

31
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:17.680
<v Speaker 2>people can charge their electric cars </v>
<v Speaker 2>anywhere and if this wasn't enough,</v>

32
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.060
<v Speaker 2>Sony will launch their brand new eight k</v>
<v Speaker 2>TV screens.</v>

33
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:23.260
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had that right?</v>

34
00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are going to have eight cases.</v>

35
00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.900
<v Speaker 1>You can see every microfiber of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>athletes shirts,</v>

36
00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.580
<v Speaker 1>but hold on for just a second ed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because not everything is so beautiful.</v>

37
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.980
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when Tokyo won the Olympic bid,</v>

38
00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.460
<v Speaker 1>they had budgeted six point 5 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>American dollars,</v>

39
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.353
<v Speaker 1>but since they started building,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the costs have doubled and they haven't </v>

40
00:02:43.991 --> 00:02:44.830
<v Speaker 1>even finished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

41
00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.753
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo City Hall has predicted that the </v>

42
00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:51.190
<v Speaker 1>total cost might be up to around 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion USD,</v>

43
00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.910
<v Speaker 1>so the question is on the Olympic Games,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually an opportunity for Japan,</v>

44
00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:55.773
<v Speaker 1>or quite the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are the Olympic Games as good for a </v>

45
00:02:58.481 --> 00:03:00.700
<v Speaker 1>country's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as people say,</v>

46
00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:01.653
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer these </v>

47
00:03:02.861 --> 00:03:05.110
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we always do,</v>

48
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.243
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First back at the history Olympic </v>

49
00:03:10.211 --> 00:03:11.044
<v Speaker 1>fallacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few things spark national pride </v>

50
00:03:13.511 --> 00:03:16.120
<v Speaker 1>quite as much as the Olympic Games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

51
00:03:16.121 --> 00:03:16.954
<v Speaker 1>we all like to brag about the gold </v>
<v Speaker 1>medals on country has less water really </v>

52
00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>inflames patriotism the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming an Olympic host.</v>

53
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.980
<v Speaker 1>The excitement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it generates this so big that everyone,</v>

54
00:03:31.981 --> 00:03:32.814
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to think that organizing an event </v>

55
00:03:35.521 --> 00:03:37.680
<v Speaker 1>for this length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country is a good thing,</v>

56
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>but from an economic standpoint,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things up.</v>

57
00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:41.880
<v Speaker 1>Not that clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:03:41.881 --> 00:03:45.450
<v Speaker 1>the arguments in favor of hosting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympic Games are a little bit like,</v>

59
00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:46.800
<v Speaker 1>how should we say?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

60
00:03:46.801 --> 00:03:50.370
<v Speaker 1>there is inconsistent as a tweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

61
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.770
<v Speaker 1>according to a paper from the Bank of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

62
00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:53.663
<v Speaker 1>the effects of the Olympics are so </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive that they can be filled even </v>

63
00:03:56.851 --> 00:03:58.620
<v Speaker 1>before the Olympics takes place.</v>

64
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.070
<v Speaker 1>More specifically the same year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the International Olympic Committee name</v>

65
00:04:07.071 --> 00:04:11.740
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo as the host city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many started to see Japan as the perfect</v>

66
00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:12.574
<v Speaker 1>place for investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember that we're talking about a </v>

67
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:18.660
<v Speaker 1>paper from an institution as prestigious</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the Bank of Japan.</v>

68
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:19.553
<v Speaker 1>This is basically the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to the American Federal </v>

69
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.491
<v Speaker 1>Reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That said,</v>

70
00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:24.324
<v Speaker 1>one of their main arguments is that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>your city gets to the common Olympic </v>

71
00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:29.400
<v Speaker 1>host,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole country can join all those big</v>

72
00:04:29.401 --> 00:04:31.830
<v Speaker 1>organizations that every country wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be a member of.</v>

73
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.200
<v Speaker 1>So how about an example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.510
<v Speaker 1>Barcelona got the nomination in 1986.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some theme that very same.</v>

75
00:04:36.511 --> 00:04:38.070
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain joined the EU.</v>

76
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.083
<v Speaker 1>Beijing was nominated in 2001 and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>again they joined the World Trade </v>

77
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.553
<v Speaker 1>Organization that very year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like this line of reasoning is </v>

78
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:45.804
<v Speaker 1>pretty bulletproof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a second because this </v>

79
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:51.210
<v Speaker 1>is a textbook example of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>called correlation fallacy.</v>

80
00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:52.223
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Spain joined the EU the </v>

81
00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:54.713
<v Speaker 1>same year the Barcelona got chosen as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Olympic host does not mean that the </v>

82
00:04:58.141 --> 00:04:59.700
<v Speaker 1>one thing caused the other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

83
00:04:59.701 --> 00:05:03.780
<v Speaker 1>Portugal also joined the EU in the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and they didn't post anything</v>

84
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.640
<v Speaker 1>and the same will happen with China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

85
00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:10.503
<v Speaker 1>other Asian countries joined the WTO </v>
<v Speaker 1>without organizing benny sporting </v>

86
00:05:13.391 --> 00:05:14.350
<v Speaker 1>events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

87
00:05:14.351 --> 00:05:15.440
<v Speaker 1>just hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's like,</v>

88
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.470
<v Speaker 1>probably know what you're thinking right</v>
<v Speaker 1>about now when you're probably thinking,</v>

89
00:05:17.471 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hey Simon,</v>

90
00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:20.290
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about other international attention</v>

91
00:05:20.291 --> 00:05:21.124
<v Speaker 1>that the Olympic Games can bring?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean for two whole weeks the whole </v>

92
00:05:23.111 --> 00:05:25.100
<v Speaker 1>world is going to have their eyes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan.</v>

93
00:05:25.101 --> 00:05:26.710
<v Speaker 1>That's got to be a good thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice,</v>

94
00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.540
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about the biggest sporting</v>

95
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.250
<v Speaker 1>event in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:31.233
<v Speaker 1>maybe not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you see the London Olympics in </v>

97
00:05:32.711 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a pretty average audience.</v>

98
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:37.450
<v Speaker 1>I mean around 31 million Americans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To you,</v>

99
00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.660
<v Speaker 3>it's</v>

100
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:44.493
<v Speaker 1>making comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is twice as much as an episode of </v>

101
00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Speaker 1>game of thrones and that wasn't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>being regarded as bas,</v>

102
00:05:49.741 --> 00:05:51.870
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what about the rest of the Games now?</v>

103
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:52.733
<v Speaker 1>The Olympics in 2014 didn't even have 22</v>
<v Speaker 1>million viewers in the United States in </v>

104
00:05:56.791 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Rio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 16.</v>

105
00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:58.833
<v Speaker 1>I was just 26 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now these numbers might look quite </v>

106
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:04.040
<v Speaker 1>big to you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's really nothing if we compare it</v>

107
00:06:04.041 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 1>to a much cheaper events like the super </v>
<v Speaker 1>bowl.</v>

108
00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:10.023
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.770
<v Speaker 1>The 2016 superbowl surpassed a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 10 million viewers.</v>

110
00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.753
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though the Olympics or watched all </v>

111
00:06:17.561 --> 00:06:19.330
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you look at the audience,</v>

112
00:06:19.331 --> 00:06:20.164
<v Speaker 1>country by country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the figures aren't really that </v>

113
00:06:21.641 --> 00:06:22.474
<v Speaker 1>impressive and this means that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>perception people have about that </v>

114
00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:25.773
<v Speaker 1>country doesn't really change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state doesn't really seem to change </v>

115
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:29.823
<v Speaker 1>for the good.</v>

116
00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 2>A study of the impact of the 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics in Sydney.</v>

117
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.953
<v Speaker 2>Australian researchers interviewed </v>
<v Speaker 2>people one year before and after the </v>

118
00:06:39.681 --> 00:06:44.360
<v Speaker 2>games they found a little change in </v>
<v Speaker 2>perceptions with one surprising wrinkle.</v>

119
00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:45.403
<v Speaker 2>South Africans were displeased with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Australia because of the way in which </v>

120
00:06:49.401 --> 00:06:53.930
<v Speaker 2>the aboriginal issue was highlighted and</v>
<v Speaker 2>portrayed by the South African.</v>

121
00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.320
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one thing that it seems fair to</v>

122
00:07:01.321 --> 00:07:05.220
<v Speaker 1>agree on Olympic Games do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kickstart your tourism industry.</v>

123
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:06.143
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Tokyo was chosen as the Olympic </v>

124
00:07:07.321 --> 00:07:09.900
<v Speaker 1>coast tourism in Japan has absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketed.</v>

125
00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:13.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean they almost didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourists since 2013,</v>

126
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:16.110
<v Speaker 1>but last year they support 24 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

127
00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:18.390
<v Speaker 1>You could say essentially a brand new </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

128
00:07:18.391 --> 00:07:20.790
<v Speaker 1>It's just been born in Japan and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourism.</v>

129
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:26.090
<v Speaker 1>Tourism is an industry that attracts a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of foreign money and our money.</v>

130
00:07:26.431 --> 00:07:27.810
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>got to be a good thing.</v>

131
00:07:27.811 --> 00:07:28.920
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

132
00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:29.873
<v Speaker 1>I can't just hold on a minute because </v>
<v Speaker 1>even these figures that are up for </v>

133
00:07:33.181 --> 00:07:34.950
<v Speaker 1>debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course tourism in Japan,</v>

134
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.843
<v Speaker 1>it's increased a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do you know of some other countries </v>

135
00:07:38.071 --> 00:07:40.440
<v Speaker 1>that also have a booming tourist section</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>

136
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:43.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shelley and Thailand are great examples.</v>

137
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.103
<v Speaker 1>They have grown at a similar rate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan and don't even Google it because </v>

138
00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:47.934
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to tell you right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither of these countries is planning </v>

139
00:07:50.011 --> 00:07:51.780
<v Speaker 1>to host the Olympic Games anytime soon.</v>

140
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:58.090
<v Speaker 1>Did Thailand's example is pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradigmatic.</v>

141
00:07:58.150 --> 00:07:58.983
<v Speaker 1>They get 6 million more tourists than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan each year and they have just </v>

142
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.484
<v Speaker 1>popped population and their tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Grief is directly correlated to that of </v>

143
00:08:06.641 --> 00:08:09.160
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

144
00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:10.053
<v Speaker 1>as Chinese people have more money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to do more sightseeing and </v>

145
00:08:13.630 --> 00:08:14.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do they go?</v>

146
00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:17.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they go to countries that are nearby and</v>

147
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:19.560
<v Speaker 1>it's a beautiful things to see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

148
00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.950
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be thinking,</v>

149
00:08:20.951 --> 00:08:21.784
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if the Olympics aren't as </v>

150
00:08:22.661 --> 00:08:24.550
<v Speaker 1>profitable as they seem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

151
00:08:24.551 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 1>what's the problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Tokyo wants to host the Olympics,</v>

152
00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 1>I mean he doesn't like having a giant </v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium in his city.</v>

153
00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:31.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's inclusive.</v>

154
00:08:31.721 --> 00:08:32.770
<v Speaker 1>Look at that one too.</v>

155
00:08:36.580 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 2>Medalists in spending.</v>

156
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:42.270
<v Speaker 1>Now we all know that the Olympics are </v>
<v Speaker 1>costly from one day to the next.</v>

157
00:08:42.271 --> 00:08:43.104
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically went from not having to have </v>

158
00:08:43.981 --> 00:08:44.814
<v Speaker 1>an Olympic stadiums,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so having to have one which has to hold </v>

159
00:08:46.531 --> 00:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>more than 80,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and also,</v>

160
00:08:48.890 --> 00:08:49.723
<v Speaker 1>I mean they have to impress everyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>with lights and colors and all sorts of </v>

161
00:08:52.291 --> 00:08:54.690
<v Speaker 1>fancy things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't stop there.</v>

162
00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:55.613
<v Speaker 1>I mean they also need other special </v>
<v Speaker 1>venues for the mini competitions that </v>

163
00:08:58.381 --> 00:08:59.214
<v Speaker 1>are held at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Each of the sports has its own </v>

164
00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:02.143
<v Speaker 1>specifications in total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty one venues will need to be built </v>

165
00:09:05.791 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 1>or remodels for the Tokyo 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 summer Olympic Games.</v>

166
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:10.563
<v Speaker 3>Yes.</v>

167
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.273
<v Speaker 1>And then there's a media center and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other giant white elephants ends on top </v>

168
00:09:16.321 --> 00:09:17.850
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the Olympic villa.</v>

169
00:09:17.910 --> 00:09:21.540
<v Speaker 1>The Olympic villa is basically nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>short of a small town where 10,000</v>

170
00:09:21.541 --> 00:09:22.374
<v Speaker 1>athletes are going to live during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Olympics and as you can probably </v>

171
00:09:24.511 --> 00:09:27.120
<v Speaker 1>imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is certainly not going to be cheap.</v>

172
00:09:27.300 --> 00:09:28.133
<v Speaker 1>Now remember at the total cost for this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're supposed to be at six point 5 </v>

173
00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:31.973
<v Speaker 1>billion USD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At least this was the figure given by </v>

174
00:09:33.541 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 1>the local authorities to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>International Olympic Committee in 2013.</v>

175
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.873
<v Speaker 1>But as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theories are one thing and reality is </v>

176
00:09:41.851 --> 00:09:43.380
<v Speaker 1>something completely different.</v>

177
00:09:46.180 --> 00:09:50.610
<v Speaker 2>Pure 20,</v>
<v Speaker 2>20 Olympic Games costs just keep rising.</v>

178
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:51.573
<v Speaker 1>By December 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo City Hall had already spent over </v>

179
00:09:54.401 --> 00:09:55.234
<v Speaker 1>$12,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just a couple of months later the </v>

180
00:09:58.991 --> 00:09:59.824
<v Speaker 1>local authorities report is that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>would end up spending a whopping figure </v>

181
00:10:03.340 --> 00:10:04.173
<v Speaker 1>of at least $20,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and is even possible that this figure </v>

182
00:10:07.511 --> 00:10:11.080
<v Speaker 1>will keep rising before they even begin </v>
<v Speaker 1>to burn the Olympic flame.</v>

183
00:10:11.470 --> 00:10:13.630
<v Speaker 1>But I mean none of this is really a </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise</v>

184
00:10:13.780 --> 00:10:18.100
<v Speaker 2>since he can remember every Olympic game</v>
<v Speaker 2>has had significant cost overruns.</v>

185
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:22.633
<v Speaker 2>Rio De Janeiro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 ended up costing 51 percent more </v>

186
00:10:26.331 --> 00:10:30.170
<v Speaker 2>than expected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the record so far is Montreal.</v>

187
00:10:30.171 --> 00:10:31.004
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 76,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which costs 700 percent more than was </v>

188
00:10:34.431 --> 00:10:36.290
<v Speaker 2>initially budgeted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>

189
00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:38.530
<v Speaker 2>Eight times more than what was first </v>
<v Speaker 2>planned.</v>

190
00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:39.980
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so now you might be wondering,</v>

191
00:10:39.981 --> 00:10:40.700
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how these</v>

192
00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:41.533
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars really all that much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money for a big governments and you </v>

193
00:10:45.141 --> 00:10:47.360
<v Speaker 1>compared with normal spending in a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>city whole,</v>

194
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:49.490
<v Speaker 1>is that actually a lot of money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

195
00:10:49.491 --> 00:10:50.324
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is an absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>resounding yes for better understanding </v>

196
00:10:53.751 --> 00:10:56.900
<v Speaker 1>with $20 million US dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could build a highway that connected</v>

197
00:10:56.901 --> 00:11:01.790
<v Speaker 1>the extreme north of Japan to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme south and that really isn't even</v>

198
00:11:01.791 --> 00:11:06.791
<v Speaker 1>the worst of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see an apple for a highway.</v>

199
00:11:08.511 --> 00:11:12.770
<v Speaker 1>It can ends up being a waste of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still you can always reutilize this.</v>

200
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:13.663
<v Speaker 1>A country with best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>better infrastructure and communication </v>

201
00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:17.690
<v Speaker 1>can have better companies in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brand new industries,</v>

202
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.290
<v Speaker 1>a better public services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you get with an Olympic stadium?</v>

203
00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:22.610
<v Speaker 1>The Coin Heist?</v>
<v Speaker 1>80,000</v>

204
00:11:22.611 --> 00:11:23.660
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:26.180
<v Speaker 1>if we look at past examples of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to that question,</v>

206
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.073
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty bleak.</v>

207
00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Olympic venues already falling into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>state of disrepair.</v>

208
00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.870
<v Speaker 1>The Rio de Janeiro example is </v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly harsh.</v>

209
00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:37.793
<v Speaker 1>Despite hosting the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They still have entire neighborhoods </v>

210
00:11:40.710 --> 00:11:44.970
<v Speaker 1>that aren't even connected to the city </v>
<v Speaker 1>center by a bus line and the place where</v>

211
00:11:44.971 --> 00:11:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the Olympic villa was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

212
00:11:46.221 --> 00:11:49.950
<v Speaker 1>that's becoming a slum and this is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only example.</v>

213
00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 2>Athens Olympic in ruins 10 years on from</v>
<v Speaker 2>the 2004 games.</v>

214
00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:57.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

215
00:11:58.020 --> 00:11:58.853
<v Speaker 1>and then you've got to add to all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this that Japan is the most indebted </v>

216
00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:01.674
<v Speaker 1>country on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They owe us some equivalent to 130 </v>

217
00:12:04.231 --> 00:12:05.064
<v Speaker 1>percent of their GDP to government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>already struggling to pay retirement </v>

218
00:12:07.561 --> 00:12:08.394
<v Speaker 1>pensions and they've already been two </v>
<v Speaker 1>years without any economic growth </v>

219
00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:12.443
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever,</v>

220
00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:17.713
<v Speaker 1>but now I would say what to you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the Tokyo Olympics in </v>

221
00:12:20.361 --> 00:12:24.320
<v Speaker 1>2020 will mean the ruin of Japan or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe against the odds?</v>

222
00:12:24.321 --> 00:12:25.154
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Japan will benefit from </v>
<v Speaker 1>hosting the events while please leave </v>
