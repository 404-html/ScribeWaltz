1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>Ostentatious exaggerated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>colossal big themes that Dubai always </v>

2
00:00:03.571 --> 00:00:05.420
<v Speaker 1>aspires to carry out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest,</v>

3
00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.210
<v Speaker 1>most luxurious and most eccentric </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects in the world.</v>

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.270
<v Speaker 1>Small territory we can find the tallest </v>
<v Speaker 1>building,</v>

5
00:00:18.271 --> 00:00:19.104
<v Speaker 1>the most luxurious hotel hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the largest international airport </v>

6
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.033
<v Speaker 1>on the planet's located in a strategic </v>
<v Speaker 1>enclave at the mouth of the Persian </v>

7
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.963
<v Speaker 1>Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The growth process of Dubai is one of </v>

8
00:00:28.081 --> 00:00:31.020
<v Speaker 1>the fastest in human history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just over 20 years.</v>

9
00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:34.890
<v Speaker 1>It has gone from being a remote and last</v>
<v Speaker 1>enclave in the desert to becoming one of</v>

10
00:00:34.891 --> 00:00:37.350
<v Speaker 1>the world's great capitals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this period of time,</v>

11
00:00:37.351 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>the Emirates of Dubai has multiplied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>four.</v>

12
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:40.644
<v Speaker 1>It's population by nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of visitors and buying eight </v>

13
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.230
<v Speaker 1>the size of its economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You said that.</v>

14
00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>The question is how has all of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>development been achieved?</v>

15
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>Has it all just been a matter of oil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.560
<v Speaker 1>in this visual politic video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk all about Dubai.</v>

17
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.643
<v Speaker 1>Do you believe is one of the seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>emirates that make up the United Arab </v>

18
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.843
<v Speaker 1>Emirates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could describe it as governments as </v>

19
00:01:11.661 --> 00:01:16.010
<v Speaker 1>an Islamic autocracy that restricts the </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch part of people's civil liberties.</v>

20
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:16.873
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we compare it with neighboring </v>

21
00:01:17.991 --> 00:01:19.130
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do Boeing,</v>

22
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.100
<v Speaker 1>is volume follow the most open place in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East East?</v>

23
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 1>How about some examples?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:30.840
<v Speaker 1>here women can drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The van is not mandatory.</v>

25
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:34.780
<v Speaker 1>You can buy pork at the supermarket and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even alcohol is not hard to come.</v>

26
00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

27
00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.160
<v Speaker 1>things are starting to change in a way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we could refer to this city as a</v>

28
00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:47.960
<v Speaker 1>kind of oasis in the middle of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert and as you can imagine,</v>

29
00:01:47.961 --> 00:01:51.950
<v Speaker 1>all of this change has had its rewards </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well these rewards,</v>

30
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:52.813
<v Speaker 1>they might just surprise you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that to Bonnie is already </v>

31
00:01:55.191 --> 00:01:56.024
<v Speaker 1>the fourth most visited city in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world when it comes to international </v>

32
00:01:58.641 --> 00:01:59.474
<v Speaker 1>visitors and that it surpasses </v>
<v Speaker 1>epicenters of tourism and as global </v>

33
00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:04.550
<v Speaker 1>trade such as New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong or Singapore?</v>

34
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.180
<v Speaker 1>It absolutely is and this is something </v>
<v Speaker 1>that does surprise a lot of people.</v>

35
00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:13.970
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's one thing we have to be clear on</v>

36
00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:14.610
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do buy.</v>

37
00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.180
<v Speaker 1>It does not aspire to be the freest </v>
<v Speaker 1>place on earth,</v>

38
00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:22.181
<v Speaker 1>but they do want to become the richest </v>
<v Speaker 1>was of opulence in this place.</v>

39
00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.043
<v Speaker 1>Also evidence that it's not strange to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see the Dubai police patrolling the </v>

40
00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:32.190
<v Speaker 1>streets in Ferrari's on Lamborghini.</v>

41
00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.930
<v Speaker 2>Where else</v>

42
00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.960
<v Speaker 1>in the world could you possibly see </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>

43
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:40.610
<v Speaker 1>so you might at this moment would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

44
00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.473
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an easy explanation for all of </v>

45
00:02:42.951 --> 00:02:45.170
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is of course oil.</v>

46
00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.033
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>could it be that Dubai is nothing more </v>

47
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.510
<v Speaker 1>than a dream method is financed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>petro dollars?</v>

48
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although we cannot deny the influence of</v>

49
00:02:52.881 --> 00:02:53.714
<v Speaker 1>black goals here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that the real key to </v>

50
00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>success is very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The secret to Dubai is not oil,</v>

51
00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>but rather its commitment to trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>

52
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.560
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's dive in a little deeper.</v>

53
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.400
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:15.470
<v Speaker 1>enough oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ends of the 19 fifties,</v>

55
00:03:15.581 --> 00:03:19.270
<v Speaker 1>important oil deposits were discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi.</v>

56
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.520
<v Speaker 1>The capital of the Emirates.</v>

57
00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:26.240
<v Speaker 1>Take note it because we're not talking </v>
<v Speaker 1>about some small discovery,</v>

58
00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.110
<v Speaker 1>but an absolutely huge amounts of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea,</v>

59
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.150
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that the wealth of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Emirates,</v>

60
00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.200
<v Speaker 1>they're proven reserves is even greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>than all the reserves in Russia.</v>

61
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:37.990
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the case of Dubai,</v>

62
00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.863
<v Speaker 1>things that were a little bit different,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that this territory was also </v>

63
00:03:41.781 --> 00:03:42.614
<v Speaker 1>graced with the 14 of black goals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's authorities soon realize that </v>

64
00:03:45.831 --> 00:03:50.360
<v Speaker 1>their reserves were much smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 1>those of their compatriots in Abu Dhabi.</v>

65
00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.083
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only surprise us oil today accounts </v>

66
00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:59.570
<v Speaker 1>for less than one in every $100 produced</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Dubai's economy.</v>

67
00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:01.700
<v Speaker 1>So you've probably heard about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>important it is.</v>

68
00:04:01.701 --> 00:04:03.740
<v Speaker 1>Do you diversify it and economy rice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:08.240
<v Speaker 1>that is precisely what Dubai did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They overcame their dependence and their</v>

70
00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.680
<v Speaker 1>addiction to wild.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

71
00:04:09.681 --> 00:04:12.080
<v Speaker 1>this is all very easy to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>

72
00:04:12.081 --> 00:04:13.550
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did they do it?</v>

73
00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:14.443
<v Speaker 1>What did you do to achieve such </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments can achieve a higher </v>

74
00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>standard of living even compared to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil rich natives.</v>

75
00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically what it did was attract a </v>

76
00:04:26.651 --> 00:04:27.484
<v Speaker 1>whole bunch of multinationals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals from all around the world </v>

77
00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.443
<v Speaker 1>to achieve this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first thing they did was only low </v>

78
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:36.790
<v Speaker 1>tax policy in Dubai.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no income tax.</v>

79
00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:37.653
<v Speaker 1>The tax on profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's practically nonexistent </v>

80
00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>concurrently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Purchases and not taxed either or the.</v>

81
00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.143
<v Speaker 1>The latter is about to change as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of a joint agreement between all </v>

82
00:04:45.671 --> 00:04:47.920
<v Speaker 1>members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 1>Council.</v>

83
00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:50.650
<v Speaker 1>Tax on purchases will soon be launched,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however,</v>

84
00:04:50.651 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>the rate is only going to be about five </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

85
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:53.104
<v Speaker 1>which is significantly lower than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates we see in developed countries </v>

86
00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:57.070
<v Speaker 1>which tend to be around 18 percent.</v>

87
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:07.290
<v Speaker 1>Of course in case you were wondering in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai that are no taxes on gasoline.</v>

88
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.213
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know it almost seems like we're </v>

89
00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.350
<v Speaker 1>talking about another planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rice,</v>

90
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:15.120
<v Speaker 1>but do not think that low taxes are the </v>
<v Speaker 1>only strategy that Dubai has follows not</v>

91
00:05:15.121 --> 00:05:15.954
<v Speaker 1>at all in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds and perhaps even more important </v>

92
00:05:17.791 --> 00:05:20.280
<v Speaker 1>than taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You buying his resorted to an instrument</v>

93
00:05:20.281 --> 00:05:23.490
<v Speaker 1>known as a special economic zones like </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

94
00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.353
<v Speaker 1>they are somewhat different to the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can find elsewhere in the wells and </v>

95
00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 1>do these special areas in addition to </v>
<v Speaker 1>having tax benefits,</v>

96
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:33.210
<v Speaker 1>even have their own regulations almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>lost,</v>

97
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:37.200
<v Speaker 1>which as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are always focused on promoting business</v>

98
00:05:37.201 --> 00:05:39.870
<v Speaker 1>activity precisely thanks to you having </v>
<v Speaker 1>specific rules.</v>

99
00:05:39.871 --> 00:05:40.704
<v Speaker 1>Companies can escape the rigidity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal systems that are inspired by </v>

100
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:47.040
<v Speaker 1>Sharia law applies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

101
00:05:47.041 --> 00:05:48.210
<v Speaker 1>to the rest of the Emirates,</v>

102
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.993
<v Speaker 1>we can find a good example of this model</v>
<v Speaker 1>in these so called Dubai international </v>

103
00:05:56.691 --> 00:05:57.524
<v Speaker 1>financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is almost a states within another </v>

104
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:01.910
<v Speaker 1>state look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this financial center,</v>

105
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:04.400
<v Speaker 1>it even has its own judicial system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chad,</v>

106
00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:05.293
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by a British judge and it even has its </v>

107
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 1>own official language which is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabic but English and it's also </v>

108
00:06:11.121 --> 00:06:13.730
<v Speaker 1>replaced the local currency with the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar.</v>

109
00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.590
<v Speaker 1>In this way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a financial institution.</v>

110
00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:16.700
<v Speaker 1>The bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

111
00:06:16.701 --> 00:06:19.160
<v Speaker 1>can do business as if it was in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Manhattan,</v>

112
00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:22.590
<v Speaker 1>are benefiting from the tax advantages </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Dubai.</v>

113
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.460
<v Speaker 1>A lot of our deals</v>

114
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.293
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

115
00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:30.970
<v Speaker 1>Well now we can probably understand how </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai has managed to attract most of the</v>

116
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.833
<v Speaker 1>25 largest banks in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not all along with the low </v>

117
00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:36.274
<v Speaker 1>taxes and special economic zones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai has also opted for a very high </v>

118
00:06:39.521 --> 00:06:42.280
<v Speaker 1>degree of immigration freedom and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>result of all this,</v>

119
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>96 percent of its inhabitants,</v>

120
00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.040
<v Speaker 1>they've been born a boy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wait a second,</v>

121
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:53.850
<v Speaker 1>because there is still more now to </v>
<v Speaker 1>further boost foreign investments.</v>

122
00:06:53.851 --> 00:06:54.684
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of this century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dubai authorities made an </v>

123
00:06:56.790 --> 00:06:59.670
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented decision for this corner </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world,</v>

124
00:07:04.360 --> 00:07:05.193
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

125
00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:06.033
<v Speaker 1>Being bold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments of Dubai approved a risky </v>

126
00:07:11.761 --> 00:07:14.790
<v Speaker 1>decree that's announced any foreigner </v>
<v Speaker 1>regardless of their religion,</v>

127
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:17.580
<v Speaker 1>to make real estate investments at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>

128
00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.920
<v Speaker 1>the authentic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it really began.</v>

129
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 1>I was full of buildings and large </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects,</v>

130
00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.960
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic shopping centers,</v>

131
00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:31.033
<v Speaker 1>even it's famous artificial islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the demand for Dubai became </v>

132
00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:35.233
<v Speaker 1>absolutely global.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the fact that since 2002 Dubai has </v>

133
00:07:38.061 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 1>experienced real estate developments </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparable only to that of Shanghai City</v>

134
00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.090
<v Speaker 1>with 13 times more</v>

135
00:07:48.370 --> 00:07:49.020
<v Speaker 2>indeed,</v>

136
00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:49.853
<v Speaker 1>one of the most surprising things about </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai is that it has a population of </v>

137
00:07:52.451 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 1>less than 3 million inhabitants just </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this,</v>

138
00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.490
<v Speaker 1>where before there were only a handful </v>
<v Speaker 1>of skyscrapers.</v>

139
00:07:57.491 --> 00:07:58.324
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to this decree that are now </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds and huge projects are </v>

140
00:08:01.091 --> 00:08:02.830
<v Speaker 1>announced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one after the other.</v>

141
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this new skyscrapers,</v>

142
00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:05.890
<v Speaker 1>ferris wheels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>theme parks,</v>

143
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:07.570
<v Speaker 1>whatever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of these latest projects,</v>

144
00:08:07.571 --> 00:08:09.820
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is known as the mall of the wealth.</v>

145
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:13.890
<v Speaker 1>It's a gigantic space designed to become</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest shopping center in the world</v>

146
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:14.743
<v Speaker 1>hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will even has its own cultural </v>

147
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:18.190
<v Speaker 1>districts with dozens of theaters and </v>
<v Speaker 1>cinemas.</v>

148
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.083
<v Speaker 1>100 hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest indoor theme park in the </v>

149
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:22.594
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The project has been presented as the </v>

150
00:08:24.071 --> 00:08:27.130
<v Speaker 1>world's first city with a temperature </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled environment.</v>

151
00:08:37.850 --> 00:08:38.230
<v Speaker 2>All</v>

152
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.063
<v Speaker 1>of these measures have made Dubai a </v>
<v Speaker 1>place where it is easy to do business </v>

153
00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.230
<v Speaker 1>until he turns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mrs into a commercial,</v>

154
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:46.450
<v Speaker 1>touristic financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logistical,</v>

155
00:08:46.540 --> 00:08:48.700
<v Speaker 1>and Steven industrial power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

156
00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:53.140
<v Speaker 1>Anyone who thinks that all Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isabel is banks and hotels is very,</v>

157
00:08:53.141 --> 00:08:56.700
<v Speaker 1>very wrong nowadays.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai largely thanks to its modern ports</v>

158
00:08:56.701 --> 00:09:00.800
<v Speaker 1>and special zones is the third largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>exporting power in the world ends.</v>

159
00:09:00.801 --> 00:09:04.260
<v Speaker 1>It's industrial production exceeds </v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000,000,000.</v>

160
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:05.243
<v Speaker 1>Every single.</v>

161
00:09:05.350 --> 00:09:06.183
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

162
00:09:11.190 --> 00:09:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Is what explains why its neighbors are </v>
<v Speaker 1>on easily watching any fall in the price</v>

163
00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:15.594
<v Speaker 1>of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the government of Dubai continues </v>

164
00:09:17.101 --> 00:09:17.934
<v Speaker 1>to carry out and large projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true from a strictly political </v>

165
00:09:20.521 --> 00:09:21.354
<v Speaker 1>points of view that there aren't many </v>
<v Speaker 1>reprehensible elements when it comes to </v>

166
00:09:23.611 --> 00:09:26.100
<v Speaker 1>religious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social or human rights issues.</v>

167
00:09:26.130 --> 00:09:28.500
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that all the painful conditions suffered</v>

168
00:09:28.501 --> 00:09:31.230
<v Speaker 1>by many construction workers from </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries such as India,</v>

169
00:09:31.231 --> 00:09:32.610
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Pakistan.</v>

170
00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:34.710
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course we cannot ignore this reality,</v>

171
00:09:34.711 --> 00:09:35.544
<v Speaker 1>but we cannot not pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>achievements of this emeris among other </v>

172
00:09:39.181 --> 00:09:40.200
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because of this growth,</v>

173
00:09:40.201 --> 00:09:41.034
<v Speaker 1>divine has managed to influence the </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies of its neighbors and they are </v>

174
00:09:43.681 --> 00:09:45.990
<v Speaker 1>beginning to reduce their dependence on </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil as well.</v>

175
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:47.930
<v Speaker 1>Dubai is quite simply a great model.</v>

176
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Consider it,</v>

177
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:53.353
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new Saudi Arabia onto Mohammed bin </v>

178
00:09:55.460 --> 00:09:56.293
<v Speaker 1>Salman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something we actually spoke </v>

179
00:09:56.721 --> 00:09:58.760
<v Speaker 1>about in a previous video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

180
00:09:58.850 --> 00:10:01.730
<v Speaker 1>I think this case puts a very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>question on the table.</v>

181
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:02.593
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to reconcile the absence </v>
<v Speaker 1>of civil rights with sustainable </v>

182
00:10:06.021 --> 00:10:07.460
<v Speaker 1>economic growth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overtime?</v>

183
00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:11.930
<v Speaker 1>No history and empirical evidence seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to show that this is not the case,</v>

184
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:12.823
<v Speaker 1>but in a world increasingly pressured by</v>
<v Speaker 1>very high taxes and regulations of all </v>

185
00:10:16.221 --> 00:10:17.054
<v Speaker 1>kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dubai's authorities seem intent on </v>

186
00:10:19.011 --> 00:10:22.410
<v Speaker 1>demonstrating that this time it will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible at the moment.</v>

187
00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:23.263
<v Speaker 1>Spitz commitment to free trade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments and its policies aimed at </v>

188
00:10:25.341 --> 00:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>strengthening legal security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ease of doing business and keeping taxes</v>

189
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:30.740
<v Speaker 1>low have been supportive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If anything,</v>

190
00:10:30.741 --> 00:10:31.574
<v Speaker 1>do you buy shoes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the competitiveness and trade tend </v>

191
00:10:33.051 --> 00:10:33.884
<v Speaker 1>to have better results in terms of </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments than protectionism or </v>

192
00:10:36.321 --> 00:10:37.154
<v Speaker 1>subsidies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many rules should pay attention to the </v>

193
00:10:38.931 --> 00:10:42.420
<v Speaker 1>successes of this oasis in the desert,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's our opinion here,</v>

194
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.273
<v Speaker 1>visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we'd love to know what you </v>

195
00:10:44.451 --> 00:10:45.284
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the divine model will make </v>

196
00:10:46.341 --> 00:10:48.140
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East a freer place?</v>
