1
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.023
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

2
00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.163
<v Speaker 2>we may not like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but we can't see that corruption in </v>

3
00:00:11.701 --> 00:00:14.550
<v Speaker 2>Argentina bans in most countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is anything new?</v>

4
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.443
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that since the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>government meeting back in 1810 </v>

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:22.080
<v Speaker 2>virtually no Argentine government has </v>
<v Speaker 2>been free of suspicion.</v>

6
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.460
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

7
00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.180
<v Speaker 2>Possibilities are almost endless and the</v>
<v Speaker 2>incentives are very,</v>

8
00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.043
<v Speaker 2>very generous.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't think it's just a matter of </v>

9
00:00:33.641 --> 00:00:37.480
<v Speaker 2>sticking your hands in and your done </v>
<v Speaker 2>because most corruption cases,</v>

10
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.420
<v Speaker 2>they're far more convoluted than this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

11
00:00:40.421 --> 00:00:43.720
<v Speaker 2>what has been uncovered in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it does go much,</v>

12
00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.240
<v Speaker 2>much further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the realization that</v>

13
00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:47.074
<v Speaker 2>in Argentina there has been a systematic</v>
<v Speaker 2>process led by the nation's own </v>

14
00:00:50.291 --> 00:00:51.124
<v Speaker 2>government with the object of looting,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country's public treasury on a far </v>

15
00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.563
<v Speaker 2>larger scale,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and we don't talking about the </v>

16
00:01:00.471 --> 00:01:01.304
<v Speaker 2>occasional bribe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but billions of dollars that given the </v>

17
00:01:03.261 --> 00:01:06.650
<v Speaker 2>evidence seemed to have been stolen </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the Peronist governments of Nesta</v>

18
00:01:06.651 --> 00:01:08.880
<v Speaker 2>catch now and Cristina Fernandez de </v>
<v Speaker 2>coach.</v>

19
00:01:08.881 --> 00:01:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more news comes almost daily,</v>

20
00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:15.680
<v Speaker 2>but the goal of this video is to tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>you how it all started,</v>

21
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.240
<v Speaker 2>what happens and how this plot worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A plots which the very presidency of the</v>

22
00:01:20.241 --> 00:01:23.480
<v Speaker 2>republic was involved in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as dozens of politicians,</v>

23
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:24.710
<v Speaker 2>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>officials,</v>

24
00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.320
<v Speaker 2>and as many of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>businessmen in the country.</v>

25
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.543
<v Speaker 2>This looting operations plus known as </v>
<v Speaker 2>the notebooks began with the arrival of </v>

26
00:01:34.911 --> 00:01:35.744
<v Speaker 2>Nesta coachnet in May of 2003 and </v>
<v Speaker 2>continued under the presidency of his </v>

27
00:01:38.871 --> 00:01:39.704
<v Speaker 2>wife Cristina Fernandez.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The catch now until 2015 that is to say </v>

28
00:01:43.071 --> 00:01:46.880
<v Speaker 2>the systematic pillaging of the public </v>
<v Speaker 2>coffers happens for more than a decade.</v>

29
00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:47.773
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before we look into what this consisted </v>

30
00:01:48.951 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 2>of and how much money it meant for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>origin times,</v>

31
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.210
<v Speaker 2>we have to answer some questions about </v>
<v Speaker 2>the real protagonists of this story,</v>

32
00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.160
<v Speaker 2>the consciousness we need to look at who</v>
<v Speaker 2>they are,</v>

33
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 2>how they got into power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how have they managed to set up what</v>

34
00:02:01.041 --> 00:02:01.874
<v Speaker 2>is perhaps the biggest operation in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>history of stealing from Argentina's </v>

35
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.710
<v Speaker 2>public coffers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So listen up.</v>

36
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.213
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

37
00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:16.773
<v Speaker 2>Kerschner is a sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>provincial politicians who managed to </v>

38
00:02:21.761 --> 00:02:22.594
<v Speaker 2>own Argentina for years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it all began with a beautiful love </v>

39
00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:27.940
<v Speaker 2>story between two young university </v>
<v Speaker 2>students,</v>

40
00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.063
<v Speaker 2>Nesta.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm Christina Matt in the mid seventies </v>

41
00:02:31.571 --> 00:02:35.110
<v Speaker 2>while studying at the National </v>
<v Speaker 2>University of La Plaza in Buenos Aires,</v>

42
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.003
<v Speaker 2>love as soon blooms and in 1976 after </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military coup led by left Tenant </v>

43
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:40.413
<v Speaker 2>General Jorge at Rafael v dealer or two </v>
<v Speaker 2>lovers decided to leave and work as </v>

44
00:02:44.231 --> 00:02:48.250
<v Speaker 2>lawyers in the city of Rio gay golf's in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the province of Santa Cruz,</v>

45
00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:49.173
<v Speaker 2>a city Bonnie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the way that is far away from the </v>

46
00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:51.911
<v Speaker 2>capitol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

47
00:02:51.911 --> 00:02:54.730
<v Speaker 2>it's more than 2,650 kilometers away.</v>

48
00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.450
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If</v>

49
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:59.650
<v Speaker 2>we had been asked about that couples </v>
<v Speaker 2>particular future at that time,</v>

50
00:02:59.651 --> 00:03:03.130
<v Speaker 2>we probably wouldn't have mentioned </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything about national politics.</v>

51
00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.993
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after democracy returned in 1983 this </v>

52
00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:06.874
<v Speaker 2>nice lawyer couple joins the Peronist </v>
<v Speaker 2>party and it was their folks that the </v>

53
00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.050
<v Speaker 2>career of those who became Argentina's </v>
<v Speaker 2>underwood's ready began.</v>

54
00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now that we actually think about it,</v>

55
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.084
<v Speaker 2>it was probably the underwoods who </v>
<v Speaker 2>became the consciousness of the </v>

56
00:03:18.251 --> 00:03:19.084
<v Speaker 2>political series.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a relationship made by and four </v>

57
00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:26.030
<v Speaker 2>power first in 1987 Nesta catch no was </v>
<v Speaker 2>elected mayor of Rio de.</v>

58
00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:30.730
<v Speaker 2>I'll send a few years later in 1991 </v>
<v Speaker 2>governor of the province of Santa Cruz.</v>

59
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.593
<v Speaker 2>Then finally in 2003 he became president</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Republic of Argentina and during </v>

60
00:03:38.171 --> 00:03:39.004
<v Speaker 2>this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Christina Fernandez didn't stay on the </v>

61
00:03:40.961 --> 00:03:41.794
<v Speaker 2>sidelines.</v>
<v Speaker 2>She made her career in the legislative </v>

62
00:03:43.211 --> 00:03:44.044
<v Speaker 2>chambers as provincial deputy national </v>
<v Speaker 2>deputy national senator until in 2007 </v>

63
00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.743
<v Speaker 2>she arrived at the presidency of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>republic and then in 2015 she went back </v>

64
00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:55.660
<v Speaker 2>to the Senate.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

65
00:03:55.661 --> 00:03:57.460
<v Speaker 2>it seems like the couch and has had it </v>
<v Speaker 2>very,</v>

66
00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.130
<v Speaker 2>very clear between the legal profession </v>
<v Speaker 2>and politics,</v>

67
00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.700
<v Speaker 2>politics more than 30 years of living </v>
<v Speaker 2>off taxpayers,</v>

68
00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.620
<v Speaker 2>certainly something of a career.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

69
00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:06.910
<v Speaker 2>just a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

70
00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.870
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to be not a funny image </v>
<v Speaker 1>need that you see though,</v>

71
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:22.710
<v Speaker 1>if he throws,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello Ziff Santa Cruz,</v>

72
00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.943
<v Speaker 2>which is where the coaching has began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their political career isn't only far </v>

73
00:04:27.831 --> 00:04:30.350
<v Speaker 2>from the capitol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which after all is the center of power.</v>

74
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.630
<v Speaker 2>In 2001 it's population didn't even </v>
<v Speaker 2>reach 200,000 inhabitants.</v>

75
00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.810
<v Speaker 2>It was about 0.5% of the country's </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire population,</v>

76
00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.690
<v Speaker 2>which at the time was approximately 36 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people.</v>

77
00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:44.503
<v Speaker 2>So how did to politicians are a place </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is so far from the core of power </v>

78
00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:51.890
<v Speaker 2>and so small take control of the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

79
00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:52.753
<v Speaker 2>This is the question that many </v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists and political analysts have </v>

80
00:04:55.221 --> 00:04:57.170
<v Speaker 2>been asking for a long time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

81
00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.480
<v Speaker 2>now we're beginning to unravel the </v>
<v Speaker 2>onset.</v>

82
00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this husband and wife duo took over,</v>

83
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.803
<v Speaker 2>co opted and bought almost every sector </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Argentinian politics through the </v>

84
00:05:07.071 --> 00:05:07.970
<v Speaker 2>power of their wallet.</v>

85
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:10.373
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>
<v Speaker 4>look,</v>

86
00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:15.610
<v Speaker 4>grandma,</v>
<v Speaker 4>they didn't know [inaudible]</v>

87
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.990
<v Speaker 2>businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trade unionist,</v>

88
00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 2>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

89
00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:25.083
<v Speaker 2>artists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and civil society leaders succumbed to </v>

90
00:05:26.981 --> 00:05:27.814
<v Speaker 2>the power of the state's wallet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was billions of dollars distributed </v>

91
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 2>among the pockets of those who supported</v>
<v Speaker 2>and his word unconditional supporters of</v>

92
00:05:35.051 --> 00:05:39.580
<v Speaker 2>this peculiar marriage [inaudible] tell </v>
<v Speaker 2>network fed and greased by concessions,</v>

93
00:05:39.581 --> 00:05:40.414
<v Speaker 2>aid and subsidies that were conveniently</v>
<v Speaker 2>distributors and which nobody </v>

94
00:05:43.451 --> 00:05:44.590
<v Speaker 2>controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

95
00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:47.620
<v Speaker 2>the question that we have to ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>ourselves is,</v>

96
00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:48.483
<v Speaker 2>how did they finance it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did the connection is maintained </v>

97
00:05:50.231 --> 00:05:52.160
<v Speaker 2>such an ample wallet?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well listen up,</v>

98
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:53.830
<v Speaker 1>grandmas that to see it.</v>

99
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:00.600
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible]</v>

100
00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:07.230
<v Speaker 2>goal of public works.</v>

101
00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:09.560
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

102
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.831
<v Speaker 2>look,</v>
<v Speaker 2>good.</v>

103
00:06:09.831 --> 00:06:13.760
<v Speaker 2>Watch Cristina Fernandez said in 2010 </v>
<v Speaker 2>for us,</v>

104
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 2>for this administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>public work isn't a contingency.</v>

105
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.373
<v Speaker 2>It's a conviction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a structural political concept that </v>

106
00:06:20.961 --> 00:06:21.794
<v Speaker 2>we've been developing not only since </v>
<v Speaker 2>2003 but since we gained the </v>

107
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:28.550
<v Speaker 2>responsibility of directing a </v>
<v Speaker 2>community's destiny.</v>

108
00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:29.443
<v Speaker 2>Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while now we know why public works were </v>

109
00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:35.330
<v Speaker 2>so important for this marriage and no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sorry,</v>

110
00:06:35.331 --> 00:06:38.240
<v Speaker 2>but it has nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentina's interests.</v>

111
00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 2>Public work was one of the core parts of</v>
<v Speaker 2>the catch in his political fabric,</v>

112
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:46.340
<v Speaker 2>first in the province of Santa Cruz and </v>
<v Speaker 2>then throughout the entire country.</v>

113
00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.510
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of you might be wondering,</v>

114
00:06:47.511 --> 00:06:48.200
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon,</v>

115
00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.390
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How did the system actually work?</v>

116
00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'll see that deep down it was </v>

117
00:06:52.581 --> 00:06:55.790
<v Speaker 2>actually quite simple.</v>
<v Speaker 2>President Kartchner three as minister of</v>

118
00:06:55.791 --> 00:06:58.580
<v Speaker 2>federal planning and public investment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Julio Davido,</v>

119
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:02.300
<v Speaker 2>he stayed in this post for the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>period in which the catch and is headed.</v>

120
00:07:02.301 --> 00:07:03.134
<v Speaker 2>The country met periodically with the </v>
<v Speaker 2>main construction companies in </v>

121
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:06.074
<v Speaker 2>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which in turn were convened by the </v>

122
00:07:08.001 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 2>president of the Chamber of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Construction.</v>

123
00:07:09.801 --> 00:07:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Call us vogner.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

124
00:07:10.971 --> 00:07:11.804
<v Speaker 2>in these meetings,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was agreed exactly which company </v>

125
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.920
<v Speaker 2>would get each public tender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is essentially,</v>

126
00:07:15.921 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 2>they were meeting to decide how to </v>
<v Speaker 2>distribute the case.</v>

127
00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:19.563
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:22.260 --> 00:07:25.590
<v Speaker 2>When everything was decided,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tender procedure actually started,</v>

129
00:07:25.591 --> 00:07:28.020
<v Speaker 2>but this was simply familiar </v>
<v Speaker 2>appearances.</v>

130
00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.883
<v Speaker 2>The company which was chosen was the one</v>
<v Speaker 2>that this kind of public works cartel </v>

131
00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:33.330
<v Speaker 2>had previously.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Agreed.</v>

132
00:07:33.331 --> 00:07:37.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now comes the key to the entire process.</v>

133
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:39.853
<v Speaker 2>Once the work was granted,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the companies charged the first </v>

134
00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:42.494
<v Speaker 2>installment of the contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the advanced payments they needed to </v>

135
00:07:45.290 --> 00:07:47.030
<v Speaker 2>supposedly begin working.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

136
00:07:47.031 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 2>this payments was given in higher lead </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the politicians.</v>

137
00:07:50.810 --> 00:07:52.960
<v Speaker 5>Doris,</v>
<v Speaker 5>they can see me and go,</v>

138
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.290
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible],</v>

139
00:07:59.320 --> 00:08:01.680
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible], [inaudible] else,</v>
<v Speaker 5>you know,</v>

140
00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:03.910
<v Speaker 2>sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on a second.</v>

141
00:08:03.970 --> 00:08:04.803
<v Speaker 2>Where was the business if these </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies had to pay back what they </v>

142
00:08:07.361 --> 00:08:08.410
<v Speaker 2>charged?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

143
00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.510
<v Speaker 2>that was in the extra costs.</v>

144
00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:14.053
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

145
00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:14.913
<v Speaker 2>It's estimated that on average,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each project's extra cost ranged from </v>

146
00:08:17.811 --> 00:08:21.320
<v Speaker 2>between 30 and 40% of the total bill.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That way.</v>

147
00:08:21.321 --> 00:08:22.154
<v Speaker 2>If work was grounded for 100 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>budget expansions were approved for up </v>

148
00:08:25.311 --> 00:08:28.370
<v Speaker 2>to a total of approximately 140 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not all.</v>

149
00:08:28.371 --> 00:08:32.540
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes the government would also </v>
<v Speaker 2>prove changes and new project expansions</v>

150
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:33.403
<v Speaker 2>until the company that had been awarded </v>
<v Speaker 2>the $100 million work ended up charging </v>

151
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.770
<v Speaker 2>a lot more on ac 200 250 million and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even up to 2.8 times the initial budgets</v>

152
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:43.633
<v Speaker 2>because I mean in this example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>280 million and to top it all off at </v>

153
00:08:46.491 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 2>many of these projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't even finished.</v>

154
00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.180
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>

155
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.140
<v Speaker 2>Of course.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In exchange for this bargain,</v>

156
00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:52.993
<v Speaker 2>companies paid bribes to politicians </v>
<v Speaker 2>depending on the case between 10 to 20% </v>

157
00:08:56.671 --> 00:08:58.320
<v Speaker 2>of the invoiced amount.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having said that,</v>

158
00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:01.200
<v Speaker 2>have you ever wanted our public work </v>
<v Speaker 2>functions in your country?</v>

159
00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.680
<v Speaker 2>The thing is that this thing worked </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly for years,</v>

160
00:09:04.681 --> 00:09:06.930
<v Speaker 2>but now while it's been exposed</v>

161
00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:12.110
<v Speaker 6>and did it for 700 book it,</v>
<v Speaker 6>but I said not neglecting him.</v>

162
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.220
<v Speaker 6>[inaudible] seizures in Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Fico,</v>

163
00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:26.591
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>
<v Speaker 6>no,</v>

164
00:09:26.591 --> 00:09:28.000
<v Speaker 6>no.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Why not?</v>

165
00:09:29.900 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

166
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.463
<v Speaker 2>Discovered sole details really counts </v>
<v Speaker 2>out when one doesn't take care of all </v>

167
00:09:38.381 --> 00:09:39.214
<v Speaker 2>the details.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the most complex and ingenious </v>

168
00:09:40.811 --> 00:09:44.350
<v Speaker 2>operations run.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The risk of collapsing this case was not</v>

169
00:09:44.351 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 2>an accent.</v>

170
00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:45.833
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

171
00:09:46.020 --> 00:09:46.853
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it turns out that the driver who </v>

172
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:51.180
<v Speaker 2>transported the government's bribe </v>
<v Speaker 2>collector was obsessed with writing down</v>

173
00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:52.500
<v Speaker 2>each trip,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each stuffed,</v>

174
00:09:52.501 --> 00:09:53.334
<v Speaker 2>each building visitors the name of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>people he was going to see for the </v>

175
00:09:55.590 --> 00:09:58.650
<v Speaker 2>briefcase delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the conversations he had during his</v>

176
00:09:58.651 --> 00:09:59.484
<v Speaker 2>travels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had written down practically </v>

177
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.643
<v Speaker 2>everything in eight notebooks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't know if he did it on impulse </v>

178
00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:06.504
<v Speaker 2>for entertainments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if it was part of the kind of control </v>

179
00:10:07.991 --> 00:10:08.824
<v Speaker 2>and accounting system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or perhaps even simply wanted to cover </v>

180
00:10:10.441 --> 00:10:12.000
<v Speaker 2>his back.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reality is though,</v>

181
00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:15.240
<v Speaker 2>that these notebooks contain all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>details of this matthew,</v>

182
00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:18.673
<v Speaker 2>and finally those new books came into </v>
<v Speaker 2>the hands of a journalist who upon </v>

183
00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.650
<v Speaker 2>seeing what they contained,</v>
<v Speaker 2>decided to turn them over to justice.</v>

184
00:10:24.680 --> 00:10:27.110
<v Speaker 2>And after months of investigation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at the end of July,</v>

185
00:10:27.111 --> 00:10:31.430
<v Speaker 2>2018 high officials and businessmen </v>
<v Speaker 2>linked to this plot where arrested.</v>

186
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:33.320
<v Speaker 2>But that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

187
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:34.183
<v Speaker 2>many of these people have decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborate with the Justice Department </v>

188
00:10:36.800 --> 00:10:37.633
<v Speaker 2>in exchange for benefits such as not </v>
<v Speaker 2>being in prison while the process </v>

189
00:10:40.671 --> 00:10:41.504
<v Speaker 2>continues.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm one of those individuals is Carlos </v>

190
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.623
<v Speaker 2>Wagner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the president of the Chamber of </v>

191
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.970
<v Speaker 2>construction,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the man who called the companies and one</v>

192
00:10:46.971 --> 00:10:49.760
<v Speaker 2>of the people who benefited most from </v>
<v Speaker 2>this entire mass.</v>

193
00:10:49.780 --> 00:10:50.613
<v Speaker 2>His story confirms everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The notebook set and the other </v>

194
00:10:52.821 --> 00:10:55.460
<v Speaker 2>testimonies they went in the same line </v>
<v Speaker 2>right now.</v>

195
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:56.600
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

196
00:10:56.620 --> 00:10:58.880
<v Speaker 2>all right Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but how much money are we really talking</v>

197
00:10:58.881 --> 00:10:59.810
<v Speaker 2>about here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

198
00:10:59.840 --> 00:11:00.673
<v Speaker 2>the reality is it is a ton of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See if Collins Wagner is telling the </v>

199
00:11:03.891 --> 00:11:04.724
<v Speaker 2>truth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the cartoonist would have received </v>

200
00:11:05.510 --> 00:11:10.510
<v Speaker 2>almost $3 million a day and they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>that for that entire 12 and a half years</v>

201
00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:13.364
<v Speaker 2>in government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is more than $12 billion in total </v>

202
00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:18.770
<v Speaker 2>and that's only from the public works,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but something just the public works.</v>

203
00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:22.130
<v Speaker 2>There are many more suspicions of </v>
<v Speaker 2>corruption and pending cases.</v>

204
00:11:24.920 --> 00:11:25.190
<v Speaker 6>Yes,</v>

205
00:11:25.190 --> 00:11:27.620
<v Speaker 2>I actually got $12 billion to pay </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians,</v>

206
00:11:27.621 --> 00:11:28.640
<v Speaker 2>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 2>journalists,</v>

207
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.400
<v Speaker 2>social leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course fill their own pockets.</v>

208
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:32.263
<v Speaker 2>Everything indicates that this is how </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kushners came to power and </v>

209
00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:36.980
<v Speaker 2>consolidated their power over Argentina.</v>

210
00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:40.150
<v Speaker 6>For example,</v>

211
00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:40.983
<v Speaker 2>this will say Jose Lopez case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a format public work secretary and </v>

212
00:11:43.391 --> 00:11:44.224
<v Speaker 2>someone who was very close to Julio to </v>
<v Speaker 2>veto the catch and arrest minister who </v>

213
00:11:47.770 --> 00:11:48.603
<v Speaker 2>managed the plot well in June of 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 2>having been alerted that the police </v>

214
00:11:51.971 --> 00:11:54.220
<v Speaker 2>could rate as house as of an </v>
<v Speaker 2>investigation,</v>

215
00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:55.083
<v Speaker 2>he decided to leave at three in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>morning with $9 billion that he had in </v>

216
00:11:58.091 --> 00:12:00.310
<v Speaker 2>cash hidden under his mattress.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

217
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:01.144
<v Speaker 2>that night,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lopez trying to hide the money in a </v>

218
00:12:02.141 --> 00:12:02.974
<v Speaker 2>confidence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the confidence of the praying and </v>

219
00:12:04.391 --> 00:12:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Pennington nuns of our lady of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rosary of Fatima,</v>

220
00:12:07.390 --> 00:12:10.630
<v Speaker 2>but this didn't have the best of luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lani was stashing the money.</v>

221
00:12:10.631 --> 00:12:14.080
<v Speaker 2>A neighbor who thought that it was a </v>
<v Speaker 2>robbery called the police and that's how</v>

222
00:12:14.081 --> 00:12:17.260
<v Speaker 2>good Aalto seemed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Lopez was caught red handed and yes,</v>

223
00:12:17.261 --> 00:12:18.800
<v Speaker 2>we'd know where all that money probably </v>
<v Speaker 2>came.</v>

224
00:12:18.801 --> 00:12:23.801
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

225
00:12:24.381 --> 00:12:27.050
<v Speaker 2>this money couldn't simply be </v>
<v Speaker 2>transferred to a bank.</v>

226
00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:28.850
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it had to be paid in cash so it wouldn't</v>

227
00:12:28.851 --> 00:12:31.490
<v Speaker 2>leave a trace.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was moved in bags.</v>

228
00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:33.140
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since they made so many payments,</v>

229
00:12:33.141 --> 00:12:33.974
<v Speaker 2>the people in charge of filling the bags</v>
<v Speaker 2>already knew how many money wads fit </v>

230
00:12:36.711 --> 00:12:39.590
<v Speaker 2>into each bag.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it seems that the money was no longer</v>

231
00:12:39.591 --> 00:12:42.440
<v Speaker 2>counted in millions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but simply by number of bags.</v>

232
00:12:44.930 --> 00:12:45.763
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

233
00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:48.920
<v Speaker 2>Do not forget the companies also made </v>
<v Speaker 2>money by overpricing.</v>

234
00:12:48.921 --> 00:12:52.400
