1
00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.953
<v Speaker 1>Question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can a poor country reasonably aspire to </v>

2
00:00:14.641 --> 00:00:18.060
<v Speaker 1>become a high income one within a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years?</v>

3
00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.940
<v Speaker 1>Second question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much time would they really need?</v>

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:22.890
<v Speaker 1>And third question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how would they do it?</v>

5
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:24.373
<v Speaker 1>These are some of the most common </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions that you send us pill on this </v>

6
00:00:28.231 --> 00:00:30.570
<v Speaker 1>channel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've seen in various videos how several</v>

7
00:00:30.571 --> 00:00:32.620
<v Speaker 1>countries have managed to change that </v>
<v Speaker 1>luck.</v>

8
00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.570
<v Speaker 1>It's become locomotive swells of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video I want to tell you about a</v>

9
00:00:36.571 --> 00:00:37.404
<v Speaker 1>very particular case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to tell you about Poland's </v>

10
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:41.760
<v Speaker 1>because Poland's becoming something of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new Germany.</v>

11
00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>

12
00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.800
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question for you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andy.</v>

13
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.900
<v Speaker 1>As always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>please do not google.</v>

14
00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>Which do you think is the city with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most Polish inhabitants,</v>

15
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>Warsaw and Krakow?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually it would be Chicago.</v>

17
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.020
<v Speaker 1>2 million Polish people live in Chicago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

18
00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:09.150
<v Speaker 1>We own really not getting here.</v>

19
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Give you a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not been easy for polls.</v>

20
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.320
<v Speaker 1>During the Second World War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland was the country that suffered the</v>

21
00:01:18.321 --> 00:01:20.180
<v Speaker 1>most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No less than one.</v>

22
00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.110
<v Speaker 1>Out of every five poles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's almost 6 million people,</v>

23
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>which is the conservative estimate by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way,</v>

24
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.340
<v Speaker 1>lost their lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then after that disaster,</v>

25
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:29.174
<v Speaker 1>they endured 44 years of a communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments who in addition to exerting </v>

26
00:01:32.991 --> 00:01:33.824
<v Speaker 1>an enormous amount of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>repression also left them as a poor </v>

27
00:01:36.531 --> 00:01:41.120
<v Speaker 1>country in 1989 when the system came to </v>
<v Speaker 1>an end,</v>

28
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.973
<v Speaker 1>Poland's per capita income was between </v>
<v Speaker 1>three and five times smaller than that </v>

29
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:48.020
<v Speaker 1>of developed countries such as Italy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

30
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 1>or the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a second because things</v>

31
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:52.003
<v Speaker 1>they've really changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portland's a country located halfway </v>

32
00:01:58.451 --> 00:01:59.284
<v Speaker 1>between Paris and Moscow and has $40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants completely changed </v>

33
00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:03.663
<v Speaker 1>its model and since they've done this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very economy has grown by over four </v>

34
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.080
<v Speaker 1>percent every year.</v>

35
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:08.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

36
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.650
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be thinking,</v>

37
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.513
<v Speaker 1>did I just put too much emphasis on four</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent a year because it doesn't sound </v>

38
00:02:19.831 --> 00:02:21.290
<v Speaker 1>that impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is.</v>

39
00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:22.143
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you compare it to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty crazy growth rates that you can </v>

40
00:02:24.661 --> 00:02:27.830
<v Speaker 1>see in the Asian tigers for present kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of sounds like a drake,</v>

41
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:28.740
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well folks,</v>

42
00:02:28.741 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>if you are thinking that you are missing</v>
<v Speaker 1>a couple of important things,</v>

43
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.410
<v Speaker 2>details</v>

44
00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.423
<v Speaker 1>is that we're talking about almost 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years of uninterrupted economic growth </v>

45
00:02:43.491 --> 00:02:44.324
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even the great crisis of 2008 and </v>

46
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.700
<v Speaker 1>2009 really affected this country at </v>
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>

47
00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.480
<v Speaker 1>We can say the ponens moving kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a giant cargo ship.</v>

48
00:02:52.481 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>It's not the fastest ship on the water </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure,</v>

49
00:02:54.941 --> 00:02:55.774
<v Speaker 1>but it has moved and incredible distance</v>
<v Speaker 1>another way young Polish people have </v>

50
00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:06.180
<v Speaker 1>pretty much no idea what an economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis is like.</v>

51
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.240
<v Speaker 1>The second detail is also very important</v>
<v Speaker 1>to it because I'm like,</v>

52
00:03:16.241 --> 00:03:17.074
<v Speaker 1>what happens with the Asian Tigers?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland's has had this huge growth while </v>

53
00:03:20.591 --> 00:03:21.424
<v Speaker 1>being a consolidated democracy and by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the way that really kind of dispels and </v>

54
00:03:25.451 --> 00:03:26.284
<v Speaker 1>important myth here and that's that </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries need a strong hands in order </v>

55
00:03:29.471 --> 00:03:32.710
<v Speaker 1>to grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>

56
00:03:32.711 --> 00:03:36.340
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this grief,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland has had an amazing 25 years.</v>

57
00:03:36.341 --> 00:03:37.174
<v Speaker 1>This country has gone from having </v>
<v Speaker 1>average salaries are between 10 to </v>

58
00:03:39.161 --> 00:03:43.600
<v Speaker 1>15,000 American dollars per month to </v>
<v Speaker 1>having a panic capita income taking into</v>

59
00:03:43.601 --> 00:03:45.340
<v Speaker 1>accounts each country's price </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

60
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 1>This in 2018 will be higher than that of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>

61
00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>Portugal and every Latin American </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

62
00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.930
<v Speaker 1>and the reality is it's not really that </v>
<v Speaker 1>far behind Spain or Italy either.</v>

63
00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:59.183
<v Speaker 1>Then goes into this point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think there's a question that we </v>

64
00:04:00.241 --> 00:04:02.760
<v Speaker 1>really need to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How did they achieve this?</v>

65
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up because that's what we're </v>

66
00:04:04.771 --> 00:04:09.771
<v Speaker 1>going to talk about in today's video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The end of an era,</v>

67
00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:18.983
<v Speaker 1>34 years from 1945 to 1989,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the socialist state of the People's </v>

68
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:24.803
<v Speaker 1>Republic of Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the satellite country at the Soviet </v>

69
00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.603
<v Speaker 1>Union was in power by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to give you an idea of how great </v>

70
00:04:28.411 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Moscow's control was,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it said that when in 1950,</v>

71
00:04:31.171 --> 00:04:32.004
<v Speaker 1>the Polish leader Bolus Law Barrett show</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joseph Stalin himself a draft of the </v>

72
00:04:35.371 --> 00:04:38.670
<v Speaker 1>future Polish constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the leader of the Soviet Union made</v>

73
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.533
<v Speaker 1>dozens of corrections by hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course were taken into account </v>

74
00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:44.033
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Polish regime was one of the least </v>

75
00:04:45.841 --> 00:04:48.060
<v Speaker 1>harsh in the entire Soviet orbit.</v>

76
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.860
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the lands wasn't collectivize.</v>

77
00:04:51.861 --> 00:04:55.070
<v Speaker 1>The Catholic Church was allowed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>function with relative freedom cans.</v>

78
00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.350
<v Speaker 1>Even though political repression was </v>
<v Speaker 1>high,</v>

79
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.510
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't quite as intense as it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>another country.</v>

80
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.510
<v Speaker 1>Even though of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as in any good socialist country,</v>

81
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:09.620
<v Speaker 1>the state controlled almost everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in 1989,</v>

82
00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:12.920
<v Speaker 1>it's economy completely shattered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

83
00:05:12.921 --> 00:05:16.280
<v Speaker 1>thanks to all these small freedoms or </v>
<v Speaker 1>real political opposition emerge,</v>

84
00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.020
<v Speaker 1>lead among others by lack of Valenzuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the Independent Solidarity</v>

85
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thirst for union of all eastern </v>

86
00:05:23.451 --> 00:05:27.420
<v Speaker 1>European country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to this.</v>

87
00:05:27.421 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>When the Soviet Union's power began to </v>
<v Speaker 1>crumble,</v>

88
00:05:29.671 --> 00:05:30.504
<v Speaker 1>Poland's became the first country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>eastern Europe to set its political </v>

89
00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:36.990
<v Speaker 1>transition in motion to completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandon communism and so on.</v>

90
00:05:36.991 --> 00:05:37.741
<v Speaker 1>June the fourth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

91
00:05:37.741 --> 00:05:39.960
<v Speaker 1>89,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first relatively free elections were</v>

92
00:05:39.961 --> 00:05:42.000
<v Speaker 1>held,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and with that it was no turning back</v>

93
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.810
<v Speaker 2>shock therapy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just a few months</v>

94
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:57.460
<v Speaker 1>after the first elections in September </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 19 nine,</v>

95
00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.313
<v Speaker 1>the minister of Finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less egg bow Sarah of it sets a plan on </v>

96
00:06:00.771 --> 00:06:01.604
<v Speaker 1>the table to shred the entire communist </v>
<v Speaker 1>fabric and to replace it with a </v>

97
00:06:04.821 --> 00:06:06.710
<v Speaker 1>capitalist model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three months later,</v>

98
00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:09.680
<v Speaker 1>this shock therapy as it's been known as</v>
<v Speaker 1>launched,</v>

99
00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.150
<v Speaker 3>exerted a liberal program called shock </v>
<v Speaker 3>therapy.</v>

100
00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:17.140
<v Speaker 3>The idea was either the patient improves</v>
<v Speaker 3>or dies from one day to the next.</v>

101
00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:18.003
<v Speaker 3>Everything was liberalized in a very </v>
<v Speaker 3>rigid and centralized economy in which </v>

102
00:06:21.401 --> 00:06:24.730
<v Speaker 3>prices and needs had nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 3>reality.</v>

103
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:28.610
<v Speaker 3>He called it the lunar economy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Everything was fiction or pvh.</v>

104
00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.850
<v Speaker 3>Nia Oshinsky,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Polish diplomat.</v>

105
00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.410
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly everything changed.</v>

106
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:33.310
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

107
00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:39.170
<v Speaker 1>Prices were liberalized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Controls were lifted,</v>

108
00:06:39.171 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 1>people were able to set up private </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses.</v>

109
00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.373
<v Speaker 1>They stopped printing money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy began to open up to the </v>

110
00:06:44.031 --> 00:06:44.864
<v Speaker 1>world and the plan was launched to </v>
<v Speaker 1>privatized public enterprises within a </v>

111
00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:52.974
<v Speaker 1>short time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even the polls could recognize </v>

112
00:06:54.811 --> 00:06:55.760
<v Speaker 1>Poland's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

113
00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:58.830
<v Speaker 1>the government's had a very clear idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>about the future.</v>

114
00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:59.723
<v Speaker 1>Ponant needed to get as far away from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia as possible and strengthen its </v>

115
00:07:02.821 --> 00:07:05.460
<v Speaker 1>ties with the rest of Europe and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

116
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:06.930
<v Speaker 1>So what was the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:07:06.931 --> 00:07:10.380
<v Speaker 1>a few years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they joined the European Union and NATO.</v>

118
00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.273
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what model do you think the country has </v>

119
00:07:12.451 --> 00:07:13.284
<v Speaker 1>followed since</v>

120
00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:24.810
<v Speaker 3>change?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

121
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.970
<v Speaker 1>I've already told you plenty of times </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world is getting better.</v>

122
00:07:30.020 --> 00:07:32.990
<v Speaker 1>Poverty is decreasing and countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting rich yet,</v>

123
00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:33.853
<v Speaker 1>but despite this belonging to the club </v>
<v Speaker 1>of rich countries is still a difficult </v>

124
00:07:37.551 --> 00:07:38.630
<v Speaker 1>mission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even so,</v>

125
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:43.070
<v Speaker 1>everything points to Poland achieving </v>
<v Speaker 1>this within a very short amount of time.</v>

126
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:44.043
<v Speaker 1>Dev,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country is becoming eastern </v>

127
00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.720
<v Speaker 1>Europe's Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

128
00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>Poland has become an industrial power </v>
<v Speaker 1>house,</v>

129
00:07:58.821 --> 00:08:01.310
<v Speaker 1>flooded with multinationals and like in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

130
00:08:01.311 --> 00:08:02.144
<v Speaker 1>it's smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Medium sized companies have begun to </v>

131
00:08:03.561 --> 00:08:06.050
<v Speaker 1>cross the border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The results I'll since 1999,</v>

132
00:08:06.051 --> 00:08:06.884
<v Speaker 1>it's foreign trade has multiplied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 25 Polish exports amount to </v>

133
00:08:10.971 --> 00:08:15.971
<v Speaker 1>almost $200,000,000,000 per year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which represents more than 40 percent of</v>

134
00:08:16.191 --> 00:08:18.960
<v Speaker 1>the country's GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a seriously high.</v>

135
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>Simply explains why Polish roads off </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of trucks.</v>

136
00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Now you must be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

137
00:08:36.951 --> 00:08:37.784
<v Speaker 1>how are they achieving all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What on earth is the key to their </v>

138
00:08:39.911 --> 00:08:41.030
<v Speaker 1>success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

139
00:08:41.070 --> 00:08:41.903
<v Speaker 1>Dave,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are taking notes at the Polish </v>

140
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:43.784
<v Speaker 1>recipe has four main ingredient to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>establishment of institutions that </v>

141
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:53.590
<v Speaker 1>attract a lot of foreign investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

142
00:08:53.610 --> 00:08:55.080
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>property rights,</v>

143
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.420
<v Speaker 1>ease of setting up companies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition.</v>

144
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.283
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>14 special economic zones have been </v>

145
00:08:59.911 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 1>created where any interested company can</v>
<v Speaker 1>gain many advantages.</v>

146
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strict controls of public accounts.</v>

147
00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:10.830
<v Speaker 1>Homelands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government is one of the most healthy in</v>

148
00:09:10.831 --> 00:09:12.360
<v Speaker 1>the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public debt,</v>

149
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.223
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is barely 50 percent of the GDP and </v>

150
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:16.323
<v Speaker 1>almost as importantly since 1989,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have been set on fighting </v>

151
00:09:19.051 --> 00:09:19.884
<v Speaker 1>inflation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so no printing bills to finance the </v>

152
00:09:21.511 --> 00:09:24.150
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically the opposite of countries like</v>

153
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:25.013
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

154
00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.630
<v Speaker 1>first quality education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

155
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:30.493
<v Speaker 1>You heard that rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland has managed to make their </v>

156
00:09:31.861 --> 00:09:32.694
<v Speaker 1>educational system work and they've done</v>
<v Speaker 1>this without wasting huge amounts of </v>

157
00:09:36.561 --> 00:09:37.394
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's rate of university students is </v>

158
00:09:38.661 --> 00:09:40.760
<v Speaker 1>higher than the average of the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union.</v>

159
00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:44.540
<v Speaker 1>Nine out of 10 young people complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>secondary education,</v>

160
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:45.403
<v Speaker 1>and according to international studies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Polish education system is one of </v>

161
00:09:48.111 --> 00:09:50.210
<v Speaker 1>the 10 best,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not just in Europe,</v>

162
00:09:50.211 --> 00:09:55.211
<v Speaker 1>but in the whole world and forth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's moderate taxes.</v>

163
00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.233
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies are taxed 19 percent while </v>

164
00:09:59.011 --> 00:09:59.844
<v Speaker 1>smaller companies are taxed 15 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>income tax breaks down into two </v>

165
00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:03.804
<v Speaker 1>brackets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>18 percent for the first 24,032 percent </v>

166
00:10:06.780 --> 00:10:11.780
<v Speaker 1>for the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in addition,</v>

167
00:10:15.061 --> 00:10:17.460
<v Speaker 1>because Poland is a fairly conservative </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

168
00:10:17.490 --> 00:10:21.900
<v Speaker 1>families have even more advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if we take into account both personal</v>

169
00:10:21.901 --> 00:10:24.850
<v Speaker 1>taxes and pension payments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland is the fourth one,</v>

170
00:10:24.851 --> 00:10:28.650
<v Speaker 1>cd country where families pay less </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct taxes,</v>

171
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:34.983
<v Speaker 4>right?</v>

172
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.033
<v Speaker 1>So it's with these four ingredients that</v>
<v Speaker 1>Poland has managed to become eastern </v>

173
00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:40.363
<v Speaker 1>Europe's Gemini and exports and </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial power with a healthy </v>

174
00:10:42.941 --> 00:10:45.880
<v Speaker 1>governments can take quality of life </v>
<v Speaker 1>that just keeps on growing.</v>

175
00:10:45.940 --> 00:10:46.773
<v Speaker 1>The best proof of this is perhaps that </v>
<v Speaker 1>within a few years the great power of </v>

176
00:10:49.511 --> 00:10:50.344
<v Speaker 1>the east has gone from being a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>of immigrants to the country of </v>

177
00:10:53.321 --> 00:10:58.321
<v Speaker 1>immigrants from a country of immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a country of immigrants.</v>

178
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.353
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if something has characterized the </v>

179
00:11:08.771 --> 00:11:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Polish economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the simple availability of work.</v>

180
00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment is approaching six percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and many companies are beginning to have</v>

181
00:11:15.911 --> 00:11:18.760
<v Speaker 1>a problem finding workers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Initially,</v>

182
00:11:18.910 --> 00:11:19.743
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies would only look for </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly experienced employees with </v>

183
00:11:23.111 --> 00:11:23.944
<v Speaker 1>titles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they take everyone and give them a </v>

184
00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:26.673
<v Speaker 1>month training if necessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roman and Lake entrepreneur and of </v>

185
00:11:29.501 --> 00:11:32.560
<v Speaker 1>course if companies need a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>workers and can't find them,</v>

186
00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:33.483
<v Speaker 1>I'll wages go up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average gross salary in the first </v>

187
00:11:35.981 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 1>quarter of 2018 was seven point one </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent higher than in the same period.</v>

188
00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:41.073
<v Speaker 1>In 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Average gross salary exceeds $1,400 per </v>

189
00:11:44.261 --> 00:11:46.450
<v Speaker 1>month with central statistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>office of Poland.</v>

190
00:11:46.660 --> 00:11:48.370
<v Speaker 1>And you know what this situation has led</v>
<v Speaker 1>to,</v>

191
00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:49.031
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>first,</v>

192
00:11:49.031 --> 00:11:49.864
<v Speaker 1>many young poles who until recently left</v>
<v Speaker 1>on master Richie European Union </v>

193
00:11:52.691 --> 00:11:54.880
<v Speaker 1>countries deciding to stay.</v>

194
00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:59.140
<v Speaker 1>I'm second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

195
00:11:59.141 --> 00:12:02.020
<v Speaker 1>more than 2 million Ukrainians have </v>
<v Speaker 1>settled in Poland,</v>

196
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.883
<v Speaker 1>especially young people looking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>better opportunities than the ones they </v>

197
00:12:05.231 --> 00:12:06.064
<v Speaker 1>could find in their country of origin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means the Poland now has more </v>

198
00:12:09.281 --> 00:12:11.170
<v Speaker 1>people arriving than leaving.</v>

199
00:12:15.930 --> 00:12:17.370
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we always say,</v>

200
00:12:17.400 --> 00:12:20.190
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything is so great.</v>

201
00:12:20.220 --> 00:12:22.740
<v Speaker 1>Portland is facing quite a serious aging</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

202
00:12:22.741 --> 00:12:26.760
<v Speaker 1>Ends the Lore Justice Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very nationalist and very conservative</v>

203
00:12:26.761 --> 00:12:27.594
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won every recent election and now </v>

204
00:12:29.401 --> 00:12:31.290
<v Speaker 1>controls the country some of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions.</v>

205
00:12:31.291 --> 00:12:32.124
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union threatened Poland's </v>

206
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:36.740
<v Speaker 1>with sanctions and even suspends their </v>
<v Speaker 1>rights as a member,</v>

207
00:12:36.770 --> 00:12:39.960
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>address in a future video now.</v>

208
00:12:39.961 --> 00:12:40.794
<v Speaker 1>It's your time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think ponens would be a good </v>

209
00:12:42.361 --> 00:12:46.680
<v Speaker 1>example for Cuba or with the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>model actually be better?</v>
