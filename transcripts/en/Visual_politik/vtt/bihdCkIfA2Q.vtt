1
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.670
<v Speaker 1>It's the world's largest population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second largest economy.</v>

2
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.720
<v Speaker 1>It has one of the largest multicurrency </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves,</v>

3
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:18.900
<v Speaker 1>the second largest military budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number one trade power globally,</v>

4
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.810
<v Speaker 1>but it's better known as the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory.</v>

5
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.680
<v Speaker 1>These are just a few of the reasons that</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has become a superpower.</v>

6
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:26.573
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're a regular viewer of visual </v>

7
00:00:27.481 --> 00:00:28.314
<v Speaker 1>politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll know that we've done several </v>

8
00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:32.340
<v Speaker 1>videos on this country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've discussed it's foreign policy,</v>

9
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>it's debt issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've discussed how it's companies have </v>

10
00:00:35.041 --> 00:00:38.160
<v Speaker 1>grown all around the world as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>its political system.</v>

11
00:00:38.161 --> 00:00:41.010
<v Speaker 1>We've discussed the Macau or Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suffice to say,</v>

12
00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.250
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot about</v>

13
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.400
<v Speaker 2>no</v>

14
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.900
<v Speaker 1>and we have done so because we believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nowadays it is impossible,</v>

15
00:00:51.901 --> 00:00:52.734
<v Speaker 1>but as well as pretty inconvenient to </v>
<v Speaker 1>discuss international politics without </v>

16
00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:59.150
<v Speaker 1>keeping in mind this huge global player </v>
<v Speaker 1>are there.</v>

17
00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.993
<v Speaker 1>In all of those previous videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could say that we've skipped a </v>

18
00:01:01.681 --> 00:01:04.710
<v Speaker 1>really important question and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>question is really,</v>

19
00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.260
<v Speaker 1>how powerful is China today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:08.094
<v Speaker 1>the good news is that's exactly the </v>
<v Speaker 1>question we're going to be answering in </v>

21
00:01:10.141 --> 00:01:13.290
<v Speaker 1>this video and we're going to do it from</v>
<v Speaker 1>three different perspectives,</v>

22
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.270
<v Speaker 1>military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic and political,</v>

23
00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 1>and look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though many people's date,</v>

24
00:01:16.991 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>think of China as the second most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important global power.</v>

25
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.710
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone agrees with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

26
00:01:22.711 --> 00:01:23.544
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some experts believe that when China </v>

27
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>potential is carefully examined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not actually all that powerful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then again,</v>

29
00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.350
<v Speaker 1>there are plenty of other experts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You stated that Chinese power is growing</v>

30
00:01:34.351 --> 00:01:35.184
<v Speaker 1>at an incredibly fast rate and that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>21st century is most certainly going to </v>

31
00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.260
<v Speaker 1>be China's century.</v>

32
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.340
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we get started,</v>

33
00:01:41.341 --> 00:01:45.690
<v Speaker 1>we should establish one thing first and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what exactly do we mean by power?</v>

34
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.553
<v Speaker 1>Is it to have a lot of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and what about a big army or </v>

35
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.540
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's actually to do with natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources?</v>

36
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:52.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social scientists consider political </v>

37
00:01:53.581 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 1>power to be found in leverage and </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

38
00:01:56.731 --> 00:01:57.564
<v Speaker 1>That is essentially saying the power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to shape and condition the </v>

39
00:02:01.291 --> 00:02:05.070
<v Speaker 1>events and actions of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question now becomes,</v>

40
00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.933
<v Speaker 1>what is China's power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do they have in order to leverage </v>

41
00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:10.980
<v Speaker 1>and influence other countries?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.930
<v Speaker 1>as I said a moment ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this video,</v>

43
00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:13.764
<v Speaker 1>we're going to examine the three main </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas that most often deliver that </v>

44
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.900
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's weapons,</v>

45
00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.810
<v Speaker 1>economics and politics bands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

46
00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:26.811
<v Speaker 1>how about we kick things off with war </v>
<v Speaker 1>dragons strength?</v>

47
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't exactly easy to quantify </v>

48
00:02:34.881 --> 00:02:38.430
<v Speaker 1>anything military strength of a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It depends on several different factors.</v>

49
00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.890
<v Speaker 1>You have to consider how well protected </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country is.</v>

50
00:02:40.891 --> 00:02:44.220
<v Speaker 1>If its soldiers are well trained on how </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern it's arsenal is,</v>

51
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.140
<v Speaker 1>as well as a whole bunch of other </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>

52
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.240
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite these different factors,</v>

53
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:49.074
<v Speaker 1>we can still say the spending on defense</v>
<v Speaker 1>is usually the best way to measure the </v>

54
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.323
<v Speaker 1>military potential of a nation further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we analyze the money a country </v>

55
00:02:57.391 --> 00:02:58.224
<v Speaker 1>spends on its army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also get some other relevant </v>

56
00:02:59.981 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>information like how important is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong military?</v>

57
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.950
<v Speaker 1>It's the governments.</v>

58
00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.330
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

59
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>According to the official figures in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>

60
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:13.960
<v Speaker 1>China spent around $146,000,000,000 on </v>
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>

61
00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.823
<v Speaker 1>but as you can probably imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's government is not a shiny </v>

62
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:19.170
<v Speaker 1>example of transparency in some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources.</v>

63
00:03:19.171 --> 00:03:24.171
<v Speaker 1>Indicate is that the number could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to 226 billion anyway,</v>

64
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.123
<v Speaker 1>whichever number is correct.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We do know that China has multiplied </v>

65
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.583
<v Speaker 1>it's defense spending by five in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last decade and it is today the second </v>

66
00:03:32.591 --> 00:03:35.800
<v Speaker 1>largest spending country in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to defense spending,</v>

67
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.440
<v Speaker 1>trailing only behind the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

68
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.370
<v Speaker 1>five times though it's a significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase in such a short period of time.</v>

69
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:46.353
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this hasn't been disproportionately </v>

70
00:03:47.501 --> 00:03:51.760
<v Speaker 1>compared to the country's GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed spending has been closely related</v>

71
00:03:51.761 --> 00:03:52.594
<v Speaker 1>to the economic growth of the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>having been kept within two percent of </v>

72
00:03:55.631 --> 00:03:58.780
<v Speaker 1>the overall GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is not the end of it.</v>

73
00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:59.673
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the public budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see how defense expenses have </v>

74
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.214
<v Speaker 1>dropped from 12 percent of the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending in 2001 to a listen more than </v>

75
00:04:07.031 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>six percent in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And can you guess what that means?</v>

76
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means that China has made less of an </v>

77
00:04:13.601 --> 00:04:15.820
<v Speaker 1>effort when it comes to spending than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the US.</v>

78
00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.270
<v Speaker 1>When you consider GDP and public </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending as reference points.</v>

79
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:22.030
<v Speaker 1>So take a look at this chart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

80
00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.890
<v Speaker 1>we already know two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

81
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese military spending will keep </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing at the same level of the economy</v>

82
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:35.084
<v Speaker 1>does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which will gradually shrink that </v>

83
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 1>difference with the US seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know that military spending is only a</v>

84
00:04:39.801 --> 00:04:40.634
<v Speaker 1>small bird into the Chinese economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say it is a sustainable </v>

85
00:04:43.491 --> 00:04:44.324
<v Speaker 1>amounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if the government needed to reduce </v>

86
00:04:45.351 --> 00:04:46.184
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the governments could manage to do so </v>

87
00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.040
<v Speaker 1>without too many problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

88
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.933
<v Speaker 1>it's now important that we talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>military capability because when it </v>

89
00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:55.540
<v Speaker 1>comes to Chinese military power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rob,</v>

90
00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:56.473
<v Speaker 1>certain limitations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dragon lacks dryness potential to </v>

91
00:05:04.301 --> 00:05:05.134
<v Speaker 1>you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Operate military force outside of their </v>

92
00:05:05.921 --> 00:05:09.490
<v Speaker 1>borders is actually pretty low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike the United States,</v>

93
00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.500
<v Speaker 1>China does not have any military bases </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>

94
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.980
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of Djibouti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we will see you later on.</v>

95
00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.873
<v Speaker 1>It also doesn't have that many allies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a verb already logistic network or </v>

96
00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:20.013
<v Speaker 1>satellites for launch deployments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That actually doesn't have much at all </v>

97
00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:25.150
<v Speaker 1>and then you must consider that there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are also pretty inexperienced.</v>

98
00:05:25.151 --> 00:05:28.630
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's been 40 years since the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>time Chinese troops engaged in.</v>

99
00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.830
<v Speaker 2>That's what</v>

100
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:34.800
<v Speaker 1>does that mean that China is some sort </v>
<v Speaker 1>of paper tiger?</v>

101
00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:35.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

102
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.773
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New resources are allowing Beijing to </v>

103
00:05:38.611 --> 00:05:39.444
<v Speaker 1>make important changes and investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's growing military potential has </v>

104
00:05:43.681 --> 00:05:44.514
<v Speaker 1>changed the balance of forces in Asia </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the People's Liberation Army is now </v>

105
00:05:47.521 --> 00:05:50.340
<v Speaker 1>capable of conducting operations on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>global scale.</v>

106
00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:51.323
<v Speaker 1>China is making changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have reduced their military by </v>

107
00:05:53.701 --> 00:05:54.534
<v Speaker 1>300,000 soldiers since 2015 and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on the military upgrades and </v>

108
00:05:58.521 --> 00:05:59.354
<v Speaker 1>their ability to operate abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese army opened its first for a </v>

109
00:06:01.951 --> 00:06:05.990
<v Speaker 1>military base in July of 2017 in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>African country of Djibouti.</v>

110
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.853
<v Speaker 1>Then in 2012 trying to bolt it's first </v>
<v Speaker 1>aircraft carrier from Ukraine and in </v>

111
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:14.900
<v Speaker 1>2017 they completed their first to </v>
<v Speaker 1>domestic carry up with more to follow is</v>

112
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:19.901
<v Speaker 1>also investing in missiles and it's air </v>
<v Speaker 1>force has put into service.</v>

113
00:06:20.481 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 1>It's new generation 20 stealth fighter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

114
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:24.374
<v Speaker 1>it is going to take decades at a minimum</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the Chinese army to come clips to </v>

115
00:06:27.951 --> 00:06:28.784
<v Speaker 1>the American army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is certainly no other country </v>

116
00:06:30.831 --> 00:06:33.470
<v Speaker 1>out that with as much potential as </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

117
00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:36.260
<v Speaker 1>we all better get used to having to deal</v>
<v Speaker 1>with China.</v>

118
00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:38.870
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about global military </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy,</v>

119
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:47.460
<v Speaker 1>the economic power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is no way to sustain any political</v>

120
00:06:48.201 --> 00:06:50.630
<v Speaker 1>or military power without economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>capacity,</v>

121
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:51.493
<v Speaker 1>but there's more to it than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economic power has its own great </v>

122
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:55.243
<v Speaker 1>potential to influence other governments</v>
<v Speaker 1>and large companies and this is what is </v>

123
00:06:58.461 --> 00:06:59.330
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

124
00:06:59.331 --> 00:07:03.290
<v Speaker 1>with direct foreign investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is both entering and leaving China</v>

125
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>as a pure financial figure amount.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not actually very hydrus yes,</v>

126
00:07:06.651 --> 00:07:10.280
<v Speaker 1>but year after year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this figure has grown and grown.</v>

127
00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.173
<v Speaker 1>In a previous visual politic video we </v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at is how in the last few years </v>

128
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:18.760
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies have started to invest</v>
<v Speaker 1>money around the world in 2016,</v>

129
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.043
<v Speaker 1>excluding Hong Kong and Macau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This amount was more than $180 million </v>

130
00:07:27.741 --> 00:07:28.790
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to this.</v>

131
00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:29.653
<v Speaker 1>China is gaining influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in developing countries that </v>

132
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:33.990
<v Speaker 1>have seen quite the opportunity in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>

133
00:07:33.991 --> 00:07:34.060
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

134
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:39.060
<v Speaker 2>money and just</v>

135
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:42.003
<v Speaker 1>the same sort of thing with trades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he had trying to raise by far the </v>

136
00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.580
<v Speaker 1>leading global power and we're not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about Chinese exports here.</v>

137
00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:49.414
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about imports a lot to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention here because Chinese economic </v>

138
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:55.340
<v Speaker 1>growth has created a more prosperous </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class everyday.</v>

139
00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:56.253
<v Speaker 1>More than a hundred and 80,000 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave poverty behind and become a part </v>

140
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:01.413
<v Speaker 1>of the middle class that has enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>money to well spent and it's this view </v>

141
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.930
<v Speaker 1>is something that has caused many </v>
<v Speaker 1>multinationals to make China.</v>

142
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.793
<v Speaker 1>Then number one priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is certainly the case of BMW where </v>

143
00:08:13.031 --> 00:08:17.410
<v Speaker 1>one out of every four cars sold by this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company is sold in China.</v>

144
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:18.423
<v Speaker 1>A country where sales and about 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent larger than in the United </v>

145
00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:22.533
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still more Asian assembly </v>

146
00:08:23.741 --> 00:08:26.050
<v Speaker 1>lines occupying several countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

147
00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:26.913
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they produce one components while the </v>

148
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:32.650
<v Speaker 1>another is made in South Korea and later</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are all assembled in China.</v>

149
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.613
<v Speaker 1>Vi welds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>great production center in the Asia </v>

150
00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:40.240
<v Speaker 1>Pacific region to hundreds of thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of jobs depend on trade with China,</v>

151
00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:45.820
<v Speaker 1>but not everything looks so good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are problems too,</v>

152
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:50.590
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>design and innovation because well,</v>

153
00:08:50.591 --> 00:08:54.490
<v Speaker 1>truth be told,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation and creativity usually get on</v>

154
00:08:54.491 --> 00:08:55.324
<v Speaker 1>with dictatorships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but still things are changing and </v>

155
00:08:57.871 --> 00:08:58.704
<v Speaker 1>investment trade and multinationals are </v>
<v Speaker 1>all things that generate a lot of </v>

156
00:09:01.770 --> 00:09:02.670
<v Speaker 1>influence in</v>

157
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.860
<v Speaker 1>growing political power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is political power.</v>

158
00:09:17.660 --> 00:09:20.330
<v Speaker 1>It's often said that China lacks </v>
<v Speaker 1>leadership and further,</v>

159
00:09:20.350 --> 00:09:23.420
<v Speaker 1>that's like the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which counseling solid allies all around</v>

160
00:09:23.421 --> 00:09:26.480
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is some sort of lone wolf.</v>

161
00:09:26.510 --> 00:09:27.650
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has been said for years,</v>

162
00:09:27.651 --> 00:09:31.220
<v Speaker 1>but do keep in mind that this is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to change.</v>

163
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:32.113
<v Speaker 1>China has bet on increasing their </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence on global politics and is </v>

164
00:09:35.091 --> 00:09:38.360
<v Speaker 1>doing that to defend interests that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly global.</v>

165
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:41.833
<v Speaker 1>Plan a strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese are using that large </v>

166
00:09:43.761 --> 00:09:46.400
<v Speaker 1>currency reserves to expand their </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>

167
00:09:46.430 --> 00:09:47.263
<v Speaker 1>In the last decade alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing has loaned money to several </v>

168
00:09:49.641 --> 00:09:53.930
<v Speaker 1>governments and has invested all over </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world from Fiji to Madagascar,</v>

169
00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:54.853
<v Speaker 1>and that is not the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've also set up ambitious plans to </v>

170
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:00.350
<v Speaker 1>achieve their goals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>

171
00:10:00.351 --> 00:10:02.600
<v Speaker 1>the Asian infrastructure investment </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank,</v>

172
00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:03.434
<v Speaker 1>a financial power controlled by China in</v>
<v Speaker 1>based in Beijing will reduce the </v>

173
00:10:06.411 --> 00:10:08.840
<v Speaker 1>influence of institutions like the World</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank,</v>

174
00:10:08.841 --> 00:10:09.674
<v Speaker 1>the IMF or the Asian Development Bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of them controlled by Washington to </v>

175
00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:15.950
<v Speaker 1>some extent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how about some more examples?</v>

176
00:10:15.951 --> 00:10:17.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the new silk roads,</v>

177
00:10:17.361 --> 00:10:18.680
<v Speaker 1>the one road,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one belt,</v>

178
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.990
<v Speaker 1>the largest infrastructure project in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

179
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.270
<v Speaker 1>Then there is the China Investment </v>
<v Speaker 1>Corporation,</v>

180
00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.163
<v Speaker 1>a sovereign funds that managers more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than $800,000,000,000 and invests in </v>

181
00:10:28.041 --> 00:10:30.380
<v Speaker 1>companies all around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

182
00:10:30.381 --> 00:10:33.440
<v Speaker 1>we didn't make a mistake there.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is billion with a b.</v>

183
00:10:33.470 --> 00:10:34.303
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's China actually had any political </v>

184
00:10:37.311 --> 00:10:39.350
<v Speaker 1>success with this strategy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

185
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:40.213
<v Speaker 1>the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have and that is well demonstrated </v>

186
00:10:42.800 --> 00:10:47.270
<v Speaker 1>in the country of Greece.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is developing enormous projects in</v>

187
00:10:47.271 --> 00:10:49.040
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the portal,</v>

188
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.310
<v Speaker 1>the Hellinikon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sort of Monaco in the heart,</v>

189
00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:52.153
<v Speaker 2>the baffin.</v>

190
00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:59.430
<v Speaker 1>What's the result of all this wild?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last June,</v>

191
00:10:59.431 --> 00:11:00.264
<v Speaker 1>Athens vetoed a resolution that condemns</v>
<v Speaker 1>the violation of rights in China and </v>

192
00:11:04.311 --> 00:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>it's not for the first time anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is still facing real challenges.</v>

193
00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:10.680
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the biggest of these is it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging population.</v>

194
00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:12.180
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have a look at this.</v>

195
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:17.410
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite</v>

196
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:19.840
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the influence of China and international</v>

197
00:11:19.841 --> 00:11:20.674
<v Speaker 1>politics will grow quite a lot in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next few years and China is already a </v>

198
00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:26.950
<v Speaker 1>new superpower as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's our opinion at visual politic and</v>

199
00:11:26.951 --> 00:11:27.784
<v Speaker 1>now we'd love to know yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think China is a superpower or </v>

200
00:11:30.101 --> 00:11:30.934
<v Speaker 1>just a flash in the pan and do you think</v>
<v Speaker 1>China should be included in the </v>

201
00:11:33.671 --> 00:11:35.710
<v Speaker 1>international community to a greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent?</v>

202
00:11:35.830 --> 00:11:36.640
