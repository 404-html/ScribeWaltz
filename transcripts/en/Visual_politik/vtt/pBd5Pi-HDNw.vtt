<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.370
<v Speaker 2>almost 50 years ago in 1969 then </v>
<v Speaker 2>president Richard Nixon announced the so</v>

3
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:13.204
<v Speaker 2>called war on drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a hard line strategy that aims to </v>

4
00:00:16.241 --> 00:00:17.074
<v Speaker 2>pursue and punish the production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution and consumption of </v>

5
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:22.300
<v Speaker 2>substances that were considered </v>
<v Speaker 2>prohibited drugs.</v>

6
00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.960
<v Speaker 2>America's public enemy number one in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United States is drug abuse.</v>

7
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.493
<v Speaker 2>Since then is if you,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even though Washington has used all his </v>

8
00:00:31.031 --> 00:00:31.864
<v Speaker 2>mind to this hotline strategy as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>result of is in a resounding failure </v>

9
00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.240
<v Speaker 2>both at home and abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

10
00:00:37.241 --> 00:00:38.074
<v Speaker 2>each year the u s government spends tens</v>
<v Speaker 2>of billions of dollars in this </v>

11
00:00:40.841 --> 00:00:41.674
<v Speaker 2>particular war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>achieving practically nothing more than </v>

12
00:00:43.601 --> 00:00:44.434
<v Speaker 2>imprisoning hundreds of thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 2>people and fueling a culture of </v>

13
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:48.304
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The war on drugs has been going on for </v>

14
00:00:50.501 --> 00:00:52.750
<v Speaker 2>60 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and if a business,</v>

15
00:00:52.751 --> 00:00:54.880
<v Speaker 2>if I'd had a business that had failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>for 60 years,</v>

16
00:00:54.881 --> 00:00:56.860
<v Speaker 2>I would have closed it down 59 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>ago.</v>

17
00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.290
<v Speaker 2>The federal government's figures on </v>
<v Speaker 2>arrests for violence.</v>

18
00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>NC drug laws are absolutely</v>

19
00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.133
<v Speaker 1>schilling</v>

20
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 2>for the shoulder.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every year the United States authorities</v>

21
00:01:14.161 --> 00:01:17.940
<v Speaker 2>rest more than 1 million people for </v>
<v Speaker 2>breaking anti drug laws.</v>

22
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.460
<v Speaker 2>That is to say in 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>

23
00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.303
<v Speaker 2>the rest as many people as the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>population of Greece or Cuba for drug </v>

24
00:01:24.721 --> 00:01:27.050
<v Speaker 2>related crimes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is well,</v>

25
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.480
<v Speaker 2>a lot of</v>

26
00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:30.220
<v Speaker 1>people since</v>

27
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.053
<v Speaker 2>1989 ans listen carefully because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is rather impressive in the United </v>

28
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.363
<v Speaker 2>States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more people have been imprisoned for </v>

29
00:01:37.361 --> 00:01:42.160
<v Speaker 2>this type of crime than for all other </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent crimes combined.</v>

30
00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.630
<v Speaker 2>Our most serious problem today is </v>
<v Speaker 2>cocaine and in particular crap.</v>

31
00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.060
<v Speaker 2>Who's responsible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let me pet you straight out.</v>

32
00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.193
<v Speaker 2>Everyone who uses drugs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everyone who sells drugs and everyone </v>

33
00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:55.960
<v Speaker 2>who looks the other way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

34
00:01:55.961 --> 00:01:56.794
<v Speaker 2>this is precisely what has led the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country to have the highest </v>

35
00:01:59.111 --> 00:01:59.944
<v Speaker 2>incarceration rate in the wells four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five times higher than other countries </v>

36
00:02:02.621 --> 00:02:06.820
<v Speaker 2>like France or Germany and even higher </v>
<v Speaker 2>than totalitarian countries like China.</v>

37
00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.850
<v Speaker 2>It's all pretty damn crazy as of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>

38
00:02:14.291 --> 00:02:17.850
<v Speaker 2>US jails aren't exactly the best place </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the world to rehabilitate.</v>

39
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:18.703
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the American experience seems to say </v>

40
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.770
<v Speaker 2>quite the opposite,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but all right,</v>

41
00:02:23.771 --> 00:02:24.610
<v Speaker 2>you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay,</v>

42
00:02:24.611 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 2>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it might be a tough strategy,</v>

43
00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.600
<v Speaker 2>but maybe it's fulfilling its purpose,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

44
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that no,</v>

45
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.390
<v Speaker 2>it isn't beyond crowding prison spending</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of billions and condemning many</v>

46
00:02:34.391 --> 00:02:35.224
<v Speaker 2>young people do have difficulties of </v>
<v Speaker 2>reentering the world with a criminal </v>

47
00:02:37.301 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 2>record.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This war on drugs as achieved very,</v>

48
00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.550
<v Speaker 2>very little.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

49
00:02:42.551 --> 00:02:45.550
<v Speaker 2>it's achieved practically nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

50
00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:46.413
<v Speaker 2>despite so many efforts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States still has one of the </v>

51
00:02:49.031 --> 00:02:49.864
<v Speaker 2>highest drug use rates in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This rate is even higher today than it </v>

52
00:02:54.071 --> 00:02:58.870
<v Speaker 2>was in the 1980s we lost more than 175</v>

53
00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.873
<v Speaker 3>to overdoses every day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and millions more are struggling with </v>

54
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:04.670
<v Speaker 3>addiction</v>

55
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.190
<v Speaker 2>and regarding their results outside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

56
00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:08.090
<v Speaker 2>What?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can I say?</v>

57
00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.953
<v Speaker 2>We only need to take a look at Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>America to see how that's gone because </v>

58
00:03:11.781 --> 00:03:12.614
<v Speaker 2>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was one thing this war on drugs </v>

59
00:03:13.461 --> 00:03:16.700
<v Speaker 2>has certainly achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's helping drug traffickers make</v>

60
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:17.930
<v Speaker 2>a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

61
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:18.840
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>

62
00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.273
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.980
<v Speaker 2>Entire pro edition and strong anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>strategy.</v>

64
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.190
<v Speaker 2>I've made the illegal drug trade </v>
<v Speaker 2>extremely lucrative.</v>

65
00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.053
<v Speaker 2>Basically a goldmine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is pouring money into drug </v>

66
00:03:36.551 --> 00:03:38.680
<v Speaker 2>traffickers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>gangs and cartels,</v>

67
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:41.110
<v Speaker 2>while spreading violence throughout </v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin America.</v>

68
00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.973
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

69
00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.680
<v Speaker 3>Cocaine cartel does not begin in Meti </v>
<v Speaker 3>and Columbia.</v>

70
00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:47.900
<v Speaker 3>It begins in the streets of New York,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Miami,</v>

71
00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.770
<v Speaker 3>Los Angeles and every American city were</v>
<v Speaker 3>crack is bought and sold.</v>

72
00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.740
<v Speaker 3>Nancy Reagan</v>

73
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.920
<v Speaker 5>and drug dealers need to know that we </v>
<v Speaker 5>want them out of high schools,</v>

74
00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:57.993
<v Speaker 5>neighborhoods and our lives and the only</v>
<v Speaker 5>way to do that is to take the customers </v>

75
00:04:02.351 --> 00:04:07.351
<v Speaker 5>away from the product,</v>
<v Speaker 5>say no to drugs and say yes to life.</v>

76
00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.553
<v Speaker 2>That holds your horse is just a moment </v>
<v Speaker 2>because often many failures it seems a </v>

77
00:04:11.351 --> 00:04:15.340
<v Speaker 2>new strategy isn't being pursued in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States and so far,</v>

78
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.080
<v Speaker 2>well the results have been quite </v>
<v Speaker 2>promising.</v>

79
00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:20.790
<v Speaker 2>You might have heard about the changes </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the marijuana industry</v>

80
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>with these scissors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I dubbed the Bri</v>

81
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.100
<v Speaker 3>big change</v>

82
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.333
<v Speaker 2>on January the first 2018 California </v>
<v Speaker 2>became the eighth territory in the </v>

83
00:04:42.611 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 2>United States to legalize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>production,</v>

84
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:49.030
<v Speaker 2>distribution and consumption of </v>
<v Speaker 2>marijuana for recreational use.</v>

85
00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.390
<v Speaker 2>It's a medical use was approved way back</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1996</v>

86
00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>wow,</v>

87
00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.173
<v Speaker 2>thanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is this in addition to California and </v>

88
00:04:56.411 --> 00:04:57.550
<v Speaker 2>Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Colorado,</v>

89
00:04:57.551 --> 00:04:58.750
<v Speaker 2>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Massachusetts,</v>

90
00:04:58.751 --> 00:04:59.620
<v Speaker 2>Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington,</v>

91
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:02.170
<v Speaker 2>Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ans the capital of Washington DC.</v>

92
00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:06.190
<v Speaker 2>Marijuana is recreational use is </v>
<v Speaker 2>perfectly legal for its paws.</v>

93
00:05:06.191 --> 00:05:07.024
<v Speaker 2>The state of Vermont has just announced </v>
<v Speaker 2>that starting on July the first </v>

94
00:05:09.821 --> 00:05:12.430
<v Speaker 2>possession and consumption will also be </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal.</v>

95
00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.073
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

96
00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.500
<v Speaker 2>As we're talking about a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important change,</v>

97
00:05:17.501 --> 00:05:18.334
<v Speaker 2>especially if you take into account so </v>
<v Speaker 2>that federal legislation as we'll see </v>

98
00:05:20.981 --> 00:05:21.814
<v Speaker 2>later,</v>
<v Speaker 2>still considers this a prohibited </v>

99
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 2>activity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

100
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 2>last year this new marijuana industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>legally moved almost a $7 billion,</v>

101
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.870
<v Speaker 2>a figure that is expected to rise </v>
<v Speaker 2>strongly in the upcoming years,</v>

102
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:32.733
<v Speaker 2>especially since the California market </v>
<v Speaker 2>alone is estimated to make more than $5 </v>

103
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:37.443
<v Speaker 2>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about an industry that is </v>

104
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:44.104
<v Speaker 2>already generating many jobs and also </v>
<v Speaker 2>paying loads of tax and we're not only </v>

105
00:05:47.741 --> 00:05:49.990
<v Speaker 2>talking about selling marijuana for </v>
<v Speaker 2>direct consumption.</v>

106
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.820
<v Speaker 2>A lot of new businesses are also </v>
<v Speaker 2>emerging,</v>

107
00:05:51.821 --> 00:05:54.100
<v Speaker 2>which take advantage of its ingredients,</v>

108
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.870
<v Speaker 3>candy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>cookies,</v>

109
00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:58.010
<v Speaker 3>sweets.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have hundreds of products.</v>

110
00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:02.240
<v Speaker 2>This business is worth a lot and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state keeps 25% of every dollar we make.</v>

111
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:03.980
<v Speaker 2>Eric Kinney,</v>
<v Speaker 2>owner of Zen,</v>

112
00:06:03.981 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>West Hollywood,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles.</v>

113
00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:08.163
<v Speaker 2>Understand to believe the states that </v>
<v Speaker 2>have legalized this industry have also </v>

114
00:06:10.251 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 2>set special regulations and taxes for </v>
<v Speaker 2>it.</v>

115
00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.963
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

116
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:18.380
<v Speaker 2>Cities and counties have basically done </v>
<v Speaker 2>the same thing,</v>

117
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:19.940
<v Speaker 2>regulation state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how it can be sold,</v>

118
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.550
<v Speaker 2>where it can be sold,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and how much has to be paid for it.</v>

119
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 2>It's like any other heavily regulated </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

120
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 2>Look at the pharmaceutical industry or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the liquor industry.</v>

121
00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:28.663
<v Speaker 2>They're heavily,</v>
<v Speaker 2>heavily regulated industries and the </v>

122
00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>cannabis industry is no different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cara Martinson,</v>

<v Speaker 2>Federal Affairs Manager for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>California State Association of </v>

124
00:06:36.231 --> 00:06:37.064
<v Speaker 2>counties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is not exactly cheap for these </v>

125
00:06:38.781 --> 00:06:40.570
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In some California in cities,</v>

126
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:44.780
<v Speaker 2>the sum of all taxes can amounts to 40% </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these new companies turnover,</v>

127
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.943
<v Speaker 2>which is a lot in Colorado.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first dates there's a legalized the </v>

128
00:06:48.471 --> 00:06:51.080
<v Speaker 2>sale and consumption of marijuana for </v>
<v Speaker 2>recreational use,</v>

129
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:51.914
<v Speaker 2>the industry already invoices about $1 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion every year and to the state's </v>

130
00:06:55.281 --> 00:06:56.114
<v Speaker 2>income in taxes exceed $200 million.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Among the eight states where </v>

131
00:07:00.591 --> 00:07:04.520
<v Speaker 2>recreational marijuana is legal only </v>
<v Speaker 2>Washington as a higher tax rate at about</v>

132
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:09.521
<v Speaker 2>50% Colorado and Nevada both follow with</v>
<v Speaker 2>rates of 36% Oregon has a tax of 20% and</v>

133
00:07:10.071 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 2>Alaska has a rate of up to 20% Aaron </v>
<v Speaker 2>Smith,</v>

134
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:13.843
<v Speaker 2>a CNN reporter,</v>
<v Speaker 2>however you had to wait a minutes </v>

135
00:07:15.501 --> 00:07:19.910
<v Speaker 2>because everything doesn't end here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's just say that there's a problem.</v>

136
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.770
<v Speaker 2>I'm very serious problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in fact,</v>

137
00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.790
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>federal us,</v>

138
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:31.210
<v Speaker 2>nor continues to consider this a </v>
<v Speaker 2>forbidden activity which makes this type</v>

139
00:07:31.211 --> 00:07:34.330
<v Speaker 2>of business very difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not impossible when it comes to,</v>

140
00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:35.193
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>obtaining credits from the financial </v>

141
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 2>institution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

142
00:07:37.631 --> 00:07:40.360
<v Speaker 2>if a bank decides to finance these </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies activities,</v>

143
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:44.200
<v Speaker 2>they could even be accused of </v>
<v Speaker 2>collaborating with a drug trafficker and</v>

144
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:45.063
<v Speaker 2>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>see until now a policy in stools by the </v>

145
00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.463
<v Speaker 2>Obama Administration was in force,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which led to the Justice Department </v>

146
00:07:51.821 --> 00:07:52.654
<v Speaker 2>asking federal prosecutors not to file </v>
<v Speaker 2>charges if the drug's production sale </v>

147
00:07:56.081 --> 00:07:59.050
<v Speaker 2>and consumption with legal based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>state laws.</v>

148
00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.233
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this policy known as the Cole memo was </v>

149
00:08:02.651 --> 00:08:03.484
<v Speaker 2>suspended by Jeff sessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Donald trump's appointed attorney </v>

150
00:08:05.861 --> 00:08:06.694
<v Speaker 2>general.</v>

151
00:08:06.740 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 6>This drug is dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You cannot play with it.</v>

152
00:08:09.531 --> 00:08:10.364
<v Speaker 6>It's not funny.</v>
<v Speaker 6>It's not something to laugh about and </v>

153
00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.333
<v Speaker 6>and trying to send that message with </v>
<v Speaker 6>clarity that good people don't smoke </v>

154
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:18.970
<v Speaker 6>marijuana.</v>

155
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:22.150
<v Speaker 2>The prosecutor has announced that he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants to prosecute marijuana businesses,</v>

156
00:08:22.151 --> 00:08:24.940
<v Speaker 2>which by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>trump promised he wouldn't do during his</v>

157
00:08:24.941 --> 00:08:27.460
<v Speaker 2>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But I think in terms of marijuana,</v>

158
00:08:27.461 --> 00:08:28.780
<v Speaker 2>I think,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and legalization,</v>

159
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:30.760
<v Speaker 2>I think that should be a state issue </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

160
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:32.013
<v Speaker 2>This is why this entirely new industry </v>
<v Speaker 2>is now submerged in a sea of </v>

161
00:08:34.421 --> 00:08:36.340
<v Speaker 2>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will be attorney general,</v>

162
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:39.940
<v Speaker 2>fulfill his wishes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Will the trump administration attack the</v>

163
00:08:39.941 --> 00:08:42.400
<v Speaker 2>marijuana industry?</v>
<v Speaker 2>These are the questions on the table,</v>

164
00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:43.263
<v Speaker 2>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only the future can answer for now </v>

165
00:08:44.651 --> 00:08:45.484
<v Speaker 2>though.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can discuss why this change in </v>

166
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:47.494
<v Speaker 2>approach could be a huge,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm of changes a few years since </v>

167
00:09:00.211 --> 00:09:01.044
<v Speaker 2>Colorado became the first states in 2014</v>
<v Speaker 2>to legalize the recreational use of </v>

168
00:09:04.831 --> 00:09:07.050
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just as we've seen in this video,</v>

169
00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:08.940
<v Speaker 2>a few more states have joined since </v>
<v Speaker 2>then,</v>

170
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:09.803
<v Speaker 2>so we can now analyze what's happens and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can look at this policy's </v>

171
00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.960
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The time legalization critic stated that</v>

172
00:09:19.391 --> 00:09:23.200
<v Speaker 2>the risks of allowing the recreational </v>
<v Speaker 2>use of cannabis were really high.</v>

173
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:25.570
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they said consumption among miners would</v>

174
00:09:25.571 --> 00:09:28.660
<v Speaker 2>probably increase as would crime and </v>
<v Speaker 2>traffic accidents.</v>

175
00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:30.650
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now we can see what actually happens and</v>

176
00:09:30.651 --> 00:09:34.270
<v Speaker 2>it's not just the truth is nothing like </v>
<v Speaker 2>these catastrophic predictions.</v>

177
00:09:34.330 --> 00:09:35.163
<v Speaker 2>Neither violence nor consumption among </v>
<v Speaker 2>miners and our traffic accidents have </v>

178
00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:38.650
<v Speaker 2>increased.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

179
00:09:38.710 --> 00:09:41.410
<v Speaker 2>legalization has had very positive </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences</v>

180
00:09:45.490 --> 00:09:46.323
<v Speaker 2>on the one hand and the quality of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>product sold on the black market has </v>

181
00:09:48.131 --> 00:09:48.964
<v Speaker 2>increased in consumption of more </v>
<v Speaker 2>dangerous substances has actually </v>

182
00:09:51.461 --> 00:09:52.294
<v Speaker 2>decreased in the states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Legalization of marijuana for </v>

183
00:09:55.091 --> 00:09:59.140
<v Speaker 2>recreational use has given us consumers </v>
<v Speaker 2>access to high quality marijuana.</v>

184
00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:01.280
<v Speaker 2>We genetically improve strains,</v>
<v Speaker 2>groaning,</v>

185
00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:02.163
<v Speaker 2>greenhouses or rule beneath does manawat</v>
<v Speaker 2>a drug war expert at Mexico's National </v>

186
00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.330
<v Speaker 2>Autonomous University and keep listening</v>
<v Speaker 2>here because this is really important.</v>

187
00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.253
<v Speaker 2>A few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Cato Institute published a study </v>

188
00:10:13.151 --> 00:10:16.420
<v Speaker 2>that determines that eight out of 10 </v>
<v Speaker 2>deaths caused by drugs.</v>

189
00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.580
<v Speaker 2>What do you to the product?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Poor quality.</v>

190
00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:23.610
<v Speaker 2>This is a major social problem,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so consumption except for medicine we'll</v>

191
00:10:24.881 --> 00:10:26.940
<v Speaker 2>use is never good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That certainly clear,</v>

192
00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:27.783
<v Speaker 2>but there's still the demands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is why improving the product </v>

193
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:33.550
<v Speaker 2>quality and safety reduces or potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>damage,</v>

194
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:34.450
<v Speaker 2>but there's more hair</v>

195
00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.980
<v Speaker 2>legalization is reducing as logical the </v>
<v Speaker 2>cartels business and therefore the money</v>

196
00:10:41.981 --> 00:10:44.140
<v Speaker 2>that these groups receive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

197
00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:46.490
<v Speaker 2>and this is perhaps its most important </v>
<v Speaker 2>effects,</v>

198
00:10:46.540 --> 00:10:49.690
<v Speaker 2>it has allowed a marijuana trafficking </v>
<v Speaker 2>related arrests do drop,</v>

199
00:10:49.691 --> 00:10:54.691
<v Speaker 2>which has had two very clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences for one security forces and</v>

200
00:10:55.001 --> 00:10:55.834
<v Speaker 2>courts have been able to allocate more </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources to fighting serious crime and </v>

201
00:10:58.841 --> 00:10:59.674
<v Speaker 2>for another it has reduced the number of</v>
<v Speaker 2>people in prison for victimless crimes </v>

202
00:11:02.410 --> 00:11:03.243
<v Speaker 2>like marijuana consumption.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say that in the states that </v>

203
00:11:05.561 --> 00:11:07.870
<v Speaker 2>opted for legalization,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the culture of violence,</v>

204
00:11:07.871 --> 00:11:11.080
<v Speaker 2>which is a serious problem in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States has decreased.</v>

205
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.953
<v Speaker 2>And if that one's enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>legalization means that the governments </v>

206
00:11:15.521 --> 00:11:18.010
<v Speaker 2>can now collect taxes from this </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

207
00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:21.460
<v Speaker 2>So if the United States wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>decrease its high consumption rates,</v>

208
00:11:21.490 --> 00:11:24.760
<v Speaker 2>it looks like a legalizing marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe a really good idea.</v>

209
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:32.150
<v Speaker 2>Legalization sheds light on a business </v>
<v Speaker 2>that has been in the shadows until now,</v>

210
00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:35.180
<v Speaker 2>while allowing for a safer and better </v>
<v Speaker 2>controlled products.</v>

211
00:11:35.210 --> 00:11:36.043
<v Speaker 2>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the authorities get allocate the money </v>

212
00:11:37.221 --> 00:11:38.054
<v Speaker 2>obtained through this industry's taxes </v>
<v Speaker 2>to carry out awareness and health </v>

213
00:11:40.551 --> 00:11:41.384
<v Speaker 2>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that my the way was very </v>

214
00:11:42.651 --> 00:11:45.200
<v Speaker 2>successful in Portugal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's something we're going to talk</v>

215
00:11:45.201 --> 00:11:46.160
<v Speaker 2>about in another video.</v>

216
00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:49.573
<v Speaker 2>The fact is maybe due to all of this </v>
<v Speaker 2>polls showed that more than 60% of </v>

217
00:11:52.131 --> 00:11:52.964
<v Speaker 2>Americans favor legalization.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More states are continuing to announce </v>

218
00:12:01.161 --> 00:12:01.994
<v Speaker 2>their intention to legalize marijuana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not only for medical use but also for </v>

219
00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:06.093
<v Speaker 2>recreational.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is certainly something that's </v>

220
00:12:07.421 --> 00:12:08.254
<v Speaker 2>becoming a trend.</v>

221
00:12:10.490 --> 00:12:11.323
<v Speaker 2>In 2013 year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I became the first country in the world </v>

222
00:12:13.461 --> 00:12:14.294
<v Speaker 2>to legalize the production,</v>
<v Speaker 2>distribution and consumption of </v>

223
00:12:16.341 --> 00:12:17.174
<v Speaker 2>marijuana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Although it is highly regulated that in </v>

224
00:12:18.921 --> 00:12:19.754
<v Speaker 2>the year 2018 everything indicates the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canada is going to follow in his </v>

225
00:12:22.341 --> 00:12:23.174
<v Speaker 2>footsteps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At least that's what Prime Minister </v>

226
00:12:24.381 --> 00:12:25.214
<v Speaker 2>Justin Trudeau has promised.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The reason we are choosing to legalize </v>

227
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:34.220
<v Speaker 2>control marijuana is because the current</v>
<v Speaker 2>system is not protecting our kids.</v>

228
00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.640
<v Speaker 2>It's right now easier for a an underage </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian,</v>

229
00:12:37.641 --> 00:12:40.370
<v Speaker 2>the teenager to buy a joint,</v>
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

230
00:12:40.371 --> 00:12:42.560
<v Speaker 2>than it is for them to get their hands </v>
<v Speaker 2>on a bottle of beer.</v>

231
00:12:42.620 --> 00:12:43.453
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>just as an extra hit about 80 cannabis </v>

232
00:12:45.441 --> 00:12:49.670
<v Speaker 2>related companies are listed on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Canadian Stock Exchange and in 2017 they</v>

233
00:12:49.671 --> 00:12:53.270
<v Speaker 2>revalued by no less than 250% not bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

234
00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:58.220
<v Speaker 2>It seems like a new industry is </v>
<v Speaker 2>developing a new industry in which among</v>
