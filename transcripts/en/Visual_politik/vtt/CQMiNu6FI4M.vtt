1
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.690
<v Speaker 1>If you've been following visual politics</v>
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>

2
00:00:06.691 --> 00:00:07.524
<v Speaker 1>you already know that Argentina is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>dire straits and they need to ask for </v>

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.620
<v Speaker 1>loans from international investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In these cases,</v>

4
00:00:13.621 --> 00:00:17.450
<v Speaker 1>the usual procedure is to print what we </v>
<v Speaker 1>call a debt bonds.</v>

5
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>This is a piece of paper that says,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you give me this amount of money,</v>

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.400
<v Speaker 1>I'll give it back to you in say 10 years</v>
<v Speaker 1>with some interest far so good,</v>

7
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.210
<v Speaker 1>but that's mentioned this situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say that you lend three thousands,</v>

8
00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:37.750
<v Speaker 1>Argentinian pesos to the Argentinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments at the time.</v>

9
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:40.090
<v Speaker 1>We're making this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the summer of 2018,</v>

10
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.780
<v Speaker 1>those 3000 pesos equal a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>American dollars,</v>

11
00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.970
<v Speaker 1>but what would happen in the year 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>28?</v>

12
00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is we just don't know,</v>

13
00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:49.354
<v Speaker 1>but the chances are the Argentinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency will have been devalued more </v>

14
00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>and more by then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe 3000 pesos wouldn't even buy you a</v>

15
00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:56.810
<v Speaker 1>bag of Doritos.</v>

16
00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

17
00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>This is why international investors </v>
<v Speaker 1>smart as they are,</v>

18
00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.760
<v Speaker 1>say to Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

19
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:07.660
<v Speaker 1>dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

20
00:01:07.661 --> 00:01:08.494
<v Speaker 1>I will lend you the money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you got to denominate that debt in </v>

21
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:11.500
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>

22
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>American dollar is not your funky </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars this way.</v>

23
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.060
<v Speaker 1>I give you $300 and you give me back </v>
<v Speaker 1>$300 plus interest.</v>

24
00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 1>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My dear viewer,</v>

25
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:24.610
<v Speaker 1>this is how an investor protects himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>from would be devaluations,</v>

26
00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.840
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second here because we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>not just talking about Argentina.</v>

27
00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:29.733
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most the world's countries choose the </v>

28
00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.800
<v Speaker 1>greenback as the currency in which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue that notes,</v>

29
00:01:35.801 --> 00:01:40.801
<v Speaker 1>and this is why you can read headlines </v>
<v Speaker 1>like this in every financial newspaper,</v>

30
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.103
<v Speaker 1>Mexican government will issue bonds </v>
<v Speaker 1>denominated in US dollars to be repaid </v>

31
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.910
<v Speaker 1>in 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

32
00:01:50.911 --> 00:01:53.180
<v Speaker 1>we're not just talking about government </v>
<v Speaker 1>set.</v>

33
00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.930
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anytime Aramco,</v>

34
00:01:54.931 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 1>the Saudi Arabian Oil Company wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell their dinosaur juice to say India.</v>

35
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.960
<v Speaker 1>They'll say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

36
00:02:00.961 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>hold on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are these?</v>

37
00:02:03.081 --> 00:02:05.240
<v Speaker 1>I don't even know how much these coins </v>
<v Speaker 1>are worth.</v>

38
00:02:05.241 --> 00:02:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Do you got to pay in dollars?</v>
<v Speaker 1>My Man American dollars?</v>

39
00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.660
<v Speaker 3>Because that is the currency I can </v>
<v Speaker 3>trust.</v>

40
00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.553
<v Speaker 3>This explains why 60 percent of all </v>
<v Speaker 3>foreign currency reserves around the </v>

41
00:02:15.851 --> 00:02:20.851
<v Speaker 3>world are held in dollars for one point </v>
<v Speaker 3>six,</v>

42
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:26.950
<v Speaker 3>$7,000,000,000,000 in circulation around</v>
<v Speaker 3>the world.</v>

43
00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.470
<v Speaker 3>More than half of them are outside the </v>
<v Speaker 3>United States.</v>

44
00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.333
<v Speaker 3>There is no international law that says </v>
<v Speaker 3>that the dollar must be used as the </v>

45
00:02:33.521 --> 00:02:34.354
<v Speaker 3>global reference,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but most people trust the dollar as the </v>

46
00:02:36.791 --> 00:02:41.350
<v Speaker 3>currency for international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>And here comes the big question.</v>

47
00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:43.480
<v Speaker 3>What is this use for?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>

48
00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.463
<v Speaker 3>how does America benefit from having </v>
<v Speaker 3>their currency circulating all over the </v>

49
00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 3>place?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

50
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:49.803
<v Speaker 3>it kind of depends.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you're a company or a regular </v>

51
00:02:51.431 --> 00:02:54.010
<v Speaker 3>citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this is completely irrelevant for you.</v>

52
00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.850
<v Speaker 1>We could say it's actually worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you are the American government's</v>

53
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.830
<v Speaker 1>well having a good time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So why having a good time?</v>

54
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.793
<v Speaker 1>I'll let me explain full of dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We told you a thousand times aerovision </v>

55
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.143
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst thing that can happen to a </v>

56
00:03:13.991 --> 00:03:14.824
<v Speaker 1>currency as hyperinflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that all of a sudden prices </v>

57
00:03:18.011 --> 00:03:23.011
<v Speaker 1>go absolutely sky high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how is hyperinflation created in the</v>

58
00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:24.694
<v Speaker 1>first place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

59
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.910
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to this,</v>

60
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:30.744
<v Speaker 1>in most cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is a 100 percent monetary </v>

61
00:03:34.091 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If central banks printing money,</v>

62
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:38.790
<v Speaker 1>like there's no tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the currency devalues,</v>

63
00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.633
<v Speaker 1>but why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the connection between printing </v>

64
00:03:41.261 --> 00:03:44.290
<v Speaker 1>money and losing the value of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>

65
00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:46.000
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when we talk about currency,</v>

66
00:03:46.001 --> 00:03:48.640
<v Speaker 1>we have to consider it just like any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other products.</v>

67
00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:49.241
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

68
00:03:49.241 --> 00:03:50.074
<v Speaker 1>That right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Currencies work under the same </v>

69
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:54.550
<v Speaker 1>principles as oil or oranges or mobile </v>
<v Speaker 1>phones,</v>

70
00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 1>and that of course there's supply and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand.</v>

71
00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:57.794
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Venezuelan bolivar has very little </v>

72
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:01.024
<v Speaker 1>demand they need Venezuelans uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So when the Central Bank of Venezuela </v>

73
00:04:03.911 --> 00:04:04.744
<v Speaker 1>print see ton of boulevard,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this expands the supply of the currency </v>

74
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.393
<v Speaker 1>and the price falls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the currency devalues </v>

75
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demands for the American dollar.</v>

76
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.094
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody around the globe uses it for </v>

77
00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:18.814
<v Speaker 1>international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the Federal Reserve has </v>

78
00:04:20.831 --> 00:04:25.210
<v Speaker 1>a huge margin to print money before </v>
<v Speaker 1>risking any sort of evaluation.</v>

79
00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>And you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.800
<v Speaker 1>why would the Federal Reserve wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>print more</v>

81
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:29.733
<v Speaker 2>money?</v>

82
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:37.860
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's have a look at an example.</v>

83
00:04:37.861 --> 00:04:38.694
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you've lent $100 to the American</v>
<v Speaker 1>government and now you want them to pay </v>

84
00:04:42.001 --> 00:04:44.340
<v Speaker 1>you back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you go to the American government and</v>

85
00:04:44.341 --> 00:04:45.870
<v Speaker 1>they're essentially tell you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sure man,</v>

86
00:04:45.871 --> 00:04:46.920
<v Speaker 1>I ain't got your money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much is it?</v>

87
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:48.090
<v Speaker 1>$100.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

88
00:04:48.091 --> 00:04:48.924
<v Speaker 1>Do you just go to that building?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one next door is a big federal </v>

89
00:04:51.211 --> 00:04:52.044
<v Speaker 1>reserve on the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Go in there and tell them to print you </v>

90
00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.630
<v Speaker 1>100 bucks and now whip it out in just a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>

91
00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:58.583
<v Speaker 1>No worries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This process is called monetizing debt </v>

92
00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:03.720
<v Speaker 1>and when you tell things like this to </v>
<v Speaker 1>your smart ass friend,</v>

93
00:05:03.721 --> 00:05:05.760
<v Speaker 1>the one who thinks he's an expert in Geo</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

94
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.070
<v Speaker 1>he will have no idea what you're talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about,</v>

95
00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.240
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that this hegemonic </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency is what allows America to issue</v>

96
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:16.050
<v Speaker 1>more and more debt and do it more easily</v>
<v Speaker 1>than any other country.</v>

97
00:05:16.051 --> 00:05:19.500
<v Speaker 1>And this is why it is so normal to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>headlines.</v>

98
00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:28.720
<v Speaker 4>Gas,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the crisis is coming.</v>

99
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 4>Interest payments will hit a trillion </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars a year.</v>

100
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:37.660
<v Speaker 1>Having such a big debt is not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>great news for American taxpayers.</v>

101
00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.780
<v Speaker 1>In this previous video we told you </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly why,</v>

102
00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:41.793
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second because I can </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably guess what you're thinking </v>

103
00:05:43.301 --> 00:05:44.560
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're probably thinking,</v>

104
00:05:44.561 --> 00:05:45.394
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't America as irresponsible with its </v>

105
00:05:46.841 --> 00:05:49.960
<v Speaker 1>monetary policy is Argentina or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela?</v>

106
00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.060
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

107
00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.983
<v Speaker 1>the absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see all the central banks print new </v>

108
00:05:55.211 --> 00:05:58.460
<v Speaker 1>bills year after year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only do they print it,</v>

109
00:05:58.461 --> 00:06:00.950
<v Speaker 1>but they generate more money </v>
<v Speaker 1>electronically as well.</v>

110
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 1>The difference is just on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>proportions on this chart,</v>

111
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:07.020
<v Speaker 1>you can see the increase of the monetary</v>
<v Speaker 1>supply,</v>

112
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:11.000
<v Speaker 1>what we call the end to indicator of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>American Federal Reserve.</v>

113
00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:11.953
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of dollars grows year after </v>

114
00:06:14.001 --> 00:06:14.834
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But what happens if we compare it with </v>

115
00:06:16.431 --> 00:06:19.370
<v Speaker 1>say the Argentinian peso?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:20.323
<v Speaker 1>she could see the difference and what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when we compare it with the </v>

117
00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan boulevard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:27.500
<v Speaker 1>I need to comment here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and just nine years,</v>

119
00:06:27.501 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is multiplied them monetary </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply by 100,</v>

120
00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 1>but America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've not even doubled.</v>

121
00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.130
<v Speaker 1>Now for a bonus facts while making this </v>
<v Speaker 1>chart,</v>

122
00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:38.964
<v Speaker 1>we decided not to include the year 2018 </v>
<v Speaker 1>because otherwise the yellow part would </v>

123
00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:43.313
<v Speaker 1>just cover everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This year the Central Bank of Venezuela </v>

124
00:06:45.660 --> 00:06:49.500
<v Speaker 1>is multiplied than monetary supply by </v>
<v Speaker 1>for thousands,</v>

125
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.550
<v Speaker 1>and this is why the American dollar is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most used currency on the planet and</v>

126
00:06:53.551 --> 00:06:54.384
<v Speaker 1>that's because it's stable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While other central banks print money </v>

127
00:06:56.821 --> 00:06:57.654
<v Speaker 1>like crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Federal Reserve is actually pretty </v>

128
00:06:59.791 --> 00:07:01.380
<v Speaker 1>responsible and they might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

129
00:07:01.381 --> 00:07:04.080
<v Speaker 1>what about other agencies like the Swiss</v>
<v Speaker 1>franc or the British pounds?</v>

130
00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:04.973
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one stable currency in the </v>

131
00:07:06.031 --> 00:07:06.511
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

132
00:07:06.511 --> 00:07:08.250
<v Speaker 1>It's got to be the Swiss franc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

133
00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:09.323
<v Speaker 1>Well your rights in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to this part of the video </v>

134
00:07:11.191 --> 00:07:14.780
<v Speaker 1>because this is going to surprise you </v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the importance.</v>

135
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.920
<v Speaker 1>It is not the only reserve currency on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet far from us.</v>

136
00:07:18.921 --> 00:07:20.130
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So check this out.</v>

137
00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:25.683
<v Speaker 3>Multicurrency world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We said it at the beginning of this </v>

138
00:07:27.461 --> 00:07:28.294
<v Speaker 3>video.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Sixty percent of the foreign currency </v>

139
00:07:29.741 --> 00:07:32.740
<v Speaker 3>reserves a hells in greenbacks,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but well,</v>

140
00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:33.583
<v Speaker 3>what about the other 40 percent?</v>
<v Speaker 3>The second most used currency in the </v>

141
00:07:36.581 --> 00:07:37.414
<v Speaker 3>world as a reserve currency is the euro </v>
<v Speaker 3>which represents about 20 percent of </v>

142
00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:42.333
<v Speaker 3>global foreign currency reserves for </v>
<v Speaker 3>that follows the Japanese yen and the </v>

143
00:07:49.831 --> 00:07:50.664
<v Speaker 3>sterling pound.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But these are not the only currencies </v>

144
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:53.813
<v Speaker 3>used as reserve currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Many central banks also hold Australian </v>

145
00:07:56.881 --> 00:07:59.550
<v Speaker 3>dollars brief and Swiss francs as </v>
<v Speaker 3>reserves.</v>

146
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:00.413
<v Speaker 3>But the question here is,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if what you need for a currency to have </v>

147
00:08:02.581 --> 00:08:06.510
<v Speaker 3>a high demand is to be stable,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why don't we use Swiss francs as much as</v>

148
00:08:06.511 --> 00:08:07.344
<v Speaker 3>we use?</v>

149
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.020
<v Speaker 2>And the</v>

150
00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.980
<v Speaker 1>answer simply is because there are way </v>
<v Speaker 1>less Swiss francs.</v>

151
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:15.843
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland has eight point 5 million </v>

152
00:08:17.381 --> 00:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States,</v>

153
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.803
<v Speaker 1>they got 300 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the Swiss National Bank </v>

154
00:08:22.130 --> 00:08:22.963
<v Speaker 1>doesn't need to issue as many bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The how I said that the world has one </v>

155
00:08:26.351 --> 00:08:28.060
<v Speaker 1>point six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$7,000,000,000,000 in it,</v>

156
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:30.790
<v Speaker 1>while the Swiss franc doesn't even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a single tridion.</v>

157
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 1>This means that it's harder to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>frank's than it is to find dollars to do</v>

158
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:37.240
<v Speaker 1>a transaction on the other hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>America is the world's biggest market.</v>

159
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.103
<v Speaker 1>This means that thousands of companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>from all over the world sell their </v>

160
00:08:40.391 --> 00:08:41.224
<v Speaker 1>product set.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So imagine you're an Australian company </v>

161
00:08:42.821 --> 00:08:45.280
<v Speaker 1>and you're selling mobile phones in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York.</v>

162
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.660
<v Speaker 1>How do they pay you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

163
00:08:46.810 --> 00:08:49.030
<v Speaker 1>of course they'd be paying you with </v>
<v Speaker 1>American dollars.</v>

164
00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:51.460
<v Speaker 1>So what do you then do with those green </v>
<v Speaker 1>bags?</v>

165
00:08:51.461 --> 00:08:52.294
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've changed them to your local </v>

166
00:08:53.081 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now he will have the American cash.</v>

167
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course that would be the Australian </v>

168
00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:01.050
<v Speaker 1>Bank where you made the exchange.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

169
00:09:01.051 --> 00:09:01.884
<v Speaker 1>the more America trades with the worlds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the more dollars will circulate </v>

170
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:09.530
<v Speaker 1>around the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a currency that is stable,</v>

171
00:09:16.641 --> 00:09:17.474
<v Speaker 1>abundant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and supported by the biggest economy </v>

172
00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 1>decades ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No other currency can be a match for the</v>

173
00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:24.080
<v Speaker 1>green back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But as you know,</v>

174
00:09:24.110 --> 00:09:24.943
<v Speaker 1>the wells is certainly changing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at this point you can probably see </v>

175
00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:28.663
<v Speaker 1>where I'm going with this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of this video I asked </v>

176
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:33.170
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it possible that the dollar will lose</v>

177
00:09:33.171 --> 00:09:36.890
<v Speaker 1>their hedge money or at least be less </v>
<v Speaker 1>important than it is today?</v>

178
00:09:36.891 --> 00:09:39.350
<v Speaker 1>And the answer to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely</v>

179
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:44.780
<v Speaker 4>us trumpets,</v>
<v Speaker 4>America first.</v>

180
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:47.120
<v Speaker 4>The rest of the world is moving on.</v>

181
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:50.840
<v Speaker 1>We've been telling you week after week </v>
<v Speaker 1>here on visual politic that Donald trump</v>

182
00:09:50.841 --> 00:09:53.420
<v Speaker 1>wants to protect America from </v>
<v Speaker 1>international trade.</v>

183
00:09:53.570 --> 00:09:56.720
<v Speaker 1>His first move was to cancel the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade agreements with the EU and Asia.</v>

184
00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.760
<v Speaker 1>After this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he introduced terrorists to steal,</v>

185
00:09:58.761 --> 00:10:00.500
<v Speaker 1>so companies like Harley Davidson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

186
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:01.483
<v Speaker 1>leaving the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has also announced that he wants </v>

187
00:10:03.531 --> 00:10:04.364
<v Speaker 1>to end Nafta,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the trade agreements between </v>

188
00:10:06.321 --> 00:10:07.370
<v Speaker 1>the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

189
00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:08.960
<v Speaker 1>and Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

190
00:10:08.961 --> 00:10:12.470
<v Speaker 1>trump's America wants to isolate itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the international markets.</v>

191
00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.630
<v Speaker 1>So what does all this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:10:14.631 --> 00:10:15.464
<v Speaker 1>it means that these other countries will</v>
<v Speaker 1>have less dollars and you've got to add </v>

193
00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:19.640
<v Speaker 1>other news like this ends of the met.</v>

194
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:28.000
<v Speaker 4>Central banks are starting to replace </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollar reserves with the you are,</v>

195
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:29.003
<v Speaker 4>or maybe there's other</v>

196
00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.610
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one bond sale with sanctions threat near</v>

197
00:10:34.620 --> 00:10:37.100
<v Speaker 1>him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is true that the Chinese yuan used to</v>

198
00:10:37.101 --> 00:10:40.330
<v Speaker 1>be almost an unknown currency in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international markets.</v>

199
00:10:40.370 --> 00:10:43.010
<v Speaker 1>It was only used inside of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

200
00:10:43.011 --> 00:10:43.844
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some central banks are starting to buy </v>

201
00:10:45.681 --> 00:10:46.514
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course this doesn't mean that </v>

202
00:10:48.231 --> 00:10:52.310
<v Speaker 1>banks will start changing all of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars to this currency overnight.</v>

203
00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.710
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are any things we don't know about</v>

204
00:10:54.711 --> 00:10:55.544
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things that your friends that smart ass </v>

205
00:10:57.741 --> 00:11:01.190
<v Speaker 1>probably won't know about either,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry because in the following</v>

206

210
00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:18.650
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the dollar can maintain its</v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge money and the following decades,</v>

211
00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:20.360
<v Speaker 1>and if north,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are the currency do you think?</v>

212
00:11:20.361 --> 00:11:22.970
<v Speaker 1>Should substitute as maybe the yuan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe the euro,</v>

213
00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.410
<v Speaker 1>perhaps bitcoin.</v>
