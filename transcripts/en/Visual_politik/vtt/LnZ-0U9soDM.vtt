1
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>In 1991,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after several years of negotiations in a</v>

2
00:00:11.491 --> 00:00:13.380
<v Speaker 1>whole lot of tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Baltic states,</v>

3
00:00:13.381 --> 00:00:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Lithuania,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latvia,</v>

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>Estonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I finally managed to break away from the</v>

5
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:19.703
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They finally have the freedom that </v>

6
00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:21.354
<v Speaker 1>they've wanted for so then 50 years have</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed since the soldiers of the Red </v>

7
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.530
<v Speaker 1>Army occupying these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the years under the Soviets.</v>

8
00:00:46.531 --> 00:00:47.364
<v Speaker 1>Repression and fear were the basic </v>
<v Speaker 1>ingredients in the lives of the people </v>

9
00:00:50.341 --> 00:00:51.600
<v Speaker 1>in Estonia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latvia,</v>

10
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:52.523
<v Speaker 1>and Lithuania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's now have a look at some pretty </v>

11
00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.360
<v Speaker 1>alarming data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Lithuania alone,</v>

12
00:00:56.361 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>a country of little more than two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>5 million people.</v>

13
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.960
<v Speaker 1>These numbers were recorded.</v>

14
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.190
<v Speaker 2>200,000 people were arrested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>questioned and imprisoned.</v>

15
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.220
<v Speaker 2>One hundred and 32,000 people were </v>
<v Speaker 2>deported,</v>

16
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.790
<v Speaker 2>especially to Siberia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Seventy 5,000 prisoners,</v>

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.420
<v Speaker 2>deportees and partisans were eliminated </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Soviet regime</v>

18
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.500
<v Speaker 1>and of all of that wasn't enough at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time of their independence.</v>

19
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Poverty and shortages were everyday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reality is for all of the inhabitants of</v>

20
00:01:26.881 --> 00:01:27.714
<v Speaker 1>these countries.</v>

21
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.520
<v Speaker 2>I remember the days when the counters at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the shops and to Lynn were empty and the</v>

22
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:35.320
<v Speaker 2>people were starving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Economy,</v>

23
00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:37.450
<v Speaker 2>more or less had to be rebuilt from </v>
<v Speaker 2>scratch.</v>

24
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.493
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you have things have changed a lot </v>

25
00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.190
<v Speaker 1>more than I lost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

26
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.970
<v Speaker 1>from the very moment these countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>regains their independence,</v>

27
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.150
<v Speaker 1>they decided to bet it's all on </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy and freedom.</v>

28
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.440
<v Speaker 1>They were calling me today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the freest ones.</v>

29
00:01:55.441 --> 00:01:59.280
<v Speaker 1>They are members of the EU and NATO and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they prosper today.</v>

30
00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.143
<v Speaker 1>These are countries with very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>standards of living and they can really </v>

31
00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:03.684
<v Speaker 1>be considered rich countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The transformation it really has been </v>

32
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:07.700
<v Speaker 1>total and remark</v>

33
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:09.863
<v Speaker 3>that</v>

34
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.003
<v Speaker 1>they suffered along with the rest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world is through the financial crisis </v>

35
00:02:13.711 --> 00:02:17.640
<v Speaker 1>and it really seemed as if their </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies were on the verge of collapse.</v>

36
00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.520
<v Speaker 2>Economy contracts almost 18 percent in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the fourth quarter of 2009,</v>

37
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:25.603
<v Speaker 1>but against all odds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they manage to recover in a very short </v>

38
00:02:28.461 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 1>period of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

39
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 1>they became an example to other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries like Spain,</v>

40
00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:33.920
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Portugal,</v>

41
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.783
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole different thing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about being the </v>

42
00:02:37.341 --> 00:02:38.930
<v Speaker 1>future video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>

43
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.010
<v Speaker 1>we're going to focus on Lithuania and </v>
<v Speaker 1>talk about a problem that is shared by a</v>

44
00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:43.844
<v Speaker 1>lot of the countries in eastern Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I problem that today is actually one of </v>

45
00:02:46.971 --> 00:02:48.630
<v Speaker 1>the biggest threats to them.</v>

46
00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.690
<v Speaker 3>Future brain drain</v>

47
00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.853
<v Speaker 1>history of Lithuania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the Baltic states in general </v>

48
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>since their freedom in 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:03.813
<v Speaker 1>it's a history of success today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are modern open countries with </v>

50
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 1>prosperous economies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As with any good story.</v>

51
00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.370
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything is quite so pretty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

52
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.233
<v Speaker 1>That all issues these countries are </v>
<v Speaker 1>facing and today we're going to </v>

53
00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.210
<v Speaker 1>particularly focus on Lithuania in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

54
00:03:19.211 --> 00:03:21.460
<v Speaker 1>The biggest problem is brain drain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

55
00:03:21.461 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>That's emigration with an e and this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>no small problem for the country.</v>

56
00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.250
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

57
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.370
<v Speaker 2>Since 2004,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the country was integrated into the</v>

58
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.303
<v Speaker 2>EU,</v>
<v Speaker 2>mania has lost more than 10 percent of </v>

59
00:03:34.431 --> 00:03:38.180
<v Speaker 2>its population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is more than 300,000 people,</v>

60
00:03:38.181 --> 00:03:42.560
<v Speaker 2>especially young people have decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>pack up and move to a different country.</v>

61
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.830
<v Speaker 2>Most of those have chosen to move to the</v>
<v Speaker 2>United Kingdom.</v>

62
00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:47.920
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

63
00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.230
<v Speaker 1>While in western Europe and the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

64
00:03:50.231 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 1>they aren't concerned about immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Lithuania.</v>

65
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.560
<v Speaker 1>It is the other way around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are concerned about people leaving.</v>

66
00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:59.660
<v Speaker 1>They are worried that this might end up </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalizing the company.</v>

67
00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 2>Nineteen 90.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have lost about 800,000 people in for</v>

68
00:04:04.621 --> 00:04:06.510
<v Speaker 2>a small country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is a huge loss.</v>

69
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:07.373
<v Speaker 2>We're losing our youngest and brightest </v>
<v Speaker 2>and in the future we'll just have old </v>

70
00:04:10.441 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 2>people who will be dying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We will have a dying society</v>

71
00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:15.623
<v Speaker 1>and there's always the ones who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving tend to be the most capable and </v>

72
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.470
<v Speaker 1>best prepared to young people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's,</v>

73
00:04:19.471 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>of course has a significant impact on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country's economy.</v>

74
00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:23.063
<v Speaker 1>The number of young people working </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreases talent leaves the country and </v>

75
00:04:26.071 --> 00:04:26.904
<v Speaker 1>as the population ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not just a problem for </v>

76
00:04:30.241 --> 00:04:31.170
<v Speaker 1>Lithuania.</v>

77
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.833
<v Speaker 2>The early 19 nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some $20 million of central and eastern </v>

78
00:04:39.331 --> 00:04:40.164
<v Speaker 2>Europe's most talented workers have left</v>
<v Speaker 2>and they have headed largely to western </v>

79
00:04:43.531 --> 00:04:43.990
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

80
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>So who do you think has benefited from </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this?</v>

81
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Talent redistribution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

82
00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.883
<v Speaker 1>You got that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the wealthiest countries and that </v>

83
00:04:51.131 --> 00:04:55.510
<v Speaker 1>is why we have to be careful about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>messages being sensed by politicians who</v>

84
00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.290
<v Speaker 1>are attempting to criminalize </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration in order to get votes.</v>

85
00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.153
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking at you to reason me and </v>

86
00:05:01.601 --> 00:05:04.180
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean I know what you're thinking.</v>

87
00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:06.760
<v Speaker 1>If the Baltic countries have been so </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful,</v>

88
00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:07.623
<v Speaker 1>why are people leaving?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well because they all looking out for </v>

89
00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:13.090
<v Speaker 1>their own personal success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>

90
00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:17.200
<v Speaker 1>these countries have managed to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>a well prepared young population who can</v>

91
00:05:17.201 --> 00:05:20.740
<v Speaker 1>also speak English to you must haves </v>
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to looking for a future in</v>

92
00:05:20.741 --> 00:05:24.760
<v Speaker 1>another place and then we also have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that because of all the growth that</v>

93
00:05:24.761 --> 00:05:25.594
<v Speaker 1>has happened since 1991,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these people that can now leave the </v>

94
00:05:27.881 --> 00:05:31.080
<v Speaker 1>country in a comfortable way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is still the key questions you</v>

95
00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:31.923
<v Speaker 1>want sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why are they leaving if things aren't </v>

96
00:05:33.731 --> 00:05:34.930
<v Speaker 1>going so well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

97
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.270
<v Speaker 1>that's not really that hard to explain.</v>

98
00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:43.220
<v Speaker 3>No</v>

99
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:45.530
<v Speaker 2>salaries have improved a lot in the last</v>
<v Speaker 2>several years.</v>

100
00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:49.580
<v Speaker 2>The difference between the wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries is still quite big.</v>

101
00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:53.570
<v Speaker 2>As an example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the average salary in Lithuania is</v>

102
00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:54.404
<v Speaker 2>about 800 euros in United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is almost 2,500 euros or three times </v>

103
00:05:59.271 --> 00:06:00.104
<v Speaker 2>more.</v>

104
00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:00.900
<v Speaker 1>All of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:01.733
<v Speaker 1>I might leave you wondering whether this</v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive economic developments was </v>

106
00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.900
<v Speaker 1>actually good for the Baltic countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

107
00:06:06.901 --> 00:06:08.520
<v Speaker 1>we would say that overall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

108
00:06:08.521 --> 00:06:09.354
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly worth it's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does leave us with a couple of </v>

109
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:13.320
<v Speaker 1>very important questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

110
00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.350
<v Speaker 1>the first one is what is the cost of all</v>
<v Speaker 1>of this and seconds,</v>

111
00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.130
<v Speaker 1>how can they stop?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brain</v>

112
00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.123
<v Speaker 3>drank</v>

113
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:22.670
<v Speaker 2>putting an end to emigrate.</v>

114
00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:23.573
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

115
00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:24.923
<v Speaker 1>So stopping this brain drain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become a pretty major priority for </v>

116
00:06:27.411 --> 00:06:30.560
<v Speaker 1>Eastern European countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of these countries like Poland,</v>

117
00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:31.670
<v Speaker 1>Latvia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Hungary,</v>

118
00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:32.533
<v Speaker 1>they have started a return campaign in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to persuade immigrants to come </v>

119
00:06:36.171 --> 00:06:37.004
<v Speaker 1>back home.</v>

120
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:40.960
<v Speaker 2>Welcome all Polish people who went </v>
<v Speaker 2>abroad.</v>

121
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.890
<v Speaker 2>If only they could come back,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it would be a great day for Poland.</v>

122
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:46.450
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

123
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.680
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while this,</v>

124
00:06:47.681 --> 00:06:48.514
<v Speaker 1>it's a nice sentiment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is definitely in Lithuania where </v>

125
00:06:50.651 --> 00:06:51.484
<v Speaker 1>there is a larger concern about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>brain drain that the has been more </v>

126
00:06:54.131 --> 00:06:56.320
<v Speaker 1>significant support from society.</v>

127
00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:04.660
<v Speaker 2>The last parliamentary elections </v>
<v Speaker 2>celebrated in October.</v>

128
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:05.673
<v Speaker 2>The Lithuanian Greens and Farmers Union </v>
<v Speaker 2>won the elections and took control of </v>

129
00:07:09.791 --> 00:07:10.624
<v Speaker 2>the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is pinterest party had only one MP in </v>

130
00:07:13.361 --> 00:07:15.520
<v Speaker 2>the previous elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their main promise,</v>

131
00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 2>putting an end to immigration,</v>

132
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:21.880
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course this is easier said than done,</v>

133
00:07:21.881 --> 00:07:24.880
<v Speaker 1>so the question is how is this party </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to succeed?</v>

134
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:25.541
<v Speaker 1>Policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leds,</v>

135
00:07:25.541 --> 00:07:27.460
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by Ramina Cabal Skus,</v>

136
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:30.190
<v Speaker 1>one of the most important businessmen in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>

137
00:07:30.220 --> 00:07:34.810
<v Speaker 1>well apparently their top priority is to</v>
<v Speaker 1>stop immigration by attracting much more</v>

138
00:07:34.811 --> 00:07:35.644
<v Speaker 1>foreign investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They claim that if they can succeed in </v>

139
00:07:37.571 --> 00:07:39.370
<v Speaker 1>getting more foreign money for </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment,</v>

140
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:43.540
<v Speaker 1>they will be able to provide a more jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>with higher salaries so well,</v>

141
00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:47.200
<v Speaker 1>how are they planning to do this well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by reducing bureaucracy,</v>

142
00:07:47.201 --> 00:07:48.034
<v Speaker 1>chasing corruption,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and also by making adjustments to the </v>

143
00:07:49.901 --> 00:07:50.734
<v Speaker 1>labor markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that this does make a </v>

144
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:53.373
<v Speaker 1>ton of sense and we could say that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Baltic countries really do seem to know </v>

145
00:07:55.901 --> 00:07:56.734
<v Speaker 1>how to get things done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's hold on for just a second because </v>

146
00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:01.570
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the end of the story.</v>

147
00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:03.610
<v Speaker 1>There are some other things that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

148
00:08:03.611 --> 00:08:05.830
<v Speaker 1>they don't look quite so good.</v>

149
00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.830
<v Speaker 2>The shadows of the Lithuanian plan</v>

150
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:14.273
<v Speaker 1>on the one hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time as the government </v>

151
00:08:15.571 --> 00:08:16.404
<v Speaker 1>promised foreign investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have also committed to raise taxes </v>

152
00:08:19.411 --> 00:08:20.244
<v Speaker 1>by eliminating what is known as a flat </v>
<v Speaker 1>tax look in Lithuania as well as in </v>

153
00:08:23.971 --> 00:08:28.110
<v Speaker 1>Estonia and not be at the tax systems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Really symbol in Lithuania case.</v>

154
00:08:28.111 --> 00:08:31.860
<v Speaker 1>There is this flat tax which is a rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 15 percent for people and companies.</v>

155
00:08:31.890 --> 00:08:36.840
<v Speaker 1>That is to say that the Lithuanian who </v>
<v Speaker 1>makes $10,000 pays $1,500 in taxes,</v>

156
00:08:37.070 --> 00:08:40.000
<v Speaker 1>was the one who makes 10 times more at </v>
<v Speaker 1>100,000 euros,</v>

157
00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:43.020
<v Speaker 1>also pays 10 times more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>read 15,000 euros.</v>

158
00:08:43.050 --> 00:08:43.883
<v Speaker 1>Raising taxes in this way sort of goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the foreign investments and </v>

159
00:08:46.681 --> 00:08:50.970
<v Speaker 1>higher salaries plan and this rise will </v>
<v Speaker 1>direct harm both of those things,</v>

160
00:08:50.990 --> 00:08:52.580
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate taxes,</v>

161
00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:54.330
<v Speaker 1>they're not as low as they might seem.</v>

162
00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>If we up the social</v>

163
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:56.873
<v Speaker 1>security contributions and other taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies pay more than 40 percent of </v>

164
00:09:00.691 --> 00:09:03.600
<v Speaker 1>their gross profits in taxes according </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the World Bank.</v>

165
00:09:04.870 --> 00:09:06.100
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we also have to point this out.</v>

166
00:09:06.101 --> 00:09:06.934
<v Speaker 1>The issue of Russia and NATO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the previous Lithuanian governments and </v>

167
00:09:10.841 --> 00:09:11.674
<v Speaker 1>the current is no exception.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've insisted on scaring the population </v>

168
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:18.910
<v Speaker 1>and also the rest of the world with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian threat thing that the country is</v>

169
00:09:18.911 --> 00:09:20.320
<v Speaker 1>constantly in danger.</v>

170
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:22.671
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

171
00:09:22.671 --> 00:09:24.500
<v Speaker 1>while it is true that the threats are </v>
<v Speaker 1>real,</v>

172
00:09:24.501 --> 00:09:25.334
<v Speaker 1>it's not really a brilliant way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>instill confidence in potential </v>

173
00:09:28.401 --> 00:09:30.140
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally,</v>

174
00:09:30.141 --> 00:09:30.974
<v Speaker 1>and maybe most importantly of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a cultural matter that affects </v>

175
00:09:34.761 --> 00:09:37.100
<v Speaker 1>the entire country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might want to write if this,</v>

176
00:09:37.101 --> 00:09:37.934
<v Speaker 1>this brain drain going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be logical to try and </v>

177
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:43.760
<v Speaker 1>compensate for this by bringing in young</v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals from other countries?</v>

178
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:44.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's kind of a problem because this </v>

179
00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:46.934
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also a bit suspicious about </v>

180
00:09:48.471 --> 00:09:50.240
<v Speaker 1>immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of these countries,</v>

181
00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:53.960
<v Speaker 1>a touch nationalist anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything is full session,</v>

182
00:09:53.961 --> 00:09:54.794
<v Speaker 1>is that Lithuania is rather this stonier</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Latvia have done their homework and </v>

183
00:09:57.991 --> 00:10:01.610
<v Speaker 1>is that policies are certainly much more</v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient than the ones that predominate</v>

184
00:10:01.611 --> 00:10:03.040
<v Speaker 1>in the rest of Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember,</v>

185
00:10:03.110 --> 00:10:03.943
<v Speaker 1>in 25 years they have managed to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich countries with higher standards of </v>

186
00:10:07.761 --> 00:10:08.720
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:09.613
<v Speaker 1>now we'd like to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think these countries will </v>

188
00:10:11.271 --> 00:10:13.340
<v Speaker 1>finally be able to stop this brain </v>
<v Speaker 1>drain?</v>

189
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:14.203
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're looking forward to hearing what </v>
