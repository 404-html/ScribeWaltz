<v Speaker 1>Alphabet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google's parent company and owner of the</v>

2
00:00:07.801 --> 00:00:10.980
<v Speaker 1>Youtube platform visit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negotiating to build a technology center</v>

3
00:00:10.981 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>in none other than Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds incredible,</v>

4
00:00:14.461 --> 00:00:16.590
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that since Mohammed bin</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salman,</v>

5
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.820
<v Speaker 1>the crown prince takeover this country </v>
<v Speaker 1>has started to change a lot,</v>

6
00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:24.360
<v Speaker 1>at least much more than everyone would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have imagined just a few years ago.</v>

7
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:25.253
<v Speaker 1>So us today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at what exactly is </v>

8
00:00:26.731 --> 00:00:27.564
<v Speaker 1>happening in Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you understand what's happening in </v>

9
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:39.614
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to take a look at that past to </v>

10
00:00:41.541 --> 00:00:43.550
<v Speaker 1>see where everything began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:44.413
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to bear in mind that we're </v>

12
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>talking about a particularly young </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

13
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.423
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia was formally born in 1932.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then of course Saudi Arabia was really </v>

14
00:00:54.441 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>different to how it is today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

15
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.253
<v Speaker 1>back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many oil deposits hadn't yet been </v>

16
00:00:58.671 --> 00:00:59.504
<v Speaker 1>discovered,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was a very poor place that still </v>

17
00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>had a spouse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>semi nomadic population.</v>

18
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.650
<v Speaker 1>The Saudi Arabia was still kind of in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle Ages.</v>

19
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really a lot of things have actually </v>

20
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:20.940
<v Speaker 1>changed that much,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a few years later in 1938,</v>

21
00:01:20.941 --> 00:01:23.640
<v Speaker 1>the first oil deposits were discovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>and since then,</v>

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.533
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say that the house of sounds </v>

23
00:01:25.171 --> 00:01:26.004
<v Speaker 1>of the country's royal houses used oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>to make Arabia look like the United </v>

24
00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:30.743
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least in terms of aesthetics and </v>

25
00:01:31.651 --> 00:01:32.484
<v Speaker 1>leisure.</v>

26
00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me to explain myself.</v>

27
00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.443
<v Speaker 1>We're talking for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of cities inspired by Dallas' driving </v>

28
00:01:41.731 --> 00:01:42.564
<v Speaker 1>American cars and building huge moles in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle of the desert and that's </v>

29
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.840
<v Speaker 1>exactly what they did for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not only that.</v>

30
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.953
<v Speaker 1>Over the years the Saudi government you </v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks aisle has begun to have a lot of </v>

31
00:01:54.871 --> 00:01:55.704
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can do it kind of agreements with </v>

32
00:01:57.151 --> 00:02:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Washington that has lasted more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>until today.</v>

33
00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:01.193
<v Speaker 1>So check out disagreements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia generates a huge and </v>

34
00:02:03.691 --> 00:02:06.070
<v Speaker 1>relatively cheap oil supply using the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

35
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.260
<v Speaker 1>It's basic currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

36
00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:10.240
<v Speaker 1>you've probably heard of petro dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>and accumulate all the money,</v>

37
00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:15.290
<v Speaker 1>generates an oil sales in us treasury </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt or in the Big Wall Street banks,</v>

38
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.253
<v Speaker 1>and if that weren't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Saudi government is always willing </v>

39
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>to inject millions into the powerful US </v>
<v Speaker 1>owns industry.</v>

40
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.240
<v Speaker 2>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is</v>

41
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>lots of oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of money and great business for the</v>

42
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.030
<v Speaker 1>US military industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question becomes,</v>

43
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:35.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in exchange for watts,</v>

44
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.090
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who basically for protection,</v>

45
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.953
<v Speaker 1>the house of Saudi bought what </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially amounts to insurance from </v>

46
00:02:46.451 --> 00:02:48.880
<v Speaker 1>Washington to protect it from foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>

47
00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1979,</v>

48
00:02:51.251 --> 00:02:52.570
<v Speaker 1>everything changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

49
00:02:52.571 --> 00:02:53.404
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>79 was a fundamental year for Arabian </v>

50
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:59.560
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And for Islam on the one hand to Islamic</v>

51
00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.000
<v Speaker 1>revolution happens in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>

52
00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.500
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in Saudi Arabia,</v>

53
00:03:05.501 --> 00:03:07.510
<v Speaker 1>between November the 20th and December </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fourth,</v>

54
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:08.403
<v Speaker 1>a group of fanatics took over the Great </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mosque of Maca and accuse the house of </v>

55
00:03:11.861 --> 00:03:12.694
<v Speaker 1>Southie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi monarchy of betraying Islam and </v>

56
00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:15.784
<v Speaker 1>selling their soul to the west fanatics </v>
<v Speaker 1>called for an uprising to overthrow the </v>

57
00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:20.494
<v Speaker 1>royal family.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that if you are is where everything </v>

58
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.823
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house of Saudi leaders feared a </v>

59
00:03:25.031 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>revolutionary uprising and decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>please the extremists.</v>

60
00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.390
<v Speaker 1>The United States could certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>protect them from the foreign enemy,</v>

61
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:32.253
<v Speaker 1>but it will be very hard for them to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>soak in a popular uprising like the one </v>

62
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.003
<v Speaker 1>that happened in Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So even though this part of the world </v>

63
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:45.100
<v Speaker 1>wasn't exactly a paradise of freedom </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that Bermans on,</v>

64
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.800
<v Speaker 1>things got a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot worse.</v>

65
00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.970
<v Speaker 1>Discrimination against women reached </v>
<v Speaker 1>stratospheric levels,</v>

66
00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.833
<v Speaker 1>they religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>God began an uncontrolled campaign and </v>

67
00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.833
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia began to finance all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of extremist groups like there was no </v>

68
00:03:59.141 --> 00:04:01.960
<v Speaker 1>tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both inside and outside of the country.</v>

69
00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.960
<v Speaker 1>And that's precisely the Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll know how we'll just waste a moment</v>

70
00:04:07.961 --> 00:04:08.794
<v Speaker 1>because there was another turning point </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 this time thanks to you </v>

71
00:04:12.401 --> 00:04:16.720
<v Speaker 1>plummeting oil prices in the arrival of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a new King Salman Bin Abdulaziz.</v>

72
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:22.070
<v Speaker 2>Great flavor overall.</v>

73
00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.240
<v Speaker 1>This is a king who decided to give </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all the power to his son.</v>

74
00:04:28.241 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 1>And now his APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Bin Salmaan of here.</v>

75
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.820
<v Speaker 1>We already talked about here on visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic before.</v>

76
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.160
<v Speaker 1>That's a new generation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>took a hold of the country.</v>

77
00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:37.623
<v Speaker 1>My generation was held hostage by 1979.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know now that my kids will not be </v>

78
00:04:40.871 --> 00:04:43.540
<v Speaker 1>hostages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one Saudi banker to the New York Times.</v>

79
00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:44.350
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

80
00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.680
<v Speaker 1>a new kind of revolution has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched to modernize the country.</v>

81
00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:53.420
<v Speaker 1>We've already talked about this on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel,</v>

82
00:04:53.421 --> 00:04:54.254
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that the plan is </v>
<v Speaker 1>advancing at full speed and it's based </v>

83
00:04:57.471 --> 00:04:59.690
<v Speaker 1>on three pillars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fight against corruption,</v>

84
00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.120
<v Speaker 1>economic change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and religious reform.</v>

85
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:03.740
<v Speaker 1>So without further ado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

86
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.500
<v Speaker 1>let's see what's happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Point by point.</v>

87
00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.050
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia is anti corruption </v>
<v Speaker 2>crackdown.</v>

88
00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:13.190
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia detailing 11,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nearly 60 detainees,</v>

89
00:05:13.191 --> 00:05:14.120
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promptly removed.</v>

90
00:05:14.121 --> 00:05:14.954
<v Speaker 2>We're being told,</v>

91
00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.510
<v Speaker 3>sure.</v>

92
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Fight against corruption</v>

93
00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.810
<v Speaker 3>the ground.</v>

94
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.810
<v Speaker 1>Brent's has said it both actively and </v>
<v Speaker 1>passively.</v>

95
00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.290
<v Speaker 1>Corruption in Saudi Arabia is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>burden added,</v>

96
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.213
<v Speaker 1>has to rent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our country has suffered a lot from </v>

97
00:05:34.231 --> 00:05:36.450
<v Speaker 1>corruption from the 19 eighties until </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

98
00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:37.343
<v Speaker 1>The calculation of our experts is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>roughly 10 percent of all government </v>

99
00:05:39.391 --> 00:05:40.224
<v Speaker 1>spending was siphoned off by corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>each year from the top levels to the </v>

100
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:44.670
<v Speaker 1>bottom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,</v>

101
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:46.560
<v Speaker 1>as you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was as it was said,</v>

102
00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>so it was done last November,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's 2017 prince's businessmen,</v>

103
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:51.810
<v Speaker 1>ministersx,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

104
00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:52.703
<v Speaker 1>and a huge number of people were invited</v>
<v Speaker 1>to dine with the king or to meet with </v>

105
00:05:55.711 --> 00:05:57.060
<v Speaker 1>the crown prince.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

106
00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:01.160
<v Speaker 1>only in a country like Saudi Arabia that</v>
<v Speaker 1>we would see a prison like this.</v>

107
00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 1>This is the Ritz Carlton at reacts a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

108
00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:07.340
<v Speaker 1>very luxurious hotel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

109
00:06:07.341 --> 00:06:09.250
<v Speaker 1>nos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything was comfortable after all,</v>

110
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.010
<v Speaker 1>it became a prison that held such </v>
<v Speaker 1>illustrious prisoners as Prince Alwaleed</v>

111
00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>bin Talal grandson of the kingdoms own </v>
<v Speaker 1>founder,</v>

112
00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>known as the Warren Buffett of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Middle East.</v>

113
00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.330
<v Speaker 1>This is a prince who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to Forbes magazine,</v>

114
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:23.930
<v Speaker 1>has a fortunate to have almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>$18,000,000,000 in just one of twitter's</v>

115
00:06:23.931 --> 00:06:26.810
<v Speaker 1>largest shareholders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

116
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.673
<v Speaker 1>not even he,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even with all this money managed to </v>

117
00:06:28.911 --> 00:06:29.744
<v Speaker 1>escape all the prisoners were held </v>
<v Speaker 1>incommunicado and couldn't even contact </v>

118
00:06:33.441 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>their lawyers rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legal guarantees.</v>

119
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Come on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're in Saudi Arabia,</v>

120
00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think the Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>government asked for to release them?</v>

121
00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:42.853
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing less than giving part of their </v>

122
00:06:44.391 --> 00:06:45.224
<v Speaker 1>fortunes and companies as compensation </v>
<v Speaker 1>for all the corruption that they were </v>

123
00:06:47.931 --> 00:06:50.300
<v Speaker 1>involved in as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question.</v>

124
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.330
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how much the Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>government raised with this trick?</v>

125
00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.180
<v Speaker 1>This up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because this is an astounding number.</v>

126
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:57.103
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't one or five or 10 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it was approximately an one popping </v>

127
00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.350
<v Speaker 1>$107,000,000,000.</v>

128
00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

129
00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:12.200
<v Speaker 1>a few detractors have accused the crown </v>
<v Speaker 1>prince of carrying out this campaign,</v>

130
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:13.063
<v Speaker 1>not with the intention of fighting </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption class with the aim of </v>

131
00:07:15.471 --> 00:07:17.930
<v Speaker 1>strengthening his power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

132
00:07:17.931 --> 00:07:19.970
<v Speaker 1>seizing control of the foreign based </v>
<v Speaker 1>media.</v>

133
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:20.833
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the detainees included important media </v>

134
00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:23.654
<v Speaker 1>businessmen bots have you at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't end here also at all the </v>

135
00:07:34.191 --> 00:07:39.191
<v Speaker 1>economic change as we've mentioned on </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politics.</v>

136
00:07:40.151 --> 00:07:40.984
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia wants to emulate Dubai and </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave their dependence on oil behinds </v>

137
00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.023
<v Speaker 1>and they want to do it hand in hand with</v>
<v Speaker 1>private capital just as we saw in </v>

138
00:07:48.671 --> 00:07:49.504
<v Speaker 1>Google's case.</v>

139
00:07:52.090 --> 00:07:52.500
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>

140
00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.333
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also </v>

141
00:07:55.051 --> 00:07:55.884
<v Speaker 1>very fond of big projects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last one he publicized was Naomi </v>

142
00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:01.303
<v Speaker 1>Macro city that the government wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>build in the Red Sea next to Jordan and </v>

143
00:08:05.101 --> 00:08:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check out some of these numbers,</v>

144
00:08:08.710 --> 00:08:13.710
<v Speaker 1>500 $500,000,000,000 in public and </v>
<v Speaker 1>private investments in order to urbanize</v>

145
00:08:14.861 --> 00:08:18.460
<v Speaker 1>and build a city that is larger in area </v>
<v Speaker 1>than El Salvador.</v>

146
00:08:18.490 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 1>This is a 10,000 square mile place that </v>
<v Speaker 1>will have its own laws,</v>

147
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:25.960
<v Speaker 1>its own courts and its own taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a new city that the crown prince</v>

148
00:08:25.961 --> 00:08:29.920
<v Speaker 1>wants to turn into a great transport hub</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a huge international business center.</v>

149
00:08:31.640 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 1>Basically a much more modern and much </v>
<v Speaker 1>bigger Dubai,</v>

150
00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:36.193
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't his only project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia plans a huge Red Sea beach </v>

151
00:08:40.971 --> 00:08:41.804
<v Speaker 1>tourism project.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The project will cover 50 islands and </v>

152
00:08:43.641 --> 00:08:48.350
<v Speaker 1>34,000 square kilometers an area bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>than Belgium and there's a few more.</v>

153
00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.213
<v Speaker 1>Prince's idea is to get all these cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have laws and standards different </v>

154
00:08:52.461 --> 00:08:55.830
<v Speaker 1>from those in the rest of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laws they can attract investors,</v>

155
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>attract tourists and entrepreneurs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

156
00:08:58.890 --> 00:08:59.723
<v Speaker 1>will really be able to make all of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>projects work in a country that is so </v>

157
00:09:03.510 --> 00:09:04.410
<v Speaker 1>anchored in the past.</v>

158
00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:05.373
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

159
00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.950
<v Speaker 1>When he's like that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't seem easy at first,</v>

160
00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:12.813
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose we'll see so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People like Richard Branson certainly </v>

161
00:09:15.401 --> 00:09:16.510
<v Speaker 1>support the strategy,</v>

162
00:09:22.470 --> 00:09:23.730
<v Speaker 4>the religious change,</v>

163
00:09:26.490 --> 00:09:28.210
<v Speaker 1>sleep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's the religious changed,</v>

164
00:09:28.211 --> 00:09:29.044
<v Speaker 1>the princes latest and great obsession </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the struggle against Islamic </v>

165
00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:35.280
<v Speaker 1>fundamentalism or its most radical </v>
<v Speaker 1>interpretations.</v>

166
00:09:35.310 --> 00:09:36.143
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is a country of </v>

167
00:09:37.531 --> 00:09:38.364
<v Speaker 1>restrictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something we probably all know </v>

168
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 1>and it may never cease being so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

169
00:09:42.301 --> 00:09:43.134
<v Speaker 1>just a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody could have imagined we'd see so </v>

170
00:09:45.181 --> 00:09:49.950
<v Speaker 1>many changes and quite so quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerts and movies which had been bands</v>

171
00:09:49.951 --> 00:09:52.830
<v Speaker 1>have returned to the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The religious God has lost almost all of</v>

172
00:09:52.831 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>its power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Women can now attend sports stadiums and</v>

173
00:09:55.351 --> 00:10:00.351
<v Speaker 1>since June they can also drive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I go on any further.</v>

174
00:10:01.311 --> 00:10:03.080
<v Speaker 1>On December the sixth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

175
00:10:03.081 --> 00:10:06.800
<v Speaker 1>the Lebanese singer hereby to start in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia first.</v>

176
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.420
<v Speaker 1>All female concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

177
00:10:08.421 --> 00:10:09.254
<v Speaker 1>Even the audience was entirely made up </v>
<v Speaker 1>of women and this is something we </v>

178
00:10:11.541 --> 00:10:14.600
<v Speaker 1>couldn't even have imagined just three </v>
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>

179
00:10:14.690 --> 00:10:15.800
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this reflection,</v>

180
00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:20.510
<v Speaker 4>privileged to be the generation that has</v>
<v Speaker 4>seen the before and the after,</v>

181
00:10:20.570 --> 00:10:21.403
<v Speaker 4>the previous generation of Saudi.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Women could never imagine a day when a </v>

182
00:10:23.841 --> 00:10:27.320
<v Speaker 4>woman could drive and the coming </v>
<v Speaker 4>generation will never be able to imagine</v>

183
00:10:27.321 --> 00:10:28.154
<v Speaker 4>a day when a woman couldn't.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A 30 year old Saudi woman social </v>

184
00:10:30.111 --> 00:10:30.944
<v Speaker 4>entrepreneur to the New York Times.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The person in charge of this entire </v>

185
00:10:33.081 --> 00:10:38.081
<v Speaker 4>process is Mohammed bin Salman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We aren't restoring Islam to its origins</v>

186
00:10:41.710 --> 00:10:43.840
<v Speaker 4>and our biggest tools are the prophets </v>
<v Speaker 4>practices.</v>

187
00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:46.540
<v Speaker 4>At the time of the Prophet Mohammed,</v>
<v Speaker 4>there were musical theaters.</v>

188
00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.433
<v Speaker 4>There was mixing between men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 4>There's a SPEC for Christians and Jews </v>

189
00:10:50.111 --> 00:10:51.490
<v Speaker 4>and Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The first commercial,</v>

190
00:10:51.491 --> 00:10:54.760
<v Speaker 4>Judge Medina was a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 4>So if the profit embrace all of this,</v>

191
00:10:54.790 --> 00:10:56.830
<v Speaker 4>do you mean the profit was not a Muslim </v>
<v Speaker 4>crown?</v>

192
00:10:56.831 --> 00:10:58.180
<v Speaker 4>Prince Mohammed bin Salman</v>

193
00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:01.260
<v Speaker 1>for a Saudi Arabian data to say </v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this,</v>

194
00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:03.780
<v Speaker 1>while the only word is wow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

195
00:11:03.781 --> 00:11:07.410
<v Speaker 1>don't think that Saudi Arabia was always</v>
<v Speaker 1>the place it was in the past.</v>

196
00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was always a very,</v>

197
00:11:08.640 --> 00:11:11.070
<v Speaker 1>very conservative country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>conservative.</v>

198
00:11:11.071 --> 00:11:14.850
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not the hell that it became in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1979.</v>

199
00:11:14.930 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>The short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see,</v>

200
00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:18.300
<v Speaker 1>even though there's still a lot to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change,</v>

201
00:11:18.301 --> 00:11:19.134
<v Speaker 1>things seem to be on the right track.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although of course there are certainly </v>

202
00:11:22.771 --> 00:11:24.220
<v Speaker 1>still dark areas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He Qatar,</v>

203
00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:27.030
<v Speaker 1>blockade failure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Yemen war and the princess obsession</v>

204
00:11:27.031 --> 00:11:28.880
<v Speaker 1>with Taran ran</v>

205
00:11:29.200 --> 00:11:31.360
<v Speaker 4>team leader is the new Hitler of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>Middle East,</v>

206
00:11:31.420 --> 00:11:33.520
<v Speaker 4>but we learned from Europe that </v>
<v Speaker 4>appeasement doesn't work.</v>

207
00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:34.443
<v Speaker 4>We don't want the new Hitler in Iran to </v>
<v Speaker 4>repeat what happened in Europe in the </v>

208
00:11:37.990 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 4>Middle East,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.</v>

209
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.530
<v Speaker 1>This prince is a take charge kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

210
00:11:42.540 --> 00:11:43.373
<v Speaker 1>but to tell the truth so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his international attempts have been </v>

211
00:11:46.050 --> 00:11:46.883
<v Speaker 1>resounding failures as we saw with Yemen</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other problem is that the Arabic </v>

212
00:11:49.831 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economies are going from bad to worse.</v>

213
00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:55.870
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they suffered that first recession since</v>

214
00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:58.930
<v Speaker 1>2009 and public deficit is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketing,</v>

215
00:11:58.960 --> 00:12:01.420
<v Speaker 1>growing by more than $50 million dollars</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year,</v>

216
00:12:01.450 --> 00:12:04.840
<v Speaker 1>and of course that can make it hard for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the prince to carry out his plants.</v>

217
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:06.160
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having seen this,</v>

218
00:12:06.161 --> 00:12:09.610
<v Speaker 1>I think we can say that the oil was some</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the best news for everyone,</v>

219
00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.590
<v Speaker 1>especially for Saudi Arabian women,</v>

220
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:16.600
<v Speaker 4>turning to what we have done before,</v>
<v Speaker 4>a country of moderate Islam that is open</v>

221
00:12:16.601 --> 00:12:17.434
<v Speaker 4>to all religions and to the world.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will not spend the next 30 years of </v>

222
00:12:19.991 --> 00:12:21.910
<v Speaker 4>our lives dealing with destructive </v>
<v Speaker 4>ideas.</v>

223
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:24.940
<v Speaker 4>We will destroy them today.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We will end extremism very soon.</v>

224
00:12:25.150 --> 00:12:26.080
<v Speaker 4>Mohammed bin Salman.</v>

225
00:12:26.180 --> 00:12:27.500
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's how things are,</v>

226
00:12:27.501 --> 00:12:30.350
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Saudi Arabia will manage to</v>

227
00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.370
<v Speaker 1>change itself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
