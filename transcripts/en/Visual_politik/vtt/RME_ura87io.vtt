WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>So somebody who is of this channel often</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask us why we're the channel called </v>

2
00:00:02.551 --> 00:00:05.070
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We make videos about companies,</v>

3
00:00:05.071 --> 00:00:05.904
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already talked about Amazon into </v>

4
00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.340
<v Speaker 1>text and Tessa among many others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>we do this for two fundamental reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

6
00:00:11.941 --> 00:00:15.030
<v Speaker 1>if the first one is that we see politics</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a broad sense,</v>

7
00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:15.864
<v Speaker 1>and this means that we can talk about </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics without considering economic </v>

8
00:00:18.721 --> 00:00:19.554
<v Speaker 1>and social issues.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course I day I think we can deny the </v>

9
00:00:21.811 --> 00:00:24.600
<v Speaker 1>huge influence that big companies play </v>
<v Speaker 1>on our lives.</v>

10
00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.930
<v Speaker 2>Second</v>

11
00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.570
<v Speaker 1>only we know that many of you love these</v>
<v Speaker 1>kinds of videos.</v>

12
00:00:31.571 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>So we keep making them and you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

13
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.490
<v Speaker 1>we like these kinds of videos too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So here we are.</v>

14
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.070
<v Speaker 1>So in this video we're gonna have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty interesting combination.</v>

15
00:00:39.071 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>We've got the company of BMW and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries of Germany and China.</v>

16
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.063
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual holistic Germany is the mother </v>

17
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:55.004
<v Speaker 1>factory of the wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place where machines and the </v>

18
00:00:57.471 --> 00:01:00.140
<v Speaker 1>things that go into the other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>that other countries produce,</v>

19
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.090
<v Speaker 1>manufacture</v>

20
00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.923
<v Speaker 2>shit.</v>

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of the industries,</v>

22
00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:06.314
<v Speaker 1>the automobile industry is without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubt the most famous and also the most </v>

23
00:01:09.771 --> 00:01:12.260
<v Speaker 1>peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know that brands like Mercedes,</v>

24
00:01:12.261 --> 00:01:13.550
<v Speaker 1>BMW,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Volkswagen,</v>

25
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.460
<v Speaker 1>Porsche,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opal,</v>

26
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:15.294
<v Speaker 1>and Audi are all jokes because Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't any one of the largest copper </v>

27
00:01:21.701 --> 00:01:22.534
<v Speaker 1>producers in the wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is also considered the cradle of the </v>

28
00:01:24.711 --> 00:01:25.990
<v Speaker 1>first cop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

29
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.833
<v Speaker 1>you heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seen 85 a German engineer called Karl </v>

30
00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:35.890
<v Speaker 1>Benz trying to place a combustion engine</v>
<v Speaker 1>into a three wheels.</v>

31
00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:36.724
<v Speaker 1>Chariots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was known as the bend patent motor </v>

32
00:01:39.221 --> 00:01:40.054
<v Speaker 1>wagon atoms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was able to reach an astounding </v>

33
00:01:41.351 --> 00:01:43.350
<v Speaker 1>seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'd all 16 Colombo</v>

34
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.213
<v Speaker 2>does now</v>

35
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>25 units were manufactured and in one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

36
00:01:51.521 --> 00:01:54.040
<v Speaker 1>Bertha Benz,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cole's wife needs what is considered the</v>

37
00:01:54.041 --> 00:01:58.270
<v Speaker 1>first contract in history for a distance</v>
<v Speaker 1>of actually 94 kilometers,</v>

38
00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.100
<v Speaker 1>which isn't bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that something you might be thinking</v>

39
00:02:00.101 --> 00:02:01.220
<v Speaker 1>about right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's the,</v>

40
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 1>well back then the were no petrol </v>
<v Speaker 1>stations.</v>

41
00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.520
<v Speaker 1>So how exactly did Bertha Benz refuel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:06.521 --> 00:02:10.520
<v Speaker 1>she did this by buying a petroleum </v>
<v Speaker 1>derivative in pharmacies called AESOP.</v>

43
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:11.423
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say that pharmacies where the </v>

44
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:13.894
<v Speaker 1>first gas stations in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course that's not the reason why </v>

45
00:02:16.901 --> 00:02:19.570
<v Speaker 1>cars in Germany are quite so important.</v>

46
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.083
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

47
00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.630
<v Speaker 1>because more machines are always needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The automotive industry to viewer is one</v>

48
00:02:28.631 --> 00:02:32.170
<v Speaker 1>of the most productive and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalized so well what better place to</v>

49
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:35.530
<v Speaker 1>manufacture them than Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country of machines.</v>

50
00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:36.880
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>

51
00:02:36.881 --> 00:02:37.714
<v Speaker 1>let's just say that in recent times the </v>
<v Speaker 1>German automotive industry as the </v>

52
00:02:41.351 --> 00:02:42.184
<v Speaker 1>European automotive industry in general </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been the most popular danger of </v>

53
00:02:52.161 --> 00:02:52.994
<v Speaker 1>extinction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

54
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.953
<v Speaker 1>In recent times that has been a </v>
<v Speaker 1>widespread feeling that the traditional </v>

55
00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.550
<v Speaker 1>automotive industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially as we said,</v>

56
00:03:00.551 --> 00:03:01.384
<v Speaker 1>European manufacturers will be the big </v>
<v Speaker 1>losers of the upcoming electric car and </v>

57
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:06.850
<v Speaker 1>autonomous car revenue.</v>

58
00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.490
<v Speaker 2>You should</v>

59
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.540
<v Speaker 1>want one of those old companies when we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have fresh and innovative companies like</v>

60
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.403
<v Speaker 1>Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something we've actually </v>

61
00:03:21.671 --> 00:03:23.530
<v Speaker 1>talked about on this channel not so long</v>
<v Speaker 1>ago,</v>

62
00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.230
<v Speaker 1>despite never having made any money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>producing very few cars,</v>

63
00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.093
<v Speaker 1>tesla has a market value for it is as </v>
<v Speaker 1>large as that of BMW and which is far </v>

64
00:03:30.821 --> 00:03:33.640
<v Speaker 1>superior to companies such as Renno or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Persia.</v>

65
00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>So how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:37.541 --> 00:03:40.960
<v Speaker 1>as we saw basically because many </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors consider this in a few years,</v>

67
00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.660
<v Speaker 1>Tesla will literally take over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>

68
00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] the viewer is where </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions began to arise.</v>

69
00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:49.300
<v Speaker 1>We'll the electric car transition really</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that quick.</v>

70
00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:52.960
<v Speaker 1>A European manufacturer is too late to </v>
<v Speaker 1>join this resolution.</v>

71
00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:58.720
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know what you think,</v>

72
00:03:58.721 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>but some information at least does not </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem to support these ideas.</v>

73
00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>According to a recent study from the Ifo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute,</v>

74
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.203
<v Speaker 1>Europe owns almost half of all patents </v>
<v Speaker 1>related to the electric car leading the </v>

75
00:04:10.871 --> 00:04:14.140
<v Speaker 1>world ranking and being well ahead of </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries such as Japan,</v>

76
00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:17.680
<v Speaker 1>23% and the United States 18% Yvonne </v>
<v Speaker 1>Martin,</v>

77
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>president and Chief Investment Officer </v>
<v Speaker 1>of my Guyana's value</v>

78
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:26.610
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

79
00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.423
<v Speaker 1>Now let's assume that Elon musk is right</v>
<v Speaker 1>and tesla managers to overcome all of </v>

80
00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>the problems that currently affects it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

81
00:04:35.011 --> 00:04:35.844
<v Speaker 1>the production of the model three and </v>
<v Speaker 1>thus fulfills his most ambitious </v>

82
00:04:38.671 --> 00:04:43.050
<v Speaker 1>forecast managing to sell 2 million cars</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2022 this means that he would have to</v>

83
00:04:43.051 --> 00:04:43.884
<v Speaker 1>multiply his production capacity and not</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy two or by five but by 20 in just </v>

84
00:04:48.601 --> 00:04:49.434
<v Speaker 1>over four years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one in that same year at least 110 </v>

85
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.020
<v Speaker 1>million vehicles are expected to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>produced in the world.</v>

86
00:04:55.990 --> 00:05:00.990
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

87
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.630
<v Speaker 1>when we consider these strong growth of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle class in emerging markets,</v>

88
00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.750
<v Speaker 1>I would actually be on a far greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle production than that,</v>

89
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:10.570
<v Speaker 1>but let's just be prudent and stick with</v>
<v Speaker 1>that number.</v>

90
00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:11.463
<v Speaker 1>Out of those 110 million cost,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no more than 20% are expected to be </v>

91
00:05:14.501 --> 00:05:16.990
<v Speaker 1>electric cars or even just plug in </v>
<v Speaker 1>hybrids.</v>

92
00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:18.580
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:05:18.581 --> 00:05:19.414
<v Speaker 1>what it means is in the best case </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario for Tessa would have a market </v>

94
00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:26.670
<v Speaker 1>share in the industry of less than 2% </v>
<v Speaker 1>and 9% in the electric car</v>

95
00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:32.640
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

96
00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:38.453
<v Speaker 1>We can say that the cards that not even </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealt yet and so that even if Tesla's </v>

97
00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.423
<v Speaker 1>best forecasts on mass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we'll still be many companies in </v>

98
00:05:45.221 --> 00:05:47.140
<v Speaker 1>the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Companies such as BMW,</v>

99
00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.780
<v Speaker 2>he ended up here</v>

100
00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.810
<v Speaker 1>is one of the great icons in German </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

101
00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:03.100
<v Speaker 1>robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>luxurious,</v>

102
00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:06.040
<v Speaker 1>technologically advanced cars who </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't want to be honest.</v>

103
00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:06.923
<v Speaker 2>How about you?</v>

104
00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.693
<v Speaker 1>In line of the past 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brand has been the world's leader </v>

105
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.720
<v Speaker 1>in premium costs and the truth is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is pretty interesting.</v>

106
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 2>He,</v>

107
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.903
<v Speaker 1>this company besides owning bmw also </v>
<v Speaker 1>owns mini and Rolls Royce and at the </v>

108
00:06:25.391 --> 00:06:26.224
<v Speaker 1>time of publishing this video has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>market value that is very similar to </v>

109
00:06:28.481 --> 00:06:30.500
<v Speaker 1>that of Tesla at about 50 billion</v>

110
00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:32.293
<v Speaker 2>donuts.</v>

111
00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:35.990
<v Speaker 1>This both companies have many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many differences.</v>

112
00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:39.413
<v Speaker 1>While in 2016 Elon Musk's company </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to sell 76,000 cause while </v>

113
00:06:43.171 --> 00:06:44.004
<v Speaker 1>losing $770 million,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the German company sold 2.3 6 million </v>

114
00:06:47.941 --> 00:06:48.774
<v Speaker 1>calls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And how they profit after tax of more </v>

115
00:06:50.611 --> 00:06:52.620
<v Speaker 1>than $7 billion.</v>

116
00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:55.323
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now I know what many of you are </v>

118
00:06:56.081 --> 00:06:57.550
<v Speaker 1>probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a minute,</v>

119
00:06:57.551 --> 00:06:58.384
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this isn't a fair competition and Tesla </v>

120
00:06:59.681 --> 00:07:02.860
<v Speaker 1>is currently investing in research and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the developing new technologies.</v>

121
00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.650
<v Speaker 1>What BMW makes the same cause they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>been making forever.</v>

122
00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:08.420
<v Speaker 1>Well it isn't actually quite like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me explain.</v>

123
00:07:10.670 --> 00:07:11.503
<v Speaker 1>In 2016 for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gem and grief invested more than $5 </v>

124
00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:16.040
<v Speaker 1>billion in research and development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

125
00:07:16.041 --> 00:07:18.030
<v Speaker 1>tests,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his investment was funny of time,</v>

126
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.930
<v Speaker 1>smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly less than $1 billion.</v>

127
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.823
<v Speaker 1>And of course a lot of that BMW </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment money is going to developing </v>

128
00:07:24.810 --> 00:07:25.643
<v Speaker 1>electric and autonomous models w to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend $237 million on battery cell </v>

129
00:07:33.871 --> 00:07:35.610
<v Speaker 1>center.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's not all.</v>

130
00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.503
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so here's a question for you and please </v>

131
00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:39.720
<v Speaker 1>do not give a listen sheet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which company,</v>

132
00:07:39.721 --> 00:07:44.721
<v Speaker 1>BMW or Tesla do you think is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sell more electric cars in 2017 now,</v>

133
00:07:48.040 --> 00:07:51.970
<v Speaker 1>many of you are probably batting on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla right now by a lot,</v>

134
00:07:52.170 --> 00:07:53.003
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

135
00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:54.593
<v Speaker 1>Well wait just a second because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is that taking both electric cars </v>

136
00:07:57.271 --> 00:08:01.020
<v Speaker 1>and the plug in hybrids into accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both companies are actually very close.</v>

137
00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:01.913
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does look like Tesla is going to win </v>

138
00:08:03.241 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>this race with a few weeks left in 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's seriously close.</v>

139
00:08:07.620 --> 00:08:08.453
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both companies are expected to close </v>

140
00:08:09.571 --> 00:08:13.680
<v Speaker 1>2017 sales with approximately a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand electric cars.</v>

141
00:08:13.681 --> 00:08:14.491
<v Speaker 1>Salt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

142
00:08:14.491 --> 00:08:15.324
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I'm sure some of you are going to </v>

143
00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.760
<v Speaker 1>argue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Tesla has stored a lot of it's model</v>

144
00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:20.700
<v Speaker 1>three cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in principle translates into sales</v>

145
00:08:20.701 --> 00:08:21.534
<v Speaker 1>for the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Model three will be new territory for </v>

146
00:08:24.451 --> 00:08:27.270
<v Speaker 1>CEO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elon Musk and Tesla as a company.</v>

147
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.140
<v Speaker 1>The sedan has already received at least </v>
<v Speaker 1>400,000 preorders.</v>

148
00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:32.063
<v Speaker 1>That is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the German brand also hopes to </v>

149
00:08:34.441 --> 00:08:34.900
<v Speaker 1>improve it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

150
00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:39.900
<v Speaker 2>it's numbers in short,</v>
<v Speaker 2>short,</v>

151
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.630
<v Speaker 1>as we always say here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic.</v>

152
00:08:43.631 --> 00:08:46.410
<v Speaker 1>The future is by definition I'm Satin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tesla.</v>

153
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:49.270
<v Speaker 1>It could be a great company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not going to be the only one.</v>

154
00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Speaker 1>The truth is the by selling almost as </v>
<v Speaker 1>many electric cars is Tesla by investing</v>

155
00:08:53.021 --> 00:08:53.854
<v Speaker 1>five times more in r and d and by owning</v>
<v Speaker 1>a cumulative profit of more than $30 </v>

156
00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:58.583
<v Speaker 1>billion in the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we can say that BMW is at least </v>

157
00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:05.730
<v Speaker 1>a very important competitor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

158
00:09:05.760 --> 00:09:06.593
<v Speaker 1>it is surprising that both company's </v>
<v Speaker 1>market value is practically the same </v>

159
00:09:09.151 --> 00:09:13.230
<v Speaker 1>considering that expectations for one so</v>
<v Speaker 1>much higher than they offer the other.</v>

160
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>This is especially when we consider that</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>

161
00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:20.190
<v Speaker 1>BMW has become a major and very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important player in the Chinese market.</v>

162
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:25.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

163
00:09:25.990 --> 00:09:27.400
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese market</v>

164
00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:30.100
<v Speaker 2>since</v>

165
00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:33.580
<v Speaker 1>2007 and despite the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic crisis,</v>

166
00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:34.443
<v Speaker 1>the BMW group has managed in less than </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years to increase the number of cars </v>

167
00:09:37.691 --> 00:09:42.691
<v Speaker 1>it's making from 1.5 million in 2007 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>2.3 7 million in 2016 and of course that</v>

168
00:09:44.531 --> 00:09:47.410
<v Speaker 1>translates into more income and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>mop.</v>

169
00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:55.183
<v Speaker 1>BMW is nets benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the money that's left for the </v>

170
00:09:57.121 --> 00:10:00.780
<v Speaker 1>company after taxes has more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>doubled in this period of time.</v>

171
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:05.900
<v Speaker 1>Check out this graph,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that graph,</v>

172
00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:09.860
<v Speaker 1>we could see that things have gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather wealthy</v>

173
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.003
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>

174
00:10:14.940 --> 00:10:19.230
<v Speaker 1>One of the pieces that has greatly aided</v>
<v Speaker 1>this progress is actually China.</v>

175
00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:20.123
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at how the market has it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then 16 I managed to sell half a </v>

176
00:10:28.080 --> 00:10:28.913
<v Speaker 1>million cars out of which 300 thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>were manufactured in China itself </v>

177
00:10:32.281 --> 00:10:36.180
<v Speaker 1>through a partnership with a local </v>
<v Speaker 1>company and 200,000 were importers,</v>

178
00:10:36.210 --> 00:10:38.730
<v Speaker 1>mostly from factories that the company </v>
<v Speaker 1>has in Germany.</v>

179
00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:43.483
<v Speaker 2>Other way</v>

180
00:10:44.400 --> 00:10:48.630
<v Speaker 1>it's one out of every four cars sold by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the BMW group is already in China.</v>

181
00:10:48.710 --> 00:10:49.543
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>markets where the automobile out will </v>

182
00:10:50.671 --> 00:10:53.490
<v Speaker 1>surge in the upcoming years along with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its middle class.</v>

183
00:10:55.290 --> 00:10:56.070
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is the,</v>

184
00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.903
<v Speaker 1>beyond any comparison with Tesla,</v>
<v Speaker 1>BMW is Chinese adventure shows us a </v>

185
00:11:00.181 --> 00:11:01.014
<v Speaker 1>couple of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first is that far from what is </v>

186
00:11:02.491 --> 00:11:03.324
<v Speaker 1>usually said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China could be a great source of </v>

187
00:11:04.711 --> 00:11:05.544
<v Speaker 1>opportunities and wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's something which incidentally we've </v>

188
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:09.300
<v Speaker 1>been mentioning all the visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>for quite a lot</v>

189
00:11:09.390 --> 00:11:12.490
<v Speaker 2>time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

190
00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.500
<v Speaker 1>18 million Chinese people join the </v>
<v Speaker 1>middle class and this has very clear,</v>

191
00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>obvious consequences on their ability to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish.</v>

192
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is very common to hear politicians of</v>

193
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:24.750
<v Speaker 1>all backgrounds arguing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to export more,</v>

194
00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:27.300
<v Speaker 1>the currency needs to be devalued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

195
00:11:27.330 --> 00:11:29.100
<v Speaker 1>Germany in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they say quite the opposite.</v>

196
00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:33.590
<v Speaker 1>What is required isn't a cheap currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's competitiveness and a good product.</v>

197
00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:38.440
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

198
00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:39.273
<v Speaker 1>That is something we are going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about another time and now it's your </v>

199
00:11:41.981 --> 00:11:42.814
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have to choose which company </v>

200
00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.673
<v Speaker 1>would you bet on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would it be tesla or would it be bmw at </v>

201
00:11:46.721 --> 00:11:47.554
<v Speaker 1>the end of the day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we've seen both having very similar </v>

202
00:11:49.391 --> 00:11:50.224
<v Speaker 1>market value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So please do leave your answer in the </v>

203
00:11:52.151 --> 00:11:56.830
