1
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:08.753
<v Speaker 1>Located in the Persian Gulf because </v>
<v Speaker 1>Howard is a country with an area of a </v>

2
00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.990
<v Speaker 1>little more than 10,000 square </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers,</v>

3
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.690
<v Speaker 1>just to give you some idea of just how </v>
<v Speaker 1>small that is.</v>

4
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:16.793
<v Speaker 1>Nearly 40 times smaller than California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so when this country got its </v>

5
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:24.540
<v Speaker 1>independence from the UK in Nineteen 71 </v>
<v Speaker 1>guitar was a faraway,</v>

6
00:00:24.541 --> 00:00:27.600
<v Speaker 1>hostile and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor place.</v>

7
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.750
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was one of the poorest territories of</v>

8
00:00:30.751 --> 00:00:34.230
<v Speaker 1>the United Kingdom and well that kind of</v>
<v Speaker 1>made a lot of sense.</v>

9
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:35.123
<v Speaker 1>The Guitar Peninsula is a place where </v>
<v Speaker 1>temperatures can reach 50 degrees </v>

10
00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:40.680
<v Speaker 1>Celsius in summer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost completely covered by desert</v>

11
00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:44.130
<v Speaker 1>and it was certainly one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninhabitable places on earth,</v>

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:44.993
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't stay that way forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And today guitar is the richest country </v>

13
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.920
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

14
00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:52.350
<v Speaker 1>that's right to the citizens of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny nation.</v>

15
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:57.351
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy a per capita income of more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>$125,000,</v>

16
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.260
<v Speaker 1>which is almost three times the income </v>
<v Speaker 1>in France.</v>

17
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.930
<v Speaker 1>And to follow your time is that found in</v>

18
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:02.903
<v Speaker 2>really.</v>

19
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.610
<v Speaker 1>This is a country which was almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>uninhabited.</v>

20
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.850
<v Speaker 1>A country third could hardly survive on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's fishing industry,</v>

21
00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.120
<v Speaker 1>and today it looks something like </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrooge mcduck safe</v>

22
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:25.253
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government investments and properties </v>

23
00:01:26.641 --> 00:01:29.350
<v Speaker 1>all around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the birthplace of Alpha zero,</v>

24
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.360
<v Speaker 1>the most important Arabic media company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well then there was Doha,</v>

25
00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.283
<v Speaker 1>the capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a sea of skyscrapers and </v>

26
00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:40.560
<v Speaker 1>luxurious cars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a mix of Monaco in vegas,</v>

27
00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:43.530
<v Speaker 1>but without the alcohol and gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no room for simplicity.</v>

28
00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.513
<v Speaker 1>Everything is sumptuous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge and sparkling in Doha on how </v>

29
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.853
<v Speaker 1>Sausalito conflict areas reporter gets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has gone from being a dark shelter for </v>

30
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:53.310
<v Speaker 1>what harvest preachers and has become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch.</v>

31
00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:56.790
<v Speaker 1>People might consider the most open </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in the Middle East.</v>

32
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.550
<v Speaker 1>This is of course excluding Dubai birds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might know,</v>

33
00:01:59.551 --> 00:02:04.551
<v Speaker 1>Dubai is an emirate and not actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country something Doha.</v>

34
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.640
<v Speaker 1>We can find international universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>or the Falls Church city,</v>

35
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.410
<v Speaker 1>a complex of Protestant Orthodox and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Catholic churches like the Church of our</v>

36
00:02:15.411 --> 00:02:19.580
<v Speaker 1>lady rosary million dollar Catholic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Church,</v>

37
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.443
<v Speaker 1>which seats 2,700 is located in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>southern outskirts of the city on land </v>

38
00:02:24.681 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>donated by seek Hamad bin Khalifa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Funny Qatar's emir.</v>

39
00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.683
<v Speaker 1>So now the question of course has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>how did Qatar achieve this remarkable </v>

40
00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:34.670
<v Speaker 1>transformation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

41
00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:35.533
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at</v>

42
00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.090
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

43
00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.960
<v Speaker 1>LNG blessing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>liquefied natural gas.</v>

44
00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.933
<v Speaker 1>In other videos we have discussed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>keys as to why some countries are so </v>

45
00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:46.964
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this case it is much simpler and </v>

46
00:02:49.011 --> 00:02:51.500
<v Speaker 1>it can be summarized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blink two things.</v>

47
00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.820
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bands.</v>

48
00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:55.160
<v Speaker 1>More importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas,</v>

49
00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.340
<v Speaker 1>a massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>massive amounts of natural gas.</v>

50
00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:59.573
<v Speaker 1>That really is pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you'll just voice it will just hold </v>

51
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 1>on a second because it's actually quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>an interesting story</v>

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.273
<v Speaker 2>already.</v>

53
00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.590
<v Speaker 1>The fields they were found in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>forties and by the 19 sixties,</v>

54
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.453
<v Speaker 1>exploitation was already consolidators </v>
<v Speaker 1>and things in the poor country of Qatar </v>

55
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.180
<v Speaker 1>changed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not really that much.</v>

56
00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:21.810
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that it wasn't until the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 19 seventies that shell</v>

57
00:03:21.811 --> 00:03:22.644
<v Speaker 1>founds the biggest treasure of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and that would be the north </v>

58
00:03:25.931 --> 00:03:26.764
<v Speaker 1>fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the largest gas field in the </v>

59
00:03:28.921 --> 00:03:29.754
<v Speaker 1>world</v>

60
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.760
<v Speaker 1>at that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

61
00:03:34.761 --> 00:03:37.130
<v Speaker 1>natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it just wasn't that profitable.</v>

62
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.060
<v Speaker 1>You see at the time gasket only be </v>
<v Speaker 1>transported through gas pipes and guitar</v>

63
00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.940
<v Speaker 1>was far from places where this gas could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be used.</v>

64
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.200
<v Speaker 1>Even Shell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

65
00:03:45.201 --> 00:03:46.034
<v Speaker 1>they soon forgot about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well things they were really about </v>

66
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:51.590
<v Speaker 1>to change in 1996,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the older male,</v>

67
00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.360
<v Speaker 1>bin Khalifa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>al tiny,</v>

68
00:03:53.361 --> 00:03:58.220
<v Speaker 1>who abdicated in 2013 staged acute atar </v>
<v Speaker 1>while his father was in Switzerland.</v>

69
00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.250
<v Speaker 1>This Amir reached our with a clear idea </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was the future of guitar was in</v>

70
00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:04.243
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply had to exploit their huge </v>

71
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.720
<v Speaker 1>gasfields man so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did just that.</v>

72
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.560
<v Speaker 1>The new mayor decided to invest in an </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeveloped Andrew rare technology.</v>

73
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:14.390
<v Speaker 1>This technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's liquefaction,</v>

74
00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>which is the ability to carry natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas in its liquid form so that it can be</v>

75
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:21.050
<v Speaker 1>transported in large ships as if it was </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil.</v>

76
00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.913
<v Speaker 1>In order to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas needed to cool down and be kept </v>

77
00:04:23.841 --> 00:04:26.990
<v Speaker 1>at a temperature of minus 161 degrees </v>
<v Speaker 1>Celsius,</v>

78
00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.853
<v Speaker 1>which is minus 258 degrees Fahrenheit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this is something that is pretty </v>

79
00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:32.830
<v Speaker 1>inconvenient to do</v>

80
00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:37.983
<v Speaker 1>so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I could tell they decided to invest </v>

81
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:39.803
<v Speaker 1>enormous quantities of resources in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to boost the development of this </v>

82
00:04:42.471 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 1>technology so that it can be used on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive scale.</v>

83
00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:46.543
<v Speaker 1>Because of that as investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guitar is now the world's largest </v>

84
00:04:48.711 --> 00:04:50.970
<v Speaker 1>exporter of LNG.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With this technology,</v>

85
00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.620
<v Speaker 1>guitar is able to export its enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas supplies to the rest of the world.</v>

86
00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:55.670
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

87
00:04:55.671 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 1>three quarters of guitars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gas went to Asian countries like China,</v>

88
00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.870
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea,</v>

89
00:04:59.871 --> 00:05:00.704
<v Speaker 1>and Japan as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's more because the industrial </v>

90
00:05:02.451 --> 00:05:04.820
<v Speaker 1>complex that guitar has developed is so </v>
<v Speaker 1>big,</v>

91
00:05:04.821 --> 00:05:05.654
<v Speaker 1>so large scale that the country has </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to have the cheapest costs of </v>

92
00:05:09.051 --> 00:05:12.440
<v Speaker 1>extraction and liquefaction in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>

93
00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:14.400
<v Speaker 1>To illustrate this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 10 career,</v>

94
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:15.243
<v Speaker 1>LNG is four times cheaper and guitar </v>
<v Speaker 1>than it is in the United States and </v>

95
00:05:20.421 --> 00:05:21.560
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:05:21.561 --> 00:05:24.440
<v Speaker 1>that's the secret of this small and </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy country.</v>

97
00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:25.363
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

98
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.110
<v Speaker 1>there's only a part of the equation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

99
00:05:27.140 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>not only does the country have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploit the resources they have,</v>

100
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.430
<v Speaker 1>but they also need to use that money to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate other money or they're going to</v>

101
00:05:34.431 --> 00:05:38.600
<v Speaker 1>end up like Angola or Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So besides this innovative process,</v>

102
00:05:38.601 --> 00:05:41.030
<v Speaker 1>guitar has some other keys to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>success,</v>

103
00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:47.903
<v Speaker 1>star power,</v>

104
00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:51.260
<v Speaker 2>some</v>

105
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.210
<v Speaker 1>odd bin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kalief Jatani reached power in 1995.</v>

106
00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.133
<v Speaker 1>Things they have changed significantly </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is 18 years leading the country </v>

107
00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.243
<v Speaker 1>Qatar's population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's multiplied by while at the same </v>

108
00:06:01.761 --> 00:06:04.190
<v Speaker 1>time it's become the richest country on </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

109
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.133
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

110
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>the older mayor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's got plenty of reasons to feel proud</v>

111
00:06:10.821 --> 00:06:11.654
<v Speaker 1>of himself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's move on from this because it </v>

112
00:06:13.791 --> 00:06:17.540
<v Speaker 1>started to generate a lot of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources and the question now is,</v>

113
00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:19.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what are they doing with this money well</v>

114
00:06:19.681 --> 00:06:20.514
<v Speaker 1>spent would it may look like they've </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually mostly invested it both </v>

115
00:06:23.180 --> 00:06:25.490
<v Speaker 1>nationally and internationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's hard.</v>

116
00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:28.700
<v Speaker 1>They've created the Qatar Investment </v>
<v Speaker 1>Authority,</v>

117
00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:32.570
<v Speaker 1>which is a huge funds to invest money </v>
<v Speaker 1>all around the world.</v>

118
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.463
<v Speaker 1>It is known as guitars power because </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have in their hands more than </v>

119
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.733
<v Speaker 1>$330,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And when you consider that the </v>

120
00:06:39.891 --> 00:06:42.890
<v Speaker 1>population of guitar is less than 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people,</v>

121
00:06:42.891 --> 00:06:46.870
<v Speaker 1>but if those 3 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only 300,000 citizens,</v>

122
00:06:46.910 --> 00:06:49.670
<v Speaker 1>well you can do the math.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fund,</v>

123
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:53.060
<v Speaker 1>it has made significant real estate </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments all over the world.</v>

124
00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.040
<v Speaker 1>A big part of the city belongs to Qatar </v>
<v Speaker 1>and including offices,</v>

125
00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:01.760
<v Speaker 1>hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apartments and swell.</v>

126
00:07:01.761 --> 00:07:04.630
<v Speaker 1>In the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guitar was in 2016.</v>

127
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.310
<v Speaker 1>The fourth largest office investor in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country in Manhattan alone.</v>

128
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:10.173
<v Speaker 1>This fund is invested $5,000,000,000 in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last two years and they're not just </v>

129
00:07:13.751 --> 00:07:17.350
<v Speaker 1>investing in real estate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This funds also has major shares in many</v>

130
00:07:17.351 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>multinationals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It gets on this,</v>

131
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:19.863
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest shareholders of </v>

132
00:07:21.251 --> 00:07:23.530
<v Speaker 1>companies like Volkswagen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iberdrola,</v>

133
00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Barclays Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tiffany and co Shell,</v>

134
00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:26.673
<v Speaker 1>or even the judge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rough snaps the oil company of the </v>

135
00:07:28.571 --> 00:07:30.850
<v Speaker 1>Russian governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the image I'm about to show you,</v>

136
00:07:30.851 --> 00:07:31.684
<v Speaker 1>you can see how much foreign investment </v>
<v Speaker 1>has increased as the production of gas </v>

137
00:07:34.571 --> 00:07:35.710
<v Speaker 1>and oil has grown</v>

138
00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.220
<v Speaker 2>pants.</v>

139
00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:41.620
<v Speaker 1>It's not just international investments </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

140
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:45.040
<v Speaker 1>They're also investing lots of resources</v>
<v Speaker 1>inside the country.</v>

141
00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Tens of billions has been spent on </v>
<v Speaker 1>highways,</v>

142
00:07:47.771 --> 00:07:48.850
<v Speaker 1>ports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airports,</v>

143
00:07:48.851 --> 00:07:50.890
<v Speaker 1>research centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financial centers,</v>

144
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:53.960
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might bE asking now,</v>

145
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.930
<v Speaker 1>what's the goal of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:07:55.931 --> 00:07:56.764
<v Speaker 1>that is to be able to in the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replace the income they get from island </v>

147
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:00.454
<v Speaker 1>gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with income from all of these </v>

148
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:02.734
<v Speaker 1>investments versus you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment when the gas business runs </v>

149
00:08:04.961 --> 00:08:07.520
<v Speaker 1>out is still too far away to really be a</v>
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

150
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.650
<v Speaker 1>No analysts who can say when demand for </v>
<v Speaker 1>gas,</v>

151
00:08:11.651 --> 00:08:12.484
<v Speaker 1>we'll wait for oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are people who See peak demand </v>

152
00:08:14.111 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 1>demanded 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 others in 20,</v>

153
00:08:15.971 --> 00:08:16.804
<v Speaker 1>42,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for gas demand is constantly </v>

154
00:08:18.731 --> 00:08:19.564
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This idea they have of investing rather </v>

155
00:08:21.011 --> 00:08:21.844
<v Speaker 1>than spending the money from natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources might be at one of the most </v>

156
00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:25.264
<v Speaker 1>important differences between Qatar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries who are also rich in </v>

157
00:08:29.081 --> 00:08:30.880
<v Speaker 1>natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of them,</v>

158
00:08:30.881 --> 00:08:32.500
<v Speaker 1>they find it too easy to spend the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

159
00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:33.334
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man's not think too much about the </v>

160
00:08:34.841 --> 00:08:39.841
<v Speaker 1>future effective independent</v>

161
00:08:43.860 --> 00:08:44.290
<v Speaker 2>when someones</v>

162
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:48.120
<v Speaker 1>been kelly for our tiny reached power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He also had another thing in mind,</v>

163
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Qatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had to gain international influence.</v>

164
00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:52.230
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>

165
00:08:52.231 --> 00:08:54.240
<v Speaker 1>guitar was controlled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A de facto bike.</v>

166
00:08:54.241 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>Saudi arabia under the new amir just </v>
<v Speaker 1>couldn't forget about iraq's invasion of</v>

167
00:08:58.801 --> 00:09:01.020
<v Speaker 1>Kuwait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If gasol wanted to survive,</v>

168
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:05.130
<v Speaker 1>they needed to claim their identity and </v>
<v Speaker 1>gain international influence.</v>

169
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.113
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise any conflict with radar could </v>
<v Speaker 1>compromise the independence of the </v>

170
00:09:09.031 --> 00:09:12.600
<v Speaker 1>country besides well natural gas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could pay the bills now,</v>

171
00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:18.690
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

172
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:23.690
<v Speaker 1>in 2003 when Saudi Arabia or requested </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the u s take american troops out of</v>

173
00:09:23.851 --> 00:09:24.684
<v Speaker 1>that country guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't hesitate to offer itself as a </v>

174
00:09:27.391 --> 00:09:28.224
<v Speaker 1>destination for those trips.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't even blink when it came to </v>

175
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:35.400
<v Speaker 1>spending about $8,000,000,000 to build </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military bases that were needed.</v>

176
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:36.353
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

177
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:41.473
<v Speaker 1>brawling based 20 miles southwest of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>qatari capital of doha is home to some </v>

178
00:09:44.811 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>11,000 us military personnel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

179
00:09:47.481 --> 00:09:48.314
<v Speaker 1>it could be said that Qatar has taken </v>
<v Speaker 1>out a very comprehensive insurance </v>

180
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.620
<v Speaker 1>policy and then we have the founding of </v>
<v Speaker 1>al jazeera.</v>

181
00:09:54.680 --> 00:09:58.410
<v Speaker 1>this has the objective of obtaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>global influence bands.</v>

182
00:09:58.411 --> 00:09:59.244
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they succeeded and this is something we </v>

183
00:10:00.201 --> 00:10:03.470
<v Speaker 1>actually covered in a previous video </v>
<v Speaker 1>that you should definitely check out.</v>

184
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:07.790
<v Speaker 1>They also developed a foreign policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>driving towards international influence</v>

185
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:12.803
<v Speaker 4>blockade.</v>

186
00:10:14.440 --> 00:10:15.273
<v Speaker 1>All this political strategy made both </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United Arab Emirates and Saudi </v>

187
00:10:18.760 --> 00:10:23.760
<v Speaker 1>Arabia very angry and in june of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they announced a blockade accusing Qatar</v>

188
00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:27.010
<v Speaker 1>of supporting fundamentalist groups and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorists,</v>

189
00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:27.903
<v Speaker 1>and when it comes to Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could definitely call this a case of </v>

190
00:10:30.791 --> 00:10:33.640
<v Speaker 1>the pot calling the kettle black.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

191
00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:36.070
<v Speaker 1>it is true that Qatar has some dark </v>
<v Speaker 1>secrets.</v>

192
00:10:36.071 --> 00:10:38.050
<v Speaker 1>I mean it is an absolute monarchy after </v>
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>

193
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.600
<v Speaker 1>but the country is a good ally for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>west,</v>

194
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:41.463
<v Speaker 1>especially the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's also one of the most open </v>

195
00:10:43.661 --> 00:10:46.150
<v Speaker 1>countries in the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that the boycotts,</v>

196
00:10:46.210 --> 00:10:48.570
<v Speaker 1>it had a different target to cut down </v>
<v Speaker 1>guitars,</v>

197
00:10:48.571 --> 00:10:52.650
<v Speaker 1>strategy of international influence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to essentially put them back in that</v>

198
00:10:52.651 --> 00:10:53.620
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

199
00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:54.790
<v Speaker 1>the blockade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

200
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.653
<v Speaker 1>it's been a total failure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First results position is not that </v>

201
00:10:58.331 --> 00:11:00.400
<v Speaker 1>strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very few countries have supported us,</v>

202
00:11:00.520 --> 00:11:02.710
<v Speaker 1>not even Kuwait or in mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

203
00:11:02.740 --> 00:11:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Qatar has developed to better </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationships with Turkey bands.</v>

204
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:06.663
<v Speaker 1>Even Iran console has simply proved that</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are strong enough to weather the </v>

205
00:11:09.941 --> 00:11:10.774
<v Speaker 1>storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And finally it's really important that </v>

206
00:11:12.371 --> 00:11:13.204
<v Speaker 1>we didn't make something clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There aren't plenty of gray areas in </v>

207
00:11:15.671 --> 00:11:16.504
<v Speaker 1>Qatar labor conditions that are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent with the ones of have a poor </v>

208
00:11:19.211 --> 00:11:20.044
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation of women in the country </v>

209
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.490
<v Speaker 1>and the lack of a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>

210
00:11:24.491 --> 00:11:25.324
<v Speaker 1>the system needs to prove that it can </v>
<v Speaker 1>work without the government because </v>

211
00:11:27.221 --> 00:11:28.054
<v Speaker 1>unlike dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the lead has been taken by public </v>

212
00:11:30.071 --> 00:11:31.720
<v Speaker 1>initiative,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not private,</v>

213
00:11:31.810 --> 00:11:32.643
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the reasons why dubai</v>
<v Speaker 1>is still above khatami in pretty much </v>

214
00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:37.450
<v Speaker 1>all aspects,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I am.</v>

215
00:11:37.451 --> 00:11:40.210
<v Speaker 1>And it would it be fair to not </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledge what they're doing right,</v>

216
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:43.420
<v Speaker 1>like they're saving capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That productive investments,</v>

217
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:44.710
<v Speaker 1>um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is there openness?</v>

218
00:11:44.770 --> 00:11:45.603
<v Speaker 1>And While that's our opinion here at </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic and now we would love to </v>

219
00:11:47.831 --> 00:11:48.664
<v Speaker 1>know what you think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who do you think will win the battle of </v>

220
00:11:50.801 --> 00:11:52.930
<v Speaker 1>the countries in the persian gulf,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saudi,</v>

221
00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:55.120
<v Speaker 1>or maybe Qatar?</v>
