00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>anyone had a faker,</v>

2
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>sk telecom fans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.480
<v Speaker 1>those over 30 the slightest clue what </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about.</v>

4
00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about some of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous players after the eeg of legends,</v>

5
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.290
<v Speaker 1>League of legends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as lol,</v>

6
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.133
<v Speaker 1>due to its initials,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the most successful video </v>

7
00:00:24.181 --> 00:00:25.620
<v Speaker 1>games in the world.</v>

8
00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

9
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:30.813
<v Speaker 1>How'd that rise?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many may think the video games aren't </v>

10
00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.003
<v Speaker 1>simply a domestic form of entertainment </v>
<v Speaker 1>with either game we'd play as is home </v>

11
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.660
<v Speaker 1>alone or with our friends and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much it writes well,</v>

12
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Dev view out nothing could be further </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the truth.</v>

13
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.413
<v Speaker 1>The surgeon will open its first use </v>
<v Speaker 1>sports stadium in Los Angeles next </v>

14
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 1>month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

15
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 1>That is really something that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening nowadays.</v>

16
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:56.504
<v Speaker 1>Video Games have become a mass sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost on the same level as football or </v>

17
00:01:00.651 --> 00:01:04.340
<v Speaker 1>formula one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>giving you an idea only in 2017.</v>

18
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:09.110
<v Speaker 1>East sports that is electronic sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>moved more than one point $5,000,000,000</v>

19
00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>through sponsorships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>merchandising and investment.</v>

20
00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.913
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is still a little compared to </v>

21
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>the $8,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Formula One moves,</v>

22
00:01:20.101 --> 00:01:20.934
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't bad if we consider that </v>

23
00:01:22.471 --> 00:01:26.040
<v Speaker 1>this new mass sport isn't even 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

24
00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.053
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first league of Legends World </v>

25
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.050
<v Speaker 1>Championship was held in 2011 and had an</v>
<v Speaker 1>audience of about $200,000.</v>

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.680
<v Speaker 1>Seven years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2016,</v>

27
00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.310
<v Speaker 1>more than 14 million people from around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world saw the final match.</v>

28
00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.970
<v Speaker 1>These figures are only a little bit </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower than the ones we could find for an</v>

29
00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.920
<v Speaker 1>NBA final,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not much lower.</v>

30
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:51.463
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>league of legends broadcast even have </v>

31
00:01:52.351 --> 00:01:54.590
<v Speaker 1>their own commentators in various </v>
<v Speaker 1>languages.</v>

32
00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.500
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think sports are the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular?</v>

33
00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:01.310
<v Speaker 1>Of course that would be an Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In countries like China or South Korea,</v>

34
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>their accounts for more than 60 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>of video games audience,</v>

35
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.233
<v Speaker 1>unlike Formula One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which never really took hold in this </v>

36
00:02:06.531 --> 00:02:07.364
<v Speaker 1>part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>East sports have really stuck and </v>

37
00:02:09.711 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>logically this has led to an uproar in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the investor as well.</v>

38
00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:19.643
<v Speaker 1>Intel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>HP announced record investment e-sports </v>

39
00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.831
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

40
00:02:22.831 --> 00:02:26.340
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and new technologies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>always been the perfect breeding grounds</v>

41
00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.300
<v Speaker 1>for generating financial bubbles that </v>
<v Speaker 1>explode in a rather big way.</v>

42
00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.780
<v Speaker 1>We've all heard about the.com crisis at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of the 21st century or the</v>

43
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.310
<v Speaker 1>downtown companies like snapchat took.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>

44
00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.263
<v Speaker 1>are we really talking about a new sport </v>
<v Speaker 1>or is this simply just another bubble </v>

45
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.730
<v Speaker 1>kind of massport simply be created from </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing just by investing money?</v>

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to answer these questions in</v>

47
00:02:49.501 --> 00:02:51.000
<v Speaker 1>today's video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>

48
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.290
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the history.</v>

49
00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.990
<v Speaker 2>Who invented</v>

50
00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.210
<v Speaker 1>Formula One in 2015 group of investors </v>
<v Speaker 1>go to liberty media,</v>

51
00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.160
<v Speaker 1>but what Formula One you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>wondering,</v>

52
00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can someone buy a sport?</v>

53
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that Formula One,</v>

54
00:03:07.391 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>in addition to being a sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

55
00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>is also actually a after the second </v>
<v Speaker 1>world war with the cars democratization,</v>

56
00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.690
<v Speaker 1>a massive public emerged who loved </v>
<v Speaker 1>seeing the fastest cars in the world and</v>

57
00:03:21.691 --> 00:03:22.524
<v Speaker 1>his car manufacturers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were happy to participate in these </v>

58
00:03:23.931 --> 00:03:24.764
<v Speaker 1>races.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Competitions gave them the perfect </v>

59
00:03:26.421 --> 00:03:30.050
<v Speaker 1>excuse to test their latest engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea of this formula,</v>

60
00:03:30.051 --> 00:03:30.884
<v Speaker 1>one car can cost millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it's never intended for the </v>

61
00:03:33.801 --> 00:03:35.300
<v Speaker 1>consumer markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

62
00:03:35.301 --> 00:03:39.830
<v Speaker 1>the technology it uses ends up being </v>
<v Speaker 1>implemented in utilitarian cars,</v>

63
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.160
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>disc brakes,</v>

64
00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:46.161
<v Speaker 1>so active suspension innovations born in</v>
<v Speaker 1>formula throughout these years.</v>

65
00:03:49.341 --> 00:03:50.174
<v Speaker 1>The only instate in job regulating and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stick teasing the competition rules was </v>

66
00:03:54.141 --> 00:03:58.060
<v Speaker 1>the international automobile federation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as the eye.</v>

67
00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:59.743
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real business didn't emerge until </v>

68
00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:05.951
<v Speaker 1>the seventies when this guy came along.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Bernie ecclestone something.</v>

69
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:14.060
<v Speaker 1>If the tuner of speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I Colston was the owner of a Formula One</v>

70
00:04:14.061 --> 00:04:14.894
<v Speaker 1>team.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He immediately realized that this sport </v>

71
00:04:16.071 --> 00:04:16.904
<v Speaker 1>was a money making machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the business was neither in the </v>

72
00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:22.370
<v Speaker 1>prizes nor in the car companies.</v>

73
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>The real money was in selling tv </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission rights around the wells.</v>

74
00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think Bernie did?</v>

75
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:31.750
<v Speaker 1>Hip well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he partnered with the other teams,</v>

76
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.673
<v Speaker 1>went to the IAF headquarters and told </v>
<v Speaker 1>them either you give us transmission </v>

77
00:04:35.591 --> 00:04:40.120
<v Speaker 1>rights so that we can manage them well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We stopped running and your out of races</v>

78
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>and that is how what we know today as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Formula One group was born.</v>

79
00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:47.563
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a sport that became the company </v>

80
00:04:49.131 --> 00:04:52.040
<v Speaker 1>that is even listed on the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Stock Exchange.</v>

81
00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.830
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand we have the IAF which is</v>

82
00:04:54.831 --> 00:04:55.664
<v Speaker 1>in charge of organizing the racism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creating the regulations so that </v>

83
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>everyone can meet on equal terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was on the other hands,</v>

84
00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.840
<v Speaker 1>the one who really has all the money as </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Formula One group,</v>

85
00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and we're not just talking about a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars here and 2011.</v>

86
00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.580
<v Speaker 1>They made a profit of over one point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000,000.</v>

87
00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:13.690
<v Speaker 2>Hmm.</v>

88
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:15.270
<v Speaker 1>And when we talk about billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

89
00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to get lost in the figures and</v>

90
00:05:16.981 --> 00:05:19.200
<v Speaker 1>not really know how much that is worth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but put it this way,</v>

91
00:05:19.201 --> 00:05:20.034
<v Speaker 1>the Burj Khalifa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tallest building in the world could </v>

92
00:05:21.451 --> 00:05:23.250
<v Speaker 1>be built with that kind of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

93
00:05:23.251 --> 00:05:24.084
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two organizations that often </v>

94
00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.150
<v Speaker 1>fighting and they do have a lot of legal</v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts because they will.</v>

95
00:05:29.151 --> 00:05:30.210
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

96
00:05:30.211 --> 00:05:31.044
<v Speaker 1>how does Formula One make any money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now pay attention here because this is </v>

97
00:05:34.261 --> 00:05:36.510
<v Speaker 1>going to help us analyze e-sports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>veteran a moments.</v>

98
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.523
<v Speaker 1>Most of the money comes from </v>
<v Speaker 1>transmission rights and from the </v>

99
00:05:39.331 --> 00:05:40.164
<v Speaker 1>payments that municipalities and </v>
<v Speaker 1>different governments make to host any </v>

100
00:05:42.631 --> 00:05:43.464
<v Speaker 1>of the races in that cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those two things alone account for 60 </v>

101
00:05:47.581 --> 00:05:48.414
<v Speaker 1>percent of the income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rest is made with companies </v>

102
00:05:50.391 --> 00:05:51.224
<v Speaker 1>sponsorships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is advertising and merchandise </v>

103
00:05:53.071 --> 00:05:57.070
<v Speaker 1>sales and so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the too long didn't read version is yes,</v>

104
00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.100
<v Speaker 1>the company can create a big sport and </v>
<v Speaker 1>make billions of dollars from it,</v>

105
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.950
<v Speaker 1>from essentially nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question is,</v>

106
00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>can e-sports replicate this business </v>
<v Speaker 1>model?</v>

107
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's dive into that right now.</v>

108
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:14.840
<v Speaker 1>Pixels to legends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just like car racing,</v>

109
00:06:14.841 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>video game competitions are as old as </v>
<v Speaker 1>video games themselves.</v>

110
00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.430
<v Speaker 1>The first major tournament was held in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1972 at Stanford University.</v>

111
00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:28.730
<v Speaker 1>More than 10,000 people gathered to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best space wall players.</v>

112
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.220
<v Speaker 1>It's baseball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was one of these old video games with</v>

113
00:06:31.221 --> 00:06:36.221
<v Speaker 1>big pixels and eight bit music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In those years.</v>

114
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.670
<v Speaker 1>Video Games hardly had multiplayer </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems and internet connections that he</v>

115
00:06:39.671 --> 00:06:41.120
<v Speaker 1>existed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>

116
00:06:41.121 --> 00:06:43.820
<v Speaker 1>in those times it was very haunting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>organize any competition that was really</v>

117
00:06:43.821 --> 00:06:47.150
<v Speaker 1>worth seeing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just as in Formula One came about,</v>

118
00:06:47.151 --> 00:06:47.984
<v Speaker 1>when most people started having cars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>east sports came when most people </v>

119
00:06:50.721 --> 00:06:51.554
<v Speaker 1>started having high speed Internet </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections and you might be able to </v>

120
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:56.240
<v Speaker 1>guess the first country where </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitions were hell's.</v>

121
00:06:56.330 --> 00:07:00.430
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was South Korea in 2006.</v>

122
00:07:00.431 --> 00:07:04.750
<v Speaker 1>South Korea was the country with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest Internet on the planet's ended.</v>

123
00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:05.613
<v Speaker 1>That time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of the population had broadband </v>

124
00:07:06.701 --> 00:07:07.840
<v Speaker 1>connections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

125
00:07:07.841 --> 00:07:08.674
<v Speaker 1>this was the perfect breeding grounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first big halo or starcraft </v>

126
00:07:11.951 --> 00:07:12.784
<v Speaker 1>players to emerge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so how did these plants become </v>

127
00:07:14.801 --> 00:07:15.634
<v Speaker 1>famous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:20.640
<v Speaker 1>that's through streaming platforms such </v>
<v Speaker 1>as youtube or above will twitch.tv,</v>

129
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:25.210
<v Speaker 1>and that is essentially how east sports </v>
<v Speaker 1>fever broke out in South Korea.</v>

130
00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:32.150
<v Speaker 1>Souls getting a new dedicated esports </v>
<v Speaker 1>stadium come March 2016.</v>

131
00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:36.393
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You may be wondering who would be the </v>

132
00:07:37.420 --> 00:07:42.070
<v Speaker 1>Bernie ecclestone of eastport and well </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced is riot games.</v>

133
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.400
<v Speaker 1>This is the company that created the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most successful game of all time,</v>

134
00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:51.460
<v Speaker 1>League of legends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was released in 2009.</v>

135
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:55.660
<v Speaker 1>We talking about a video game that seems</v>
<v Speaker 1>to have been made for competitions.</v>

136
00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.430
<v Speaker 1>I mean check this out too,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that time.</v>

137
00:07:57.431 --> 00:07:59.440
<v Speaker 1>Online games where,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do we say it?</v>

138
00:07:59.441 --> 00:08:00.274
<v Speaker 1>A bit rudimentary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there were titles like world </v>

139
00:08:01.901 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 1>of warcraft,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which had fantastic graphics and a great</v>

140
00:08:04.061 --> 00:08:06.580
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these were role playing game,</v>

141
00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:10.000
<v Speaker 1>which one can play for hours and never </v>
<v Speaker 1>win and never lose.</v>

142
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.490
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to pay a monthly fee to pay and</v>

143
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:16.790
<v Speaker 1>not everyone can afford that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

144
00:08:16.791 --> 00:08:17.624
<v Speaker 1>at League of legends is free,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has great graphics and an unbeatable </v>

145
00:08:20.331 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mode and games last for about an hour.</v>

146
00:08:23.060 --> 00:08:26.180
<v Speaker 1>They have a winning and losing team in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>very short time.</v>

147
00:08:26.300 --> 00:08:28.820
<v Speaker 1>This video game gained millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>players around them.</v>

148
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:31.463
<v Speaker 1>They were connected by the Internet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The teams that were created were </v>

149
00:08:33.601 --> 00:08:35.550
<v Speaker 1>completely international.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

150
00:08:35.551 --> 00:08:37.470
<v Speaker 1>at one of the best nine groups known as </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin,</v>

151
00:08:37.471 --> 00:08:40.080
<v Speaker 1>has Spanish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>French and finished plans.</v>

152
00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:45.170
<v Speaker 1>The truth is the by the year 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a critical mass of users and to</v>

153
00:08:48.581 --> 00:08:49.414
<v Speaker 1>celebrate it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they went to an industry festival that </v>

154
00:08:50.501 --> 00:08:51.334
<v Speaker 1>was being held in Sweden.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had an audience and they place to </v>

155
00:08:53.681 --> 00:08:54.514
<v Speaker 1>celebrate the championship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing their players to share their </v>

156
00:08:56.641 --> 00:08:57.474
<v Speaker 1>screens on youtube or twitch was enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>to offer a show on an international </v>

157
00:09:00.811 --> 00:09:02.290
<v Speaker 1>scale,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as we always say it,</v>

158
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:04.510
<v Speaker 1>as it was said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was</v>

159
00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.743
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

160
00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.240
<v Speaker 1>Championship reaches 900,000 viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing was clear,</v>

161
00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.750
<v Speaker 1>there was an audience he wanted to watch</v>
<v Speaker 1>matches from their favorite game on that</v>

162
00:09:16.751 --> 00:09:20.710
<v Speaker 1>computer screens from the initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>900,000 spectators,</v>

163
00:09:20.711 --> 00:09:21.544
<v Speaker 1>we now have surpassed more than 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million and the players who are now </v>

164
00:09:24.851 --> 00:09:27.910
<v Speaker 1>professionals travel around the wells on</v>
<v Speaker 1>athlete visas.</v>

165
00:09:27.970 --> 00:09:30.880
<v Speaker 1>This means that from the institutional </v>
<v Speaker 1>point of view,</v>

166
00:09:30.990 --> 00:09:31.823
<v Speaker 1>League of legends is now considered a </v>
<v Speaker 1>rightful sport and swear there's an </v>

167
00:09:35.411 --> 00:09:36.244
<v Speaker 1>audience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also companies willing to pay </v>

168
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:39.550
<v Speaker 1>for publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget,</v>

169
00:09:39.580 --> 00:09:40.920
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about video games.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

170
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:43.660
<v Speaker 1>a perfect environment to sell computers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>graphics,</v>

171
00:09:43.661 --> 00:09:44.740
<v Speaker 1>cards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>screens,</v>

172
00:09:44.830 --> 00:09:45.663
<v Speaker 1>or even high speed Internet connection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's every technology company has </v>

173
00:09:53.621 --> 00:09:58.090
<v Speaker 1>recently decided to sponsor events.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

174
00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.680
<v Speaker 1>that's where the gains come from as </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also huge investors willing to</v>

175
00:10:02.681 --> 00:10:03.514
<v Speaker 1>invest in this industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's investment research highlights </v>

176
00:10:08.471 --> 00:10:09.304
<v Speaker 1>three east stocks to watch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's clear east sports or a business </v>

177
00:10:12.191 --> 00:10:15.610
<v Speaker 1>that is growing by leaps and bounds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how far can it go?</v>

178
00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.593
<v Speaker 1>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be talking about the new Formula </v>

179
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:21.430
<v Speaker 1>One.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

180
00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:22.293
<v Speaker 1>if you remember,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mentioned that most of Formula One's </v>

181
00:10:23.621 --> 00:10:24.454
<v Speaker 1>income comes from the rights sold to TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>network to now he's some broadcast </v>

182
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.853
<v Speaker 1>openly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freely through online streaming </v>

183
00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.640
<v Speaker 1>platforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

184
00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:37.500
<v Speaker 1>there doesn't seem to be a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>television business here.</v>

185
00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:38.700
<v Speaker 1>As on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so far,</v>

186
00:10:38.701 --> 00:10:39.534
<v Speaker 1>new governments or municipalities have </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed willing to pay to host a </v>

187
00:10:42.241 --> 00:10:43.380
<v Speaker 1>tournament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

188
00:10:43.381 --> 00:10:47.190
<v Speaker 1>for me to one has a diversified business</v>
<v Speaker 1>with different income streams,</v>

189
00:10:47.191 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 1>which means that even in times of </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

190
00:10:49.140 --> 00:10:51.120
<v Speaker 1>the company continues to make an income.</v>

191
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:57.653
<v Speaker 1>At the moment it seems that the bulk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>esports income depends largely on their </v>

192
00:11:00.971 --> 00:11:04.870
<v Speaker 1>sponsors and by definition sponsor based</v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses are on stable,</v>

193
00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:05.733
<v Speaker 1>but above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest problem with this type of </v>

194
00:11:07.271 --> 00:11:08.104
<v Speaker 1>sports is variety.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's only one formula one does that </v>

195
00:11:10.601 --> 00:11:11.434
<v Speaker 1>mean one football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are lots of esports and we </v>

196
00:11:13.961 --> 00:11:16.720
<v Speaker 1>don't know which ones were lost and </v>
<v Speaker 1>which ones worked.</v>

197
00:11:16.810 --> 00:11:19.750
<v Speaker 1>League of legends has achieved and </v>
<v Speaker 1>undeniable amounts of success,</v>

198
00:11:19.751 --> 00:11:22.300
<v Speaker 1>but it was created in 2009.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

199
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:26.160
<v Speaker 1>will it still be fashionable in another </v>
<v Speaker 1>10 years or will a new electronic sports</v>

200
00:11:26.161 --> 00:11:27.370
<v Speaker 1>emerge that will pick up</v>

201
00:11:27.500 --> 00:11:28.660
<v Speaker 2>that awesome.</v>

202
00:11:34.290 --> 00:11:35.670
<v Speaker 1>No mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sports,</v>

203
00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:36.563
<v Speaker 1>they're here to stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is which one is worth </v>

204
00:11:38.911 --> 00:11:41.070
<v Speaker 1>investing in in the long run?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

205
00:11:41.071 --> 00:11:44.100
<v Speaker 1>these are all reasonable doubts for any </v>
<v Speaker 1>new industry and uncertain.</v>

206
00:11:44.101 --> 00:11:46.860
<v Speaker 1>No circumstances do we want to </v>
<v Speaker 1>underestimate this phenomenon.</v>

207
00:11:46.930 --> 00:11:49.290
<v Speaker 1>That's as we always say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic.</v>

208
00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.660
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything is as it seems and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>devil,</v>

209
00:11:51.780 --> 00:11:56.440
<v Speaker 1>whether it's in the detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>

210
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.363
<v Speaker 1>I'll leave you with this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you invest in an sports company </v>

211
00:11:59.650 --> 00:12:00.483
<v Speaker 1>right now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we're facing a new mass </v>

212
00:12:02.310 --> 00:12:03.143
<v Speaker 1>sport that will generate millions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars swelled and leave your onset in </v>
