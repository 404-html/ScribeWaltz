1
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:07.973
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to start today off with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question because I want to know when is </v>

2
00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:14.370
<v Speaker 1>the last time you bought a music cd like</v>
<v Speaker 1>this one.</v>

3
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

4
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.463
<v Speaker 1>This is naturally a music cd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a CD that my Internet provider </v>

5
00:00:19.631 --> 00:00:24.631
<v Speaker 1>sent me to set up my router seriously </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the millennials watching this video,</v>

6
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:27.780
<v Speaker 1>compact disc was a thing that had songs </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

7
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:29.190
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before the Internet era,</v>

8
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.670
<v Speaker 1>if you wanted to listen to music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you actually have to buy it.</v>

9
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.540
<v Speaker 1>There was this thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

10
00:00:33.541 --> 00:00:34.374
<v Speaker 1>a record shop and there was a cd or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>cassette tape and these things can cost </v>

11
00:00:37.651 --> 00:00:42.651
<v Speaker 1>up to $30.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know,</v>

12
00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:45.724
<v Speaker 1>I know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all seems pretty bizarre these days </v>

13
00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:51.040
<v Speaker 1>going to a physical store to purchase </v>
<v Speaker 1>music in less than 20 years,</v>

14
00:00:51.041 --> 00:00:53.830
<v Speaker 1>record sales have almost disappeared in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the year.</v>

15
00:00:53.831 --> 00:00:54.664
<v Speaker 1>2,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More than 900 million cds were sold in </v>

16
00:00:57.581 --> 00:01:00.040
<v Speaker 1>America alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eighteen years later,</v>

17
00:01:00.041 --> 00:01:00.874
<v Speaker 1>this number has dropped to 90 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's less than a 10th of what it used </v>

18
00:01:04.661 --> 00:01:05.494
<v Speaker 1>to be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reason of course is internet </v>

19
00:01:07.331 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 1>downloads.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Platforms like napster,</v>

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.100
<v Speaker 1>email and torrance have completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed the industry,</v>

21
00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.410
<v Speaker 1>and of course you might think in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

22
00:01:14.411 --> 00:01:16.930
<v Speaker 1>record labels must be going totally </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt,</v>

23
00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.160
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

24
00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean actually the opposite is true.</v>

25
00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.023
<v Speaker 2>University</v>

26
00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.423
<v Speaker 1>music group turned over an average of 17</v>
<v Speaker 1>point $5,000,000 per day in 2017 as the </v>

27
00:01:32.661 --> 00:01:36.980
<v Speaker 1>company's annual sales hit record highs </v>
<v Speaker 1>topping $6,000,000,000,</v>

28
00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.160
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other music companies like Sony,</v>

29
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:42.590
<v Speaker 1>music or Warner are in a similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation,</v>

30
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.370
<v Speaker 1>absolutely record profits sands in case </v>
<v Speaker 1>you were wondering,</v>

31
00:01:46.371 --> 00:01:49.850
<v Speaker 1>the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Streaming platforms like Pandora,</v>

32
00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:50.713
<v Speaker 1>Deezer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course spotify are not enough to </v>

33
00:01:52.731 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>explain this phenomenon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

34
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Taylor swift is one of the world's most </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous artists.</v>

35
00:01:57.431 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Injury now hardly even makes $400,000 a </v>
<v Speaker 1>year from spotify listens.</v>

36
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.200
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this might seem like a lot,</v>

37
00:02:03.201 --> 00:02:06.770
<v Speaker 1>but believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is absolute pennies compared with the</v>

38
00:02:06.771 --> 00:02:10.010
<v Speaker 1>mega money that Michael Jackson made </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the sales of thriller.</v>

39
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.070
<v Speaker 1>So why are record labels making so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>

40
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.963
<v Speaker 1>How could they even survive all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal internet downloads and file </v>

41
00:02:16.761 --> 00:02:19.190
<v Speaker 1>sharing platforms like napster and </v>
<v Speaker 1>email?</v>

42
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.083
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer these </v>

43
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:21.950
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

44
00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.430
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creative destruction in the.</v>

45
00:02:28.871 --> 00:02:29.704
<v Speaker 1>In 1935,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Union of American musicians </v>

46
00:02:31.671 --> 00:02:36.671
<v Speaker 1>published this statement are multiplied </v>
<v Speaker 1>and duplicated by the thousands and then</v>

47
00:02:38.641 --> 00:02:42.480
<v Speaker 1>sold to and used in places where </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise musicians would be employed.</v>

48
00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:43.433
<v Speaker 1>According to this union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 8,000 professional musicians </v>

49
00:02:45.721 --> 00:02:49.020
<v Speaker 1>that lost their jobs because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>so-called jukeboxes.</v>

50
00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.850
<v Speaker 1>A box for those who don't know is a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>record plant,</v>

51
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.460
<v Speaker 1>sits in a bar or restaurant so you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>insert a coin and choose a song that you</v>

52
00:02:56.461 --> 00:02:57.294
<v Speaker 1>want</v>

53
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:01.520
<v Speaker 1>by the end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 35,</v>

54
00:03:01.521 --> 00:03:06.500
<v Speaker 1>more than 135,000 machines like this one</v>
<v Speaker 1>was sold throughout the United States,</v>

55
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:07.363
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time that those 8,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>traditional musicians were taken out of </v>

56
00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:10.874
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Benny Goodman was signing a million </v>

57
00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.490
<v Speaker 1>dollar contract with a label called RCA </v>
<v Speaker 1>victor.</v>

58
00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.050
<v Speaker 1>The business model of the music industry</v>
<v Speaker 1>had already changed forever.</v>

59
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.913
<v Speaker 1>Prior to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians lived off the money they made </v>

60
00:03:26.271 --> 00:03:27.440
<v Speaker 1>from concerts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.430
<v Speaker 1>the first music records swept used as </v>
<v Speaker 1>advertising for the life performances,</v>

62
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:35.420
<v Speaker 1>but now 90 percent of their income was </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from record sales.</v>

63
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:39.120
<v Speaker 1>This is a process which we call creative</v>
<v Speaker 1>destruction,</v>

64
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.963
<v Speaker 1>but this was more of an economic shift.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The way we listened to music changed </v>

65
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.400
<v Speaker 1>forever as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>

66
00:03:51.401 --> 00:03:54.400
<v Speaker 1>some local music genre started being </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoyed nationwide,</v>

67
00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of jazz music was a typical genre in New</v>

68
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.503
<v Speaker 1>Orleans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it ended up expanding all over </v>

69
00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:00.334
<v Speaker 1>America and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this also changed the way that we </v>

70
00:04:03.071 --> 00:04:03.904
<v Speaker 1>understood music.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it before we could record </v>

71
00:04:05.531 --> 00:04:06.364
<v Speaker 1>music,</v>
<v Speaker 1>musicians could only do live </v>

72
00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:08.373
<v Speaker 1>performances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That maximum audience was just a few </v>

73
00:04:10.691 --> 00:04:14.110
<v Speaker 1>hundred people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly radios and records allowed them</v>

74
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:14.944
<v Speaker 1>to reach millions and this way it made a</v>
<v Speaker 1>whole lot more money is how a new genre </v>

75
00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.970
<v Speaker 1>was created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a musical style made for radio,</v>

76
00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.870
<v Speaker 1>and that's of course rock and roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a style of music that originated</v>

77
00:04:31.871 --> 00:04:32.704
<v Speaker 1>in America and ended up expanding to all</v>
<v Speaker 1>parts of the West from Los Angeles to </v>

78
00:04:37.061 --> 00:04:42.061
<v Speaker 1>Berlin rock stars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're no longer just simple artists.</v>

79
00:04:44.371 --> 00:04:47.190
<v Speaker 1>They were engines inside of a complex </v>
<v Speaker 1>machine,</v>

80
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.800
<v Speaker 1>the record label,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paying for marketing campaigns,</v>

81
00:04:49.801 --> 00:04:50.634
<v Speaker 1>organized massive concerts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even negotiated advertising deals </v>

82
00:04:53.131 --> 00:04:56.990
<v Speaker 1>for them and meanwhile the Rockstar gave</v>
<v Speaker 1>the whole industry a young,</v>

83
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.863
<v Speaker 1>fresh face</v>

84
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:07.440
<v Speaker 1>is why wild about is like Elvis and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beatles became millionaires.</v>

85
00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>The big companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It just got bigger and bigger.</v>

86
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:11.253
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music was not just listened to all </v>

87
00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:16.030
<v Speaker 1>across the developed world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A record like Michael Jackson's thriller</v>

88
00:05:16.031 --> 00:05:16.864
<v Speaker 1>could sell more than 66 million copies </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a brand new market that stretched </v>

89
00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:24.310
<v Speaker 1>from La to Tokyo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the in 1999 in the music industry had</v>

90
00:05:24.311 --> 00:05:25.480
<v Speaker 1>reached its ceiling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

91
00:05:25.481 --> 00:05:28.660
<v Speaker 1>there's $1,200 million records had been </v>
<v Speaker 1>sold.</v>

92
00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:33.190
<v Speaker 1>The business was bigger than the GDP of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a country like the Dominican Republic.</v>

93
00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.190
<v Speaker 1>And what happens when an industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>generates so much money?</v>

94
00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.233
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big guys start eating the smaller </v>

95
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.830
<v Speaker 1>for a better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that moment,</v>

96
00:05:44.831 --> 00:05:45.664
<v Speaker 1>78 percent of the industry was </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated in just five big </v>

97
00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:51.460
<v Speaker 1>multinationals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then when the music industry was the</v>

98
00:05:51.461 --> 00:05:55.320
<v Speaker 1>ultimate moneymaking machine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something rather surprising habits.</v>

99
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.060
<v Speaker 1>Remember that thing I said about </v>
<v Speaker 1>creative destruction?</v>

100
00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.043
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there's one good example of positive </v>

101
00:06:06.251 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 1>distraction,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's napster.</v>

102
00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:09.003
<v Speaker 1>Napster was the first software that </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed users to download songs in MP </v>

103
00:06:12.281 --> 00:06:13.114
<v Speaker 1>three format in a fast free and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course illegal way from one day to the </v>

104
00:06:17.231 --> 00:06:18.064
<v Speaker 1>next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those records that could cost $30 could </v>

105
00:06:19.751 --> 00:06:24.220
<v Speaker 1>be found for free online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you can see on this chart,</v>

106
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:26.500
<v Speaker 1>this was the beginning of the end.</v>

107
00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:33.350
<v Speaker 1>Even though napster lost a case in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>courts,</v>

108
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.203
<v Speaker 1>it was already too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music business had already changed </v>

109
00:06:36.421 --> 00:06:37.740
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>

110
00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.360
<v Speaker 1>why would you buy something if you can </v>
<v Speaker 1>get it for</v>

111
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.273
<v Speaker 2>great,</v>

112
00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:47.560
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a minute here because I</v>
<v Speaker 1>haven't looked at the chart again,</v>

113
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:48.453
<v Speaker 1>if you pay attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll see that despite a dramatic </v>

114
00:06:50.801 --> 00:06:53.920
<v Speaker 1>decline in record sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the profit for company is like universal</v>

115
00:06:53.921 --> 00:06:56.440
<v Speaker 1>music group hasn't actually changed that</v>
<v Speaker 1>much.</v>

116
00:06:56.470 --> 00:06:57.610
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

117
00:06:57.611 --> 00:07:02.611
<v Speaker 1>let's explain that right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Size matters drillers.</v>

118
00:07:05.441 --> 00:07:07.990
<v Speaker 1>8,000 musicians that lost their jobs in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1935.</v>

119
00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the year 2000,</v>

120
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.620
<v Speaker 1>something similar happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universal music,</v>

121
00:07:11.621 --> 00:07:14.800
<v Speaker 1>fod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>4,000 people practically overnight.</v>

122
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.370
<v Speaker 1>This was 34 percent of their staff at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this point,</v>

123
00:07:18.371 --> 00:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>record sales were almost 90 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>their income and those sales,</v>

124
00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:24.900
<v Speaker 1>they were falling by 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

125
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:26.213
<v Speaker 1>often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

126
00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:33.220
<v Speaker 1>and this moment is when the executives </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the big record labels started singing</v>

127
00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:34.054
<v Speaker 1>the same old tune that we've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about over and over again in </v>

128
00:07:36.341 --> 00:07:37.174
<v Speaker 1>this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course creative destruction if </v>

129
00:07:44.951 --> 00:07:48.880
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to survive that to make a </v>
<v Speaker 1>180 degree shift to the company,</v>

130
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.870
<v Speaker 1>they had to stop being a record label </v>
<v Speaker 1>and start becoming a music label.</v>

131
00:07:53.050 --> 00:07:53.621
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

132
00:07:53.621 --> 00:07:55.540
<v Speaker 1>But you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does that actually mean?</v>

133
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.433
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at the example of </v>

134
00:07:57.701 --> 00:07:58.534
<v Speaker 1>universal music reading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first step for creative destruction </v>

135
00:08:00.911 --> 00:08:02.650
<v Speaker 1>is of course destruction.</v>

136
00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.470
<v Speaker 1>In the past decade of the 21st century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>universal got rid of everything that was</v>

137
00:08:10.471 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 1>not making it any money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was that?</v>

138
00:08:12.630 --> 00:08:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be the record.</v>

139
00:08:14.311 --> 00:08:15.144
<v Speaker 1>Manufacturing factories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sold as many of those things as </v>

140
00:08:17.731 --> 00:08:18.564
<v Speaker 1>possible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's next up in creative </v>

141
00:08:19.741 --> 00:08:20.910
<v Speaker 1>destruction?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

142
00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.833
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's creativity with all the money </v>

143
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.113
<v Speaker 1>they got from selling the factories.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Universal bought all the music labels </v>

144
00:08:26.941 --> 00:08:30.400
<v Speaker 1>they possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main goal was to expand them,</v>

145
00:08:30.401 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 1>use a catalog as much as possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which explains news like this,</v>

146
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.393
<v Speaker 1>universal music group purchases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Emi music label group will acquire </v>

147
00:08:42.911 --> 00:08:44.950
<v Speaker 1>catalogs of the Beatles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pink Floyd,</v>

148
00:08:45.070 --> 00:08:49.120
<v Speaker 1>radiohead and more so what happens after</v>
<v Speaker 1>some creative destruction like this?</v>

149
00:08:49.180 --> 00:08:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Well tastes to musical genres.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They changed.</v>

150
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:54.610
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have k pop with songs like gangnam</v>

151
00:08:54.610 --> 00:08:55.443
<v Speaker 2>style</v>

152
00:08:59.290 --> 00:09:02.680
<v Speaker 1>genre in South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's ended up expanding to the rest of</v>

153
00:09:02.681 --> 00:09:03.670
<v Speaker 1>the wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

154
00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.673
<v Speaker 1>Of Us in the 19 thirties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music industry was limited to the </v>

155
00:09:07.870 --> 00:09:10.810
<v Speaker 1>United States then in the eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it expanded throughout the West.</v>

156
00:09:10.811 --> 00:09:11.644
<v Speaker 1>Now in the two thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music is a 100 percent global industry </v>

157
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:19.960
<v Speaker 1>and companies like universal have bought</v>
<v Speaker 1>labels in every market.</v>

158
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.083
<v Speaker 1>You could have</v>

159
00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:23.720
<v Speaker 2>university.</v>

160
00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>music science.</v>

161
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:29.710
<v Speaker 1>Ten cent deal for China expands music </v>
<v Speaker 1>group to relaunch emi records in.</v>

162
00:09:33.180 --> 00:09:34.013
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

163
00:09:36.330 --> 00:09:37.163
<v Speaker 1>Bursal buys majority stake in Kenyan </v>
<v Speaker 1>label ai records and now you might </v>

164
00:09:41.611 --> 00:09:42.480
<v Speaker 1>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

165
00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>but no matter how many labels you have </v>
<v Speaker 1>by,</v>

166
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:45.534
<v Speaker 1>if people don't buy music anymore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're income's going to fold </v>

167
00:09:47.671 --> 00:09:48.960
<v Speaker 1>inevitably.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright.</v>

168
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

169
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:51.060
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You are right.</v>

170
00:09:51.061 --> 00:09:51.894
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the music industry today is nothing but </v>

171
00:09:53.310 --> 00:09:57.870
<v Speaker 1>a shadow of what it used to be so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the difference?</v>

172
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.771
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

173
00:09:58.771 --> 00:10:01.130
<v Speaker 1>despite the cake being smaller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

174
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:06.140
<v Speaker 1>way less people using,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see on the chart,</v>

175
00:10:07.010 --> 00:10:11.450
<v Speaker 1>72 percent of the industry is covered by</v>
<v Speaker 1>three big multinationals,</v>

176
00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.860
<v Speaker 1>universal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sony,</v>

177
00:10:12.861 --> 00:10:13.694
<v Speaker 1>music and Warner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes now is when we start talking </v>

178
00:10:17.810 --> 00:10:19.880
<v Speaker 1>about spotify,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>

179
00:10:19.881 --> 00:10:22.580
<v Speaker 1>spotify gives various or money to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>artists.</v>

180
00:10:22.581 --> 00:10:25.610
<v Speaker 1>1 million listens only means about </v>
<v Speaker 1>$7,000,</v>

181
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:26.563
<v Speaker 1>but when you have the rights of 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the music produced in the </v>

182
00:10:29.151 --> 00:10:31.250
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even if you make one point zero,</v>

183
00:10:31.340 --> 00:10:35.360
<v Speaker 1>$0 per listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're still become a million app today.</v>

184
00:10:35.361 --> 00:10:36.194
<v Speaker 1>Record sales,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've gone from being 90 percent of </v>

185
00:10:38.481 --> 00:10:41.090
<v Speaker 1>the industry's profits to just $25</v>

186
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:47.713
<v Speaker 1>and streaming music represents six out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of every $10 entering the music </v>

187
00:10:51.141 --> 00:10:52.160
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

188
00:10:52.161 --> 00:10:52.994
<v Speaker 1>this is great news for multinational </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations which make more and more </v>

189
00:10:55.911 --> 00:10:56.744
<v Speaker 1>money that as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not so good news for the </v>

190
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:00.044
<v Speaker 1>musicians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's harder and harder to make money </v>

191
00:11:01.821 --> 00:11:02.654
<v Speaker 1>with music and this is why you need to </v>
<v Speaker 1>be extremely popular to make any money </v>

192
00:11:05.841 --> 00:11:07.100
<v Speaker 1>out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

193
00:11:07.101 --> 00:11:07.934
<v Speaker 1>those three big labels aren't willing to</v>
<v Speaker 1>risk what they have by experimenting </v>

194
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.133
<v Speaker 1>with new formulas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always a minute because this is not </v>

195
00:11:14.661 --> 00:11:15.494
<v Speaker 1>so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been following the news and </v>

196
00:11:16.511 --> 00:11:17.344
<v Speaker 1>the music industry lately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll probably see that there's a bit </v>

197
00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.660
<v Speaker 1>more room for some creative destruction.</v>

198
00:11:28.660 --> 00:11:33.070
<v Speaker 1>Now let's artists bypass labels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>upload their own music.</v>

199
00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you is if you have a bands,</v>

200
00:11:34.801 --> 00:11:35.634
<v Speaker 1>you can now upload your songs directly </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spotify and get your royalties </v>

201
00:11:38.770 --> 00:11:41.260
<v Speaker 1>without a middleman way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>

202
00:11:41.261 --> 00:11:44.290
<v Speaker 1>if you do make good music and you want </v>
<v Speaker 1>some free advertising,</v>

203
00:11:44.291 --> 00:11:45.124
<v Speaker 1>do send us.</v>

<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

207
00:11:53.831 --> 00:11:54.664
<v Speaker 1>the big question now is will we </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessed the advent of a new creative </v>

208
00:11:58.001 --> 00:11:59.890
<v Speaker 1>destruction process in the music </v>
