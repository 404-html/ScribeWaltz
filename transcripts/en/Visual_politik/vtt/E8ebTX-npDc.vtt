1
00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:09.103
<v Speaker 1>Latin America is perhaps the region with</v>
<v Speaker 1>the least military ambition in the </v>

2
00:00:12.371 --> 00:00:13.204
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government spends relatively little </v>

3
00:00:21.911 --> 00:00:24.100
<v Speaker 1>on the fence and in general with some </v>
<v Speaker 1>exceptions,</v>

4
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:29.101
<v Speaker 1>creating large and powerful armies bids,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not exactly a priority like this.</v>

5
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.420
<v Speaker 1>The subjects of the armed forces has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been very controversial in the region in</v>

6
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:37.254
<v Speaker 1>recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's no one's there because the </v>

7
00:00:39.061 --> 00:00:42.660
<v Speaker 1>second half of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't exactly a quiet time.</v>

8
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.670
<v Speaker 1>The Latin America throughout this </v>
<v Speaker 1>period,</v>

9
00:00:44.671 --> 00:00:47.340
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the 19 sixties and 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies,</v>

10
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.450
<v Speaker 1>this region was one of the territories </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world which was the most effected</v>

11
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.710
<v Speaker 1>by military force.</v>

12
00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.440
<v Speaker 2>What about Amada</v>

13
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:24.643
<v Speaker 1>for the easiest?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Practically every country in the region </v>

14
00:01:26.211 --> 00:01:31.100
<v Speaker 1>participated in what kind of became a </v>
<v Speaker 1>macabre tradition of military groups and</v>

15
00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:33.470
<v Speaker 1>of course plenty of repression.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

16
00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at 1978 in that year </v>
<v Speaker 1>among other countries,</v>

17
00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:06.730
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>

18
00:02:06.731 --> 00:02:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>

19
00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:08.650
<v Speaker 1>Ecuador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paraguay,</v>

20
00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:09.540
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

21
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:10.900
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Honduras,</v>

22
00:02:10.901 --> 00:02:11.980
<v Speaker 1>El Salvador,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panama,</v>

23
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.160
<v Speaker 1>as even the peaceful year ago when I </v>
<v Speaker 1>went under a military dictatorship,</v>

24
00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.400
<v Speaker 1>and do forgive me if I left anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else because you could see it's a pretty</v>

25
00:02:18.401 --> 00:02:19.234
<v Speaker 1>long list.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dictators of every kind existed left </v>

26
00:02:21.941 --> 00:02:24.070
<v Speaker 1>rights pro us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>andy us harder,</v>

27
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.430
<v Speaker 1>softer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

28
00:02:25.431 --> 00:02:29.670
<v Speaker 1>they all had one common elements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was repression.</v>

29
00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the framework of the Cold War and </v>

30
00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:37.270
<v Speaker 1>block struggles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these dictatorships,</v>

31
00:02:37.271 --> 00:02:38.104
<v Speaker 1>they were supported by the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>under the framework of what was later </v>

32
00:02:41.141 --> 00:02:41.974
<v Speaker 1>known as Operation Condo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a sinister intelligence collaboration </v>

33
00:02:44.891 --> 00:02:46.420
<v Speaker 1>plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately in the military,</v>

34
00:02:46.421 --> 00:02:48.490
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships of the yellows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

35
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.600
<v Speaker 1>Pinochet's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>

36
00:02:49.601 --> 00:02:52.630
<v Speaker 1>Alfredo strossner's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paraguayan Joelle figure raters,</v>

37
00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:53.810
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends border,</v>

38
00:02:53.811 --> 00:02:54.644
<v Speaker 1>Barry's Uruguay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They will all aided by the CIA in order </v>

39
00:02:57.821 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>to achieve a single prosecutes and </v>
<v Speaker 1>annihilate the political opposition,</v>

40
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.920
<v Speaker 1>especially the leftist groups that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported by the Soviet regime.</v>

41
00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:06.803
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

42
00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.720
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you might expect,</v>

43
00:03:09.721 --> 00:03:12.330
<v Speaker 1>the dictatorships forged under the other</v>
<v Speaker 1>political color.</v>

44
00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>They weren't any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all</v>

45
00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.133
<v Speaker 2>facts</v>

46
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.203
<v Speaker 1>during this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't hard to imagine why the armed </v>

47
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:19.514
<v Speaker 1>forces issue has been so controversial.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well more than 30 years have now passed </v>

48
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.253
<v Speaker 1>since this dark periods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this video we're going to be </v>

49
00:03:26.241 --> 00:03:27.074
<v Speaker 1>answering several questions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the current state of Latin </v>

50
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.953
<v Speaker 1>America is all nice?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What functions do they really have and </v>

51
00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:36.290
<v Speaker 1>do they pose any risk to the democracy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and freedom of these countries?</v>

52
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:37.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's dive in.</v>

53
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.600
<v Speaker 1>He's in Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we begin,</v>

54
00:03:46.601 --> 00:03:49.250
<v Speaker 1>and just out of curiosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well let me ask you a question.</v>

55
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.860
<v Speaker 1>Which do you think are the strongest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful armies in Latin America?</v>

56
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.570
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is always quite subjective,</v>

57
00:03:56.571 --> 00:04:00.080
<v Speaker 1>but according to the global firepower </v>
<v Speaker 1>index from 2017,</v>

58
00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:00.914
<v Speaker 1>which is an indicator that attempts to </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure which armies and more powerful </v>

59
00:04:03.261 --> 00:04:06.950
<v Speaker 1>and the different parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the top five in Latin America,</v>

60
00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.420
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not really surprising.</v>

61
00:04:08.421 --> 00:04:11.180
<v Speaker 1>It goes to Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the greatest regional power.</v>

62
00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:13.580
<v Speaker 1>This is followed by you in this order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

63
00:04:13.581 --> 00:04:14.750
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>

64
00:04:14.751 --> 00:04:15.450
<v Speaker 1>and Colombia.</v>

65
00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is</v>

66
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:18.933
<v Speaker 1>the Latin America is the region with </v>
<v Speaker 1>these small list of budget dedicated to </v>

67
00:04:22.001 --> 00:04:26.050
<v Speaker 1>defense in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was just over one percent of its GDP,</v>

68
00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.913
<v Speaker 1>which is about $67,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This expenditure is much lower than the </v>

69
00:04:30.791 --> 00:04:31.624
<v Speaker 1>global average,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because last and American </v>

70
00:04:33.191 --> 00:04:36.280
<v Speaker 1>armies tend to have quite a high number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of soldiers</v>

71
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 1>to get some idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In total,</v>

72
00:04:42.851 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 1>the region has over one point seven,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$3 million soldiers.</v>

73
00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.073
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the combination of a low budget with </v>

74
00:04:49.271 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 1>many soldiers needs to outdated armies </v>
<v Speaker 1>with plenty of operational problems.</v>

75
00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:56.230
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>army.</v>

76
00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:01.260
<v Speaker 1>The Brazilian army Brazil spends 23 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point $7,000,000,000 every year,</v>

77
00:05:02.831 --> 00:05:05.680
<v Speaker 1>which kind of on the face of it seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>like quite a lot,</v>

78
00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:06.341
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:09.850
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that the army has 340,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers,</v>

80
00:05:09.851 --> 00:05:14.260
<v Speaker 1>which means that three quarters of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget goes to salaries and pensions.</v>

81
00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>If to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we add basic supplies,</v>

82
00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.940
<v Speaker 1>then the money left for equipment is </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

83
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.970
<v Speaker 1>very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As in the rest of Latin America ratio is</v>

84
00:05:26.251 --> 00:05:27.450
<v Speaker 1>a similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On average,</v>

85
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.840
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of the money goes directly to</v>
<v Speaker 1>salaries.</v>

86
00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.700
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin American armies usually have a lot</v>

87
00:05:36.701 --> 00:05:41.701
<v Speaker 1>of soldiers and very little equipment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Looking inward.</v>

88
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.450
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

89
00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:55.210
<v Speaker 1>if we talk about armies wars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflicts between countries,</v>

90
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.073
<v Speaker 1>we could say that last and America is </v>
<v Speaker 1>one the most peaceful regions in the </v>

91
00:05:59.061 --> 00:05:59.894
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last arms conflict occurred in 1995 </v>

92
00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:05.930
<v Speaker 1>and what was later known as the Sun Epa </v>
<v Speaker 1>wore this involved Ecuador and Peru,</v>

93
00:06:05.931 --> 00:06:08.600
<v Speaker 1>but no formal declaration of war was </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever made</v>

94
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.353
<v Speaker 1>is that the trend has begun that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>made Latin America a benchmark every </v>

95
00:06:17.691 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>time there was a conflict between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

96
00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:22.490
<v Speaker 1>instead of threatening each other with </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs and cannons.</v>

97
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Those involved resorts do international </v>
<v Speaker 1>justice.</v>

98
00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.560
<v Speaker 1>This is what is currently happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

99
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:28.394
<v Speaker 1>with the conflicts between Bolivia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili over the sea fronts may conflict </v>

100
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:32.324
<v Speaker 1>and that is being resolved at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>International Court of Justice in The </v>

101
00:06:34.431 --> 00:06:37.850
<v Speaker 1>Hague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Live your replies to the lawsuit against</v>

102
00:06:37.851 --> 00:06:40.880
<v Speaker 1>Chile at The Hague court for cxs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

103
00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.210
<v Speaker 1>internally well things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are completely different.</v>

104
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.103
<v Speaker 1>We could say that Latin America has the </v>
<v Speaker 1>record for being the most peaceful </v>

105
00:06:47.721 --> 00:06:50.930
<v Speaker 1>region and at the same time the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence one.</v>

106
00:06:54.650 --> 00:06:57.630
<v Speaker 1>Here's that between countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is no serious threat of war,</v>

107
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.620
<v Speaker 1>but the situation is different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we talk about internal violence,</v>

108
00:07:01.621 --> 00:07:02.454
<v Speaker 1>more incredible than that though is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that one in three homicides that </v>

109
00:07:05.641 --> 00:07:09.360
<v Speaker 1>occur every year globally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it take place in Latin America,</v>

110
00:07:09.361 --> 00:07:10.194
<v Speaker 1>so because apparently all enemies there </v>
<v Speaker 1>are Latin American military forces to </v>

111
00:07:13.621 --> 00:07:16.830
<v Speaker 1>focus on at home tasks such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>confronting gorillas,</v>

112
00:07:16.831 --> 00:07:17.664
<v Speaker 1>drug traffic has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or just dealing with violence in </v>

113
00:07:19.111 --> 00:07:20.100
<v Speaker 1>general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

114
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:20.963
<v Speaker 1>in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is becoming increasingly common for </v>

115
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:26.580
<v Speaker 1>military forces to replace the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>and security and surveillance tasks.</v>

116
00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:27.443
<v Speaker 1>The problem here is that evidence shows </v>
<v Speaker 1>that soldiers aren't really good at </v>

117
00:07:30.241 --> 00:07:35.241
<v Speaker 1>playing the role of the police.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Insufficient</v>

118
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:39.173
<v Speaker 2>solution.</v>

119
00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:44.900
<v Speaker 1>It's what we might think of first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Crime rates in Brazil or Mexico far from</v>

120
00:07:44.901 --> 00:07:45.734
<v Speaker 1>decreasing have increased since soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 1>began participating in citizen security </v>

121
00:07:50.030 --> 00:07:52.490
<v Speaker 1>in the five most dangerous cities in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

122
00:07:52.491 --> 00:07:53.840
<v Speaker 1>Caracas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Acapulco,</v>

123
00:07:53.841 --> 00:07:55.130
<v Speaker 1>San Pedro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sula,</v>

124
00:07:55.131 --> 00:07:55.964
<v Speaker 1>central districts and Victoria have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>military presence and well that's not </v>

125
00:07:59.841 --> 00:08:00.674
<v Speaker 1>all or abuse extra judicial detentions </v>
<v Speaker 1>or collateral victims have also </v>

126
00:08:08.681 --> 00:08:09.514
<v Speaker 1>increased with military presence which </v>
<v Speaker 1>further favors and feed say culture of </v>

127
00:08:12.821 --> 00:08:13.654
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that is unfortunately </v>

128
00:08:15.221 --> 00:08:17.160
<v Speaker 1>40 widespread in the region nowadays.</v>

129
00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.090
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

130
00:08:21.860 --> 00:08:26.510
<v Speaker 1>is that soldiers are forces trained for </v>
<v Speaker 1>war in order to eliminate the enemy,</v>

131
00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:29.840
<v Speaker 1>not to impose order and the rule of law </v>
<v Speaker 1>to achieve rule of law,</v>

132
00:08:29.841 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>what is needed to detectives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>courts,</v>

133
00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.140
<v Speaker 1>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>local police forces,</v>

134
00:08:33.141 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 1>and even citizen collaboration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the military.</v>

135
00:08:35.600 --> 00:08:37.850
<v Speaker 1>We can take a look at what has happened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

136
00:08:37.910 --> 00:08:38.743
<v Speaker 1>in Mexico,</v>

137
00:08:43.660 --> 00:08:46.360
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he became president in </v>
<v Speaker 1>December 2006,</v>

138
00:08:46.361 --> 00:08:50.290
<v Speaker 1>Philippe Calderon declared war on drugs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and placed the army on the streets.</v>

139
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only it has narcotics trafficking,</v>

140
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:56.460
<v Speaker 1>not decreased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but homicide rates of triples the army.</v>

141
00:08:56.550 --> 00:08:58.770
<v Speaker 1>It's simply not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can of course,</v>

142
00:08:58.771 --> 00:09:02.340
<v Speaker 1>lender hands in very serious cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they cannot be a police force.</v>

143
00:09:02.370 --> 00:09:03.960
<v Speaker 1>It just doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

144
00:09:03.961 --> 00:09:06.090
<v Speaker 1>I do know that corruption in the police </v>
<v Speaker 1>as a problem,</v>

145
00:09:06.091 --> 00:09:09.210
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't simply fixed by resorting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to using the army.</v>

146
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.103
<v Speaker 1>And indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this actually leads to two other major </v>

147
00:09:11.731 --> 00:09:14.100
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one is political risk.</v>

148
00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:14.993
<v Speaker 1>So consider this Latin America's armed </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces must be anti imperialist Eva </v>

149
00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Morales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:21.053
<v Speaker 1>why do you want me to say to me?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing politicians use military forces </v>

151
00:09:23.671 --> 00:09:26.190
<v Speaker 1>to defend that political ideas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whatever they might be,</v>

152
00:09:26.230 --> 00:09:28.290
<v Speaker 1>seems very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very dangerous.</v>

153
00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>Using that power of force is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be super tempting.</v>

154
00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:33.270
<v Speaker 1>This is what has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

155
00:09:33.271 --> 00:09:34.104
<v Speaker 1>in Venezuela where the armed forces have</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much become something like a </v>

156
00:09:36.541 --> 00:09:39.900
<v Speaker 1>Praetorian guard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For Nicolas Maduro has bolivarian regime</v>

157
00:09:43.860 --> 00:09:44.693
<v Speaker 1>as if that wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is also the big corruption </v>

158
00:09:47.041 --> 00:09:47.874
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the military industry is really </v>

159
00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.273
<v Speaker 1>opaque and it's got huge contracts which</v>
<v Speaker 1>are two pretty basic ingredients for </v>

160
00:09:53.911 --> 00:09:56.670
<v Speaker 1>corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have a look at what happens in 2010</v>

161
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:59.550
<v Speaker 1>in the Dominican Republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2010,</v>

162
00:09:59.580 --> 00:10:00.413
<v Speaker 1>a major corruption scandal affect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Dominican armed forces due to the fraud </v>

163
00:10:03.261 --> 00:10:04.094
<v Speaker 1>and the purchase of eight Super Tucano </v>
<v Speaker 1>aircraft from the Brazilian company </v>

164
00:10:07.540 --> 00:10:08.373
<v Speaker 1>Embraer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is suspected that $87,000,000 </v>

165
00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:11.214
<v Speaker 1>remained in the hands of members of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's political and military </v>

166
00:10:13.681 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 1>hierarchy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lillian Bobbia,</v>

167
00:10:15.450 --> 00:10:18.090
<v Speaker 1>professor at Bentley University in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>

168
00:10:18.210 --> 00:10:21.750
<v Speaker 1>and that's just one example and it's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>even the most important one.</v>

169
00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:22.613
<v Speaker 1>So taking all of this into account and </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it would be a good idea to </v>

170
00:10:25.351 --> 00:10:30.351
<v Speaker 1>consider some sort of military alliance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin American NATO.</v>

171
00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:40.413
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

172
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:41.393
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to propose an idea that may </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem just the touch crazy now based on </v>

173
00:10:44.911 --> 00:10:45.744
<v Speaker 1>what we've just discussed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be a good idea to think </v>

174
00:10:47.641 --> 00:10:48.474
<v Speaker 1>about building a great military alliance</v>
<v Speaker 1>and alliance in which different </v>

175
00:10:51.211 --> 00:10:55.140
<v Speaker 1>countries could organize and provide </v>
<v Speaker 1>different units and bodies for different</v>

176
00:10:55.141 --> 00:10:58.530
<v Speaker 1>types of tasks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would have several major advantage.</v>

177
00:11:01.050 --> 00:11:01.883
<v Speaker 1>Military influence over political power </v>
<v Speaker 1>would decrease and sovereignty would be </v>

178
00:11:04.681 --> 00:11:06.930
<v Speaker 1>guaranteed for all countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>addition,</v>

179
00:11:06.931 --> 00:11:09.210
<v Speaker 1>and if necessary during natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>disasters,</v>

180
00:11:09.211 --> 00:11:10.044
<v Speaker 1>Latin American countries could have an </v>
<v Speaker 1>army that could deploy rapidly where </v>

181
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:16.200
<v Speaker 1>they are needed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could also push for much needed Latin</v>

182
00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.033
<v Speaker 1>American integration and to increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>this region's role in the world of </v>

183
00:11:19.291 --> 00:11:20.124
<v Speaker 1>politics</v>

184
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.880
<v Speaker 2>x,</v>

185
00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:28.553
<v Speaker 1>it would free many resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both economic and human and this could </v>

186
00:11:31.381 --> 00:11:32.214
<v Speaker 1>be used to promote citizen security and </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce violence rates in these </v>

187
00:11:35.101 --> 00:11:35.934
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

188
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:38.790
<v Speaker 2>In a way</v>

189
00:11:38.790 --> 00:11:39.623
<v Speaker 1>the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're actually trying to do something </v>

190
00:11:40.711 --> 00:11:41.544
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while it may sound like a bit of a </v>

191
00:11:42.841 --> 00:11:45.630
<v Speaker 1>crazy idea at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it's not like crazy after all,</v>

192
00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:47.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica suppressed,</v>

193
00:11:47.401 --> 00:11:48.234
<v Speaker 1>it's all me decades ago and the results </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of security have been better </v>

194
00:11:51.090 --> 00:11:54.260
<v Speaker 1>than those of its neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've said before here on visual politic</v>

195
00:11:54.261 --> 00:11:55.094
<v Speaker 1>that the 21st century is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>India century and it's probably China </v>

196
00:11:58.241 --> 00:12:03.241
<v Speaker 1>and Asia in general.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we're wondering,</v>

197
00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:06.983
<v Speaker 1>maybe not in America too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you've heard our opinion here </v>

198
00:12:09.151 --> 00:12:10.800
<v Speaker 1>at visual politic and now it's your </v>
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>

199
00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:11.663
<v Speaker 1>Do you agree that soldiers can be used </v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace the police for matters of </v>

200
00:12:14.371 --> 00:12:15.180
<v Speaker 1>security?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
