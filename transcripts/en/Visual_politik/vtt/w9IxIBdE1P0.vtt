1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.910
<v Speaker 1>First is Spanish colony.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then in American one Puerto Rico,</v>

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:03.803
<v Speaker 1>a small islands in the Caribbean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It defines itself as a free state </v>

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:07.073
<v Speaker 1>associated with the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>Associated State who citizens have </v>

4
00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:21.950
<v Speaker 1>American citizenship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but unless they move to another state,</v>

5
00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.410
<v Speaker 1>cannot vote in the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections,</v>

6
00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:26.810
<v Speaker 1>and even though they have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative in Congress,</v>

7
00:00:26.811 --> 00:00:28.400
<v Speaker 1>he also lacks a vote.</v>

8
00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.780
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:31.700
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the major issues be they political,</v>

10
00:00:31.701 --> 00:00:32.534
<v Speaker 1>economic or military lions at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal jurisdiction of the United </v>

11
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.831
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lately,</v>

12
00:00:36.831 --> 00:00:38.750
<v Speaker 1>there's been a lot of talk about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory.</v>

13
00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:39.584
<v Speaker 1>Not only because in September of 2017 </v>
<v Speaker 1>they suffered the harsh impacts of </v>

14
00:00:42.921 --> 00:00:43.754
<v Speaker 1>Hurricane Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also because a few months before in </v>

15
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.040
<v Speaker 1>May of that same year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico declared itself bankrupts.</v>

16
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.540
<v Speaker 1>After more than 10 years of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis sweater,</v>

17
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>Rico's public accounts could no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>keep going.</v>

18
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>This is because the island's public </v>
<v Speaker 1>dense deposit is $70 billion,</v>

19
00:00:57.321 --> 00:01:01.060
<v Speaker 1>ends another $50 billion in future </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment commitments such as pensions,</v>

20
00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:01.894
<v Speaker 1>Stevia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about figures that are </v>

21
00:01:03.771 --> 00:01:04.604
<v Speaker 1>huge for an island.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The belly has more than 3 million </v>

22
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:08.990
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants because of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

23
00:01:08.991 --> 00:01:13.070
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico has become known source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>as the grease of the Caribbean.</v>

24
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.410
<v Speaker 1>The simple fact of the matter is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>

25
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:16.273
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico is insolvent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how exactly did they get to this </v>

26
00:01:20.061 --> 00:01:20.841
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

27
00:01:20.841 --> 00:01:21.674
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>

28
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.023
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

29
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.103
<v Speaker 1>let me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a lot of discussion going on </v>

30
00:01:32.381 --> 00:01:33.214
<v Speaker 1>about how to solve Puerto Rico's serious</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis and how to stop the exodus that </v>

31
00:01:36.731 --> 00:01:39.550
<v Speaker 1>the island is suffering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we saw in a previous video,</v>

32
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.350
<v Speaker 1>but first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to address this issue,</v>

33
00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.243
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to answer a question and</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's of course what I'll know if it </v>

34
00:01:45.011 --> 00:01:45.580
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

35
00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.010
<v Speaker 1>What caused pressure rico to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite soon in Sylvan?</v>

36
00:01:48.011 --> 00:01:49.960
<v Speaker 1>What led to it becoming such a broke </v>
<v Speaker 1>island?</v>

37
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.473
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the grade culprit here is the </v>

38
00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:01.334
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rican government itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government that has been spending </v>

39
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.513
<v Speaker 1>uncontrollably for decades and has many </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicions of corruption as an absolute </v>

40
00:02:08.751 --> 00:02:09.584
<v Speaker 1>disdain for production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The going beyond his Puerto Rico's </v>

41
00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:15.734
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington also holds a large amount of </v>

42
00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:22.451
<v Speaker 1>responsibility for this whole mess.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington's responsibilities.</v>

43
00:02:22.551 --> 00:02:23.384
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so great that it wouldn't be </v>

44
00:02:23.931 --> 00:02:24.764
<v Speaker 1>unreasonable to save that the federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has been the main driver of </v>

45
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:29.840
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico's bankruptcy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

46
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:30.763
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States says bombarded Puerto </v>

47
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.620
<v Speaker 1>Rico with five policies whose results </v>
<v Speaker 1>were absolutely devastating.</v>

48
00:02:36.621 --> 00:02:39.440
<v Speaker 1>Five policies concerning trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations,</v>

49
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 1>salaries and welfare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you don't believe me,</v>

50
00:02:42.141 --> 00:02:43.070
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

51
00:02:43.071 --> 00:02:43.904
<v Speaker 1>keep on listening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's free debt with this supposed </v>

52
00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.923
<v Speaker 1>intention of aiding the Puerto Rican </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and helping it's government </v>

53
00:02:58.201 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 1>access the capital markets at the dawn </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Jones Schaffrath Act,</v>

54
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:02.643
<v Speaker 1>Washington creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a triple municipal state and federal </v>

55
00:03:05.201 --> 00:03:08.020
<v Speaker 1>exemption on Puerto Rico's debts </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests.</v>

56
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.883
<v Speaker 1>Thus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any US citizen purchased Puerto </v>

57
00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.553
<v Speaker 1>Rico's public desk,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she was exempt from paying taxes </v>

58
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:15.130
<v Speaker 1>on the interest that was received.</v>

59
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.783
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if an American bought a dance from a </v>

60
00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:24.214
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to pay taxes on the returns </v>

61
00:03:25.541 --> 00:03:28.360
<v Speaker 1>that they obtained.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if he or she invested in the debt of</v>

62
00:03:28.361 --> 00:03:29.194
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico's politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he or she didn't have to pay any tax at </v>

63
00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.184
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might imagine that with such </v>

64
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.780
<v Speaker 1>attractive conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>people would be queuing up to lend money</v>

65
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.910
<v Speaker 1>to the islands governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was easy money.</v>

66
00:03:39.911 --> 00:03:43.750
<v Speaker 1>The local politicians didn't take long </v>
<v Speaker 1>to spend and it was aimed at achieving a</v>

67
00:03:43.751 --> 00:03:47.830
<v Speaker 1>single objective and that was winning or</v>
<v Speaker 1>should they really say buying votes?</v>

68
00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.693
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what better scenario could we can cox </v>

69
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.004
<v Speaker 1>for irresponsible politicians acts </v>
<v Speaker 1>engineering still logic while the </v>

70
00:04:04.211 --> 00:04:07.150
<v Speaker 1>federal government's encouraged the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island to get deeply indebted,</v>

71
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:09.850
<v Speaker 1>it also made things harder for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>private economy.</v>

72
00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 1>In 2006 Congress abolish the so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>section nine three six of the tax code,</v>

73
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.310
<v Speaker 1>a section that provided significant </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits for the companies that invested</v>

74
00:04:18.311 --> 00:04:19.144
<v Speaker 1>in the islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And let's not forget here that Puerto </v>

75
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>Rico is the poorest territory in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

76
00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:28.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that this incentive model,</v>

77
00:04:28.311 --> 00:04:30.170
<v Speaker 1>it was very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very successful,</v>

78
00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:31.033
<v Speaker 1>but years it helps Puerto Rico grow a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss even leading to it becoming a </v>

79
00:04:34.311 --> 00:04:36.590
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing and pharmaceutical </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerhouse.</v>

80
00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.033
<v Speaker 1>The ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the incentives were gone in 2006 two </v>

81
00:04:43.931 --> 00:04:46.650
<v Speaker 1>years before the great international </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis,</v>

82
00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:47.493
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico began to fall into the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>overnight to the condition of the </v>

83
00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:53.800
<v Speaker 1>companies that had been supporting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico changed drastically,</v>

84
00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.490
<v Speaker 1>forcing investments in the island to </v>
<v Speaker 1>sync legal security.</v>

85
00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:58.593
<v Speaker 1>And it was a bit of a joke,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not even close to being all </v>

86
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:06.181
<v Speaker 1>hair merchant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>marine law,</v>

87
00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.433
<v Speaker 1>maybe the most controversial points of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all and at the same time it's the most </v>

88
00:05:16.261 --> 00:05:17.880
<v Speaker 1>absurd law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Jones Act,</v>

89
00:05:17.881 --> 00:05:20.880
<v Speaker 1>which passed in 1920 and distill in </v>
<v Speaker 1>force for bids,</v>

90
00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:25.290
<v Speaker 1>foreign flag vessels from transporting </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods between two United States ports.</v>

91
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:26.153
<v Speaker 1>Thus they ship loaded with containers </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming from China cannot stop in Puerto </v>

92
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:31.450
<v Speaker 1>Rico because it has to continue on to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the mainland.</v>

93
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.050
<v Speaker 1>They're the container is destined for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico are unloaded and then loaded</v>

94
00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.830
<v Speaker 1>onto another ship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time with a US flag and crew,</v>

95
00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:38.693
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously very expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like what's the result of all of </v>

96
00:05:41.011 --> 00:05:42.020
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What Question Rico?</v>

97
00:05:42.021 --> 00:05:45.750
<v Speaker 1>It has the most expensive shipping costs</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all Caribbean countries.</v>

98
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.440
<v Speaker 1>It's something that not only industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>but also he makes exports more expensive</v>

99
00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:52.140
<v Speaker 1>and reduces every prayer to wrekin's </v>
<v Speaker 1>purchasing power.</v>

100
00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:56.490
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fax it</v>

101
00:05:56.490 --> 00:05:58.040
<v Speaker 1>to get an idea of this loss</v>

102
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.900
<v Speaker 2>implications.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We should mention that evenly.</v>

103
00:05:59.901 --> 00:06:00.734
<v Speaker 2>Puerto Rico has an average income,</v>
<v Speaker 2>approximately half of that of </v>

104
00:06:02.961 --> 00:06:06.140
<v Speaker 2>Mississippi and is poorer than any state</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the United States.</v>

105
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.020
<v Speaker 2>It's cost of living surpasses the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average state.</v>

106
00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.520
<v Speaker 2>All of this leads to a really crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>situation.</v>

107
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 1>Minimum wage and welfare policy,</v>

108
00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:23.223
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>

109
00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>full of that wasn't enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Believe me,</v>

110
00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>there is more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average salary in Puerto Rico is the</v>

111
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:32.270
<v Speaker 1>same as the federal minimum wage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is $7 and 25 cents per hour.</v>

112
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.133
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the development level and the </v>

113
00:06:35.301 --> 00:06:36.134
<v Speaker 1>average income in Puerto Rico are much </v>
<v Speaker 1>lower than those of the US states </v>

114
00:06:38.991 --> 00:06:41.360
<v Speaker 1>causing this policies distorting effects</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be,</v>

115
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:42.470
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty enormous.</v>

116
00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.973
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.600
<v Speaker 1>You see the federal minimum wage in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>York or Illinois,</v>

118
00:06:51.601 --> 00:06:52.890
<v Speaker 1>matter of fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very few people,</v>

119
00:06:52.891 --> 00:06:54.750
<v Speaker 1>but in Puerto Rico it's really </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

120
00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.613
<v Speaker 1>The federal minimum wage is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalent of 77% of the average salary </v>

121
00:06:58.561 --> 00:06:59.394
<v Speaker 1>in Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the average salary of every </v>

122
00:07:01.231 --> 00:07:03.270
<v Speaker 1>profession and every job on the island.</v>

123
00:07:06.810 --> 00:07:11.290
<v Speaker 1>This is led only one in three people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>working age to actually do so.</v>

124
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:13.710
<v Speaker 1>And if this number,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't already abnormally low,</v>

125
00:07:13.711 --> 00:07:16.560
<v Speaker 1>over a quarter of people with jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think worked for the government.</v>

126
00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:17.423
<v Speaker 1>This means that less than 25% of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island's population works in the actual </v>

127
00:07:20.970 --> 00:07:22.920
<v Speaker 1>productive economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

128
00:07:22.921 --> 00:07:26.850
<v Speaker 1>the federal regulation also implies an </v>
<v Speaker 1>abnormally high level of social benefits</v>

129
00:07:26.851 --> 00:07:28.650
<v Speaker 1>for Puerto Rico's parameters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

130
00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.513
<v Speaker 1>studies show that for many families it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is more convenient to receive social </v>

131
00:07:32.431 --> 00:07:33.264
<v Speaker 1>aids than to actually go to work because</v>
<v Speaker 1>the income they'll receive is </v>

132
00:07:36.011 --> 00:07:41.011
<v Speaker 1>substantially higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:46.064
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results of these five federal </v>

134
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:48.524
<v Speaker 1>policies has led to a huge crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a crisis that has lasted more than 10 </v>

135
00:07:52.281 --> 00:07:53.114
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has caused or has at least fuels </v>

136
00:07:54.470 --> 00:07:55.303
<v Speaker 1>the island's bankruptcy and just </v>
<v Speaker 1>generated a gigantic exodus of people </v>

137
00:07:58.640 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 1>who escaped to the consonants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially of course the youngest.</v>

138
00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:07.560
<v Speaker 1>As we saw here on visual politic in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous video,</v>

139
00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.890
<v Speaker 1>I need the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>500,000</v>

140
00:08:10.891 --> 00:08:11.724
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rican stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>packed their bags and to moved to the </v>

141
00:08:13.771 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 1>continents.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's one in every seven people.</v>

142
00:08:16.890 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 1>There's a lot of talk about how to solve</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island's problems,</v>

143
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:22.590
<v Speaker 1>but the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Puerto Rico's current connection with</v>

144
00:08:22.591 --> 00:08:25.890
<v Speaker 1>the United States compatible with any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these solutions?</v>

145
00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:26.753
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave your answer to that in the </v>

146
00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:29.490
