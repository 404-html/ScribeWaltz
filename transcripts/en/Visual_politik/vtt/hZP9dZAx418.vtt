1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>For decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing companies dominated every </v>

2
00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.943
<v Speaker 1>largest company ranking on the planet </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they weren't synonymous with </v>

3
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.660
<v Speaker 1>success and economic power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here is,</v>

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm sure it's no surprise,</v>

5
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.580
<v Speaker 1>China's huge economic takeoff in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

6
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.103
<v Speaker 1>I take over.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has a lot to do with the </v>

7
00:00:19.021 --> 00:00:21.870
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to it.</v>

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.460
<v Speaker 1>So far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the 21st century,</v>

9
00:00:23.461 --> 00:00:28.040
<v Speaker 1>the Asian giants is multiplied its </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports by 10 rising from just $257,</v>

10
00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.510
<v Speaker 1>billions more than two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$4,000,000,000,000.</v>

11
00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.810
<v Speaker 1>That's why when we think about China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>about the Chinese economy,</v>

12
00:00:38.811 --> 00:00:39.644
<v Speaker 1>it's very easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the images of a smoke filled country </v>

13
00:00:41.721 --> 00:00:42.554
<v Speaker 1>full of huge dirty factories with </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of workers </v>

14
00:00:45.471 --> 00:00:46.304
<v Speaker 1>making all kinds of junk for miserable </v>
<v Speaker 1>salaries to come to mind and you know </v>

15
00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:51.710
<v Speaker 1>what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To be honest,</v>

16
00:00:51.711 --> 00:00:54.260
<v Speaker 1>when you first step into China for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time,</v>

17
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.180
<v Speaker 1>you realize that you probably weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrong.</v>

18
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.210
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just because this is the China,</v>

19
00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.230
<v Speaker 1>we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's no longer the only China.</v>

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.090
<v Speaker 1>Before we continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I got a question for you.</v>

21
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.570
<v Speaker 1>What would you say is the biggest video </v>
<v Speaker 1>game company in the world?</v>

22
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.660
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about it in several videos.</v>

23
00:01:20.281 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>China is changing out full speed every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

24
00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.443
<v Speaker 1>Millions and millions of people leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty behind to become part of the </v>

25
00:01:27.061 --> 00:01:28.260
<v Speaker 1>middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

26
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.153
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to focus on a slightly</v>
<v Speaker 1>different aspects on one of the sectors </v>

27
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.173
<v Speaker 1>that's changing the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that may be quite surprising </v>

28
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:37.194
<v Speaker 1>to many of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about China's digital </v>

29
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

30
00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.360
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

31
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.560
<v Speaker 1>the country of cheap stuff is quickly </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a technological giants,</v>

32
00:01:51.561 --> 00:01:54.230
<v Speaker 1>and the truth is that in terms of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital terrain,</v>

33
00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>in many ways it's even ahead of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>western powers.</v>

34
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.010
<v Speaker 1>Don't believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:00.840
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look for example of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening with economy.</v>

36
00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.633
<v Speaker 1>Just a decade ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's share and the global ecommerce </v>

37
00:02:05.921 --> 00:02:07.930
<v Speaker 1>market was less than one percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

38
00:02:07.931 --> 00:02:08.764
<v Speaker 1>almost half 42 percent of all ECOMMERCE </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions on the planet come from </v>

39
00:02:13.421 --> 00:02:15.940
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea of what this means,</v>

40
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:16.774
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated that China's ecommerce </v>
<v Speaker 1>market is already greater than those of </v>

41
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:21.010
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

42
00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.720
<v Speaker 1>the United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

43
00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.840
<v Speaker 1>and the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>s combined surprised.</v>

44
00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:28.910
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be.</v>

45
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.730
<v Speaker 1>China's digital economy is growing at </v>
<v Speaker 1>four speeds,</v>

46
00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.623
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not exaggerating here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to the China Academy of </v>

47
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.130
<v Speaker 1>Information and communications </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

48
00:02:37.131 --> 00:02:37.964
<v Speaker 1>you have already agreed to it in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ministry of Industry and Information </v>

49
00:02:39.891 --> 00:02:41.450
<v Speaker 1>Technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the digital economy,</v>

50
00:02:41.451 --> 00:02:42.284
<v Speaker 1>you could already account for 30 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the entire Chinese economy because </v>

51
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:47.053
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about ecommerce.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The number of Internet users in China </v>

52
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.280
<v Speaker 1>exceeds 700 million people more than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet users in the European Union and</v>

53
00:02:56.151 --> 00:03:01.151
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:04.981 --> 00:03:05.814
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know they have many more inhabitants </v>

55
00:03:07.631 --> 00:03:08.464
<v Speaker 1>and in fact the internet expansion rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>is still lower in China than in Europe </v>

56
00:03:11.921 --> 00:03:12.754
<v Speaker 1>or the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just think about that market sites </v>

57
00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:16.063
<v Speaker 1>that is used magnets years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the 700 million people is a lot of </v>

58
00:03:19.031 --> 00:03:20.410
<v Speaker 1>people and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>

59
00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.303
<v Speaker 1>You may have all heard about the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>firewall with which the Chinese </v>

60
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.520
<v Speaker 1>government sends us a lot of services </v>
<v Speaker 1>and websites such as Google,</v>

61
00:03:27.521 --> 00:03:28.630
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or youtube</v>

62
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.523
<v Speaker 2>issue.</v>

63
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.560
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>

64
00:03:33.561 --> 00:03:34.394
<v Speaker 1>that firewall does exist and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unfortunately the Chinese government </v>

65
00:03:36.921 --> 00:03:37.754
<v Speaker 1>exerts see huge amounts of censorship on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the information that Chinese citizens </v>

66
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:43.130
<v Speaker 1>can access,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite this,</v>

67
00:03:43.131 --> 00:03:43.964
<v Speaker 1>the Internet is the Internet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not all that surprising to </v>

68
00:03:46.761 --> 00:03:47.594
<v Speaker 1>realize that the use of vpn networks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bypass government control rates is not </v>

69
00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.580
<v Speaker 1>exactly low in China and besides </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything that isn't,</v>

70
00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.960
<v Speaker 1>politics does kind of work with enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

71
00:03:56.961 --> 00:03:57.794
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Beijing government itself promotes </v>

72
00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Speaker 1>the development of the Internet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>digital economy as a national priority.</v>

73
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:09.403
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the truth is that the Chinese are </v>

74
00:04:10.401 --> 00:04:11.234
<v Speaker 1>very receptive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost passionate about the new digital </v>

75
00:04:13.851 --> 00:04:14.870
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

76
00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.510
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than half of all events tickets are</v>

77
00:04:17.511 --> 00:04:20.300
<v Speaker 1>sold through digital channels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's more surprising,</v>

78
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:25.220
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated that more than 45 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all retailers sell over the Internet.</v>

79
00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.830
<v Speaker 1>And other good example can be found in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fintech sector.</v>

80
00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.590
<v Speaker 1>That is financial technology services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen to them.</v>

81
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:39.170
<v Speaker 2>According</v>

82
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:40.003
<v Speaker 1>the consulting firm I research in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mobile payments in China were worth </v>

83
00:04:44.101 --> 00:04:44.934
<v Speaker 1>about five point $5,000,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately 50 times the United </v>

84
00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.030
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>$112,000,000,000</v>

85
00:04:51.031 --> 00:04:51.840
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

86
00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:54.330
<v Speaker 1>this isn't just about Fintech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not adult,</v>

87
00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that China has begun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>play a part in almost every sector.</v>

88
00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>It's very unlikely that in the upcoming </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

89
00:05:00.391 --> 00:05:01.224
<v Speaker 1>many of the greatest digital and </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological innovations will be born </v>

90
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:04.793
<v Speaker 1>right here in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a second because don't think </v>

91
00:05:06.691 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 1>that this is just some vision of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>

92
00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:10.590
<v Speaker 1>It's actually happening right now,</v>

93
00:05:16.540 --> 00:05:17.373
<v Speaker 1>almost one in three Unicorns,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is what startups valued at more </v>

94
00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.423
<v Speaker 1>than a billion dollars on known as his </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese one in three in the entire </v>

95
00:05:24.161 --> 00:05:24.994
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about more than 75 </v>

96
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:29.080
<v Speaker 1>companies like the ones you're seeing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the screen now.</v>

97
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Now you may not have heard of many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>

98
00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.523
<v Speaker 1>but actually now that I think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably haven't heard of most of </v>

99
00:05:33.671 --> 00:05:34.451
<v Speaker 1>them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but folks,</v>

100
00:05:34.451 --> 00:05:35.284
<v Speaker 1>they all have something in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these companies are worth more </v>

101
00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:41.830
<v Speaker 1>than a billion American dollars and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all Chinese.</v>

102
00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:42.723
<v Speaker 1>These companies are all expected to play</v>
<v Speaker 1>a strong role in the world of </v>

103
00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:45.820
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

104
00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.770
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

105
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea of the type of </v>
<v Speaker 1>company we're talking about,</v>

106
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:54.520
<v Speaker 1>we'll mention the company on this list </v>
<v Speaker 1>that most of you probably know.</v>

107
00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:57.743
<v Speaker 1>I'm about Dji,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's leader in commercial </v>

108
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:00.713
<v Speaker 1>drainages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you know the spark that now the </v>

109
00:06:01.871 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>care,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Mavic pro.</v>

110
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:05.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the company that makes those things</v>

111
00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>along with them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

112
00:06:08.781 --> 00:06:10.910
<v Speaker 1>is the group of big players,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alibaba,</v>

113
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:11.900
<v Speaker 1>tencent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Baidu,</v>

114
00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:12.990
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Huawei,</v>

115
00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.120
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

116
00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.003
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that silicon valley has a </v>

117
00:06:16.521 --> 00:06:18.410
<v Speaker 1>new and powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>

118
00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.320
<v Speaker 1>so allow me to repeat the question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked at the beginning of the video.</v>

119
00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:27.830
<v Speaker 1>What would you say is the biggest video </v>
<v Speaker 1>game company in the world?</v>

120
00:06:27.890 --> 00:06:28.723
<v Speaker 1>Maybe a French company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe a company located in Silicon </v>

121
00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.850
<v Speaker 1>Valley?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nope,</v>

122
00:06:31.850 --> 00:06:32.683
<v Speaker 1>none of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The largest video game company in the </v>

123
00:06:33.741 --> 00:06:37.160
<v Speaker 1>world is ten cent Nasoni non intended.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Microsoft,</v>

124
00:06:37.220 --> 00:06:39.900
<v Speaker 1>but tencent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

125
00:06:39.901 --> 00:06:43.400
<v Speaker 1>even though the company's main business </v>
<v Speaker 1>has nothing to do with video games,</v>

126
00:06:43.401 --> 00:06:44.234
<v Speaker 1>the company is best known for we chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This company makes more than </v>

127
00:06:46.581 --> 00:06:47.414
<v Speaker 1>$16,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>worth of video games each year and </v>

128
00:06:49.971 --> 00:06:53.810
<v Speaker 1>controls more than 10 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world wide video game industry.</v>

129
00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:54.643
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

130
00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.550
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard of League of Legends</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clash Royale or candy crush?</v>

131
00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to some extent they're controlled by </v>

132
00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:03.780
<v Speaker 1>this Chinese company surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>you shouldn't be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the best example we can find.</v>

134
00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:07.253
<v Speaker 1>The digital and technological revolution</v>
<v Speaker 1>that China is undergoing exists in what </v>

135
00:07:10.681 --> 00:07:15.681
<v Speaker 1>is already known as the Silicon Delta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out the Pearl River Delta,</v>

136
00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:28.600
<v Speaker 1>the Pearl River Delta has become one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most important economic poles on the</v>

137
00:07:28.601 --> 00:07:31.000
<v Speaker 1>planet here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we can find some of the engines that</v>

138
00:07:31.001 --> 00:07:31.834
<v Speaker 1>explained the impressive growth of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>region of the world has had in recent </v>

139
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:35.261
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among others.</v>

140
00:07:35.261 --> 00:07:37.360
<v Speaker 1>The delta contains places like Hong </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kong,</v>

141
00:07:37.361 --> 00:07:38.890
<v Speaker 1>Macau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fascia and Guangzhou,</v>

142
00:07:38.891 --> 00:07:39.724
<v Speaker 1>and Shenzhen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While it's precisely Shen Zen's case </v>

143
00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.230
<v Speaker 1>that can explain what's happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this part of the world.</v>

144
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:45.123
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shenzen is a city of more than 12 </v>

145
00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:49.630
<v Speaker 1>million people whose economy has just </v>
<v Speaker 1>surpassed that of Hong Kong.</v>

146
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:54.580
<v Speaker 2>What</v>

147
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:55.413
<v Speaker 1>just three decades ago was no more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>a fishing village has become a global </v>

148
00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:59.793
<v Speaker 1>technology epicenter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea of what we're </v>

149
00:08:02.021 --> 00:08:02.854
<v Speaker 1>talking about every single year this </v>
<v Speaker 1>city registers more international </v>

150
00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:08.170
<v Speaker 1>Peyton's than France or the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom.</v>

151
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.790
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ten cent was born here,</v>

152
00:08:09.791 --> 00:08:10.624
<v Speaker 1>the company that owns we chat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leading messaging application in </v>

153
00:08:12.911 --> 00:08:16.840
<v Speaker 1>China and which you can do practically </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything with in this application.</v>

154
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:17.733
<v Speaker 1>You can even find real time thermal maps</v>
<v Speaker 1>that show you how busy or shopping </v>

155
00:08:20.201 --> 00:08:23.590
<v Speaker 1>center is at that very moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just 30 years ago,</v>

156
00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.513
<v Speaker 1>this Pearl River,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Delta megacity was a mere fishing </v>

157
00:08:27.131 --> 00:08:30.490
<v Speaker 1>village now home to up to 15 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

158
00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:34.780
<v Speaker 1>It hopes to become a tech nirvana for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's hardware startups.</v>

159
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:35.763
<v Speaker 1>The fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is 1979 when Shen Zen became the </v>

160
00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:38.824
<v Speaker 1>first special economic zone of China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The city's economy has grown as an </v>

161
00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.633
<v Speaker 1>annual average rate of around 22 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>today as development in growth are </v>

162
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:49.960
<v Speaker 1>mainly led by digital and technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

163
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.693
<v Speaker 1>It's companies like royal that aspires </v>
<v Speaker 1>to become the world's leader in folding </v>

164
00:08:55.170 --> 00:08:56.003
<v Speaker 1>touchscreens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that's considered </v>

165
00:08:56.880 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>indispensable for the future of </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications.</v>

166
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.433
<v Speaker 1>Because folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can already see it and you China is </v>

167
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:04.704
<v Speaker 1>emerging.</v>

168
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:09.303

169
00:09:11.291 --> 00:09:13.420
<v Speaker 1>country and of course that's a good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

170
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:14.293
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley needs some competition </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that means that in the next few </v>

171
00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:17.613
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pace of technological development </v>

172
00:09:18.461 --> 00:09:20.470
<v Speaker 1>will accelerate more and more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

173
