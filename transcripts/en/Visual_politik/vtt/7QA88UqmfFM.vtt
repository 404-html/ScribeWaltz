<v Speaker 1>partly flagship brands of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporation is definitely Zara.</v>

22

<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you know it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's our stores open in almost every </v>

<v Speaker 1>country around the world and it is here </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Zuora where the corporation makes 60 </v>

24
00:01:21.741 --> 00:01:22.574
<v Speaker 1>percent of its total sales for the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>striking thing here is not just the </v>

25
00:01:25.581 --> 00:01:27.530
<v Speaker 1>figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the company's evolution.</v>

26
00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.393
<v Speaker 1>It just a few years into Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>turns into the world's largest textile </v>

00:01:31.191 --> 00:01:32.024
<v Speaker 1>group with stores on the most expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets in the world and it all started </v>

28
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.040
<v Speaker 1>as a modest Spanish</v>

29
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 2>in a.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

30
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.240
<v Speaker 1>kind of thing might be less unusual in a</v>
<v Speaker 1>country like the USA,</v>

31
00:01:50.241 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 1>but I can assure you it's ratified in </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a phenomenon in Spain.</v>

32
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:54.793
<v Speaker 1>That is why we're going to analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>interjects today from its humble </v>

33
00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 1>beginnings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>through the keys to its success,</v>

34
00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:00.730
<v Speaker 1>and of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

35
00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:02.150
<v Speaker 1>it's immense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Profits,</v>

36
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.650
<v Speaker 1>origins of a giant.</v>

37
00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.330
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The</v>

38
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.163
<v Speaker 1>origins of insects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We must go back to the seventies when </v>

39
00:02:18.181 --> 00:02:22.410
<v Speaker 1>Spanish businessmen that Amancio Ortega </v>
<v Speaker 1>opens the first Zara store.</v>

40
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.303
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where did Ortega get the inspiration to </v>

41
00:02:25.231 --> 00:02:29.810
<v Speaker 1>start out such a profitable moneymaker?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:30.713
<v Speaker 1>it's difficult to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we do know this man has been </v>

43
00:02:32.551 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>involved with the fashion industry from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a very young age.</v>

44
00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>When he was only 14,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was already working as a delivery boy</v>

45
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:42.780
<v Speaker 1>for a well known shirt shop in a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial city in the north of Spain.</v>

46
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.820
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Times have absolutely changed.</v>

47
00:02:44.821 --> 00:02:45.654
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain was very different to how it is </v>

48
00:02:47.161 --> 00:02:47.994
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a much poorer country and it </v>

49
00:02:49.141 --> 00:02:52.200
<v Speaker 1>wasn't unusual to find a 14 year olds in</v>
<v Speaker 1>employment,</v>

50
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.443
<v Speaker 1>but let's focus it on the thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ortega sort was a clear business </v>

51
00:02:57.151 --> 00:02:57.984
<v Speaker 1>opportunity and he seemed designed it to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make his mark on the international </v>

52
00:03:00.851 --> 00:03:02.350
<v Speaker 1>market in 1988.</v>

53
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.780
<v Speaker 1>He opened his first store outside </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish,</v>

54
00:03:04.781 --> 00:03:05.614
<v Speaker 1>borders in Porto in Portugal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon after he crossed the Atlantic and </v>

55
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.220
<v Speaker 1>set foot in New York and he has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>unstoppable since then.</v>

56
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>The UK,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan,</v>

57
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
<v Speaker 1>Kuwait.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right now you can find an intersect </v>

58
00:03:15.881 --> 00:03:20.881
<v Speaker 1>store in almost every large city in </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital city in the world into tanks,</v>

59
00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.090
<v Speaker 1>brand owner of Zara and plans to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>stores in Vietnam,</v>

60
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paraguay of Aruba and Nicaragua.</v>

61
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
<v Speaker 1>This year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the voice of Vietnam today into it says </v>

62
00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:33.520
<v Speaker 1>more than 7,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300 stores across the globe.</v>

63
00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:34.383
<v Speaker 1>It's made markets were Intersex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has more shops outside Spain that in </v>

64
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:39.170
<v Speaker 1>China and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>

65
00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.050
<v Speaker 1>all of there's international expansion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:41.051 --> 00:03:41.884
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly had a reward or take it </v>
<v Speaker 1>to that child who saw no other choice </v>

67
00:03:45.551 --> 00:03:49.270
<v Speaker 1>but to work to survive and do founded </v>
<v Speaker 1>into tax when he was almost 40.</v>

68
00:03:49.271 --> 00:03:52.090
<v Speaker 1>Is today one of the wealthiest people on</v>
<v Speaker 1>Earth.</v>

69
00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.953
<v Speaker 1>According to Forbes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ortega's fortune is more than </v>

70
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:59.230
<v Speaker 1>$55,000,000,000 and well there is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollar question.</v>

71
00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.610
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how did he do it?</v>

72
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at that.</v>

73
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.840
<v Speaker 1>Keys to success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you say that innovation is limited to</v>

74
00:04:13.081 --> 00:04:14.790
<v Speaker 1>the realms of the high tech industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:14.791 --> 00:04:15.624
<v Speaker 1>you probably don't know about into tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pay attention here because we're </v>

76
00:04:17.911 --> 00:04:18.744
<v Speaker 1>going to look at how this company has </v>
<v Speaker 1>turned the entire textile industry </v>

77
00:04:21.691 --> 00:04:25.770
<v Speaker 1>upside down by competing in a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different way to rival company</v>

78
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.033
<v Speaker 1>for textile industry thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't exactly sound incredibly </v>

79
00:04:32.291 --> 00:04:34.990
<v Speaker 1>groundbreaking does it as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This company,</v>

80
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.883
<v Speaker 1>they've achieved immense growth growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>which can mainly be attributed to </v>

81
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:40.263
<v Speaker 1>innovation like daring to be different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's analyze in depth some of the </v>

82
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:46.330
<v Speaker 1>keys to business success first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

83
00:04:46.331 --> 00:04:48.430
<v Speaker 1>we need to pay attention to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company's brain.</v>

84
00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:49.293
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interface does have some sort of brain </v>

85
00:04:50.351 --> 00:04:53.530
<v Speaker 1>and this is the operation room that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company established in our t show.</v>

86
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.730
<v Speaker 1>A small town in Galicia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you could be forgiven for mistaking.</v>

87
00:04:57.731 --> 00:05:01.360
<v Speaker 1>This is some sort of NASA control room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at least for now,</v>

88
00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.390
<v Speaker 1>no rockets or satellites have managed </v>
<v Speaker 1>from here in this room.</v>

89
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:08.500
<v Speaker 1>They control and analyze everything that</v>
<v Speaker 1>takes place across all of the companies.</v>

90
00:05:08.501 --> 00:05:10.320
<v Speaker 1>Stores can real time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

91
00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:13.870
<v Speaker 1>even though a large part of the clothing</v>
<v Speaker 1>production takes place in countries like</v>

92
00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:14.800
<v Speaker 1>Morocco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkey,</v>

93
00:05:14.801 --> 00:05:15.910
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Bangladesh,</v>

94
00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:16.773
<v Speaker 1>everything or almost everything goes </v>
<v Speaker 1>through Spain before it is sent to </v>

95
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.130
<v Speaker 1>stores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

96
00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.530
<v Speaker 1>let's think about a Zara store in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Shanghai.</v>

97
00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.423
<v Speaker 1>It would be logical for us to think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the clothes are made in </v>

98
00:05:26.291 --> 00:05:27.124
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they should be sent directly to </v>

99
00:05:28.721 --> 00:05:30.130
<v Speaker 1>China from that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>

100
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.930
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not what happens at all.</v>

101
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>They're actually taken to Spain and then</v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent back to Asia.</v>

102
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.760
<v Speaker 1>This might seem counterintuitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does have an explanation.</v>

103
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:43.410
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

104
00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.370
<v Speaker 1>Shops sell the same quantity of each </v>
<v Speaker 1>type of clothing.</v>

105
00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Speaker 1>The purpose of this operation is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>control how much is sold and what's kind</v>

106
00:05:50.511 --> 00:05:52.550
<v Speaker 1>of thesis are sent to each of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

107
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:53.570
<v Speaker 1>shops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the model,</v>

108
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.620
<v Speaker 1>the color,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the size,</v>

109
00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:55.140
<v Speaker 1>et.</v>

110
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:55.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

111
00:05:58.790 --> 00:06:01.670
<v Speaker 1>Considering this data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stores receive pieces of clothing as</v>

112
00:06:01.671 --> 00:06:04.760
<v Speaker 1>appropriate for that individual needs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is only logical,</v>

113
00:06:04.761 --> 00:06:05.594
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Zara on Fifth Avenue of does </v>

114
00:06:07.101 --> 00:06:07.934
<v Speaker 1>not sell the same items that the Zara's </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Miami beach or I bet key to success </v>

115
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.633
<v Speaker 1>is logistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is closely related to the first </v>

116
00:06:16.651 --> 00:06:19.650
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intersect supplies its doors two or even</v>

117
00:06:19.651 --> 00:06:20.484
<v Speaker 1>three times a week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they can deliver to any of their </v>

118
00:06:22.291 --> 00:06:23.124
<v Speaker 1>stores in just 48 hours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can imagine what's in it for this </v>

119
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:27.840
<v Speaker 1>requires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with this time in the company,</v>

120
00:06:27.841 --> 00:06:28.674
<v Speaker 1>it gets several things in return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They reduce stock in storage and reduce </v>

121
00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:32.514
<v Speaker 1>the storage space required in the shops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less dark means less money and less </v>

122
00:06:36.331 --> 00:06:38.760
<v Speaker 1>storage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Space means more space for sale.</v>

123
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:45.460
<v Speaker 1>In all of this means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well of course that means more money.</v>

124
00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.353
<v Speaker 1>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it also helps to have an updated sales </v>

125
00:06:48.011 --> 00:06:49.220
<v Speaker 1>line,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this by the way,</v>

126
00:06:49.250 --> 00:06:54.250
<v Speaker 1>is the third key to into Texas success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No more lasting collections</v>

127
00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.953
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The clothes aren't often renewed on </v>

128
00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:03.990
<v Speaker 1>average every fortnight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so dive Teesha is not selling.</v>

129
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.440
<v Speaker 1>It's out just like that in finishes from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the shelves and never to be seen again.</v>

130
00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.600
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a piece of clothing is selling well,</v>

131
00:07:09.601 --> 00:07:13.110
<v Speaker 1>the customer knows he won't find many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people wearing the same products because</v>

132
00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.440
<v Speaker 1>it's production is limited to a short </v>
<v Speaker 1>period of time,</v>

133
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:18.570
<v Speaker 1>so when something is popular in itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well,</v>

134
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:20.820
<v Speaker 1>the company doesn't provide more of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these items.</v>

135
00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:23.730
<v Speaker 1>What the designers do is they sort of </v>
<v Speaker 1>recycle the model.</v>

136
00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:24.623
<v Speaker 1>The essence is kept,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some modifications are made so they </v>

137
00:07:27.691 --> 00:07:30.210
<v Speaker 1>follow the trend,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they don't repeat it.</v>

138
00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.060
<v Speaker 1>It all explains why every time we walk </v>
<v Speaker 1>into one of these shops,</v>

139
00:07:33.061 --> 00:07:36.480
<v Speaker 1>most of what we see is different to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>products we saw the last time.</v>

140
00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:39.090
<v Speaker 1>So to sum up with the operation room,</v>
<v Speaker 1>daily analysis,</v>

141
00:07:39.091 --> 00:07:40.470
<v Speaker 1>logistics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new designs,</v>

142
00:07:40.471 --> 00:07:41.304
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this company is starting to not sound </v>

143
00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:44.100
<v Speaker 1>that traditional,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>

144
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:47.460
<v Speaker 1>But I'm sure you probably want to know </v>
<v Speaker 1>more about those huge figures.</v>

145
00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:47.941
<v Speaker 1>Say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

146
00:07:47.941 --> 00:07:52.941
<v Speaker 1>let's jump into that now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The large figures,</v>

147
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:02.413
<v Speaker 1>if there weren't three words to define </v>
<v Speaker 1>this enormous player of the fashion </v>

148
00:08:05.241 --> 00:08:07.400
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these would be well growth,</v>

149
00:08:07.401 --> 00:08:08.270
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

150
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.104
<v Speaker 1>the third word would also be growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we've discussed the main keys that </v>

151
00:08:11.571 --> 00:08:12.404
<v Speaker 1>have helped to build this empire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's see what's going on within </v>

152
00:08:15.141 --> 00:08:15.974
<v Speaker 1>the company and to do this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we need to take a look at the periods </v>

153
00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:18.743
<v Speaker 1>between 2006 and 2016 and only 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>into text has been able to multiply </v>

154
00:08:25.881 --> 00:08:28.970
<v Speaker 1>their sales by three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've doubled the number of stores and</v>

155
00:08:28.971 --> 00:08:33.971
<v Speaker 1>they've expanded to 50 new countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not so bad for just 10 years.</v>

156
00:08:35.571 --> 00:08:36.321
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

157
00:08:36.321 --> 00:08:38.690
<v Speaker 1>in previous videos like the one we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Amazon,</v>

158
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:42.170
<v Speaker 1>we said we'd like to highlight the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>money company generates.</v>

159
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:43.063
<v Speaker 1>That is the difference between the money</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comes in and the money that goes </v>

160
00:08:45.381 --> 00:08:47.300
<v Speaker 1>out the cash flow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

161
00:08:47.330 --> 00:08:48.163
<v Speaker 1>if we do it again for Inditex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see the cash flow has multiplied </v>

162
00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:54.350
<v Speaker 1>by three in the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the numbers,</v>

163
00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:55.213
<v Speaker 1>we see how this real profit has gone </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one point 4 billion euros to 4 </v>

164
00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.010
<v Speaker 1>billion euros every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

165
00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:02.873
<v Speaker 1>Mr Ortega System,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly works and this does not </v>

166
00:09:06.001 --> 00:09:06.834
<v Speaker 1>just work great for shareholders because</v>
<v Speaker 1>inditex has been an absolute employment </v>

167
00:09:10.501 --> 00:09:13.140
<v Speaker 1>machine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This company now has more than a hundred</v>

168
00:09:13.141 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>and 60,000 workers around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the end of it,</v>

169
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:17.573
<v Speaker 1>not even close because if we bear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind all the suppliers that inditex </v>

170
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.383
<v Speaker 1>works with,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that number could be in excess of a </v>

171
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:24.893
<v Speaker 1>million workers,</v>

172
00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:30.583
<v Speaker 1>million people that in one way or </v>
<v Speaker 1>another have a drama because of a </v>

173
00:09:32.711 --> 00:09:33.544
<v Speaker 1>company that was born in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventies in a small city in the north </v>

174
00:09:36.581 --> 00:09:37.414
<v Speaker 1>of Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a company that was founded by a humble </v>

175
00:09:39.251 --> 00:09:41.080
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a worker with ambition.</v>

176
00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:41.993
<v Speaker 1>It's all variable.</v>

177
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:47.593
<v Speaker 1>I.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is why would Tayga has become an </v>

178
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.960
<v Speaker 1>idol for many young Spanish school </v>
<v Speaker 1>students.</v>

179
00:09:50.961 --> 00:09:53.300
<v Speaker 1>They aspire to be like him when they </v>
<v Speaker 1>grow up.</v>

180
00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:54.913
<v Speaker 1>Spanish high school students want to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a month ago or take a in the </v>

181
00:09:58.161 --> 00:09:59.000
<v Speaker 1>future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

182
00:09:59.030 --> 00:09:59.863
<v Speaker 1>now I see all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you often find yourself shopping in </v>

183
00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 1>stores even though maybe it never heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>of it before?</v>

184
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.780
<v Speaker 1>I'm wants your opinion on Ortega.</v>
