00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.833
<v Speaker 1>Many of you may have experienced doubts </v>
<v Speaker 1>about certain future technological </v>

2
00:00:12.711 --> 00:00:13.544
<v Speaker 1>advancements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean don't deny it's a fear of </v>

3
00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.760
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of artificial intelligence,</v>

4
00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:20.120
<v Speaker 1>of autonomous cars or factories with our</v>
<v Speaker 1>work as a smart robots,</v>

5
00:00:20.121 --> 00:00:22.760
<v Speaker 1>it's totally fine if I think of odd jobs</v>
<v Speaker 1>being taken away.</v>

6
00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:25.190
<v Speaker 1>If a few gaining power at the expense of</v>
<v Speaker 1>others,</v>

7
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.083
<v Speaker 1>inequalities multiplying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's even machines controlling us and </v>

8
00:00:28.611 --> 00:00:30.950
<v Speaker 1>taking over the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's scary stuff.</v>

9
00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.030
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm an adult.</v>

10
00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 2>I always pickwick,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no enemy and this boy my arm.</v>

11
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.560
<v Speaker 1>It's like kind of machines really </v>
<v Speaker 1>replace human beings.</v>

12
00:00:45.561 --> 00:00:46.394
<v Speaker 1>Could they really manage to teach </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves and take control of </v>

13
00:00:48.921 --> 00:00:49.754
<v Speaker 1>civilization?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What role are people going to play in a </v>

14
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:00.684
<v Speaker 1>world of intelligent machines folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this fear of change of the unknown of </v>

15
00:01:04.291 --> 00:01:05.124
<v Speaker 1>the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has it become something like our own </v>

16
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.853
<v Speaker 1>21st century Phantom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fanzine that is now moving all around </v>

17
00:01:11.281 --> 00:01:12.900
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although you know what?</v>

18
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.760
<v Speaker 1>Truthfully,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing new.</v>

19
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.920
<v Speaker 1>The relationship between human beings </v>
<v Speaker 1>and machines,</v>

20
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:19.350
<v Speaker 1>it's never been simple.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is always awakened.</v>

21
00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:20.213
<v Speaker 1>Mixed Feeling,</v>

22
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.853
<v Speaker 3>oh go has landed cause that the same </v>
<v Speaker 3>noise you heard when you signed your </v>

23
00:01:30.211 --> 00:01:31.330
<v Speaker 3>sportswear contract.</v>

24
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.600
<v Speaker 1>Fair them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's others.</v>

25
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.443
<v Speaker 1>Even as an opportunity for progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are those who view them with </v>

26
00:01:37.641 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>distrust and those who view them as </v>
<v Speaker 1>great allies,</v>

27
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.143
<v Speaker 1>and of course there are always those who</v>
<v Speaker 1>predicted that because of all these </v>

28
00:01:43.101 --> 00:01:45.740
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of humanity is getting nearer.</v>

29
00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:46.790
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we can send you,</v>

30
00:01:46.791 --> 00:01:47.624
<v Speaker 1>what group do you belong to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you let me know in the comments below </v>

31
00:01:49.491 --> 00:01:51.890
<v Speaker 1>and also we've got a survey about it at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the end of the video.</v>

32
00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:54.260
<v Speaker 1>So check that out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course along with all these fairs</v>

33
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:55.094
<v Speaker 1>are the typical contradictions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>always arise just because the machines </v>

34
00:02:00.381 --> 00:02:01.214
<v Speaker 1>take our jobs and at the same time we </v>
<v Speaker 1>complain about the mundane and </v>

35
00:02:03.681 --> 00:02:06.560
<v Speaker 1>exhausting jobs to which many employees </v>
<v Speaker 1>are subjected,</v>

36
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.260
<v Speaker 1>especially the least qualified ones or </v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

37
00:02:09.261 --> 00:02:10.094
<v Speaker 1>another very typical contradiction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost every day we hear union leaders </v>

38
00:02:12.771 --> 00:02:13.604
<v Speaker 1>demanding a shorter work day while at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time rejecting or wanting to </v>

39
00:02:16.581 --> 00:02:17.414
<v Speaker 1>hold technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you know would actually lead to </v>

40
00:02:19.521 --> 00:02:20.430
<v Speaker 1>that shorter work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

41
00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:23.230
<v Speaker 4>Then</v>

42
00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.063
<v Speaker 1>there's one of my favorites.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many politicians continually denounce </v>

43
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.433
<v Speaker 1>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low purchasing power while they place </v>

44
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.040
<v Speaker 1>obstacles and even pro habits </v>
<v Speaker 1>technologies that increased productivity</v>

45
00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.933
<v Speaker 1>and lower prices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you've thought about the taxi </v>

46
00:02:35.501 --> 00:02:36.334
<v Speaker 1>sector runs platforms like Uber.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We at visual politics certainly half of </v>

47
00:02:39.161 --> 00:02:41.800
<v Speaker 1>course to view it in the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>adapting to new changes.</v>

48
00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.653
<v Speaker 1>It tends to be just a matter of time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know a single person who worries </v>

49
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.360
<v Speaker 1>about jobs that have disappeared because</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mobile phones?</v>

50
00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.253
<v Speaker 1>Do you know anyone who wants to ban </v>
<v Speaker 1>electric power because it can hard to </v>

51
00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.700
<v Speaker 1>candle factory workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's true.</v>

52
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:55.563
<v Speaker 1>As we mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the arrival of artificial intelligence </v>

53
00:02:57.971 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>has led to some questions and some new </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>

54
00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:04.360
<v Speaker 1>but before we talk all about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's look back at the history.</v>

55
00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.913
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

56
00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.550
<v Speaker 1>Fear of change.</v>

57
00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.063
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

58
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.323
<v Speaker 1>The political speeches we hear everyday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they pose nothing new and the lungs </v>

59
00:03:21.081 --> 00:03:24.890
<v Speaker 1>raised about technological changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They come directly from such speeches.</v>

60
00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:25.783
<v Speaker 1>Seek from the very beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the time human beings lived in </v>

61
00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:29.324
<v Speaker 1>caves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>humanity has progressed thanks to the </v>

62
00:03:31.371 --> 00:03:36.020
<v Speaker 1>use of tools together to cultivate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you conserve food,</v>

63
00:03:36.021 --> 00:03:39.260
<v Speaker 1>ought to improve productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's all because of tools.</v>

64
00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:42.200
<v Speaker 1>Tools have given us the chance to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve better lives.</v>

65
00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:43.160
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays,</v>

66
00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.150
<v Speaker 1>community is experiencing the greatest </v>
<v Speaker 1>welfare and all of its history.</v>

67
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.023
<v Speaker 4>Sure.</v>

68
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.340
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during a particular moment in history,</v>

69
00:03:51.341 --> 00:03:55.120
<v Speaker 1>tools and machines became something like</v>
<v Speaker 1>an enemy to be beaten,</v>

70
00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.073
<v Speaker 1>at least for a certain part of society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're of course talking about the time </v>

71
00:03:59.201 --> 00:04:00.034
<v Speaker 1>of the industrial revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is despite the fact that the </v>

72
00:04:02.171 --> 00:04:06.810
<v Speaker 1>industrial revolution meant a huge leap </v>
<v Speaker 1>in terms of welfare for billions of,</v>

73
00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.050
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does that at the time,</v>

74
00:04:11.051 --> 00:04:15.150
<v Speaker 1>machines began to be used widely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Protests against them multiplied and its</v>

75
00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:18.940
<v Speaker 1>movements of all kinds emerged against </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of new technologies.</v>

76
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.090
<v Speaker 1>The basic argument was that so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines would leave artisans,</v>

77
00:04:22.091 --> 00:04:24.180
<v Speaker 1>workers and peasants out of what.</v>

78
00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.403
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

79
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.243
<v Speaker 1>Famous of these reactions was that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Luddites who you were at the </v>

80
00:04:29.621 --> 00:04:30.454
<v Speaker 1>beginning of the 19th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted attacks against factories and </v>

81
00:04:33.011 --> 00:04:36.640
<v Speaker 1>especially against machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hated them with all their might and</v>

82
00:04:36.641 --> 00:04:40.390
<v Speaker 1>of course had to destroy them because a </v>
<v Speaker 1>world with machines would be terrible.</v>

83
00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.090
<v Speaker 1>Between you and me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say that,</v>

84
00:04:43.091 --> 00:04:45.010
<v Speaker 1>thank goodness they didn't get their </v>
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>

85
00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:45.873
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you really imagine what life would </v>

86
00:04:46.841 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>be like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we continue,</v>

87
00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.850
<v Speaker 1>here's a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about trains?</v>

88
00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:52.743
<v Speaker 1>Do you like them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they useful or maybe you </v>

89
00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:55.960
<v Speaker 1>consider them dangerous?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The channels is,</v>

90
00:04:55.961 --> 00:04:58.870
<v Speaker 1>are you probably think that they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>worth having around.</v>

91
00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:01.180
<v Speaker 1>While the eighth president of the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

92
00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:02.014
<v Speaker 1>President Martin van Buren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he wouldn't agree with you as Michael </v>

93
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.570
<v Speaker 1>Cox and Richard Alm tell us in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>book,</v>

94
00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.360
<v Speaker 1>myths of the rich and poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why we're better off than we think.</v>

95
00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:14.560
<v Speaker 1>In 1829 Martin van Buren,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was very concerned about the dangers</v>

96
00:05:14.561 --> 00:05:15.394
<v Speaker 1>of the railroad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was so concerned that he even wrote </v>

97
00:05:17.831 --> 00:05:19.420
<v Speaker 1>to the president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Andrew Jackson,</v>

98
00:05:19.421 --> 00:05:22.510
<v Speaker 1>to asking to push a railroad ban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

99
00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.403
<v Speaker 1>You heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

100
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:26.363
<v Speaker 1>Martin van Buren thought that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>railroad would risk the jobs of </v>

101
00:05:28.771 --> 00:05:29.604
<v Speaker 1>thousands of people who worked in </v>
<v Speaker 1>deliveries and in canals and boat </v>

102
00:05:32.641 --> 00:05:33.870
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

103
00:05:33.871 --> 00:05:34.704
<v Speaker 1>since Van Buren also thought that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>ships were essential to defend the </v>

104
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:37.854
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you considered the railroad to be a </v>

105
00:05:39.421 --> 00:05:41.190
<v Speaker 1>serious threat to national scale.</v>

106
00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Not all in that same letter addressed to</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Andrew Jackson.</v>

107
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.193
<v Speaker 1>Van Buren also warns about the danger of</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transportation system that moved a </v>

108
00:05:51.411 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 1>whopping 24 kilometers per hour.</v>

109
00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:58.503
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

110
00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:04.431
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These arguments,</v>

111
00:06:04.431 --> 00:06:07.670
<v Speaker 1>they do seem a bit ridiculous nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but at the time,</v>

112
00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 1>many people took these ideas very </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously and it's okay.</v>

113
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.343
<v Speaker 1>It's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technological changes have caused </v>

114
00:06:13.821 --> 00:06:16.310
<v Speaker 1>difficulties throughout history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think for example,</v>

115
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.070
<v Speaker 1>about what happens with the development </v>
<v Speaker 1>of telecommunications.</v>

116
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 1>See Wenzel often.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He became massive in its early days.</v>

117
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.424
<v Speaker 1>When you wanted to talk to someone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you gave an operator the name and </v>

118
00:06:24.471 --> 00:06:26.520
<v Speaker 1>surname of the person you wanted to talk</v>
<v Speaker 1>to.</v>

119
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.543
<v Speaker 4>Rehab.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Would you call it the charges on this </v>

120
00:06:28.811 --> 00:06:29.644
<v Speaker 4>for me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>please?</v>

121
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:30.730
<v Speaker 4>One moment please.</v>

122
00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.910
<v Speaker 1>The second half of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which really wasn't so long ago,</v>

123
00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>tens of thousands of operators worked </v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting long distance calls.</v>

124
00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:44.580
<v Speaker 1>There's of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made the calls very,</v>

125
00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:45.240
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

126
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.073
<v Speaker 4>stock tag,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the world's smallest slightest cellular </v>

127
00:06:47.981 --> 00:06:49.730
<v Speaker 4>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I can see the battery,</v>

128
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.590
<v Speaker 4>one of the phone or anywhere like this,</v>
<v Speaker 4>man,</v>

129
00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:54.760
<v Speaker 4>how are you?</v>

130
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:55.833
<v Speaker 1>By 1980 technology allowed </v>
<v Speaker 1>communications to be made directly </v>

131
00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.690
<v Speaker 1>without any intermediaries other than </v>
<v Speaker 1>need.</v>

132
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.750
<v Speaker 1>The operators became irrelevant in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>calls became very,</v>

133
00:07:03.751 --> 00:07:04.584
<v Speaker 1>very cheap.</v>

134
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.820
<v Speaker 1>So the question is what happened to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the operators?</v>

135
00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to find new jobs and yes,</v>

136
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 1>I know adapting isn't always easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but evidently this change until often it</v>

137
00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.940
<v Speaker 1>was very beneficial for society as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole.</v>

138
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.850
<v Speaker 1>Communications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became easier and much cheaper.</v>

139
00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:21.743
<v Speaker 1>That's why the important thing is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate lots of employment </v>

140
00:07:24.181 --> 00:07:28.410
<v Speaker 1>opportunities within a society and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>make it relatively easy to change jobs.</v>

141
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Can you just imagine if a state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a government had forbidden these </v>

142
00:07:31.321 --> 00:07:32.154
<v Speaker 1>positions from disappearing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that country's communications would </v>

143
00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.153
<v Speaker 1>still be very slow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People would sometimes have to wait </v>

144
00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:40.680
<v Speaker 1>hours to speak with someone and cools </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be very expensive.</v>

145
00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:41.573
<v Speaker 1>All of this would have made the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the total number of jobs in that </v>

146
00:07:44.131 --> 00:07:46.410
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not very good because folks,</v>

147
00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:49.500
<v Speaker 1>we tend to forget one thing now as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>watch this video,</v>

148
00:07:49.501 --> 00:07:52.840
<v Speaker 1>your going through the time in history </v>
<v Speaker 1>where technology is used them.</v>

149
00:07:52.841 --> 00:07:53.410
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

150
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:54.243
<v Speaker 4>See,</v>

151
00:07:56.870 --> 00:07:57.703
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also the time where people worked </v>

152
00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.410
<v Speaker 1>the most.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

153
00:08:00.411 --> 00:08:01.244
<v Speaker 1>it's curious,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the countries that use the most </v>

154
00:08:02.721 --> 00:08:06.350
<v Speaker 1>robots are precisely those that suffer </v>
<v Speaker 1>the least unemployment,</v>

155
00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 1>which is definitely not a bad thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

156
00:08:08.571 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>some of you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>come on Simon,</v>

157
00:08:10.431 --> 00:08:12.680
<v Speaker 1>artificial intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be different.</v>

158
00:08:12.710 --> 00:08:14.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's dive into that.</v>

159
00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.430
<v Speaker 5>Are you listening?</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm of a,</v>

160
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:23.814
<v Speaker 5>I,</v>

161
00:08:25.310 --> 00:08:25.810
<v Speaker 4>Debbie.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Have you,</v>

162
00:08:25.810 --> 00:08:26.643
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time of artificial intelligence and </v>

163
00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:30.400
<v Speaker 1>robots,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's already here.</v>

164
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:31.263
<v Speaker 1>Everyday we use more products and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>services that function with artificial </v>

165
00:08:34.061 --> 00:08:34.894
<v Speaker 1>intelligence from voice assistants do </v>
<v Speaker 1>the autonomous cars that are already </v>

166
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:39.130
<v Speaker 1>beginning to circulate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

167
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the speed with which this intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>progresses is certainly impressive.</v>

168
00:08:43.330 --> 00:08:44.163
<v Speaker 1>We could say that artificial </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence involves applying the </v>

169
00:08:46.151 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>enormous power of computers to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

170
00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:51.430
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the last 30 years,</v>

171
00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>the cost of computing capacity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it became 200 times cheaper.</v>

172
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:56.843
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea of what this means,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that if the car industry's </v>

173
00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:00.233
<v Speaker 1>cost to devolved in the same way today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high ends car would cost only for 10 </v>

174
00:09:03.361 --> 00:09:05.430
<v Speaker 1>thousandths of what it does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

175
00:09:05.460 --> 00:09:09.540
<v Speaker 1>this would make it cheaper than a single</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan boulevard.</v>

176
00:09:09.630 --> 00:09:12.240
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've all of our under Nicolas Maduro,</v>

177
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:13.373
<v Speaker 1>we won't eat those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This evolution is precisely what </v>

178
00:09:18.631 --> 00:09:23.550
<v Speaker 1>explains why today a playstation four </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs less than $400 even if it is about</v>

179
00:09:23.551 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 1>2000 times more powerful than the Cray </v>
<v Speaker 1>to supercomputer.</v>

180
00:09:27.690 --> 00:09:29.550
<v Speaker 1>One of the most famous computers in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

181
00:09:29.551 --> 00:09:32.850
<v Speaker 1>which beat all records back in 1984 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this computer,</v>

182
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:37.880
<v Speaker 1>unlike the playstation four weighed two </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a half tons and cost $18 million.</v>

183
00:09:40.380 --> 00:09:45.150
<v Speaker 1>Today a playstation four can perform 1.8</v>
<v Speaker 1>4 trillion floating point operations per</v>

184
00:09:45.151 --> 00:09:45.984
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would take a person approximately </v>

185
00:09:47.370 --> 00:09:48.203
<v Speaker 1>60,000 years to do and it's precisely </v>
<v Speaker 1>this enormous calculation capacity that </v>

186
00:09:52.441 --> 00:09:56.100
<v Speaker 1>allows ais to replace us in several </v>
<v Speaker 1>tasks.</v>

187
00:09:58.090 --> 00:09:58.923
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later the autonomous car will </v>

188
00:10:00.761 --> 00:10:01.594
<v Speaker 1>end up imposing itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We simply wouldn't be able to compete </v>

189
00:10:03.881 --> 00:10:04.714
<v Speaker 1>with its calculation abilities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially now that these machines have </v>

190
00:10:06.911 --> 00:10:09.640
<v Speaker 1>managed to perceive their environment </v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to cameras,</v>

191
00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:12.010
<v Speaker 1>microphones and sensors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So yes,</v>

192
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:12.873
<v Speaker 1>based on how things are evolving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems almost certain that in a </v>

193
00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:16.324
<v Speaker 1>relatively short time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many mechanical and routine jobs from </v>

194
00:10:18.911 --> 00:10:22.060
<v Speaker 1>factories to the field will be carried </v>
<v Speaker 1>out by smart machines.</v>

195
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:28.390
<v Speaker 1>It means the productivity will increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lawsons with us.</v>

196
00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>That also means most people's well being</v>
<v Speaker 1>will also increase.</v>

197
00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:33.423
<v Speaker 1>I think the next 30 years people will </v>
<v Speaker 1>only work four hours a day and maybe </v>

198
00:10:36.611 --> 00:10:39.820
<v Speaker 1>four days a week.</v>
<v Speaker 1>My grandfather worked 16 hours a day and</v>

199
00:10:39.821 --> 00:10:41.860
<v Speaker 1>the farmland and he thought he was very </v>
<v Speaker 1>busy.</v>

200
00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.280
<v Speaker 1>We work eight hours five days a week and</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think we are very busy.</v>

201
00:10:45.340 --> 00:10:48.520
<v Speaker 1>Jack Ma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chairman of Alibaba and no Dallas.</v>

202
00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:49.383
<v Speaker 1>During this time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many new jobs will be created of all </v>

203
00:10:51.311 --> 00:10:52.144
<v Speaker 1>kinds because you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question we may want to ask </v>

204
00:10:54.281 --> 00:10:57.820
<v Speaker 1>ourselves is how close are the machines </v>
<v Speaker 1>to surpassing us?</v>

205
00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.700
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some tasks that really close,</v>

206
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:01.150
<v Speaker 1>but for many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not really.</v>

207
00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines can compete very quickly,</v>

208
00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:07.060
<v Speaker 1>but they have problems learning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Computers are very inefficient learners.</v>

209
00:11:07.061 --> 00:11:09.910
<v Speaker 1>They only recognize patterns after </v>
<v Speaker 1>analyzing something.</v>

210
00:11:09.911 --> 00:11:14.620
<v Speaker 1>An overwhelming number of times since </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is humanity's great advantage,</v>

211
00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:20.140
<v Speaker 1>the most advanced machine learning </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems require thousands of examples to</v>

212
00:11:20.141 --> 00:11:20.974
<v Speaker 1>acquire new concepts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While humans can generalize from a few </v>

213
00:11:23.501 --> 00:11:24.334
<v Speaker 1>examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many animals can learn from a limited </v>

214
00:11:26.261 --> 00:11:27.094
<v Speaker 1>number of experiences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but humans seem particularly good at </v>

215
00:11:29.741 --> 00:11:33.100
<v Speaker 1>generalizing based on just a few </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiences.</v>

216
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:33.993
<v Speaker 1>Greg Corrado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Stanford neuroscientist and director of </v>

217
00:11:36.491 --> 00:11:37.324
<v Speaker 1>augmented intelligence at Google.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why nowadays humans are </v>

218
00:11:40.781 --> 00:11:43.510
<v Speaker 1>far superior in areas such as </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity,</v>

219
00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.130
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>intuition,</v>

220
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.480
<v Speaker 1>and empathy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>

221
00:11:46.510 --> 00:11:48.700
<v Speaker 1>nobody can predict the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but until now,</v>

222
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:52.480
<v Speaker 1>machines have always meant more jobs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>better welfare for all</v>

223
00:11:58.910 --> 00:12:01.670
<v Speaker 1>in the near future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's almost certain that what is already</v>

224
00:12:01.671 --> 00:12:02.504
<v Speaker 1>happening will continue to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some jobs will be destroyed and many </v>

225
00:12:05.901 --> 00:12:08.900
<v Speaker 1>others will be created and also need </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly qualified ones,</v>

226
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:09.763
<v Speaker 1>but jobs of all kinds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's probably working hours will </v>

227
00:12:12.081 --> 00:12:14.720
<v Speaker 1>decrease and to real wages will </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>

228
00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:15.554
<v Speaker 1>Beyond that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very hard to predict what may or </v>

229
00:12:16.851 --> 00:12:17.684
<v Speaker 1>may not happen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's not fall into the same </v>

230
00:12:19.221 --> 00:12:20.054
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that former US president Martin</v>
<v Speaker 1>van Buren fell in Duke during his fear </v>

231
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:24.703
<v Speaker 1>and rejection of the railroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are still many challenges to </v>

232
00:12:27.390 --> 00:12:31.250
<v Speaker 1>overcome in the world such as poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>and environmental sustainability and the</v>

233
00:12:31.251 --> 00:12:33.200
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can really help us a lot.</v>

234
00:12:33.230 --> 00:12:35.870
<v Speaker 1>But now as the alternate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's your perspective on ai?</v>

235
00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.500
<v Speaker 1>Do you leave your comments below as well</v>
