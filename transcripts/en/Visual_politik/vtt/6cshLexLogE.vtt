1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>This is a special video today we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about a topic that heavily </v>

2
00:00:03.751 --> 00:00:08.520
<v Speaker 1>affects both this channel and in general</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of Youtube as a platform,</v>

3
00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:11.610
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody is shutting down this channel,</v>

4
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:12.444
<v Speaker 1>but maybe those of us who watched from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union will no longer be </v>

5
00:00:15.121 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 1>able to watch some videos yesterday were</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about article 13,</v>

6
00:00:19.321 --> 00:00:22.650
<v Speaker 1>something you might have heard of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if you live in Europe because</v>

7
00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:26.220
<v Speaker 1>youtube seems to have replaced all of my</v>
<v Speaker 1>youtube ads which were previously.</v>

8
00:00:26.221 --> 00:00:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Would you love a chocolate bar with </v>
<v Speaker 1>something related to article 13?</v>

9
00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.700
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's quickly make one thing clear here.</v>

10
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.563
<v Speaker 1>We definitely biased,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's probably not a huge surprise </v>

11
00:00:42.231 --> 00:00:43.250
<v Speaker 1>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

12
00:00:43.251 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>we're playing an active role in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>matter.</v>

13
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.273
<v Speaker 1>One member of the visual holistic team </v>
<v Speaker 1>was in Brussels recently talking about </v>

14
00:00:49.371 --> 00:00:53.030
<v Speaker 1>article 13 with policymakers who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently negotiating it.</v>

15
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.893
<v Speaker 1>That by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be Fonseca also known as the </v>

16
00:00:56.181 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 1>drunk Spanish guy doing the voiceovers </v>
<v Speaker 1>in some of the earlier episodes.</v>

17
00:00:59.301 --> 00:01:00.830
<v Speaker 1>According to some comments.</v>

18
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:01.940
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

19
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.313
<v Speaker 1>To this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is an association representing </v>

20
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:07.743
<v Speaker 1>European online creators.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why a group of European Youtube </v>

21
00:01:10.961 --> 00:01:14.200
<v Speaker 1>channels decided to take a bit of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiative and show our concerns,</v>

22
00:01:14.201 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 1>do the relevant politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>

23
00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.030
<v Speaker 1>We were one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so for those who don't know,</v>

24
00:01:19.031 --> 00:01:19.864
<v Speaker 1>it's article 13 is part of an EU </v>
<v Speaker 1>directive which aims to regulate </v>

25
00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 1>copyright online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question is now,</v>

26
00:01:26.801 --> 00:01:28.950
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is article 13?</v>

27
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.920
<v Speaker 1>Is it as terrible as everyone is saying </v>
<v Speaker 1>and most important of all,</v>

28
00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.980
<v Speaker 1>what can we content creators do about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>

29
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer all of these</v>

30
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:39.490
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

31
00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:40.713
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history </v>

32
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.013
<v Speaker 1>for me for the last few years answering </v>
<v Speaker 1>the what do you do for a living </v>

33
00:01:52.761 --> 00:01:55.100
<v Speaker 1>question?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I kind of got sort of complicated.</v>

34
00:01:55.101 --> 00:01:57.030
<v Speaker 1>Some people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially maybe the oldest,</v>

35
00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:57.981
<v Speaker 1>they tend to think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

36
00:01:57.981 --> 00:01:58.814
<v Speaker 1>well that's nice dear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what you do for actual </v>

37
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:04.080
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of them I've just given up on.</v>

38
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.933
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure that my grandma thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm a television presenter here in </v>

39
00:02:08.121 --> 00:02:08.660
<v Speaker 1>Prague.</v>

40
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.493
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.203
<v Speaker 1>But the answer is yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I make a living doing this and it's </v>

42
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:21.120
<v Speaker 1>probably not all that surprising to all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of you millennials watching.</v>

43
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.090
<v Speaker 1>Now we British,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't like talking about money.</v>

44
00:02:24.091 --> 00:02:24.924
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fun factor were seven times more likely </v>

45
00:02:27.031 --> 00:02:27.864
<v Speaker 1>to tell someone we've had an std that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>all to reveal our income to the </v>

46
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.020
<v Speaker 1>awkwardness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's just take visual politic.</v>

47
00:02:34.021 --> 00:02:36.840
<v Speaker 1>Both the English and the Spanish version</v>
<v Speaker 1>combines.</v>

48
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:40.320
<v Speaker 1>They get about 10 million views a month </v>
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>

49
00:02:40.321 --> 00:02:42.750
<v Speaker 1>this translates in do something.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

50
00:02:42.751 --> 00:02:45.090
<v Speaker 1>it's a lot of people watching now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No visual politic.</v>

51
00:02:45.091 --> 00:02:48.810
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't make us millionaires,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but along with the Patriot on donations,</v>

52
00:02:48.811 --> 00:02:50.550
<v Speaker 1>thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the ads,</v>

53
00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.010
<v Speaker 1>we can all draw a decent salary and </v>
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>

54
00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:53.844
<v Speaker 1>we're not the only ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There aren't thousands of creators just </v>

55
00:02:56.821 --> 00:02:59.040
<v Speaker 1>like us all across Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>creators,</v>

56
00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.530
<v Speaker 1>enough of an audience to make an income </v>
<v Speaker 1>and even create new jobs.</v>

57
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.633
<v Speaker 1>And that's only youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It also happens on other platforms like </v>

58
00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:13.500
<v Speaker 1>instagram and facebook and twitch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that online creators,</v>

59
00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:16.890
<v Speaker 1>we've become an industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's not exactly an oil and gas,</v>

60
00:03:16.891 --> 00:03:17.724
<v Speaker 1>but it does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an industry that employs thousands </v>

61
00:03:20.581 --> 00:03:24.540
<v Speaker 1>of people in Europe and creates value </v>
<v Speaker 1>for society most of the time.</v>

62
00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube might be an American company,</v>

63
00:03:27.181 --> 00:03:30.300
<v Speaker 1>but the world's biggest youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's Pewdie Pie I think.</v>

64
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:31.443
<v Speaker 2>Hold on.</v>

65
00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.590
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>go Pewdie Pie.</v>

66
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:38.860
<v Speaker 1>He is still beating t series and he's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Swedish.</v>

67
00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:41.560
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what exactly is the problem then?</v>

68
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

69
00:03:42.521 --> 00:03:45.460
<v Speaker 1>there is no association that represents </v>
<v Speaker 1>US creators,</v>

70
00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.823
<v Speaker 1>media corporations in record labels and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've got trade associations and </v>

71
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>they've even got big lobbies in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussels.</v>

72
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.570
<v Speaker 1>We don't why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:03:58.571 --> 00:04:00.790
<v Speaker 1>mainly because we started out little by </v>
<v Speaker 1>little.</v>

74
00:04:00.791 --> 00:04:03.610
<v Speaker 1>The story behind every youtuber is </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same.</v>

75
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.770
<v Speaker 1>You start small,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a few videos,</v>

76
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:08.890
<v Speaker 1>hopefully you see a bit of growth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then suddenly you can be like,</v>

77
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:10.660
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I do this as a job.</v>

78
00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>And as you can imagine during this </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

79
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:14.830
<v Speaker 1>as someone who's been through this </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

80
00:04:14.831 --> 00:04:17.110
<v Speaker 1>I haven't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I imagine most people don't think at</v>

81
00:04:17.111 --> 00:04:20.260
<v Speaker 1>any point now I should create a trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>association,</v>

82
00:04:20.261 --> 00:04:21.094
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case one day the European Union </v>

83
00:04:22.781 --> 00:04:25.600
<v Speaker 1>is like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's introduce a big old directive that</v>

84
00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:26.463
<v Speaker 1>really affects these people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just something that doesn't come </v>

85
00:04:29.201 --> 00:04:30.034
<v Speaker 1>across on mine.</v>

86
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.440
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so at this point it's probably important</v>

87
00:04:37.441 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>for you to know exactly how copyright </v>
<v Speaker 1>works in Europe.</v>

88
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.483
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this day we're under these so called </v>

89
00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.660
<v Speaker 1>ecommerce directive and also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright directive.</v>

90
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:49.140
<v Speaker 1>Both of these were passed back in 2001 </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

91
00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does this legislation work?</v>

92
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.163
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's imagine that I upload a video to </v>

93
00:04:54.661 --> 00:04:57.920
<v Speaker 1>visual politic and I use a video clip </v>
<v Speaker 1>from a band.</v>

94
00:04:57.921 --> 00:04:58.754
<v Speaker 1>So let's say I upload a song by the band</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasmania who often provide music for </v>

95
00:05:02.281 --> 00:05:03.114
<v Speaker 1>this channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume I upload their song </v>

96
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.083
<v Speaker 1>without permission.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means I'm actually created </v>

97
00:05:07.681 --> 00:05:08.514
<v Speaker 1>something illegal Tasmania role.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The record label who holds their rights </v>

98
00:05:11.671 --> 00:05:12.750
<v Speaker 1>can then sue me.</v>

99
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.190
<v Speaker 1>This means that essentially they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>request a big fine from me.</v>

100
00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:22.620
<v Speaker 1>And do they do it well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably not.</v>

101
00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 1>I'm a pretty small creator in my </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets.</v>

102
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.380
<v Speaker 1>I'll just not that deep so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can Tasmania do?</v>

103
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.273
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can go to youtube and they can ask </v>

104
00:05:30.421 --> 00:05:32.330
<v Speaker 1>them to take down the video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

105
00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.173
<v Speaker 1>this process is often mostly automatic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube actually has a tool that small </v>

106
00:05:36.901 --> 00:05:39.510
<v Speaker 1>filter called content id.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

107
00:05:39.511 --> 00:05:42.870
<v Speaker 1>Tasmania would send all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>information about their on to youtube.</v>

108
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.960
<v Speaker 1>This way youtube can scan the platform </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for that song.</v>

109
00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Anytime they find it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can take down the offending video.</v>

110
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 1>This is how the law works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

111
00:05:56.151 --> 00:05:57.410
<v Speaker 1>that's all fine and that's all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>good,</v>

112
00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>but just</v>

113
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.400
<v Speaker 2>hold on a second because this is where </v>
<v Speaker 2>the interesting part comes in.</v>

114
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 2>Now it says mania can pretty much ask </v>
<v Speaker 2>youtube,</v>

115
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.773
<v Speaker 2>hey youtube,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about instead of just taking that </v>

116
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:08.240
<v Speaker 2>video down,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your slice me off a bit,</v>

117
00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.480
<v Speaker 2>a sweet sweet revenue pie and send it my</v>
<v Speaker 2>way.</v>

118
00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.343
<v Speaker 2>Now according to the letter of the law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Youtube doesn't have to block the song </v>

119
00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:15.643
<v Speaker 2>if requested,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the law doesn't say anything about </v>

120
00:06:17.571 --> 00:06:18.404
<v Speaker 2>paying licenses,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is essentially what Tasmania </v>

121
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.410
<v Speaker 2>wants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

122
00:06:21.411 --> 00:06:23.120
<v Speaker 2>since youtube is apparently pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>chill,</v>

123
00:06:23.121 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 2>they want to do business with Tasmania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they essentially say,</v>

124
00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:27.253
<v Speaker 2>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then what we'll do is we'll negotiate a </v>

125
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.174
<v Speaker 2>license,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll give you a little slice and </v>

126
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:33.080
<v Speaker 2>everyone's happy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sounds good,</v>

127
00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:37.220
<v Speaker 2>and otherwise they've negotiated a </v>
<v Speaker 2>contract and now you might be wondering,</v>

128
00:06:37.221 --> 00:06:38.054
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how big is that slice of the revenue </v>

129
00:06:39.921 --> 00:06:40.754
<v Speaker 2>pie?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

130
00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:43.610
<v Speaker 2>according to the record labels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty low.</v>

131
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:45.440
<v Speaker 2>Just consider what economy.</v>

132
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.763
<v Speaker 1>Some user upload content platforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>refused to compensate artists and all </v>

133
00:06:54.491 --> 00:06:55.324
<v Speaker 1>music creators fairly for their work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they exploited it for their own </v>

134
00:06:58.721 --> 00:07:01.420
<v Speaker 1>profit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sir Paul Mccartney,</v>

135
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.060
<v Speaker 1>the question now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Paul Mccartney,</v>

136
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:07.630
<v Speaker 1>right or wrong?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube states they give to the majority</v>

137
00:07:07.631 --> 00:07:08.464
<v Speaker 1>of the revenue to the record label,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we don't really know because the </v>

138
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.380
<v Speaker 1>labels want to keep this information </v>
<v Speaker 1>confidential.</v>

139
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.020
<v Speaker 1>We also don't know because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well we asked them and nobody would tell</v>

140
00:07:17.021 --> 00:07:19.270
<v Speaker 1>us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is one thing we do know though,</v>

141
00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.180
<v Speaker 1>the European music associations like </v>
<v Speaker 1>IFP,</v>

142
00:07:22.181 --> 00:07:25.420
<v Speaker 1>why or impala,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want youtube to pay more.</v>

143
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.283
<v Speaker 1>They claim there is a so called value </v>
<v Speaker 1>gap between the Revenue Youtube </v>

144
00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:32.710
<v Speaker 1>generates and what they pay them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

145
00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:37.180
<v Speaker 1>they want to have a stronger negotiation</v>
<v Speaker 1>position and how can they do that?</v>

146
00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.283
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that would be with a new copyright law </v>

147
00:07:40.001 --> 00:07:43.360
<v Speaker 1>that forces platforms like youtube to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay a license.</v>

148
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.253
<v Speaker 1>This is why in the year 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Commission wrote the first </v>

149
00:07:47.651 --> 00:07:48.970
<v Speaker 1>draft for this</v>

150
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.080
<v Speaker 2>direct</v>

151
00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:54.110
<v Speaker 1>Dev on copyright in the digital single </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

152
00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:57.873
<v Speaker 1>According to this law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube and the rest of the user </v>

153
00:07:59.741 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>generated content platforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ms dot compensate fairly to create us.</v>

154
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:04.263
<v Speaker 1>This means that youtube doesn't give </v>
<v Speaker 1>that added percentage because they're </v>

155
00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:06.973
<v Speaker 1>chill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather because they're legally </v>

156
00:08:07.901 --> 00:08:10.630
<v Speaker 1>compelled to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is a big deal.</v>

157
00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:15.040
<v Speaker 1>This means that the record labels have a</v>
<v Speaker 1>better negotiating position.</v>

158
00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so so far all of this,</v>

159
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:17.793
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't actually sound that terrible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So just hold on a moment though because </v>

160
00:08:21.491 --> 00:08:23.800
<v Speaker 1>this is where things get really </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated.</v>

161
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.850
<v Speaker 1>Devil is in the details as you might or </v>
<v Speaker 1>might not know,</v>

162
00:08:33.851 --> 00:08:36.070
<v Speaker 1>the European Commission itself cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>pass the law.</v>

163
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:39.390
<v Speaker 1>They have to send it first to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>European Parliament and vendor,</v>

164
00:08:39.470 --> 00:08:41.740
<v Speaker 1>the European Council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These two institutions,</v>

165
00:08:41.741 --> 00:08:44.650
<v Speaker 1>they have to write their own versions of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Lauren.</v>

166
00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:48.790
<v Speaker 1>This is where the real issue with </v>
<v Speaker 1>article 13 comes up.</v>

167
00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:53.333
<v Speaker 1>Online content sharing service providers</v>
<v Speaker 1>perform an act of communication to the </v>

168
00:08:57.241 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 1>public.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Article Thirteen,</v>

169
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.680
<v Speaker 1>paragraph one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>EU parliament vision.</v>

170
00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:03.120
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be thinking,</v>

171
00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:04.050
<v Speaker 1>all right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

172
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:06.120
<v Speaker 1>what is up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where exactly is the problem?</v>

173
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.093
<v Speaker 1>What does it mean for you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I really do need to translate what we </v>

174
00:09:08.971 --> 00:09:11.790
<v Speaker 1>just heard from the language of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>European Parliament.</v>

175
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:12.773
<v Speaker 1>It basically means Youtube would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>unlimited liability on the content that </v>

176
00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:19.670
<v Speaker 1>stays on that platform to illustrate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>impact of this.</v>

177
00:09:19.671 --> 00:09:23.190
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to Tasmania band example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they couldn't do see me.</v>

178
00:09:23.191 --> 00:09:24.024
<v Speaker 1>They could also sue me and youtube and </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that I mentioned the deep </v>

179
00:09:27.331 --> 00:09:28.164
<v Speaker 1>pockets swell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube appsolutely has those other </v>

180
00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.390
<v Speaker 1>words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to this legislation,</v>

181
00:09:33.391 --> 00:09:35.750
<v Speaker 1>youtube would have to spend millions in </v>
<v Speaker 1>losses.</v>

182
00:09:40.340 --> 00:09:41.173
<v Speaker 1>Just think about it because there's such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge quantity of video going up to </v>

183
00:09:43.671 --> 00:09:48.671
<v Speaker 1>youtube and need over 300 hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>videos are uploaded every minute.</v>

184
00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:50.233
<v Speaker 1>The chances are many of those videos can</v>
<v Speaker 1>have some sort of copyright violation </v>

185
00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:54.793
<v Speaker 1>and youtube just needs to have one video</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a copyright issue to give them a </v>

186
00:09:57.891 --> 00:10:01.190
<v Speaker 1>potentially multi million dollar legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>headache.</v>

187
00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:04.280
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously youtube cannot deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>that kind of legal exposure,</v>

188
00:10:04.281 --> 00:10:07.670
<v Speaker 1>so they have to find a way to avoid it </v>
<v Speaker 1>and how do they do that?</v>

189
00:10:07.730 --> 00:10:10.040
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to build a wall,</v>

190
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.530
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very strict firewall.</v>

191
00:10:12.590 --> 00:10:16.640
<v Speaker 1>Basically any video with third party </v>
<v Speaker 1>content would have to be blocked.</v>

192
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.990
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're in America,</v>

193
00:10:17.991 --> 00:10:18.824
<v Speaker 1>you could still watch it because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>law only affects content watched or </v>

194
00:10:21.561 --> 00:10:24.650
<v Speaker 1>uploaded inside Europe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if this gets passed,</v>

195
00:10:24.651 --> 00:10:25.484
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>good luck trying to watch videos inside </v>

196
00:10:26.871 --> 00:10:27.560
<v Speaker 1>of European.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

197
00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:28.393
<v Speaker 2>union</v>

198
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:34.720
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not just talking about people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who are purposefully violating copyright</v>

199
00:10:34.721 --> 00:10:35.554
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about most videos because </v>

200
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.340
<v Speaker 1>it's really hard to work out what is and</v>
<v Speaker 1>what.</v>

201
00:10:39.341 --> 00:10:41.830
<v Speaker 1>It's not third party content.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

202
00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:42.723
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically everything just beyond a dude </v>

203
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:46.504
<v Speaker 1>talking to a camera with a white </v>
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds would have a risk of being </v>

204
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:51.010
<v Speaker 1>blocked and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

205
00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.873
<v Speaker 1>that actually includes this video </v>
<v Speaker 1>because right now I'm going to show you </v>

206
00:10:54.011 --> 00:10:54.844
<v Speaker 1>a quote from Donald Trump on CNN.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should let me run the </v>

207
00:10:58.391 --> 00:11:01.420
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You run CNN and if you did it well,</v>

208
00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:02.283
<v Speaker 1>your ratings,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if I may ask the question was present </v>

209
00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:05.770
<v Speaker 1>from it and I know what you're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>say.</v>

210
00:11:05.771 --> 00:11:06.640
<v Speaker 1>You're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:08.920
<v Speaker 1>come on son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You haven't done anything illegal there.</v>

212
00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:11.360
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's got to be fair use,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

213
00:11:11.470 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're absolutely right.</v>

214
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:14.343
<v Speaker 1>According to the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can use content in this manner for </v>

215
00:11:16.391 --> 00:11:19.270
<v Speaker 1>Satta an illustration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what?</v>

216
00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:20.133
<v Speaker 1>That youtube firewall isn't a lawyer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's an algorithm and algorithms don't </v>

217
00:11:23.231 --> 00:11:26.700
<v Speaker 1>understand content store the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's brand new youtube far.</v>

218
00:11:26.701 --> 00:11:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll just say whoa.</v>

219
00:11:27.671 --> 00:11:28.504
<v Speaker 1>Third Party content,</v>
<v Speaker 1>block it and last Vance and the same </v>

220
00:11:30.671 --> 00:11:32.650
<v Speaker 1>goes for when I show you this clip from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasmania.</v>

221
00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:39.183
<v Speaker 2>Your</v>

222
00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.260
<v Speaker 1>is this a legal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

223
00:11:43.290 --> 00:11:48.060
<v Speaker 1>but good luck trying to make a robot </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands legal caveats and really all</v>

224
00:11:48.061 --> 00:11:48.894
<v Speaker 1>of my youtube creator comrades watching </v>
<v Speaker 1>this video are going to agree with me </v>

225
00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:55.270
<v Speaker 1>that there are many problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>filters on youtube already.</v>

226
00:11:55.271 --> 00:11:56.104
<v Speaker 1>So imagine how tough it is going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>when there's an even more aggressive </v>

227
00:11:58.181 --> 00:11:59.014
<v Speaker 1>firewall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a moment because it's not </v>

228
00:12:01.061 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>all bad news.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an alternative indeed,</v>

229
00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:04.533
<v Speaker 1>there is a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a solution that makes everybody </v>

230
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.570
<v Speaker 1>moderately happy and that is actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty realistic.</v>

231
00:12:13.980 --> 00:12:16.740
<v Speaker 1>Can it be done about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I told you before,</v>

232
00:12:16.741 --> 00:12:20.220
<v Speaker 1>this copyright directive has been voted </v>
<v Speaker 1>on in the European parliaments,</v>

233
00:12:20.221 --> 00:12:22.830
<v Speaker 1>but this doesn't mean the legislation </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been passed.</v>

234
00:12:23.010 --> 00:12:25.200
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're still in the middle of it all.</v>

235
00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.780
<v Speaker 1>You see the process to pass an EU </v>
<v Speaker 1>directive,</v>

236
00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:29.910
<v Speaker 1>it goes as follows.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First step,</v>

237
00:12:29.911 --> 00:12:32.490
<v Speaker 1>the European Commission creates a first </v>
<v Speaker 1>draft.</v>

238
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.520
<v Speaker 1>That's how we got the first version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>article 13.</v>

239
00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>Second step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This draft goes to the EU parliament.</v>

240
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.190
<v Speaker 1>They write another draft and they vote </v>
<v Speaker 1>on it.</v>

241
00:12:41.220 --> 00:12:44.250
<v Speaker 1>This is why we have another version of </v>
<v Speaker 1>article 13,</v>

242
00:12:44.310 --> 00:12:45.143
<v Speaker 1>but now there is a third step and a </v>
<v Speaker 1>third player coming in and that's the </v>

243
00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:49.810
<v Speaker 1>European Council.</v>

244
00:12:49.810 --> 00:12:50.643
<v Speaker 2>So</v>

245
00:12:54.100 --> 00:12:54.933
<v Speaker 1>the European Council is where all of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>member states are represented and Oh </v>

246
00:12:57.551 --> 00:12:58.384
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have approved another veteran of </v>

247
00:12:59.741 --> 00:13:01.570
<v Speaker 1>article 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

248
00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:04.290
<v Speaker 1>dear view is we don't just have what our</v>
<v Speaker 1>for 13,</v>

249
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:06.250
<v Speaker 1>we actually have three different </v>
<v Speaker 1>versions.</v>

250
00:13:06.251 --> 00:13:07.580
<v Speaker 1>One from the commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Waterford,</v>

251
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:08.433
<v Speaker 1>the parliament and one from the council.</v>
<v Speaker 1>European political institutions are so </v>

252
00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:15.250
<v Speaker 1>simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>said no one ever so.</v>

253
00:13:15.251 --> 00:13:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens next?</v>

254
00:13:16.361 --> 00:13:18.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we are in the third step,</v>

255
00:13:18.461 --> 00:13:20.740
<v Speaker 1>which is when the condition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the parliaments and the council,</v>

256
00:13:20.741 --> 00:13:24.130
<v Speaker 1>they get together and they negotiate in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brussels speak.</v>

257
00:13:24.310 --> 00:13:26.410
<v Speaker 1>This is cooled of the trial logs</v>

258
00:13:31.550 --> 00:13:33.260
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is sort of a dialogue,</v>

259
00:13:33.261 --> 00:13:35.060
<v Speaker 1>but with three people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like I said,</v>

260
00:13:35.061 --> 00:13:38.690
<v Speaker 1>things are never simple in Brussels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the words they use,</v>

261
00:13:39.140 --> 00:13:41.960
<v Speaker 1>so let's imagine a big room with a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>round table.</v>

262
00:13:41.961 --> 00:13:42.794
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand we have the commission </v>
<v Speaker 1>representative and our advisors on the </v>

263
00:13:45.381 --> 00:13:46.214
<v Speaker 1>other.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have the representative of the </v>

264
00:13:46.881 --> 00:13:47.714
<v Speaker 1>parliaments and on the other we have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>one from the council counseling all of </v>

265
00:13:50.721 --> 00:13:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the representatives and advisors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have over 30 people negotiating.</v>

266
00:13:54.440 --> 00:13:57.590
<v Speaker 1>They meet almost every week and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>better believe me,</v>

267
00:13:57.710 --> 00:14:02.000
<v Speaker 1>it is a long process which probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't surprise you.</v>

268
00:14:02.120 --> 00:14:04.400
<v Speaker 1>In this case we have three different </v>
<v Speaker 1>texts and believe me,</v>

269
00:14:04.401 --> 00:14:06.830
<v Speaker 1>the one from the council is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

270
00:14:12.620 --> 00:14:13.453
<v Speaker 3>The absence of the authorization and </v>
<v Speaker 3>online content sharing provider shall </v>

271
00:14:17.601 --> 00:14:18.434
<v Speaker 3>not be liable for the acts of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>communication to the public when it </v>

272
00:14:22.131 --> 00:14:22.964
<v Speaker 3>demonstrates that it has made its best </v>
<v Speaker 3>efforts and upon notification by rights </v>

273
00:14:27.951 --> 00:14:32.600
<v Speaker 3>holders,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it has acted expedia mostly to remove or</v>

274
00:14:32.601 --> 00:14:36.260
<v Speaker 3>disable access to these works.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Article 13,</v>

275
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:37.250
<v Speaker 3>paragraph four.</v>

276
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:39.420
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me translate that for you.</v>

277
00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.560
<v Speaker 1>This means that youtube is liable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the content on their platform,</v>

278
00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:46.950
<v Speaker 1>but the liability is missing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jesus still,</v>

279
00:14:46.951 --> 00:14:48.900
<v Speaker 1>we might need to clarify what that </v>
<v Speaker 1>means,</v>

280
00:14:48.901 --> 00:14:50.880
<v Speaker 1>so let's get back to the Tasmania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

281
00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:51.743
<v Speaker 1>with this new lauren hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Youtube must report to them the songs </v>

282
00:14:54.021 --> 00:14:54.854
<v Speaker 1>that are uploaded on the platform and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to ask them whether they want </v>

283
00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.780
<v Speaker 1>to take the video down or get a license </v>
<v Speaker 1>from it.</v>

284
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.020
<v Speaker 1>At this moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tasmania will have to add their data and</v>

285
00:15:03.050 --> 00:15:05.330
<v Speaker 1>metadata into a form.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way,</v>

286
00:15:05.331 --> 00:15:06.164
<v Speaker 1>that filter youtube already has these so</v>
<v Speaker 1>called content ID system already knows </v>

287
00:15:10.041 --> 00:15:11.900
<v Speaker 1>what to track,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

288
00:15:11.930 --> 00:15:12.763
<v Speaker 1>according to this article 13 version,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if youtube shows they have done </v>

289
00:15:15.291 --> 00:15:17.510
<v Speaker 1>everything possible to protect the </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright,</v>

290
00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:22.720
<v Speaker 1>they cannot be sued.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

291
00:15:25.271 --> 00:15:26.104
<v Speaker 1>if youtube plays by the rules,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they can avoid a lot of legal </v>

292
00:15:29.051 --> 00:15:30.310
<v Speaker 1>uncertainty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

293
00:15:30.340 --> 00:15:32.050
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have to pay more money to the</v>

294
00:15:32.051 --> 00:15:35.440
<v Speaker 1>record labels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's no existential risk anymore,</v>

295
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:36.393
<v Speaker 1>and of course we.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their content creators would also be </v>

296
00:15:38.051 --> 00:15:41.620
<v Speaker 1>happy to because we didn't have to worry</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all of our videos being blocked.</v>

297
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:42.670
<v Speaker 1>And finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

298
00:15:42.671 --> 00:15:45.670
<v Speaker 1>the record labels are happy as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they get what they need.</v>

299
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:47.770
<v Speaker 1>Better conditions for negotiating.</v>

300
00:15:52.370 --> 00:15:53.203
<v Speaker 1>So let me quickly summarize for you </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the difference between the </v>

301
00:15:55.141 --> 00:15:55.974
<v Speaker 1>parliament and the council positions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of the parliaments of </v>

302
00:15:58.711 --> 00:16:02.340
<v Speaker 1>Ashton is that European youtube would </v>
<v Speaker 1>just become another TV channel.</v>

303
00:16:02.341 --> 00:16:05.100
<v Speaker 1>One of the creators you already have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>big audience would survive.</v>

304
00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:05.993
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because they're the only ones you can </v>

305
00:16:06.721 --> 00:16:09.990
<v Speaker 1>pay a lawyer to manage all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>copyright issue so that Youtube will let</v>

306
00:16:09.991 --> 00:16:10.824
<v Speaker 1>them upload videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's going to be a pretty big </v>

307
00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:14.003
<v Speaker 1>pool and it's going to be pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to surpass for the hundreds </v>

308
00:16:17.490 --> 00:16:18.323
<v Speaker 1>of thousands of small creators,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there is a way to find a common </v>

309
00:16:21.901 --> 00:16:22.734
<v Speaker 1>ground for all of the players here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course it's compromise and </v>

310
00:16:25.891 --> 00:16:28.320
<v Speaker 1>compromise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's what politics is all about.</v>

311
00:16:28.620 --> 00:16:30.180
<v Speaker 1>So now the big question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

312
00:16:30.181 --> 00:16:33.480
<v Speaker 1>what comes after this step?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the fourth step here?</v>

313
00:16:33.630 --> 00:16:34.463
<v Speaker 1>While officer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this legislation has been negotiated by </v>

314
00:16:35.911 --> 00:16:36.744
<v Speaker 1>the trial logs.</v>

315
00:16:36.810 --> 00:16:40.950
<v Speaker 1>They bring it back to the parliaments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that they vote yes or no on the text and</v>

316
00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:44.970
<v Speaker 1>then we go to the final step.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is an EU directive.</v>

317
00:16:45.030 --> 00:16:47.610
<v Speaker 1>Now an EU directive is not actually a </v>
<v Speaker 1>law,</v>

318
00:16:47.611 --> 00:16:50.640
<v Speaker 1>but it's rather a guideline.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So after the director of gets passed,</v>

319
00:16:50.641 --> 00:16:54.720
<v Speaker 1>it has to go to all of the member states</v>
<v Speaker 1>where they turn it international laws,</v>

320
00:16:54.810 --> 00:16:55.643
<v Speaker 1>and this is another moment where online </v>
<v Speaker 1>creators have to show up and speak to </v>

321
00:16:58.111 --> 00:16:59.960
<v Speaker 1>their national governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

322
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.640
<v Speaker 1>if you're a European youtube creator </v>
<v Speaker 1>watching this right now,</v>

323
00:17:03.030 --> 00:17:03.863
<v Speaker 1>that includes you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if there's one thing that we learned </v>

324
00:17:05.941 --> 00:17:08.340
<v Speaker 1>from our trip to Brussels is kind of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>policymakers,</v>

325
00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:09.233
<v Speaker 1>they don't even know you exist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if they don't know about us as an </v>

326
00:17:11.821 --> 00:17:12.654
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they don't know that thousands of </v>

327
00:17:13.801 --> 00:17:18.090
<v Speaker 1>people live off creating content online,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they will not understand how many people</v>

328
00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:21.180
<v Speaker 1>might get unemployed because of a bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulation.</v>

329
00:17:21.210 --> 00:17:22.043
<v Speaker 1>So if you liked this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rather than asking you to subscribe </v>

330
00:17:23.851 --> 00:17:24.684
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suggest that you share it with a </v>

331

<v Speaker 1>friend as a creator of Fanny European,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hopefully someone who will help make a </v>

332
00:17:29.461 --> 00:17:31.290
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at some point in the future,</v>

333
00:17:31.291 --> 00:17:33.030
<v Speaker 1>we're probably going to need to act on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

334
00:17:33.031 --> 00:17:36.690
<v Speaker 1>And here are visual politic.</v>
