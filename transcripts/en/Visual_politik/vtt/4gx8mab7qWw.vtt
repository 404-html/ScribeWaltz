1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.900
<v Speaker 1>How can the country overcome a crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can it reinvents itself,</v>

2
00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:04.763
<v Speaker 1>change itself and transform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are two of the questions you have </v>

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.180
<v Speaker 1>asked us in the comments section here on</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic as well as a viewer.</v>

4
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.570
<v Speaker 1>I think we can say that the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>usually evolves three cycles.</v>

5
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:16.433
<v Speaker 1>That is a growth phase is sooner or </v>
<v Speaker 1>laser always followed by a crisis and </v>

6
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:24.801
<v Speaker 1>then this crisis is followed again by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>new growth phase and so on and so</v>

7
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.053
<v Speaker 2>both.</v>

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.600
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since World War Two,</v>

9
00:00:31.601 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>the United States has undergone 11 </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete economic cycles.</v>

10
00:00:35.051 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>That is both growth and crisis years.</v>

11
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.540
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.670
<v Speaker 1>How has my friends things on always have</v>
<v Speaker 1>that simple?</v>

13
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes leaving a crisis is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very hard.</v>

14
00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:46.474
<v Speaker 1>So much so that decades could go by so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much so that even a rich and prosperous </v>

15
00:00:51.161 --> 00:00:51.994
<v Speaker 1>country can stop being a rich and </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperous country because don't think </v>

16
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.780
<v Speaker 1>that this only effects emerging </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

17
00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.823
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The richest countries can suffer this </v>

18
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:05.144
<v Speaker 1>type of deep crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually due to political reasons or </v>

19
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:09.254
<v Speaker 1>rather bad policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he has to view our country can't </v>

20
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.780
<v Speaker 1>even escape these deepest of crises or </v>
<v Speaker 1>his hair on visual politic with,</v>

21
00:01:19.511 --> 00:01:21.250
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case of New Zealand's,</v>

22
00:01:21.251 --> 00:01:23.740
<v Speaker 1>which after undergoing a very harsh </v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>

23
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>managed to completely overturn the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>

24
00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.150
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

25
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:30.983
<v Speaker 1>in this video we're going to show you </v>
<v Speaker 1>another example and that would be the </v>

26
00:01:33.901 --> 00:01:35.580
<v Speaker 1>example of Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

27
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.473
<v Speaker 1>You heard me right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that Canada almost went </v>

28
00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:39.660
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:40.523
<v Speaker 1>if you didn't listen up Canada is one of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the richest freest and most prosperous </v>

30
00:01:52.901 --> 00:01:55.870
<v Speaker 1>countries with the highest quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>life on the planet.</v>

31
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:01.020
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't even matter what ranking we </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

32
00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:01.854
<v Speaker 1>It can be the United Nations Hdi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corruption perception index of </v>

33
00:02:04.501 --> 00:02:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Transparency International,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Fraser Institute,</v>

34
00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:09.203
<v Speaker 1>Human Freedom Index,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the legatum prosperity index in all </v>

35
00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:12.564
<v Speaker 1>of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada is always among the highest on </v>

36
00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:17.010
<v Speaker 1>the list,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this video isn't about rankings,</v>

37
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:17.844
<v Speaker 1>but before we move on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just do want to touch on one last one </v>

38
00:02:20.071 --> 00:02:20.904
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See in the latest ranking of the best </v>

39
00:02:24.061 --> 00:02:24.894
<v Speaker 1>countries prepared to buy us news </v>
<v Speaker 1>magazine and the Wharton School Canada </v>

40
00:02:27.661 --> 00:02:31.500
<v Speaker 1>appears as the second best country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in in the world.</v>

41
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.750
<v Speaker 1>Pretty clear as we already saw it on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this channel,</v>

42
00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.160
<v Speaker 1>that Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>

43
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.920
<v Speaker 1>is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very popular right now.</v>

44
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.670
<v Speaker 1>How are the things in Canada once always</v>
<v Speaker 1>this happy?</v>

45
00:02:46.671 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>There was a time in the 1960s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the 1970s where everything</v>

46
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.410
<v Speaker 1>was about to collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disaster.</v>

47
00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:06.680
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can I do?</v>

48
00:03:06.681 --> 00:03:08.880
<v Speaker 1>It was very similar to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

49
00:03:08.881 --> 00:03:13.881
<v Speaker 1>It was practically it's twin brother.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had a very small governments.</v>

50
00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.670
<v Speaker 1>The country was very decentralized and </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes were very similar.</v>

51
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.563
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea then was to compete to attract </v>

52
00:03:20.101 --> 00:03:22.590
<v Speaker 1>investments and thus also people from </v>
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>

53
00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:24.900
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

54
00:03:24.901 --> 00:03:28.050
<v Speaker 1>this all changed in the 1960s at that </v>
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>

55
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:28.884
<v Speaker 1>Canada sought to distance itself from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States and to try a new </v>

56
00:03:32.221 --> 00:03:33.054
<v Speaker 1>political and economic model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The great architects of this revolution </v>

57
00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.040
<v Speaker 1>was Pierre Trudeau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

58
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.080
<v Speaker 1>That's the father of the current prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister,</v>

59
00:03:40.081 --> 00:03:40.914
<v Speaker 1>Justin Trudeau.</v>

60
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.850
<v Speaker 3>We can forever spend more than we </v>
<v Speaker 3>obtained from tax.</v>

61
00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.540
<v Speaker 1>Of course father and sons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politics aren't by no means the same.</v>

62
00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 1>It looks like just trudeau sets and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>did his homework,</v>

63
00:03:59.151 --> 00:04:01.700
<v Speaker 1>but let's not straight from the subject </v>
<v Speaker 1>too much.</v>

64
00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:07.493
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that just introduce father </v>
<v Speaker 1>govern Canada virtually uninterrupted </v>

65
00:04:10.741 --> 00:04:15.741
<v Speaker 1>between 1968 in 1984 and the fact is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that throughout the 16 years in power,</v>

66
00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.750
<v Speaker 1>the country changed a great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today I've seen you out once.</v>

67
00:04:20.751 --> 00:04:22.980
<v Speaker 1>You do implement a new political model </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Canada,</v>

68
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:23.843
<v Speaker 1>which was a bit difference from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington's capitalism and somewhat </v>

69
00:04:26.581 --> 00:04:27.414
<v Speaker 1>closer to Sylvia Moscow's collectivism </v>
<v Speaker 1>as against the invisible hand of Adam </v>

70
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:33.443
<v Speaker 1>Smith,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there has to be a visible hand of </v>

71
00:04:34.261 --> 00:04:35.094
<v Speaker 1>politicians whose objective it is to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the kind of society that is caring </v>

72
00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.890
<v Speaker 1>and humane.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pierre Trudeau in facts in international</v>

73
00:04:40.891 --> 00:04:42.810
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the things the prime minister was</v>

74
00:04:42.811 --> 00:04:46.380
<v Speaker 1>best known for was his close friendship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Fidel Castro.</v>

75
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.033
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that we could say that </v>

76
00:04:51.871 --> 00:04:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau's father went a bit far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he raised taxes a lot.</v>

77
00:04:56.701 --> 00:04:59.640
<v Speaker 1>He increased public spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he nationalized companies.</v>

78
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.503
<v Speaker 1>And because he thought that all </v>
<v Speaker 1>international trade and investment was </v>

79
00:05:03.001 --> 00:05:06.570
<v Speaker 1>bad due to competition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he decided to set up barriers.</v>

80
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:11.490
<v Speaker 1>So speaking of barriers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well who does that sound like?</v>

81
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.603
<v Speaker 1>President trump slap new tariffs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>imported washing machines and solar </v>

82
00:05:16.171 --> 00:05:17.610
<v Speaker 1>panels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that wasn't enough,</v>

83
00:05:17.611 --> 00:05:18.444
<v Speaker 1>he also made the central bank prints </v>
<v Speaker 1>banknotes despair to expand credit and </v>

84
00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>finance the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

85
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.850
<v Speaker 1>maybe this recipe is starting to sound a</v>
<v Speaker 1>bit familiar to you.</v>

86
00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:27.723
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela's adding more zeroes to its </v>

87
00:05:28.951 --> 00:05:29.784
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it releasing bills with larger </v>

88
00:05:31.051 --> 00:05:36.051
<v Speaker 1>denominations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:38.620
<v Speaker 1>the results of all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divya,</v>

90
00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:40.800
<v Speaker 1>is that within a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deficits,</v>

91
00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:41.693
<v Speaker 1>unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and inflation rates to put the whole </v>

92
00:05:43.261 --> 00:05:47.640
<v Speaker 1>country up against the ropes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course when in 1984 Pierre Trudeau</v>

93
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:48.474
<v Speaker 1>left office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he did see with the lowest popularity </v>

94
00:05:50.641 --> 00:05:53.850
<v Speaker 1>level for a Canadian prime minister in </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

95
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.000
<v Speaker 1>only two out of every 10 Canadians still</v>
<v Speaker 1>supported him.</v>

96
00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.740
<v Speaker 1>And it was at this time that Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens have to make a really important</v>

97
00:06:00.741 --> 00:06:05.741
<v Speaker 1>decision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The chain in the September,</v>

98
00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.493
<v Speaker 1>1984 elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conservatives won an overwhelming </v>

99
00:06:16.361 --> 00:06:17.194
<v Speaker 1>victory.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that the country could not </v>

100
00:06:18.611 --> 00:06:21.430
<v Speaker 1>continue along Trudeau's path.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new prime minister,</v>

101
00:06:21.431 --> 00:06:22.264
<v Speaker 1>Brian Mulroney,</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to reverse the situation and </v>

102
00:06:24.521 --> 00:06:27.070
<v Speaker 1>began to strengthen ties with President </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ronald Reagan.</v>

103
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:31.870
<v Speaker 1>A new era had begun over the next 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

104
00:06:31.871 --> 00:06:35.920
<v Speaker 1>The conservative government did many </v>
<v Speaker 1>things to improve Canada's economy.</v>

105
00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:40.570
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lower taxes negotiated NAFTA,</v>

106
00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.300
<v Speaker 1>the North American free trade agreements</v>
<v Speaker 1>that Unites Canada,</v>

107
00:06:43.301 --> 00:06:44.134
<v Speaker 1>the u s and Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and following in Margaret Thatcher's </v>

108
00:06:45.791 --> 00:06:46.624
<v Speaker 1>footsteps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they launched an ambitious plan to </v>

109
00:06:48.281 --> 00:06:52.480
<v Speaker 1>privatize large public companies such as</v>
<v Speaker 1>Air Canada and its Petro Canada.</v>

110
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:54.230
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

111
00:06:54.230 --> 00:06:55.670
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he didn't do one thing,</v>

112
00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>the most difficult and some popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>action,</v>

113
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and that was controlling public </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending.</v>

114
00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.220
<v Speaker 1>In 1990 the state held more than half of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economy taxes.</v>

115
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.113
<v Speaker 1>We're still very high and there was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge public deficits and further public </v>

116
00:07:08.421 --> 00:07:09.254
<v Speaker 1>debt rose rapidly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Conservatives had taken the easiest </v>

117
00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:13.064
<v Speaker 1>measures bus at the moment of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They hadn't really shown much </v>

118
00:07:15.981 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 1>commitments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

119
00:07:16.941 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 1>in the following 1993 elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Piatra jury is leftist Liberal Party won</v>

120
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:21.494
<v Speaker 1>the elections again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time it promising a true </v>

121
00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could Pediatric Dose Party Save Canada</v>

122
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 2>given it</v>

123
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:34.630
<v Speaker 1>backgrounds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You cons and I,</v>

124
00:07:34.631 --> 00:07:37.480
<v Speaker 1>this would have been very difficult to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine.</v>

125
00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:38.410
<v Speaker 1>That's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

126
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:40.600
<v Speaker 1>everything was really different at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>

127
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:41.493
<v Speaker 1>The new governments wanted to completely</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the country's model once and for </v>

128
00:07:44.771 --> 00:07:45.604
<v Speaker 1>all and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they no longer wanted anything to do </v>

129
00:07:47.711 --> 00:07:48.544
<v Speaker 1>with Moscow or the Soviet model is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main idea was that quality of life </v>

130
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.550
<v Speaker 1>wasn't only related to the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was dependent on it.</v>

131
00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:56.800
<v Speaker 1>If they wanted to achieve on a quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life,</v>

132
00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>they needed to strengthen Canada's </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy and that's essentially what they</v>

133
00:08:00.491 --> 00:08:01.324
<v Speaker 1>did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially under the minister of </v>

134
00:08:02.321 --> 00:08:03.880
<v Speaker 1>Finance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Martin feet,</v>

135
00:08:03.881 --> 00:08:07.280
<v Speaker 1>true change promoter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:08:07.281 --> 00:08:08.750
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that for the first few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

137
00:08:08.751 --> 00:08:12.110
<v Speaker 1>the leftist government launched a sharp </v>
<v Speaker 1>public spending cuts,</v>

138
00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.380
<v Speaker 1>eliminated many unnecessary programs and</v>
<v Speaker 1>adjusted spending.</v>

139
00:08:15.470 --> 00:08:18.170
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these strongly reduced military spending</v>

140
00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.460
<v Speaker 1>and many companies subsidy</v>

141
00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:22.243
<v Speaker 1>just two years in real times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending drops by 15% under the </v>

142
00:08:25.911 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which states that the state shouldn't do</v>

143
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:29.024
<v Speaker 1>things that companies can do better if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government decided to continue with </v>

144
00:08:31.941 --> 00:08:32.774
<v Speaker 1>the privatization plan in which they </v>
<v Speaker 1>went as far as privatizing the railways </v>

145
00:08:36.201 --> 00:08:37.034
<v Speaker 1>and even the aviation management system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anne's no planes in Canada did not fall </v>

146
00:08:40.371 --> 00:08:41.204
<v Speaker 1>out of the sky and no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there haven't been more accidents than </v>

147
00:08:42.951 --> 00:08:44.570
<v Speaker 1>they have been in other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>

148
00:08:44.571 --> 00:08:45.404
<v Speaker 1>on the contrary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada's aviation management system is </v>

149
00:08:47.301 --> 00:08:51.890
<v Speaker 1>considered one of the best in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that in just four years,</v>

150
00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:52.753
<v Speaker 1>the situation was under control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The governments had gone from having a </v>

151
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:57.780
<v Speaker 1>deficits to having a sub lists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

152
00:08:57.810 --> 00:08:58.890
<v Speaker 1>check out this graphic.</v>

153
00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:05.540
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>

154
00:09:05.541 --> 00:09:07.130
<v Speaker 1>these measures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they weren't easy.</v>

155
00:09:07.131 --> 00:09:11.420
<v Speaker 1>But one thing that seemed to be very </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear to Canadians say much so if that's</v>

156
00:09:11.421 --> 00:09:12.254
<v Speaker 1>in the 1997 elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the liberal leftist party won again by </v>

157
00:09:15.471 --> 00:09:19.340
<v Speaker 1>promising still more careful and </v>
<v Speaker 1>government spending and on this occasion</v>

158
00:09:19.460 --> 00:09:20.293
<v Speaker 1>fewer taxes as they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their role was to protect and give </v>

159
00:09:22.701 --> 00:09:23.534
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>disenfranchised and not to waste </v>

160
00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.850
<v Speaker 1>everyone's money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It all seems pretty sensible,</v>

161
00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.721
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:09:29.721 --> 00:09:34.190
<v Speaker 1>listen to Paul Martin's words in 2003 as</v>
<v Speaker 1>he reviewed that 10 years in power,</v>

163
00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:35.520
<v Speaker 1>we have to build it.</v>

164
00:09:35.520 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 5>21st century economy in Canada for </v>
<v Speaker 5>Canadians.</v>

165
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:39.143
<v Speaker 5>We succeeded in the last 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 5>because we did not deviate from our </v>

166
00:09:41.371 --> 00:09:42.870
<v Speaker 5>course.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Balanced budgets,</v>

167
00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.790
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>continually dropping debt ratio,</v>

168
00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.520
<v Speaker 5>lower taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We must stay on that course.</v>

169
00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:51.210
<v Speaker 5>We must be a government committed to </v>
<v Speaker 5>accountability of government that treats</v>

170
00:09:51.211 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 5>taxpayers' money like it is your money,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Paul Martin.</v>

171
00:09:54.150 --> 00:09:58.590
<v Speaker 5>This revolution was a real turning </v>
<v Speaker 5>points in Canada's history.</v>

172
00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:03.720
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

173
00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 1>to the country experienced in the 1980s </v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially in the 90s,</v>

174
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:16.140
<v Speaker 1>allowed for this country's situation to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change completely.</v>

175
00:10:16.170 --> 00:10:17.003
<v Speaker 1>Canada went from being considered an </v>
<v Speaker 1>honorary member of the Third World by </v>

176
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:20.784
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal due to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>public debt problems to becoming the </v>

177
00:10:23.551 --> 00:10:24.384
<v Speaker 1>most fashionable country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll potsy howdens only solve the </v>

178
00:10:31.941 --> 00:10:32.774
<v Speaker 1>country's problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had changed its model in the </v>

179
00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:36.383
<v Speaker 1>following years up until today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all political options opt for the </v>

180
00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:39.680
<v Speaker 1>Canadian model.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mind you,</v>

181
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:40.543
<v Speaker 1>Canada is no tax haven far from us </v>
<v Speaker 1>because they have understood that </v>

182
00:10:43.341 --> 00:10:46.520
<v Speaker 1>companies need to be cared for and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not punished.</v>

183
00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:47.010
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

184
00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:47.843
<v Speaker 2>Jobs</v>

185
00:10:52.550 --> 00:10:53.383
<v Speaker 1>you had that rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we take all taxes that companies pay </v>

186
00:10:55.341 --> 00:10:56.174
<v Speaker 1>into accounts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country situation is actually very </v>

187
00:10:58.131 --> 00:10:59.480
<v Speaker 1>advantageous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

188
00:10:59.481 --> 00:11:00.314
<v Speaker 1>Canada is one of the few developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that has been decreasing as </v>

189
00:11:02.571 --> 00:11:03.404
<v Speaker 1>taxes for almost 20 years to make the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country more competitive and consider </v>

190
00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:07.643
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how company taxes have evolved and this </v>

191
00:11:15.271 --> 00:11:16.104
<v Speaker 1>policy has mostly favored.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weakest salaries have grown a lot </v>

192
00:11:18.900 --> 00:11:19.733
<v Speaker 1>and this is one of the countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>receives the most immigrants and </v>

193
00:11:21.991 --> 00:11:25.990
<v Speaker 1>employment rates are very high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>

194
00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.000
<v Speaker 1>if all of this weren't enough in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years,</v>

195
00:11:28.001 --> 00:11:28.834
<v Speaker 1>Canada has also become a world civil </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberties champion as we saw her a </v>

196
00:11:32.371 --> 00:11:33.940
<v Speaker 1>visual policy in a previous video.</v>

197
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 1>And this Divya is how Canada managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>escape its greatest crisis.</v>

198
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:40.473
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as it happened in New Zealand and </v>

199
00:11:42.191 --> 00:11:43.024
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these reforms were carried out by </v>

200
00:11:44.501 --> 00:11:47.560
<v Speaker 1>leftist parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this isn't about left or right.</v>

201
00:11:47.561 --> 00:11:52.420
<v Speaker 1>It's about understanding that a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive and globally open economy is</v>

202
00:11:52.421 --> 00:11:55.420
<v Speaker 1>the best to improve everyone's quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>of life.</v>

203
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 1>But having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now it's your turn.</v>

204
