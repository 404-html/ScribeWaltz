1
00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.193
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong is one of those places that </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably needs no introduction because </v>

2
00:00:11.991 --> 00:00:14.900
<v Speaker 1>you already know will have is situated </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the south of China.</v>

3
00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong is a lively bustling city with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a great deal of contrasts</v>

4
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.390
<v Speaker 2>in Hong Kong.</v>

5
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.530
<v Speaker 1>It isn't surprising to see ancient </v>
<v Speaker 1>Lori's running alongside luxury cars.</v>

6
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.393
<v Speaker 1>You'll also see ruins buildings right </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to fancy modern skyscrapers and </v>

7
00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:35.130
<v Speaker 1>you'll see top notch restaurants next to</v>
<v Speaker 1>street food cars.</v>

8
00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.230
<v Speaker 1>They all do have one thing in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They occupy tiny spaces.</v>

9
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.093
<v Speaker 1>This is true whether the location is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>high ends mold or just a traditional </v>

10
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.033
<v Speaker 1>storefronts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whatever business you operate in Hong </v>

11
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.753
<v Speaker 1>Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most is made of every single square </v>

12
00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:50.514
<v Speaker 1>meter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong was one of the biggest </v>

13
00:00:56.391 --> 00:00:58.610
<v Speaker 1>miracles of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

14
00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:02.420
<v Speaker 1>it was the model Milton Friedman himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>looked at in order to prove his pro free</v>

15
00:01:02.421 --> 00:01:03.254
<v Speaker 1>trade thesis.</v>

16
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.330
<v Speaker 2>Free market really is obliged to come.</v>

17
00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.040
<v Speaker 1>World Water You,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong's population.</v>

18
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:13.400
<v Speaker 1>It was around 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

19
00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.660
<v Speaker 1>It has an income equivalent to about a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quarter of the United Kingdom's 60 years</v>

20
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:22.070
<v Speaker 1>later and the population now exceeds 7 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million people and the per capita income</v>

21
00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.460
<v Speaker 1>is almost equal to the UK.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When purchasing power is considered,</v>

22
00:01:25.461 --> 00:01:28.040
<v Speaker 1>its GDP is much larger than the one in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK.</v>

23
00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.943
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.410
<v Speaker 1>Sixty years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong has not only become the fourth</v>

25
00:01:36.411 --> 00:01:37.244
<v Speaker 1>most significant financial center in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and one of the 10 most important </v>

26
00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:40.994
<v Speaker 1>markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it has also become a shell sap and </v>

27
00:01:42.441 --> 00:01:43.274
<v Speaker 1>millions of Chinese citizens through </v>
<v Speaker 1>escapes the poverty and violence of </v>

28
00:01:46.011 --> 00:01:46.844
<v Speaker 1>Mao's China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all the economic development is </v>

29
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>economic freedom is something that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can really feel in the air in Hong Kong.</v>

30
00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:54.980
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong cannot exactly be considered a</v>

31
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:55.814
<v Speaker 1>free paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nowadays it can be considered the </v>

32
00:01:57.831 --> 00:01:58.664
<v Speaker 1>freest economy in the world and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth easiest place to do business in </v>

33
00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:02.594
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

34
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.800
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>

35
00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:08.633
<v Speaker 1>the kings are Hong Kong's economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>development is going to be discussed in </v>

36
00:02:11.131 --> 00:02:11.964
<v Speaker 1>a future video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but today we're going to focus on the </v>

37
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:14.663
<v Speaker 1>politics of Hong Kong and the threats </v>
<v Speaker 1>against its institutional structure </v>

38
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.730
<v Speaker 1>which might even compromise its future </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic development.</v>

39
00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.593
<v Speaker 1>And to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're gonna have to start by looking at </v>

40
00:02:23.131 --> 00:02:23.964
<v Speaker 1>the great paradox that China is facing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the paradox which has become something </v>

41
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.560
<v Speaker 1>of a hallmark for the country.</v>

42
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.990
<v Speaker 2>Ongoing Kong</v>

43
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.330
<v Speaker 1>was a British colony until 1997 when the</v>
<v Speaker 1>city integrated into China.</v>

44
00:02:38.331 --> 00:02:39.164
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that hadn't happened </v>

45
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:40.783
<v Speaker 1>since the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China was and today remains a </v>

46
00:02:43.191 --> 00:02:44.024
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lacking respect for human rights and </v>

47
00:02:45.561 --> 00:02:46.394
<v Speaker 1>having very few civil liberties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This forced the governments in London </v>

48
00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 1>and Beijing to negotiate a solution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The citizens of Hong Kong didn't want to</v>

49
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:54.554
<v Speaker 1>lose that fundamental rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and London simply couldn't tolerate the </v>

50
00:02:57.081 --> 00:02:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Chinese applying their authoritarians of</v>

51
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:00.933
<v Speaker 2>city</v>

52
00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 1>negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1984,</v>

53
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.360
<v Speaker 1>they reached an agreement known as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sino British joint declaration,</v>

54
00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.450
<v Speaker 1>which established for 50 years after the</v>
<v Speaker 1>integration,</v>

55
00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:14.313
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong would have a different </v>
<v Speaker 1>political system than the one in </v>

56
00:03:16.751 --> 00:03:19.780
<v Speaker 1>mainland China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This meant that after 1997,</v>

57
00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:20.643
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong became a special </v>
<v Speaker 1>administrative region where these so </v>

58
00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:26.270
<v Speaker 1>called basic law replies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a lot of the grants,</v>

59
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.400
<v Speaker 1>its citizens' rights and freedoms that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be unimaginable in any other place</v>

60
00:03:30.401 --> 00:03:31.234
<v Speaker 1>in China with the exception of Macau </v>
<v Speaker 1>which was integrated into China </v>

61
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:34.444
<v Speaker 1>following the same model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the citizens in Hong Kong have freedom </v>

62
00:03:36.251 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>of speech,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of the press,</v>

63
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.390
<v Speaker 1>freedom of publication,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom of Assembly and association,</v>

64
00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>and it's even freedom of demonstration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

65
00:03:42.641 --> 00:03:43.474
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong has its own currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its own immigration policy and customs </v>

66
00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:46.864
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its own police and even has its own </v>

67
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.070
<v Speaker 1>courts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at first things went really well.</v>

68
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.310
<v Speaker 1>Following this policy and the economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth we mentioned earlier,</v>

69
00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.340
<v Speaker 1>certainly did help the citizens cap that</v>
<v Speaker 1>reign free status.</v>

70
00:03:57.341 --> 00:03:58.174
<v Speaker 1>They could apply their own policies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong became the natural entrance </v>

71
00:04:01.271 --> 00:04:02.720
<v Speaker 1>for foreign investment into</v>

72
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:03.653
<v Speaker 2>China</v>

73
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.170
<v Speaker 1>for a few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things started to get rather worse.</v>

74
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.313
<v Speaker 1>The basic law we mentioned a moment ago </v>
<v Speaker 1>acknowledges civil rights but not civil </v>

75
00:04:18.941 --> 00:04:20.110
<v Speaker 1>democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

76
00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>China has control over the parliaments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the city's executive power.</v>

77
00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.840
<v Speaker 1>So how did they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:04:25.841 --> 00:04:26.674
<v Speaker 1>first in Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only half of the MPS are chosen through </v>

79
00:04:29.141 --> 00:04:29.974
<v Speaker 1>the popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other half were chosen by a closed </v>

80
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:34.770
<v Speaker 1>group formed of entrepreneurs and </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions close to China</v>

81
00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.730
<v Speaker 3>now watching Jolyon separatists arguing </v>
<v Speaker 3>for independence from China.</v>

82
00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.880
<v Speaker 3>They were excluded from the chamber for </v>
<v Speaker 3>using offensive language.</v>

83
00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.680
<v Speaker 1>There is the head of the executive </v>
<v Speaker 1>branch,</v>

84
00:04:46.681 --> 00:04:50.010
<v Speaker 1>and that's the prime minister who was </v>
<v Speaker 1>chosen by a committee of 1000,</v>

85
00:04:50.011 --> 00:04:50.844
<v Speaker 1>200 people involved or Linkedin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one way or another to the communist </v>

86
00:04:53.401 --> 00:04:54.690
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to that,</v>

87
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:58.920
<v Speaker 1>all public officials must take an oath </v>
<v Speaker 1>of allegiance and commitments to China.</v>

88
00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.900
<v Speaker 1>Because of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's an argument to be made that some</v>

89
00:05:00.901 --> 00:05:03.030
<v Speaker 1>of these positions are actually in </v>
<v Speaker 1>legitimate.</v>

90
00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:03.893
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Basic Law states that the autonomy </v>

91
00:05:06.001 --> 00:05:09.390
<v Speaker 1>of Hong Kong is subordinate to Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>people's congrats,</v>

92
00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.740
<v Speaker 1>special administrative region of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>People's Republic of China.</v>

93
00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:23.641
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the trees,</v>

94
00:05:23.641 --> 00:05:24.474
<v Speaker 1>he demanded that from 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the executive chief hat to be chosen by </v>

95
00:05:28.131 --> 00:05:28.964
<v Speaker 1>popular vote,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this leads us to the part of the </v>

96
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:31.814
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When China started to break their word </v>

97
00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:35.210
<v Speaker 1>over and over again,</v>

98
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:41.260
<v Speaker 2>the 31st</v>

99
00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:42.640
<v Speaker 1>of August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2014,</v>

100
00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.060
<v Speaker 1>the national congress in Beijing started</v>
<v Speaker 1>the electoral reform,</v>

101
00:05:46.061 --> 00:05:48.700
<v Speaker 1>which would choose the government chief </v>
<v Speaker 1>in this special region,</v>

102
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.010
<v Speaker 1>and here was the surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

103
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.070
<v Speaker 1>Beijing did acknowledge that this should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be chosen by popular vote,</v>

104
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:54.963
<v Speaker 1>but they could only choose between two </v>
<v Speaker 1>or three who had been previously </v>

105
00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.090
<v Speaker 1>selected by the Communist Party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

106
00:06:01.091 --> 00:06:01.924
<v Speaker 1>Some surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese do have a rather different </v>

107
00:06:04.011 --> 00:06:04.844
<v Speaker 1>idea of democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so over the next few days the people </v>

108
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.430
<v Speaker 1>really started rising up first.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were protests by students,</v>

109
00:06:10.431 --> 00:06:11.264
<v Speaker 1>some of them as young as 17 years old.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you explain to a young educated </v>

110
00:06:18.371 --> 00:06:22.330
<v Speaker 1>students who grew up with full access to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet and the media that they are</v>

111
00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 1>actually going to have to live under a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese dictatorship after all</v>

112
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:26.373
<v Speaker 4>and 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 4>I believe that will be more </v>

113
00:06:28.061 --> 00:06:28.894
<v Speaker 4>demonstrations and protests,</v>
<v Speaker 4>especially under the interface of </v>

114
00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.103
<v Speaker 4>Beijing government,</v>
<v Speaker 4>is just proved the failure of one </v>

115
00:06:34.061 --> 00:06:34.960
<v Speaker 4>country,</v>
<v Speaker 4>two system</v>

116
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:36.273
<v Speaker 1>reaction to the authorities to these </v>
<v Speaker 1>first strikes and mobilizations wasn't </v>

117
00:06:39.001 --> 00:06:41.700
<v Speaker 1>very friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided to use force,</v>

118
00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:42.563
<v Speaker 1>but the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the opposite of what they were </v>

119
00:06:44.341 --> 00:06:47.010
<v Speaker 1>expecting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead of containing the protests,</v>

120
00:06:47.011 --> 00:06:49.020
<v Speaker 1>more and more people took to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>streets,</v>

121
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:49.883
<v Speaker 1>moved by the fear of having to remain </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the rule of Beijing in a short </v>

122
00:06:52.981 --> 00:06:53.814
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge demonstration developed in the </v>

123
00:06:55.201 --> 00:06:56.034
<v Speaker 1>center of Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I did many of the organizations occupy </v>

124
00:06:58.171 --> 00:06:59.630
<v Speaker 1>central and scholar Ism,</v>

125
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:02.040
<v Speaker 4>not only me,</v>
<v Speaker 4>oh well,</v>

126
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 4>let's go home until feel we awake at </v>
<v Speaker 4>bluff.</v>

127
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.850
<v Speaker 1>Police started using tear gas and pepper</v>
<v Speaker 1>spray to control the protesters,</v>

128
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.470
<v Speaker 1>and the population started using towels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mosques,</v>

129
00:07:11.471 --> 00:07:13.750
<v Speaker 1>and umbrellas to mitigate the effect of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the gas.</v>

130
00:07:13.780 --> 00:07:14.613
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the protests actually became known as </v>

131
00:07:16.331 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>the umbrella.</v>

132
00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:21.660
<v Speaker 2>You should.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The occupation</v>

133
00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:22.493
<v Speaker 1>of central Hong Kong lasted for 79 days </v>
<v Speaker 1>and since then the conflict has </v>

134
00:07:26.461 --> 00:07:27.294
<v Speaker 1>continued with some spontaneous </v>
<v Speaker 1>outbreaks and young people getting more </v>

135
00:07:29.851 --> 00:07:31.980
<v Speaker 1>radical and not just demanding </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>

136
00:07:32.010 --> 00:07:35.490
<v Speaker 1>but demanding independence from China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something,</v>

137
00:07:35.491 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that China has said that they absolutely</v>

138
00:07:37.681 --> 00:07:39.960
<v Speaker 1>will not tolerate under any </v>
<v Speaker 1>circumstances,</v>

139
00:07:39.990 --> 00:07:43.230
<v Speaker 1>even if they have to use military force.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an interesting aside,</v>

140
00:07:43.231 --> 00:07:43.710
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

141
00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:44.543
<v Speaker 1>China has recently kidnapped five </v>
<v Speaker 1>librarians in Hong Kong for spreading </v>

142
00:07:47.371 --> 00:07:49.410
<v Speaker 1>ideas against Chinese control of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city.</v>

143
00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:50.293
<v Speaker 5>I was visiting my girlfriend in the </v>
<v Speaker 5>mainland and I was stopped by two </v>

144
00:07:52.691 --> 00:07:55.690
<v Speaker 5>officials at the border.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They took me to a police fan where there</v>

145
00:07:55.691 --> 00:07:57.520
<v Speaker 5>were dozens of policemen waiting up to </v>
<v Speaker 5>you.</v>

146
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.473
<v Speaker 5>Then I was taken to the police station </v>
<v Speaker 5>in Schengen when I was held in the </v>

147
00:08:00.941 --> 00:08:03.620
<v Speaker 5>prisoners compound and interrogated </v>
<v Speaker 5>largely</v>

148
00:08:03.640 --> 00:08:04.473
<v Speaker 1>because of these protests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The September 2016 elections were </v>

149
00:08:07.031 --> 00:08:10.430
<v Speaker 1>celebrated as many of the protests </v>
<v Speaker 1>leaders were chosen as mps.</v>

150
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:11.283
<v Speaker 1>There are antibodies using pro </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence positions have opened up </v>

151
00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:16.210
<v Speaker 1>the conflict door again since September </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

152
00:08:16.211 --> 00:08:17.044
<v Speaker 1>mps have already been expelled from </v>
<v Speaker 1>their offices under pressure for </v>

153
00:08:19.181 --> 00:08:19.710
<v Speaker 1>maintenance</v>

154
00:08:19.710 --> 00:08:20.543
<v Speaker 2>China,</v>

155
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.530
<v Speaker 1>and as I mentioned earlier in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

156
00:08:40.531 --> 00:08:43.440
<v Speaker 1>civil rights are only protected in Hong </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kong until 20,</v>

157
00:08:43.441 --> 00:08:44.274
<v Speaker 1>47 and it seems that every day China's </v>
<v Speaker 1>involvement in the city grows and grows </v>

158
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:48.773
<v Speaker 1>and this does come with a price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Potential investors in China through </v>

159
00:08:51.661 --> 00:08:52.494
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong starting to perceive a risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is probably one of the why </v>

160
00:08:55.471 --> 00:08:59.190
<v Speaker 1>Singapore has experienced such strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth in the last few years,</v>

161
00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:01.110
<v Speaker 1>so that's what we think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what do you think?</v>

162
00:09:01.111 --> 00:09:03.870
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the citizens in Hong Kong </v>
<v Speaker 1>should fight for their freedom?</v>

163
00:09:03.871 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 1>Do you think China will eventually </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely controlled Hong Kong?</v>

164
00:09:06.511 --> 00:09:08.970
