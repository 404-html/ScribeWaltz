1
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.220
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten a stone is a difficult </v>
<v Speaker 1>country then many aspects,</v>

2
00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.790
<v Speaker 1>difficult honestly doesn't really cover </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

3
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.770
<v Speaker 1>I've gotten a stone is a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountainous country.</v>

4
00:00:16.771 --> 00:00:17.604
<v Speaker 1>Almost three quarters of its surface is </v>
<v Speaker 1>covered by mountains and peaks that in </v>

5
00:00:20.311 --> 00:00:23.550
<v Speaker 1>many cases exceed 20,000 feet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cause then you can probably imagine just</v>

6
00:00:23.551 --> 00:00:27.110
<v Speaker 1>how difficult communications are among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the different regions of this country as</v>

7
00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.953
<v Speaker 1>if this was not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also a landlocked and it's mostly </v>

8
00:00:30.091 --> 00:00:31.350
<v Speaker 1>Erin's place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

9
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.720
<v Speaker 1>deserts are not unusual at all in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan</v>

10
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.603
<v Speaker 2>stop.</v>

11
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.463
<v Speaker 1>So despite a few valleys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's national landscape is mainly </v>

12
00:00:41.661 --> 00:00:42.494
<v Speaker 1>composed of red and yellow tones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But geography is not the worst part of </v>

13
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.130
<v Speaker 1>this country and neither is a task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Climate conditions not at all.</v>

14
00:00:49.131 --> 00:00:50.060
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>

15
00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 1>corruption and especially fundamentalism</v>
<v Speaker 1>and violence,</v>

16
00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:54.014
<v Speaker 1>all the worst parts of this place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan's if you are above all as a </v>

17
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:58.304
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

18
00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:59.583
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

19
00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.503
<v Speaker 3>1978 the sour revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a communist space revolution took place </v>

20
00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:05.783
<v Speaker 3>when you're later in 1979 the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 3>army invaded the country to consolidate </v>

21
00:01:09.271 --> 00:01:10.104
<v Speaker 3>the communist government</v>

22
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.340
<v Speaker 2>since</v>

23
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.650
<v Speaker 1>send the people have not known what </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace means,</v>

24
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:19.700
<v Speaker 1>but before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be honest,</v>

25
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>the situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't really good either.</v>

26
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.980
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan was his ends probably will </v>
<v Speaker 1>be for a long time,</v>

27
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.993
<v Speaker 1>one of the poorest countries on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also got one of the hardest and </v>

28
00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.390
<v Speaker 1>most hostile living conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for women</v>

29
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:35.503
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six out of every 10 people don't know </v>

30
00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:37.314
<v Speaker 1>how to read or rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost half of its population doesn't </v>

31
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:39.854
<v Speaker 1>have access to drinking water and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult to find a single family which </v>

32
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:45.410
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been devastated by war and </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>

33
00:01:45.411 --> 00:01:46.244
<v Speaker 1>We can safely say that if someone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>able to choose where they were to be </v>

34
00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:51.470
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no one would ever choose Afghanistan.</v>

35
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.410
<v Speaker 1>The last grade conflicts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which still persists to this day,</v>

36
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.283
<v Speaker 1>it burst onto the global stage in </v>
<v Speaker 1>October of 2001 when the president of </v>

37
00:01:58.611 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 1>the United States at the time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>George W.</v>

38
00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.340
<v Speaker 1>Bush decided to invade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan has a response to nine 11 at</v>

39
00:02:04.341 --> 00:02:06.530
<v Speaker 1>that time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan was led by the Taliban,</v>

40
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.280
<v Speaker 1>a radical religious political group,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which protected members of al Qaeda,</v>

41
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.880
<v Speaker 1>including a solid bin London</v>

42
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.963
<v Speaker 4>on my orders.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The United States military has begun </v>

43
00:02:15.371 --> 00:02:16.204
<v Speaker 4>strikes against al Qaeda terrorist </v>
<v Speaker 4>training camps and military </v>

44
00:02:20.021 --> 00:02:22.830
<v Speaker 4>installations of the Taliban regime in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Afghanistan.</v>

45
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.700
<v Speaker 1>The invasion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was fast.</v>

46
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.420
<v Speaker 1>The Taliban simply weren't an obstacle </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the massive American war machine.</v>

47
00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.850
<v Speaker 1>16 years and three presidents later </v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

48
00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.690
<v Speaker 1>and it has been named by many as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>longest war in US history.</v>

49
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>It's already longer than the war in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam.</v>

50
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.833
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not the u s that aren't winning that </v>

51
00:02:39.551 --> 00:02:40.384
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

52
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.470
<v Speaker 2>What's happening?</v>
<v Speaker 2>16</v>

53
00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.363
<v Speaker 1>long years of conflict,</v>
<v Speaker 1>occupation and hundreds of billions of </v>

54
00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:52.693
<v Speaker 1>dollars later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it would seem logical to think that </v>

55
00:02:53.641 --> 00:02:54.474
<v Speaker 1>the u s and NATO could have managed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the situation under control and </v>

56
00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan would be close to reaching </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace,</v>

57
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.401
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

58
00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:01.234
<v Speaker 1>nothing is further from reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that with each day that </v>

59
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:05.200
<v Speaker 1>goes by,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban regain grounds.</v>

60
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.470
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look at this map from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post.</v>

61
00:03:07.471 --> 00:03:09.600
<v Speaker 1>The colored areas are the ones </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled by the talent.</v>

62
00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.413
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

63
00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.420
<v Speaker 1>Um,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well this map shows the situation at the</v>

64
00:03:14.421 --> 00:03:18.680
<v Speaker 1>beginning of 2017 but today things are </v>
<v Speaker 1>even worse because as we just said,</v>

65
00:03:18.681 --> 00:03:21.280
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban are regaining ground almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyday day.</v>

66
00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>Recent estimates show that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments of cabal us and NATO control</v>

67
00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:29.054
<v Speaker 1>less than 60% of the territory and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next map is going to show him even more </v>

68
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:35.020
<v Speaker 1>Taliban controlled and regions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

69
00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.920
<v Speaker 3>can government controls just 57% of its </v>
<v Speaker 3>territory you s watchdog set,</v>

70
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.220
<v Speaker 1>but the loss of control by the Afghan </v>
<v Speaker 1>government seems nuts.</v>

71
00:03:42.221 --> 00:03:45.400
<v Speaker 1>The U S it shouldn't be just seen as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>territorial losses,</v>

72
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.263
<v Speaker 1>but also an economic loss for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really important that we ask </v>

73
00:03:49.031 --> 00:03:50.570
<v Speaker 1>ourselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how can the Taliban,</v>

74
00:03:50.571 --> 00:03:51.404
<v Speaker 1>it finance their activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where do all of their resources come </v>

75
00:03:54.101 --> 00:03:54.700
<v Speaker 1>from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.100
<v Speaker 1>basically that would be from heroin </v>
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>

77
00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:58.503
<v Speaker 1>As you might know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan is the biggest opm produce </v>

78
00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:01.474
<v Speaker 1>it in the whales and this opm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that's the raw ingredients that is </v>

79
00:04:04.811 --> 00:04:06.340
<v Speaker 1>used in heroin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And listen,</v>

80
00:04:06.341 --> 00:04:09.040
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan is not just the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest producer.</v>

81
00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:13.430
<v Speaker 1>It controls between 80 and 90% of opium </v>
<v Speaker 1>production globally</v>

82
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.523
<v Speaker 2>believe</v>

83
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.010
<v Speaker 3>boom,</v>
<v Speaker 3>comes from Papa Savas,</v>

84
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.863
<v Speaker 3>some different,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the most popular plant among the Afghan </v>

85
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:20.330
<v Speaker 3>opium farm.</v>

86
00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:21.163
<v Speaker 2>Sure</v>

87
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.450
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the population lives off farm</v>

88
00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:29.490
<v Speaker 1>say that most of the Afghan economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>relies on two fields.</v>

89
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:31.860
<v Speaker 1>That's international soldiers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opm.</v>

90
00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:32.753
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's little more to their economy </v>

91
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:35.400
<v Speaker 1>than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for quite a while,</v>

92
00:04:35.401 --> 00:04:38.190
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban have controls the opium </v>
<v Speaker 1>production in this country,</v>

93
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.300
<v Speaker 1>but now they also have realized that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they can produce the heroin themselves,</v>

94
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.450
<v Speaker 1>which is a much more profitable activity</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

95
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.510
<v Speaker 1>That's exactly what they do.</v>

96
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.130
<v Speaker 3>Doing everything they harvest is duly </v>
<v Speaker 3>processed inside the country.</v>

97
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.580
<v Speaker 3>They received more revenue if they </v>
<v Speaker 3>processed the opening before it has left</v>

98
00:04:53.581 --> 00:04:55.330
<v Speaker 3>the country.</v>
<v Speaker 3>William Brownfield,</v>

99
00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:59.100
<v Speaker 3>US Assistant Secretary for drugs and law</v>
<v Speaker 3>enforcement estimate is to show that the</v>

100
00:04:59.101 --> 00:05:00.410
<v Speaker 3>town of man could be raising about,</v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

101
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.333
<v Speaker 1>$3 billion every year from this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's despite all the money that </v>

102
00:05:04.371 --> 00:05:06.980
<v Speaker 1>the u s has wasted trying to stop these </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities.</v>

103
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.170
<v Speaker 1>And after this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can see from this chart,</v>

104
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:10.153
<v Speaker 1>hasn't been at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite all the efforts made by the u s </v>

105
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.390
<v Speaker 1>opium production remains at very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

106
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:23.610
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of having all of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

107
00:05:23.611 --> 00:05:24.780
<v Speaker 1>the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're managing,</v>

108
00:05:24.781 --> 00:05:28.140
<v Speaker 1>do you sustain a war that is not just </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing them to regain ground,</v>

109
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:29.033
<v Speaker 1>but there's also plunged the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>into violence and worst of all is that </v>

110
00:05:31.711 --> 00:05:33.450
<v Speaker 1>future predictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're not very good.</v>

111
00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:37.190
<v Speaker 3>The Taliban are getting stronger.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The government is on the retreat.</v>

112
00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.620
<v Speaker 3>They're losing ground to the Taliban day</v>
<v Speaker 3>by day.</v>

113
00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 3>Abdul Jabbar Carmen,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I retired general.</v>

114
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.243
<v Speaker 3>Listen to this.</v>

115
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:44.163
<v Speaker 1>Taliban army has increased from between </v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 to 10,000 soldiers in 2005 to more </v>

116
00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:50.980
<v Speaker 1>than 60,000 today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But at this point,</v>

117
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:54.370
<v Speaker 1>the question was to become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the u s losing this war?</v>

118
00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.430
<v Speaker 1>Or at least why aren't they winning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghan trap?</v>

119
00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:10.340
<v Speaker 1>The United States has tried many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different strategies in Afghanistan,</v>

120
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.100
<v Speaker 1>but it seems that nothing is working.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

121
00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:13.993
<v Speaker 1>generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this quite a lot of pessimism over this </v>

122
00:06:15.621 --> 00:06:16.454
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not just a matter of more or </v>

123
00:06:18.411 --> 00:06:19.244
<v Speaker 1>less soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Barack Obama was a candidate for </v>

124
00:06:21.231 --> 00:06:22.064
<v Speaker 1>president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he repeated all the time that </v>

125
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:26.720
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan was a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to win.</v>

126
00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:30.080
<v Speaker 1>We did not finish the job against al </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qaeda in Afghanistan.</v>

127
00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.033
<v Speaker 1>We did not develop new capabilities to </v>
<v Speaker 1>defeat a new enemy or launch a </v>

128
00:06:33.831 --> 00:06:36.830
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive strategy to dry up the </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist base of support.</v>

129
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.860
<v Speaker 1>We did not reaffirm our basic values or </v>
<v Speaker 1>secure our homeland.</v>

130
00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>It's time to turn the page.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When I am president,</v>

131
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.660
<v Speaker 1>we will wage war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has to be what Barack Obama,</v>

132
00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:45.583
<v Speaker 1>when he enrolled me into the White House</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he deployed 100,000 soldiers and </v>

133
00:06:48.501 --> 00:06:51.710
<v Speaker 1>another 40,000 from NATO.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even so nothing changed.</v>

134
00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Many experts say that.</v>

135
00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:53.533
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that President Obama </v>
<v Speaker 1>insisted all the time on an exit plan </v>

136
00:06:56.750 --> 00:06:58.180
<v Speaker 1>with a Pruett,</v>
<v Speaker 1>withdrawal,</v>

137
00:06:58.181 --> 00:06:59.014
<v Speaker 1>a calendar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is sort of like saying to the </v>

138
00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:00.950
<v Speaker 1>Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey look,</v>

139
00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.390
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry about any of this.</v>

140
00:07:02.391 --> 00:07:04.250
<v Speaker 1>It's all temporary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But beyond that,</v>

141
00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.280
<v Speaker 1>although the soldiers from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>international coalition gains grounds,</v>

142
00:07:07.310 --> 00:07:10.310
<v Speaker 1>they couldn't gain influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now the question is,</v>

143
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:11.510
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:07:11.511 --> 00:07:12.344
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a tribal country </v>

145
00:07:14.121 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>with a culture of consolidated violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not easy for international trips to</v>

146
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:19.184
<v Speaker 1>gain people's trust and be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>distinguish civilians from enemies or </v>

147
00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:24.440
<v Speaker 1>even just know what's happening on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>grounds.</v>

148
00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.333
<v Speaker 1>The cultural leave is absolutely huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and having suffered so many years of </v>

149
00:07:28.611 --> 00:07:30.460
<v Speaker 1>violence means that the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

150
00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>plenty of experience.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

151
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>there's the corruption and the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>credibility in the local governments.</v>

152
00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:36.733
<v Speaker 1>We can safely say that the Afghan </v>
<v Speaker 1>government has a total lack of </v>

153
00:07:39.021 --> 00:07:41.720
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which can provide anything to the Afghan</v>

154
00:07:41.721 --> 00:07:42.200
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

155
00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:44.450
<v Speaker 1>And while there are very few that do </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist,</v>

156
00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.640
<v Speaker 1>they are extremely corrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

157
00:07:46.700 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 1>this is one of the most corrupt </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries on earth.</v>

158
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>Ordinary Afghans don't like the Taliban,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they disliked the Afghan government.</v>

159
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:55.220
<v Speaker 1>Even more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People don't die for an army.</v>

160
00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:56.233
<v Speaker 1>They die for a country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And who wants to die for the current </v>

161
00:07:57.831 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>Afghan government?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dexter Filkins,</v>

162
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:00.823
<v Speaker 1>New Yorker reporter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>With all of this considered and also </v>

163
00:08:02.611 --> 00:08:03.444
<v Speaker 1>adding in the fear of the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to understand is why every </v>

164
00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:07.423
<v Speaker 1>month almost 4,000 soldiers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>policemen desert to the government of </v>

165
00:08:10.521 --> 00:08:11.271
<v Speaker 1>qubole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

166
00:08:11.271 --> 00:08:12.104
<v Speaker 1>we have to say that the strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s is taken with the Afghan </v>

167
00:08:14.271 --> 00:08:16.640
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the politics and the institutions.</v>

168
00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:17.773
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't worked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington hasn't even made the Afghan </v>

169
00:08:19.881 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>military able to function with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>exception of the special forces,</v>

170
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.850
<v Speaker 1>which is formed of 17,000 elite </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

171
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:28.790
<v Speaker 1>They are the only ones who are really </v>
<v Speaker 1>fighting the Taliban.</v>

172
00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:29.683
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama understood that the war in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan with something that the </v>

173
00:08:32.301 --> 00:08:33.134
<v Speaker 1>Afghan people should carry out though </v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s would be the one paying the </v>

174
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.710
<v Speaker 1>bills.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>

175
00:08:36.711 --> 00:08:37.544
<v Speaker 1>I signed a historic agreement between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States and Afghanistan that </v>

176
00:08:40.331 --> 00:08:43.700
<v Speaker 1>defines a new kind of relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>between our countries,</v>

177
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:45.093
<v Speaker 1>a future in which Afghans are </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for the security of their </v>

178
00:08:48.351 --> 00:08:49.184
<v Speaker 1>nation among all the problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We also have two eyes in one Pakistan </v>

179
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:56.190
<v Speaker 1>who was being accused of providing </v>
<v Speaker 1>support to the Taliban and to an economy</v>

180
00:08:56.220 --> 00:08:58.920
<v Speaker 1>which doesn't work at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And then there's three,</v>

181
00:08:59.090 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>a lot of concealed interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

182
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:02.214
<v Speaker 1>have you thought about what interests </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing to Ron or Moscow having this </v>

183
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:05.970
<v Speaker 1>war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing is clear,</v>

184
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.893
<v Speaker 1>it's countries don't want Afghanistan to</v>
<v Speaker 1>be an American colony because of all of </v>

185
00:09:10.021 --> 00:09:11.850
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After 16 years of war,</v>

186
00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>the battle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it continues,</v>

187
00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.930
<v Speaker 1>but now that the oval office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a new president,</v>

188
00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.033
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

189
00:09:23.510 --> 00:09:24.740
<v Speaker 3>a huge mistake.</v>

190
00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:31.380
<v Speaker 1>Trump has been saying for years that the</v>
<v Speaker 1>war in Afghanistan is a huge mistake and</v>

191
00:09:31.381 --> 00:09:32.214
<v Speaker 1>that the u s has to get out of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said it's of course three his </v>

192
00:09:34.891 --> 00:09:37.540
<v Speaker 1>favorite communication medium and that </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be twitter.</v>

193
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:38.423
<v Speaker 1>He repeated it to gain and the gain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2011 2012 2013 all the way until his </v>

194
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:46.180
<v Speaker 1>2016 cameras</v>

195
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.073
<v Speaker 3>pain.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When will we stop wasting our money on </v>

196
00:09:49.991 --> 00:09:52.990
<v Speaker 3>rebuilding Afghanistan?</v>
<v Speaker 3>We must rebuild our country first.</v>

197
00:09:54.370 --> 00:09:55.203
<v Speaker 3>It's time to get out of Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We're building roads in schools for </v>

198
00:09:57.371 --> 00:10:00.100
<v Speaker 3>people that hate us.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's not in our national interest.</v>

199
00:10:01.530 --> 00:10:05.560
<v Speaker 3>Do not allow our very stupid leaders to </v>
<v Speaker 3>sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan</v>

200
00:10:05.561 --> 00:10:09.520
<v Speaker 3>through 2024 with all costs by USA.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Make America Great.</v>

201
00:10:10.930 --> 00:10:14.230
<v Speaker 3>Now Obama is keeping our soldiers in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Afghanistan for at least another year.</v>

202
00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.240
<v Speaker 3>He is losing two wars simultaneously</v>

203
00:10:16.300 --> 00:10:17.133
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just twitter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump insisted again and again and </v>

204
00:10:18.881 --> 00:10:21.070
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Afghanistan was a mistake.</v>

205
00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:21.933
<v Speaker 1>Have a look at this.</v>

206
00:10:22.020 --> 00:10:25.560
<v Speaker 5>Afghanistan is a total and complete </v>
<v Speaker 5>disaster.</v>

207
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:29.130
<v Speaker 5>What are we doing?</v>
<v Speaker 5>Get out of Afghanistan.</v>

208
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 5>We've wasted billions and billions of </v>
<v Speaker 5>dollars and more importantly,</v>

209
00:10:33.601 --> 00:10:36.030
<v Speaker 5>thousands and thousands of lives</v>

210
00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:37.790
<v Speaker 1>brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course in the presidential campaign.</v>

211
00:10:37.791 --> 00:10:41.570
<v Speaker 1>He promised he will get the US out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan if elected.</v>

212
00:10:41.920 --> 00:10:43.520
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now that he's president as well,</v>

213
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:46.070
<v Speaker 1>things they seem to be rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference.</v>

214
00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:51.980
<v Speaker 3>Trump's new position.</v>

215
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:53.480
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

216
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:56.900
<v Speaker 1>On the 21st of August in the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>base of four to Meijer in Virginia,</v>

217
00:10:56.930 --> 00:11:00.080
<v Speaker 1>trump explained his brand new strategy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>

218
00:11:00.081 --> 00:11:04.040
<v Speaker 1>Let's just say that everything has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying for years when it came to nothing</v>

219
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.903
<v Speaker 1>trumps new strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so similar to a bombers that it's </v>

220
00:11:06.711 --> 00:11:08.720
<v Speaker 1>really quite difficult to differentiate </v>
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>

221
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Trump announced more troops but not that</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more.</v>

222
00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:15.830
<v Speaker 1>Basically the contingents will increase </v>
<v Speaker 1>from 12,000 to about 16,000 the training</v>

223
00:11:15.831 --> 00:11:16.664
<v Speaker 1>of the Afghan military and the fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>against terrorism will become a </v>

224
00:11:18.621 --> 00:11:20.540
<v Speaker 1>priority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More money will be spent.</v>

225
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.170
<v Speaker 1>Corruption will be battles and there </v>
<v Speaker 1>will be more pressure on Pakistan.</v>

226
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.480
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more of the same and nothing that the US</v>

227
00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.403
<v Speaker 1>hasn't done before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The main differences from Obama's </v>

228
00:11:29.451 --> 00:11:31.520
<v Speaker 1>strategy though are twofold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

229
00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:32.383
<v Speaker 1>there won't be a withdrawal calendar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm second from seems not to be </v>

230
00:11:35.121 --> 00:11:37.760
<v Speaker 1>interested in building Afghan </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>

231
00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:38.623
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the budget cuts on the State </v>

232
00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:42.380
<v Speaker 1>Department's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump seems to rely more on arms them on</v>

233
00:11:42.381 --> 00:11:43.214
<v Speaker 1>politics and it's not clear what trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to do with 16,000 soldiers that </v>

234
00:11:46.461 --> 00:11:47.294
<v Speaker 1>Obama couldn't do with 140 thousands how</v>
<v Speaker 1>he thinks he can stabilize the country </v>

235
00:11:50.811 --> 00:11:51.644
<v Speaker 1>without solid and reliable institutions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which could gain local people's trust </v>

236
00:11:54.791 --> 00:11:56.560
<v Speaker 1>and allow for some economic development.</v>

237
00:11:56.620 --> 00:11:58.660
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average age in Afghanistan is around</v>

238
00:11:58.661 --> 00:11:59.494
<v Speaker 1>18 years old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is an incredibly young population </v>

239
00:12:01.780 --> 00:12:02.613
<v Speaker 1>and this youth nowadays can't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have any future apart from </v>

240
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:06.424
<v Speaker 1>what the Taliban can offer them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If qubole or Washington or not able to </v>

241
00:12:09.011 --> 00:12:11.330
<v Speaker 1>build a framework of opportunities for </v>
<v Speaker 1>these people,</v>

242
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:14.140
<v Speaker 1>the end of violence will be very far </v>
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>

243
00:12:14.170 --> 00:12:17.380
<v Speaker 1>So the question must be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's Donald Trump aware of this.</v>

244
00:12:17.460 --> 00:12:22.460
<v Speaker 6>It's going to be only America first </v>
<v Speaker 6>America first,</v>

245
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:25.300
<v Speaker 6>sorry,</v>

246
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.133
<v Speaker 1>16 years with an $800 billion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of military and </v>

247
00:12:29.981 --> 00:12:32.350
<v Speaker 1>civilian losses later in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

248
00:12:32.351 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 1>It's still bogged down in what many call</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Afghan trap.</v>

249
00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.513
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that trump doesn't seem</v>
<v Speaker 1>to propose anything difference without </v>

250
00:12:39.221 --> 00:12:40.054
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And with Al's a multilateral </v>

251
00:12:41.531 --> 00:12:42.364
<v Speaker 1>willingness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which must include Afghanistan's </v>

252
00:12:43.781 --> 00:12:44.614
<v Speaker 1>neighbors like China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems very hard to believe that </v>

253
00:12:46.811 --> 00:12:49.720
<v Speaker 1>weapons are going to be enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now it's your turn.</v>

254
00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:52.150
<v Speaker 1>What do you think the US should do in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Afghanistan?</v>

255
00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.013
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can leave us your opinion in the </v>

<v Speaker 1>Friends at the reconsider media </v>

259
00:13:01.691 --> 00:13:04.240
<v Speaker 1>podcasts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they provided the vocals in this episode</v>

260
00:13:04.241 --> 00:13:06.160
<v Speaker 1>that we're not mine and is a ways</v>

261
00:13:06.490 --> 00:13:11.110
<v Speaker 6>thank you for watching.</v>
<v Speaker 6>My original instinct was to pull out,</v>

262
00:13:11.380 --> 00:13:15.670
<v Speaker 6>and historically,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I like following my instincts,</v>

263
00:13:15.910 --> 00:13:16.743
<v Speaker 6>but all my life,</v>
<v Speaker 6>I've heard that decisions are much </v>

264
00:13:19.751 --> 00:13:24.070
<v Speaker 6>different when you sit behind the desk </v>
<v Speaker 6>in the Oval Office.</v>

265
00:13:24.160 --> 00:13:24.993
<v Speaker 6>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 6>when you're president of the United </v>

266
00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:28.653
<v Speaker 6>States.</v>
