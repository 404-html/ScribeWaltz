1
00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.590
<v Speaker 1>Unless you're living in a cave and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>only source of news is visual politic,</v>

2
00:00:12.591 --> 00:00:13.424
<v Speaker 1>in which case thank you very much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably realize that Fidel Castro </v>

3
00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:18.740
<v Speaker 1>died,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends with his death.</v>

4
00:00:18.741 --> 00:00:19.574
<v Speaker 1>A communist icon disappears.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fidel Castro ruled over Cuba with an </v>

5
00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.180
<v Speaker 1>iron fist for over 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

6
00:00:26.181 --> 00:00:28.460
<v Speaker 1>many people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones where the Fidelis death will be the</v>

7
00:00:28.461 --> 00:00:29.294
<v Speaker 1>first step in a transition for Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a transition from a communist </v>

8
00:00:32.751 --> 00:00:37.751
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship to a liberal democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reality is is that Fidel Castro,</v>

9
00:00:38.731 --> 00:00:39.564
<v Speaker 1>he retired from politics in 2008,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handing over power to his brother Raul </v>

10
00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.683
<v Speaker 1>Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeping Cuba really in the family </v>

11
00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:46.724
<v Speaker 1>business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that Raul found himself </v>

12
00:00:48.321 --> 00:00:49.154
<v Speaker 1>having to apply several reforms in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reforms that it's not such a long time </v>

13
00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:53.624
<v Speaker 1>ago would have been impossible to </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine in a regime that touted itself </v>

14
00:00:56.481 --> 00:00:58.240
<v Speaker 1>as the perfect communist system.</v>

15
00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.150
<v Speaker 1>Castro ism is done,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least the way we know it.</v>

16
00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>No one really knows what will become of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

17
00:01:06.341 --> 00:01:10.120
<v Speaker 1>but one thing is the absolute certain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's changing.</v>

18
00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.013
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You will ask for a video about Cuba and </v>

19
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>you know that here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic.</v>

20
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:14.584
<v Speaker 1>We do like to think outside of the box,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in this video we're answering a very </v>

21
00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:20.500
<v Speaker 1>important question that we don't believe</v>
<v Speaker 1>has been answered yet.</v>

22
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:21.603
<v Speaker 1>Is now a good time to invest in Cuba?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it possible to make money out of the </v>

23
00:01:26.741 --> 00:01:29.950
<v Speaker 1>political changes that are expected on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the island today?</v>

24
00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.813
<v Speaker 1>We're going to answer that question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>History shows us that when an economy </v>

25
00:01:36.211 --> 00:01:38.970
<v Speaker 1>goes from a plan's one to a free market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>

26
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.500
<v Speaker 1>there is a window of time where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible to make a fortune.</v>

27
00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:45.870
<v Speaker 1>A good example of this is the Czech </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic,</v>

28
00:01:45.871 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 1>particularly the city of Prague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.200
<v Speaker 1>I'm making this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am British,</v>

30
00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:51.780
<v Speaker 1>but I live in Prague now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the beginning of the 19 nineties,</v>

31
00:01:51.781 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 1>the Czech Republic was opening up its </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy for the first time after decades</v>

32
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:56.634
<v Speaker 1>of communism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that for the first time in </v>

33
00:01:58.501 --> 00:02:03.501
<v Speaker 1>years you could buy and sell houses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

34
00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:09.050
<v Speaker 1>since the country was relatively poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the price of property,</v>

35
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:09.884
<v Speaker 1>it was very low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This attracted a lot of foreign </v>

36
00:02:11.961 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly from the north of Italy.</v>

37
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.360
<v Speaker 1>They were buying property for almost no </v>
<v Speaker 1>money at all.</v>

38
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.920
<v Speaker 1>Then years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Czech economy started growing fast.</v>

39
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.320
<v Speaker 1>Foreign companies came and settled down </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

40
00:02:24.321 --> 00:02:28.010
<v Speaker 1>Tourism grew and local people started </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in a short time,</v>

41
00:02:28.011 --> 00:02:31.100
<v Speaker 1>the price of houses doubled and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>people have invested early,</v>

42
00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:32.060
<v Speaker 1>became a millionaire.</v>

43
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.200
<v Speaker 2>Very</v>

44
00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:38.570
<v Speaker 1>similar thing might just happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

45
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.290
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a second because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't quite as simple as it sounds.</v>

46
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:43.183
<v Speaker 1>Other former communist countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ukraine didn't have the same amount </v>

47
00:02:45.411 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 1>of luck,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends more than one investor who invested</v>

48
00:02:48.081 --> 00:02:51.320
<v Speaker 1>in post-communist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine has gone bankrupt before.</v>

49
00:02:51.321 --> 00:02:52.154
<v Speaker 1>Considering investing in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to understand what's </v>

50
00:02:54.351 --> 00:02:55.184
<v Speaker 1>going on in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the nature of the reforms that </v>

51
00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.620
<v Speaker 1>are taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But before we get into all of that,</v>

52
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:00.483
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look.</v>

53
00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:04.700
<v Speaker 3>Tuition in Cuba today,</v>

54
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:05.603
<v Speaker 1>Cuba is a communist country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that their whole economy is </v>

55
00:03:08.611 --> 00:03:12.810
<v Speaker 1>directed by the government for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>clarity in the good times,</v>

56
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:16.290
<v Speaker 1>the Cuban government employees at 92 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of the country's people.</v>

57
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.590
<v Speaker 1>This means that almost everyone was </v>
<v Speaker 1>working in the public sector,</v>

58
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.710
<v Speaker 1>but those were the 19 eighties when Cuba</v>
<v Speaker 1>exported sugar,</v>

59
00:03:22.711 --> 00:03:26.760
<v Speaker 1>tobacco and all sorts of fruit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union was in 1989.</v>

60
00:03:26.761 --> 00:03:29.850
<v Speaker 1>The Berlin Wall came down and Fidel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Castro lost his trading</v>

61
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.883
<v Speaker 2>absolutely</v>

62
00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.803
<v Speaker 1>the US embargo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which forbids American companies from </v>

63
00:03:35.641 --> 00:03:36.474
<v Speaker 1>doing any kind of business with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>islands and Cuba was practically </v>

64
00:03:39.211 --> 00:03:40.044
<v Speaker 1>isolated from the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This resulted in a brutal economic </v>

65
00:03:43.051 --> 00:03:43.884
<v Speaker 1>crisis that lasted until the year 2000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was when Hugo Chavez came to power </v>

66
00:03:47.551 --> 00:03:48.384
<v Speaker 1>in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see in another one of our </v>

67
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:50.694
<v Speaker 1>videos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela used to be a very oil rich </v>

68
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.140
<v Speaker 1>country and since Chavez and Castro was </v>
<v Speaker 1>such good buddies,</v>

69
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Chavez gave a lot of money.</v>

70
00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:57.743
<v Speaker 2>Castle,</v>

71
00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.080
<v Speaker 1>this was the life raft that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting Castro's revolution.</v>

72
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.910
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2013,</v>

73
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.210
<v Speaker 1>oil prices collapsed and so did </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela's economy,</v>

74
00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.450
<v Speaker 1>and of course we have all that money </v>
<v Speaker 1>drying up and no longer went to Cuba.</v>

75
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.790
<v Speaker 1>Cuba's economy collapsed as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

76
00:04:13.791 --> 00:04:14.624
<v Speaker 1>at this time for Dell was already </v>
<v Speaker 1>retired and his brother Raul had taken </v>

77
00:04:17.061 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 1>the reins of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raul Castro realized that Cuba was,</v>

78
00:04:20.001 --> 00:04:20.834
<v Speaker 1>once again isolate it and he needed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change a lot of things or his country </v>

79
00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.660
<v Speaker 1>was going to get a whole lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wes gastros Chinese reform,</v>

80
00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just so I should say now,</v>

81
00:04:34.461 --> 00:04:36.470
<v Speaker 1>if you're enjoying the music in today's </v>
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>

82
00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>it's by a car and composable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rick Spelled Rak.</v>

83
00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.140
<v Speaker 1>He's from Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you like it,</v>

84
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>you will find links to his music in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description below this video.</v>

85
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:55.201
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

86
00:04:55.201 --> 00:04:56.034
<v Speaker 1>Back to 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Raul Castro and announcing a series </v>

87
00:04:58.831 --> 00:05:01.770
<v Speaker 1>of reforms in Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first reform was the legalization of</v>

88
00:05:01.771 --> 00:05:06.240
<v Speaker 1>something called the Quintet Easter's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what we would call a free zone,</v>

89
00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.840
<v Speaker 1>and this meant for the first time it </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cubans could start small businesses.</v>

90
00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.390
<v Speaker 1>There would still be a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>

91
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.283
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still couldn't hire anybody and </v>

92
00:05:14.611 --> 00:05:17.550
<v Speaker 1>they could only start a business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was one of the types allowed by the</v>

93
00:05:17.551 --> 00:05:18.450
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

94
00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 1>in the three years since these became </v>
<v Speaker 1>legal,</v>

95
00:05:20.371 --> 00:05:21.204
<v Speaker 1>these freelances of grains and </v>
<v Speaker 1>represents 10 percent of the Cuban </v>

96
00:05:23.581 --> 00:05:24.414
<v Speaker 1>workforce,</v>

97
00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.120
<v Speaker 3>it'd be tuition before people were </v>
<v Speaker 3>afraid of doing anything private because</v>

98
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.060
<v Speaker 3>government will take it away from that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but now the government trusts,</v>

99
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.970
<v Speaker 3>they went the protesters because they </v>
<v Speaker 3>are the future.</v>

100
00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.340
<v Speaker 1>Do hold on a moment because there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>more.</v>

101
00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:41.233
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raul Castro seems to be following the </v>

102
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.143
<v Speaker 1>Chinese Communist Party's playbook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way is going to be the </v>

103
00:05:46.431 --> 00:05:47.264
<v Speaker 1>topic of another video which we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be launching very soon actually in a </v>

104
00:05:49.611 --> 00:05:50.444
<v Speaker 1>very dung shopping style.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raul Castro has created his very own </v>

105
00:05:53.571 --> 00:05:54.404
<v Speaker 1>special economic zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the so called Marielle </v>

106
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>development zone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so well,</v>

107
00:05:59.121 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

108
00:06:00.321 --> 00:06:01.154
<v Speaker 1>in sight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this his own foreign companies are </v>

109
00:06:02.541 --> 00:06:03.374
<v Speaker 1>allowed to start businesses that were </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to hire local people and they </v>

110
00:06:06.101 --> 00:06:06.934
<v Speaker 1>were able to trade with less </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions that exist in the rest of </v>

111
00:06:09.291 --> 00:06:10.124
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

112
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.100
<v Speaker 1>Fife foreign companies to Cuban and I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>mixed.</v>

113
00:06:16.101 --> 00:06:20.360
<v Speaker 1>One are the first eight companies in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maria Development Zone,</v>

114
00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.720
<v Speaker 1>which is to become the main economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>goals and through Cuba.</v>

115
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:24.613
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering how is it </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that some international </v>

116
00:06:26.601 --> 00:06:27.434
<v Speaker 1>companies such as the Spanish hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>chain are able to operate in Cuba if </v>

117
00:06:31.341 --> 00:06:33.680
<v Speaker 1>apparently there's a ban on foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that,</v>

118
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.543
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're watching this video from </v>

119
00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.953
<v Speaker 1>somewhere outside of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you might well have traveled to </v>

120
00:06:38.181 --> 00:06:40.820
<v Speaker 1>volunteer at some points.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's the case while you were there,</v>

121
00:06:40.821 --> 00:06:44.030
<v Speaker 1>you were probably staying in a best </v>
<v Speaker 1>seller or Emilia hotel.</v>

122
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:44.893
<v Speaker 1>Both foreign companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so these Spanish companies have been </v>

123
00:06:46.941 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 1>operating in the country since the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>2000,</v>

124
00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.040
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is in order to establish </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves on the islands,</v>

125
00:06:55.090 --> 00:06:58.760
<v Speaker 1>both of these companies to partner with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cuban government.</v>

126
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:01.970
<v Speaker 1>This means that the hotels are owned by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the local governments,</v>

127
00:07:01.971 --> 00:07:05.930
<v Speaker 1>but the hotel chains have a licensed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate them and they get a share of the</v>

128
00:07:05.931 --> 00:07:06.650
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>

129
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:07.483
<v Speaker 1>So until now it was impossible to start </v>
<v Speaker 1>a company in Cuba unless you were in </v>

130
00:07:10.791 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 1>partnership with the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the creation of this special economic</v>

131
00:07:14.271 --> 00:07:18.650
<v Speaker 1>zone does show a clear trend or trends </v>
<v Speaker 1>that China's oil in the 19 nineties.</v>

132
00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:19.573
<v Speaker 1>Further to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a freeing up going on in the </v>

133
00:07:21.051 --> 00:07:21.884
<v Speaker 1>housing markets in just two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 40,000 new homes have been sold in </v>

134
00:07:25.281 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now this doesn't exactly mean the Cubans</v>

135
00:07:27.711 --> 00:07:31.090
<v Speaker 1>have private property and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions do you come with a thousand</v>

136
00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:31.933
<v Speaker 1>restrictions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does highlight that there is a </v>

137
00:07:33.591 --> 00:07:38.591
<v Speaker 1>trend going on in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

138
00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.673
<v Speaker 1>The most important change in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>times was Obama's announcement that the </v>

139
00:07:42.951 --> 00:07:46.430
<v Speaker 1>trade embargo between the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Cuba was coming to an end.</v>

140
00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 1>The problem is is that still needs to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>passed by the American Congress,</v>

141
00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:52.370
<v Speaker 1>ends with Donald trump being the next </v>
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>

142
00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>It's very difficult to predict exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen with that deal,</v>

143
00:07:55.570 --> 00:07:56.403
<v Speaker 4>but controlled by Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The Republican nominee for president </v>

144
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:03.900
<v Speaker 4>secretly conducted business in communist</v>
<v Speaker 4>Cuba during Fidel Castro's presidency.</v>

145
00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:07.990
<v Speaker 4>Despite strict American trade bands that</v>
<v Speaker 4>made such undertakings illegal,</v>

146
00:08:08.350 --> 00:08:10.750
<v Speaker 4>it's according to interviews with former</v>
<v Speaker 4>trump executives,</v>

147
00:08:11.110 --> 00:08:14.440
<v Speaker 4>internal company records and court </v>
<v Speaker 4>filings.</v>

148
00:08:15.060 --> 00:08:16.770
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

149
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:21.210
<v Speaker 1>If trump were to keep the embargo with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

150
00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.960
<v Speaker 1>that's going to be bad news for </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors who live in the United States.</v>

151
00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.843
<v Speaker 1>They would lose out to investors who </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from other countries which don't </v>

152
00:08:27.991 --> 00:08:29.670
<v Speaker 1>have such restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Britain,</v>

153
00:08:29.671 --> 00:08:30.900
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada free.</v>

154
00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:35.633
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a second because there's still </v>
<v Speaker 1>no guarantee that Cuba is going to </v>

155
00:08:37.651 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 1>become some sort of free market </v>
<v Speaker 1>paradise,</v>

156
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:40.494
<v Speaker 1>especially not overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not really clear that even if you </v>

157
00:08:42.601 --> 00:08:46.260
<v Speaker 1>were legally allowed to invest in Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's a good idea or not.</v>

158
00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.153
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two potential scenarios that </v>

159
00:08:48.661 --> 00:08:49.494
<v Speaker 1>could play out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

160
00:08:49.620 --> 00:08:52.530
<v Speaker 1>One option is that they followed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>model of track as the vacuum,</v>

161
00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:53.393
<v Speaker 1>which is now two countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Czech Republic and or it's possible </v>

162
00:08:56.560 --> 00:08:57.393
<v Speaker 1>they follow the example of the Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's have a look at these two very </v>

163
00:09:01.261 --> 00:09:06.261
<v Speaker 1>different examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia versus Ukraine.</v>

164
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:12.510
<v Speaker 1>In 1998 tracks of Lakia and the Ukraine </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandons the Communist system,</v>

165
00:09:12.660 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>but there is a really big difference </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

166
00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:16.163
<v Speaker 1>The checks had a revolution called the </v>
<v Speaker 1>velvet revolution to overthrow their </v>

167
00:09:19.141 --> 00:09:19.974
<v Speaker 1>dictator and the new government led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy on the screen now called fat </v>

168
00:09:22.831 --> 00:09:25.650
<v Speaker 1>Slob Harville.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He sends home the old guard who had been</v>

169
00:09:25.651 --> 00:09:27.840
<v Speaker 1>ruling the country meanwhile over in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>

170
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:30.720
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that then got that </v>
<v Speaker 1>political independence,</v>

171
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.000
<v Speaker 1>they kept the same old political elite.</v>

172
00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:36.283
<v Speaker 1>The president's Leonid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kraftwerk came from the old communist </v>

173
00:09:38.541 --> 00:09:40.640
<v Speaker 1>party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the end of our story.</v>

174
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.340
<v Speaker 1>Just like Ukraine and Czechoslovakia had</v>
<v Speaker 1>plans,</v>

175
00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:46.490
<v Speaker 1>economies where all of the companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>belonged to the government.</v>

176
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:47.383
<v Speaker 1>The first step in opening up these </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies to the wider world was </v>

177
00:09:49.971 --> 00:09:51.260
<v Speaker 1>privatization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bus,</v>

178
00:09:51.290 --> 00:09:52.123
<v Speaker 1>and this is really important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not all privatizations are created </v>

179
00:09:55.281 --> 00:09:56.114
<v Speaker 1>equally.</v>

180
00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.513
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

181
00:09:58.570 --> 00:09:59.403
<v Speaker 1>took all of their biggest companies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>made a calculation of the economic </v>

182
00:10:01.841 --> 00:10:02.674
<v Speaker 1>value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then they divided the economic value of </v>

183
00:10:04.571 --> 00:10:07.450
<v Speaker 1>these countries into bounce sheets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were a checks,</v>

184
00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:09.610
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could buy one of these vouchers</v>

185
00:10:09.611 --> 00:10:10.444
<v Speaker 1>for a reasonable price,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something equal to announce a weeks </v>

186
00:10:12.820 --> 00:10:13.653
<v Speaker 1>average salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why 80 percent of the eligible </v>

187
00:10:15.911 --> 00:10:19.390
<v Speaker 1>population bought a voucher with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>paper in your hands.</v>

188
00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.313
<v Speaker 1>You have the rights to buy some shares </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the company in order to help those </v>

189
00:10:23.531 --> 00:10:26.190
<v Speaker 1>who didn't know how to bid for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>shares for the Czech government.</v>

190
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:27.043
<v Speaker 1>Encouraged the creation of hedge funds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these hedge funds advised common </v>

191
00:10:30.371 --> 00:10:31.204
<v Speaker 1>citizens on how to invest intelligently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I check and was able to go to one of </v>

192
00:10:34.481 --> 00:10:38.530
<v Speaker 1>these hedge funds and say I wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get some shares in this company and that</v>

193
00:10:38.531 --> 00:10:39.350
<v Speaker 1>one exception</v>

194
00:10:39.350 --> 00:10:40.183
<v Speaker 2>right</v>

195
00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:42.623
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can probably imagine that was a </v>

196
00:10:44.131 --> 00:10:44.964
<v Speaker 1>lot of corruption here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also has a really positive </v>

197
00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:48.654
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It helps the majority of checks to </v>

198
00:10:50.221 --> 00:10:51.054
<v Speaker 1>benefits from the privatization of these</v>
<v Speaker 1>national companies and the proof really </v>

199
00:10:55.081 --> 00:10:55.914
<v Speaker 1>is in the pudding,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yet it's 25 years later and the Czech </v>

200
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.033
<v Speaker 1>Republic is as egalitarian as Germany </v>
<v Speaker 1>and has a quality of life as high as </v>

201
00:11:02.341 --> 00:11:02.930
<v Speaker 1>anywhere else.</v>

202
00:11:02.930 --> 00:11:03.763
<v Speaker 2>Urine</v>

203
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:12.620
<v Speaker 1>story in Ukraine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's a different matter.</v>

204
00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:13.603
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ukraine did also sell these </v>

205
00:11:14.481 --> 00:11:15.830
<v Speaker 1>vouchers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do that citizens.</v>

206
00:11:15.890 --> 00:11:16.723
<v Speaker 1>If you were re Ukrainian citizen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could bid for a voucher and </v>

207
00:11:19.191 --> 00:11:22.280
<v Speaker 1>eventually you were able to use this </v>
<v Speaker 1>voucher to buy some shares,</v>

208
00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:23.263
<v Speaker 1>but the reality of the matter is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government never got around to </v>

209
00:11:25.281 --> 00:11:28.040
<v Speaker 1>arranging those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Auctions is only really happens with the</v>

210
00:11:28.041 --> 00:11:28.874
<v Speaker 1>smallest and worst of Ukraine's </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and the Ukrainians we'll have </v>

211
00:11:31.601 --> 00:11:34.790
<v Speaker 1>to waiting for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They had their vouchers in hands,</v>

212
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:35.823
<v Speaker 1>but they weren't able to do anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>useful with them and unfortunately </v>

213
00:11:38.081 --> 00:11:38.914
<v Speaker 1>during this same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine was also suffering from record </v>

214
00:11:41.171 --> 00:11:43.600
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When purchased these vouchers would cost</v>

215
00:11:43.601 --> 00:11:44.434
<v Speaker 1>1,500 American dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some years later they were being </v>

216
00:11:47.441 --> 00:11:50.830
<v Speaker 1>exchanged on the black market for as </v>
<v Speaker 1>little as 10 US dollars.</v>

217
00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:57.430
<v Speaker 1>The average would be sitting at home and</v>
<v Speaker 1>an oligarch would come knocking and he'd</v>

218
00:11:57.431 --> 00:11:59.110
<v Speaker 1>say something like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Whoa,</v>

219
00:11:59.111 --> 00:12:00.640
<v Speaker 1>what are you going to do with that </v>
<v Speaker 1>voucher?</v>

220
00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:02.710
<v Speaker 1>It's never going to be worth anything to</v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

221
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:03.843
<v Speaker 1>tell you what you give it to me and I'll</v>
<v Speaker 1>give you some money that you can </v>

222
00:12:06.611 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 1>actually use and surprise surprise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon enough,</v>

223
00:12:09.671 --> 00:12:10.504
<v Speaker 1>all of the vouchers were in the hands of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the oligarchs and there's no prizes for </v>

224
00:12:14.261 --> 00:12:15.610
<v Speaker 1>guessing here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but yes,</v>

225
00:12:15.611 --> 00:12:18.760
<v Speaker 1>the oligarchs did have some pretty close</v>
<v Speaker 1>connections to the government.</v>

226
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:21.490
<v Speaker 1>Then decided to auction off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of those companies</v>

227
00:12:25.630 --> 00:12:26.463
<v Speaker 1>come.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only those companies that were </v>

228
00:12:27.371 --> 00:12:28.204
<v Speaker 1>interesting to the oligarchs were sold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that is why Ukraine still has to go </v>

229
00:12:31.961 --> 00:12:32.794
<v Speaker 1>through some privatizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most important thing to bear in </v>

230
00:12:35.561 --> 00:12:37.810
<v Speaker 1>mind here is that in present day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine,</v>

231
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:38.943
<v Speaker 1>85 percent of the country's wealth is in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hands of the 50 wealthiest </v>

232
00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:46.150
<v Speaker 1>oligarchs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The result is no political stability and</v>

233
00:12:46.151 --> 00:12:48.800
<v Speaker 1>they horrific environment for investing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

234
00:12:48.801 --> 00:12:51.670
<v Speaker 1>and that's not to mention the whole war </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Russia thing.</v>

235
00:12:51.880 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 1>So if an investor had bought a property </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Kiev 10 years ago,</v>

236
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.660
<v Speaker 1>they might just be banging their head </v>
<v Speaker 1>against the wall right about now.</v>

237
00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's go back to Cuba.</v>

238
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.693
<v Speaker 1>Here we have some things that resemble </v>
<v Speaker 1>Czechoslovakia and we have some things </v>

239
00:13:06.461 --> 00:13:08.440
<v Speaker 1>that resemble Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

240
00:13:08.441 --> 00:13:11.020
<v Speaker 1>in the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have 2 million Cubans living.</v>

241
00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:14.740
<v Speaker 1>This represents 20 percent of the entire</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuban population.</v>

242
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:18.130
<v Speaker 1>These Cuban Americans have been educated</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a democratic system,</v>

243
00:13:18.190 --> 00:13:20.980
<v Speaker 1>and this could help build good </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic institutions.</v>

244
00:13:21.250 --> 00:13:22.083
<v Speaker 2>Cuba</v>

245
00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:27.020
<v Speaker 1>does show itself to be the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then Cuba could become a place with rule</v>

246
00:13:27.021 --> 00:13:28.280
<v Speaker 1>of law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>civil rights,</v>

247
00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:32.000
<v Speaker 1>and many opportunities for Cubans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lift themselves out of poverty.</v>

248
00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.760
<v Speaker 1>So now that we've given you the rundown </v>
<v Speaker 1>on Cuba and shared our opinion,</v>

249
00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:38.623
<v Speaker 1>we would love to know yours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think's going to happen in </v>

250
00:13:41.211 --> 00:13:42.044
<v Speaker 1>Cuba?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they'll follow the path of </v>

251
00:13:42.831 --> 00:13:44.810
<v Speaker 1>the Czech Republic or the path of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ukraine?</v>
