1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>It's an image that will go down in </v>
<v Speaker 1>history for the first time since plating</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:06.180
<v Speaker 1>ends and in 1953 and North Korean leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

3
00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:07.014
<v Speaker 1>the ruthless dictator can Jong Uhmm </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacet ports in South Korea to declare </v>

4
00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:13.830
<v Speaker 1>his supposed intentions for peace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>denuclearization.</v>

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.140
<v Speaker 1>Now the questions are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is this really a moments of peace?</v>

6
00:00:16.141 --> 00:00:16.974
<v Speaker 1>What can we expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does everything seem to suddenly be </v>

7
00:00:19.261 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 1>going so smoothly?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

8
00:00:20.551 --> 00:00:24.060
<v Speaker 1>is North Korea really willing to give up</v>
<v Speaker 1>that nuclear bomb?</v>

9
00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a view of these are some of the </v>

10
00:00:25.201 --> 00:00:28.380
<v Speaker 1>questions that I'm sure you are all </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:29.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we look at it.</v>

12
00:00:29.971 --> 00:00:30.804
<v Speaker 1>Shall We?</v>

13
00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.160
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

14
00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.490
<v Speaker 1>Humming while walking and even holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>hands toasting and dining together.</v>

15
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.353
<v Speaker 1>This is how we were able to witness the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north and South Korean leaders last </v>

16
00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 1>Friday on April the 27th 2018 we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about the latest into Korea.</v>

17
00:00:59.071 --> 00:00:59.904
<v Speaker 1>Summit's in which both countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to seeking a definitive peace </v>

18
00:01:02.431 --> 00:01:03.390
<v Speaker 1>agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Technically,</v>

19
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:04.224
<v Speaker 1>both careers are still at Wachter </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuild their relations and pursue the </v>

20
00:01:06.931 --> 00:01:09.270
<v Speaker 1>denuclearization of the Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peninsula.</v>

21
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:10.153
<v Speaker 1>There's something took place in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>demilitarized zone in the town of Pam </v>

22
00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.190
<v Speaker 1>and John in the exact place where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean War armistice was signed.</v>

23
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.970
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

24
00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:25.480
<v Speaker 1>Both the North Korean leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong and South Korean president moon</v>

25
00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:26.343
<v Speaker 1>giant displays a level of complicity </v>
<v Speaker 1>that would have been very hard to </v>

26
00:01:29.231 --> 00:01:34.231
<v Speaker 1>imagine only a few months ago pictures </v>
<v Speaker 1>from that day.</v>

27
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.190
<v Speaker 1>They are going to go down in history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm really not exaggerating here.</v>

28
00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:41.083
<v Speaker 1>The scenes that we saw of walks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>handshakes and whispers between the two </v>

29
00:01:43.851 --> 00:01:44.684
<v Speaker 1>leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what ends have been out of place in a </v>

30
00:01:45.861 --> 00:01:46.730
<v Speaker 1>romance movie.</v>

31
00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.240
<v Speaker 3>Do you remember the honeymoon?</v>
<v Speaker 3>I promise you we're going to have it.</v>

32
00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:07.773
<v Speaker 1>And you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a way that was precisely what was </v>

33
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:12.280
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a political courtship between two</v>

34
00:02:12.281 --> 00:02:14.740
<v Speaker 1>leaders who really couldn't be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

35
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.780
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand you have the South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean president,</v>

36
00:02:20.781 --> 00:02:21.614
<v Speaker 1>Moon Jan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lawyer who specialized in human </v>

37
00:02:23.181 --> 00:02:25.070
<v Speaker 1>rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a man of humble origins,</v>

38
00:02:25.071 --> 00:02:25.904
<v Speaker 1>whose parents managed to flee from North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea and she was an activist for </v>

39
00:02:28.101 --> 00:02:29.450
<v Speaker 1>democracy during his youth.</v>

40
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

41
00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:31.793
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hands we have Kim John </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of the worst tyrants on the </v>

42
00:02:34.141 --> 00:02:34.974
<v Speaker 1>planet's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the omnipresent leader of one of </v>

43
00:02:36.001 --> 00:02:38.780
<v Speaker 1>the most terrible countries that anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>could possibly imagine</v>

44
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.770
<v Speaker 2>because</v>

45
00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:43.930
<v Speaker 1>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the summit's images in which Kim</v>

46
00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.070
<v Speaker 1>Jong Un almost looked like a cab app,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not forget who we really is.</v>

47
00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.090
<v Speaker 1>Let's not forget that the North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader heads a regime of terror in which</v>

48
00:02:51.091 --> 00:02:54.630
<v Speaker 1>human rights violations are part of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state's routine function.</v>

49
00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.360
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost</v>

50
00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.400
<v Speaker 1>forgotten the allegations that he had </v>
<v Speaker 1>his half brother with a chemical weapon</v>

51
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.600
<v Speaker 4>just last year and then he had his uncle</v>
<v Speaker 4>ripped apart with anti aircraft guns.</v>

52
00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.600
<v Speaker 4>Gary Samore,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Obama's White House coordinator for arms</v>

53
00:03:07.601 --> 00:03:09.220
<v Speaker 4>control and weapons of mass destruction.</v>

54
00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:10.243
<v Speaker 1>In spite of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and thanks to the images we saw as the </v>

55
00:03:12.291 --> 00:03:13.124
<v Speaker 1>declaration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both governments agreed on most of the </v>

56
00:03:14.691 --> 00:03:17.420
<v Speaker 1>press described this meeting as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>historic day,</v>

57
00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.870
<v Speaker 1>the day when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once and for all peace tribe.</v>

58
00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.450
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now the question really has to be,</v>

59
00:03:31.451 --> 00:03:32.980
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how true is all of this?</v>

60
00:03:32.981 --> 00:03:35.670
<v Speaker 1>Are things really going that well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

61
00:03:35.671 --> 00:03:36.504
<v Speaker 1>are we facing east sincere exercise in </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomacy or simply a big marketing </v>

62
00:03:40.121 --> 00:03:42.940
<v Speaker 1>scam?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Pyongyang roadmap actually changed?</v>

63
00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:46.890
<v Speaker 4>Dialogue is certainly better than a </v>
<v Speaker 4>march to war.</v>

64
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.813
<v Speaker 4>That said,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we all need to keep our expectations in </v>

65
00:03:49.801 --> 00:03:51.270
<v Speaker 4>check.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When Dr.</v>

66
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.760
<v Speaker 4>Sherman,</v>
<v Speaker 4>US Undersecretary of State for Political</v>

67
00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:54.594
<v Speaker 4>Affairs from 2011 to 2015 and in North </v>
<v Speaker 4>Korea policy coordinator in the Clinton </v>

68
00:03:58.081 --> 00:03:58.914
<v Speaker 4>administration,</v>

69
00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.763
<v Speaker 1>we'll explore this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first here's a question that I'm </v>

70
00:04:01.391 --> 00:04:02.224
<v Speaker 1>sure many of us have asked.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How the hell did we go in just a few </v>

71
00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:06.970
<v Speaker 1>months from hearing the drums of war?</v>

72
00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.560
<v Speaker 5>Have you got time</v>

73
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:24.790
<v Speaker 1>assumption?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well cordio and harmonious meeting.</v>

74
00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:31.123
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

75
00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.680
<v Speaker 1>well we can come up with three different</v>
<v Speaker 1>explanations.</v>

76
00:04:37.681 --> 00:04:41.250
<v Speaker 1>That's still compliments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The North Korean regime is new behavior,</v>

77
00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:42.113
<v Speaker 1>which in a very short time it wins from </v>
<v Speaker 1>it threatening the United States to </v>

78
00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:47.700
<v Speaker 1>suspending its nuclear and missile </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests.</v>

79
00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 4>Korea threatened to turn us into see a </v>
<v Speaker 4>flames.</v>

80
00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:55.880
<v Speaker 4>North Korea says it will suspend nuclear</v>
<v Speaker 4>and missile tests.</v>

81
00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:59.020
<v Speaker 1>So let's take a look at the possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons for this change.</v>

82
00:04:59.021 --> 00:05:02.560
<v Speaker 1>And let me tell you things are not as </v>
<v Speaker 1>simple as they seem.</v>

83
00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:08.670
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

84
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.440
<v Speaker 4>Pyongyang.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We have a problem.</v>

85
00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:12.700
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

86
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.533
<v Speaker 1>The first possible explanation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to several analysts from the </v>

87
00:05:15.791 --> 00:05:19.180
<v Speaker 1>United States and South Korea in two </v>
<v Speaker 1>studies by Chinese researchers,</v>

88
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.043
<v Speaker 1>the Pong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every nuclear tests sensor located in </v>

89
00:05:21.551 --> 00:05:22.384
<v Speaker 1>the heart of a 2,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>meter high mountains in known as </v>

90
00:05:24.131 --> 00:05:24.964
<v Speaker 1>mountains man's hap could have collapsed</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the last atomic test in which the </v>

91
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:28.603
<v Speaker 1>thermonuclear bomb of 250 kilos tons </v>
<v Speaker 1>with designated by North Korea and this </v>

92
00:05:32.231 --> 00:05:34.770
<v Speaker 1>area on September the third 2017</v>

93
00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.453
<v Speaker 5>yeah,</v>

94
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:45.070
<v Speaker 1>explosion was so strong that it calls </v>
<v Speaker 1>the 6.3</v>

95
00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:46.570
<v Speaker 1>magnitude earthquake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:05:46.571 --> 00:05:47.404
<v Speaker 1>the collapse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems to have been confirmed and it </v>

97
00:05:48.461 --> 00:05:52.460
<v Speaker 1>isn't clear whether the center is </v>
<v Speaker 1>operational a lot based</v>

98
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:53.293
<v Speaker 4>on the severity of the initial blast,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the post test tremors and the extent of </v>

99
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:58.364
<v Speaker 4>observable surface disturbances,</v>
<v Speaker 4>we have to assume that there must have </v>

100
00:06:01.371 --> 00:06:05.470
<v Speaker 4>been substantial damage to the existing </v>
<v Speaker 4>tunnel network under mount man tap,</v>

101
00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 4>Frank v,</v>
<v Speaker 4>pay Bian and Jack Lew.</v>

102
00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.480
<v Speaker 1>If it isn't operational or if it's too </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly damaged,</v>

103
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:11.343
<v Speaker 1>it could take some time for the regime </v>
<v Speaker 1>to rebuild it enough to be able to hold </v>

104
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:17.080
<v Speaker 1>new tests in a safe manner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could have definitely been a factor</v>

105
00:06:17.081 --> 00:06:19.480
<v Speaker 1>that could have altered the deadlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't seem like this could have</v>

106
00:06:19.481 --> 00:06:21.310
<v Speaker 1>been the main cause for the change of </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse</v>

107
00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.750
<v Speaker 4>economy's stupid.</v>

108
00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:33.473
<v Speaker 1>Another hypothesis has to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>effects of international sanctions on </v>

109
00:06:36.001 --> 00:06:37.830
<v Speaker 1>the North Korean economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you all know,</v>

110
00:06:37.831 --> 00:06:40.530
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor country.</v>

111
00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:41.400
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>

112
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:45.030
<v Speaker 1>a large part of the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>community has imposed sanctions on North</v>

113
00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.860
<v Speaker 1>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these have generally not effective.</v>

114
00:06:46.861 --> 00:06:48.840
<v Speaker 1>The country's main partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

115
00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Vietnam.</v>

116
00:06:51.930 --> 00:06:52.763
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this began to change with the </v>

117
00:06:53.881 --> 00:06:54.714
<v Speaker 1>sanctions that the United Nations began </v>
<v Speaker 1>imposing on North Korea in 2017 in </v>

118
00:06:58.201 --> 00:07:01.050
<v Speaker 1>response to its continued nuclear tests </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time,</v>

119
00:07:01.051 --> 00:07:01.884
<v Speaker 1>these sanctions were greatly fulfilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>by China and that was a very hard blow </v>

120
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:06.923
<v Speaker 1>to North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The vast majority of North Korean trade </v>

121
00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.880
<v Speaker 1>happens with China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If that's cut well,</v>

122
00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.310
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang has a very serious</v>

123
00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:15.183
<v Speaker 2>problem</v>

124
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:20.460
<v Speaker 1>multiplied when in September after the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last them a nuclear test,</v>

125
00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:22.470
<v Speaker 1>the United Nations Security Council </v>
<v Speaker 1>bands,</v>

126
00:07:22.530 --> 00:07:25.320
<v Speaker 1>all of North Korea's key exports </v>
<v Speaker 1>including coal,</v>

127
00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:26.910
<v Speaker 1>iron and textiles.</v>

128
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:27.843
<v Speaker 4>This resolution is the single largest </v>
<v Speaker 4>economic sanctions package ever leveled </v>

129
00:07:32.710 --> 00:07:33.543
<v Speaker 4>against the North Korean regime.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The price the North Korean leadership </v>

130
00:07:36.521 --> 00:07:37.354
<v Speaker 4>will pay for its continued nuclear and </v>
<v Speaker 4>missile development will be the loss of </v>

131
00:07:40.631 --> 00:07:43.990
<v Speaker 4>one third of its exports and hard </v>
<v Speaker 4>currency.</v>

132
00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.923
<v Speaker 1>An old lady that was in December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same body agreed to limit their </v>

133
00:07:47.101 --> 00:07:50.040
<v Speaker 1>refined oil imports do half a million </v>
<v Speaker 1>barrels per year,</v>

134
00:07:50.070 --> 00:07:54.900
<v Speaker 1>a 90% reduction compared to the amount </v>
<v Speaker 1>of refined oil North Korea had purchased</v>

135
00:07:54.901 --> 00:07:57.240
<v Speaker 1>over the previous year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what was the result of all of this?</v>

136
00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:58.103
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several factories had to close due to a </v>

137
00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:00.474
<v Speaker 1>lack of raw materials and the army due </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a lack of gasoline had to resort to </v>

138
00:08:03.511 --> 00:08:05.600
<v Speaker 1>coal engines.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And even oxcarts.</v>

139
00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:07.873
<v Speaker 1>And although it may surprise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this situation doesn't only accentuate </v>

140
00:08:11.311 --> 00:08:12.144
<v Speaker 1>North Korea's weaknesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also is a hard blow to Kim Jong </v>

141
00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.923
<v Speaker 1>Un's governments making economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>development's a big priority as of </v>

142
00:08:18.661 --> 00:08:19.494
<v Speaker 1>course these sanctions are also </v>
<v Speaker 1>affecting the level of life the elite </v>

143
00:08:21.931 --> 00:08:23.970
<v Speaker 1>sends the incipient middle class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Enjoy.</v>

144
00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a moment.</v>

145
00:08:26.841 --> 00:08:28.980
<v Speaker 1>So an emerging middle class in North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

146
00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.300
<v Speaker 1>Well yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you had it right.</v>

147
00:08:30.301 --> 00:08:31.620
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>here's a question for you.</v>

148
00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:32.483
<v Speaker 1>Do you think they've,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a capitalist market can be developing </v>

149
00:08:34.111 --> 00:08:36.000
<v Speaker 1>within present day North Korea?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

150
00:08:36.030 --> 00:08:39.210
<v Speaker 1>stay tuned for an upcoming video that we</v>
<v Speaker 1>have on that.</v>

151
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Even though all of this is important and</v>
<v Speaker 1>to certainly influenced the situation,</v>

152
00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:46.740
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't sound like something that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could put the regime at risk,</v>

153
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:49.610
<v Speaker 1>at least not for the moment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

154
00:08:49.610 --> 00:08:50.443
<v Speaker 4>think the North Koreans would revolt </v>
<v Speaker 4>where the regime would collapse because </v>

155
00:08:53.451 --> 00:08:54.920
<v Speaker 4>of sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>You don't know anything.</v>

156
00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 4>The North Koreans user,</v>
<v Speaker 4>people who survived the famine by eating</v>

157
00:08:58.830 --> 00:08:59.663
<v Speaker 4>wheat came mission.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A North Korean defector who works for </v>

158
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.350
<v Speaker 4>South Korea's Essential Bank of Korea.</v>

159
00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:08.110
<v Speaker 1>So then why is Pyongyang changed its </v>
<v Speaker 1>discourse so much?</v>

160
00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:11.080
<v Speaker 1>Barb has it really just actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

161
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.230
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is a nuclear power that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply a fax.</v>

162
00:09:29.231 --> 00:09:30.064
<v Speaker 1>If according to American intelligence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country currently could have </v>

163
00:09:32.211 --> 00:09:35.590
<v Speaker 1>between 20 and 60 warheads ready for use</v>
<v Speaker 1>stan.</v>

164
00:09:35.610 --> 00:09:38.600
<v Speaker 1>Otherwise Pyongyang has already achieved</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's great goal.</v>

165
00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.453
<v Speaker 1>It has its insurance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has the best deterrent that has ever </v>

166
00:09:42.651 --> 00:09:47.651
<v Speaker 1>been built.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

167
00:09:49.521 --> 00:09:52.100
<v Speaker 1>it is true that in the last April 27th </v>
<v Speaker 1>into Korea,</v>

168
00:09:52.101 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 1>some is North Korea promise to </v>
<v Speaker 1>denuclearize the peninsula,</v>

169
00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:58.610
<v Speaker 1>but Paul's on a moment because that </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't mean it's willing to give up its</v>

170
00:09:58.611 --> 00:09:59.444
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons first because North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea has already promised many things </v>

171
00:10:02.391 --> 00:10:03.920
<v Speaker 1>that they did and do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

172
00:10:03.921 --> 00:10:07.400
<v Speaker 1>the negotiations and agreements of 1991 </v>
<v Speaker 1>1990 40,000</v>

173
00:10:07.401 --> 00:10:12.401
<v Speaker 1>2007 2012 north grand promises not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly something new and so far they've</v>

174
00:10:13.070 --> 00:10:18.070
<v Speaker 1>always been rather flimsy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

175
00:10:20.021 --> 00:10:20.854
<v Speaker 1>in 1994 Kim Jong UN's father Kim Jong Il</v>
<v Speaker 1>even went so far as to started </v>

176
00:10:24.350 --> 00:10:25.183
<v Speaker 1>dismantling the nuclear program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing international inspectors to </v>

177
00:10:27.691 --> 00:10:28.524
<v Speaker 1>visit the country to verify the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was all in exchange for some </v>

178
00:10:31.291 --> 00:10:33.480
<v Speaker 1>generous health in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

179
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:36.420
<v Speaker 1>years later the world found out that it </v>
<v Speaker 1>had been a scam.</v>

180
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:39.210
<v Speaker 1>The program had continued to developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>clandestinely.</v>

181
00:10:39.211 --> 00:10:40.044
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

182
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:43.123
<v Speaker 1>In 2000 South Korean President Kim Die </v>
<v Speaker 1>Junge announced that a new day would </v>

183
00:10:46.371 --> 00:10:47.204
<v Speaker 1>come after returning from his visit with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2007 South </v>

184
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:56.090
<v Speaker 1>Korean President Romeo Horn stated </v>
<v Speaker 1>during his visit to North Korea,</v>

185
00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.220
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong Il has shown a will to restore </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

186
00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:04.253
<v Speaker 1>And the second reason we can't assume </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea will give up its nuclear </v>

187
00:11:06.361 --> 00:11:07.194
<v Speaker 1>weapons is that we may not be on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same page about what constitutes </v>

188
00:11:09.361 --> 00:11:12.390
<v Speaker 1>denuclearization allow me to explain for</v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond Yang.</v>

189
00:11:12.391 --> 00:11:14.910
<v Speaker 1>This time has got a lot to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only with its nuclear weapons,</v>

190
00:11:14.911 --> 00:11:18.450
<v Speaker 1>but also with the u s military is </v>
<v Speaker 1>capabilities in the peninsula and in the</v>

191
00:11:18.451 --> 00:11:19.680
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in any case,</v>

192
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:20.573
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that it seems very </v>
<v Speaker 1>difficult for Kim Jong Un to be willing </v>

193
00:11:22.801 --> 00:11:24.840
<v Speaker 1>to part with his best life insurance.</v>

194
00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:29.230
<v Speaker 4>We must remember,</v>
<v Speaker 4>North Korea is still North Korea.</v>

195
00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.800
<v Speaker 4>Kim is still at the same person he was </v>
<v Speaker 4>when he purged potential rivals,</v>

196
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.860
<v Speaker 4>imprisoned thousands of his people and </v>
<v Speaker 4>had his relatives killed.</v>

197
00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:39.250
<v Speaker 4>This was a hopeful moment,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but extreme caution as well.</v>

198
00:11:39.251 --> 00:11:40.084
<v Speaker 4>Warranted Abraham Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 4>director of the Asian program at the </v>

199
00:11:42.611 --> 00:11:43.444
<v Speaker 4>Woodrow Wilson Center and former US </v>
<v Speaker 4>assistant secretary of defense for East </v>

200
00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:47.220
<v Speaker 4>Asia.</v>

201
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:49.400
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is something that intercepted North</v>

202
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:50.233
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Communications have definitely shown </v>

203
00:11:51.750 --> 00:11:55.210
<v Speaker 1>everything seems to be part of some kind</v>
<v Speaker 1>of roadmap.</v>

204
00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:57.250
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ensure the survival of the regime,</v>

205
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:58.084
<v Speaker 1>something he has achieved with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear arsenal and seconds negotiate </v>

206
00:12:01.181 --> 00:12:05.060
<v Speaker 1>with the international community to ends</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sanctions to launch a reform program</v>

207
00:12:05.110 --> 00:12:07.630
<v Speaker 1>that can attract investment from China </v>
<v Speaker 1>and South Korea.</v>

208
00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:08.603
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

209
00:12:12.210 --> 00:12:13.043
<v Speaker 1>that means although far from how things </v>
<v Speaker 1>might seem at first to Pyongyang could </v>

210
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.280
<v Speaker 1>simply be following our well outlines </v>
<v Speaker 1>plan was the insecurity or some summit,</v>

211
00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:21.203
<v Speaker 1>a big marketing exercise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then this in a way explains why South </v>

212
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:24.953
<v Speaker 1>Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so skeptical of the North's </v>

213
00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:28.050
<v Speaker 1>promises.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean just check out this survey,</v>

214
00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.153
<v Speaker 1>but now well it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think North Korea will actually </v>

215
00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.124
<v Speaker 1>give up its nuclear program?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leave your comments below and also in </v>
