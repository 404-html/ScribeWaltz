1
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay's the country famous for soccer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we celebrate Russia's,</v>

2
00:00:10.931 --> 00:00:11.764
<v Speaker 1>we'll see this summer we've checked the </v>
<v Speaker 1>whole fame and there are only eight </v>

3
00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:17.030
<v Speaker 1>countries that have ever want to final </v>
<v Speaker 1>year grier,</v>

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.983
<v Speaker 1>really small country with a little more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 3 million inhabitants while there </v>

5
00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:21.763
<v Speaker 1>one of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've even won the cup twice and in </v>

6
00:00:23.211 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>both cases they beat their need as </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil and Argentina.</v>

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.493
<v Speaker 2>Tina.</v>

8
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.523
<v Speaker 1>So in today's video we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about how Uruguayan has beaten then </v>

9
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.700
<v Speaker 1>neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not in soccer,</v>

10
00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.310
<v Speaker 1>but rather in economics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

11
00:00:38.311 --> 00:00:39.144
<v Speaker 1>alongside Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay is the wealthiest country in </v>

12
00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:42.144
<v Speaker 1>America when it comes to GDP per capita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also one of the most stable </v>

13
00:00:45.661 --> 00:00:48.720
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to politics and that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the best public services,</v>

14
00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.673
<v Speaker 1>but there's even more to this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can actually say that Uruguay is the </v>

15
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:55.270
<v Speaker 1>model for the entire South American left</v>
<v Speaker 1>wing.</v>

16
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.270
<v Speaker 1>Have you ever heard about their former </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents seem weaker?</v>

17
00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.243
<v Speaker 1>He's known as the world's poorest </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents and he quickly became the </v>

18
00:01:01.291 --> 00:01:04.080
<v Speaker 1>ultimate leftwing or rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's the only world leader.</v>

19
00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:05.063
<v Speaker 1>We refuse to live in the presidential </v>
<v Speaker 1>palace and kept driving an old </v>

20
00:01:07.561 --> 00:01:10.650
<v Speaker 1>Volkswagen instead of an expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>official car.</v>

21
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:14.423
<v Speaker 1>From a life philosophy perspective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I believe it's better to live little </v>

22
00:01:17.581 --> 00:01:20.100
<v Speaker 1>luggage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just the minimum necessary,</v>

23
00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.760
<v Speaker 1>no material complexity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have too much complexity,</v>

24
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.430
<v Speaker 1>you end up spending too much time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

25
00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>while knew who kind of has this simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>lifestyle,</v>

26
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:29.364
<v Speaker 1>his country grew economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's attracted foreign companies and it </v>

27
00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:32.334
<v Speaker 1>became a pioneer with social rights with</v>
<v Speaker 1>me here as President Uruguay passed a </v>

28
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:38.310
<v Speaker 1>bill for the legalization of same sex </v>
<v Speaker 1>marriage.</v>

29
00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.173
<v Speaker 1>That's undoubtedly his most famous </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy was the legalization of </v>

30
00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 1>recreational marijuana sales way before </v>
<v Speaker 1>California or any other country.</v>

31
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayan was the first country to </v>
<v Speaker 1>legalize the sale and consumption of </v>

32
00:01:51.271 --> 00:01:54.060
<v Speaker 1>wheat and the country's progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't stop them.</v>

33
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.410
<v Speaker 1>If you take a static picture of Uruguay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see a country.</v>

34
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:00.500
<v Speaker 1>There's arguably is the best place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in all of South America.</v>

35
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.120
<v Speaker 1>If you take a static picture of Uruguay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you will see your country.</v>

36
00:02:07.121 --> 00:02:10.990
<v Speaker 1>There's arguably is the best place to </v>
<v Speaker 1>live in all of South America.</v>

37
00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:11.883
<v Speaker 1>Unlike Brazil and Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay is economy hasn't stopped </v>

38
00:02:14.681 --> 00:02:15.514
<v Speaker 1>growing since 2000 and to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thriving middle class since the highest </v>

39
00:02:18.791 --> 00:02:19.624
<v Speaker 1>wages in the region along with Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute because not </v>

40
00:02:22.391 --> 00:02:24.270
<v Speaker 1>everything is a field of roses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>ROSACEA.</v>

41
00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.080
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as such a prosperous country,</v>

42
00:02:26.081 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 1>you might expect it to have plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrant.</v>

43
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.130
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

44
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>the reality is actually ready </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference,</v>

45
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>and this is not because they have strong</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration laws,</v>

46
00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.220
<v Speaker 1>people just don't pick a Uruguayan as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country of residence because well,</v>

47
00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.800
<v Speaker 1>things are actually starting to go </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather sour.</v>

48
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:41.663
<v Speaker 1>They have around an 80 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment rates and that economic </v>

49
00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:45.390
<v Speaker 1>growth speed is reducing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

50
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:46.343
<v Speaker 1>Other countries like Peru and Chile </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed to offer opportunities for </v>

51
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.943
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today's question is why has </v>

52
00:02:51.181 --> 00:02:54.030
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayans economy worked out so well </v>
<v Speaker 1>until now?</v>

53
00:02:54.031 --> 00:02:54.864
<v Speaker 1>Ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the current problems they're </v>

54
00:02:55.621 --> 00:02:56.311
<v Speaker 1>facing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:02:56.311 --> 00:02:57.960
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer all of those</v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

56
00:02:57.961 --> 00:02:58.794
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history </v>

57
00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.330
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland.</v>

58
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.080
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayan was born in 1830 after a war </v>
<v Speaker 1>between Brazil and Argentina,</v>

59
00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.330
<v Speaker 1>the British words and negotiate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace agreements,</v>

60
00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.480
<v Speaker 1>and they badly wanted Uruguay required </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be an independent country.</v>

61
00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:19.200
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

62
00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.220
<v Speaker 1>Why was this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.063
<v Speaker 1>Montevideo is harbor was a jewel and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't want it ending up in </v>

64
00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:26.970
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian or Argentinian enhance back </v>
<v Speaker 1>then Uruguay.</v>

65
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.863
<v Speaker 1>It was almost uninhabited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was inhabited by a tribe called the </v>

66
00:03:30.101 --> 00:03:32.490
<v Speaker 1>Cero [inaudible],</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were soon exterminated.</v>

67
00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:33.383
<v Speaker 1>This is why unlike many other South </v>
<v Speaker 1>American countries and most of </v>

68
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:36.414
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayans have a European ethnicity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly Spanish and Italian roots in </v>

69
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:40.884
<v Speaker 1>those times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are an ambitious boy looking for </v>

70
00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.970
<v Speaker 1>a career and an opportunity to make </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

71
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.863
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay was the place to go.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was better than America and it was </v>

72
00:03:48.511 --> 00:03:49.344
<v Speaker 1>better than Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a modern democracy with rule of </v>

73
00:03:51.721 --> 00:03:52.580
<v Speaker 1>law and a thriving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

74
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.433
<v Speaker 2>Economy</v>

75
00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.390
<v Speaker 1>until the sixties of the 20th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country was among the wealthiest in</v>

76
00:04:00.391 --> 00:04:01.224
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was way richer than many European </v>

77
00:04:03.121 --> 00:04:04.110
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact.</v>

78
00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.250
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

79
00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.113
<v Speaker 1>what exactly happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because despite being prosperous among </v>

80
00:04:08.371 --> 00:04:12.540
<v Speaker 1>South American nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay is still way behind any European</v>

81
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:14.220
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let alone America.</v>

82
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.000
<v Speaker 1>So what happens to make them stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing so dramatically?</v>

83
00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer lies in the whole things.</v>

84
00:04:20.641 --> 00:04:22.140
<v Speaker 1>The European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

85
00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.890
<v Speaker 1>You heard me right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Devita.</v>

86
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 1>If you thought this idea of a trade war </v>
<v Speaker 1>was donald trump's invention on the very</v>

87
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:29.334
<v Speaker 1>mistaken in the year 1958,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European single market was created </v>

88
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.490
<v Speaker 1>and one of the first things they did was</v>
<v Speaker 1>to protect their agriculture from</v>

89
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.013
<v Speaker 2>neat</v>

90
00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 1>meant that rule quite lost their biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>customer.</v>

91
00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:46.120
<v Speaker 1>The United States didn't want to trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>with them either.</v>

92
00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:47.013
<v Speaker 1>It was in the middle of the Cold War and</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were too busy dealing with bigger </v>

93
00:04:49.631 --> 00:04:52.270
<v Speaker 1>problems than this little country to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>attention.</v>

94
00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:57.340
<v Speaker 1>So Day by day Uruguayan became stagnant </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the government's in Montevideo,</v>

95
00:04:57.341 --> 00:04:58.174
<v Speaker 1>the country's capital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They didn't have any other alternative </v>

96
00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 1>than to look to their neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

97
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:03.813
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay and Argentina became something </v>

98
00:05:05.441 --> 00:05:09.130
<v Speaker 1>like the Robert Rodriguez and Quintin </v>
<v Speaker 1>Tarantino of South America.</v>

99
00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.320
<v Speaker 1>Argentina had a financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so did Uruguay.</v>

100
00:05:12.321 --> 00:05:14.470
<v Speaker 1>If Argentina had a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship,</v>

101
00:05:14.471 --> 00:05:17.110
<v Speaker 1>well suited Uruguay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina had a democracy.</v>

102
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

103
00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:19.203
<v Speaker 1>so data Uruguay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So Dev you are well what happens in </v>

104
00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.270
<v Speaker 1>Argentina in the year 2002?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:05:25.271 --> 00:05:29.230
<v Speaker 1>they have the biggest financial crisis </v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of history.</v>

106
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.860
<v Speaker 1>The now in famous Carlita ends in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>very same year.</v>

107
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.560
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayans GDP fell by seven point seven</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>

108
00:05:35.561 --> 00:05:37.510
<v Speaker 1>which was a big time catastrophe.</v>

109
00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:45.380
<v Speaker 1>And this was when I realized they had to</v>
<v Speaker 1>find new trade partners,</v>

110
00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.840
<v Speaker 1>but how would they do that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

111
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:48.793
<v Speaker 1>let's look into it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Zero kilometer of South America during </v>

112
00:05:53.781 --> 00:05:54.614
<v Speaker 1>the 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayan returns to democracy and the </v>

113
00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:59.150
<v Speaker 1>government did something really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really interesting.</v>

114
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.840
<v Speaker 1>They created the so called Zonis </v>
<v Speaker 1>frankness.</v>

115
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:05.750
<v Speaker 1>These were special territory's inside of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country where companies were free to</v>

116
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.940
<v Speaker 1>not pay taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no VAT,</v>

117
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:09.500
<v Speaker 1>no income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no corporate tax.</v>

118
00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.790
<v Speaker 1>The only request was that 75 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the jobs that are given to locals.</v>

119
00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.833
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this reminds you of something </v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's pretty much the same idea </v>

120
00:06:16.671 --> 00:06:17.504
<v Speaker 1>as the special economic zones that exist</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China that we liked so much here at </v>

121
00:06:20.331 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 1>visual Polish,</v>

122
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.903
<v Speaker 2>sick</v>

123
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:25.620
<v Speaker 3>or acquire has 11 tax freeze,</v>

124
00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:31.960
<v Speaker 2>the three d</v>

125
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:33.003
<v Speaker 3>different kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 3>First we have those oriented to </v>

126
00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:35.853
<v Speaker 3>logistics and international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 3>After that we have the zones that are </v>

127
00:06:38.171 --> 00:06:39.004
<v Speaker 3>designed for attracting multinational </v>
<v Speaker 3>corporations that can use them as the </v>

128
00:06:41.891 --> 00:06:46.891
<v Speaker 3>headquarters for the South American.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Finally,</v>

129
00:06:48.221 --> 00:06:49.054
<v Speaker 3>we have the areas that are meant to have</v>
<v Speaker 3>high tech industry and this is why or </v>

130
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:52.873
<v Speaker 3>requires a regional leader and things </v>
<v Speaker 3>such as pharmaceutical research and </v>

131
00:06:55.991 --> 00:06:56.660
<v Speaker 3>software,</v>

132
00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:57.493
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These tax free zones have a unique </v>

133
00:07:00.651 --> 00:07:03.620
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something that makes Uruguay a model for</v>

134
00:07:03.621 --> 00:07:04.940
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

135
00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.720
<v Speaker 1>if you are here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about political stability.</v>

136
00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:09.643
<v Speaker 1>In the year 2005 Uruguayan changed its </v>
<v Speaker 1>government leadership and they had lost </v>

137
00:07:13.631 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 1>a left wing presidents that would be to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad Vasquez from the open friends party.</v>

138
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.270
<v Speaker 1>You see in most South American </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

139
00:07:20.271 --> 00:07:21.104
<v Speaker 1>having such an ideological shift in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government means that most of the work </v>

140
00:07:23.900 --> 00:07:27.590
<v Speaker 1>made by the previous administrations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something goes into the trash.</v>

141
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:32.950
<v Speaker 4>Okay,</v>

142
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:35.890
<v Speaker 1>so you might think that under a brand </v>
<v Speaker 1>new left wing government,</v>

143
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.220
<v Speaker 1>those tax resigns would no longer exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice.</v>

144
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality,</v>

145
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:41.253
<v Speaker 1>it actually couldn't be more different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is the great thing about this </v>

146
00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bipartisan consensus.</v>

147
00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:48.333
<v Speaker 1>This is why between 2005 and 2014,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the accumulated investment in these tax </v>

148
00:07:52.571 --> 00:07:53.404
<v Speaker 1>free zones rose to almost $6,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all of this happens while first </v>

149
00:07:57.431 --> 00:08:00.490
<v Speaker 1>Vasquez and then Jose Mojica managed the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

150
00:08:03.380 --> 00:08:06.250
<v Speaker 1>She will keep them here for not looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>only for profit.</v>

151
00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.790
<v Speaker 1>They also want safety and this is what </v>
<v Speaker 1>roadway has to offer.</v>

152
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.130
<v Speaker 1>It's not a matter of this or the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

153
00:08:12.131 --> 00:08:17.131
<v Speaker 1>He is a genuine attitudinal neck.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The emily one's a well,</v>

154
00:08:18.701 --> 00:08:21.790
<v Speaker 1>what does Uruguayan get from these tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>free zones?</v>

155
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:24.100
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is a double benefits of them.</v>

156
00:08:24.101 --> 00:08:25.360
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

157
00:08:25.430 --> 00:08:26.263
<v Speaker 1>they are able to appeal to industries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that otherwise would have set up in </v>

158
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:33.160
<v Speaker 1>other countries with bigger markets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>these foreign companies need providers.</v>

159
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:34.023
<v Speaker 1>This is why sooner than expected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many small enterprises are created </v>

160
00:08:37.150 --> 00:08:37.983
<v Speaker 1>around the country and of course they </v>
<v Speaker 1>require highly skilled labor and that </v>

161
00:08:41.231 --> 00:08:42.064
<v Speaker 1>means good salaries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why Uruguayans do need to </v>

162
00:08:44.231 --> 00:08:46.330
<v Speaker 1>emigrate in order to find a good one</v>

163
00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:51.460
<v Speaker 4>job.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The</v>

164
00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.633
<v Speaker 1>of the moments here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because we said that Uruguayan needs to </v>

165
00:08:54.461 --> 00:08:56.240
<v Speaker 1>change trade partners,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

166
00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:57.203
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you remember how we said that they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could no longer depends on Argentina or </v>

167
00:08:59.941 --> 00:09:02.460
<v Speaker 1>Brazil for their exports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you might not be wondering,</v>

168
00:09:02.461 --> 00:09:03.294
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what did the tax free zones have to do </v>

169
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.360
<v Speaker 1>with all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

170
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:07.253
<v Speaker 1>just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to these innovative industries </v>

171
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:09.923
<v Speaker 1>that set up in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayan could stop relying on the </v>

172
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:16.220
<v Speaker 1>commodity of sex prior to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their economy was based mainly on it and</v>

173
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.063
<v Speaker 1>don't meet today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They create products that have more </v>

174
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.633
<v Speaker 1>value added.</v>

175
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:26.343
<v Speaker 1>Giving you an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of the Syrup and he did in Pepsi </v>

176
00:09:28.061 --> 00:09:32.050
<v Speaker 1>drinks sold across all of South America </v>
<v Speaker 1>is created in Uruguay.</v>

177
00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:32.943
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a particular type of Pepsi in </v>

178
00:09:33.851 --> 00:09:34.684
<v Speaker 1>Japan called Pepsi Zukie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is made with a plant called sweet </v>

179
00:09:37.570 --> 00:09:38.470
<v Speaker 1>theme,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and again,</v>

180
00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:43.060
<v Speaker 1>the Sarah for this beverage is produced </v>
<v Speaker 1>a 200 kilometers away from Montevideo in</v>

181
00:09:43.061 --> 00:09:43.894
<v Speaker 1>total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pepsi represents seven percent of </v>

182
00:09:45.700 --> 00:09:47.620
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country exports,</v>

183
00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 1>and this is not the only example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest papermaking companies</v>

184
00:09:50.891 --> 00:09:51.724
<v Speaker 1>on the planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Finnish company called UPM has one of </v>

185
00:09:54.281 --> 00:09:55.114
<v Speaker 1>them main factories in Uruguay and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they've already announced the </v>

186
00:09:57.821 --> 00:09:58.654
<v Speaker 1>construction of a brand new facility </v>
<v Speaker 1>that might represent a whole two point </v>

187
00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 1>five percent extra GDP for the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that isn't enough,</v>

188
00:10:05.321 --> 00:10:07.780
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay is also a software leader</v>

189
00:10:12.930 --> 00:10:16.780
<v Speaker 1>or acquiring software developers among </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best in all of Latin America.</v>

190
00:10:16.810 --> 00:10:17.643
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>30 percent of Uruguay's exports are </v>

191
00:10:19.541 --> 00:10:22.720
<v Speaker 1>produced from these tax free zones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>

192
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:24.080
<v Speaker 1>here's the main buyer here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

193
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:27.610
<v Speaker 1>let me give you a clue.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It starts with a C and h and I,</v>

194
00:10:27.611 --> 00:10:28.444
<v Speaker 1>and it ends in an A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays Brazil and Argentina received </v>

195
00:10:31.591 --> 00:10:34.390
<v Speaker 1>just 20 percent of this country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports.</v>

196
00:10:34.450 --> 00:10:36.460
<v Speaker 1>I don't think a friend of your required </v>
<v Speaker 1>is the Netherlands.</v>

197
00:10:36.461 --> 00:10:37.294
<v Speaker 1>The Rotterdam harder is the gateway to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe as many of the Uruguayan exports </v>

198
00:10:40.721 --> 00:10:43.360
<v Speaker 1>go that way to make a comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chili's economy,</v>

199
00:10:43.361 --> 00:10:45.310
<v Speaker 1>despite being the wealthiest in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>

200
00:10:45.311 --> 00:10:47.560
<v Speaker 1>is heavily reliant on that copper </v>
<v Speaker 1>mining,</v>

201
00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:51.280
<v Speaker 1>half of their exports of this commodity </v>
<v Speaker 1>alone Uruguay.</v>

202
00:10:51.281 --> 00:10:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got a diversified economy.</v>

203
00:10:53.560 --> 00:10:55.780
<v Speaker 1>We've talked about software,</v>
<v Speaker 1>paper drinks,</v>

204
00:10:55.810 --> 00:10:56.643
<v Speaker 1>and of course cy and nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you thought of everything is all </v>

205
00:10:58.921 --> 00:11:01.350
<v Speaker 1>sunshine and rainbows and hold on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

206
00:11:01.351 --> 00:11:05.070
<v Speaker 1>it's because things are not quite as </v>
<v Speaker 1>perfect as you might think.</v>

207
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.850
<v Speaker 1>Party versus government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>

208
00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:16.990
<v Speaker 1>since the year 2005 Uruguay has had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>left wing governments,</v>

209
00:11:17.050 --> 00:11:17.883
<v Speaker 1>more specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country has been managed by the </v>

210
00:11:20.890 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Open Front Party and one thing is </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly true.</v>

211
00:11:23.740 --> 00:11:24.573
<v Speaker 1>They are worthy of that name because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is really an open policy with plenty of </v>

212
00:11:28.511 --> 00:11:31.930
<v Speaker 1>different ideologies inside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why despite what it looks like,</v>

213
00:11:31.990 --> 00:11:34.270
<v Speaker 1>arguments a pretty common thing in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>potty.</v>

214
00:11:37.450 --> 00:11:39.490
<v Speaker 1>So on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the different presidents,</v>

215
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:43.180
<v Speaker 1>why hasn't the same finance minister for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 30 years?</v>

216
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.073
<v Speaker 1>His name is denny Louis' story and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>could say that he's one of the </v>

217
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.450
<v Speaker 1>architects of this Uruguayans too,</v>

218
00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.010
<v Speaker 4>but on the other is the open front</v>

219
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:54.843
<v Speaker 1>is really a battle fronts between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical wing as the moderate wing </v>

220
00:11:58.151 --> 00:12:02.320
<v Speaker 1>champions by two that Vasquez hosting me</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the left wing Rockstar,</v>

221
00:12:02.321 --> 00:12:03.154
<v Speaker 1>he's somewhere in the middle and this is</v>
<v Speaker 1>why anytime Uruguayan government wants </v>

222
00:12:06.071 --> 00:12:08.440
<v Speaker 1>to sign a free trade deal with any other</v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

223
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 1>they must face that own party </v>
<v Speaker 1>opposition.</v>

224
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.770
<v Speaker 1>It happens during the first Vasquez </v>
<v Speaker 1>administration when they tried to sign a</v>

225
00:12:14.771 --> 00:12:15.604
<v Speaker 1>deal with the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It happens when they tried to sign a </v>

226
00:12:17.771 --> 00:12:21.970
<v Speaker 1>deal with Chili and it might not happen </v>
<v Speaker 1>as they want to sign a deal with China.</v>

227
00:12:22.110 --> 00:12:23.440
<v Speaker 3>In Atlanta,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emilia,</v>

228
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:25.483
<v Speaker 3>2018,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we will mark the 30 years of diplomatic </v>

229
00:12:27.781 --> 00:12:32.781
<v Speaker 3>relations with China and this is why we </v>
<v Speaker 3>have put this date as a deadline to sign</v>

230
00:12:32.941 --> 00:12:33.960
<v Speaker 3>a free trade deal.</v>

231
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.400
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguayan companies would save more than</v>

232
00:12:36.401 --> 00:12:39.010
<v Speaker 1>$100,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in needless tariffs,</v>

233
00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.873
<v Speaker 1>but this radical wing of the open front </v>
<v Speaker 1>seems to be allergic to the word free </v>

234
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:45.790
<v Speaker 1>trade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if this was not enough,</v>

235
00:12:45.791 --> 00:12:50.460
<v Speaker 1>some critics claim that Daniella a story</v>
<v Speaker 1>the finance minister spends to missile.</v>

236
00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:53.293
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

237
00:12:53.410 --> 00:12:57.730
<v Speaker 3>this is actually one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 3>problems in IRC required after Venezuela</v>

238
00:12:57.731 --> 00:12:58.564
<v Speaker 3>and Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Uruguay has the largest share of civil </v>

239
00:13:01.331 --> 00:13:02.164
<v Speaker 3>servants in the region.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One out of five workers is employed by </v>

240
00:13:05.111 --> 00:13:05.944
<v Speaker 3>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and if you add to this the enormous </v>

241
00:13:07.331 --> 00:13:08.164
<v Speaker 3>presence of an illegal economy,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you'll understand why just one third of </v>

242
00:13:12.100 --> 00:13:15.580
<v Speaker 3>adults work for private companies in </v>
<v Speaker 3>most developed nations,</v>

243
00:13:15.581 --> 00:13:16.720
<v Speaker 3>this number is more than half.</v>

244
00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>compared with Argentina or Brazil.</v>

245
00:13:24.331 --> 00:13:25.164
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay is a paradise on earth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is if they wanted to keep </v>

246
00:13:28.381 --> 00:13:29.214
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must solve these problems as soon </v>

247
00:13:31.231 --> 00:13:32.064
<v Speaker 1>as possible.</v>

248
00:13:35.070 --> 00:13:35.960
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>

249
00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:36.983
<v Speaker 1>Now the final question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think Uruguay should sign those </v>

250
00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:42.780
<v Speaker 1>free trade deals?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it is still worth investing</v>

251
00:13:42.781 --> 00:13:43.890
<v Speaker 1>in as a country?</v>
