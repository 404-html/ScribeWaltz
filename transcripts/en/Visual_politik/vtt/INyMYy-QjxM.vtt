1
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.183
<v Speaker 1>Just before we get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to give a quick plug for a new </v>

2
00:00:09.811 --> 00:00:13.860
<v Speaker 1>channel that I've started at school </v>
<v Speaker 1>biographics where we look at biographies</v>

3
00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.720
<v Speaker 1>of famous people from history as well as</v>
<v Speaker 1>the present day.</v>

4
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.200
<v Speaker 1>It's not all politics or that we have </v>
<v Speaker 1>done some politics.</v>

5
00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:22.120
<v Speaker 1>We've looked at Vladimir Putin as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as almost swartz and I got.</v>

6
00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.710
<v Speaker 1>I know he definitely covers both fields,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but please do check it out.</v>

7
00:00:25.711 --> 00:00:27.560
<v Speaker 1>There is a link in the description below</v>
<v Speaker 1>our,</v>

8
00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.413
<v Speaker 1>I'd say you probably know pieces of </v>
<v Speaker 1>field build companies and I support </v>

9
00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.990
<v Speaker 1>people who are building new things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was one of the founders of paypal,</v>

10
00:00:33.991 --> 00:00:34.824
<v Speaker 1>the first investor in facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and he's one of the most important </v>

11
00:00:37.081 --> 00:00:40.080
<v Speaker 1>technology and venture capital Gurus in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.220
<v Speaker 1>He's obviously a multibillionaire.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is also a bit of a peculiar guy.</v>

13
00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.083
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he financed projects like the Sea </v>

14
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.443
<v Speaker 1>Standing Institute in organization aimed</v>
<v Speaker 1>at being a politically autonomous </v>

15
00:00:50.251 --> 00:00:51.084
<v Speaker 1>floating city and is also funded anti </v>
<v Speaker 1>aging research by using the blood of </v>

16
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.290
<v Speaker 1>young people.</v>

17
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:56.143
<v Speaker 1>These are the thiel is also known for </v>
<v Speaker 1>being the biggest supporter of Donald </v>

18
00:00:58.980 --> 00:00:59.813
<v Speaker 1>Trump in silicon valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although in some conversations with </v>

19
00:01:01.891 --> 00:01:06.060
<v Speaker 1>journalists recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's already shown some concerns.</v>

20
00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.553
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell all of us have the right </v>

21
00:01:08.371 --> 00:01:10.610
<v Speaker 1>to be wrong sometimes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is this,</v>

22
00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:11.463
<v Speaker 1>in 2011 Peter Thiel was granted New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand citizenship and told his </v>

23
00:01:14.371 --> 00:01:16.170
<v Speaker 1>application.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He said this,</v>

24
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:17.723
<v Speaker 1>I'm happy to say categorically that I've</v>
<v Speaker 1>found no other country that aligns more </v>

25
00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:22.950
<v Speaker 1>with my view of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the New Zealand.</v>

26
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.080
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that this is probably no </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprise to you,</v>

27
00:01:25.081 --> 00:01:26.490
<v Speaker 1>regular viewers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic.</v>

28
00:01:26.491 --> 00:01:27.324
<v Speaker 1>We've already said into other videos how</v>
<v Speaker 1>much we love this country and not just </v>

29
00:01:29.911 --> 00:01:30.744
<v Speaker 1>for its beauty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although New Zealand is one of the most </v>

30
00:01:32.011 --> 00:01:35.190
<v Speaker 1>beautiful countries in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also an example to be followed</v>

31
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.043
<v Speaker 1>to take a look at these statements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All former prime minister billing about </v>

32
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:39.264
<v Speaker 1>his predecessor.</v>

33
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.713
<v Speaker 2>Occasionally John would come home and </v>
<v Speaker 2>complain that he was the only one who </v>

34
00:01:44.971 --> 00:01:45.804
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a jet and how his colleagues</v>
<v Speaker 2>were horrified to find that he as a </v>

35
00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:51.570
<v Speaker 2>world leader had to travel on commercial</v>
<v Speaker 2>aircraft,</v>

36
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.463
<v Speaker 2>but I assured him that it was character </v>
<v Speaker 2>building and kept them in touch with </v>

37
00:01:54.511 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 2>normal people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bill English,</v>

38
00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.490
<v Speaker 1>no New Zealand doesn't have an air force</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their own,</v>

39
00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.353
<v Speaker 1>but it is one of the easiest countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do business in and as we've already </v>

40
00:02:03.271 --> 00:02:04.760
<v Speaker 1>seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one of the most prosperous,</v>

41
00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.360
<v Speaker 1>least corrupt and safest countries on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the</v>

42
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:08.263
<v Speaker 3>planets.</v>

43
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.140
<v Speaker 1>Unless onto that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're first rate public services.</v>

44
00:02:19.141 --> 00:02:19.974
<v Speaker 1>Their ranking is one of the countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the highest standards of living as </v>

45
00:02:22.711 --> 00:02:24.990
<v Speaker 1>well as having one of the lowest </v>
<v Speaker 1>employment rates.</v>

46
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.050
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look at this chart.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't always like this.</v>

47
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.153
<v Speaker 1>The Sun didn't always ride.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no doubt that New Zealand is a </v>

48
00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:49.560
<v Speaker 1>top rate country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but things weren't always like that.</v>

49
00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:51.480
<v Speaker 1>I'm definitely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>

50
00:02:51.481 --> 00:02:52.314
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we are going to see now is a real </v>

51
00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:54.774
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The story of the country that was </v>

52
00:02:55.861 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>determined to learn from its mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to transform everything didn't work,</v>

53
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.760
<v Speaker 1>and by doing so become an international </v>
<v Speaker 1>role.</v>

54
00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is definitely not the norm.</v>

55
00:03:09.351 --> 00:03:13.580
<v Speaker 1>Placing people first before any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideology and the electorial interests.</v>

56
00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.430
<v Speaker 1>It's not so common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least not in most countries,</v>

57
00:03:16.431 --> 00:03:18.080
<v Speaker 1>but let's see what happens.</v>

58
00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:22.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we have to say is that </v>

59
00:03:23.191 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand was always a relatively </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealthy country.</v>

60
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:27.660
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the late 19 fifties,</v>

61
00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.810
<v Speaker 1>this country had the third highest per </v>
<v Speaker 1>capita income in the world,</v>

62
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.750
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly not bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

63
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.093
<v Speaker 1>Just wait a moment because that's the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment when things started to get a bit </v>

64
00:03:39.001 --> 00:03:40.050
<v Speaker 1>worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad enough.</v>

65
00:03:40.051 --> 00:03:41.400
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the by 1984,</v>

66
00:03:41.401 --> 00:03:45.000
<v Speaker 1>the per capita income was similar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>that of Portugal or Turkey.</v>

67
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.230
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well now you're probably wondering,</v>

68
00:03:46.231 --> 00:03:49.770
<v Speaker 1>well what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but New Zealand's to drop so far.</v>

69
00:03:49.771 --> 00:03:51.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be said that the government,</v>

70
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.220
<v Speaker 1>they went a bit too far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By that time,</v>

71
00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.083
<v Speaker 1>the government of New Zealand had </v>
<v Speaker 1>meddled with the economy to such an </v>

72
00:03:56.161 --> 00:03:58.770
<v Speaker 1>extent that it's hard to even imagine </v>
<v Speaker 1>what it was like.</v>

73
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>There were many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many taxes.</v>

74
00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:10.290
<v Speaker 1>Most of them incredibly complex and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>of them really,</v>

75
00:04:10.291 --> 00:04:12.540
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just so you can get an idea of that.</v>

76
00:04:12.541 --> 00:04:13.374
<v Speaker 1>The highest income tax rate was almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>70 percent and the lowest was still 40 </v>

77
00:04:17.701 --> 00:04:19.170
<v Speaker 1>percent and companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

78
00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:22.980
<v Speaker 1>they didn't get any better treatments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The profit tax was 48 percent,</v>

79
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.860
<v Speaker 1>which is twice as much as the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>average nowadays,</v>

80
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.100
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were tons of regulations.</v>

81
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:31.200
<v Speaker 1>There were price controls for almost any</v>
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>

82
00:04:31.201 --> 00:04:32.034
<v Speaker 1>currency controls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's just scratching the surface </v>

83
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.973
<v Speaker 1>as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Any import require the approval of the </v>

84
00:04:36.961 --> 00:04:40.740
<v Speaker 1>administration and it was really hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>for New Zealanders to invest their money</v>

85
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.070
<v Speaker 1>outside of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have foreign exchange controls.</v>

86
00:04:44.071 --> 00:04:44.904
<v Speaker 1>That meant I couldn't buy a subscription</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the Economist magazine without the </v>

87
00:04:47.821 --> 00:04:50.580
<v Speaker 1>permission of the Minister of Finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maurice,</v>

88
00:04:50.581 --> 00:04:53.460
<v Speaker 1>p mcteague,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former minister of the government of New</v>

89
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.140
<v Speaker 1>Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look the controls and regulations.</v>

90
00:04:55.141 --> 00:04:57.360
<v Speaker 1>They didn't just establish a minimum </v>
<v Speaker 1>wages.</v>

91
00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.970
<v Speaker 1>They also set caps for the maximum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

92
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.490
<v Speaker 1>You heard that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely right.</v>

93
00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.830
<v Speaker 1>But let's say that a business owner </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to pay a bonus to his workers.</v>

94
00:05:04.831 --> 00:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that wasn't an easy task</v>

95
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:07.613
<v Speaker 3>ask</v>

96
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.963
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the state owned and controlled almost </v>

97
00:05:15.651 --> 00:05:17.720
<v Speaker 1>every large national company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>

98
00:05:17.721 --> 00:05:19.070
<v Speaker 1>airlines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>insurance companies,</v>

99
00:05:19.071 --> 00:05:20.630
<v Speaker 1>banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even hotels.</v>

100
00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:23.540
<v Speaker 1>Yet the government was really managing </v>
<v Speaker 1>hotels.</v>

101
00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:25.190
<v Speaker 1>Not Joking here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in other words,</v>

102
00:05:25.191 --> 00:05:26.024
<v Speaker 1>the early 19 eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand was the very example of </v>

103
00:05:28.281 --> 00:05:29.114
<v Speaker 1>extreme statism in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost everything was controlled by </v>

104
00:05:32.361 --> 00:05:36.560
<v Speaker 1>bureaucrats and politicians and so well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what were the consequences of all this?</v>

105
00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.690
<v Speaker 1>They weren't exactly positive,</v>

106
00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.053
<v Speaker 3>right.</v>

107
00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.863
<v Speaker 1>After 23 years of deficits and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's balance public debt has </v>

108
00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.613
<v Speaker 1>absolutely skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was to figure unemployment's private </v>

109
00:05:51.621 --> 00:05:54.140
<v Speaker 1>investors were pulling out of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and the Kiwi youth,</v>

110
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.003
<v Speaker 1>while they were fleeing in huge numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>by that time doing business in New </v>

111
00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.293
<v Speaker 1>Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was an enormously complicated </v>

112
00:06:00.021 --> 00:06:01.340
<v Speaker 1>process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And to be honest,</v>

113
00:06:01.341 --> 00:06:02.174
<v Speaker 1>it was only attempted by the bravest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything started to change in 1984 </v>

114
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:11.260
<v Speaker 1>when elections took place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Plan to move forward</v>

115
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.340
<v Speaker 1>in 1984 in the midst of a tough crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections were celebrated.</v>

116
00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:27.930
<v Speaker 1>The winner was David longer you have the</v>
<v Speaker 1>center left party.</v>

117
00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:33.050
<v Speaker 1>This nation is at risk is how basic it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

118
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:34.493
<v Speaker 1>The new government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a purpose to overcome the </v>

119
00:06:36.391 --> 00:06:38.820
<v Speaker 1>crisis and still change the national </v>
<v Speaker 1>model.</v>

120
00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.330
<v Speaker 1>They are to replace everything that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't work and to make sure they did it</v>

121
00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:43.193
<v Speaker 1>without leaving anybody behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While at the same time granting the </v>

122
00:06:46.441 --> 00:06:48.720
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for others to move </v>
<v Speaker 1>forward.</v>

123
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.000
<v Speaker 1>So even though David [inaudible] was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister,</v>

124
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:51.834
<v Speaker 1>the leader of this whole process was the</v>
<v Speaker 1>minister of Finance and that was sent </v>

125
00:06:54.931 --> 00:06:56.490
<v Speaker 1>Roger Douglas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

126
00:06:56.491 --> 00:06:59.970
<v Speaker 1>the process is named after him.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's known as Roger Nomix.</v>

127
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.360
<v Speaker 1>We went probably from being the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated,</v>

128
00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:03.203
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the developed world to the least </v>

129
00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:08.790
<v Speaker 1>Reagan a regulator.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We actually discussed this in a previous</v>

130
00:07:08.791 --> 00:07:09.624
<v Speaker 1>video where we talked about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agricultural reforms that have been so </v>

131
00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:12.473
<v Speaker 1>successful in New Zealand is Roger </v>
<v Speaker 1>Douglas started and ambitious reform </v>

132
00:07:15.511 --> 00:07:16.344
<v Speaker 1>program known as Rajan Nanex in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>program that many areas of the economy </v>

133
00:07:19.831 --> 00:07:20.664
<v Speaker 1>were liberalized and this included the </v>
<v Speaker 1>primary sector and these changes took </v>

134
00:07:23.851 --> 00:07:24.684
<v Speaker 1>place almost overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Price controls were eliminated and most </v>

135
00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:31.830
<v Speaker 1>farming subsidies were removed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Roger Nomix,</v>

136
00:07:31.831 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just about agriculture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The plan affected almost every aspect of</v>

137
00:07:36.121 --> 00:07:38.460
<v Speaker 1>the state and created a new political </v>
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>

138
00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.323
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the time the rights international </v>

139
00:07:40.501 --> 00:07:43.230
<v Speaker 1>party won the elections in 1990 and took</v>
<v Speaker 1>power again,</v>

140
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:44.093
<v Speaker 1>everything had changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the new government followed the </v>

141
00:07:45.961 --> 00:07:47.730
<v Speaker 1>labor process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger Nomix.</v>

142
00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:48.593
<v Speaker 1>It was a political philosophy that </v>
<v Speaker 1>radically changed the country between </v>

143
00:07:50.971 --> 00:07:54.600
<v Speaker 1>the year 1984 and the beginnings of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>21st century.</v>

144
00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.900
<v Speaker 1>The first thing that the government did </v>
<v Speaker 1>was declared a war on bureaucracy.</v>

145
00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:10.450
<v Speaker 1>They did it in three ways.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

146
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:13.810
<v Speaker 1>they did a thorough analysis of every </v>
<v Speaker 1>governmental departments.</v>

147
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.673
<v Speaker 1>If what they did was not essential or </v>
<v Speaker 1>could be better done by the market as </v>

148
00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:18.790
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the end of it.</v>

149
00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:19.653
<v Speaker 1>Following the same pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They started an ambitious plan of </v>

150
00:08:21.701 --> 00:08:23.020
<v Speaker 1>privatization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

151
00:08:23.021 --> 00:08:24.850
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What was the state doing?</v>

152
00:08:24.851 --> 00:08:28.630
<v Speaker 1>Wasting time managing hotels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airlines or telecommunications,</v>

153
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:29.523
<v Speaker 1>thanks to competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The market could do a much better job </v>

154
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.120
<v Speaker 1>hands with less cost and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation.</v>

155
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:37.210
<v Speaker 1>Pie Come at it from an angle of what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>good for the consumer.</v>

156
00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:38.860
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the provider.</v>

157
00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:40.023
<v Speaker 1>I don't care a fundamentally who the </v>
<v Speaker 1>provider might be a might be a public </v>

158
00:08:43.661 --> 00:08:45.610
<v Speaker 1>institution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a private institution,</v>

159
00:08:45.611 --> 00:08:49.510
<v Speaker 1>so long as it serves the consumer or the</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxpayer.</v>

160
00:08:49.511 --> 00:08:50.344
<v Speaker 1>That's where I come from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seconds of the 35 remaining public </v>

161
00:08:53.531 --> 00:08:54.364
<v Speaker 1>agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government made management work </v>

162
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>under market conditions.</v>

163
00:08:57.090 --> 00:08:59.640
<v Speaker 1>This was the case for air traffic </v>
<v Speaker 1>controllers for instance.</v>

164
00:08:59.700 --> 00:09:02.100
<v Speaker 1>And the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were totally terrific.</v>

165
00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:02.963
<v Speaker 1>Not so neat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did the services of these public </v>

166
00:09:04.201 --> 00:09:05.034
<v Speaker 1>agencies improve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They went from costing the government a </v>

167
00:09:07.710 --> 00:09:08.543
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars every year to generating</v>
<v Speaker 1>with taxes and profits more than a </v>

168
00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:12.653
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is money that could then be put </v>

169
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:16.710
<v Speaker 1>into things like education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health care and culture.</v>

170
00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.430
<v Speaker 1>But that wasn't the end of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since regulations and laws were numerous</v>

171
00:09:20.431 --> 00:09:21.264
<v Speaker 1>and complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government decided to work towards </v>

172
00:09:22.951 --> 00:09:23.784
<v Speaker 1>an important goal and that was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>simplification and elimination of any </v>

173
00:09:27.151 --> 00:09:27.984
<v Speaker 1>laws that they deemed unnecessary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And so what was the result of all of </v>

174
00:09:30.901 --> 00:09:31.734
<v Speaker 1>these changes when you started this </v>
<v Speaker 1>process with the Department of </v>

175
00:09:34.710 --> 00:09:36.120
<v Speaker 1>Transportation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It had 5,600</v>

176
00:09:36.121 --> 00:09:38.280
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we finished it had 53.</v>

177
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>When we started with the forest service,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had 17,000</v>

178
00:09:40.981 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>employees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When we finished it had 17.</v>

179
00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.160
<v Speaker 1>Maurice p mcteague ends unemployment's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It didn't increase.</v>

180
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
<v Speaker 1>It was reduced.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So there's this very illustrative story </v>

181
00:09:50.101 --> 00:09:52.710
<v Speaker 1>and it actually involves deer as in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

182
00:09:52.740 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 1>So when the British arrived in New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zealand,</v>

183
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:56.220
<v Speaker 1>the country doesn't have any large </v>
<v Speaker 1>animals.</v>

184
00:09:56.221 --> 00:09:59.520
<v Speaker 1>So the wealthy families,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they imported deer for hunting as well.</v>

185
00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.790
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess what happens these days?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They spread rapidly,</v>

186
00:10:02.791 --> 00:10:03.624
<v Speaker 1>forming the massive herds that ghost </v>
<v Speaker 1>critical ecological damage by </v>

187
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:07.433
<v Speaker 1>overgrazing thought 120 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The state had spent a lot of money </v>

188
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:14.250
<v Speaker 1>trying to think this plague in order to </v>
<v Speaker 1>preserve the local ecosystem.</v>

189
00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.690
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

190
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:24.213
<v Speaker 1>one day they came up with a new idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why couldn't they let farmers hunt and </v>

191
00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:28.780
<v Speaker 1>raised the deer fence?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

192
00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:30.850
<v Speaker 1>that's exactly what they did.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not saying that you did this,</v>

193
00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:34.510
<v Speaker 1>put an end to the plague.</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand today is the world's largest</v>

194
00:10:34.511 --> 00:10:35.344
<v Speaker 1>supplier of deer meat and all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really does make sense and it's also </v>

195
00:10:38.351 --> 00:10:41.740
<v Speaker 1>interesting to see what happened to </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes which were simplified in Regina.</v>

196
00:10:47.120 --> 00:10:47.953
<v Speaker 1>Many were surprised by the results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tax Collection actually increased by 20 </v>

197
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:52.454
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

198
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.253
<v Speaker 1>The subsidization.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was cost not only in agriculture but </v>

199
00:11:05.721 --> 00:11:06.554
<v Speaker 1>also in industry sectors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there was much more than just </v>

200
00:11:08.871 --> 00:11:09.704
<v Speaker 1>economic reform here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reforms that reached the public </v>

201
00:11:11.481 --> 00:11:14.210
<v Speaker 1>services and take a look at what happens</v>
<v Speaker 1>with education.</v>

202
00:11:14.211 --> 00:11:16.420
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the education budget of New Zealand.</v>

203
00:11:16.421 --> 00:11:18.830
<v Speaker 1>It hadn't stopped growing for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the results,</v>

204
00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:21.500
<v Speaker 1>they were just getting worse and worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question was,</v>

205
00:11:21.501 --> 00:11:22.334
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a we students getting more stupid and </v>

206
00:11:23.910 --> 00:11:27.290
<v Speaker 1>that didn't really seem likely so when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government analyze the causes,</v>

207
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>they realize this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an important share of the budget was not</v>

208
00:11:29.901 --> 00:11:33.320
<v Speaker 1>actually being spent on education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on administration.</v>

209
00:11:33.380 --> 00:11:36.350
<v Speaker 1>These were quality evaluation agencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>rating firms,</v>

210
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.040
<v Speaker 1>dossie agencies and so on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did the government decide to do?</v>

211
00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.500
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they simply removed it all and they gave</v>

212
00:11:42.501 --> 00:11:46.130
<v Speaker 1>the schools control with a management </v>
<v Speaker 1>board chosen by the parents.</v>

213
00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:50.993
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they allow parents to choose schools </v>

214
00:11:51.871 --> 00:11:53.190
<v Speaker 1>freely,</v>
<v Speaker 1>private or public,</v>

215
00:11:53.230 --> 00:11:55.300
<v Speaker 1>and the government would pay for it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>

216
00:11:55.301 --> 00:11:59.380
<v Speaker 1>what we can tell you now is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>education results improved significantly</v>

217
00:11:59.470 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing,</v>

218
00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>it happens with everything else.</v>

219
00:12:05.750 --> 00:12:06.583
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a prosperous country with a very </v>

220
00:12:08.121 --> 00:12:10.760
<v Speaker 1>high standard of living and to use </v>
<v Speaker 1>public services,</v>

221
00:12:10.761 --> 00:12:13.790
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health and culture are among the best in</v>

222
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:15.900
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that leaves us thinking that museum,</v>

223
00:12:15.901 --> 00:12:16.734
<v Speaker 1>that it's an amazing example for </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in Latin America or some </v>

224
00:12:19.101 --> 00:12:21.140
<v Speaker 1>European countries like Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Italy,</v>

225
00:12:21.170 --> 00:12:22.340
<v Speaker 1>Greece,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Portugal.</v>

226
00:12:22.370 --> 00:12:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if anything is for certain,</v>

227
00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:26.660
<v Speaker 1>is that the lands of Kiwis is a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

228
00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:27.553
<v Speaker 1>And now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that New Zealand makes a </v>

229
00:12:29.031 --> 00:12:30.530
<v Speaker 1>good model to be followed?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

230
00:12:30.531 --> 00:12:32.480
<v Speaker 1>please do leave your onset in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments below.</v>

231
00:12:32.481 --> 00:12:34.850
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to hear from you and also in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this survey.</v>

232
