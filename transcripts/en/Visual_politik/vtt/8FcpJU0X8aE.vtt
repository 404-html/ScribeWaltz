1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.850
<v Speaker 1>It's finally here off several failures </v>
<v Speaker 1>and a few scandals.</v>

2
00:00:02.851 --> 00:00:03.684
<v Speaker 1>2017 closed with Donald Trump hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the republican party's first major </v>

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:08.064
<v Speaker 1>political victory since the presidential</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections that landed the well known </v>

4
00:00:10.591 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>casino and property developments magnate</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the Oval Office.</v>

5
00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:19.481
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

6
00:00:19.481 --> 00:00:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Talking about the tax reform that after </v>
<v Speaker 1>being approved by Congress was signed by</v>

7
00:00:23.501 --> 00:00:26.890
<v Speaker 1>President Trump on December the 22nd </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017</v>

8
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.310
<v Speaker 2>three point $2 trillion in tax cuts for </v>
<v Speaker 2>American families,</v>

9
00:00:31.311 --> 00:00:32.144
<v Speaker 2>including the doubling of the standard </v>
<v Speaker 2>deduction and the doubling of the child </v>

10
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.520
<v Speaker 2>tax credit.</v>

11
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.510
<v Speaker 1>This is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure you've heard,</v>

12
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.373
<v Speaker 1>the largest tax reform in 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The impacts and the controls have been </v>

13
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.263
<v Speaker 1>massive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's appropriate for the </v>

14
00:00:46.711 --> 00:00:48.270
<v Speaker 1>importance of this political</v>

15
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.223
<v Speaker 3>events.</v>

16
00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:56.590
<v Speaker 1>Print supporters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The tax reform is a real revolution,</v>

17
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.433
<v Speaker 1>as many qualifiers as the biggest tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduction in the history of the United </v>

18
00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.880
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is good for American business.</v>

19
00:01:03.881 --> 00:01:04.714
<v Speaker 1>It's good for the American economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's good for the American people </v>

20
00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:08.020
<v Speaker 1>for its detractors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

21
00:01:08.021 --> 00:01:11.800
<v Speaker 1>the reform is poorly developed and lies </v>
<v Speaker 1>far from the promises that the president</v>

22
00:01:11.801 --> 00:01:13.430
<v Speaker 1>made during his electoral campaign</v>

23
00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.160
<v Speaker 2>tax.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The florists.</v>

24
00:01:15.161 --> 00:01:16.560
<v Speaker 2>People.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.650
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Other 35,000 book will be taxed the most</v>

26
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.753
<v Speaker 2>under 75,000 will be the second highest </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech and the billionaires and the </v>

27
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.970
<v Speaker 2>millionaires get a tax guy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's wrong with this picture?</v>

28
00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.260
<v Speaker 1>So I think the questions to be asked </v>
<v Speaker 1>here are very clear.</v>

29
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.790
<v Speaker 1>We have to ask what's true in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

30
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:36.720
<v Speaker 1>what's it really all about and is it as </v>
<v Speaker 1>large as people are saying?</v>

31
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.000
<v Speaker 1>And ultimately what can everyone expect </v>
<v Speaker 1>from this?</v>

32
00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.320
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look.</v>

33
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.080
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

34
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.913
<v Speaker 1>In this video where they explored the </v>
<v Speaker 1>positive and also the not so positive </v>

35
00:01:52.561 --> 00:01:53.394
<v Speaker 1>aspects of a reform that is its first </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequence as managed to calm the </v>

36
00:01:55.951 --> 00:01:56.784
<v Speaker 1>waters in the Republican party in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reconcile Donald Trump with the party </v>

37
00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:05.010
<v Speaker 1>leaders of both chambers of Congress and</v>
<v Speaker 1>given how things were going after a year</v>

38
00:02:05.011 --> 00:02:08.940
<v Speaker 1>of taunts attacks and mistrust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is really worth acknowledging.</v>

39
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.660
<v Speaker 1>Check out what the media says.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just a few short months ago,</v>

40
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.290
<v Speaker 4>president had been a very focused,</v>
<v Speaker 4>of course on a well his twitter account.</v>

41
00:02:17.291 --> 00:02:18.124
<v Speaker 4>He fired off another twitter storm </v>
<v Speaker 4>yesterday about his frustrations with </v>

42
00:02:21.011 --> 00:02:23.050
<v Speaker 4>party leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Mitch Mcconnell and Paul Ryan.</v>

43
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.420
<v Speaker 4>I with all the invitee?</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

44
00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.263
<v Speaker 4>in the GOP.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Do Democrats have a political advantage </v>

45
00:02:27.791 --> 00:02:28.120
<v Speaker 4>now?</v>

46
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we go on,</v>

47
00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.020
<v Speaker 1>what can we expect?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's see what this law at tax reduction</v>

48
00:02:32.021 --> 00:02:34.180
<v Speaker 1>within the United States really means.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:35.014
<v Speaker 1>the first question we need to answer is </v>
<v Speaker 1>how much does it really actually reduce </v>

50
00:02:38.091 --> 00:02:38.924
<v Speaker 1>taxes?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is this really the biggest tax drop in </v>

51
00:02:41.441 --> 00:02:42.560
<v Speaker 1>US history?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

52
00:02:42.561 --> 00:02:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump certainly has his steak </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

53
00:02:45.461 --> 00:02:46.294
<v Speaker 1>It was my great honor to sign the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest tax cuts and reform in the </v>

54
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:50.344
<v Speaker 1>history of our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So according to the president and also </v>

55
00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:53.403
<v Speaker 1>many Republican Party politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans are facing a great fiscal </v>

56
00:02:56.261 --> 00:02:59.080
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A revolution that could make even Ronald</v>

57
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.420
<v Speaker 1>Reagan's cuts look pretty tiny</v>

58
00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.100
<v Speaker 5>is this is the biggest tax cuts and </v>
<v Speaker 5>reform in the history of our country.</v>

59
00:03:05.101 --> 00:03:08.040
<v Speaker 5>This is bigger than actually president </v>
<v Speaker 5>Reagan's.</v>

60
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.850
<v Speaker 5>How</v>

61
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:12.120
<v Speaker 1>ever dear viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before you launch your celebration,</v>

62
00:03:12.121 --> 00:03:12.954
<v Speaker 1>please do wait a minute because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>already know that donald isn't </v>

63
00:03:15.301 --> 00:03:18.270
<v Speaker 1>particularly fond of the truth and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what?</v>

64
00:03:18.271 --> 00:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>While this time it's really not any </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

65
00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

66
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.503
<v Speaker 1>sadly that is right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This fiscal reform isn't the largest in </v>

67
00:03:28.521 --> 00:03:29.990
<v Speaker 1>US history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed not at all.</v>

68
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:31.650
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even among the top five.</v>

69
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though we can say that Americans </v>

70
00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:38.200
<v Speaker 1>are facing the biggest tax system reform</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 30 years,</v>

71
00:03:38.201 --> 00:03:40.060
<v Speaker 1>because this law does change a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

72
00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:42.460
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowering taxes,</v>

73
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:43.473
<v Speaker 1>it's really not that impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general estimates is that this </v>

74
00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:45.994
<v Speaker 1>reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll lower taxes between 0.7 and 0.9% </v>

75
00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:50.343
<v Speaker 1>of the GDP over the next 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is approximately one point $5 </v>

76
00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.311
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

77
00:03:54.311 --> 00:03:55.144
<v Speaker 1>the fact is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the committee for a </v>

78
00:03:56.231 --> 00:03:57.064
<v Speaker 1>responsible federal budget and </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent think tank and also </v>

79
00:03:59.051 --> 00:03:59.884
<v Speaker 1>according to the u s treasury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually the eighth largest tax </v>

80
00:04:02.321 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>reduction since 1918 indeed it is three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times smaller than Reagan.</v>

81
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.430
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>

82
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.263
<v Speaker 1>The problem here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may actually be the Donald Trump is </v>

83
00:04:14.771 --> 00:04:16.090
<v Speaker 1>simply allergic to the trees,</v>

84
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:19.000
<v Speaker 3>but anyway.</v>

85
00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.833
<v Speaker 1>Nice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the main points of this tax </v>

86
00:04:21.671 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 1>reduction and what are its benefits?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

87
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.440
<v Speaker 1>Let's dive into those right now the </v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms highlights,</v>

88
00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.600
<v Speaker 1>even though there are a lot of changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are really only two main points to</v>

89
00:04:38.601 --> 00:04:40.910
<v Speaker 1>consider here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One is lowering income tax.</v>

90
00:04:40.911 --> 00:04:43.250
<v Speaker 1>That is to see the tax that affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural persons,</v>

91
00:04:43.251 --> 00:04:44.084
<v Speaker 1>just regular man on the streets and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>other is the changes to corporate tax </v>

92
00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:51.530
<v Speaker 1>first case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but natural persons.</v>

93
00:04:51.531 --> 00:04:53.690
<v Speaker 1>This reduction is really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really small.</v>

94
00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.583
<v Speaker 1>C,</v>
<v Speaker 1>80% of taxpayers will see an income tax </v>

95
00:04:56.601 --> 00:05:00.170
<v Speaker 1>change of less than 2% and most won't </v>
<v Speaker 1>even really notice it.</v>

96
00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:03.980
<v Speaker 1>And regarding this matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has blatantly broken his word.</v>

97
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.690
<v Speaker 3>So</v>

98
00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:07.261
<v Speaker 1>why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:05:07.261 --> 00:05:08.094
<v Speaker 1>because Donald Trump promised a new tax </v>
<v Speaker 1>system a much simpler one with only </v>

100
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.300
<v Speaker 1>three or four brackets and much lower,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

101
00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

102
00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 5>we're going to cut the individual rate </v>
<v Speaker 5>from seven brackets</v>

103
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.643
<v Speaker 3>to form.</v>

104
00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:26.533
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have virtually remained the same </v>

105
00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:31.310
<v Speaker 1>with seven brackets kind of rates </v>
<v Speaker 1>slightly lower than before.</v>

106
00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:34.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's not all this reduction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also temporary.</v>

107
00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:35.173
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>

108
00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:36.013
<v Speaker 1>This is going to disappear in 2025 </v>
<v Speaker 1>unless Congress changes what it is </v>

109
00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 1>approved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

110
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:43.733
<v Speaker 1>One very interesting thing about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>law is that it limits deductions for </v>

111
00:05:46.401 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 1>state and local taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

112
00:05:48.501 --> 00:05:52.460
<v Speaker 1>it punishes states with higher taxes and</v>
<v Speaker 1>encourages them to lower them.</v>

113
00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.353
<v Speaker 1>Now on the other hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the reduction of corporate </v>

114
00:05:54.621 --> 00:05:56.450
<v Speaker 1>income tax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is so to speak,</v>

115
00:05:56.451 --> 00:05:57.950
<v Speaker 1>the jewel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reform,</v>

116
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:05.520
<v Speaker 6>yeah.</v>

117
00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.353
<v Speaker 1>The tax decreases from 35% to 21% and it</v>
<v Speaker 1>changes its scoped so that it ceases to </v>

118
00:06:10.771 --> 00:06:13.340
<v Speaker 1>be global and to facts almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>exclusively.</v>

119
00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:14.243
<v Speaker 1>The United States allow me to explain </v>
<v Speaker 1>myself because this is really important </v>

120
00:06:17.611 --> 00:06:18.444
<v Speaker 1>to up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when American multinationals such as </v>

121
00:06:20.011 --> 00:06:23.160
<v Speaker 1>apple or Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>made money abroad as for example they do</v>

122
00:06:23.161 --> 00:06:26.040
<v Speaker 1>in Ireland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite having already paid taxes to the</v>

123
00:06:26.041 --> 00:06:26.874
<v Speaker 1>Irish governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to pay again in the u s for </v>

124
00:06:29.101 --> 00:06:29.934
<v Speaker 1>what they had earned in islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they wanted to bring the money into </v>

125
00:06:32.011 --> 00:06:32.844
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially they were paying twice for </v>

126
00:06:35.161 --> 00:06:36.690
<v Speaker 1>any money they were bringing home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

127
00:06:36.691 --> 00:06:37.524
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these companies weren't really very </v>

128
00:06:38.371 --> 00:06:39.204
<v Speaker 1>willing to do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you could probably guess what </v>

129
00:06:40.651 --> 00:06:42.330
<v Speaker 1>happened next.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well these companies,</v>

130
00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:43.164
<v Speaker 1>they simply didn't repatriate their </v>
<v Speaker 1>income to the United States as the </v>

131
00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.910
<v Speaker 1>cancer didn't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Financial centers like Luxembourg,</v>

132
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:51.210
<v Speaker 1>Ireland or Singapore and the figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're pretty dizzying.</v>

133
00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.140
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about more than two point </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5 trillion here.</v>

134
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:00.200
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that from now on,</v>

135
00:07:00.201 --> 00:07:01.034
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>US multinationals will only pay the u s </v>

136
00:07:03.351 --> 00:07:07.340
<v Speaker 1>treasury for income they make within the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and for the money that's already</v>

137
00:07:07.341 --> 00:07:08.174
<v Speaker 1>outside the new law states that they can</v>
<v Speaker 1>bring it home as a very attractive </v>

138
00:07:11.241 --> 00:07:12.860
<v Speaker 1>conditions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>

139
00:07:12.861 --> 00:07:16.850
<v Speaker 1>I have millions of dollars overseas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I can't bring it back into this gun.</v>

140
00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.953
<v Speaker 1>So indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's highly likely that this year we're </v>

141
00:07:19.251 --> 00:07:20.084
<v Speaker 1>going to begin to see it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Large amounts of money moving towards </v>

142
00:07:22.281 --> 00:07:23.240
<v Speaker 1>the United States</v>

143
00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a side note,</v>

144
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.673
<v Speaker 1>evenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corporate income tax decreased from </v>

145
00:07:31.731 --> 00:07:35.570
<v Speaker 1>35% 21% that isn't actually that big of </v>
<v Speaker 1>a drop.</v>

146
00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:37.610
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while the tax rates do decrease,</v>

147
00:07:37.611 --> 00:07:38.444
<v Speaker 1>some deductions eliminated or limited,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those deductions previously allowed </v>

148
00:07:42.171 --> 00:07:44.990
<v Speaker 1>companies to pay an average of 20% </v>
<v Speaker 1>before the reform.</v>

149
00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:48.140
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand though,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the old US income tax was the highest in</v>

150
00:07:48.141 --> 00:07:48.974
<v Speaker 1>the OEC.</v>
<v Speaker 1>D If we take into account all the taxes </v>

151
00:07:50.781 --> 00:07:51.614
<v Speaker 1>companies pays not only on income.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that although the United </v>

152
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.040
<v Speaker 1>States pays a lot of taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe's are usually even higher.</v>

153
00:07:58.070 --> 00:07:59.690
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones in Spain,</v>

154
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:01.040
<v Speaker 1>France or even Janet.</v>

155
00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:08.890
<v Speaker 1>I would even say even if it isn't as </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive as the republican state,</v>

156
00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.880
<v Speaker 1>it will have positive consequences for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s economy from now on the country.</v>

157
00:08:12.881 --> 00:08:13.714
<v Speaker 1>It will be more attractive to investors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's companies will earn more money and </v>

158
00:08:16.451 --> 00:08:18.640
<v Speaker 1>a lot of income that was previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>retained,</v>

159
00:08:18.641 --> 00:08:19.474
<v Speaker 1>a broad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll begin to move to the United </v>

160
00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:22.113
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so do you use all of this and due to </v>

161
00:08:24.281 --> 00:08:25.114
<v Speaker 1>some other smaller changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just this once and certainly without </v>

162
00:08:28.061 --> 00:08:28.894
<v Speaker 1>setting a precedence here at visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic we can say trump seems to be </v>

163
00:08:31.541 --> 00:08:33.040
<v Speaker 1>doing well in terms of tactics.</v>

164
00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:36.833
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

165
00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.760
<v Speaker 1>If you think that's it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are very,</v>

166
00:08:38.761 --> 00:08:39.594
<v Speaker 1>very wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The reform also certainly has its </v>

167
00:08:41.101 --> 00:08:42.000
<v Speaker 1>negative points.</v>

168
00:08:48.130 --> 00:08:52.290
<v Speaker 3>The shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those</v>

169
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.400
<v Speaker 1>who followed this channel?</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

170
00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:56.760
<v Speaker 1>that we usually say that things aren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>as pretty as they seem.</v>

171
00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:00.090
<v Speaker 1>Well that is precisely the case with </v>
<v Speaker 1>this tax reform law.</v>

172
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:01.043
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the positive effects of this log will </v>

173
00:09:02.551 --> 00:09:06.030
<v Speaker 1>most likely be much more limited than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican party claims.</v>

174
00:09:06.060 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>And why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

175
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:07.824
<v Speaker 1>allow me to</v>

176
00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:09.493
<v Speaker 3>you.</v>

177
00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:10.813
<v Speaker 1>It's economy is growing at a good pace.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is almost full employment and </v>

178
00:09:14.001 --> 00:09:14.834
<v Speaker 1>corporate profits are historically high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say right now American </v>

179
00:09:20.121 --> 00:09:22.310
<v Speaker 1>companies which are already very </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive,</v>

180
00:09:22.340 --> 00:09:23.173
<v Speaker 1>mostly need fewer regulations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to trade freely and the </v>

181
00:09:25.671 --> 00:09:26.504
<v Speaker 1>freedom to hire the workers they need,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the best talents they can get </v>

182
00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:30.523
<v Speaker 1>from abroad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

183
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:35.443
<v Speaker 3>MMM.</v>

184
00:09:36.370 --> 00:09:39.590
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump doesn't exactly play that way.</v>

185
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:42.200
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reform will have positive effects,</v>

186
00:09:42.201 --> 00:09:43.034
<v Speaker 1>but not as many as some people do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think while it is not the largest tax </v>

187
00:09:46.401 --> 00:09:47.234
<v Speaker 1>cut ever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the most poorly timed tax cut in </v>

188
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:49.634
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The economy is near full employment and </v>

189
00:09:51.291 --> 00:09:54.440
<v Speaker 1>the national debt is it postwar record </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rising fast.</v>

190
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:55.453
<v Speaker 1>Leonard Eberman Tax Policy Center,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cofounder and institute fellow at the </v>

191
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:00.141
<v Speaker 1>Urban Institute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

192
00:10:00.141 --> 00:10:02.660
<v Speaker 1>this government isn't talking about </v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing public spending.</v>

193
00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.590
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the contrary,</v>

194
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:06.920
<v Speaker 1>they want to increase public spending on</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure and the military,</v>

195
00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:11.690
<v Speaker 1>and of course with fewer taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means more deficits and more public</v>

196
00:10:11.691 --> 00:10:13.580
<v Speaker 1>debt as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're honest,</v>

197
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:15.980
<v Speaker 1>the U S has quite a track record of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>

198
00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:23.583
<v Speaker 1>And lastly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop deep forgotten party in this </v>

199
00:10:24.971 --> 00:10:26.590
<v Speaker 1>reform is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the middle class.</v>

200
00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:27.453
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ones who will benefit the most from </v>

201
00:10:28.541 --> 00:10:30.850
<v Speaker 1>this reform will be the wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>classes,</v>

202
00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:32.140
<v Speaker 1>including,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

203
00:10:32.230 --> 00:10:33.340
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump himself</v>

204
00:10:33.430 --> 00:10:37.180
<v Speaker 2>in the center of the stage tonight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's this man Donald Trump.</v>

205
00:10:40.390 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Am I allowed to accept it?</v>

206
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:47.720
<v Speaker 2>Had Rich Friends of mine come up to me </v>
<v Speaker 2>and say,</v>

207
00:10:47.721 --> 00:10:49.880
<v Speaker 2>Donald,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're doing this tax plan.</v>

208
00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.290
<v Speaker 2>We don't want anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't</v>

209
00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:58.170
<v Speaker 1>president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider that he and his companies would</v>

210
00:10:58.171 --> 00:11:00.510
<v Speaker 1>benefit so well from this reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

211
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:02.460
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to leave that for you too.</v>

212
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:04.770
<v Speaker 3>Sit Up.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The Republican Party</v>

213
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:05.603
<v Speaker 1>has betrayed working families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This tax scam takes billions of dollars </v>

214
00:11:08.431 --> 00:11:11.760
<v Speaker 1>away from the middleclass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>enhance it over to Republican donors and</v>

215
00:11:11.761 --> 00:11:15.540
<v Speaker 1>wealthy corporations while mortgaging </v>
<v Speaker 1>away the future of our economy by adding</v>

216
00:11:15.541 --> 00:11:18.180
<v Speaker 1>one point $5 trillion in debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tom Perez,</v>

217
00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:20.190
<v Speaker 1>chairman of the Democratic National </v>
<v Speaker 1>Committee.</v>

218
00:11:20.220 --> 00:11:21.053
<v Speaker 1>Maybe this is why Paul stayed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that most Americans do not really like </v>

219
00:11:23.761 --> 00:11:24.594
<v Speaker 1>this change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The general perception that seems to be </v>

220
00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:29.370
<v Speaker 1>that this reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was made by and forth the richest.</v>

221
00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:31.190
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike what we might expect,</v>

222
00:11:31.210 --> 00:11:32.043
<v Speaker 1>many Democratic Party leaders are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rubbing their hands together and </v>

223
00:11:34.141 --> 00:11:36.810
<v Speaker 1>thinking that this may favor them in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>mid term elections,</v>

224
00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:39.990
<v Speaker 1>which will be held in November.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only time it's going to tell.</v>

225
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.883
<v Speaker 1>But what we think is that this reform </v>
<v Speaker 1>will make us companies more attractive </v>

226
00:11:43.591 --> 00:11:45.990
<v Speaker 1>and that's in principle is a very good </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

227
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.250
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as things are,</v>

228
00:11:47.251 --> 00:11:50.820
<v Speaker 1>the US needs many more measures which </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump has ruled out.</v>

229
00:11:50.850 --> 00:11:51.683
<v Speaker 1>But on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there may be time for the United States </v>

230
00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.190
<v Speaker 1>to begin taking their public debts </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying growth much more seriously.</v>

231
00:11:57.210 --> 00:11:59.000
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just as a final note yet,</v>

232
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.170
<v Speaker 1>with this reform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all kind of win in away.</v>

233
00:12:01.200 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the United States reduces its taxes,</v>

234
00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:04.653
<v Speaker 1>it's also been shown historically that </v>
<v Speaker 1>other governments will be unwilling to </v>

235
00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:08.000
<v Speaker 1>raise.</v>

236
00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.833
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

237
