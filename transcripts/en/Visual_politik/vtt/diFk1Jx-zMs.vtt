1
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.530
<v Speaker 1>Here's the question sheet and Google the</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

2
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 1>Imagine that you have to buy a house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where would be cheaper?</v>

3
00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:14.623
<v Speaker 1>Barcelona or Miami if you need a clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let me tell you that both cities have </v>

4
00:00:18.471 --> 00:00:21.890
<v Speaker 1>more or less the same population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we consider the metropolitan area,</v>

5
00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.650
<v Speaker 1>both cities have beaches and to very </v>
<v Speaker 1>touristy.</v>

6
00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:28.813
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average salary in Miami is almost </v>

7
00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.640
<v Speaker 1>twice the one in Barcelona and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment rate is much,</v>

8
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.010
<v Speaker 1>much lower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having said all of that many,</v>

9
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.030
<v Speaker 1>many things that my logic Barcelona </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be cheaper than Miami.</v>

10
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're thinking that you're actually </v>

11
00:00:43.461 --> 00:00:44.294
<v Speaker 1>wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heightens in Miami are 15 percent </v>

12
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:46.634
<v Speaker 1>cheaper than those in Barcelona.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you were buying a house in Spain is </v>

13
00:00:50.571 --> 00:00:51.404
<v Speaker 1>truly an impossible mission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I know what you may be thinking </v>

14
00:00:53.121 --> 00:00:54.350
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Houses.</v>

15
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.300
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're expensive everywhere,</v>

16
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.590
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

17
00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.120
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are actually right.</v>

18
00:00:59.121 --> 00:00:59.954
<v Speaker 1>House prices are rising in almost every </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and this is especially </v>

19
00:01:02.691 --> 00:01:06.340
<v Speaker 1>surprising if we consider that the trend</v>
<v Speaker 1>is quite the opposite for other good.</v>

20
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:12.230
<v Speaker 1>We've said it already on this channel </v>
<v Speaker 1>like a thousand times.</v>

21
00:01:12.231 --> 00:01:13.064
<v Speaker 1>Humanity is just doing better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've practically eradicated </v>

22
00:01:15.861 --> 00:01:16.694
<v Speaker 1>malnutrition old around the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our standard of living is much higher </v>

23
00:01:19.551 --> 00:01:20.384
<v Speaker 1>than that of our grandparents and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>is pretty much do among other things to </v>

24
00:01:23.811 --> 00:01:26.750
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the products we consume,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're getting cheaper.</v>

25
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.150
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just 30 years ago,</v>

26
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.013
<v Speaker 1>our parents would have to save an </v>
<v Speaker 1>average month salary to fly from London </v>

27
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:37.960
<v Speaker 1>to Berlin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>

28
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 1>that's just history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's housing is the only elements that</v>

29
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:43.430
<v Speaker 1>hasn't become more accessible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>

30
00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:47.110
<v Speaker 1>It's becoming almost prohibitively </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive in many parts of the world.</v>

31
00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.120
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to focus on Spain,</v>

32
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.063
<v Speaker 1>but many of the things we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>review because happen in almost any </v>

33
00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.243
<v Speaker 1>country because the question that we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking ourselves today is why is it so </v>

34
00:01:57.791 --> 00:02:01.630
<v Speaker 1>damn expensive to buy a house and can we</v>
<v Speaker 1>do anything to solve this?</v>

35
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are going to answer these questions </v>

36
00:02:03.791 --> 00:02:05.980
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first let's dive into the history</v>

37
00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:09.783
<v Speaker 1>law of the land.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once the first and most important thing </v>

38
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.270
<v Speaker 1>we need to build a house,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

39
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.210
<v Speaker 1>that would of course be the lambs that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were going to build it on rice.</v>

40
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.620
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that aspect,</v>

41
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.470
<v Speaker 1>Spain has the perfect geography.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a huge,</v>

42
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.330
<v Speaker 1>relatively flat country with many </v>
<v Speaker 1>unpopulated areas.</v>

43
00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.740
<v Speaker 1>Are the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

44
00:02:27.741 --> 00:02:28.574
<v Speaker 1>the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you have the very real problem that </v>

45
00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.590
<v Speaker 1>they high population density?</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

46
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.830
<v Speaker 1>Spain has plenty of space for all of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

47
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.930
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having a</v>

48
00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.260
<v Speaker 1>piece of land doesn't necessarily mean </v>
<v Speaker 1>we can use it to build houses.</v>

49
00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:45.243
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2011 40 percent of the land in the </v>

50
00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:50.500
<v Speaker 1>capital,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Madrid was considered not urbanized.</v>

51
00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.420
<v Speaker 1>This means that the city council limits </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction in these territories.</v>

52
00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:56.463
<v Speaker 1>In other cities such as Malaga,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this percentage even rises to more than </v>

53
00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>70</v>

54
00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.870
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You might be wondering,</v>

55
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>why all of a sudden many lands where you</v>

56
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:09.100
<v Speaker 3>can't build up the onset of this lies in</v>
<v Speaker 3>municipal services.</v>

57
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.710
<v Speaker 3>You see when you build in a residential </v>
<v Speaker 3>area,</v>

58
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 3>you need sewers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>electricity,</v>

59
00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.194
<v Speaker 3>new bus lines,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and of course things like garbage </v>

60
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.500
<v Speaker 3>collection and say,</v>
<v Speaker 3>well,</v>

61
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.480
<v Speaker 3>who's responsible for all of these </v>
<v Speaker 3>costs?</v>

62
00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.540
<v Speaker 3>The city councils,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that is every.</v>

63
00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.813
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

64
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.603
<v Speaker 3>If a construction company proposes a </v>
<v Speaker 3>housing development on the outskirts of </v>

65
00:03:30.851 --> 00:03:32.890
<v Speaker 3>Madrid,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it doesn't manage to sell them all.</v>

66
00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:36.430
<v Speaker 3>Every local will have to pay for a ghost</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas.</v>

67
00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.390
<v Speaker 3>Urban services</v>

68
00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:38.423
<v Speaker 1>due to all of this town councils have </v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to control every single detail </v>

69
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.450
<v Speaker 1>of where and how that municipality you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can extend in Spain.</v>

70
00:03:45.451 --> 00:03:49.500
<v Speaker 1>This is done through a legal instruments</v>
<v Speaker 1>known as the urban ordination plans.</v>

71
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:50.393
<v Speaker 1>These are maps that every city will </v>
<v Speaker 1>publishes every 10 years specifying the </v>

72
00:03:53.731 --> 00:03:56.790
<v Speaker 1>areas in which someone can build,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because hold on a second,</v>

73
00:03:56.791 --> 00:03:59.250
<v Speaker 1>maybe you're Spanish and you're watching</v>
<v Speaker 1>this video from Spain.</v>

74
00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Now I know what you might be thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't land supposed to be liberalized in</v>

75
00:04:03.331 --> 00:04:08.331
<v Speaker 1>Spain in 1997,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jose,</v>

76
00:04:08.681 --> 00:04:09.514
<v Speaker 1>Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Sonos governments put out a law </v>

77
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.990
<v Speaker 1>that's involved in theory land </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalization.</v>

78
00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:18.880
<v Speaker 1>This means that in theory all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries lands became developable.</v>

79
00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:21.880
<v Speaker 1>That is essentially it is suitable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>

80
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:26.440
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly every Spanish city group and </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of residential areas emerged.</v>

81
00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.920
<v Speaker 1>This was the beginning of the housing </v>
<v Speaker 1>bubble butts.</v>

82
00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:35.010
<v Speaker 1>As we've mentioned many times the devil </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the details take.</v>

83
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:38.783
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we said that the urban ordination plans </v>

84
00:04:40.021 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>determine the areas one can build on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not the entire picture hat.</v>

85
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:47.100
<v Speaker 1>It also sets the conditions for </v>
<v Speaker 1>building.</v>

86
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:48.083
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine we're requesting a permit from </v>

87
00:04:49.681 --> 00:04:54.030
<v Speaker 1>the Barcelona City Council to build a </v>
<v Speaker 1>block of flats on a plot that we own.</v>

88
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city council will say absolutely no </v>

89
00:04:56.191 --> 00:04:59.790
<v Speaker 1>problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can only build 20 homes or 15 or</v>

90
00:04:59.791 --> 00:05:00.390
<v Speaker 1>maybe even just</v>

91
00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:01.223
<v Speaker 4>10.</v>

92
00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 1>They need to see the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if construction is allowed,</v>

93
00:05:05.951 --> 00:05:08.140
<v Speaker 1>housing supply is still highly</v>

94
00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.073
<v Speaker 3>restricted and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this also explains many of Spain's </v>

95
00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:13.393
<v Speaker 3>corruption cases.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Most of the scandals that have been </v>

96
00:05:15.171 --> 00:05:18.380
<v Speaker 3>discovered in recent years were revealed</v>
<v Speaker 3>because developer,</v>

97
00:05:18.381 --> 00:05:19.214
<v Speaker 3>it was bing a town planning a council so</v>
<v Speaker 3>that instead of getting a permit for 10 </v>

98
00:05:23.151 --> 00:05:25.700
<v Speaker 3>houses,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they'd get one for twice as many.</v>

99
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.310
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the construction sector has a larger and</v>

100
00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:30.173
<v Speaker 1>more perverse incentive to essentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>invest in bribes than any other sex at </v>

101
00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:39.050
<v Speaker 1>like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>incurred in the 20th century.</v>

102
00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:47.630
<v Speaker 1>Can you guess the least productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector of the economy,</v>

103
00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:50.960
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine it is indeed </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction.</v>

104
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.300
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a world where it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>all just.</v>

105
00:05:53.301 --> 00:05:56.090
<v Speaker 1>You find a project actually being built </v>
<v Speaker 1>by its due date,</v>

106
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>and this isn't just limited to Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give you an idea.</v>

107
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>The new apple offices in Silicon Valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were completed two years later than</v>

108
00:06:04.641 --> 00:06:09.641
<v Speaker 1>expected and has an extra cost of </v>
<v Speaker 1>$2,000,000,000 and the same happens with</v>

109
00:06:10.131 --> 00:06:12.030
<v Speaker 1>almost every house built,</v>

110
00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:12.963
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

111
00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:15.713
<v Speaker 3>One survey of British architects found </v>
<v Speaker 3>that 60 percent of their buildings were </v>

112
00:06:19.201 --> 00:06:19.870
<v Speaker 3>late</v>

113
00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.850
<v Speaker 1>and so well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>

114
00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:25.630
<v Speaker 1>well pointed these things out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as whole the answer essentially lies</v>

115
00:06:25.660 --> 00:06:27.820
<v Speaker 1>in a lack of innovation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

116
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.743
<v Speaker 1>houses today a much more modern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have better insulation that a </v>

117
00:06:31.541 --> 00:06:32.374
<v Speaker 1>heating systems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the way in which they're built is </v>

118
00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.300
<v Speaker 1>pretty much the same as it was 50 years </v>
<v Speaker 1>ago.</v>

119
00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:40.630
<v Speaker 1>Any economic sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's just much more advanced.</v>

120
00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:42.850
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a car factory 60 years ago,</v>

121
00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.340
<v Speaker 1>it looks nothing like a car factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

122
00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:48.040
<v Speaker 1>Most of the jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our grandparents health have simply been</v>

123
00:06:48.041 --> 00:06:51.730
<v Speaker 1>replaced by computer programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines and robots.</v>

124
00:06:51.980 --> 00:06:53.200
<v Speaker 1>What's the results of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:06:53.230 --> 00:06:54.063
<v Speaker 1>nowadays a call has many more features </v>
<v Speaker 1>and is cheaper to make than it was 60 </v>

126
00:06:57.491 --> 00:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to that.</v>

127
00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.930
<v Speaker 1>Now almost every family can afford one </v>
<v Speaker 1>or even two.</v>

128
00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:06.613
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we saw a construction project from </v>

129
00:07:07.971 --> 00:07:12.710
<v Speaker 1>the 19 sixties with barely notice any </v>
<v Speaker 1>difference with one done today at all,</v>

130
00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:14.500
<v Speaker 1>same builders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>same grains,</v>

131
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean construction companies have </v>
<v Speaker 1>barely invested at all in innovation and</v>

132
00:07:17.991 --> 00:07:19.400
<v Speaker 1>it's understandable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we take,</v>

133
00:07:19.401 --> 00:07:22.250
<v Speaker 1>they're extremely low profit margins </v>
<v Speaker 1>into accounts.</v>

134
00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:22.880
<v Speaker 1>You</v>

135
00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:24.020
<v Speaker 3>heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

136
00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.660
<v Speaker 3>Housing developer can expect a profit </v>
<v Speaker 3>margin of two to five percent.</v>

137
00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:30.523
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>if we're talking about millions of </v>

138
00:07:31.551 --> 00:07:32.384
<v Speaker 3>euros,</v>
<v Speaker 3>two percent is more than enough to make </v>

139
00:07:33.921 --> 00:07:35.390
<v Speaker 3>the company's owner rich.</v>

140
00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:40.060
<v Speaker 5>You gotta hit that,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ya know,</v>

141
00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:49.450
<v Speaker 3>barely allows them to reinvest in other </v>
<v Speaker 3>things such as research and development.</v>

142
00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:53.140
<v Speaker 3>And if this weren't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 3>there are very few incentives to replace</v>

143
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:54.220
<v Speaker 3>workers in machines</v>

144
00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:58.400
<v Speaker 1>and if this was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are very few incentives to replace</v>

145
00:07:58.401 --> 00:08:01.220
<v Speaker 1>workers with machines here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other economic sectors,</v>

146
00:08:01.221 --> 00:08:04.540
<v Speaker 1>working in construction requires initial</v>
<v Speaker 1>training as well.</v>

147
00:08:04.550 --> 00:08:07.790
<v Speaker 1>This leads to a greater concentration of</v>
<v Speaker 1>low skills.</v>

148
00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:13.813
<v Speaker 1>We can summarize everything like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a restricted land supply which </v>

149
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:18.314
<v Speaker 1>makes property prices rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then there's a long and expensive </v>

150
00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:24.800
<v Speaker 1>and unpredictable construction process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

151
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:25.693
<v Speaker 1>what's the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both homes in Spain have become </v>

152
00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.050
<v Speaker 1>prohibitively expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

153
00:08:30.110 --> 00:08:33.260
<v Speaker 1>almost 80 percent of Spaniards,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've managed to own their own home.</v>

154
00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.390
<v Speaker 1>So the question is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:08:35.630 --> 00:08:37.370
<v Speaker 1>how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

156
00:08:37.371 --> 00:08:42.371
<v Speaker 1>let's dive into that money for everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a basic principle in economics.</v>

157
00:08:46.351 --> 00:08:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Things all worth what someone is willing</v>
<v Speaker 1>to pay for them.</v>

158
00:08:49.710 --> 00:08:50.543
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a foreign flat in a normal </v>

159
00:08:51.871 --> 00:08:54.900
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood of Madrid is worth more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 300,000 years,</v>

160
00:08:55.050 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 1>it's because someone can afford to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 300,000 euros.</v>

161
00:08:58.550 --> 00:09:02.790
<v Speaker 1>That how can there be so many people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>can pay so much?</v>

162
00:09:02.791 --> 00:09:03.624
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't Spain's supposed to be in a </v>

163
00:09:04.591 --> 00:09:07.290
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't we say that the average salary in</v>

164
00:09:07.291 --> 00:09:09.900
<v Speaker 1>Spain is less than 2000 euros a month?</v>

165
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.450
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

166
00:09:13.660 --> 00:09:14.790
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>

167
00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:15.933
<v Speaker 1>the answer lies of course in the banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>300,000 euros is a true fortune for </v>

168
00:09:21.431 --> 00:09:23.530
<v Speaker 1>someone earning an average salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bart,</v>

169
00:09:23.531 --> 00:09:27.430
<v Speaker 1>if one pays all that money in </v>
<v Speaker 1>comfortable installments over many,</v>

170
00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:29.980
<v Speaker 1>many years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'd be a bit easier.</v>

171
00:09:30.070 --> 00:09:32.010
<v Speaker 1>And so how many years do you think we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about here?</v>

172
00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.220
<v Speaker 1>Ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years?</v>

173
00:09:33.340 --> 00:09:34.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that we're talking about a </v>

174
00:09:36.041 --> 00:09:37.660
<v Speaker 1>lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lot longer,</v>

175
00:09:40.350 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 3>40 year mortgages in exclusive and </v>
<v Speaker 3>conditional product for young people.</v>

176
00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.953
<v Speaker 1>Forty years is an incredible amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>time and it's really not uncommon in </v>

177
00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:49.464
<v Speaker 1>Spain to find people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have these 40 year mortgages and </v>

178
00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:55.260
<v Speaker 1>some may say to all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's really the sense in that?</v>

179
00:09:55.350 --> 00:09:57.430
<v Speaker 1>Imagine you're a bank and you grounds a </v>
<v Speaker 1>couple,</v>

180
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.283
<v Speaker 1>a 40 year loan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a thousand different things can happen </v>

181
00:10:00.541 --> 00:10:01.374
<v Speaker 1>in four decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means they might not be able to </v>

182
00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:03.723
<v Speaker 1>return the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So where's the business for the bank </v>

183
00:10:05.521 --> 00:10:06.354
<v Speaker 1>here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How can the bank risk so much when </v>

184
00:10:08.431 --> 00:10:09.480
<v Speaker 1>grunting alone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

185
00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:12.420
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to that is in the central</v>

186
00:10:12.610 --> 00:10:15.610
<v Speaker 2>thank you.</v>

187
00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:20.970
<v Speaker 3>Be to keep printing billions of euros to</v>
<v Speaker 3>prop up the eurozone until 2019.</v>

188
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.750
<v Speaker 3>You really did hear that Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Nowadays,</v>

189
00:10:23.751 --> 00:10:25.670
<v Speaker 3>Europe is producing more money</v>

190
00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 1>than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

191
00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:29.610
<v Speaker 1>Europe does have a relatively low </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>

192
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:30.473
<v Speaker 2>Great.</v>

193
00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:34.453
<v Speaker 1>In another visual politic video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we did explain that when central banks </v>

194
00:10:36.801 --> 00:10:39.140
<v Speaker 1>print bills prices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they tend to go up.</v>

195
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:42.380
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Europe the opposite happens so well,</v>

196
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:43.400
<v Speaker 1>why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

197
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:44.234
<v Speaker 1>that's because all of that newly printed</v>
<v Speaker 1>money that goes directly to the banks </v>

198
00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.450
<v Speaker 1>and the banks he was at for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

199
00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:51.640
<v Speaker 1>of course that was the loan.</v>

200
00:10:54.970 --> 00:10:58.030
<v Speaker 3>That explains why even with relatively </v>
<v Speaker 3>low salaries,</v>

201
00:10:58.090 --> 00:11:03.070
<v Speaker 3>most Spaniards are willing to pay real </v>
<v Speaker 3>fortunes to own a house and what's worse</v>

202
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:03.933
<v Speaker 3>prices continue to rise unabated.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It will always be someone willing to </v>

203
00:11:07.571 --> 00:11:10.270
<v Speaker 3>originate or take out a 40 year </v>
<v Speaker 3>mortgage.</v>

204
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:11.223
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the factors point to the fact that </v>

205
00:11:12.661 --> 00:11:13.494
<v Speaker 1>this in the long term housing will </v>
<v Speaker 1>become more and more expensive and that </v>

206
00:11:16.451 --> 00:11:18.790
<v Speaker 1>explains things like this.</v>

207
00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:21.920
<v Speaker 2>Housing profitability</v>

208
00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:23.680
<v Speaker 3>rises as an investment.</v>

209
00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.320
<v Speaker 1>This means that along with the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who buy an apartment to live in is there</v>

210
00:11:28.321 --> 00:11:29.154
<v Speaker 1>are people who buy them as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments and other words central </v>

211
00:11:31.771 --> 00:11:32.604
<v Speaker 1>banks inflate to hens.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Municipalities restrict supply </v>

212
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:40.790
<v Speaker 1>conclusion of all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Houses are becoming more expensive every</v>

213
00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.633
<v Speaker 1>single day and at this point I just want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to take the time to thank Miguel and </v>

214
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.854
<v Speaker 1>health on seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>architectural studies for helping us </v>

215
00:11:45.181 --> 00:11:46.014
<v Speaker 1>understand all the details of the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>of construction in and planning in </v>

216
00:11:48.571 --> 00:11:49.404
<v Speaker 1>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Gal and how Fonseca is one of the </v>

217
00:11:50.941 --> 00:11:53.560
<v Speaker 1>greatest experts of sustainable </v>
<v Speaker 1>architecture in Spain.</v>

00:12:01.610 --> 00:12:02.443
<v Speaker 1>and well now it's time to turn to you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you think this problem should be </v>

220
00:12:06.381 --> 00:12:07.214
<v Speaker 1>solved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think we should restrict bank </v>

221
00:12:08.301 --> 00:12:10.490
<v Speaker 1>mortgages?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about released the land in order to</v>

222
00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:14.000
<v Speaker 1>be able to build more?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What kind of policies do you think would</v>

223
00:12:14.001 --> 00:12:14.990
<v Speaker 1>solve this problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
