<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.063
<v Speaker 2>often people think that Switzerland's </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealth comes only because of their </v>

3
00:00:10.291 --> 00:00:13.320
<v Speaker 2>status as a fiscal haven.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But think about it.</v>

4
00:00:13.321 --> 00:00:15.420
<v Speaker 2>There are other countries like Panama,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cypress,</v>

5
00:00:15.421 --> 00:00:19.320
<v Speaker 2>the Republic of Liberia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these all fiscal haven's too,</v>

6
00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.250
<v Speaker 2>don't forget Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not 70 offers low taxes to international</v>

7
00:00:23.251 --> 00:00:24.084
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also offers them Pasadena </v>

8
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.540
<v Speaker 2>passage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's still,</v>

9
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 2>these countries remained low income </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

10
00:00:28.651 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 2>While Switzerland's remains one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>wealthiest countries in the world,</v>

11
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.860
<v Speaker 2>and all of this comes with them having </v>
<v Speaker 2>no natural resources not compromising on</v>

12
00:00:37.861 --> 00:00:39.450
<v Speaker 2>democracy or human rights.</v>

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.700
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

14
00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.713
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland has one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>egalitarian political systems in the </v>

15
00:00:46.451 --> 00:00:47.284
<v Speaker 2>world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and its welfare system is as good as </v>

16
00:00:48.821 --> 00:00:50.560
<v Speaker 2>that of Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Denmark.</v>

17
00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:52.090
<v Speaker 2>Additionally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their citizens,</v>

18
00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:54.730
<v Speaker 2>and not only have the right to vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>every four years,</v>

19
00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.100
<v Speaker 2>but every four months,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was,</v>

20
00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.963
<v Speaker 2>don't just choose their leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that they choose their policies with </v>

21
00:01:00.011 --> 00:01:02.680
<v Speaker 2>referendums happening several times a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year,</v>

22
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:05.560
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland has one of the world's best </v>
<v Speaker 2>political systems,</v>

23
00:01:05.561 --> 00:01:09.160
<v Speaker 2>and we believe that this is the reason </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they are successful.</v>

24
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.530
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we think that the Swiss system should be</v>

25
00:01:11.531 --> 00:01:12.364
<v Speaker 2>a model for other countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in this video we're going to tell </v>

26
00:01:14.231 --> 00:01:15.064
<v Speaker 2>you why.</v>

27
00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.540
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

28
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:19.543
<v Speaker 2>reason number one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the centralization from a practical </v>

29
00:01:23.091 --> 00:01:23.924
<v Speaker 2>point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's Switzerland is what is known as a </v>

30
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:27.290
<v Speaker 2>confederation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

31
00:01:27.291 --> 00:01:30.230
<v Speaker 2>it's the only confederation that exists </v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet.</v>

32
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.100
<v Speaker 2>It is made up of 26 states which are </v>
<v Speaker 2>cold cantons.</v>

33
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.083
<v Speaker 2>The only thing that these cans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all those have in common are a </v>

34
00:01:36.711 --> 00:01:39.590
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>foreign policy and the currency.</v>

35
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:40.573
<v Speaker 2>Aside from that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if they are totally different from one </v>

36
00:01:42.501 --> 00:01:44.210
<v Speaker 2>another,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's look at an example.</v>

37
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's say you make a salary of 6,000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swiss franc spend.</v>

38
00:01:48.171 --> 00:01:50.030
<v Speaker 2>You live in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the Jura.</v>

39
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.073
<v Speaker 2>In that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're going to pay income tax of 14% </v>

40
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.853
<v Speaker 2>but if you made the same amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 2>money and you live in the region of </v>

41
00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:57.683
<v Speaker 2>Zuellig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your income tax is only going to be 4% </v>

42
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.430
<v Speaker 2>look at a different example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you have a shop in Geneva,</v>

43
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 2>then you're going to have to close your </v>
<v Speaker 2>shop at 6:00 PM but if you own a shop in</v>

44
00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:13.064
<v Speaker 2>Zurich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're free to keep your shop open for </v>

45
00:02:14.361 --> 00:02:15.194
<v Speaker 2>as many hours as you want.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because of this system that comes on is </v>

46
00:02:17.991 --> 00:02:18.824
<v Speaker 2>can adjust the laws,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the peculiarities of each individual </v>

47
00:02:21.621 --> 00:02:22.454
<v Speaker 2>territory ans what is even more </v>
<v Speaker 2>important than this is that they can </v>

48
00:02:26.781 --> 00:02:27.890
<v Speaker 2>compete with each other.</v>

49
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.950
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

50
00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.100
<v Speaker 2>explains why in general,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the councils have assumption,</v>

51
00:02:35.101 --> 00:02:39.420
<v Speaker 2>no taxation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but our story doesn't end here.</v>

52
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.190
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland is so decentralized that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have four official languages,</v>

53
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.240
<v Speaker 2>German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French,</v>

54
00:02:45.241 --> 00:02:46.680
<v Speaker 2>Italian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and relaunch.</v>

55
00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.750
<v Speaker 2>This means that if you happen to go to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Geneva,</v>

56
00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:49.584
<v Speaker 2>which is a French speaking part,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you're not getting to hear anyone </v>

57
00:02:52.021 --> 00:02:53.850
<v Speaker 2>speaking German,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the billboards,</v>

58
00:02:53.851 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>the road signs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the local newspapers,</v>

59
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.603
<v Speaker 2>everything is in French.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for Zurich with Jen and </v>

60
00:02:59.831 --> 00:03:01.360
<v Speaker 2>all the Ghana with Italian</v>

61
00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.450
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

62
00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.190
<v Speaker 2>Number two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland has no precedent.</v>

63
00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.940
<v Speaker 2>Every country has a head of governments </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is responsible for certain things,</v>

64
00:03:12.941 --> 00:03:14.080
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

65
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:15.420
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not switzer matters,</v>

66
00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:16.263
<v Speaker 2>but don't get me wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're not living in anarchy or </v>

67
00:03:17.831 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 2>anything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is what they do.</v>

68
00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.853
<v Speaker 2>Is they vote for a federal parliaments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is similar to Congress in the </v>

69
00:03:23.831 --> 00:03:24.664
<v Speaker 2>United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This parliaments and then chooses seven </v>

70
00:03:27.491 --> 00:03:31.030
<v Speaker 2>people who are going to become something</v>
<v Speaker 2>like ministers or secretaries.</v>

71
00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.380
<v Speaker 2>All of these people have the same amount</v>
<v Speaker 2>of</v>

72
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.363
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>

73
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them takes a turn becoming </v>

74
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:42.980
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland's international </v>
<v Speaker 2>representative.</v>

75
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.430
<v Speaker 2>It's technically this person is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>president of Switzerland,</v>

76
00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.830
<v Speaker 2>but they haven't no specific powers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Uber,</v>

77
00:03:48.831 --> 00:03:52.550
<v Speaker 2>the other six people and as I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they routine this person.</v>

78
00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:53.693
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an important difference in the </v>

79
00:03:55.581 --> 00:03:56.414
<v Speaker 2>Swiss mentality because in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries the president isn't really </v>

80
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.420
<v Speaker 2>powerful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Passive bought in Switzerland.</v>

81
00:04:01.421 --> 00:04:05.980
<v Speaker 2>It's just a symbolic thing because all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the decision making is done by a team</v>

82
00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

83
00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:13.730
<v Speaker 2>or three direct democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the most important part of Swiss</v>

84
00:04:13.731 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 2>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're referendums.</v>

85
00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:17.053
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of it,</v>

86
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.520
<v Speaker 2>that law was a chosen by a popular vote.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some at the federal level,</v>

87
00:04:20.521 --> 00:04:21.354
<v Speaker 2>some of the canned tonia level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The proposal for a referendum only </v>

88
00:04:23.761 --> 00:04:24.594
<v Speaker 2>requires 50,000 signatures.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While one if it's going to amend the </v>

89
00:04:27.301 --> 00:04:30.510
<v Speaker 2>constitution requires 100 thousands now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't get me wrong.</v>

90
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:33.810
<v Speaker 2>Other countries do allow their </v>
<v Speaker 2>populations to have referendums.</v>

91
00:04:33.811 --> 00:04:34.980
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Spain,</v>

92
00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.843
<v Speaker 2>this is totally possible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but a referendum proposal requires </v>

93
00:04:38.131 --> 00:04:42.850
<v Speaker 2>500,000 signatures and they can't do any</v>
<v Speaker 2>referendums that will change the culture</v>

94
00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.830
<v Speaker 1>tuition because of this</v>

95
00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:46.773
<v Speaker 2>system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland's holds several referendums </v>

96
00:04:48.701 --> 00:04:49.534
<v Speaker 2>every single year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>every four months this waste go to the </v>

97
00:04:51.731 --> 00:04:55.450
<v Speaker 2>polling station and they will vote on </v>
<v Speaker 2>any proposals that have been put forward</v>

98
00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 2>in the previous four months.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

99
00:04:57.611 --> 00:04:58.444
<v Speaker 2>let's look at an example of one of these</v>
<v Speaker 2>referendums from the year 2015 if they </v>

100
00:05:02.501 --> 00:05:03.334
<v Speaker 2>have to choose whether they wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>create a basic income for every Swiss </v>

101
00:05:06.071 --> 00:05:07.390
<v Speaker 2>citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They said no.</v>

102
00:05:07.391 --> 00:05:08.224
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also had to decide on some </v>

103
00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 2>amendments to the assisted reproduction </v>
<v Speaker 2>acts and they also about to vote on some</v>

104
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.360
<v Speaker 2>doors related to public transport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>

105
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:16.820
<v Speaker 2>these,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

106
00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.920
<v Speaker 2>Paul's awesome having really big </v>
<v Speaker 2>turnout.</v>

107
00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.990
<v Speaker 2>60% of Swiss people for this 2015 </v>
<v Speaker 2>referendum when to the polls</v>

108
00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.710
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] some number</v>

109
00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:28.543
<v Speaker 2>for free markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some of you might think that it's very </v>

110
00:05:30.651 --> 00:05:35.600
<v Speaker 2>easy for a populist anticapitalist </v>
<v Speaker 2>leader to emerge in a system like this,</v>

111
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:36.523
<v Speaker 2>but make no mistake Switzerland is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the free markets like France is to it's </v>

112
00:05:41.301 --> 00:05:42.560
<v Speaker 2>wine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget,</v>

113
00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:46.250
<v Speaker 2>this country is isolated in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>mountains and has practically no farming</v>

114
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:48.530
<v Speaker 2>land.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that it's have to sign a free</v>

115
00:05:48.531 --> 00:05:51.390
<v Speaker 2>trade agreements with pretty much every </v>
<v Speaker 2>country on it.</v>

116
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's hold on my deal.</v>

117
00:05:53.181 --> 00:05:55.540
<v Speaker 2>Libertarian friends who are watching </v>
<v Speaker 2>this video,</v>

118
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.550
<v Speaker 2>hold on for just second.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

119
00:05:58.551 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 2>it is true that Switzerland is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>commerce loving nation.</v>

120
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:05.160
<v Speaker 2>No more so than the European Union.</v>

121
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.790
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

122
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.303
<v Speaker 2>This is the Swiss actually subsidize </v>
<v Speaker 2>that agriculture as much as the </v>

123
00:06:11.921 --> 00:06:12.754
<v Speaker 2>Europeans or the Americans do and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>also participate in the same trade </v>

124
00:06:16.091 --> 00:06:18.640
<v Speaker 2>embargoes that exist with Iran and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russia.</v>

125
00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:23.680
<v Speaker 2>The only differences that Switzerland </v>
<v Speaker 2>has embraced free trade since 1874 while</v>

126
00:06:23.681 --> 00:06:24.514
<v Speaker 2>the rest of the world's is only been </v>
<v Speaker 2>doing it for the last few decades and </v>

127
00:06:27.251 --> 00:06:29.830
<v Speaker 2>now there is another very important </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference about Switzerland,</v>

128
00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:30.743
<v Speaker 2>but we must get into,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's probably one that you've heard </v>

129
00:06:33.401 --> 00:06:38.401
<v Speaker 2>about recent number five Swiss,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no tragedy.</v>

130
00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:43.500
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland is one of the few neutral </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in the world.</v>

131
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:47.040
<v Speaker 2>This means that they won't participate </v>
<v Speaker 2>in any arms conflict.</v>

132
00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:47.933
<v Speaker 2>They even stayed out of world water you </v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact that most of the </v>

133
00:06:50.341 --> 00:06:52.830
<v Speaker 2>population was against Hitler.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to this,</v>

134
00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:53.723
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland has never been reconstructed</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the rest of Europe ripped itself </v>

135
00:06:57.061 --> 00:06:57.894
<v Speaker 2>apart,</v>
<v Speaker 2>killing millions and then spending </v>

136
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:00.084
<v Speaker 2>billions in reconstruction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland didn't and they used all of </v>

137
00:07:03.901 --> 00:07:07.770
<v Speaker 2>those savings to improve that system.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we all know,</v>

138
00:07:07.771 --> 00:07:10.990
<v Speaker 2>the number one enemy of economic </v>
<v Speaker 2>progress is</v>

139
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.483
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland does have a military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The thing is this army is entirely </v>

140
00:07:19.731 --> 00:07:23.420
<v Speaker 2>defensive and they will only use it to </v>
<v Speaker 2>propel external attacks.</v>

141
00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:27.470
<v Speaker 2>They will never use it to find it in </v>
<v Speaker 2>anything outside of self defense,</v>

142
00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:31.070
<v Speaker 2>and this is where we see one of the few </v>
<v Speaker 2>drawbacks of the Swiss system.</v>

143
00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:32.233
<v Speaker 2>They're military or should we say them </v>
<v Speaker 2>initia every Swiss citizen must do </v>

144
00:07:35.991 --> 00:07:36.824
<v Speaker 2>military service from the age of 18 to </v>
<v Speaker 2>the age of 30 spending one month every </v>

145
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:45.490
<v Speaker 2>single year serving in the military and </v>
<v Speaker 2>even after that service period they miss</v>

146
00:07:45.491 --> 00:07:46.324
<v Speaker 2>still keep a gun at home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it Switzerland's isn't the </v>

147
00:07:48.651 --> 00:07:51.170
<v Speaker 2>only country that does this with Norway </v>
<v Speaker 2>and Israel.</v>

148
00:07:51.230 --> 00:07:53.160
<v Speaker 2>Also having mandatory military sentence.</v>

149
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.030
<v Speaker 2>People argue that this system is good </v>
<v Speaker 2>with pundits saying that it creates more</v>

150
00:08:01.031 --> 00:08:04.060
<v Speaker 2>entrepreneurs and creates less income </v>
<v Speaker 2>disparity.</v>

151
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.370
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget that during that time in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the military,</v>

152
00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:11.320
<v Speaker 2>the rich and the poor on mixing together</v>
<v Speaker 2>several startups and companies have been</v>

153
00:08:11.321 --> 00:08:12.154
<v Speaker 2>created from relationships that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed while people were serving in the </v>

154
00:08:14.891 --> 00:08:15.724
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the big question is what about </v>

155
00:08:17.081 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 2>liberty?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What about the freedom to choose?</v>

156
00:08:19.301 --> 00:08:20.134
<v Speaker 2>What gives the government the right to </v>
<v Speaker 2>force you to work in a place that you </v>

157
00:08:23.141 --> 00:08:23.974
<v Speaker 2>might not want to work?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course we don't have the answers to </v>

158
00:08:26.531 --> 00:08:27.364
<v Speaker 2>these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they are just something for you to </v>

159
00:08:28.601 --> 00:08:29.350
<v Speaker 2>ponder.</v>

160
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.570
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Number</v>

161
00:08:32.570 --> 00:08:35.300
<v Speaker 2>six,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ease of doing business.</v>

162
00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.530
<v Speaker 2>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 2>inventing is perhaps the most well known</v>

163
00:08:37.531 --> 00:08:40.970
<v Speaker 2>to thing about Switzerland am's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is that taxes.</v>

164
00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 2>It's true despite the differences from </v>
<v Speaker 2>one council to another,</v>

165
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:47.090
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland does typically have very low</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxation.</v>

166
00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:48.373
<v Speaker 2>Further the laws to start a company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll a fairly simple and anyone can see </v>

167
00:08:50.931 --> 00:08:52.730
<v Speaker 2>those laws buying.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just giving online.</v>

168
00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:56.040
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>transparent freeze in the world.</v>

169
00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:57.143
<v Speaker 2>This is encouraged a lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>international companies to establish </v>

170
00:08:59.311 --> 00:09:00.144
<v Speaker 2>their fiscal residents in Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it also makes it very easy for </v>

171
00:09:02.971 --> 00:09:06.510
<v Speaker 2>people in Switzerland to set up their </v>
<v Speaker 2>company and yes.</v>

172
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:07.231
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

173
00:09:07.231 --> 00:09:09.990
<v Speaker 2>Banks do make up a large part of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Swiss economy,</v>

174
00:09:09.991 --> 00:09:11.930
<v Speaker 2>but it's probably not as big as you.</v>

175
00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:15.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

176
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:16.121
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

177
00:09:16.121 --> 00:09:16.954
<v Speaker 2>many other industries in Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It doesn't mean logitech mean anything </v>

178
00:09:20.231 --> 00:09:20.860
<v Speaker 2>to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

179
00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.320
<v Speaker 2>look at your mouse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Look at your Webcam.</v>

180
00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.940
<v Speaker 2>You'll probably see it printed on one of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those things.</v>

181
00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:25.893
<v Speaker 2>And this is a company that was formed in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland and then there's the </v>

182
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:31.390
<v Speaker 2>pharmaceuticals to the names,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Novartis or Hoffman Laroche Ring.</v>

183
00:09:31.391 --> 00:09:32.770
<v Speaker 2>Any bells?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not to mention,</v>

184
00:09:32.771 --> 00:09:33.820
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tourism,</v>

185
00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:36.340
<v Speaker 2>precision machinery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm that famous swaptions.</v>

186
00:09:36.430 --> 00:09:37.263
<v Speaker 2>I'm pretty sure you could mean five </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies that are from Switzerland are </v>

187
00:09:39.851 --> 00:09:42.390
<v Speaker 2>simply buying meanings and expensive </v>
<v Speaker 2>watch brands.</v>

188
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:46.060
<v Speaker 1>Ooh.</v>

189
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:50.500
<v Speaker 2>This is being done in a country with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>population that is smaller than New York</v>

190
00:09:50.501 --> 00:09:51.820
<v Speaker 2>City.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we always say,</v>

191
00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:52.683
<v Speaker 2>visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is not a country's natural resources </v>

192
00:09:54.701 --> 00:09:55.534
<v Speaker 2>and it is not luck.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The determine whether they are </v>

193
00:09:57.371 --> 00:09:58.204
<v Speaker 2>successful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's their system of government and the </v>

194
00:10:00.371 --> 00:10:04.450
<v Speaker 2>institutions that do this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And we believe that the Swiss have a lot</v>

195
00:10:04.451 --> 00:10:06.760
<v Speaker 2>to teach the rest of the world in this </v>
<v Speaker 2>regard.</v>

196
00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:11.360
<v Speaker 2>Just our opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you agree with us?</v>

197
00:10:11.361 --> 00:10:12.194
<v Speaker 2>Do you disagree with us at?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that your country could </v>

198
00:10:14.361 --> 00:10:17.110
<v Speaker 2>benefit from a system more in length,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Swiss?</v>

199
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:18.003
