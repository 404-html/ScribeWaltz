1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:00.893
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How much does the U s actually pay for </v>

2
00:00:02.761 --> 00:00:06.780
<v Speaker 1>its army and all the military operations</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they carry out day after day,</v>

3
00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:07.200
<v Speaker 1>all over the</v>

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.033
<v Speaker 2>wow.</v>

5
00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:14.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what we're going to try</v>

6
00:00:14.411 --> 00:00:15.244
<v Speaker 1>and answer in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But there's no debate when it comes to </v>

7
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.190
<v Speaker 1>one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's the,</v>

8
00:00:18.191 --> 00:00:20.500
<v Speaker 1>they're military industry is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most opaque,</v>

9
00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.383
<v Speaker 1>most influential hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most powerful industries in the United </v>

10
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.400
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

11
00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.233
<v Speaker 2>It's,</v>

12
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.493
<v Speaker 1>well that's true for the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>as it is for pretty much anywhere else </v>

13
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:30.604
<v Speaker 1>in the world too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I'm starting the question that I </v>

14
00:00:31.841 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 1>posed to just a moment ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means no more or no less than opening</v>

15
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.690
<v Speaker 1>a debate with a rather large </v>
<v Speaker 1>implications for,</v>

16
00:00:37.691 --> 00:00:38.980
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bill.</v>

17
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.560
<v Speaker 1>And it could be hundreds of billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

18
00:00:41.561 --> 00:00:42.910
<v Speaker 1>So having given that wanting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

19
00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 1>let's see what is happening within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>corridors of both the,</v>

20
00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:47.163
<v Speaker 1>again and the Capitol talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>u s army is going to involve exorbitant </v>

21
00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:02.840
<v Speaker 1>figures as well as a huge amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bureaucracy and political machinery.</v>

22
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.703
<v Speaker 1>So big amps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so opaque is this institution that we </v>

23
00:01:05.811 --> 00:01:08.160
<v Speaker 1>can practically talk about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A parallel governor.</v>

24
00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.410
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

25
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:11.243
<v Speaker 1>In 2015 a report and made by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon itself stated that they had to </v>

26
00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.054
<v Speaker 1>pay tens of billions or pizza,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tens of billions of dollars every year </v>

27
00:01:18.811 --> 00:01:22.650
<v Speaker 1>for extra costs caused by bad management</v>
<v Speaker 1>practices in the army.</v>

28
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.950
<v Speaker 1>Best Practices such as paying private </v>
<v Speaker 1>contractors,</v>

29
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.840
<v Speaker 1>more money than would be expected in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitive market.</v>

30
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.590
<v Speaker 1>We're going to be in peril because we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>spending dollars like it doesn't matter.</v>

31
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.573
<v Speaker 1>Robert L stine managing director </v>
<v Speaker 1>chartwell capital management and former </v>

32
00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:41.510
<v Speaker 1>chairman of the defense business board,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and do you know think that it's only the</v>

33
00:01:41.511 --> 00:01:44.200
<v Speaker 1>big military industrial companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who produce fighters,</v>

34
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.810
<v Speaker 1>missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other military equipment?</v>

35
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:46.970
<v Speaker 1>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

36
00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.863
<v Speaker 1>a good part of all of those billions </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have operated each year come from </v>

37
00:01:50.541 --> 00:01:52.640
<v Speaker 1>activities such as accounting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>logistics,</v>

38
00:01:52.641 --> 00:01:54.310
<v Speaker 1>or human resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that,</v>

39
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.303
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

40
00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.543
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bureaucracy of the US armed forces </v>

41
00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:00.130
<v Speaker 1>this super big,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's it.</v>

42
00:02:00.131 --> 00:02:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Employees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no less than a million people.</v>

43
00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this graphic from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post.</v>

44
00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:10.480
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s army,</v>

45
00:02:10.481 --> 00:02:11.314
<v Speaker 1>it has almost as many people in its </v>
<v Speaker 1>officer's doing administrative </v>

46
00:02:13.721 --> 00:02:17.530
<v Speaker 1>activities as it does people who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>preparing for war or performing national</v>

47
00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:19.240
<v Speaker 1>security tasks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had all of this,</v>

48
00:02:19.241 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes with an enormous costs.</v>

49
00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:25.870
<v Speaker 1>Almost a quarter of the military budget </v>
<v Speaker 1>is invested in these types of tasks,</v>

50
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>tasks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's all,</v>

51
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.930
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say importance,</v>

52
00:02:28.931 --> 00:02:30.760
<v Speaker 1>but I really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a quarter of the money,</v>

53
00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.060
<v Speaker 1>if you consider it another way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this bureaucracy alone by itself,</v>

54
00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:42.120
<v Speaker 1>counselors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the third largest military budget in the</v>

55
00:02:42.121 --> 00:02:42.954
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which actually wouldn't be too far </v>

56
00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.770
<v Speaker 1>behind the second biggest military </v>
<v Speaker 1>budget and that sort of China,</v>

57
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.000
<v Speaker 1>and that's not all according to a study </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Department of Defense itself,</v>

58
00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:55.770
<v Speaker 1>published in October,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 approximately one out of every five</v>

59
00:02:55.771 --> 00:02:56.604
<v Speaker 1>installations that the again has do </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing being synthy sit idle and they </v>

60
00:03:00.461 --> 00:03:03.850
<v Speaker 1>could be closed with no military </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences whatsoever.</v>

61
00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.480
<v Speaker 1>And this would save millions of dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>per year per each one.</v>

62
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:08.363
<v Speaker 1>But this is something that isn't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite supported by the politicians in </v>

63
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.394
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything that has to do with the </v>

64
00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.870
<v Speaker 1>Pentagon and the US Defense Department </v>
<v Speaker 1>involves talking about some gigantic,</v>

65
00:03:20.871 --> 00:03:24.170
<v Speaker 1>hyper bureaucratic and very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very expensive structures.</v>

66
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:25.063
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we're going to see later in this </v>

67
00:03:26.121 --> 00:03:26.954
<v Speaker 1>video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this waste is very important in </v>

68
00:03:29.511 --> 00:03:31.190
<v Speaker 1>the political debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now,</v>

69
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.053
<v Speaker 1>let's see how much money these military </v>
<v Speaker 1>adventures really costs the United </v>

70
00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.313
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

71
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.353
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

72
00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.170
<v Speaker 1>cost of war.</v>

73
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.860
<v Speaker 2>Does he know?</v>

74
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.913
<v Speaker 1>Just say says military adventures aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>randy that strange if we count the Cold </v>

75
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:51.723
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States has been at war since </v>

76
00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.340
<v Speaker 1>1941</v>

77
00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>homicide.</v>

78
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:02.040
<v Speaker 1>It's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we all know it since the end of 2001 the</v>

79
00:04:02.041 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>u s military has been involved in active</v>
<v Speaker 1>combat every year.</v>

80
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.320
<v Speaker 1>Syria operations in the Indian Ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

81
00:04:08.321 --> 00:04:09.154
<v Speaker 1>Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Eastern Europe and above all Iraq </v>

82
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:14.290
<v Speaker 1>and Afghanistan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't look like it's ending anytime</v>

83
00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:15.124
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now with all of this going on all </v>

84
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:17.404
<v Speaker 1>around the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine how much this stuff </v>

85
00:04:18.641 --> 00:04:19.570
<v Speaker 1>costs?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

86
00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:20.404
<v Speaker 1>pay attention here because the numbers </v>
<v Speaker 1>are probably more scandalous than you </v>

87
00:04:22.361 --> 00:04:23.194
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>

88
00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:27.270
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before we get into these numbers,</v>

89
00:04:27.271 --> 00:04:28.104
<v Speaker 1>let's mention a quick side note here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing is the annual defense budgets </v>

90
00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:33.330
<v Speaker 1>and another thing is the operating </v>
<v Speaker 1>budgets.</v>

91
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:36.300
<v Speaker 1>This means that when we hear about how </v>
<v Speaker 1>much the US spends on its army,</v>

92
00:04:36.301 --> 00:04:38.940
<v Speaker 1>the cost of wars and military operations</v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves,</v>

93
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.760
<v Speaker 1>arms usually taken into account all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors there.</v>

94
00:04:41.761 --> 00:04:42.594
<v Speaker 1>Since 2001 US taxpayers have spent just </v>
<v Speaker 1>in those military adventures and loan a </v>

95
00:04:46.981 --> 00:04:51.510
<v Speaker 1>whopping one point $7 trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one point $7 trillion by the way,</v>

96
00:04:51.511 --> 00:04:52.344
<v Speaker 1>is more than Canada's GDP and almost as </v>
<v Speaker 1>much as Italy's put it another way in </v>

97
00:04:55.021 --> 00:04:59.580
<v Speaker 1>today's dollars that is more than twice </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the Vietnam War costs or five times</v>

98
00:04:59.581 --> 00:05:04.581
<v Speaker 1>that of the cost of the Korean War </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought DB Capitol Hill.</v>

99
00:05:06.911 --> 00:05:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Because if you think this is a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>figure,</v>

100
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.340
<v Speaker 1>well wait just a minute because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't done yet.</v>

101
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.620
<v Speaker 3>Cool</v>

102
00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 1>of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for </v>
<v Speaker 1>example,</v>

103
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.723
<v Speaker 1>isn't over,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I'm not referring only to the </v>

104
00:05:20.321 --> 00:05:21.154
<v Speaker 1>military expenditures that or has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also to the costs that have already </v>

105
00:05:24.191 --> 00:05:25.024
<v Speaker 1>occurred,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which the federal governments will have </v>

106
00:05:26.441 --> 00:05:27.550
<v Speaker 1>to pay for in the future.</v>

107
00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 3>Of course costs</v>

108
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:31.853
<v Speaker 1>such as long term medical care for ex </v>
<v Speaker 1>combatants due to injuries produced in </v>

109
00:05:34.301 --> 00:05:35.134
<v Speaker 1>combat expenses for veterans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course the cost of the debts </v>

110
00:05:37.691 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>incurred to finance the war in total </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimate states that these p was alone.</v>

111
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.603
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it ends up costing between four and $6 </v>

112
00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:46.263
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is just a vast amount of money to </v>

113
00:05:47.531 --> 00:05:48.364
<v Speaker 1>get some idea of the real costs here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the equivalent to all of the </v>

114
00:05:50.291 --> 00:05:51.124
<v Speaker 1>military expenditure for all European </v>
<v Speaker 1>NATO countries for the next 15 to 23 </v>

115
00:05:55.271 --> 00:05:57.530
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these military adventures,</v>

116
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.560
<v Speaker 1>they are a total financial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

117
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.623
<v Speaker 2>mess.</v>

118
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:03.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we think that countries should take a </v>

119
00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:06.700
<v Speaker 1>look at these bills and be more prudent </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the future.</v>

120
00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.140
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when one visits to the United States,</v>

121
00:06:12.141 --> 00:06:15.110
<v Speaker 1>something that draws the attention is </v>
<v Speaker 1>the poor state of its infrastructure,</v>

122
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>its roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its metro,</v>

123
00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:17.510
<v Speaker 1>its railroads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

124
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:18.373
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure in the u s has the guns </v>

125
00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:20.383
<v Speaker 1>to be a serious problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We spend trillions and trillions of </v>

126
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:27.710
<v Speaker 1>dollars outside of our nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can't build a road,</v>

127
00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:29.090
<v Speaker 1>a highway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a tunnel,</v>

128
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:32.890
<v Speaker 1>a bridge in our own nation and we watch </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything falling into district.</v>

129
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.380
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well</v>

130
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>with what the Iraq and Afghanistan wars </v>
<v Speaker 1>of costs,</v>

131
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.950
<v Speaker 1>the United States could have the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure in the world.</v>

132
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:43.143
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

133
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.190
<v Speaker 1>Pasta 30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The American hat,</v>

134
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:48.263
<v Speaker 1>13 walls spanning 14 point $2 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the spread of proud of them </v>

135
00:06:53.451 --> 00:06:54.284
<v Speaker 1>money on building up the infrastructure?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What if the money spin on the Middle </v>

136
00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.650
<v Speaker 1>East,</v>
<v Speaker 1>middle west of the United States,</v>

137
00:07:02.010 --> 00:07:05.190
<v Speaker 1>developing the industry there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that could be changed a lot.</v>

138
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:10.200
<v Speaker 1>So it's not peep the other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>stew jobs from your guys.</v>

139
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:13.770
<v Speaker 1>It is your strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far I think things are quite clear.</v>

140
00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:14.663
<v Speaker 1>We have now seen how much Washington is </v>
<v Speaker 1>military adventures around the world if </v>

141
00:07:17.101 --> 00:07:18.660
<v Speaker 1>cost the American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

142
00:07:18.661 --> 00:07:19.494
<v Speaker 1>I think it's going to be interesting to </v>
<v Speaker 1>see how much the federal government </v>

143
00:07:21.181 --> 00:07:23.640
<v Speaker 1>really spends every year on the fence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hands.</v>

144
00:07:23.641 --> 00:07:25.830
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to say that if you haven't </v>
<v Speaker 1>been surprised so far,</v>

145
00:07:25.831 --> 00:07:27.710
<v Speaker 1>you probably are about to be</v>

146
00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.393
<v Speaker 2>done.</v>

147
00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:36.680
<v Speaker 4>Scott.</v>
<v Speaker 4>We dominate the sea.</v>

148
00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.770
<v Speaker 4>We dominate the land and space</v>

149
00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>crew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military expenditure.</v>

150
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.303
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

151
00:07:50.340 --> 00:07:53.880
<v Speaker 1>More or less than the US defense budget </v>
<v Speaker 1>is by far the largest in the wells.</v>

152
00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:54.773
<v Speaker 1>Consider 2017 as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this year of $560 billion were spent </v>

153
00:07:58.771 --> 00:07:59.604
<v Speaker 1>on the fence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course we also have to add that </v>

154
00:08:00.991 --> 00:08:01.824
<v Speaker 1>$60 billion for operating expenses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is approximately three times the </v>

155
00:08:05.671 --> 00:08:06.504
<v Speaker 1>military expenditure of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or nine times the military expenditure </v>

156
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.440
<v Speaker 1>of Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

157
00:08:10.470 --> 00:08:11.880
<v Speaker 1>these amounts don't,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dude,</v>

158
00:08:11.910 --> 00:08:15.150
<v Speaker 1>all of the expenses that the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>well generates for the u s government.</v>

159
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:16.013
<v Speaker 1>Consider for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of medical treatment for those </v>

160
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:20.340
<v Speaker 1>wounded in combat or the costs of </v>
<v Speaker 1>veteran expenses.</v>

161
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:21.233
<v Speaker 1>Have a quick look at this</v>

162
00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:22.093
<v Speaker 2>scruff.</v>

163
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

164
00:08:26.391 --> 00:08:27.224
<v Speaker 1>if we take all of these expenses into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account that the armed forces expenses </v>

165
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:33.920
<v Speaker 1>rise above $900 billion par.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

166
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:34.813
<v Speaker 1>that's nearly a trillion dollars and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>still need to consider it national </v>

167
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.450
<v Speaker 1>security expenses like financing </v>
<v Speaker 1>intelligence agencies such as the CIA,</v>

168
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:47.660
<v Speaker 1>but even if we only take the department </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Defense and nuclear weapons budgets,</v>

169
00:08:47.661 --> 00:08:48.494
<v Speaker 1>which is $620 billion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can see how the military efforts in </v>

170
00:08:52.011 --> 00:08:55.070
<v Speaker 1>GDP terms is one of the largest in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

171
00:09:00.450 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>However you want to look at those </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

172
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:02.813
<v Speaker 1>They are exorbitant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we finish answering today's </v>

173
00:09:04.711 --> 00:09:06.990
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just wait for a moment because the</v>

174
00:09:06.991 --> 00:09:07.824
<v Speaker 1>u s military dominance is somewhat less </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive when we consider the </v>

175
00:09:10.651 --> 00:09:15.651
<v Speaker 1>following factors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First price difference.</v>

176
00:09:16.850 --> 00:09:21.740
<v Speaker 1>That is you comms by the same things </v>
<v Speaker 1>with $1 in the u s as you can with $1 in</v>

177
00:09:21.741 --> 00:09:23.240
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we correct this,</v>

178
00:09:23.241 --> 00:09:26.540
<v Speaker 1>we would see that the u s military </v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditure would be equal to the sum of</v>

179
00:09:26.541 --> 00:09:30.860
<v Speaker 1>China and Russia's military expenditure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's still an enormous amounts,</v>

180
00:09:30.861 --> 00:09:35.861
<v Speaker 1>but it's not as impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pins and this is really important,</v>

181
00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:42.240
<v Speaker 1>we have to consider how things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed in recent.</v>

182
00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:43.074
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>allow me to explain her in constant </v>

183
00:09:44.521 --> 00:09:46.380
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is adjusting for inflation.</v>

184
00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:47.273
<v Speaker 1>Real defense expenditures have actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen since 2010 by 25% this is </v>

185
00:09:51.451 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 1>unquestionably the largest reduction in </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades and in a way,</v>

186
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.643
<v Speaker 1>this is what is great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're worrying many analysts and </v>

187
00:09:57.391 --> 00:10:00.180
<v Speaker 1>politicians in Washington,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the Republican Party,</v>

188
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.800
<v Speaker 5>I understand we're in an election year.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I understand all that,</v>

189
00:10:02.801 --> 00:10:07.801
<v Speaker 5>but how in the world do you refuse to </v>
<v Speaker 5>take up legislation that is only purpose</v>

190
00:10:08.231 --> 00:10:11.620
<v Speaker 5>is to defend this nation,</v>
<v Speaker 5>which is under a shop.</v>

191
00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:16.270
<v Speaker 5>We rely on these young men and women.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We rely on them to defend the nation and</v>

192
00:10:16.271 --> 00:10:20.280
<v Speaker 5>now we won't even act to train,</v>
<v Speaker 5>equip,</v>

193
00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.910
<v Speaker 5>pay,</v>
<v Speaker 5>and care for them.</v>

194
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:23.083
<v Speaker 1>Could it be that despite all the money </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the U S is spending today on </v>

195
00:10:25.401 --> 00:10:27.560
<v Speaker 1>defense,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's still isn't enough?</v>

196
00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's consider it.</v>

197
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:29.883
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

198
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:34.800
<v Speaker 1>Waning power</v>

199
00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:38.150
<v Speaker 2>since</v>

200
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:39.410
<v Speaker 1>fall of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

201
00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:41.680
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

202
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:44.460
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That all of you.</v>

203
00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:45.433
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You said</v>

204
00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:46.913
<v Speaker 1>z consequent Dan's of the Cold War.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It could be expected that the size of </v>

205
00:10:49.391 --> 00:10:52.840
<v Speaker 1>the United States armed forces has </v>
<v Speaker 1>decreased substantially.</v>

206
00:10:52.870 --> 00:10:55.720
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about fewer submarines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer aircraft carriers,</v>

207
00:10:55.721 --> 00:10:57.430
<v Speaker 1>fewer bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fewer soldiers,</v>

208
00:10:57.431 --> 00:10:58.690
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

209
00:11:00.100 --> 00:11:00.933
<v Speaker 1>How has the new equipment has arrived </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the aft 22 wraps or the b two </v>

210
00:11:04.031 --> 00:11:04.864
<v Speaker 1>bomber,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the f 35 a new class of aircraft </v>

211
00:11:06.461 --> 00:11:07.780
<v Speaker 1>carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new cruisers,</v>

212
00:11:07.781 --> 00:11:10.370
<v Speaker 1>and among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high precision drones and miss</v>

213
00:11:16.260 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>what all of this technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation has had two consequences.</v>

214
00:11:19.530 --> 00:11:22.440
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand it has increased the u s</v>
<v Speaker 1>military capabilities,</v>

215
00:11:22.470 --> 00:11:23.303
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand it has altered </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipments and operational costs and of </v>

216
00:11:26.491 --> 00:11:30.390
<v Speaker 1>course as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the budget has been decreasing in recent</v>

217
00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.223
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Years of underfunding have given us a </v>

218
00:11:32.791 --> 00:11:37.170
<v Speaker 1>weakened force that despite the hard </v>
<v Speaker 1>work of our brave troops is ill equipped</v>

219
00:11:37.171 --> 00:11:39.390
<v Speaker 1>to handle the missions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We keep throwing at it.</v>

220
00:11:39.510 --> 00:11:40.343
<v Speaker 1>Edwin j fullmer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>founder and president of the Heritage </v>

221
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:45.160
<v Speaker 1>Foundation do you to all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Republican Party,</v>

222
00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:46.023
<v Speaker 1>and also it must be said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a large part of the Democratic Party </v>

223
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.190
<v Speaker 1>seem to have something quite clear in </v>
<v Speaker 1>their minds.</v>

224
00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:52.950
<v Speaker 1>The military budget must be increased.</v>

225
00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:55.253
<v Speaker 6>Currently</v>

226
00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 1>the smallest army since 1940</v>

227
00:11:59.530 --> 00:12:04.530
<v Speaker 6>our navy is at its smallest size.</v>
<v Speaker 6>Since 1917 I would send weapons.</v>

228
00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:05.453
<v Speaker 6>You were crane.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The first thing we need to do to make </v>

229
00:12:07.721 --> 00:12:09.670
<v Speaker 6>America stronger as a strength of our </v>
<v Speaker 6>military</v>

230
00:12:11.670 --> 00:12:14.940
<v Speaker 1>as candidates for the presidency and </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous Arizona Senator John Mccain,</v>

231
00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:15.803
<v Speaker 1>who incidentally is the chairman of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Armed Services Committee of the </v>

232
00:12:17.731 --> 00:12:19.170
<v Speaker 1>sentence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is one of the politicians.</v>

233
00:12:19.171 --> 00:12:20.004
<v Speaker 1>He was most committed to this issue and </v>
<v Speaker 1>has proposed raising the military </v>

234
00:12:22.351 --> 00:12:23.184
<v Speaker 1>budgets to $800 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They say that the current scas military </v>

235
00:12:26.161 --> 00:12:27.090
<v Speaker 1>budget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

236
00:12:27.091 --> 00:12:29.940
<v Speaker 1>of course the accidents that the u s </v>
<v Speaker 1>navy has had in the Pacific,</v>

237
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:34.850
<v Speaker 1>US Navy relieves admiral in charge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh fleet in wake of deadly disaster</v>

238
00:12:34.851 --> 00:12:35.684
<v Speaker 1>at see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is as well as causing new and </v>

239
00:12:37.111 --> 00:12:40.860
<v Speaker 1>emerging threats such as that if North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea or an increasingly strong China,</v>

240
00:12:40.880 --> 00:12:43.290
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dealing with these increasing threats is</v>

241
00:12:43.291 --> 00:12:44.190
<v Speaker 1>not going to be</v>

242
00:12:44.260 --> 00:12:45.093
<v Speaker 6>she</v>

243
00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.870
<v Speaker 1>doing and modernizing the nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>arsenal that is,</v>

244
00:12:48.871 --> 00:12:50.630
<v Speaker 1>and nuclear weapons bombers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles,</v>

245
00:12:50.631 --> 00:12:51.464
<v Speaker 1>and submarines is trump promised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>implies an investment in the next 30 </v>

246
00:12:54.141 --> 00:12:56.810
<v Speaker 1>years of more than one point $2 </v>
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>

247
00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:58.820
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you spend more than anyone else,</v>

248
00:12:58.821 --> 00:12:59.810
<v Speaker 1>much more,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

249
00:12:59.811 --> 00:13:02.930
<v Speaker 1>and you all still note Belita,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shouldn't you perhaps be rethinking your</v>

250
00:13:02.931 --> 00:13:03.764
<v Speaker 1>strategy should in the u s perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 1>modifying his role in some way so it's </v>

251
00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:09.290
<v Speaker 1>not as involved in so many conflicts </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

252
00:13:09.320 --> 00:13:11.940
<v Speaker 1>And further there's the question of </v>
<v Speaker 1>whether military expenditure,</v>

253
00:13:11.941 --> 00:13:12.774
<v Speaker 1>it really helps national security or </v>
<v Speaker 1>does it really just help the arms </v>

254
00:13:15.081 --> 00:13:15.914
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's important to note here that </v>

255
00:13:17.061 --> 00:13:17.894
<v Speaker 1>that arms industry does generously </v>
<v Speaker 1>finance lobbyists and political </v>

256
00:13:20.781 --> 00:13:21.980
<v Speaker 1>campaigns.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:22.893
<v Speaker 1>if he's hanging out the questions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the answers that pretty much are your </v>

258
00:13:25.071 --> 00:13:26.120
<v Speaker 1>penance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

259
00:13:26.121 --> 00:13:29.090
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the u s should </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase its military budgets?</v>

260
00:13:29.091 --> 00:13:29.841
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
