1
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.300
<v Speaker 1>The situation has been tense for years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's on June the fifth,</v>

2
00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:13.134
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly the conflict reached another </v>

3
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.180
<v Speaker 1>dimension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Arabia,</v>

4
00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.073
<v Speaker 1>the Arab Emirates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bahrain and Egypt announced the </v>

5
00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.600
<v Speaker 1>fulminating rupture of their relations </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the emirate of Qatar,</v>

6
00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:27.434
<v Speaker 1>including the closing of borders and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibition of the use of ports of </v>

7
00:00:30.741 --> 00:00:31.220
<v Speaker 1>asked.</v>

8
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:32.053
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

9
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.190
<v Speaker 1>Certainly old communication was cut off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was practically a total block aid.</v>

10
00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:38.053
<v Speaker 1>The next night planes and cargo ships </v>
<v Speaker 1>bound for Qatar were forced to change </v>

11
00:00:41.451 --> 00:00:43.580
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not even the camels were spared.</v>

12
00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.670
<v Speaker 1>The Saudis immediately expelled is no </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than 12,000</v>

13
00:00:46.671 --> 00:00:48.620
<v Speaker 1>camels that were grazing in that </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

14
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.180
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>

15
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.910
<v Speaker 1>So were there any land border closed up </v>
<v Speaker 1>in practical terms,</v>

16
00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:56.870
<v Speaker 1>the emirate of Qatar went from being a </v>
<v Speaker 1>peninsula to becoming an island,</v>

17
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.090
<v Speaker 1>threatens by its neighbors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by land,</v>

18
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>sea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and air.</v>

19
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.470
<v Speaker 1>At the time this was happening,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions were asked,</v>

20
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.333
<v Speaker 1>how long can guitar hold on for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are we facing the preview to a military </v>

21
00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:10.670
<v Speaker 1>intervention and has this emirate </v>
<v Speaker 1>splendor reached its end?</v>

22
00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.533
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today in this video we're going to see </v>

23
00:01:12.141 --> 00:01:14.270
<v Speaker 1>exactly what happens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how things are today,</v>

24
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>and what we can expect in the future </v>
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>

25
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.570
<v Speaker 1>Now we are going to see the results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>

26
00:01:29.571 --> 00:01:31.000
<v Speaker 1>what you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bow,</v>

27
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 1>did they get into this situation in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first place?</v>

28
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.380
<v Speaker 1>What the hell happened as an almost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>disputes.</v>

29
00:01:39.021 --> 00:01:43.250
<v Speaker 1>There are lots of reasons on the table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that the regardance Abu</v>

30
00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.083
<v Speaker 1>Dhabi government swept tires.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Guitar always being free than to </v>

31
00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:47.523
<v Speaker 1>bubble,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to cast off their growing </v>

32
00:01:49.131 --> 00:01:53.150
<v Speaker 1>relations with Iran and closed down Al </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jazeera once and for all.</v>

33
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.220
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

34
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.760
<v Speaker 1>these were the basic conditions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>were imposed on guitar in order to start</v>

35
00:01:58.761 --> 00:01:59.594
<v Speaker 1>a dialogue after agreeing on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockades conditions that Doha outright </v>

36
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:05.540
<v Speaker 1>rejects it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But having said all of that,</v>

37
00:02:05.541 --> 00:02:06.374
<v Speaker 1>let's get right to the point at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone bed that this whole mess would </v>

38
00:02:09.801 --> 00:02:14.240
<v Speaker 1>be temporary and that it would resolve </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively quickly one way or another.</v>

39
00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.133
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would think that such a small </v>

40
00:02:16.101 --> 00:02:16.934
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country that has barely 2 million </v>

41
00:02:18.321 --> 00:02:20.600
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants and that is practically a </v>
<v Speaker 1>desert,</v>

42
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.860
<v Speaker 1>would be able to resist for very long </v>
<v Speaker 1>without simply giving up.</v>

43
00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.730
<v Speaker 1>It seems pretty impossible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

44
00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:26.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to view it,</v>

45
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:27.463
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what is happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has not resulted in the way they </v>

46
00:02:31.881 --> 00:02:32.714
<v Speaker 1>wanted it to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They wanted to take control of our </v>

47
00:02:34.311 --> 00:02:38.120
<v Speaker 1>decisions and get us to comply with </v>
<v Speaker 1>their demands that has failed.</v>

48
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.170
<v Speaker 1>Katara will never be for sale to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockade in countries or to anyone else.</v>

49
00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.250
<v Speaker 1>We are a sovereign country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We will remain a sovereign country safe.</v>

50
00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.113
<v Speaker 1>I'll punny,</v>
<v Speaker 1>director of Qatar's government </v>

51
00:02:48.621 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 1>communications office.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

52
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.480
<v Speaker 1>throughout the first few hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the emirate underwent a very,</v>

53
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.343
<v Speaker 1>very tense situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many supplies including basic products </v>

54
00:02:57.231 --> 00:03:00.730
<v Speaker 1>such as food stopped arriving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the stock market collapsed,</v>

55
00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>and even the option of military </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention didn't seem far fetched.</v>

56
00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:06.543
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smoke Itsari army was no match for </v>

57
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:11.380
<v Speaker 1>the billion dollar war machines of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring countries.</v>

58
00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a successful intervention that dependent</v>

59
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:14.523
<v Speaker 1>on the approval of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has one of its most important </v>

60
00:03:17.441 --> 00:03:20.360
<v Speaker 1>military bases in the world located in </v>
<v Speaker 1>guitar,</v>

61
00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:21.483
<v Speaker 1>even though this approval was likely </v>
<v Speaker 1>just in case heart decided to ask for </v>

62
00:03:25.301 --> 00:03:26.134
<v Speaker 1>Istanbul's help,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turkish parliament approved spill to </v>

63
00:03:38.691 --> 00:03:41.660
<v Speaker 1>deploy troops in Qatar the situation </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

64
00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:44.750
<v Speaker 1>it was looking to be quite difficult and</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite complex,</v>

65
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a moment because Qatar well </v>
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>

66
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:49.860
<v Speaker 1>another ace up their sleeve as we told </v>
<v Speaker 1>you,</v>

67
00:03:49.861 --> 00:03:52.720
<v Speaker 1>you in a previous video in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Emirates,</v>

68
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.623
<v Speaker 1>they've done their homework thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 1>its oil and especially natural gas </v>

69
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:58.490
<v Speaker 1>exploitation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the country has managed to accumulate</v>

70
00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:59.383
<v Speaker 1>a fortune of more than $300,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a fortune by the way that they've </v>

71
00:04:03.321 --> 00:04:04.910
<v Speaker 1>invested all over the planet.</v>

72
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

73
00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.233
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also managed to become a country </v>

74
00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:11.543
<v Speaker 1>that's much more open to the world as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with a foreign policy that's </v>

75
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.263
<v Speaker 1>independent of its.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely what made this blockade </v>

76
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:23.310
<v Speaker 1>total failure.</v>

77
00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.143
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

78
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:25.463
<v Speaker 1>Blockade Strategy was corner us </v>
<v Speaker 1>economically that has completely failed </v>

79
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:30.510
<v Speaker 1>and it will not work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alisha reef,</v>

80
00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:32.880
<v Speaker 1>I'll mid finance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>minister of Qatar.</v>

81
00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.853
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent months the stock market has </v>

82
00:04:35.641 --> 00:04:36.474
<v Speaker 1>recovered investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've stopped running away and even </v>

83
00:04:38.371 --> 00:04:40.620
<v Speaker 1>though many prices rose due to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockade,</v>

84
00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.820
<v Speaker 1>even the international monetary funds in</v>
<v Speaker 1>a report published on March the fifth,</v>

85
00:04:44.821 --> 00:04:45.654
<v Speaker 1>2018 stated that the Qatari economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>would grow by almost three percent this </v>

86
00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

87
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:50.973
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

88
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.330
<v Speaker 1>x is that the country hasn't only </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed to open new commercial rates and</v>

89
00:04:57.331 --> 00:04:59.940
<v Speaker 1>achieve alternatives to transport it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchandise.</v>

90
00:04:59.941 --> 00:05:03.330
<v Speaker 1>Many multinationals like aged in Dubai,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can no longer send that.</v>

91
00:05:03.331 --> 00:05:07.680
<v Speaker 1>People by playing to Doha have decided </v>
<v Speaker 1>to open that own officers there.</v>

92
00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:09.060
<v Speaker 1>This means that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

93
00:05:09.061 --> 00:05:09.894
<v Speaker 1>the number of companies in the financial</v>
<v Speaker 1>center has grown by 70 percent in the </v>

94
00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.400
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>past 15 years.</v>

95
00:05:22.991 --> 00:05:25.540
<v Speaker 1>We were the fastest growing economy on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>

96
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:30.420
<v Speaker 1>You're talking about a $6,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>economy in 2000 turning into a $200,</v>

97
00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:31.263
<v Speaker 1>billion dollar economy in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The blockading countries tried to make </v>

98
00:05:34.511 --> 00:05:36.940
<v Speaker 1>businesses decide between them and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatar,</v>

99
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.310
<v Speaker 1>but they backed away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yusuf Mohammed,</v>

100
00:05:39.311 --> 00:05:40.144
<v Speaker 1>al Qaeda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the head of the Qatar financial </v>

101
00:05:41.951 --> 00:05:42.784
<v Speaker 1>authority to view it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It might actually seem that this </v>

102
00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:48.430
<v Speaker 1>blockade might actually ends up helping </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatar if you don't believe me well,</v>

103
00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>perhaps listens to this in Qatar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kate,</v>

104
00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.480
<v Speaker 1>it has clearly been a challenge for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Qatari economy and their society.</v>

105
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.343
<v Speaker 1>Having an isolated country like that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's generally a really terrible deal </v>

106
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.160
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely due to that during this time,</v>

107
00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.053
<v Speaker 1>one of the Emirates government's biggest</v>
<v Speaker 1>priorities has been to compensate for </v>

108
00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:22.650
<v Speaker 1>the blockades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>negative consequences,</v>

109
00:06:22.651 --> 00:06:27.240
<v Speaker 1>and convince investors that cutoff is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a good country to invest in</v>

110
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>and to try and gain a lot of influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>around the world.</v>

111
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:33.133
<v Speaker 1>This is something that's indispensable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to prevent it to nate as especially </v>

112
00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:39.320
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia from guessing future </v>
<v Speaker 1>expansionist temptations,</v>

113
00:06:39.350 --> 00:06:40.490
<v Speaker 1>but now you may be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

114
00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.960
<v Speaker 1>how can they achieve out of this?</v>

115
00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:51.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

116
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.313
<v Speaker 1>one way is by pushing reformance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's something they've done in recent </v>

117
00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.023
<v Speaker 1>months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Qatari government has promoted </v>

118
00:06:57.690 --> 00:06:58.523
<v Speaker 1>several changes to improve the country's</v>
<v Speaker 1>image in the world and to be more </v>

119
00:07:01.561 --> 00:07:03.870
<v Speaker 1>competitive for international investors.</v>

120
00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:09.530
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visas have been removed for more than 80</v>

121
00:07:09.531 --> 00:07:10.364
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The rights of foreign residents have </v>

122
00:07:11.421 --> 00:07:14.600
<v Speaker 1>increased and more free zones have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>established.</v>

123
00:07:14.710 --> 00:07:18.410
<v Speaker 1>Further two very important changes have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been announced for one,</v>

124
00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:19.273
<v Speaker 1>they called for elections for the very </v>
<v Speaker 1>first time to elect members for the </v>

125
00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:25.370
<v Speaker 1>consultive assembling something like a </v>
<v Speaker 1>local parliaments.</v>

126
00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.830
<v Speaker 1>Now this is a pretty limited </v>
<v Speaker 1>parliaments,</v>

127
00:07:27.831 --> 00:07:28.664
<v Speaker 1>but at least it's a step in the right </v>
<v Speaker 1>direction and this is a particularly </v>

128
00:07:31.311 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>important step when we account for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that we're talking about is a place</v>

129
00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:35.504
<v Speaker 1>that still works with a political system</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on absolute monarchy and for </v>

130
00:07:38.871 --> 00:07:40.880
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more than reprehensible could follow</v>

131
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.723
<v Speaker 1>system will be coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a system that makes foreign </v>

132
00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:45.290
<v Speaker 1>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the poorest,</v>

133
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:46.153
<v Speaker 1>have to rely on their employers for that</v>
<v Speaker 1>visa and legal status and has very few </v>

134
00:07:49.671 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>legal repercussions for exploitation </v>
<v Speaker 1>making,</v>

135
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.530
<v Speaker 1>working conditions very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very bad.</v>

136
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:57.470
<v Speaker 1>In some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've probably heard of the allegations</v>

137
00:07:57.471 --> 00:07:59.930
<v Speaker 1>about slave workers in the Persian Gulf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

138
00:07:59.990 --> 00:08:01.820
<v Speaker 1>this is what we're talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

139
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:02.683
<v Speaker 1>now with the latest labor changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these workers will have better </v>

140
00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:05.984
<v Speaker 1>protected rights and we'll be able to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change jobs or leave the country </v>

141
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:09.433
<v Speaker 1>whenever they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these reforms would have taken a </v>

142
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:14.960
<v Speaker 1>lot longer were it not?</v>
<v Speaker 1>For the blockade,</v>

143
00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 1>it's been a blessing in disguise when it</v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to business.</v>

144
00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:19.670
<v Speaker 1>You see Mohammed algae,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aida,</v>

145
00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.280
<v Speaker 1>head of the Qatar financial authority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

146
00:08:22.281 --> 00:08:23.114
<v Speaker 1>the blockade is achieving things that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the international community has been </v>

147
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.250
<v Speaker 1>demanding for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but having said that,</v>

148
00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:31.670
<v Speaker 1>we still have a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very important question to answer.</v>

149
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.533
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what Qatar strategy has been</v>
<v Speaker 1>to gain influence in the world and </v>

150
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:37.250
<v Speaker 1>strengthen its position?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

151
00:08:37.340 --> 00:08:38.173
<v Speaker 1>listen up</v>

152
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:50.810
<v Speaker 2>the strategy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We</v>

153
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.000
<v Speaker 1>all know that there are very economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>sectors in the welds.</v>

154
00:08:57.060 --> 00:08:58.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two industries in particular,</v>

155
00:08:58.810 --> 00:08:59.643
<v Speaker 1>standout one due to its ability to </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence politics and another due to </v>

156
00:09:02.641 --> 00:09:05.310
<v Speaker 1>its ability to influence society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

157
00:09:05.790 --> 00:09:06.623
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the military industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the entertainment industry and you </v>

158
00:09:09.121 --> 00:09:09.954
<v Speaker 1>know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's precisely in these industries that </v>

159
00:09:11.641 --> 00:09:13.770
<v Speaker 1>Qatar has concentrated its strategy.</v>

160
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:20.303
<v Speaker 1>In recent months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Qatari government has announced </v>

161
00:09:22.231 --> 00:09:26.010
<v Speaker 1>military contracts for more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>$25,000,000,000</v>

162
00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:28.680
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of their objectives is to equip that</v>

163
00:09:28.710 --> 00:09:30.240
<v Speaker 1>army to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if necessary,</v>

164
00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:34.560
<v Speaker 1>make invasions more difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But the truth is that no matter how much</v>

165
00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:35.394
<v Speaker 1>they invest in weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Catala Williams be able to replicate </v>

166
00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:38.693
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia's military power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wait just a moment because there's </v>

167
00:09:41.491 --> 00:09:42.324
<v Speaker 1>another objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what better way to influence Washington </v>

168
00:09:44.431 --> 00:09:45.264
<v Speaker 1>and get support than by making an </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry that practically every </v>

169
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:50.370
<v Speaker 1>government in the world consider </v>
<v Speaker 1>strategic happy.</v>

170
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.060
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the contracts went to the United</v>

171
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:54.893
<v Speaker 1>States and European countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't support the blockade is whether </v>

172
00:09:57.211 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France and Germany,</v>

173
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.270
<v Speaker 1>planes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tanks,</v>

174
00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:03.450
<v Speaker 1>helicopters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot [inaudible] is buying everything.</v>

175
00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:06.720
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's never going to be able to</v>
<v Speaker 1>reach Saudi Arabia's level,</v>

176
00:10:06.721 --> 00:10:09.960
<v Speaker 1>but it hasn't suddenly become a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>prominent clients.</v>

177
00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:10.883
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that Qataris are really </v>

178
00:10:12.211 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 1>experts in contracting security </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>

179
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.341
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

185
00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.140
<v Speaker 1>it is one of the most important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States spaces in the world.</v>

186
00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:42.340

213
00:11:55.241 --> 00:11:58.150
<v Speaker 1>the qatari authorities decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reinforce the strategy,</v>

214
00:11:58.180 --> 00:11:59.013
<v Speaker 1>which for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the psg to spend billions and </v>
