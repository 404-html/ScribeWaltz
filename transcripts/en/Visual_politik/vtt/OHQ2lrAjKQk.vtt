1
00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:09.543
<v Speaker 1>Two thousand and 17 is the year that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada celebrates 150 years of </v>

2
00:00:13.361 --> 00:00:18.361
<v Speaker 1>existence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The specific day of their birth date was</v>

3
00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:24.130
<v Speaker 1>the first of July.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So.</v>

4
00:00:24.131 --> 00:00:26.260
<v Speaker 1>Well happy belated birthday</v>

5
00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:27.153
<v Speaker 2>Canada.</v>

6
00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.820
<v Speaker 1>Well did you at 150 years of existence </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not the only matter.</v>

7
00:00:33.821 --> 00:00:34.654
<v Speaker 1>We should be congratulating Canada on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country reached its One hundred and </v>

8
00:00:37.631 --> 00:00:38.464
<v Speaker 1>50th anniversary in great shape because.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well if there's something we can say </v>

9
00:00:42.251 --> 00:00:46.260
<v Speaker 1>about Canada right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the country certainly in low.</v>

10
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.203
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

11
00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.503
<v Speaker 1>And yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada is also the homelands of many </v>

12
00:00:52.881 --> 00:00:54.950
<v Speaker 1>celebrities that we all know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.550
<v Speaker 1>Mazda has been one celebrity who has </v>
<v Speaker 1>been putting the international political</v>

14
00:01:06.551 --> 00:01:09.390
<v Speaker 1>spotlight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're of course talking about Justin.</v>

15
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.870
<v Speaker 2>Oh No,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

16
00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:13.101
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

17
00:01:13.101 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

18
00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.961
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

19
00:01:13.961 --> 00:01:14.890
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not that.</v>

20
00:01:14.891 --> 00:01:16.360
<v Speaker 1>Justin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We met this one.</v>

21
00:01:16.361 --> 00:01:18.100
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Justin Trudeau.</v>

22
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:22.483
<v Speaker 1>It has reached its 150th birthday as one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the richest countries in the world </v>

23
00:01:25.821 --> 00:01:26.654
<v Speaker 1>with a top notch quality of life as well</v>
<v Speaker 1>as being one of the most admired </v>

24
00:01:29.271 --> 00:01:31.910
<v Speaker 1>countries on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly not bad.</v>

25
00:01:31.911 --> 00:01:32.744
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering what is </v>

26
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:35.174
<v Speaker 1>the cause of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What are the main achievements that </v>

27
00:01:36.771 --> 00:01:40.490
<v Speaker 1>Canada is celebrating after 150 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and importantly,</v>

28
00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:41.383
<v Speaker 1>why is there a dark side to Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to answer all of these </v>

29
00:01:44.181 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>questions in this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>

30
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.530
<v Speaker 1>let us get some perspective,</v>

31
00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.390
<v Speaker 3>a great transformation,</v>

32
00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:54.643
<v Speaker 1>not have had much about Canada recently,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we can certainly say that they all </v>

33
00:01:57.661 --> 00:01:59.580
<v Speaker 1>know ordinary country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

34
00:01:59.581 --> 00:02:00.414
<v Speaker 1>Canada is the second biggest country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the wells with its territory covering </v>

35
00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.790
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six different time zones and guess which</v>

36
00:02:05.791 --> 00:02:07.650
<v Speaker 1>country has the most coastline in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world?</v>

37
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:08.970
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no prizes,</v>

38
00:02:08.971 --> 00:02:11.380
<v Speaker 1>if you guessed Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course as well.</v>

39
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.770
<v Speaker 1>Regular visual politic view is already </v>
<v Speaker 1>known either the size of the country,</v>

40
00:02:14.771 --> 00:02:15.604
<v Speaker 1>surface and or its coastline determines </v>
<v Speaker 1>its wealth or how many opportunities </v>

41
00:02:19.351 --> 00:02:24.351
<v Speaker 1>it's citizens have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then what's really behind the success</v>

42
00:02:25.991 --> 00:02:27.010
<v Speaker 1>on Canada?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

43
00:02:27.011 --> 00:02:27.844
<v Speaker 1>one key factor here is the disastrous </v>
<v Speaker 1>years the Canada had in the late </v>

44
00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.350
<v Speaker 1>eighties and early nineties,</v>

45
00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:38.080
<v Speaker 3>Canada suffered economic stagnation and </v>
<v Speaker 3>several crises.</v>

46
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.300
<v Speaker 3>These were bad enough that in 1995,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Wall Street Journal called Canada,</v>

47
00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:44.223
<v Speaker 3>an honorary member of the third world </v>
<v Speaker 3>due to its inability to control </v>

48
00:02:48.191 --> 00:02:49.090
<v Speaker 3>government accounts.</v>

49
00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:53.890
<v Speaker 1>Things then as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have changed enormously.</v>

50
00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:54.753
<v Speaker 1>Canada really knew how to play to their </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengths and get rid of their </v>

51
00:02:57.431 --> 00:03:01.030
<v Speaker 1>weaknesses and especially the above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All Canadians have really understood the</v>

52
00:03:01.031 --> 00:03:04.060
<v Speaker 1>importance and the meaning of these two </v>
<v Speaker 1>words,</v>

53
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:05.043
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness and integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After those disastrous years of the </v>

54
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:11.134
<v Speaker 1>eighties and nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canadians realize that before thinking </v>

55
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.104
<v Speaker 1>about spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is absolutely essential to think </v>

56
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.810
<v Speaker 1>about creating and they realized that in</v>
<v Speaker 1>order to do that,</v>

57
00:03:19.811 --> 00:03:24.811
<v Speaker 1>they needed investment businesses and </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade a great deal of trade</v>

58
00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.160
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as it was said,</v>

59
00:03:33.161 --> 00:03:37.660
<v Speaker 1>so it was done in Canada is today these </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven freest economy in the world,</v>

60
00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:38.523
<v Speaker 1>but if we're talking about freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we can't just talk about the </v>

61
00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:42.183
<v Speaker 1>economic side of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Fraser Institute publishes every </v>

62
00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.783
<v Speaker 1>year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called the Human Freedom </v>

63
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.453
<v Speaker 1>Index.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This measures both the economic and the </v>

64
00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:52.300
<v Speaker 1>civil freedoms that people enjoy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quite simply,</v>

65
00:03:52.301 --> 00:03:53.134
<v Speaker 1>it measures what we can't do and what we</v>
<v Speaker 1>can't so well according to their </v>

66
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:59.860
<v Speaker 1>research.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada is the freest country on earth.</v>

67
00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.560
<v Speaker 1>To give you a better idea of how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>compares to some other countries.</v>

68
00:04:02.561 --> 00:04:03.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the USA,</v>

69
00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.840
<v Speaker 1>they ranked 23rd.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isn't,</v>

70
00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.740
<v Speaker 1>isn't it 28th and Japan is flagging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>position 32.</v>

71
00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.260
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the reason for this is these </v>
<v Speaker 1>strong decentralization that the country</v>

72
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:15.094
<v Speaker 1>has Canada instantly that into 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>provinces and three territories that </v>

73
00:04:18.341 --> 00:04:19.174
<v Speaker 1>have so many unique regulations that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 they actually had to sign a free </v>

74
00:04:23.021 --> 00:04:24.490
<v Speaker 1>trade agreement among them.</v>

75
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:30.220
<v Speaker 1>You interprovincial trade deal expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>to add billions to the economy.</v>

76
00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:31.273
<v Speaker 1>I think decentralization is absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>enormous and it is traditionally </v>

77
00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:38.620
<v Speaker 1>resulted in higher costs for those </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that don't operate in a single</v>

78
00:04:38.621 --> 00:04:39.454
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in several different regions with </v>

79
00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>each region having different </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>

80
00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:45.573
<v Speaker 1>In Ontario,</v>
<v Speaker 1>petrol must be at least five percent </v>

81
00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:48.753
<v Speaker 1>ethanol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Manitoba insists on an eight point five </v>

82
00:04:51.401 --> 00:04:52.234
<v Speaker 1>percent blend.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The positive side of this is that this </v>

83
00:04:54.221 --> 00:04:55.054
<v Speaker 1>has worked as a counterweight to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>federal governments and it's encouraged </v>

84
00:04:57.761 --> 00:04:58.594
<v Speaker 1>them to make pro citizen policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's something that has driven </v>

85
00:05:01.211 --> 00:05:02.044
<v Speaker 1>good public policies anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This new agreement has been created in </v>

86
00:05:04.541 --> 00:05:07.690
<v Speaker 1>order to beat all these surprising </v>
<v Speaker 1>obstacles further,</v>

87
00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:08.623
<v Speaker 1>as we talked about in a previous video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's also the Canadian bets on </v>

88
00:05:11.501 --> 00:05:14.690
<v Speaker 1>multiculturalism and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let us be relative frank here.</v>

89
00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:16.750
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country is one of the best examples</v>

90
00:05:16.751 --> 00:05:21.751
<v Speaker 1>of integration in the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but ah,</v>

91
00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:30.310
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian mosaic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also this Canadian multiculturalism.</v>

92
00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:32.350
<v Speaker 1>And what's it all really about?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:05:32.351 --> 00:05:36.550
<v Speaker 1>basically it consists of accepting that </v>
<v Speaker 1>cultural diversity is not a threat,</v>

94
00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.700
<v Speaker 1>but it's an asset and a source of </v>
<v Speaker 1>opportunities for a country.</v>

95
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:40.481
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

96
00:05:40.481 --> 00:05:44.320
<v Speaker 1>this multiculturalism is always </v>
<v Speaker 1>subordinate to a core set of values such</v>

97
00:05:44.321 --> 00:05:47.170
<v Speaker 1>as democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the rule of law and equality for</v>

98
00:05:47.171 --> 00:05:48.004
<v Speaker 1>all people.</v>

99
00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.910
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope.</v>

100
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.470
<v Speaker 1>This needs that in order to be Canadian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and be welcomed into their country,</v>

101
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:54.423
<v Speaker 1>you don't have to replace your culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>with any other like the Canadian </v>

102
00:05:57.471 --> 00:05:58.304
<v Speaker 1>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just have to accept and commit to </v>

103
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:02.780
<v Speaker 1>those core Canadian values.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

104
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.620
<v Speaker 1>Canada has one of the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations of immigrants in the world.</v>

105
00:06:06.621 --> 00:06:09.290
<v Speaker 1>One out of every five Canadians weren't </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in Canada.</v>

106
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:11.200
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for some cities like Toronto,</v>

107
00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.250
<v Speaker 1>this figure it grows up to 50 percent or</v>
<v Speaker 1>even higher and it seems that it will be</v>

108
00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.084
<v Speaker 1>even higher in the future because every </v>
<v Speaker 1>year more than 300,000 new immigrants </v>

109
00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:21.524
<v Speaker 1>come to this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is one of the highest immigration </v>

110
00:06:23.991 --> 00:06:26.330
<v Speaker 1>rates in the entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know,</v>

111
00:06:26.331 --> 00:06:28.190
<v Speaker 1>the result of all of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think is the problem?</v>

112
00:06:28.191 --> 00:06:28.701
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's.</v>

113
00:06:28.701 --> 00:06:30.950
<v Speaker 1>It's actually no problem at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

114
00:06:30.951 --> 00:06:31.784
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said in that previous video </v>

115
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:35.060
<v Speaker 1>integration in Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's certainly not for free.</v>

116
00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:38.600
<v Speaker 1>There's the system that exists that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>based on three fundamental pillars,</v>

117
00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:41.630
<v Speaker 1>points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>family reunification and refugees.</v>

118
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.520
<v Speaker 1>The most important one of these is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>points based system.</v>

119
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.880
<v Speaker 1>This exists do grants people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>residents or work permits.</v>

120
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>It considers things like having a job </v>
<v Speaker 1>offer,</v>

121
00:06:54.161 --> 00:06:54.994
<v Speaker 1>which is the most important thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or also maybe having a degree or having </v>

122
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:58.810
<v Speaker 1>the ability to speak</v>

123
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.490
<v Speaker 2>English and</v>

124
00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.680
<v Speaker 1>I know the results of these policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

125
00:07:03.681 --> 00:07:04.514
<v Speaker 1>almost 80 percent of Canadians think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that immigration is good for the </v>

126
00:07:07.011 --> 00:07:07.844
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that really shouldn't </v>

127
00:07:09.141 --> 00:07:13.250
<v Speaker 1>be so strange when you consider that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>the statistics show that immigrants,</v>

128
00:07:13.251 --> 00:07:15.950
<v Speaker 1>the brands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>new Canadians are more educated,</v>

129
00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:19.100
<v Speaker 1>they work more hours,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they create more businesses as they draw</v>

130
00:07:19.101 --> 00:07:22.490
<v Speaker 1>less dollars from social programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the question might be,</v>

131
00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:23.353
<v Speaker 1>does Canada have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>does it have any rules about </v>

132
00:07:24.771 --> 00:07:26.930
<v Speaker 1>immigration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Certainly it does,</v>

133
00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:30.080
<v Speaker 1>but this sort of welcoming culture </v>
<v Speaker 1>focused on integration.</v>

134
00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.250
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty Rad.</v>

135
00:07:36.130 --> 00:07:36.670
<v Speaker 2>Exactly.</v>

136
00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>77.</v>

137
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:42.690
<v Speaker 1>Every Canadian citizen can hold any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other nationality without restriction,</v>

138
00:07:42.721 --> 00:07:45.940
<v Speaker 1>so when someone immigrates to Canada </v>
<v Speaker 1>arounds after some years they can obtain</v>

139
00:07:45.941 --> 00:07:46.774
<v Speaker 1>the Canadian passport.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't have to renounce their </v>

140
00:07:48.641 --> 00:07:49.474
<v Speaker 1>previous nationality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if something might perfectly show </v>

141
00:07:52.241 --> 00:07:56.050
<v Speaker 1>Canada spirits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well that would be Prime Minister Justin</v>

142
00:07:56.050 --> 00:07:56.270
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau.</v>

143
00:07:56.270 --> 00:07:59.060
<v Speaker 3>Hi everyone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm Justin Trudeau.</v>

144
00:08:06.490 --> 00:08:07.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

145
00:08:08.330 --> 00:08:10.400
<v Speaker 3>Didn't Trudeau a political star?</v>

146
00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:13.773
<v Speaker 1>Didn't he die?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He took office in 2015 almost buying </v>

147
00:08:15.730 --> 00:08:18.730
<v Speaker 1>surprise and that just 44 years vein </v>
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>

148
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:22.510
<v Speaker 1>He is one of the most popular </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians in the world and that's true</v>

149
00:08:22.511 --> 00:08:25.060
<v Speaker 1>in Canada as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that the Poles</v>

150
00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:26.253
<v Speaker 3>clearly show a recent survey by abacus </v>
<v Speaker 3>data on the leadership of the prime </v>

151
00:08:30.731 --> 00:08:31.564
<v Speaker 3>minister shows that 70 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canadians are confident that Trudeau </v>

152
00:08:35.051 --> 00:08:38.800
<v Speaker 3>will successfully manage Canada's </v>
<v Speaker 3>relations with its allies.</v>

153
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.220
<v Speaker 3>Sixty three percent trust his </v>
<v Speaker 3>responsibility to make decisions,</v>

154
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:45.940
<v Speaker 3>and 62 percent believed that his </v>
<v Speaker 3>decisions will be good ones.</v>

155
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:47.463
<v Speaker 3>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 3>how many politicians around the world </v>

156
00:08:48.461 --> 00:08:51.230
<v Speaker 3>would really like approval?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Rating is like those.</v>

157
00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:54.400
<v Speaker 3>We need a leader.</v>
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>

158
00:08:54.450 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 3>Trudeau,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he's not a typical</v>

159
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:57.510
<v Speaker 1>politician,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

160
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:59.270
<v Speaker 1>The Prime Minister of Canada has </v>
<v Speaker 1>personal,</v>

161
00:08:59.271 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 1>a table,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a program,</v>

162
00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:01.393
<v Speaker 1>and the form of government that's really</v>
<v Speaker 1>quite different from what's typically </v>

163
00:09:04.261 --> 00:09:06.330
<v Speaker 1>being used and when you look at his </v>
<v Speaker 1>cabinet,</v>

164
00:09:06.331 --> 00:09:09.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a realistic sample of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada's reality.</v>

165
00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:12.210
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cabinet looks like Canada.</v>

166
00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:14.953
<v Speaker 3>10 of the 30 ministers are women.</v>
<v Speaker 3>There's even an Afghanistan veteran and </v>

167
00:09:18.741 --> 00:09:21.560
<v Speaker 3>an individual who is formerly a </v>
<v Speaker 3>volunteer in Niger.</v>

168
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:25.340
<v Speaker 3>There also business executives and even </v>
<v Speaker 3>some ministers who are Sikhs,</v>

169
00:09:25.341 --> 00:09:28.330
<v Speaker 3>which is a religion native to the Punjab</v>
<v Speaker 3>state in.</v>

170
00:09:28.530 --> 00:09:29.363
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

171
00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:32.860
<v Speaker 1>The latest addition to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they by the way,</v>

172
00:09:32.861 --> 00:09:36.820
<v Speaker 1>has been who sent a Somali,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who arrived to Canada as a refugee at 16</v>

173
00:09:36.821 --> 00:09:39.910
<v Speaker 1>years old and is now the minister of </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>

174
00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Pretty amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

175
00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:41.943
<v Speaker 1>today's political priorities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well there is international as these </v>

176
00:09:43.971 --> 00:09:44.804
<v Speaker 1>cabinets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the government of Canada is key </v>

177
00:09:45.941 --> 00:09:48.550
<v Speaker 1>challenges is to boost trade among </v>
<v Speaker 1>nations.</v>

178
00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:50.690
<v Speaker 1>Now pay attention to that foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>affairs,</v>

179
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:53.220
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

180
00:09:53.220 --> 00:09:54.053
<v Speaker 3>Trade barriers hurt the people.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They are intended to help the curb </v>

181
00:09:57.001 --> 00:09:59.940
<v Speaker 3>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 3>stifle innovation and kill employment.</v>

182
00:09:59.970 --> 00:10:02.820
<v Speaker 3>This is a lesson we should learn from </v>
<v Speaker 3>history.</v>

183
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:07.230
<v Speaker 1>This is why Trudeau wants to sign a free</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade agreements with China.</v>

184
00:10:07.260 --> 00:10:09.270
<v Speaker 1>Secondly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike other governments to do,</v>

185
00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:10.143
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just reject protectionism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he wants to stimulate a productive </v>

186
00:10:13.771 --> 00:10:16.410
<v Speaker 1>change with artificial intelligence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>automation.</v>

187
00:10:16.440 --> 00:10:17.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean why you can do technology if </v>
<v Speaker 1>there's something we've seen as history </v>

188
00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:21.023
<v Speaker 1>has progressed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that technology improves people's </v>

189
00:10:23.071 --> 00:10:25.130
<v Speaker 1>lives and to create some more jobs.</v>

190
00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:32.240
<v Speaker 1>Not seeing something like that is too </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated to do,</v>

191
00:10:32.241 --> 00:10:33.074
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that there are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>many world leaders who defend this pro </v>

192
00:10:35.931 --> 00:10:38.900
<v Speaker 1>technology position talking about jobs </v>
<v Speaker 1>going away.</v>

193
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:40.003
<v Speaker 1>It's not exactly a popular line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other great challenge and maybe the </v>

194
00:10:42.591 --> 00:10:43.424
<v Speaker 1>key value of Trudeau's government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that bets on boosting civil rights and </v>

195
00:10:46.581 --> 00:10:50.540
<v Speaker 1>sending Canada into an international </v>
<v Speaker 1>example of how this should be done.</v>

196
00:10:50.570 --> 00:10:52.700
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at the power of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>

197
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:57.880
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau has become the first prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister to lead an Lgbtq pride parade.</v>

198
00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:00.320
<v Speaker 1>There's also the most recently released </v>
<v Speaker 1>program,</v>

199
00:11:00.330 --> 00:11:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Canada's feminist international </v>
<v Speaker 1>assistance policy.</v>

200
00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:04.161
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right.</v>

201
00:11:04.161 --> 00:11:04.994
<v Speaker 1>Trudeau's government didn't hesitate to </v>
<v Speaker 1>declare itself feminist and among other </v>

202
00:11:07.851 --> 00:11:08.684
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have decided to do focus and most </v>

203
00:11:09.741 --> 00:11:10.574
<v Speaker 1>of their international cooperation </v>
<v Speaker 1>budgets on pushing winans rights where </v>

204
00:11:13.341 --> 00:11:15.500
<v Speaker 1>they are most needed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no this,</v>

205
00:11:15.501 --> 00:11:16.334
<v Speaker 1>it's just a symbol,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but sometimes symbols that pretty </v>

206
00:11:18.321 --> 00:11:19.154
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other symbols and gestures are is </v>

207
00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:25.400
<v Speaker 1>positioned towards Syrian refugees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>pay close attention to this speech.</v>

208
00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.333
<v Speaker 4>In recent months,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Canadians have opened their hearts and </v>

209
00:11:29.191 --> 00:11:30.024
<v Speaker 4>their arms to families fleeing the </v>
<v Speaker 4>ongoing conflict in Syria and from the </v>

210
00:11:33.811 --> 00:11:34.644
<v Speaker 4>moment they arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 4>those 31,000 refugees were welcomed not </v>

211
00:11:38.431 --> 00:11:41.820
<v Speaker 4>as burdens,</v>
<v Speaker 4>but as neighbors and friends.</v>

212
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:43.440
<v Speaker 4>As new Canadian</v>

213
00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.090
<v Speaker 2>today state</v>

214
00:11:45.260 --> 00:11:48.500
<v Speaker 3>40,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada.</v>

215
00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:49.393
<v Speaker 3>Almost half of them,</v>
<v Speaker 3>thanks to the sponsorship of Canadian </v>

216
00:11:51.411 --> 00:11:54.040
<v Speaker 3>citizens had committed to be responsible</v>

217
00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:59.040
<v Speaker 1>and looking after their wellness.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a great example of solidarity.</v>

218
00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:00.903
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's one thing being kind and generous </v>

219
00:12:02.861 --> 00:12:03.490
<v Speaker 1>and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

220
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.940
<v Speaker 1>it's quite another to be naive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bus consider this.</v>

221
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:07.803
<v Speaker 1>The Canadian government has announced </v>
<v Speaker 1>its intention to increase military </v>

222
00:12:10.121 --> 00:12:13.420
<v Speaker 1>spending by more than 70 percent from </v>
<v Speaker 1>now until 20,</v>

223
00:12:13.421 --> 00:12:17.770
<v Speaker 1>24 in order to create a more agile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>modern armed forces.</v>

224
00:12:17.780 --> 00:12:18.613
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

225
00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:24.730
<v Speaker 1>Trains,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doors open to technology integration,</v>

226
00:12:24.731 --> 00:12:26.110
<v Speaker 1>civil rights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>

227
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.090
<v Speaker 1>all these things don't sound bad at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

228
00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.093
<v Speaker 1>Especially if you consider that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>government understands that before </v>

229
00:12:32.561 --> 00:12:36.880
<v Speaker 1>starting to discuss spending,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to talk about wealth creation.</v>

230
00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:38.950
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean that's how Canada has reached its</v>

231
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:41.500
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 50th anniversary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything.</v>

232
00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:42.850
<v Speaker 1>Bloody Marvelous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

233
00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:44.290
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait a second.</v>

234
00:12:44.291 --> 00:12:45.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean not exactly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

235
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:46.483
<v Speaker 1>there are certainly some shadows,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're actually gonna have to leave </v>

236
00:12:48.881 --> 00:12:49.714
<v Speaker 1>those for another video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something we're probably going to call </v>
