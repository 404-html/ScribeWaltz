00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible],</v>

2
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:09.620
<v Speaker 2>Venezuelan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as long game of thrones,</v>

3
00:00:09.621 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 2>we all want to know how it's going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>ends,</v>

4
00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.943
<v Speaker 2>but at the same time we all know that </v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to be disappointed with the </v>

5
00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:18.770
<v Speaker 2>ending and this is exactly what are we </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to be talking about today.</v>

6
00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.720
<v Speaker 2>Many of you have the same question in </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind.</v>

7
00:00:20.721 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 2>How can the Venezuelan crisis and yeah,</v>

8
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.533
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about one of the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial and humanitarian catastrophes </v>

9
00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:34.603
<v Speaker 2>in modern history in just 10 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>they've gone from exporting oil to </v>

10
00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.480
<v Speaker 2>exporting refugees,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but you already knew this.</v>

11
00:00:41.481 --> 00:00:45.470
<v Speaker 2>We've got several videos here on visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic that cover this very issue.</v>

12
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.363
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela is not the only country that </v>

13
00:00:47.601 --> 00:00:48.434
<v Speaker 2>has gone completely bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You also have the example of Nicaragua </v>

14
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.600
<v Speaker 2>during the 1980s Nicaragua suffered from</v>
<v Speaker 2>hyperinflation,</v>

15
00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:58.400
<v Speaker 2>scarcity of resources and extreme </v>
<v Speaker 2>poverty as well,</v>

16
00:00:58.401 --> 00:00:59.234
<v Speaker 2>but in that case there was a clear </v>
<v Speaker 2>alternative to power and it was easy to </v>

17
00:01:02.811 --> 00:01:04.530
<v Speaker 2>figure out what could happen there.</v>

18
00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela instead is a big time mystery.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>

19
00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.990
<v Speaker 2>The Venezuelan president,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicolas Maduro is up against the wall.</v>

20
00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.943
<v Speaker 2>As we said in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He even came up with his own </v>

21
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:21.283
<v Speaker 2>cryptocurrency,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the petro as a desperate attempt to get </v>

22
00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:26.380
<v Speaker 2>some foreign currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If things keep going this way,</v>

23
00:01:26.381 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 2>he won't even have the money to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 2>army.</v>

24
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.680
<v Speaker 2>That keeps them empower.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But this is not the worst problem.</v>

25
00:01:32.681 --> 00:01:37.681
<v Speaker 2>The real mystery of oven is wheeler is </v>
<v Speaker 2>who is the alternative is they're really</v>

26
00:01:38.141 --> 00:01:40.900
<v Speaker 2>somebody who can substitute Maduro's </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule,</v>

27
00:01:40.901 --> 00:01:41.734
<v Speaker 2>somebody with enough political capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>to change things in this country and </v>

28
00:01:45.191 --> 00:01:50.191
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So far summary,</v>

29
00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:53.294
<v Speaker 2>it is almost impossible to understand is</v>
<v Speaker 2>the current political situation in </v>

30
00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:57.263
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then this is why we wanted to talk </v>

31
00:01:58.461 --> 00:01:59.294
<v Speaker 2>to one of the world's largest experts in</v>
<v Speaker 2>political transitions and you might </v>

32
00:02:02.421 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

33
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.913
<v Speaker 2>who are we talking about here in a story</v>
<v Speaker 2>in from a think tank and economist </v>

34
00:02:07.041 --> 00:02:07.760
<v Speaker 2>maybe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.593
<v Speaker 2>we've got someone way better if I'm </v>
<v Speaker 2>headed up was the finance minister of </v>

36
00:02:11.631 --> 00:02:14.870
<v Speaker 2>the Czech Republic during the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>years after the fall of communism.</v>

37
00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:23.440
<v Speaker 2>He is one of the architects of the Czech</v>
<v Speaker 2>Republic as it exists today,</v>

38
00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.453
<v Speaker 2>but this is not the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 2>After having a remarkable political </v>

39
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:30.550
<v Speaker 2>career,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started a business in South America.</v>

40
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.510
<v Speaker 2>This means he knows this region as well </v>
<v Speaker 2>as the palm of his hands.</v>

41
00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.910
<v Speaker 2>And with that said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me introduce you to him.</v>

42
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.410
<v Speaker 3>Hello to all the visual poetic </v>
<v Speaker 3>subscribers.</v>

<v Speaker 3>Simon,</v>

44
00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.730
<v Speaker 3>it's just impossible to imagine what </v>
<v Speaker 3>could actually happen in ministry.</v>

45
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

46
00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.750
<v Speaker 3>today we are going to draw three </v>
<v Speaker 3>different or things show scenarios based</v>

47
00:02:56.661 --> 00:02:59.860
<v Speaker 3>on the recent history.</v>
<v Speaker 3>So today's question is what can happen</v>

48
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:00.813
<v Speaker 2>in Venezuela?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What potential scenarios can we foresee </v>

49
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.380
<v Speaker 2>in this country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to answer these questions,</v>

50
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:08.340
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the history.</v>

51
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:13.633
<v Speaker 1>Correct</v>

<v Speaker 2>influence on the history of a country </v>

54
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.590
<v Speaker 2>than him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He must lizard be achieved.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Thanks to Vat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Slav Harwell and believe me,</v>

58
00:03:36.481 --> 00:03:40.170
<v Speaker 2>this is a big success story for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>democratic transition.</v>

59
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.153
<v Speaker 2>While other countries like Russia or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine are still poor and unequal </v>

60
00:03:44.221 --> 00:03:46.500
<v Speaker 2>societies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Czech Republic is prosperous,</v>

61
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.140
<v Speaker 2>modern.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And surprisingly egalitarian,</v>

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.003
<v Speaker 2>they have low unemployment,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thriving middle class and it's the </v>

63
00:03:51.781 --> 00:03:55.860
<v Speaker 2>political rights of any other European </v>
<v Speaker 2>country that well,</v>

<v Speaker 3>you will need a special permits is with </v>

<v Speaker 3>checks even though it's trying to cross </v>

74
00:04:33.861 --> 00:04:36.680
<v Speaker 3>the Polish border so they could buy </v>
<v Speaker 3>books.</v>

75
00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:39.800
<v Speaker 3>It pigeon in Czechoslovakia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time</v>

76
00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:40.743
<v Speaker 2>nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything changed at the end of the </v>

77
00:04:42.521 --> 00:04:43.450
<v Speaker 2>1980s</v>

78
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:44.373
<v Speaker 3>you,</v>
<v Speaker 3>us though we never had the </v>

79
00:04:44.911 --> 00:04:48.450
<v Speaker 3>hyperinflation to heaven.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Banish valid today.</v>

80
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.090
<v Speaker 3>We did suffer scar seats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Did you want to buy a car?</v>

81
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.540
<v Speaker 3>You had to have faith for years onto the</v>
<v Speaker 3>state.</v>

82
00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 3>Urgh factory would send your basic </v>
<v Speaker 3>things like bananas but a luxury.</v>

83
00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.820
<v Speaker 3>It was impossible to find in most of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>shops,</v>

84
00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:03.983
<v Speaker 3>maybe with exception of Christmas.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The same happened with most of the </v>

85
00:05:07.621 --> 00:05:11.670
<v Speaker 3>fruits and vegetables,</v>
<v Speaker 3>meats at many different other products</v>

86
00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.863
<v Speaker 2>add to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that the Soviet Union couldn't </v>

87
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:19.144
<v Speaker 2>send money to that allies anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with no foreign support in the </v>

88
00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:22.563
<v Speaker 2>bankrupt economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's normal to have all kinds of </v>

89
00:05:24.851 --> 00:05:26.200
<v Speaker 2>protests.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

90
00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:29.330
<v Speaker 2>that first police suppress the protests </v>
<v Speaker 2>against hossack.</v>

91
00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.830
<v Speaker 2>Raul,</v>

92
00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.440
<v Speaker 3>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>on the first stage,</v>

93
00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:35.370
<v Speaker 3>Balistreri brands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the protest a cane Zulu sat through.</v>

94
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.490
<v Speaker 3>But what happens when all of a sudden </v>
<v Speaker 3>you have more than 250,000</v>

95
00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.903
<v Speaker 3>people in the streets of Brac?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You gotta be crazy to start shooting </v>

96
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:52.310
<v Speaker 3>quarter of million beads.</v>

97
00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:53.143
<v Speaker 2>Nicolas Maduro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Czechoslovakia and government </v>

98
00:05:54.831 --> 00:05:55.664
<v Speaker 2>understood that the best thing they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do with step down from power in a </v>

99
00:05:59.181 --> 00:06:00.014
<v Speaker 2>peaceful fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to this Gustaf who sank it got </v>

100
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.743
<v Speaker 2>his golden retirement and the check </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolution was known as the velvet </v>

101
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:08.840
<v Speaker 2>revolution because no blood was spilled.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

102
00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:09.674
<v Speaker 2>as I said at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to this process was the </v>

103
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:15.380
<v Speaker 2>prominent figure of Vaslav Harville.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was a famous writer back then,</v>

104
00:06:15.381 --> 00:06:18.920
<v Speaker 2>and so he managed to capitalize on all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the political unrest.</v>

105
00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:22.523
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

106
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.320
<v Speaker 2>And love will overcome lies and hate.</v>

107
00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:28.240
<v Speaker 3>True Fuss.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Love Harvard Bachelor.</v>

108
00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.103
<v Speaker 3>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we'll slot schooler known before and </v>

109
00:06:30.641 --> 00:06:31.474
<v Speaker 3>with all the tribulation came up,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but he had all the elements to become a </v>

110
00:06:34.871 --> 00:06:35.620
<v Speaker 3>good leader.</v>

111
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.453
<v Speaker 2>The question now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is that any Venezuelan vaults love </v>

112
00:06:38.981 --> 00:06:39.814
<v Speaker 2>Harwell,</v>
<v Speaker 2>maybe somebody we don't know that could </v>

113
00:06:41.861 --> 00:06:44.740
<v Speaker 2>emerge as a charismatic leader able to </v>
<v Speaker 2>change everything.</v>

114
00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:45.723
<v Speaker 2>The answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately that we don't know and </v>

115
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.143
<v Speaker 2>this is why we should talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>more pessimistic scenario manian way </v>

116
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.743
<v Speaker 2>out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What happens when a dictator doesn't </v>

117
00:06:59.281 --> 00:07:00.114
<v Speaker 2>want to leave power,</v>
<v Speaker 2>even if the situation is getting out of </v>

118
00:07:02.011 --> 00:07:03.780
<v Speaker 2>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you right now,</v>

119
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:06.150
<v Speaker 2>it's nothing good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We've said it before here.</v>

120
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:07.950
<v Speaker 2>A visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite how it looks,</v>

121
00:07:07.951 --> 00:07:11.040
<v Speaker 2>being an authoritarian ruler is a risky </v>
<v Speaker 2>job.</v>

122
00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:14.120
<v Speaker 3>Glass Churches,</v>
<v Speaker 3>school is the best proof of this.</v>

123
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:14.811
<v Speaker 3>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 3>choking.</v>

124
00:07:14.811 --> 00:07:18.230
<v Speaker 3>Get both of them.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The most brutal dictators we ever had.</v>

125
00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:29.450
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

126
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:34.893
<v Speaker 3>I like Nicolas Maduro equal ass jokes.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He didn't even care about pretending to </v>

127
00:07:38.921 --> 00:07:39.754
<v Speaker 3>organize elections.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was a system based on the cult of </v>

128
00:07:42.581 --> 00:07:43.414
<v Speaker 3>personality,</v>

129
00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.470
<v Speaker 2>but you know when the economy goes </v>
<v Speaker 2>south,</v>

130
00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:48.830
<v Speaker 2>even Europe's most authoritarians </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator has problems.</v>

131
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:50.630
<v Speaker 2>Just like the rest of the communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

132
00:07:50.631 --> 00:07:55.280
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the 1980s Romania was at </v>
<v Speaker 2>the edge of bankruptcy in some regions.</v>

133
00:07:55.281 --> 00:07:58.070
<v Speaker 2>They even had kids with malnutrition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

134
00:07:58.071 --> 00:08:01.370
<v Speaker 2>on December the 25th 1989 after giving a</v>
<v Speaker 2>massive speech,</v>

135
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:02.293
<v Speaker 2>the citizens went from clapping their </v>
<v Speaker 2>hands to booing him in a matter of </v>

136
00:08:05.331 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 2>seconds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Days later,</v>

137
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:11.120
<v Speaker 2>the Romanian equivalent of Kim Jong Uhmm</v>
<v Speaker 2>was executed by his people.</v>

138
00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:19.160
<v Speaker 1>Aye.</v>

139
00:08:29.150 --> 00:08:32.600
<v Speaker 3>Beyond nuts talking about a revolution </v>
<v Speaker 3>against the regime.</v>

140
00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.870
<v Speaker 3>He was not even killed by county </v>
<v Speaker 3>humanist activists.</v>

141
00:08:35.930 --> 00:08:36.763
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>vouchers school was executed by the </v>

142
00:08:38.841 --> 00:08:43.210
<v Speaker 3>members of his own party.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It was kind of injuring Gudetama,</v>

143
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.353
<v Speaker 3>the moderate faction of the Romanian </v>
<v Speaker 3>Communist Party do to control of the </v>

144
00:08:48.081 --> 00:08:48.950
<v Speaker 3>Romanian government.</v>

145
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.103
<v Speaker 2>In the case of Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this good be a faction of his own </v>

146
00:08:52.601 --> 00:08:54.250
<v Speaker 2>governments or the army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

147
00:08:54.251 --> 00:08:56.400
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have to finish the execution </v>
<v Speaker 2>of anybody.</v>

148
00:08:56.401 --> 00:08:59.370
<v Speaker 2>They could just kick him out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country and you could end up living in a</v>

149
00:08:59.371 --> 00:09:01.620
<v Speaker 2>mansion and any other nation that would </v>
<v Speaker 2>accept him.</v>

150
00:09:01.800 --> 00:09:02.633
<v Speaker 2>It wouldn't be the first time this has </v>
<v Speaker 2>happened and it certainly won't be the </v>

151
00:09:04.951 --> 00:09:05.784
<v Speaker 2>last but just like in Romania,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the changes in government would it be </v>

152
00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:12.450
<v Speaker 2>pure lip service,</v>
<v Speaker 2>different faces but at the same values,</v>

153
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:15.870
<v Speaker 2>the same policies although perhaps a </v>
<v Speaker 2>little more moderate.</v>

154
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:17.770
<v Speaker 3>Well at this school year to do these </v>
<v Speaker 3>Romania,</v>

155
00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:18.903
<v Speaker 3>he's not a special example of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>transition but at least now we have a </v>

156
00:09:22.181 --> 00:09:25.930
<v Speaker 3>stable carpentry with some economic </v>
<v Speaker 3>movement and growth and the reason I was</v>

157
00:09:25.931 --> 00:09:30.870
<v Speaker 3>extreme poverty anymore and there are </v>
<v Speaker 3>opportunities in the for of future form</v>

158
00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:40.730
<v Speaker 2>and I do now have to make a a serious </v>
<v Speaker 2>and important decides.</v>

159
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:41.883
<v Speaker 2>I want to be really clear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not wishing any personal harm on </v>

160
00:09:44.651 --> 00:09:48.520
<v Speaker 2>Nicolas Maduro or anyone from his </v>
<v Speaker 2>government here are visual politic.</v>

161
00:09:48.521 --> 00:09:51.910
<v Speaker 2>We would never advocate for any kind of </v>
<v Speaker 2>violence in this video.</v>

162
00:09:51.911 --> 00:09:56.080
<v Speaker 2>We're simply exploring potential </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenarios that might or might not happen</v>

163
00:09:56.110 --> 00:09:59.830
<v Speaker 2>based on previous occurrences and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>really is all that said.</v>

164
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.040
<v Speaker 2>This Romanian way out doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 2>likely to happen either.</v>

165
00:10:03.130 --> 00:10:06.400
<v Speaker 2>That is why we will focus on the latest </v>
<v Speaker 2>possible scenario.</v>

166
00:10:06.401 --> 00:10:07.234
<v Speaker 2>Something that might sound at surreal,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but everything seems to be possible in </v>

167
00:10:10.961 --> 00:10:11.794
<v Speaker 2>fairness way</v>

168
00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.310
<v Speaker 2>a country for sale that Chinese way out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this other video,</v>

169
00:10:21.311 --> 00:10:25.900
<v Speaker 2>we explained to you why China is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>only strong ally left of Venezuela.</v>

170
00:10:26.040 --> 00:10:26.873
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that China has lens more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than $60 billion to Madurai as </v>

171
00:10:30.911 --> 00:10:31.744
<v Speaker 2>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Much of this credit comes in what we </v>

172
00:10:33.251 --> 00:10:34.084
<v Speaker 2>call oil loans.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's means China gives money to </v>

173
00:10:35.951 --> 00:10:38.200
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela and Venezuela instead of </v>
<v Speaker 2>giving back.</v>

174
00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:42.130
<v Speaker 2>Hard currency gives oil barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this makes sense,</v>

175
00:10:42.131 --> 00:10:44.440
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>If there was something abundance in this</v>

176
00:10:44.441 --> 00:10:45.274
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would certainly be it's dinosaur </v>

177
00:10:46.991 --> 00:10:47.950
<v Speaker 2>juice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

178
00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:52.810
<v Speaker 2>they have the world's biggest reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it seems to be a pretty good deal for</v>

179
00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.070
<v Speaker 2>the Douro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

180
00:10:59.590 --> 00:11:00.423
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is a problem here because as you </v>

181
00:11:02.561 --> 00:11:03.394
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA has a </v>

182
00:11:05.741 --> 00:11:06.574
<v Speaker 2>big crisis too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is more expensive to drill and </v>

183
00:11:08.921 --> 00:11:12.430
<v Speaker 2>extract oil in Venezuela than in any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other country,</v>

184
00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:13.293
<v Speaker 2>including Norway and Canada.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This explains why p Dvsa can no longer </v>

185
00:11:16.901 --> 00:11:21.901
<v Speaker 2>extract that own resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This company is producing of just 43% of</v>

186
00:11:21.941 --> 00:11:25.480
<v Speaker 2>their capacity and it's getting lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>and lower.</v>

187
00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:26.423
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>many Chinese investors are losing their </v>

188
00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:28.920
<v Speaker 3>patients.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Don't forget,</v>

189
00:11:28.921 --> 00:11:31.860
<v Speaker 3>we are not only talking about </v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] being government here.</v>

190
00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.150
<v Speaker 3>There are many private companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>involved here,</v>

191
00:11:34.320 --> 00:11:39.320
<v Speaker 3>companies that both have an Israeli in </v>
<v Speaker 3>debt bonds or firms that hidden stake on</v>

192
00:11:39.781 --> 00:11:43.500
<v Speaker 3>of an Israelian industry.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is why we can find use languages</v>

193
00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.353
<v Speaker 2>trying to see no peck,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sue's Venezuela in sign of fraying </v>

194
00:11:50.911 --> 00:11:52.860
<v Speaker 2>relations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question now,</v>

195
00:11:52.861 --> 00:11:53.694
<v Speaker 2>the real question is what would happen </v>
<v Speaker 2>in Venezuela if they can't give back </v>

196
00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.770
<v Speaker 2>those Chinese loans?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

197
00:11:59.771 --> 00:12:03.250
<v Speaker 2>a default is unlikely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>China is paying for the military and the</v>

198
00:12:03.251 --> 00:12:07.030
<v Speaker 2>police of Maduro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that at any moment they could</v>

199
00:12:07.031 --> 00:12:10.870
<v Speaker 2>simply shut down the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what could they do instead?</v>

200
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.793
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could seize pdv essay properties </v>

201
00:12:13.151 --> 00:12:17.460
<v Speaker 2>and these might have viewers are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>crown jewels of this coming,</v>

202
00:12:17.810 --> 00:12:18.643
<v Speaker 1>trey,</v>

203
00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:23.870
<v Speaker 3>Brian,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you bet.</v>

204
00:12:23.871 --> 00:12:24.704
<v Speaker 3>We are saying,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it is a board of managers could do </v>

205
00:12:27.361 --> 00:12:31.240
<v Speaker 3>the necessary font so the company can go</v>
<v Speaker 3>back to work normally.</v>

206
00:12:31.390 --> 00:12:32.223
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today if you DVSA assets are worth $230 </v>

207
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:36.183
<v Speaker 2>billion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maduro owes Xi Jingping more than $60 </v>

208
00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:39.851
<v Speaker 2>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

209
00:12:39.851 --> 00:12:43.570
<v Speaker 2>Beijing could be entitled to seize a </v>
<v Speaker 2>forth of PTV essays,</v>

210
00:12:43.571 --> 00:12:44.404
<v Speaker 2>assets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and don't forget that pdv essay is the </v>

211
00:12:46.091 --> 00:12:48.460
<v Speaker 2>biggest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if not the only company in Venezuela.</v>

212
00:12:48.640 --> 00:12:53.110
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget here that their dinosaur </v>
<v Speaker 2>juice is 97% of their export,</v>

213
00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.473
<v Speaker 2>say only lean.</v>
<v Speaker 2>PDV I say is sort of the same as owning </v>

214
00:13:01.341 --> 00:13:02.810
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela as a whole.</v>

215
00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:03.641
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I didn't bring simple,</v>

216
00:13:03.641 --> 00:13:04.474
<v Speaker 3>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this would be good for good use for </v>

217
00:13:05.790 --> 00:13:09.520
<v Speaker 3>veneers,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it would immobilize because Maduro's</v>

218
00:13:09.521 --> 00:13:10.331
<v Speaker 3>government.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

219
00:13:10.331 --> 00:13:11.164
<v Speaker 3>the words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it would be like selling Jehovah </v>

220
00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.040
<v Speaker 3>mcconnachie to the Chinese universities.</v>

221
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:21.150
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

222
00:13:21.151 --> 00:13:22.800
<v Speaker 2>so I know what you're all thinking right</v>
<v Speaker 2>now.</v>

223
00:13:22.801 --> 00:13:24.300
<v Speaker 2>You're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on Simon,</v>

224
00:13:24.301 --> 00:13:26.940
<v Speaker 2>this is science fiction.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It can't actually happen.</v>

225
00:13:27.180 --> 00:13:28.013
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let me tell you that there are already </v>

226
00:13:29.610 --> 00:13:31.650
<v Speaker 2>signs that something like this could </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen.</v>

227
00:13:31.830 --> 00:13:34.770
<v Speaker 2>Just look at the news published in Shane</v>
<v Speaker 2>Choir News,</v>

228
00:13:34.860 --> 00:13:36.600
<v Speaker 2>as you probably guessed by the name </v>
<v Speaker 2>shake.</v>

229
00:13:36.601 --> 00:13:41.250
<v Speaker 2>One News is a Chinese news sites that </v>
<v Speaker 2>follows Tszujing pings views have a look</v>

230
00:13:41.251 --> 00:13:42.084
<v Speaker 2>at this.</v>

231
00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.620
<v Speaker 2>Judo creates Venezuela's first petro </v>
<v Speaker 2>special economic zone.</v>

232
00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:54.340
<v Speaker 2>Anytime China wants to do big business </v>
<v Speaker 2>with a poorer country,</v>

233
00:13:54.341 --> 00:13:57.640
<v Speaker 2>the first thing they do is create a </v>
<v Speaker 2>special economic zone,</v>

234
00:13:57.641 --> 00:13:58.474
<v Speaker 2>an area with special laws based on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese regulations and low taxes for </v>

235
00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.060
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But in this case,</v>

236
00:14:04.090 --> 00:14:04.923
<v Speaker 2>this could even go further.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not talking about investing in a </v>

237
00:14:08.171 --> 00:14:12.260
<v Speaker 2>country or doing business.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are talking about buying the backbone</v>

238
00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:16.060
<v Speaker 2>of the Bolivarian Revolution here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Without pd Vsa,</v>

239
00:14:16.060 --> 00:14:19.690
<v Speaker 2>Maduro is like a hip hop artist without </v>
<v Speaker 2>the bling bling chains.</v>

240
00:14:19.750 --> 00:14:22.090
<v Speaker 2>So if you can control the economy of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

241
00:14:22.091 --> 00:14:24.130
<v Speaker 2>including the way that it gets its </v>
<v Speaker 2>finances,</v>

242
00:14:24.250 --> 00:14:27.640
<v Speaker 2>couldn't we say that you've sort of </v>
<v Speaker 2>already bought it?</v>

243
00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:28.533
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is what could end up happening in </v>

244
00:14:29.501 --> 00:14:30.334
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It will be one of the first times in </v>

245
00:14:31.931 --> 00:14:34.930
<v Speaker 2>history where our whole nation is sold.</v>

246
00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:40.600
<v Speaker 1>Perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

247
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.300
<v Speaker 2>this is really hard to conceive,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but as I've already said,</v>

248
00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:47.910
<v Speaker 2>everything is possible in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but now,</v>

249
00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:48.773
<v Speaker 2>well it's your 10 which of these three </v>
<v Speaker 2>scenarios is more to happen or do you </v>

250
00:14:52.341 --> 00:14:54.890
<v Speaker 2>think we'll see a mixture of all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>them?</v>

251
