00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.013
<v Speaker 1>Just before we get into the video today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you want to say that I recently </v>

2
00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:12.800
<v Speaker 1>started a new channel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's called biographics.</v>

3
00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:13.663
<v Speaker 1>We do long form,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20 minutes ish biographies of people </v>

4
00:00:16.221 --> 00:00:18.590
<v Speaker 1>from history as well as the present day </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

5
00:00:18.591 --> 00:00:19.424
<v Speaker 1>but a whole lot else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please check out the link in the </v>

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.750
<v Speaker 1>striction below and if you'd like </v>
<v Speaker 1>biographics please subscribe anyway.</v>

7
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:25.790
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everybody has their eyes on North Korea,</v>

8
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.000
<v Speaker 1>not their nuclear programs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still worries those in the White House.</v>

9
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 1>That is the nuclear program of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic Republic of Iran.</v>

10
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.930
<v Speaker 1>This country has such a bad reputation </v>
<v Speaker 1>that when we talk about it,</v>

11
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:39.764
<v Speaker 1>it can feel like we're talking about one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of those places that only exists in the </v>

12
00:00:42.651 --> 00:00:45.410
<v Speaker 1>movies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of those countries dominated by evil</v>

13
00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.110
<v Speaker 1>leaders who dream of destroying the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

14
00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.973
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that might actually be some truth to </v>

15
00:00:50.421 --> 00:00:51.254
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but definitely not as much as some </v>

16
00:00:52.971 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>seemed thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

17
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.190
<v Speaker 1>Iran is not the most religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not the most authoritarian and it's</v>

18
00:00:58.191 --> 00:00:59.024
<v Speaker 1>not even the most hostile place towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>women in this part of the world because </v>

19
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:04.880
<v Speaker 1>we have Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is far,</v>

20
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:06.300
<v Speaker 1>far worse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dev,</v>

21
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>you have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran is a country of contradictions,</v>

22
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:12.200
<v Speaker 1>a country whose government claims to </v>
<v Speaker 1>work under a democratic system,</v>

23
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.350
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time everything is under</v>
<v Speaker 1>the control of one man.</v>

24
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:16.213
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

25
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.510
<v Speaker 1>That man would be allie harmony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the supremes.</v>

26
00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.083
<v Speaker 1>At first glance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he isn't as scary as its predecessor </v>

27
00:01:28.581 --> 00:01:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Ruhollah Khomeini,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who was scary.</v>

28
00:01:30.771 --> 00:01:35.090
<v Speaker 1>Just have look at the truth is how many </v>
<v Speaker 1>econ stand anything modern for him?</v>

29
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:35.943
<v Speaker 1>Modality might as well have come from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Satan himself except for nuclear </v>

30
00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:40.220
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

31
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.400
<v Speaker 1>explains why in the past few years </v>
<v Speaker 1>around has been famous for two things.</v>

32
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.263
<v Speaker 1>Number one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>being one of the country's alongside </v>

33
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.440
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where the most people are executed every</v>

34
00:01:54.441 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>year and number two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wanting to build their own nuclear bomb.</v>

35
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.473
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike what has happened with the North </v>

36
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.620
<v Speaker 1>Korean crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US and Iran,</v>

37
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.970
<v Speaker 1>they did reach an agreement.</v>

38
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.823
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

39
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.503
<v Speaker 1>In 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>President Obama led the joint </v>

40
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.293
<v Speaker 1>comprehensive plan of action and </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements to prevent Iran from </v>

41
00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.653
<v Speaker 1>obtaining a nuclear bomb as an agreement</v>
<v Speaker 1>to this many of considered to be one of </v>

42
00:02:17.421 --> 00:02:20.450
<v Speaker 1>the greatest achievements in all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy.</v>

43
00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.393
<v Speaker 3>It's now more than 50 years since </v>
<v Speaker 3>President Kennedy stood before the </v>

44
00:02:23.861 --> 00:02:27.910
<v Speaker 3>American people and said,</v>
<v Speaker 3>let us never negotiate out of fear,</v>

45
00:02:27.911 --> 00:02:30.070
<v Speaker 3>but let us never fear to negotiate.</v>

46
00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.073
<v Speaker 1>Although to Fab all signs seem to point </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the conclusion that this agreement </v>

47
00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 1>has not kept either party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saturday presidents of the United States</v>

48
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:41.084
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is pretty clear about his </v>

49
00:02:42.621 --> 00:02:44.960
<v Speaker 1>opinion on the deal ever since he was a </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate.</v>

50
00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.823
<v Speaker 1>He has described it as the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement ever negotiated during his </v>

51
00:02:49.551 --> 00:02:51.380
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has vowed on many,</v>

52
00:02:51.381 --> 00:02:52.214
<v Speaker 1>many occasions that his top priority </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be to put an end to such a </v>

53
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:59.180
<v Speaker 1>catastrophic agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've been doing deals for a long time,</v>

54
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.310
<v Speaker 1>been making lots</v>

55
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.620
<v Speaker 4>of wonderful deals,</v>
<v Speaker 4>great deals.</v>

56
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 4>That's what I do.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Never ever,</v>

57
00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.993
<v Speaker 4>ever in my life have I seen any </v>
<v Speaker 4>transaction so incompetently negotiated </v>

58
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.480
<v Speaker 4>as our deal with Iran.</v>

59
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:16.393
<v Speaker 1>And do you think that this was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical campaign message that every </v>

60
00:03:18.741 --> 00:03:21.890
<v Speaker 1>politician repeats over and over again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then soon forgets about?</v>

61
00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.630
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once the election has finished,</v>

62
00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:28.280
<v Speaker 1>in his first speech at the UN assembly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump repeated it loud and clear.</v>

63
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:29.303
<v Speaker 4>The Iran deal was one of the worst and </v>
<v Speaker 4>most one sided transaction the United </v>

64
00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:39.740
<v Speaker 4>States has ever entered into.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Frankly that deal is an embarrassment to</v>

65
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:44.760
<v Speaker 4>the United States and I don't think </v>
<v Speaker 4>you've heard the last of it.</v>

66
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:45.803
<v Speaker 4>Believe me,</v>

67
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.350
<v Speaker 1>they haven't done so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

68
00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.540
<v Speaker 1>but it is true that both the president </v>
<v Speaker 1>sands,</v>

69
00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.100
<v Speaker 1>many other members of the Republican </v>
<v Speaker 1>Party load,</v>

70
00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:54.860
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely low disagreements and they do</v>

71
00:03:54.861 --> 00:03:56.900
<v Speaker 1>so because among other things </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements,</v>

72
00:03:56.901 --> 00:03:57.734
<v Speaker 1>we're also signed with North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a good deal for the United </v>

73
00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:02.623
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea will freeze and then </v>

74
00:04:03.951 --> 00:04:08.480
<v Speaker 1>dismantle its nuclear program.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea and our other allies will be</v>

75
00:04:08.481 --> 00:04:11.240
<v Speaker 1>better protected and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these agreements,</v>

76
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:15.260
<v Speaker 1>they didn't work at all except for </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowing [inaudible] to lay hands on the</v>

77
00:04:15.261 --> 00:04:15.951
<v Speaker 1>bomb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:19.730
<v Speaker 1>now you might be wondering why exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>is it such a controversial agreements?</v>

79
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to look at that in a bit.</v>

80
00:04:21.411 --> 00:04:22.244
<v Speaker 1>Before we do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look at the context in </v>

81
00:04:24.171 --> 00:04:29.171
<v Speaker 1>which it was signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>

82
00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:34.503
<v Speaker 1>a budding superpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So during the Cold War it is said that </v>

83
00:04:38.681 --> 00:04:43.681
<v Speaker 1>the Russians were so obsessed that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw a Chinese man behind every tree.</v>

84
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:47.860
<v Speaker 1>Something similar might not actually be </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening between it wrong and the USA,</v>

85
00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.483
<v Speaker 1>since the Islamic revolution of command </v>
<v Speaker 1>I in 1979 in Iran has become one of </v>

86
00:04:54.431 --> 00:04:59.080
<v Speaker 1>Washington's worst enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is accused of being the first sponsor</v>

87
00:04:59.081 --> 00:05:01.870
<v Speaker 1>of radical and anti American groups like</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hezbollah,</v>

88
00:05:01.871 --> 00:05:02.704
<v Speaker 1>Hamas or the Taliban.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not to mention their support of the </v>

89
00:05:05.021 --> 00:05:07.240
<v Speaker 1>Syrian regime under the Shah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Al Assad,</v>

90
00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.170
<v Speaker 1>but there is more to this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington knows very well that Iran,</v>

91
00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.000
<v Speaker 1>it's not just any country.</v>

92
00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:20.320
<v Speaker 1>Iran is absolutely huge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got $8,</v>

93
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:21.163
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants and one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatest amounts of mineral wealth on </v>

94
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.313
<v Speaker 1>and hey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not just about oil and natural gas </v>

95
00:05:27.021 --> 00:05:27.854
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also got other minerals like </v>

96
00:05:28.731 --> 00:05:29.660
<v Speaker 1>copper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron,</v>

97
00:05:29.661 --> 00:05:30.630
<v Speaker 1>zinc,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uranium,</v>

98
00:05:30.631 --> 00:05:31.630
<v Speaker 1>silver,</v>
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

99
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.493
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we do all know that oil and natural gas </v>

100
00:05:40.801 --> 00:05:41.634
<v Speaker 1>spelled that particularly important and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is why I now want to ask you a </v>

101
00:05:45.091 --> 00:05:45.924
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the biggest fear of manY </v>

102
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.740
<v Speaker 1>analysts in Washington?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:50.603
<v Speaker 1>that is the sum of Iraq and Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let me explain both countries and </v>

104
00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:56.273
<v Speaker 1>neighbors ever majority shia ruled and </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence of tehran or baghdad has </v>

105
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:02.210
<v Speaker 1>skyrocketed in the last few years.</v>

106
00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:04.743
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

107
00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:05.943
<v Speaker 1>we add up the oil reserves of both </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries for the amount is one of the </v>

108
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:11.140
<v Speaker 1>largest in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's larger than Saudi Arabia.</v>

109
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.033
<v Speaker 1>It's larger than Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so coordinated international politics </v>

110
00:06:14.891 --> 00:06:15.724
<v Speaker 1>between these two countries would result</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a superpower which is outside the </v>

111
00:06:19.061 --> 00:06:23.860
<v Speaker 1>control of Washington with almost a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundred and 20 million people that's not</v>

112
00:06:23.861 --> 00:06:26.140
<v Speaker 1>mentioning all of those other natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

113
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:29.770
<v Speaker 1>This quite simply would be an incredible</v>
<v Speaker 1>amount of influence,</v>

114
00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.850
<v Speaker 1>so then what would happen if Iran got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold of a nuclear bomb?</v>

115
00:06:33.950 --> 00:06:34.990
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>

116
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:35.943
<v Speaker 1>it would certainly consolidate its role </v>
<v Speaker 1>as an international suva power as well </v>

117
00:06:38.651 --> 00:06:41.350
<v Speaker 1>as its influence over its allies like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iraq,</v>

118
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.213
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would also trigger an arms race with </v>

119
00:06:44.261 --> 00:06:45.094
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia and the emirates countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that have already said they won't be </v>

120
00:06:48.191 --> 00:06:51.520
<v Speaker 1>left behind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If tiran managers to get a nuclear bomb.</v>

121
00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:54.450
<v Speaker 1>The results of all this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

122
00:06:54.451 --> 00:06:56.020
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's tension,</v>

123
00:06:56.021 --> 00:06:58.780
<v Speaker 1>it's risk of proliferation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's risk of nuclear disaster.</v>

124
00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.050
<v Speaker 1>That's also a loss of american leverage </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the area.</v>

125
00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:02.913
<v Speaker 1>It goes without saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but seeing such radical governments in </v>

126
00:07:05.081 --> 00:07:05.914
<v Speaker 1>possession of such powerful weapons also</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't make anyone feel particularly </v>

127
00:07:09.101 --> 00:07:10.030
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:10.031 --> 00:07:13.950
<v Speaker 1>that was the situation when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement was reached back in 2015,</v>

129
00:07:18.510 --> 00:07:19.343
<v Speaker 2>the deal</v>

130
00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:23.223
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is trying to stop the </v>

131
00:07:24.471 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>nuclear program with financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>penalties,</v>

132
00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:30.440
<v Speaker 1>but these were pretty useless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't they harm the economy in Iran?</v>

133
00:07:30.441 --> 00:07:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely,</v>

134
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.070
<v Speaker 1>but they did nothing to stop their </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear program.</v>

135
00:07:37.730 --> 00:07:39.740
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on november the 14th of July,</v>

136
00:07:39.741 --> 00:07:42.980
<v Speaker 1>2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nuclear deal was signed an agreement</v>

137
00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.843
<v Speaker 1>with a clear target to prevent </v>
<v Speaker 1>proliferation and make sure Iran only </v>

138
00:07:47.271 --> 00:07:50.360
<v Speaker 1>uses nuclear technology for peaceful </v>
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>

139
00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:52.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since then the deal,</v>

140
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.113
<v Speaker 1>it has suffered harsh attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to have a look at some of </v>

141
00:07:54.801 --> 00:07:56.930
<v Speaker 1>the reasons cited by critics of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement,</v>

142
00:07:56.960 --> 00:07:57.793
<v Speaker 1>but first I think now is a good time to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the circumstances under </v>

143
00:08:01.131 --> 00:08:01.964
<v Speaker 1>which this agreement was signed and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>first thing we need to note is that the </v>

144
00:08:04.491 --> 00:08:07.550
<v Speaker 1>nuclear program in Iran is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very advanced.</v>

145
00:08:11.730 --> 00:08:14.820
<v Speaker 1>AccordIng to us intelligence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the agreement was to be broken,</v>

146
00:08:14.821 --> 00:08:19.320
<v Speaker 1>Iran could develop its first nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>bomb in a matter of months.</v>

147
00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:21.990
<v Speaker 1>This is the way it is today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

148
00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:22.883
<v Speaker 1>and it was even true back in 2015 when </v>
<v Speaker 1>the iranian program was working at it's </v>

149
00:08:26.790 --> 00:08:27.623
<v Speaker 1>fullest capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is why I want to take a moment to </v>

150
00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:31.500
<v Speaker 1>think about three possible outcomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>here,</v>

151
00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:35.010
<v Speaker 1>more agreements or Iran with nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability,</v>

152
00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:42.050
<v Speaker 1>so stopping the nuclear program with </v>
<v Speaker 1>military intervention.</v>

153
00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:46.160
<v Speaker 1>It would not have been an easy task.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would have resulted in many victims.</v>

154
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:48.670
<v Speaker 1>The costs for the us would have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>prohibitive and the us.</v>

155
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.533
<v Speaker 1>We've had to keep a military </v>
<v Speaker 1>intervention in the middle east for </v>

156
00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:52.573
<v Speaker 1>decades to compare.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is estimated that this would be the </v>

157
00:08:55.171 --> 00:08:56.004
<v Speaker 1>Iraq war multiplied by five because I </v>
<v Speaker 1>mean it's one thing to destroy </v>

158
00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.103
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure and it's a very different</v>
<v Speaker 1>thing to eliminate the knowledge that a </v>

159
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.124
<v Speaker 1>country has to make nuclear bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama kneW that the situation was </v>

160
00:09:08.491 --> 00:09:09.324
<v Speaker 1>totally impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What he wanted was to get away from the </v>

161
00:09:11.221 --> 00:09:15.270
<v Speaker 1>middle east and not get into any more </v>
<v Speaker 1>trouble in this region because it's been</v>

162
00:09:15.271 --> 00:09:17.730
<v Speaker 1>something of a chronic nightmare for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

163
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:23.370
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is not doing anything.</v>

164
00:09:23.371 --> 00:09:24.204
<v Speaker 1>Would've meant that Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've gotten their new toy and as we </v>

165
00:09:26.161 --> 00:09:26.994
<v Speaker 1>have seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have resulted in an arms race </v>

166
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.780
<v Speaker 1>in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which Washington didn't want either.</v>

167
00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.090
<v Speaker 1>So an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was the only option left.</v>

168
00:09:33.091 --> 00:09:35.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we make a deal and everyone's happy,</v>

169
00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:37.560
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just wait there for a second.</v>

170
00:09:37.561 --> 00:09:40.980
<v Speaker 1>Because despite that many experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially republicans,</v>

171
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:43.410
<v Speaker 1>don't even want to hear about this pact.</v>

172
00:09:44.010 --> 00:09:48.030
<v Speaker 5>Bad deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Obama broke every rule of negotiation.</v>

173
00:09:48.060 --> 00:09:51.120
<v Speaker 5>We get an agreement,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a very questionable value.</v>

174
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.150
<v Speaker 5>If I am elected president on the very </v>
<v Speaker 5>first day in office,</v>

175
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.530
<v Speaker 5>I Will rip to shreds this catastrophic </v>
<v Speaker 5>iranian nuclear deal.</v>

176
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:03.030
<v Speaker 5>The iranians have been given a blank </v>
<v Speaker 5>check basically by,</v>

177
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:05.640
<v Speaker 5>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 5>by depressing the United States.</v>

178
00:10:05.980 --> 00:10:09.760
<v Speaker 1>I think it will just warhawks determined</v>
<v Speaker 1>to impose their ideas by forced,</v>

179
00:10:09.761 --> 00:10:12.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe there are some like that.</v>

180
00:10:12.070 --> 00:10:12.903
<v Speaker 1>But the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they all say the points they say when </v>

181
00:10:14.921 --> 00:10:15.754
<v Speaker 1>they arise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the u s already signed many </v>

182
00:10:17.171 --> 00:10:18.004
<v Speaker 1>agreements with North Korea and pyong </v>
<v Speaker 1>yang never kept its weren't which is </v>

183
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:23.590
<v Speaker 1>wide.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North korean is now in nuclear power.</v>

184
00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:24.453
<v Speaker 1>They are convinced that Iran will do the</v>
<v Speaker 1>same and there is no better evidence </v>

185
00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:30.370
<v Speaker 1>than the fact that Iran has not stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>their ballistic missile program.</v>

186
00:10:31.600 --> 00:10:32.433
<v Speaker 6>Iran is boosting its missile </v>
<v Speaker 6>capabilities in order to increase the </v>

187
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:36.453
<v Speaker 6>accuracy,</v>
<v Speaker 6>precision and range Iran will not stop </v>

188
00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:41.470
<v Speaker 6>its missile projects</v>

189
00:10:41.620 --> 00:10:42.453
<v Speaker 1>and this program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what has being developed with North </v>

190
00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:44.983
<v Speaker 1>Korea and technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it seems clear which way deal with </v>

191
00:10:47.321 --> 00:10:48.370
<v Speaker 1>Iran will go.</v>

192
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:49.303
<v Speaker 4>We cannot let a murderous regime </v>
<v Speaker 4>continue these destabilizing activities </v>

193
00:10:57.110 --> 00:10:57.943
<v Speaker 4>while building dangerous missiles and we</v>
<v Speaker 4>cannot abide by an agreement if it </v>

194
00:11:03.231 --> 00:11:08.231
<v Speaker 4>provides cover for the eventual </v>
<v Speaker 4>construction of a nuclear program.</v>

195
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.300
<v Speaker 1>The science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since the bank does a limited duration,</v>

196
00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:15.240
<v Speaker 1>Iran could still put itself in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>position to get its arsenal.</v>

197
00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:18.990
<v Speaker 1>The moment the deal is over and it could</v>
<v Speaker 1>be armed within a matter of months.</v>

198
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:21.110
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we have seen the alternatives,</v>

199
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.013
<v Speaker 1>they're really not any better is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran doesn't necessarily need to go the </v>

200
00:11:25.321 --> 00:11:26.220
<v Speaker 1>way of North Korea.</v>

201
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.493
<v Speaker 5>You're on</v>

202
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:33.040
<v Speaker 6>benefits of the agreement.</v>

203
00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.663
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure many of you are thinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>that comparing North Korea and Iran is </v>

204
00:11:38.311 --> 00:11:39.144
<v Speaker 1>easy after all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both countries are radical </v>

205
00:11:40.801 --> 00:11:42.060
<v Speaker 1>dictatorships,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

206
00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:43.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean not really to be.</v>

207
00:11:43.921 --> 00:11:48.390
<v Speaker 1>Third things that quite a bit different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iranian society is much more open minded</v>

208
00:11:48.391 --> 00:11:49.224
<v Speaker 1>than north korean society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Iran there is a well formed middle </v>

209
00:11:51.501 --> 00:11:52.334
<v Speaker 1>class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are political debates and things </v>

210
00:11:53.531 --> 00:11:55.750
<v Speaker 1>like having a smartphone and access to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the internet.</v>

211
00:11:55.810 --> 00:11:57.490
<v Speaker 1>It's really quite common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

212
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:00.220
<v Speaker 1>most Iranians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the younger generation,</v>

213
00:12:00.500 --> 00:12:02.410
<v Speaker 1>clearly pro agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

214
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.870
<v Speaker 1>it's not just a matter of international </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>

215
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.733
<v Speaker 1>it's also a matter of quantity of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The penalties is put in place by the </v>

216
00:12:09.251 --> 00:12:10.084
<v Speaker 1>international community.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were very damagIng for her in 2013 </v>

217
00:12:16.210 --> 00:12:17.043
<v Speaker 1>when presidents ahmadinejad the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>defender of the agreements left power </v>

218
00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:22.930
<v Speaker 1>the economy of Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It waS devastated.</v>

219
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.120
<v Speaker 1>For an investment vanished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The unemployment rate skyrocketed.</v>

220
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>Inflation grew to around 40 percent and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the expectations for improvements,</v>

221
00:12:30.500 --> 00:12:31.930
<v Speaker 1>it's high.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

222
00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:32.973
<v Speaker 1>it was a complete mess,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but thanks to the agreement that </v>

223
00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:38.620
<v Speaker 1>penalties started to disappear and since</v>
<v Speaker 1>then aisle exports of triples.</v>

224
00:12:38.680 --> 00:12:39.513
<v Speaker 1>I mean Iraq is not North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need the trade on the economic </v>

225
00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:44.310
<v Speaker 1>advantages that disagreement is.</v>

226
00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:45.373
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

227
00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:51.270
<v Speaker 6>Joint comprehensive plan of action will </v>
<v Speaker 6>produce the comprehensive lifting of all</v>

228
00:12:51.271 --> 00:12:52.104
<v Speaker 6>un security council sanctions as well as</v>
<v Speaker 6>multilateral and national sanctions </v>

229
00:12:56.490 --> 00:12:57.323
<v Speaker 6>related to iran's nuclear program,</v>
<v Speaker 6>including steps on access in areas of </v>

230
00:13:01.471 --> 00:13:03.180
<v Speaker 6>trade,</v>
<v Speaker 6>technology,</v>

231
00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.920
<v Speaker 6>finance,</v>
<v Speaker 6>and energy.</v>

232
00:13:05.170 --> 00:13:06.003
<v Speaker 1>The hope for obama's administration was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that with a more prosperous and trade </v>

233
00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:10.000
<v Speaker 1>open Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the younger,</v>

234
00:13:10.001 --> 00:13:13.660
<v Speaker 1>more openminded generation would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to take power in a few years.</v>

235
00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:14.523
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who opposed the agreements argue </v>

236
00:13:16.011 --> 00:13:16.844
<v Speaker 1>it's necessary to be more demanding with</v>
<v Speaker 1>roland because otherwise it will </v>

237
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.690
<v Speaker 1>eventually become another North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a new nuclear power.</v>

238
00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:23.583
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not an easy situation is you can </v>

239
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:26.140
<v Speaker 1>see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but truth be told,</v>

240
00:13:26.170 --> 00:13:27.003
<v Speaker 1>I think it would be a mistake to think </v>
<v Speaker 1>that any pact is bad until proven </v>

241
00:13:30.461 --> 00:13:31.294
<v Speaker 1>otherwise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having to run under pressure might be a </v>

242
00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:36.040
<v Speaker 1>good strategy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's be careful not to go too far,</v>

243
00:13:36.100 --> 00:13:37.480
<v Speaker 1>but we could all lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
