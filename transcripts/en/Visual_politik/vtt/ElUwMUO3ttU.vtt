00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.320
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.343
<v Speaker 2>Chechnya is an island of Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>fanaticism in the middle of Vladimir </v>

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.810
<v Speaker 2>Putin's Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

4
00:00:13.811 --> 00:00:14.644
<v Speaker 2>You had that rights when it comes to me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that congratulates itself on being the </v>

5
00:00:16.931 --> 00:00:19.510
<v Speaker 2>spiritual shelter of the West.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The laws,</v>

6
00:00:19.511 --> 00:00:20.920
<v Speaker 2>the bullock of Christiana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

7
00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.020
<v Speaker 2>this is a country where you can find the</v>
<v Speaker 2>republic of Chechnya.</v>

8
00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.870
<v Speaker 2>It's a positive Russia where it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>impossible to buy him.</v>

9
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.023
<v Speaker 1>Cut.</v>

10
00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.720
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Was I know what you're going to see.</v>

11
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:33.563
<v Speaker 2>I'm waiting an assignment that didn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>you just say the republic of Chechnya </v>

12
00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.390
<v Speaker 2>didn't say that it was a part of Russia?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

13
00:00:38.391 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 2>the truth is the Russian Federation is </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory wise,</v>

14
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:41.804
<v Speaker 2>the biggest country in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that means that their political </v>

15
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:46.400
<v Speaker 2>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really complicated.</v>

16
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:47.383
<v Speaker 2>The biggest parts of the country is </v>
<v Speaker 2>divided into the so called oblasts </v>

17
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:50.563
<v Speaker 2>switch up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Similar to the states in the United </v>

18
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.751
<v Speaker 2>States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These areas,</v>

19
00:00:53.751 --> 00:00:55.670
<v Speaker 2>they have their own governor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their own parliaments,</v>

20
00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:59.480
<v Speaker 2>but they must respect the Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution as well as the Kremlin.</v>

21
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.670
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are other regions in Russia,</v>

22
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:05.180
<v Speaker 2>the so called republics that have way </v>
<v Speaker 2>more autonomy.</v>

23
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.043
<v Speaker 2>They have their own constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have their own language and they </v>

24
00:01:07.641 --> 00:01:08.474
<v Speaker 2>could even have that own official.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of these republics is the Crimean </v>

25
00:01:16.321 --> 00:01:20.190
<v Speaker 2>republic and despite not being </v>
<v Speaker 2>recognized by America or by Europe,</v>

26
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.220
<v Speaker 2>it is controlled by Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You've seen in theory,</v>

27
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.800
<v Speaker 2>Russian law guarantees a lot of autonomy</v>
<v Speaker 2>bots.</v>

28
00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.190
<v Speaker 2>I say in theory like that because as you</v>
<v Speaker 2>know,</v>

29
00:01:29.191 --> 00:01:33.270
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Putin loves to keep this </v>
<v Speaker 2>country under tight control.</v>

30
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.173
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>almost all of the presidents of the </v>

31
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:40.050
<v Speaker 2>republics belonged to Putin's political </v>
<v Speaker 2>party and that would be united Russia.</v>

32
00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.240
<v Speaker 2>Anytime one of those governors </v>
<v Speaker 2>challenges Putin,</v>

33
00:01:42.241 --> 00:01:45.060
<v Speaker 2>even just the little things like this </v>
<v Speaker 2>happen</v>

34
00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.460
<v Speaker 2>Tatarstan the last region to lose its </v>
<v Speaker 2>special status under Putin.</v>

35
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:52.563
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is a real public that Putin does </v>

36
00:01:54.221 --> 00:01:55.520
<v Speaker 2>not dare to bully.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

37
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:56.880
<v Speaker 2>You had that ride.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Vladimir Putin,</v>

38
00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:57.723
<v Speaker 2>the Chuck Norris of politics is afraid </v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes to specifically when it comes </v>

39
00:02:02.591 --> 00:02:03.430
<v Speaker 2>to Chechnya,</v>

40
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:05.170
<v Speaker 1>is</v>

41
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.003
<v Speaker 2>often unclear who rules whom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian observers of the region </v>

42
00:02:08.861 --> 00:02:12.460
<v Speaker 2>complained that Russian law and </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority stops at the Chechnyan border.</v>

43
00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.490
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Chechnya,</v>

44
00:02:20.491 --> 00:02:21.324
<v Speaker 2>the hijab is promoted by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like polygamy and even marriages </v>

45
00:02:24.931 --> 00:02:29.010
<v Speaker 2>involving minors that are actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>tolerated and no restaurant.</v>

46
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.400
<v Speaker 2>Dez to open a daytime during Ramadan </v>
<v Speaker 2>season.</v>

47
00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.960
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of these things,</v>

48
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.823
<v Speaker 2>I'm nothing compared to what some </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspapers showed in April of 2017 </v>

49
00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Chechnya opens worlds first </v>
<v Speaker 2>concentration camp for homosexuals.</v>

50
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

51
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.303
<v Speaker 2>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know he picked it is not exactly the </v>

52
00:02:49.511 --> 00:02:50.344
<v Speaker 2>biggest fan of lgbt rights,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but opening a gay concentration camp </v>

53
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.463
<v Speaker 2>sounds like it it too much even for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question to be made here is why </v>

54
00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.953
<v Speaker 2>doesn't put some order into Chechnya?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What is the church and President Rams </v>

55
00:03:03.971 --> 00:03:07.960
<v Speaker 2>and off secret to getting Putin that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>and let him do as he pleases.</v>

56
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>Well today we are going to answer all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those questions,</v>

57
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the history.</v>

58
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:14.463
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

59
00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.130
<v Speaker 2>The Sicily of the Caucasus for centuries</v>
<v Speaker 2>Czechian yet was ruled by big clams that</v>

60
00:03:22.651 --> 00:03:23.484
<v Speaker 2>have power over specific areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those clams named took home in the </v>

61
00:03:26.821 --> 00:03:30.300
<v Speaker 2>church in language we're composed of </v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds of smaller families.</v>

62
00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.060
<v Speaker 2>The so called tip or a better </v>
<v Speaker 2>understanding.</v>

63
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.150
<v Speaker 2>This was pretty similar to the Sicilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>mafia system.</v>

64
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.133
<v Speaker 2>Everything stayed in the file.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything was done according to the </v>

65
00:03:42.791 --> 00:03:45.070
<v Speaker 2>principles of religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>

66
00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.990
<v Speaker 2>Sunni Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the same way.</v>

67
00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:49.870
<v Speaker 2>The Sicilian mafia resisted all kinds of</v>
<v Speaker 2>invasions.</v>

68
00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.763
<v Speaker 2>The Chechen took him system that </v>
<v Speaker 2>survived the saws and even the Soviet </v>

69
00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:55.383
<v Speaker 2>Union.</v>

70
00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:57.080
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

71
00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:57.913
<v Speaker 2>it must be Soviets in public and Muslims</v>
<v Speaker 2>in private Chechnyan proverb and other </v>

72
00:04:01.321 --> 00:04:02.154
<v Speaker 2>words during the Soviet era that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>two parallel systems that were running </v>

73
00:04:05.491 --> 00:04:08.100
<v Speaker 2>at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a surface that was communism,</v>

74
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.810
<v Speaker 2>but under grounds there was a hierarchy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Muslim clams and families.</v>

75
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:16.770
<v Speaker 2>This is why in the year 1991 when the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Soviet Union disappeared,</v>

76
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.753
<v Speaker 2>Chechens seize the opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>declared the Chechen Republic of a </v>

77
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:21.920
<v Speaker 2>carrier.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>

78
00:04:21.921 --> 00:04:22.754
<v Speaker 2>and I might ring a bell with you because</v>
<v Speaker 2>it appears in one of the call of duty </v>

79
00:04:24.831 --> 00:04:29.831
<v Speaker 2>video games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now back then,</v>

80
00:04:31.051 --> 00:04:33.210
<v Speaker 2>the presidents of the brand new Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Federation,</v>

81
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:34.073
<v Speaker 2>that was Boris Yeltsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and he replied to those rebels with </v>

82
00:04:37.171 --> 00:04:38.004
<v Speaker 2>military Yeltsin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>declares emergency curfew and Chechen </v>

83
00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.530
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nevertheless,</v>

84
00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:45.423
<v Speaker 2>this state of emergency fails entirely.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Russian army was incapable of </v>

85
00:04:49.151 --> 00:04:52.660
<v Speaker 2>stopping the chapter and rentals and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have to run back home.</v>

86
00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.090
<v Speaker 2>But not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during their retreats,</v>

87
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:58.270
<v Speaker 2>these separatist rebels seized Russian </v>
<v Speaker 2>weapons.</v>

88
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 2>So for three long years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Kremlin puts up with Chechnya.</v>

89
00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:05.950
<v Speaker 2>But in the year 1994 well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things they changed.</v>

90
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.770
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

91
00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.190
<v Speaker 2>you can build a throne with band nets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's difficult to sit on it,</v>

92
00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.473
<v Speaker 2>Boris Yeltsin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But do you remember what I told you </v>

93
00:05:16.321 --> 00:05:17.154
<v Speaker 2>about the political system of Chechnya,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was based on the took him clan </v>

94
00:05:19.381 --> 00:05:20.370
<v Speaker 2>system?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.360
<v Speaker 2>the truth is these different clans </v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't really get on very well with each</v>

96
00:05:24.361 --> 00:05:27.060
<v Speaker 2>other,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this was the start of a civil war,</v>

97
00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.250
<v Speaker 2>a civil war.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's to rush eyes.</v>

98
00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 2>Where's the perfect opportunity to take </v>
<v Speaker 2>back control of the republic?</v>

99
00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.690
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a year later,</v>

100
00:05:33.691 --> 00:05:34.524
<v Speaker 2>the Russian army had lost 6,000 soldiers</v>
<v Speaker 2>and poor Boris Yeltsin had to sign a </v>

101
00:05:37.411 --> 00:05:41.360
<v Speaker 2>peace treaty with the separatists ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Pretty weak governments of Chechnya.</v>

102
00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:42.263
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many Islamic terrorists from Saudi </v>

103
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:44.783
<v Speaker 2>Arabia and Afghanistan fled to Grozny.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Chechen capitol to recruit new </v>

104
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:48.804
<v Speaker 2>members are failed states with a tribal </v>
<v Speaker 2>system where Islam is the official </v>

105
00:05:51.871 --> 00:05:52.704
<v Speaker 2>religion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That sounds like a pretty great market </v>

106
00:05:53.911 --> 00:05:55.230
<v Speaker 2>for recruiting terrorists.</v>

107
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.210
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in other words,</v>

108
00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:07.170
<v Speaker 2>all of this meant that it was just a </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter of time before another war again.</v>

109
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.273
<v Speaker 2>So this war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it started in 1999 when a group of </v>

110
00:06:10.501 --> 00:06:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Islamic rebels invaded a neighboring </v>
<v Speaker 2>Russian republic,</v>

111
00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:14.573
<v Speaker 2>the Republic of Dagestan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if making trouble in their own </v>

112
00:06:17.221 --> 00:06:21.390
<v Speaker 2>territory wasn't enough Chechens wanting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to attack other parts of Russia.</v>

113
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.850
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you might imagine from this,</v>

114
00:06:23.851 --> 00:06:26.580
<v Speaker 2>the Kremlin decided to send the troops </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately,</v>

115
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.210
<v Speaker 2>but this time it was pretty different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why was this?</v>

116
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.073
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite the fact Boris Yeltsin was the </v>

117
00:06:32.161 --> 00:06:32.994
<v Speaker 2>president this time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the prime minister was the one and only </v>

118
00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.830
<v Speaker 2>the hero of visual politic.</v>

<v Speaker 2>Chechnya,</v>

128
00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:02.310
<v Speaker 2>but that is only one condition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>No wars,</v>

<v Speaker 2>it was over and catterall views all that</v>
<v Speaker 2>help from the Kremlin.</v>

133
00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:14.480
<v Speaker 2>Do you destroy it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The other warlords in the report,</v>

134
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:21.380
<v Speaker 2>and now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

135
00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:24.620
<v Speaker 2>did all of this work really answer says </v>
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

136
00:07:24.770 --> 00:07:28.700
<v Speaker 2>I'm sort of all say no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course there were no more wars,</v>

137
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:29.563
<v Speaker 2>but many of those other warlords started</v>
<v Speaker 2>organizing terrorist attacks in other </v>

138
00:07:32.841 --> 00:07:35.300
<v Speaker 2>areas of Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including Moscow.</v>

139
00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.193
<v Speaker 2>In the Moscow case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a terrorist group kidnaps over 300 </v>

140
00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:42.050
<v Speaker 2>hostages in a theater.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of those 300 civilians,</v>

141
00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.810
<v Speaker 2>170 died.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

142
00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:45.673
<v Speaker 2>Putin's plan was far from perfect and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kevin Authority was not taken for </v>

143
00:07:49.731 --> 00:07:50.750
<v Speaker 2>granted.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

144
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:54.710
<v Speaker 2>some years later he would die in another</v>
<v Speaker 2>terrorist attack in Grozny Allen's.</v>

145
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:55.544
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that was the moment when the main </v>

146
00:07:56.841 --> 00:07:59.500
<v Speaker 2>character in all of this story comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>into the picture.</v>

147

149
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.270
<v Speaker 2>If you want to start a dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you better make it big.</v>

150
00:08:16.390 --> 00:08:19.300
<v Speaker 2>We all talking about a country full of </v>
<v Speaker 2>warlords fighting each other.</v>

<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

00:08:24.431 --> 00:08:27.190
<v Speaker 2>he was not willing to let those weird </v>
<v Speaker 2>western fashions,</v>

<v Speaker 2>If I ever forget this,</v>

160
00:08:41.411 --> 00:08:44.560
<v Speaker 2>I am not a math.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When I went through a terribly hard time</v>

<v Speaker 2>in my life,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Truth</v>

165
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.580
<v Speaker 2>is since kind of rope came to power </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chechen in other parts of Russia,</v>

166
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:58.980
<v Speaker 2>while they've disappeared,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not only that,</v>

<v Speaker 2>families and then bud's down the houses.</v>

170
00:09:10.710 --> 00:09:11.543
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

171
00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:13.880
<v Speaker 2>this was not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cut Her off.</v>

172
00:09:13.881 --> 00:09:14.714
<v Speaker 2>Soldiers offer themselves as volunteers </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the most dangerous missions in </v>

173
00:09:17.751 --> 00:09:18.890
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

174
00:09:18.891 --> 00:09:19.724
<v Speaker 2>in order to show his love for Putin rams</v>
<v Speaker 2>and candor of organize the military </v>

175
00:09:22.101 --> 00:09:26.210
<v Speaker 2>parade at Cross knee football stadium,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of soldiers were waving at the</v>

176
00:09:26.211 --> 00:09:27.044
<v Speaker 2>Chechen presidents ready to die for him.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If Putin tells me to get my army </v>

177
00:09:32.241 --> 00:09:33.410
<v Speaker 2>together,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm ready.</v>

178
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.240
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] rough bus things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

179
00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:39.120
<v Speaker 2>they are not as sweet as they might </v>
<v Speaker 2>seem.</v>

180
00:09:39.121 --> 00:09:42.690
<v Speaker 2>Actually with that military parade cadre</v>
<v Speaker 2>off was given two messages.</v>

181
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:44.040
<v Speaker 2>One was,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey Putin,</v>

182
00:09:44.070 --> 00:09:45.810
<v Speaker 2>I'm your buddy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the other was,</v>

183
00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.880
<v Speaker 2>hey Putin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you ever stopped being my buddy,</v>

184
00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:51.240
<v Speaker 2>come and get me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you dare.</v>

185
00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.550
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>DIV UA.</v>

186
00:09:52.551 --> 00:09:56.120
<v Speaker 2>If flattening a Putin ever wanted to </v>
<v Speaker 2>confront his Chechen bestie,</v>

187
00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:58.620
<v Speaker 2>it would be complicated to save the </v>
<v Speaker 2>League</v>

188
00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.350
<v Speaker 2>spent on many signs that this could </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually happen.</v>

189
00:10:04.351 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of Kadar,</v>

190
00:10:05.330 --> 00:10:06.163
<v Speaker 2>rob's political foes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've been murdered regardless of </v>

191
00:10:08.731 --> 00:10:09.564
<v Speaker 2>where they work.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For journalists living in Moscow to </v>

192
00:10:11.761 --> 00:10:13.980
<v Speaker 2>political opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 2>siding in some Petersburg,</v>

193
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.650
<v Speaker 2>they've all been kills like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

194
00:10:15.651 --> 00:10:16.890
<v Speaker 2>what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What it means.</v>

195
00:10:16.891 --> 00:10:21.891
<v Speaker 2>The government of Grozny has its own kgb</v>
<v Speaker 2>situated all across the country and well</v>

196
00:10:22.680 --> 00:10:23.513
<v Speaker 2>they're happy to use it anytime someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chechen or not get seen little bits </v>

197
00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:28.583
<v Speaker 2>bothersome so it puts it more poetically</v>
<v Speaker 2>well piecing created rams and cat are </v>

198
00:10:31.681 --> 00:10:35.580
<v Speaker 2>off and now his creation has become big </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough to look him in the eye.</v>

199
00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.113
<v Speaker 2>This explains why I'm like other </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidents of Russian republics kind of </v>

200
00:10:42.851 --> 00:10:43.684
<v Speaker 2>relevant dares to give his opinion on </v>
<v Speaker 2>international affairs and the creme and </v>

201
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.710
<v Speaker 2>they pretended they don't see those </v>
<v Speaker 2>horrific gay concentration camps.</v>

202
00:10:52.790 --> 00:10:53.110
<v Speaker 3>Russia</v>

203
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:54.350
<v Speaker 2>backs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chechnya governments,</v>

204
00:10:54.351 --> 00:10:56.750
<v Speaker 2>denials over killing a torture of gay </v>
<v Speaker 2>men.</v>

205
00:10:56.990 --> 00:10:57.823
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chechnya is getting wealthier and </v>

206
00:10:59.421 --> 00:11:00.254
<v Speaker 2>wealthier thanks to Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>90% of their wealth comes direct from </v>

207
00:11:04.011 --> 00:11:06.500
<v Speaker 2>money transfers from the Kremlin her </v>
<v Speaker 2>off.</v>

208
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.393
<v Speaker 2>He's built a republic where the cause of</v>
<v Speaker 2>his personality is always like a second </v>
