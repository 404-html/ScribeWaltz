1
00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.093
<v Speaker 1>Forty five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's been 45 years since China and </v>

2
00:00:11.951 --> 00:00:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Australia established diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations.</v>

3
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.470
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have changed a lot.</v>

4
00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 2>Shawna was founded in 1949 with this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>with these words,</v>

5
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.200
<v Speaker 2>John Wall run man's punchy life that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese people have stood up.</v>

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.483
<v Speaker 2>It was an assertion of sovereignty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was an assertion of pride and we </v>

7
00:00:37.961 --> 00:00:41.500
<v Speaker 2>stand up and so we say hourly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I run Manzanar,</v>

8
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.630
<v Speaker 2>Eli,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Australian people stand up</v>

9
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:48.030
<v Speaker 3>through</v>

10
00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.863
<v Speaker 1>all these years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both countries have maintained one of </v>

11
00:00:51.331 --> 00:00:52.164
<v Speaker 1>the most fruitful,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversial and interesting </v>

12
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:54.744
<v Speaker 1>relationships in the world are </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship based on stories about </v>

13
00:00:57.481 --> 00:00:58.450
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>spies,</v>

14
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.180
<v Speaker 1>accusations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>infidelities,</v>

15
00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.073
<v Speaker 1>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many conflicting interests because in </v>

16
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:04.824
<v Speaker 1>all honesty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we're talking about a relationship </v>

17
00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:08.610
<v Speaker 1>between two people instead of two </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

18
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.640
<v Speaker 1>we have a great script for an Alaskan </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Tele Novella.</v>

19
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Obviously this swell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is visual politics,</v>

20
00:01:18.561 --> 00:01:20.740
<v Speaker 1>so let's get right to the point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shall we.</v>

21
00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.883
<v Speaker 3>Today,</v>

22
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.970
<v Speaker 1>China is Australia's main commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>partner.</v>

23
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.420
<v Speaker 1>That purchases represents about a third </v>
<v Speaker 1>of all Australian exports,</v>

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:33.600
<v Speaker 1>eight times more than exports to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

25
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.823
<v Speaker 1>In 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and Australia signed a free trade </v>

26
00:01:37.021 --> 00:01:37.854
<v Speaker 1>agreements and today their trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations exceed a hundred and </v>

27
00:01:40.801 --> 00:01:43.200
<v Speaker 1>$55,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>per year,</v>

28
00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:51.773
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is also becoming an incredibly </v>

29
00:01:54.151 --> 00:01:54.984
<v Speaker 1>important investor in Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I couldn't freak where one in 20 people </v>

30
00:01:58.291 --> 00:01:59.124
<v Speaker 1>or Chinese among them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many millionaires who decided to find a </v>

31
00:02:01.651 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>safer place with more guarantees for </v>
<v Speaker 1>their assets and their lives,</v>

32
00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.193
<v Speaker 1>such as the scale of trade that </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial markets have long been of the </v>

33
00:02:09.301 --> 00:02:10.134
<v Speaker 1>view that the Australian dollar is one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the best proxies for bets on China </v>

34
00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.850
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>James Laurenson,</v>

35
00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.790
<v Speaker 1>deputy director of the Australia China </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations institute.</v>

36
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this all has its consequences.</v>

37
00:02:23.811 --> 00:02:25.850
<v Speaker 1>We already talked about it here on </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic.</v>

38
00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.880
<v Speaker 1>Australia has broken records and does </v>
<v Speaker 1>not have a national crisis for almost 30</v>

39
00:02:31.071 --> 00:02:32.750
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sounds pretty amazing.</v>

40
00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:33.783
<v Speaker 1>Rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the great Chinese takeoff had a </v>

41
00:02:34.671 --> 00:02:36.260
<v Speaker 1>lot to do with all of this success.</v>

42
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.730
<v Speaker 3>Therefore,</v>

43
00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.563
<v Speaker 1>it's easy to understand why when the </v>
<v Speaker 1>lowery institute's and important thing </v>

44
00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 1>tank in the country asked Australians </v>
<v Speaker 1>last year,</v>

45
00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.280
<v Speaker 1>which relationship was more important to</v>
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>

46
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.850
<v Speaker 1>The one with the United States or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one with China and the result,</v>

47
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:50.753
<v Speaker 1>but it was a tie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is despite the fact that relations </v>

48
00:02:53.241 --> 00:02:55.550
<v Speaker 1>within North American friends very close</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>

49
00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.220
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in spite of this romance,</v>

50
00:02:58.221 --> 00:03:03.221
<v Speaker 1>the fact is for thousand and 17 was not </v>
<v Speaker 1>a year of love for Australia and China.</v>

51
00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:05.563
<v Speaker 1>Check out what Bob Carr,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former minister for foreign affairs of </v>

52
00:03:08.141 --> 00:03:08.974
<v Speaker 1>Australia set on the subject this year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia declared rhetorical war on </v>

53
00:03:12.521 --> 00:03:13.354
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The words being used by Australian </v>

54
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.184
<v Speaker 1>leaders are the harshest anytime since </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomatic relations commenced in 1972 </v>

55
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.180
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of comments at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>time of the Tiananmen crackdown.</v>

56
00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:24.950
<v Speaker 1>The Tony's harsher than that of any </v>
<v Speaker 1>other US ally,</v>

57
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.890
<v Speaker 1>including Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

58
00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.920
<v Speaker 1>2017 was a very difficult year for both </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries relations.</v>

59
00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.870
<v Speaker 1>So much so that a survey by the global </v>
<v Speaker 1>times,</v>

60
00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.950
<v Speaker 1>one of China's most popular newspapers </v>
<v Speaker 1>examines the Australia,</v>

61
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.440
<v Speaker 1>was the most hostile country to China in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017.</v>

62
00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.540
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that with trump in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>White House,</v>

63
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.403
<v Speaker 1>those are really big words because we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't continue to allow China to rape </v>

64
00:03:50.171 --> 00:03:51.940
<v Speaker 1>our country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's what they're doing.</v>

65
00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.360
<v Speaker 1>It's the greatest theft in the history </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>

66
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.253
<v Speaker 1>So what the hell has happened?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What has led to so much dissension </v>

67
00:03:58.271 --> 00:04:00.640
<v Speaker 1>between Canberra and Beijing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

68
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.481
<v Speaker 1>that A.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look at that,</v>

69
00:04:01.481 --> 00:04:02.314
<v Speaker 1>shall we?</v>

70
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.770
<v Speaker 1>The storm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

71
00:04:10.771 --> 00:04:14.070
<v Speaker 1>first 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>seems like it'd be a good year for China</v>

72
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.933
<v Speaker 1>and Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economic relations wouldn't stop </v>

73
00:04:16.411 --> 00:04:18.480
<v Speaker 1>growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump's shedding off his best diplomatic</v>

74
00:04:18.481 --> 00:04:20.820
<v Speaker 1>skills hung up on the Australian prime </v>
<v Speaker 1>minister,</v>

75
00:04:20.821 --> 00:04:21.654
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Turnbull himself further sinking</v>
<v Speaker 1>his popularity in this area of the </v>

76
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:27.380
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We had a good telephone call,</v>

77
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.383
<v Speaker 1>a very cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Australian government's even </v>

78
00:04:30.211 --> 00:04:31.044
<v Speaker 1>publicly supported China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>replacing the United States as a main </v>

79
00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.250
<v Speaker 1>member of the fails TPP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific free trade agreements.</v>

80
00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.800
<v Speaker 1>We could almost say those in telanovela </v>
<v Speaker 1>terms.</v>

81
00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.920
<v Speaker 1>Love was about to triumph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

82
00:04:48.461 --> 00:04:49.294
<v Speaker 1>the good times didn't last long and </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything started to go wrong about </v>

83
00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:55.240
<v Speaker 1>halfway through the year and it went </v>
<v Speaker 1>really wrong.</v>

84
00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.400
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have had clashes before,</v>

85
00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:59.740
<v Speaker 1>but nothing really major in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

86
00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:00.603
<v Speaker 1>The Australian government has followed a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strategy that basically it consisted of </v>

87
00:05:04.121 --> 00:05:07.630
<v Speaker 1>trying to balance that position between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing and Washington.</v>

88
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:09.013
<v Speaker 3>To</v>

89
00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:14.083
<v Speaker 1>don't make matters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was all Beijing and insecurity and </v>

90
00:05:16.101 --> 00:05:17.930
<v Speaker 1>defense matters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a Washington.</v>

91
00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.853
<v Speaker 1>We already mentioned on visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Republicans consider Australia to </v>

92
00:05:21.861 --> 00:05:22.694
<v Speaker 1>be the US is best ally and so should be.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia is the only country that has </v>

93
00:05:28.491 --> 00:05:29.324
<v Speaker 1>intervened in every major us walk and </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years the military relations have </v>

94
00:05:33.171 --> 00:05:34.004
<v Speaker 1>been so tight that Australia has become </v>
<v Speaker 1>for us as spearhead in this area of the </v>

95
00:05:37.881 --> 00:05:38.200
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

96
00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.033
<v Speaker 3>Awesome.</v>

97
00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:41.413
<v Speaker 1>The Australian prime minister himself is</v>
<v Speaker 1>trimmed as great appreciation for the </v>

98
00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:45.373
<v Speaker 1>United States saying the peace and </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability of a region has been enabled </v>

99
00:05:48.081 --> 00:05:48.914
<v Speaker 1>by consistent us global leadership.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While that leadership would not have </v>

100
00:05:51.801 --> 00:05:54.620
<v Speaker 1>been possible without the hard power of </v>
<v Speaker 1>fleets and armies,</v>

101
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 1>its greatest potency has come from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>values we embodies.</v>

102
00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.630
<v Speaker 1>Through all the twists and turns of </v>
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>

103
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:02.420
<v Speaker 1>the United States has stood for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>values on which it's great.</v>

104
00:06:02.421 --> 00:06:04.070
<v Speaker 1>Republic was founded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom,</v>

105
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:05.840
<v Speaker 1>democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the rule of law.</v>

106
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:09.370
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm Turnbull.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to the Chinese matter.</v>

107
00:06:09.410 --> 00:06:10.243
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these words were pronounced on June the </v>

108
00:06:12.021 --> 00:06:12.854
<v Speaker 1>second 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was the first time in Australian </v>

109
00:06:15.051 --> 00:06:15.884
<v Speaker 1>prime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Minister spoke so clearly in favor of </v>

110
00:06:17.061 --> 00:06:20.240
<v Speaker 1>Washington in a speech which was also </v>
<v Speaker 1>full of warnings to China.</v>

111
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:21.123
<v Speaker 1>Such a dark view of our future would see</v>
<v Speaker 1>China isolating those who stand in </v>

112
00:06:24.801 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>opposition to or are not aligned with </v>
<v Speaker 1>its interests.</v>

113
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.580
<v Speaker 1>And then just eight days later the media</v>
<v Speaker 1>storm broke out.</v>

114
00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.410
<v Speaker 1>It says espionage and foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>interference against Australian interest</v>

115
00:06:36.411 --> 00:06:39.830
<v Speaker 1>is extensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several news organizations reported on a</v>

116
00:06:39.831 --> 00:06:40.664
<v Speaker 1>single story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Australian intelligence agency was </v>

117
00:06:42.771 --> 00:06:43.604
<v Speaker 1>making very serious warnings about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese government's intentions to </v>

118
00:06:46.641 --> 00:06:49.400
<v Speaker 1>influence Australian politics through </v>
<v Speaker 1>various means,</v>

119
00:06:49.430 --> 00:06:51.860
<v Speaker 1>including purchasing politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists,</v>

120
00:06:51.861 --> 00:06:52.694
<v Speaker 1>and scientists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these surveillance and intimidation </v>

121
00:06:54.381 --> 00:06:57.890
<v Speaker 1>of citizens belonging to the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>community in Australia.</v>

122
00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.940
<v Speaker 1>The scans it was unleashed suddenly </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew,</v>

123
00:07:01.941 --> 00:07:02.774
<v Speaker 1>started to emerge on the collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian universities and scientists </v>

124
00:07:06.081 --> 00:07:08.960
<v Speaker 1>with Chinese military contractors for </v>
<v Speaker 1>former politicians.</v>

125
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.540
<v Speaker 1>It's not chance the former Trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>Minister Andrew Rob,</v>

126
00:07:11.541 --> 00:07:12.374
<v Speaker 1>who now works for companies controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Chinese government in exchange </v>

127
00:07:15.081 --> 00:07:15.914
<v Speaker 1>for juicy salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but amount to hundreds of thousands of </v>

128
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:18.980
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>

129
00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:19.813
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

130
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.040
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Australian security services,</v>

131
00:07:23.041 --> 00:07:25.710
<v Speaker 1>fear of Chinese espionage certainly </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't new.</v>

132
00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:26.573
<v Speaker 1>Various Australian governments have been</v>
<v Speaker 1>blocking Chinese corporate operations </v>

133
00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:30.323
<v Speaker 1>for years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so I've also banned companies such </v>

134
00:07:32.101 --> 00:07:36.060
<v Speaker 1>as quite way from participating in </v>
<v Speaker 1>deploying a national broadband network.</v>

135
00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:36.923
<v Speaker 1>This is all precisely because of a fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>of espionage or excessive Chinese </v>

136
00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:41.400
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

137
00:07:41.401 --> 00:07:42.234
<v Speaker 1>despite everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy and tension had never gone </v>

138
00:07:44.551 --> 00:07:45.384
<v Speaker 1>this far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but reports have suggested that the </v>

139
00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.313
<v Speaker 1>Chinese Communist Party has been working</v>
<v Speaker 1>to covertly interfere with our media or </v>

140
00:07:51.211 --> 00:07:52.044
<v Speaker 1>universities and even the decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Elected representatives right here in </v>

141
00:07:55.111 --> 00:07:56.940
<v Speaker 1>this building in the parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Malcolm,</v>

142
00:08:00.970 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>on December the twelfth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

143
00:08:02.861 --> 00:08:03.694
<v Speaker 1>Sam Dastyari,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labor Party senator and one of the most </v>

144
00:08:05.561 --> 00:08:06.394
<v Speaker 1>promising political figures in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country was forced to resign because of </v>

145
00:08:08.951 --> 00:08:10.060
<v Speaker 1>his ties to China.</v>

146
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 2>I said earlier in the statement that I </v>
<v Speaker 2>am a patriotic Australian.</v>

147
00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:14.943
<v Speaker 2>I meant that with all my heart and I </v>
<v Speaker 2>leave the Senate with nothing but good </v>

148
00:08:19.481 --> 00:08:22.930
<v Speaker 2>thoughts for our country and for our </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

149
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.033
<v Speaker 1>Among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he was accused of receiving money in </v>

150
00:08:25.511 --> 00:08:26.344
<v Speaker 1>exchange for speeches that favored the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese government's interests and even </v>

151
00:08:29.231 --> 00:08:30.064
<v Speaker 1>have alerting a Chinese businessman </v>
<v Speaker 1>linked to the communist party that he </v>

152
00:08:32.351 --> 00:08:33.184
<v Speaker 1>could be being investigated by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia's intelligence agencies and </v>

153
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:36.754
<v Speaker 1>that his phone could be tapped well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scientists collaborating with Chinese </v>

154
00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:43.630
<v Speaker 1>military contractors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>university in filtration,</v>

155
00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.850
<v Speaker 1>paying journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying politicians.</v>

156
00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:49.090
<v Speaker 1>These accusations had been running since</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beginning of June.</v>

157
00:08:50.450 --> 00:08:51.283
<v Speaker 1>The Australian government announced it </v>
<v Speaker 1>publicly and began modifying its </v>

158
00:08:54.011 --> 00:08:56.070
<v Speaker 1>legislation on espionage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>treason,</v>

159
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.083
<v Speaker 1>immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on financing political parties and </v>

160
00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.333
<v Speaker 1>this dvr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like it's only just the </v>

161
00:09:02.251 --> 00:09:03.084
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is no secret that China is very </v>

162
00:09:05.971 --> 00:09:10.200
<v Speaker 1>active in intelligence activities </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed against us.</v>

163
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.440
<v Speaker 1>The consequences of these cooling </v>
<v Speaker 1>political relations can be seen.</v>

164
00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in foreign policy,</v>

165
00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:16.103
<v Speaker 1>we can clearly say that in 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia has been favoring the United </v>

166
00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:21.263
<v Speaker 1>States like never before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't think that this position has </v>

167
00:09:23.071 --> 00:09:26.070
<v Speaker 1>been unanimous among the political class</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at all.</v>

168
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:26.904
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government doesn't seem to </v>

169
00:09:28.261 --> 00:09:29.094
<v Speaker 1>understand the economic importance of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the relationship with China or the </v>

170
00:09:31.441 --> 00:09:32.274
<v Speaker 1>strategic issues involved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're putting all of our faith and our </v>

171
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>relationship with China through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy lens of the US,</v>

172
00:09:38.310 --> 00:09:40.590
<v Speaker 1>Paul Keating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australian former prime minister,</v>

173
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:43.200
<v Speaker 1>and you know what,</v>
<v Speaker 1>given the circumstances,</v>

174
00:09:43.201 --> 00:09:47.340
<v Speaker 1>I think that this entire database on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>position Australia should take regarding</v>

175
00:09:47.341 --> 00:09:48.950
<v Speaker 1>China is quite understanding.</v>

176
00:09:53.710 --> 00:09:54.543
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many critics affirmed that there isn't </v>

177
00:09:56.260 --> 00:09:57.093
<v Speaker 1>enough evidence of the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>interference that the government </v>

178
00:09:59.351 --> 00:10:00.184
<v Speaker 1>denounces some even say that this is all</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political operation fed by Washington </v>

179
00:10:04.630 --> 00:10:08.650
<v Speaker 1>now on the other is breaking with China </v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least being this forceful with the</v>

180
00:10:08.651 --> 00:10:11.680
<v Speaker 1>Beijing government isn't exactly easy </v>
<v Speaker 1>for Australia,</v>

181
00:10:11.730 --> 00:10:12.790
<v Speaker 1>and now you might be asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

182
00:10:12.791 --> 00:10:14.050
<v Speaker 1>why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:19.080
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China defends itself.</v>

184
00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:27.180
<v Speaker 1>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this entire political crisis.</v>

185
00:10:27.181 --> 00:10:28.014
<v Speaker 1>China has been very strong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course they have denied all </v>

186
00:10:31.081 --> 00:10:31.914
<v Speaker 1>accusations and have even said that this</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire campaign is based on racial </v>

187
00:10:35.371 --> 00:10:39.600
<v Speaker 1>prejudice and anti Chinese paranoia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This paranoia they've claimed is turning</v>

188
00:10:39.601 --> 00:10:43.980
<v Speaker 1>into clear hostility towards the Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 1>community in Australia itself.</v>

189
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.623
<v Speaker 1>Chinese diplomats warn students in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia to stay alert to safety risks </v>

190
00:10:48.570 --> 00:10:50.460
<v Speaker 1>after spate of attacks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

191
00:10:50.461 --> 00:10:52.560
<v Speaker 1>these types of messages may seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>exaggerated,</v>

192
00:10:52.561 --> 00:10:53.394
<v Speaker 1>especially because the truth is that </v>
<v Speaker 1>beyond a few posters in one university </v>

193
00:10:56.071 --> 00:10:56.904
<v Speaker 1>or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there seems to be no evidence of this </v>

194
00:10:59.041 --> 00:10:59.874
<v Speaker 1>acclaimed danger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but although this claim shows us how </v>

195
00:11:02.071 --> 00:11:02.904
<v Speaker 1>things off,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also kind of a warning because </v>

196
00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:09.620
<v Speaker 1>clearly it isn't good publicity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain myself.</v>

197
00:11:13.151 --> 00:11:14.920
<v Speaker 1>Yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese students account for four out of</v>

198
00:11:14.980 --> 00:11:15.813
<v Speaker 1>every 10 foreign students in Australian </v>
<v Speaker 1>universities and they spend </v>

199
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:22.750
<v Speaker 1>$18,000,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the country every single year.</v>

200
00:11:22.780 --> 00:11:23.613
<v Speaker 1>It seems that Xi Jinping's governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to make it very clear that it is </v>

201
00:11:26.201 --> 00:11:27.310
<v Speaker 1>willing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if necessary,</v>

202
00:11:27.370 --> 00:11:30.010
<v Speaker 1>to play in economic terms as a pressure </v>
<v Speaker 1>measure.</v>

203
00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.883
<v Speaker 1>This is something that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have used recently with both South </v>

204
00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Korea and Taiwan</v>

205
00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:39.390
<v Speaker 3>and</v>

206
00:11:39.390 --> 00:11:44.120
<v Speaker 1>we are only talking about students here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also about tourists and investors.</v>

207
00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.480
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in recent years,</v>

208
00:11:45.481 --> 00:11:46.314
<v Speaker 1>the luxury sector has experienced a huge</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic boom in Australia and you know </v>

209
00:11:49.891 --> 00:11:50.790
<v Speaker 1>why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

210
00:11:50.791 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 1>listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>students,</v>

211
00:11:52.840 --> 00:11:53.673
<v Speaker 1>tourists and Chinese residents in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia are responsible for up to two </v>

212
00:11:56.441 --> 00:11:57.274
<v Speaker 1>thirds of all luxury retail sales in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sydney and Melbourne and had as another </v>

213
00:12:00.671 --> 00:12:01.504
<v Speaker 1>example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China's direct investments in Australia </v>

214
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:08.080
<v Speaker 1>of multiplies not by 10 by 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but by 32 inches,</v>

215
00:12:08.081 --> 00:12:10.270
<v Speaker 1>nine years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so as you can see,</v>

216
00:12:10.271 --> 00:12:11.104
<v Speaker 1>slowing down this entire process could </v>
<v Speaker 1>translate into a lot and that is a lot </v>

217
00:12:15.491 --> 00:12:19.570
<v Speaker 1>of pain for the Australian economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but dear viewer,</v>

218
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:22.920
<v Speaker 1>that is simply the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>

219
00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.833
<v Speaker 1>the Australian government remains </v>
<v Speaker 1>faithful to its close relationship with </v>

220
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:27.034
<v Speaker 1>Washington.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States seems to have secured </v>

221
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:29.553
<v Speaker 1>an alliance that is essential for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>interests in this area of the world and </v>

222
00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:34.480
<v Speaker 1>for that military industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

223
00:12:34.481 --> 00:12:37.360
<v Speaker 1>Australia became one of the U.</v>
<v Speaker 1>s is best customers,</v>

224
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:38.223
<v Speaker 1>and in the next decade they expect to </v>
<v Speaker 1>spend more than a hundred billion </v>

225
00:12:40.931 --> 00:12:41.764
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Renewing their armed forces were </v>

226
00:12:43.241 --> 00:12:46.030
<v Speaker 1>American contractors have a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage.</v>

227
00:12:49.430 --> 00:12:50.263
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there all more than a few people then </v>

228
00:12:51.381 --> 00:12:53.150
<v Speaker 1>it's by people here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need politicians,</v>

229
00:12:53.151 --> 00:12:53.984
<v Speaker 1>businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and citizens to Australia to remain </v>

230
00:12:56.271 --> 00:12:57.104
<v Speaker 1>neutral and protect its national </v>
<v Speaker 1>security without having to make so many </v>

231
00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:03.170
<v Speaker 1>public accusations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now the question becomes,</v>

232
00:13:03.171 --> 00:13:05.180
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is this story going to end?</v>

233
00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most fruitful relationships </v>

234
00:13:07.341 --> 00:13:09.350
<v Speaker 1>in recent years be at risk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

235
