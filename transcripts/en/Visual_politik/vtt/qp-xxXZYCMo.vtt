1
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Is this someone controlling capitalism </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind the scenes?</v>

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.940
<v Speaker 1>You've heard about the Reptilians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rothschild family,</v>

3
00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.774
<v Speaker 1>even George Soros.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is one player with much more power </v>

4
00:00:15.671 --> 00:00:18.940
<v Speaker 1>than any of these guys and nobody's ever</v>
<v Speaker 1>told you about them.</v>

5
00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:23.140
<v Speaker 1>That of course is the government of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway.</v>

6
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:29.700
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

7
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.590
<v Speaker 1>No way is more than just a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very rich country.</v>

8
00:00:32.591 --> 00:00:37.110
<v Speaker 1>It's governments can have a real sway on</v>
<v Speaker 1>international businesses.</v>

9
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 1>Think I've gotten enough swell at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>end of this video.</v>

10
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.030
<v Speaker 1>You are absolutely going to see where </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm coming from.</v>

11
00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:52.393
<v Speaker 1>No way is the only country on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>where say tannic black metal songs are </v>

12
00:00:55.811 --> 00:00:57.540
<v Speaker 1>on the billboard shots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

13
00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:58.383
<v Speaker 1>My idea of you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you ever travel to this country and </v>

14
00:00:59.771 --> 00:01:02.380
<v Speaker 1>turn up your radio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might find yourself not listening to</v>

15
00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:06.190
<v Speaker 1>Taylor swift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead bands like kroger off man or</v>

16
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.260
<v Speaker 1>little meister and that famous hit </v>
<v Speaker 1>titled My ass.</v>

17
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.250
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yes,</v>

18
00:01:18.251 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 1>there might be something a little odd </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on with the music in this country,</v>

19
00:01:21.011 --> 00:01:21.844
<v Speaker 1>but Norway is one of the richest </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries on the planet's thing in the </v>

20
00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:28.780
<v Speaker 1>same league as Ireland and Switzerland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

21
00:01:28.781 --> 00:01:30.790
<v Speaker 1>they're also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the most egalitarian,</v>

22
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.720
<v Speaker 1>this means that the difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>the rich and the poor is fairness.</v>

23
00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.043
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

24
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:40.453
<v Speaker 1>That welfare state is big.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That taxes are high and their lifestyle </v>

25
00:01:43.551 --> 00:01:44.384
<v Speaker 1>is good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I'm betting yet already probably </v>

26
00:01:46.341 --> 00:01:47.174
<v Speaker 1>know this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What you probably don't know is that </v>

27
00:01:48.141 --> 00:01:52.040
<v Speaker 1>noise influence on the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy is way bigger than it looks.</v>

28
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:53.143
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway is behind the scenes of one of </v>

29
00:01:54.981 --> 00:01:57.350
<v Speaker 1>the biggest corporations on the planet,</v>

30
00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

31
00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.050
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't leave this video right now.</v>

32
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:05.160
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking and.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

33
00:02:05.161 --> 00:02:05.701
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

34
00:02:05.701 --> 00:02:10.410
<v Speaker 1>This video is most definitely not a </v>
<v Speaker 1>crossover with Alex Jones use no way.</v>

35
00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:13.230
<v Speaker 1>As a population of less than 5 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants,</v>

36
00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.810
<v Speaker 1>New York City has more people </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonetheless.</v>

37
00:02:15.811 --> 00:02:18.360
<v Speaker 1>These 5 million people have big shares </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the welds.</v>

38
00:02:18.361 --> 00:02:19.830
<v Speaker 1>Major corporations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

39
00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.723
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government of Norway has its own </v>

40
00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.033
<v Speaker 1>hedge fund and they are among the main </v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholders in a lot of companies like </v>

41
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.540
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook,</v>

42
00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.480
<v Speaker 1>and Tesla knowing might not have a big </v>
<v Speaker 1>tree,</v>

43
00:02:30.481 --> 00:02:34.560
<v Speaker 1>but they have an army of money ready to </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence the world's economy.</v>

44
00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:35.990
<v Speaker 1>So the question now is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

45
00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.070
<v Speaker 1>why is Norway so rich and powerful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How to do it now at this point?</v>

46
00:02:41.071 --> 00:02:43.400
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably all thinking the same thing and</v>

47
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.970
<v Speaker 1>that is probably oil and you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually kind of right.</v>

48
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Norway is one of the world's largest oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>producers,</v>

49
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 1>but they actually have nothing to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the other oil rich countries.</v>

50
00:02:55.321 --> 00:02:56.610
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at this picture.</v>

51
00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.110
<v Speaker 1>You can see the skylines of Riyadh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia</v>

52
00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:01.043
<v Speaker 2>conversation</v>

53
00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.160
<v Speaker 1>looks like a Scifi city of the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These skyscrapers,</v>

54
00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 1>modern buildings and blends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have lights.</v>

55
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.410
<v Speaker 1>Now we'll take a look at this picture of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oslo,</v>

56
00:03:12.411 --> 00:03:13.220
<v Speaker 1>the capital of</v>

57
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:14.053
<v Speaker 2>Norway.</v>

58
00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.533
<v Speaker 1>I probably see the difference right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been following visual politic </v>

59
00:03:20.461 --> 00:03:21.294
<v Speaker 1>for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know that having oil is not </v>

60
00:03:23.451 --> 00:03:25.520
<v Speaker 1>the same as being rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.110
<v Speaker 1>as you can see on this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Josh,</v>

62
00:03:27.111 --> 00:03:31.020
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian crude oil is twice as </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive to extract a Saudi</v>

63
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.660
<v Speaker 1>for a better understanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the Norwegian oil comes from the</v>

64
00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:43.840
<v Speaker 1>North Sea and these oil beds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if she had with other countries like the</v>

65
00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.870
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>however noise,</v>

66
00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.290
<v Speaker 1>taking the most advantage of that oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth.</v>

67
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.221
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

68
00:03:48.221 --> 00:03:50.140
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I know what you're probably thinking</v>

69
00:03:50.141 --> 00:03:51.050
<v Speaker 1>right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

70
00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:54.760
<v Speaker 1>this is another visual politic video </v>
<v Speaker 1>where Simon tells us how wonderful it is</v>

71
00:03:54.761 --> 00:03:58.000
<v Speaker 1>and how rich Norway God by privatizing </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

72
00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>right rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

73
00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.110
<v Speaker 1>actually this time the story is </v>
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>

74
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.290
<v Speaker 1>Norway is actually a great example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>state capitalism.</v>

75
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:06.820
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

76
00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:10.360
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is state capitalism?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why is no way so rich and powerful?</v>

77
00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.040
<v Speaker 1>11 answer the question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

78
00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.760
<v Speaker 1>and what does it mean for a government </v>
<v Speaker 1>to invest in the stock market?</v>

79
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.743
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not worry because today we're going </v>

80
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:21.280
<v Speaker 1>to answer these questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as always before we do that,</v>

81
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:23.140
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look back at the history,</v>

82
00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:29.653
<v Speaker 1>the Dutch disease.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So I do need to be honest here because </v>

83
00:04:31.851 --> 00:04:34.250
<v Speaker 1>Norway is never exactly been a poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

84
00:04:34.251 --> 00:04:36.860
<v Speaker 1>but it wasn't exactly always a wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>one either.</v>

85
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:37.813
<v Speaker 1>In the 19 fifties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians enjoyed a lifestyle similar </v>

86
00:04:40.191 --> 00:04:43.280
<v Speaker 1>to that of the French.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means wealthier than the Spaniards,</v>

87
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:46.700
<v Speaker 1>but poorer than this Swedish neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course the Americans.</v>

88
00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.300
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody expected Norway to have oil,</v>

89
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things change dramatically.</v>

90
00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.473
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 59 and that moment shell </v>
<v Speaker 1>started respecting in the North Sea </v>

91
00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.120
<v Speaker 1>shells in oil company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the Netherlands,</v>

92
00:04:59.121 --> 00:05:02.080
<v Speaker 1>and they were looking for potential oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>beds in the shores of that</v>

93
00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:03.003
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

94
00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.010
<v Speaker 1>One day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

95
00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.050
<v Speaker 1>They found little gas sources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>whenever that is gas and oil,</v>

96
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.000
<v Speaker 1>so they kept up their exploration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how one of the biggest oil field</v>

97
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:17.834
<v Speaker 1>in the world was discovered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>An oilfield situated under British </v>

98
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:22.580
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian waters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the 19 sixties,</v>

99
00:05:22.581 --> 00:05:26.600
<v Speaker 1>Sharon got drilling licenses in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>two countries years later in 1972,</v>

100
00:05:26.601 --> 00:05:29.570
<v Speaker 1>the Norwegian government founded its own</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil company.</v>

101
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:31.400
<v Speaker 1>Stat oil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fresh.</v>

102
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.520
<v Speaker 1>You're married.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then you start on this.</v>

103
00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.770
<v Speaker 1>This is how the North Sea oil boom </v>
<v Speaker 1>started.</v>

104
00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.460
<v Speaker 1>During the 19 seventies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money flew into this country.</v>

105
00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.300
<v Speaker 1>In just three years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians doubled their GDP per capita.</v>

106
00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.220
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden the Norwegian dream and </v>
<v Speaker 1>working in the dinosaur juice industry,</v>

107
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:53.383
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who really wants to go fishing for </v>

108
00:05:54.351 --> 00:05:59.351
<v Speaker 1>salmon when you can make a lot of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>working with and gas right now,</v>

109
00:06:01.821 --> 00:06:04.160
<v Speaker 1>it all might be sounding pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic to you.</v>

110
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually it's not.</v>

111
00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:08.330
<v Speaker 1>In fact this phenomenon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the.</v>

112
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:09.164
<v Speaker 1>It has a name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they call it the Dutch disease or the </v>

113
00:06:11.241 --> 00:06:12.890
<v Speaker 1>cost of natural resources.</v>

114
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:22.560
<v Speaker 1>Basically anytime the country finds oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its economy goes nuts,</v>

115
00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:26.610
<v Speaker 1>the government couldn't waste piles of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money while still lowering taxes,</v>

116
00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:27.503
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to work in the oil industry </v>

117
00:06:28.651 --> 00:06:31.410
<v Speaker 1>because it's the most profitable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:06:31.411 --> 00:06:33.810
<v Speaker 1>what happens next few years you were </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming in.</v>

119
00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Just one thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dinosaur,</v>

120
00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:36.453
<v Speaker 1>Jason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you depend so much on a single </v>

121
00:06:38.251 --> 00:06:39.084
<v Speaker 1>product,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a small change in the market price puts </v>

122
00:06:41.431 --> 00:06:44.490
<v Speaker 1>the whole country on the verge of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankruptcy.</v>

123
00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:48.510
<v Speaker 1>This is exactly what's happened in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela and what could happen in other</v>

124
00:06:48.511 --> 00:06:52.020
<v Speaker 1>countries like Saudi Arabia or Bahrain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

125
00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.620
<v Speaker 1>This was the big difference between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway and the United Kingdom.</v>

126
00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.453
<v Speaker 1>Both countries have labor governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but their policies couldn't be more </v>

127
00:07:03.131 --> 00:07:05.710
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the year 1976,</v>

128
00:07:05.711 --> 00:07:09.160
<v Speaker 1>the UK was in the middle of one of their</v>
<v Speaker 1>worst financial crises.</v>

129
00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.460
<v Speaker 1>The government couldn't wait to squeeze </v>
<v Speaker 1>that oil wealth for all.</v>

130
00:07:12.461 --> 00:07:14.110
<v Speaker 1>It was worth Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

131
00:07:14.111 --> 00:07:17.770
<v Speaker 1>they had a more stable situation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they could wait so well.</v>

132
00:07:17.771 --> 00:07:18.880
<v Speaker 1>What does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

133
00:07:18.881 --> 00:07:22.000
<v Speaker 1>first the government put very strict </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry regulations in place.</v>

134
00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:22.953
<v Speaker 1>Plus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>50 percent of those are eggs had to be </v>

135
00:07:24.341 --> 00:07:26.290
<v Speaker 1>in the hands of the state owned oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

136
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:27.423
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies have to pay a 78 </v>

137
00:07:29.381 --> 00:07:32.560
<v Speaker 1>percent tax on the profits and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

138
00:07:32.650 --> 00:07:34.780
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Put a limit on oil production.</v>

139
00:07:35.110 --> 00:07:36.010
<v Speaker 1>Just look at ms dot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

140
00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:41.353
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see whether UK kickstarted that </v>

141
00:07:42.801 --> 00:07:44.600
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the 19 seventies,</v>

142
00:07:44.601 --> 00:07:45.434
<v Speaker 1>the British were already producing more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a million and a half barrels a day </v>

143
00:07:48.260 --> 00:07:49.093
<v Speaker 1>while Norway was still doing a third of </v>
<v Speaker 1>that during the eighties during the </v>

144
00:07:51.771 --> 00:07:52.604
<v Speaker 1>Margaret Thatcher administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK kept pumping oil like there was </v>

145
00:07:55.641 --> 00:07:56.474
<v Speaker 1>no tomorrow while Norway was still </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much relaxed about the </v>

146
00:07:58.671 --> 00:08:01.730
<v Speaker 1>production.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what did they achieve by doing this?</v>

147
00:08:01.850 --> 00:08:04.850
<v Speaker 1>Norway was keeping the productive </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy focused on oil,</v>

148
00:08:04.851 --> 00:08:07.460
<v Speaker 1>but just wait a minute because there's </v>
<v Speaker 1>another big difference</v>

149
00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:12.133
<v Speaker 1>you see during the eighties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thatcher private domains to British </v>

150
00:08:14.570 --> 00:08:15.403
<v Speaker 1>Petroleum.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway's governments by contrast kept </v>

151
00:08:16.671 --> 00:08:17.504
<v Speaker 1>control of start on even today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>display the company changing its name </v>

152
00:08:20.031 --> 00:08:20.864
<v Speaker 1>from [inaudible] to Ecuador.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That state still owns 67 percent of the </v>

153
00:08:23.991 --> 00:08:24.711
<v Speaker 1>fun.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

154
00:08:24.711 --> 00:08:25.690
<v Speaker 1>so now you might be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

155
00:08:25.691 --> 00:08:26.690
<v Speaker 1>oh my God,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so wait,</v>

156
00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.553
<v Speaker 1>noise a socialist country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just hold on a second because the </v>

157
00:08:30.471 --> 00:08:33.410
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian economic system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's actually kind of similar to that of</v>

158
00:08:33.411 --> 00:08:37.940
<v Speaker 1>China and this is what experts are </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling state capitalism.</v>

159
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:40.880
<v Speaker 1>This means that the state controls a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good share of the economy,</v>

160
00:08:40.881 --> 00:08:43.340
<v Speaker 1>but it behaves like a big private </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

161
00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:45.620
<v Speaker 1>So what does that mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.650
<v Speaker 1>check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The hedge fund country.</v>

163
00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.570
<v Speaker 1>Now before we continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I should make an aside here because this</v>

164
00:08:57.571 --> 00:09:01.500
<v Speaker 1>beautiful romantic and sweet melody or </v>
<v Speaker 1>hearing right now is the music of end of</v>

165
00:09:01.501 --> 00:09:02.334
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A black metal band that's from not from </v>

166
00:09:04.021 --> 00:09:04.854
<v Speaker 1>Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're actually from Columbia that it </v>

167
00:09:06.181 --> 00:09:10.290
<v Speaker 1>sounds just like a Norwegian bands and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they sent us their music for this video.</v>

168
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.273
<v Speaker 1>If you want to hear more of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we haven't linked to their channel in </v>

169
00:09:13.651 --> 00:09:14.370
<v Speaker 1>the description,</v>

170
00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:15.203
<v Speaker 4>the light.</v>

171
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:22.990
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>back to our stories.</v>

172
00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:24.093
<v Speaker 1>Do you remember the two pictures I </v>
<v Speaker 1>showed you at the beginning of this </v>

173
00:09:25.541 --> 00:09:26.351
<v Speaker 1>video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:09:26.351 --> 00:09:27.184
<v Speaker 1>the countries like Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used their impressive or wealth to </v>

175
00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:31.900
<v Speaker 1>live like a hip hop artist on a Friday </v>
<v Speaker 1>night.</v>

176
00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:34.660
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the different Norwegian administrations,</v>

177
00:09:34.661 --> 00:09:39.100
<v Speaker 1>both labor and conservative have </v>
<v Speaker 1>measured every last penny they've spent.</v>

178
00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.750
<v Speaker 1>And so what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

179
00:09:40.751 --> 00:09:43.210
<v Speaker 1>that oil wealth and went into a piggy </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank,</v>

180
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:46.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is how we go to the year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1990 in this year,</v>

181
00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:49.090
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian parliament,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they realize three things.</v>

182
00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:52.030
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have a lot of savings to all market</v>

183
00:09:52.031 --> 00:09:54.550
<v Speaker 1>prices go up and down and they cannot </v>
<v Speaker 1>control that.</v>

184
00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:55.533
<v Speaker 1>And three,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the best thing they can do is diversify </v>

185
00:09:58.211 --> 00:10:01.090
<v Speaker 1>their economy as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How could they do that?</v>

186
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how about investing in the stock?</v>

187
00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:04.830
<v Speaker 4>Gotcha.</v>

188
00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:10.350
<v Speaker 1>I have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So as we say here,</v>

189
00:10:10.351 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>a visual politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So it was that insert was done.</v>

190
00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:16.800
<v Speaker 1>This is how the government pension fund </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Norway also known as the oil fund was</v>

191
00:10:16.801 --> 00:10:17.634
<v Speaker 1>created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a hedge fund controlled by the </v>

192
00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:21.720
<v Speaker 1>Norwegian Central Bank as they might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking,</v>

193
00:10:21.721 --> 00:10:22.501
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh yeah,</v>

194
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 1>but what's so impressive about that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are other countries,</v>

195
00:10:24.901 --> 00:10:27.750
<v Speaker 1>but sovereign wealth funds China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's Australia,</v>

196
00:10:27.751 --> 00:10:30.810
<v Speaker 1>there's the United Arab Emirates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

197
00:10:30.840 --> 00:10:31.673
<v Speaker 1>that is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is one of the biggest of them </v>

198
00:10:35.161 --> 00:10:38.940
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about more than a trillion</v>

199
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:39.773
<v Speaker 1>American dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that if we divide up this </v>

200
00:10:40.831 --> 00:10:45.831
<v Speaker 1>fund by the entire Norwegian population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>each citizen has more than $200,000</v>

201
00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:50.580
<v Speaker 1>invested in stocks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the end of the story.</v>

202
00:10:50.730 --> 00:10:51.563
<v Speaker 1>According to the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody can touch that money for any </v>

203
00:10:53.730 --> 00:10:54.563
<v Speaker 1>public spending.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the government can only </v>

204
00:10:55.921 --> 00:10:58.650
<v Speaker 1>use the benefits of the fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but never the capital.</v>

205
00:10:58.740 --> 00:10:59.573
<v Speaker 1>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are not talking about a small amount </v>

206
00:11:01.711 --> 00:11:02.080
<v Speaker 1>of money.</v>

207
00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:02.913
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

208
00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:11.950
<v Speaker 1>Norway's sovereign wealth fund made </v>
<v Speaker 1>$130,000,000,000</v>

209
00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:13.780
<v Speaker 1>in one year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

210
00:11:13.781 --> 00:11:14.614
<v Speaker 1>according to the law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they cannot invest in their local </v>

211
00:11:16.001 --> 00:11:19.390
<v Speaker 1>economy only in foreign companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why today,</v>

212
00:11:19.391 --> 00:11:24.391
<v Speaker 1>Norway holds one point five percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of the stocks existing in the entire</v>

213
00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:26.410
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

214
00:11:26.411 --> 00:11:27.244
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some years are better than others and </v>

215
00:11:28.331 --> 00:11:29.164
<v Speaker 1>according to many analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the management of the fund is overly </v>

216
00:11:31.571 --> 00:11:34.090
<v Speaker 1>conservative and it doesn't make as much</v>
<v Speaker 1>money as they could,</v>

217
00:11:34.300 --> 00:11:35.133
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway doesn't just use this for </v>

218
00:11:36.970 --> 00:11:37.803
<v Speaker 1>diversification.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all fund is also a political </v>

219
00:11:40.091 --> 00:11:45.091
<v Speaker 1>weapon.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway's 900,</v>

220
00:11:45.270 --> 00:11:50.050
<v Speaker 1>$5 billion dollar oil fund flexes its </v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholder muscles,</v>

221
00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:54.730
<v Speaker 1>world's largest sovereign wealth fund,</v>
<v Speaker 1>opposed 6,700</v>

222
00:11:54.731 --> 00:11:56.320
<v Speaker 1>company resolutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Last year,</v>

223
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:57.213
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every year the Norwegian central bank </v>

224
00:11:58.931 --> 00:11:59.764
<v Speaker 1>pushes a blacklist with companies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't invest in for ethical </v>

225
00:12:02.261 --> 00:12:04.750
<v Speaker 1>reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This includes weapons manufacturers,</v>

226
00:12:04.751 --> 00:12:08.260
<v Speaker 1>tobacco producers and firms involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>corruption scandals,</v>

227
00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:10.210
<v Speaker 1>but this is just the beginning.</v>

228
00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.103
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having stocks of a publicly traded </v>

229
00:12:12.341 --> 00:12:13.174
<v Speaker 1>company gives you the right to </v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in the shareholder's </v>

230
00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:15.873
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can vote on corporate decisions and </v>

231
00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:20.590
<v Speaker 1>even suggest topics for discussion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The more stocks you have,</v>

232
00:12:20.591 --> 00:12:23.080
<v Speaker 1>the more important you are in those </v>
<v Speaker 1>meetings.</v>

233
00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:26.220
<v Speaker 1>Is an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This past summer 2018,</v>

234
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:28.930
<v Speaker 1>facebook started in new algorithms to </v>
<v Speaker 1>filter fake news.</v>

235
00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.480
<v Speaker 1>They also started to take the wage gap </v>
<v Speaker 1>seriously.</v>

236
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:34.840
<v Speaker 1>These two decisions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the outcome of a shareholder meeting</v>

237
00:12:35.080 --> 00:12:37.990
<v Speaker 1>and guess you added those topics in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>meeting schedule.</v>

238
00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:39.171
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

239
00:12:39.171 --> 00:12:40.004
<v Speaker 1>it was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No Way.</v>

240
00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.070
<v Speaker 1>And the same also happens with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

241
00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:52.210
<v Speaker 1>Norway's Fund backs activists bid at </v>
<v Speaker 1>alphabet meeting.</v>

242
00:12:52.420 --> 00:12:53.253
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns </v>

243
00:12:54.970 --> 00:12:58.150
<v Speaker 1>Google and Youtube.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A small group of shells is wanted google</v>

244
00:12:58.151 --> 00:12:58.984
<v Speaker 1>to refine the fake news filter and </v>
<v Speaker 1>having the support of Norway's Fund </v>

245
00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:06.370
<v Speaker 1>helps them at win very crucial votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same thing happens with apple.</v>

246
00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:08.980
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway is the eighth biggest shareholder</v>

247
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:09.993
<v Speaker 1>with more than 9 billion US dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>invested and they aren't exactly silent </v>

248
00:13:13.121 --> 00:13:13.954
<v Speaker 1>in the shareholder meetings in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway is pushing some of the world's </v>

249
00:13:16.511 --> 00:13:17.344
<v Speaker 1>biggest companies to change their </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate policies on many different </v>

250
00:13:19.271 --> 00:13:20.290
<v Speaker 1>fronts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

251
00:13:20.291 --> 00:13:22.540
<v Speaker 1>there's the gender gap that that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one.</v>

252
00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:25.320
<v Speaker 1>Part of the Norwegian ideology focuses </v>
<v Speaker 1>on this</v>

253
00:13:25.410 --> 00:13:26.243
<v Speaker 2>two</v>

254
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.080
<v Speaker 1>Norway sovereign fund to focus on high </v>
<v Speaker 1>executive pay.</v>

255
00:13:35.170 --> 00:13:36.003
<v Speaker 1>In many ways,</v>
<v Speaker 1>big multinational executives make a big </v>

256
00:13:37.751 --> 00:13:39.880
<v Speaker 1>sign of aries despite the company losing</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

257
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.370
<v Speaker 1>We saw this several times during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis.</v>

258
00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:43.233
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>shareholders of these companies are not </v>

259
00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:48.280
<v Speaker 1>exactly happy with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's hard to speak out when you only</v>

260
00:13:48.281 --> 00:13:50.110
<v Speaker 1>hold a small number of shares in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

261
00:13:50.230 --> 00:13:51.063
<v Speaker 1>and this is where Norway comes in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it's a loudspeaker for smaller </v>

262
00:13:54.281 --> 00:13:55.114
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many countries trying to control the </v>

263
00:13:56.711 --> 00:13:57.544
<v Speaker 1>world within militaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries trying to sway foreign </v>

264
00:13:59.831 --> 00:14:00.664
<v Speaker 1>governments with diplomacy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway expands their power through </v>

265
00:14:03.701 --> 00:14:06.250
<v Speaker 1>influence on the biggest global </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

266
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:07.383
<v Speaker 1>and this is the Norwegian conspiracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but meanwhile Norwegian citizens can </v>

267
00:14:10.931 --> 00:14:14.170
<v Speaker 1>sleep at night knowing that even if oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>prices go down,</v>

268
00:14:14.171 --> 00:14:16.180
<v Speaker 1>they have their futures guaranteed,</v>

269
00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:22.533
<v Speaker 1>and now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think it's a good idea for a </v>

270
00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:26.320
<v Speaker 1>whole country to invest in the stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market?</v>

271
00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:30.430
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the Norwegian </v>
<v Speaker 1>influences good for global capitalism?</v>

272
00:14:30.730 --> 00:14:32.050
<v Speaker 1>What do you think it's bad?</v>
