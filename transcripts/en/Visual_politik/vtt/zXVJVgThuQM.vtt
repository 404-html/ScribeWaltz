00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.050
<v Speaker 1>Tina is a country famous for three </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

2
00:00:10.051 --> 00:00:13.410
<v Speaker 1>tango,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer and economic crises.</v>

3
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.100
<v Speaker 1>Although that latter one might change </v>
<v Speaker 1>sooner rather than later.</v>

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dvo once again,</v>

5
00:00:18.211 --> 00:00:19.044
<v Speaker 1>we aren't talking about lithium or white</v>
<v Speaker 1>gold or the new oil and it's the staff </v>

6
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:26.310
<v Speaker 1>that have batteries are made out of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lithium is what powers your smart phone,</v>

7
00:00:26.311 --> 00:00:29.250
<v Speaker 1>your laptop and maybe even your electric</v>
<v Speaker 1>car.</v>

8
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.403
<v Speaker 1>As we said in this other video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is alongside with Chile and </v>

9
00:00:36.381 --> 00:00:37.214
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the three countries that make up </v>

10
00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:39.614
<v Speaker 1>this so called lithium triangle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is an area where 60 to 80% of the </v>

11
00:00:43.161 --> 00:00:46.880
<v Speaker 1>welds discovered lithium reserves are </v>
<v Speaker 1>concentrated from these three countries.</v>

12
00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:50.240
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is getting the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>detention like international investors.</v>

13
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.460
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

14
00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>That writes the biggest hedge funds have</v>
<v Speaker 1>their eyes on this country.</v>

15
00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.273
<v Speaker 1>This is a big surprise given the dodge </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Tina used to be the boogie man of </v>

16
00:01:02.341 --> 00:01:05.940
<v Speaker 1>finances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem childs of economics now,</v>

17
00:01:05.941 --> 00:01:06.774
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's growing into something of a </v>

18
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:12.430
<v Speaker 1>rockstar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry.</v>

19
00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:13.540
<v Speaker 1>Today's question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

20
00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:17.030
<v Speaker 1>what happens to this country in which </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their image in assumption,</v>

21
00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:17.864
<v Speaker 1>short time?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can they really become the leader over </v>

22
00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:22.420
<v Speaker 1>the lithium race is most important of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all?</v>

23
00:01:22.421 --> 00:01:26.500
<v Speaker 1>Can Lithium turn Argentina into a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abu Darby today?</v>

24
00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:28.600
<v Speaker 1>We all goings on.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So all of these questions,</v>

25
00:01:28.601 --> 00:01:31.730
<v Speaker 1>but before we get started,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the history.</v>

26
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 3>Argentina first.</v>

27
00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:36.573
<v Speaker 1>In the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina had become something of a </v>

28
00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:38.734
<v Speaker 1>boogie man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hedge funds under the presidency of </v>

29
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:43.510
<v Speaker 1>Cristina Fernandez de catch.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now Argentina's governance did it.</v>

30
00:01:43.511 --> 00:01:47.440
<v Speaker 1>Whatever they could to scare away any </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign company you might want to invest</v>

31
00:01:47.441 --> 00:01:47.780
<v Speaker 1>in the</v>

32
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.780
<v Speaker 4>treat tobacco.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Of course it [inaudible]</v>

33
00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.540
<v Speaker 3>when it comes to the mining and oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry.</v>

34
00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:59.433
<v Speaker 3>Kirschner made an interesting move.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In 2008 she passed a law against the </v>

35
00:02:02.411 --> 00:02:03.244
<v Speaker 3>repatriation of capital.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This means that if an Australian mining </v>

36
00:02:06.011 --> 00:02:10.510
<v Speaker 3>company made profit by extracting oil </v>
<v Speaker 3>and minerals on Argentinian soil,</v>

37
00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:11.373
<v Speaker 3>the government wouldn't allow the </v>
<v Speaker 3>company to send that money back to </v>

38
00:02:13.451 --> 00:02:14.284
<v Speaker 3>Australia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Coach's goal was to force these foreign </v>

39
00:02:17.781 --> 00:02:21.080
<v Speaker 3>companies to keep the financial benefits</v>
<v Speaker 3>of their mining in the country</v>

40
00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.020
<v Speaker 1>math or the last.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

41
00:02:23.021 --> 00:02:23.854
<v Speaker 1>the consequence of this law was that </v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the foreign companies simply </v>

42
00:02:26.381 --> 00:02:29.560
<v Speaker 1>stops doing business in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ends of the day.</v>

43
00:02:29.561 --> 00:02:30.910
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why would they,</v>

44
00:02:30.911 --> 00:02:33.610
<v Speaker 1>if it was forbidden to enjoy those </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits at home?</v>

45
00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

46
00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:35.703
<v Speaker 1>it was not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The real turning point for Argentina </v>

47
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>came in the year 2012</v>

48
00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.700
<v Speaker 3>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 3>x rates ypf to rub salt</v>

49
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:45.723
<v Speaker 1>repsol all of the largest oil company in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain in the year 1998 and merged with </v>

50
00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:50.014
<v Speaker 1>Arjun time company Y F for many years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this brands was simply called at Repsol </v>

51
00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.781
<v Speaker 1>Ypf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But one day,</v>

52
00:02:55.781 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Cristina Fernandez de Koechner in a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump fashion sense,</v>

53
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.993
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina first Hashtag make Argentina </v>

54
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:06.330
<v Speaker 1>grades again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He lets him a key.</v>

55
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.443
<v Speaker 1>How does that stay here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even if their shareholders are </v>

56
00:03:10.241 --> 00:03:14.250
<v Speaker 1>foreigners are Argentinian competence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now you might wonder,</v>

57
00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:16.010
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens next?</v>

58
00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.053
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the repsol pursued several </v>

59
00:03:18.351 --> 00:03:20.330
<v Speaker 1>lawsuits with the governments of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

60
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:24.230
<v Speaker 1>but this was not the worst thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest problem was that after being</v>

61
00:03:24.231 --> 00:03:27.800
<v Speaker 1>nationalized Argentine YDF,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reduced their oil production.</v>

62
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.683
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

63
00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:38.110
<v Speaker 1>wheel production extends decline as rig </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity slows.</v>

64
00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.510
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>Listen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>

66
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:40.570
<v Speaker 1>You're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:41.433
<v Speaker 1>what's the connection between oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and it's being owned by </v>

68
00:03:43.871 --> 00:03:46.570
<v Speaker 1>private companies or being owned by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments?</v>

69
00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.020
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are several states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil companies that work really well.</v>

70
00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.973
<v Speaker 1>For one example there is Aramco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the biggest dinosaur juice </v>

71
00:03:53.741 --> 00:03:55.180
<v Speaker 1>producer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm still,</v>

72
00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.010
<v Speaker 1>it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm buying the Saudi government's.</v>

73
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.800
<v Speaker 1>The problem here is that both in the oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>ams,</v>

74
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.380
<v Speaker 1>the mining industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need high tech.</v>

75
00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:03.423
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

76
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.060
<v Speaker 1>Each company has different technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and patents.</v>

77
00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.923
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when why the f wants it to drill those </v>

78
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:11.204
<v Speaker 1>oil beds of Baca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm wet and they needed to utilize a </v>

79
00:04:13.671 --> 00:04:18.200
<v Speaker 1>complicated technology called fracking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am as well only a few companies in the</v>

80
00:04:18.201 --> 00:04:21.740
<v Speaker 1>wells that have the machines and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>skills to do this kind of work.</v>

81
00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:23.870
<v Speaker 1>This is why it is so common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference.</v>

82
00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.733
<v Speaker 1>Oil companies create a joint venture to </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploit an oil bat when reps old left </v>

83
00:04:28.581 --> 00:04:31.520
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why p have lost a technology partner and</v>

84
00:04:31.521 --> 00:04:32.354
<v Speaker 1>this is why people will say the catch </v>
<v Speaker 1>near fought against those Spanish near </v>

85
00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:38.300
<v Speaker 1>Liberals and ended up partnering with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the American ones.</v>

86
00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

87
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.420
<v Speaker 1>YPF signed one point $5 billion shale </v>
<v Speaker 1>oil deal.</v>

88
00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.270
<v Speaker 1>Hold on just a second because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:48.143
<v Speaker 1>this isn't the end of our story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The biggest issue here is what happens </v>

90
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.520
<v Speaker 1>when you take over a company from one </v>
<v Speaker 1>day to the other.</v>

91
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what happens is the rest of the </v>

92
00:04:55.051 --> 00:04:58.950
<v Speaker 1>businesses are going to be afraid of you</v>
<v Speaker 1>and good luck trying to convince them to</v>

93
00:04:58.951 --> 00:05:03.951
<v Speaker 1>invest in your country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>

94
00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine you have an oil or a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mining company.</v>

95
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:07.763
<v Speaker 1>Would you really dead set up a factory </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the loss of facilities in a place </v>

96
00:05:10.321 --> 00:05:12.420
<v Speaker 1>where the government can just sees all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that from you.</v>

97
00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.810
<v Speaker 1>I think not man's this among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>factors.</v>

98
00:05:15.811 --> 00:05:20.010
<v Speaker 1>This is what explains why Argentina </v>
<v Speaker 1>today has such a big crisis,</v>

99
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.280
<v Speaker 1>but now Argentina has a president called</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maury,</v>

100
00:05:22.281 --> 00:05:26.080
<v Speaker 1>Theo Macri man's well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the times they are a changing.</v>

101
00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.353
<v Speaker 5>Okay.</v>

102
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:32.783
<v Speaker 1>Gold rush in Argentina and December,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2015 macri took his place in the pink </v>

103
00:05:37.021 --> 00:05:39.150
<v Speaker 1>house.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pink House is the elgin time version</v>

104
00:05:39.151 --> 00:05:39.984
<v Speaker 1>of the White House.</v>

105
00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.160
<v Speaker 2>That was the country I'm</v>

106
00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.993
<v Speaker 1>tree in the middle of a bankruptcy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real inflation was higher than 40% </v>

107
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.133
<v Speaker 1>dollars were sold on the black market </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there was no company willing to </v>

108
00:05:52.871 --> 00:05:53.704
<v Speaker 1>invest in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And all of this was despite them being </v>

109
00:05:56.291 --> 00:05:59.510
<v Speaker 1>one of the wealthiest countries when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to natural resources.</v>

110
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.373
<v Speaker 1>This is why since the very first moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macri has tried to conduct a 180 degree </v>

111
00:06:05.061 --> 00:06:07.320
<v Speaker 1>shift compared to what his predessessors</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

112
00:06:07.410 --> 00:06:08.243
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

113
00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:12.520
<v Speaker 3>Argentina's new government scraps,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mining taxes.</v>

114
00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.493
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macri knows that lithium is a pls </v>

115
00:06:15.571 --> 00:06:17.850
<v Speaker 1>opportunity to repair the accounting </v>
<v Speaker 1>books.</v>

116
00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:19.620
<v Speaker 1>Of course not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No one expects Argentine.</v>

117
00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:20.503
<v Speaker 1>And to become a new Dubai over night </v>
<v Speaker 1>that this white gold is a windfall and </v>

118
00:06:24.841 --> 00:06:28.710
<v Speaker 1>that money could cover the gaps of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina's budget without raising taxes</v>

119
00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.960
<v Speaker 1>and without cutting costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And as well,</v>

120
00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:32.640
<v Speaker 1>this explains laws like this,</v>

121
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.050
<v Speaker 5>Margie,</v>

122
00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:36.883
<v Speaker 3>Tina signs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>mining deal to unified regulations </v>

123
00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 3>attract investment.</v>

124
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:40.863
<v Speaker 1>In other words from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mining multinationals have an open door </v>

125
00:06:43.271 --> 00:06:44.104
<v Speaker 1>to the country and unlike what happens </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the coach and the era of these </v>

126
00:06:46.991 --> 00:06:49.810
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies can do whatever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>want with their profits.</v>

127
00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:50.763
<v Speaker 1>This is happening because Macri has </v>
<v Speaker 1>removed the anti repatriation law as if </v>

128
00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:55.234
<v Speaker 1>this was not enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legislation has been put into facts </v>

129
00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.410
<v Speaker 1>which unifies mining regulations all </v>
<v Speaker 1>across the country.</v>

130
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:03.790
<v Speaker 1>This means that the rules are the same </v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where the lithium battery is.</v>

131
00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:04.624
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mining companies will not have to </v>

132
00:07:05.501 --> 00:07:07.240
<v Speaker 1>pay any special mining tax in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

136
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.630
<v Speaker 3>new lithium operations</v>

137
00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:23.483
<v Speaker 5>in Argentina.</v>

138
00:07:26.210 --> 00:07:28.640
<v Speaker 1>Pause.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on for just a second because well,</v>

139
00:07:28.641 --> 00:07:31.700
<v Speaker 1>things they are not quite as great as </v>
<v Speaker 1>they seem.</v>

140
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:36.110
<v Speaker 1>Lithium is a great opportunity for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina bars.</v>

141
00:07:36.140 --> 00:07:36.973
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having natural resources does not mean </v>

142
00:07:38.931 --> 00:07:39.764
<v Speaker 1>your country isn't necessarily wealthy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many entre into Indians fear what they </v>

143
00:07:42.741 --> 00:07:43.574
<v Speaker 1>would call a new Potosi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means is that they fear that their </v>

144
00:07:45.861 --> 00:07:46.694
<v Speaker 1>country would become flooded with </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies that take the </v>

145
00:07:48.951 --> 00:07:52.730
<v Speaker 1>resources and leave without bringing any</v>
<v Speaker 1>money in to Argentina.</v>

146
00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:53.593
<v Speaker 1>So the question now becomes what can </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina do to avoid such a </v>

147
00:07:56.991 --> 00:07:57.824
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe?</v>

148
00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:00.493
<v Speaker 6>Yeah,</v>

149
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:05.640
<v Speaker 2>really</v>

150
00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:06.480
<v Speaker 3>chance of origin.</v>

151
00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.483
<v Speaker 2>Tina</v>

152
00:08:09.270 --> 00:08:10.103
<v Speaker 1>said in a previous video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the real business of lithium is not </v>

153
00:08:12.611 --> 00:08:13.444
<v Speaker 1>lithium itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to the added value products you can </v>

154
00:08:15.581 --> 00:08:16.410
<v Speaker 1>manufacture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:21.410
<v Speaker 2>With us at the time</v>

156
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.903
<v Speaker 1>when we recorded this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a metric ton of lithium had a market </v>

157
00:08:25.281 --> 00:08:29.510
<v Speaker 1>price of $9,000 nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we take that raw material and then we</v>

158
00:08:29.511 --> 00:08:30.344
<v Speaker 1>turned it into mobile phone batteries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could get an income of between 1.5 </v>

159
00:08:33.801 --> 00:08:36.080
<v Speaker 1>and $5 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

160
00:08:36.081 --> 00:08:40.550
<v Speaker 1>this is a very rough estimation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it does help us understand something</v>

161
00:08:40.551 --> 00:08:41.384
<v Speaker 1>important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on just a moment because this is </v>

162
00:08:45.141 --> 00:08:46.620
<v Speaker 1>still mode as simple as it looks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>works</v>

163
00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:50.040
<v Speaker 3>muscle lithium battery factories are in </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries like the United States,</v>

164
00:08:50.041 --> 00:08:51.750
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>or of course China.</v>

165
00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.613
<v Speaker 3>These three countries have worldclass </v>
<v Speaker 3>network of small companies provide </v>

166
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:58.150
<v Speaker 3>services and components to the big </v>
<v Speaker 3>manufacturing.</v>

167
00:08:58.151 --> 00:08:58.280
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

168
00:08:58.280 --> 00:09:00.500
<v Speaker 2>well we're talking to</v>

169
00:09:00.540 --> 00:09:03.030
<v Speaker 3>about logistics,</v>
<v Speaker 3>semiconductors and someone.</v>

170
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.893
<v Speaker 3>All of these things make the </v>
<v Speaker 3>manufacturing process cheaper and more </v>

171
00:09:06.301 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 3>efficient,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but not only that,</v>

172
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:08.454
<v Speaker 3>this network effect is what attracts the</v>
<v Speaker 3>best engineers in skilled professionals </v>

173
00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:13.470
<v Speaker 3>to these countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This is a central,</v>

174
00:09:13.471 --> 00:09:16.060
<v Speaker 3>if you want to create a high tech </v>
<v Speaker 3>industry in it</v>

175
00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:16.963
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

176
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:20.203
<v Speaker 1>like good luck trying to convince a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman who lives in San Francisco and </v>

177
00:09:22.661 --> 00:09:27.580
<v Speaker 1>makes a six figure salary to move to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Roserio Argentina to work in a factory.</v>

178
00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.850
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's pretty much impossible.</v>

179
00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wash,</v>

180
00:09:35.031 --> 00:09:37.970
<v Speaker 1>can matt green due to industrialize his </v>
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>

181
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:38.833
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first thing we have to keep in mind </v>

182
00:09:39.501 --> 00:09:42.320
<v Speaker 1>is that silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was not created in a day.</v>

183
00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:43.243
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina has a great advantage over </v>

184
00:09:45.081 --> 00:09:45.914
<v Speaker 1>California.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can make easy money by selling raw </v>

185
00:09:48.321 --> 00:09:49.154
<v Speaker 1>lithium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course there's money can be used by </v>

186
00:09:50.331 --> 00:09:52.220
<v Speaker 1>the government to simply boost their </v>
<v Speaker 1>earnings,</v>

187
00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:53.113
<v Speaker 1>but it is also a good opportunity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>invest in universities that will train </v>

188
00:09:55.701 --> 00:09:59.570
<v Speaker 1>those workers that might start those </v>
<v Speaker 1>small companies that are needed in order</v>

189
00:09:59.571 --> 00:10:01.030
<v Speaker 1>to get the big factories up and yeah,</v>

190
00:10:01.090 --> 00:10:01.923
<v Speaker 2>running</v>

191
00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.820
<v Speaker 1>the government can also co-financed </v>
<v Speaker 1>brand new businesses.</v>

192
00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:11.150
<v Speaker 1>This is actually the formula that helps </v>
<v Speaker 1>Israel become a technological capital as</v>

193
00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.033
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far it seems that Macri is committed </v>

194
00:10:13.691 --> 00:10:14.650
<v Speaker 1>to working this way.</v>

195
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:15.793
<v Speaker 3>We have learned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have understand that in addition to </v>

196
00:10:19.071 --> 00:10:23.420
<v Speaker 3>our talents,</v>
<v Speaker 3>our huge natural resources,</v>

197
00:10:23.421 --> 00:10:24.254
<v Speaker 3>we have to add constancy.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have to add rule of law to be </v>

198
00:10:28.821 --> 00:10:29.654
<v Speaker 3>predictable.</v>

199
00:10:35.430 --> 00:10:36.060
<v Speaker 2>But</v>

200
00:10:36.060 --> 00:10:39.540
<v Speaker 3>wait a minute because there are some </v>
<v Speaker 3>dark clouds on the horizon.</v>

201
00:10:39.570 --> 00:10:40.403
<v Speaker 3>All these opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Argentina has will disappear if my cree </v>

202
00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:47.520
<v Speaker 3>or whoever follows him falls back into </v>
<v Speaker 3>the temptation of destroying the rule of</v>

203
00:10:47.521 --> 00:10:48.354
<v Speaker 3>law and going back to ultra nationalism,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which could scare away foreigners as it </v>

204
00:10:52.111 --> 00:10:53.550
<v Speaker 3>has in many other countries.</v>

205
00:10:53.690 --> 00:10:57.770
<v Speaker 1>And it seems that Cristina Fernandez de </v>
<v Speaker 1>catch now wants to run for office again.</v>

206
00:10:58.480 --> 00:10:59.313
<v Speaker 3>I am not asking you to vote for me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] I'm not asking you to vote </v>

207
00:11:03.751 --> 00:11:08.280
<v Speaker 3>with the people behind me.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I am asking you to vote for yourself.</v>

208
00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:09.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

209
00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:13.350
<v Speaker 1>Say well now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Argentina could restore the</v>

210
00:11:13.351 --> 00:11:14.184
<v Speaker 1>rule of Lauren's to come a wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 1>country thanks to lithium or how are we </v>

211
00:11:16.681 --> 00:11:21.060
<v Speaker 1>going to see a new nationalist backlash </v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's a brand new economic crisis?</v>

212
00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Well you can leave your answer in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comment section below and just before he</v>

<v Speaker 1>we'd love to hear from anyone who has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Benz and thinks that their music could </v>
