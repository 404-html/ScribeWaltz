00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.140
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>

2
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:09.190
<v Speaker 1>slot machines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>poker,</v>

3
00:00:09.191 --> 00:00:10.600
<v Speaker 1>blackjack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of all mine,</v>

4
00:00:10.601 --> 00:00:12.550
<v Speaker 1>so probably interests traveled to </v>
<v Speaker 1>London,</v>

5
00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:13.473
<v Speaker 2>Vegas,</v>

6
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.083
<v Speaker 1>sin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the place that everyone thinks of </v>

7
00:00:19.281 --> 00:00:20.114
<v Speaker 1>when they think of gambling as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's because it's the world's capital </v>

8
00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:24.110
<v Speaker 1>of gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

9
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:25.003
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually it is not because the world's </v>

10
00:00:27.231 --> 00:00:30.530
<v Speaker 1>leading capital of gambling is by no </v>
<v Speaker 1>means Las Vegas.</v>

11
00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:31.423
<v Speaker 1>It's Macau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau is an autonomous city located in </v>

12
00:00:33.921 --> 00:00:36.860
<v Speaker 1>the south of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very close to Hong Kong.</v>

13
00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.700
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's so close to Hong Kong,</v>

14
00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.800
<v Speaker 1>but the fastest way to get to Macau from</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong is by a fast ferry.</v>

15
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.890
<v Speaker 1>It takes about an hour.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau is a very curious city.</v>

16
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.173
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's a small slice of Portugal inside </v>

17
00:00:53.401 --> 00:00:56.670
<v Speaker 1>the very chaotic Asian southwest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

18
00:00:56.671 --> 00:01:00.990
<v Speaker 1>it's place where skyscrapers and bowls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern architecture of very easy to do</v>

19
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:01.863
<v Speaker 2>fine</v>

20
00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:04.373
<v Speaker 1>landscape is dominated by an enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>skyscraper skyscraper with colorful </v>

21
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:13.140
<v Speaker 1>crystals in the sheep of Lotus flowers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This building is the Grand Lisboa.</v>

22
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.000
<v Speaker 1>Above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Macau is something of a messy city.</v>

23
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.000
<v Speaker 1>It's all rather ramshackle and full of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tiny little street</v>

24
00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.343
<v Speaker 1>was the last colonial European city in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia and it remained a colonial city </v>

25
00:01:29.391 --> 00:01:33.830
<v Speaker 1>until very recent times for centuries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was a part of Portugal that was until</v>

26
00:01:33.831 --> 00:01:37.400
<v Speaker 1>the end of 1999 when it was finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>integrated with China.</v>

27
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.150
<v Speaker 1>At this point it was set up in China as </v>
<v Speaker 1>a special administrative region.</v>

28
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>This essentially allows for the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

29
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:47.030
<v Speaker 1>but two systems set up these two cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau and Hong Kong,</v>

30
00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:47.864
<v Speaker 1>even though they are a part of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keep their own legislation with certain </v>

31
00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:51.974
<v Speaker 1>limitations and they also have their own</v>
<v Speaker 1>customs caught currency and political </v>

32
00:01:55.491 --> 00:01:57.110
<v Speaker 1>institutions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In practical terms,</v>

33
00:01:57.111 --> 00:01:59.810
<v Speaker 1>they really work as if they are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different country from China.</v>

34
00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly in Macau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Portuguese is still an official language</v>

35
00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.090
<v Speaker 2>which normally an issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ilene with Zoe and we will give the MCO.</v>

36
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.303
<v Speaker 1>Well really mcconnell could be more </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered a gambling theme part rather </v>

37
00:02:13.531 --> 00:02:14.364
<v Speaker 1>than a city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every year Macau receives over 30 </v>

38
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.313
<v Speaker 1>million tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This makes this tiny piece of land is </v>

39
00:02:21.601 --> 00:02:24.840
<v Speaker 1>one of the most visited places in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

40
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.820
<v Speaker 1>So why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You might be asking.</v>

41
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.683
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's because it's the only place in </v>

42
00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:32.000
<v Speaker 1>the whole of China where gambling is </v>
<v Speaker 1>permitted.</v>

43
00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.843
<v Speaker 2>Thanks this,</v>

44
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.180
<v Speaker 1>since there's integration with China or </v>
<v Speaker 1>up until 2014,</v>

45
00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:42.043
<v Speaker 1>the region has enjoyed one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest periods of economic growth in </v>

46
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.270
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a little over 10 years,</v>

47
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.170
<v Speaker 1>GDP has multiplied by 10 going from </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000,000</v>

48
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.290
<v Speaker 1>to 55 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>

49
00:02:54.291 --> 00:02:55.124
<v Speaker 1>There was a very key moments in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth phase and that was when mccowen </v>

50
00:02:58.161 --> 00:02:58.994
<v Speaker 1>gave the gambling free reign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was at this very moment so that huge </v>

51
00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:03.634
<v Speaker 1>multinational gambling companies moved </v>
<v Speaker 1>in to establish themselves in Macau and </v>

52
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.343
<v Speaker 1>this changed the identity forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's something about the Asian </v>

53
00:03:11.141 --> 00:03:11.974
<v Speaker 1>culture where gaming is acceptable as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>form of entertainment and so that is a </v>

54
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.203
<v Speaker 1>major driver of the success I think that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've seen here and clearly in </v>

55
00:03:19.571 --> 00:03:20.404
<v Speaker 1>Singapore today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The city is known as Chinese last Vegas </v>

56
00:03:22.391 --> 00:03:23.224
<v Speaker 1>for its high concentration of casinos at</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear view is about is something of a </v>

57
00:03:27.161 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>ridiculous name because gambling in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau is a way,</v>

58
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:33.550
<v Speaker 1>way bigger deal than in Las Vegas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the cows.</v>

59
00:03:33.551 --> 00:03:37.600
<v Speaker 1>Forty plus casinos in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over $29,000,000,000</v>

60
00:03:37.601 --> 00:03:40.840
<v Speaker 1>was invoiced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for some perspective is five times</v>

61
00:03:40.841 --> 00:03:41.420
<v Speaker 1>that of last year,</v>

62
00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:42.253
<v Speaker 2>Vegas</v>

63
00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:44.643
<v Speaker 1>in 2013,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it reached the astonishing amount of </v>

64
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.883
<v Speaker 1>$45,000,000,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for a comparison is almost the </v>

65
00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:51.244
<v Speaker 1>same as the entire amounts of money that</v>
<v Speaker 1>franz receives from its entire tourism </v>

66
00:03:55.511 --> 00:03:56.344
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It really is pretty amazing gambling </v>

67
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:00.190
<v Speaker 1>lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luxury shops,</v>

68
00:04:00.191 --> 00:04:02.980
<v Speaker 1>sends well still more lights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Macau's,</v>

69
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:03.820
<v Speaker 1>new identity.</v>

70
00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.910
<v Speaker 2>My cows casinos</v>

71
00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.223
<v Speaker 1>now on every time you think of gambling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do not think of a Monte Carlo or Las </v>

72
00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.393
<v Speaker 1>Vegas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do think of Macau and there is </v>

73
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:19.340
<v Speaker 1>absolutely no slowing down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Three new mega casinos.</v>

74
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:22.620
<v Speaker 1>The result of multimillion dollar </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments that have opened in the last</v>

75
00:04:22.621 --> 00:04:27.621
<v Speaker 1>12 months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

76
00:04:28.041 --> 00:04:31.790
<v Speaker 1>at the end of 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these studio city development opens.</v>

77
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 1>This is a huge hotel casino complex with</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Hollywood atmosphere.</v>

78
00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.853
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's opening saw the production of a </v>

79
00:04:38.571 --> 00:04:39.404
<v Speaker 1>short 15 minute film which had a </v>
<v Speaker 1>production budget of $70 million </v>

80
00:04:42.771 --> 00:04:44.510
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a record by the way.</v>

81
00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:45.373
<v Speaker 1>The film was directed by Martin Scorsese</v>
<v Speaker 1>and had lead roles played by Robert De </v>

82
00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:50.840
<v Speaker 1>Niro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Leonardo Dicaprio,</v>

83
00:04:50.841 --> 00:04:51.674
<v Speaker 1>and Brad Pitt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which leaves us wondering what possible </v>

84
00:04:53.361 --> 00:04:54.730
<v Speaker 1>hotel opening good editorial.</v>

85
00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:58.313
<v Speaker 2>This part,</v>

86
00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:07.370
<v Speaker 1>Lee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in August 2016,</v>

87
00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:12.230
<v Speaker 1>the wind palace opened its doors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a luxurious hotel with 1,700</v>

88
00:05:12.231 --> 00:05:13.064
<v Speaker 1>Greens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which cost about four point 2 billion </v>

89
00:05:14.721 --> 00:05:19.721
<v Speaker 1>USD.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just hotel to open.</v>

90
00:05:22.231 --> 00:05:24.150
<v Speaker 1>At the time of writing was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Parisians.</v>

91
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:27.480
<v Speaker 1>This is a masterpiece created bind for </v>
<v Speaker 1>last Vegas Sands Company,</v>

92
00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:29.960
<v Speaker 1>which is owned by wealthy invest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Sheldon Adelson.</v>

93
00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:32.490
<v Speaker 2>This</v>

94
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.970
<v Speaker 1>hotel is essentially a city in itself </v>
<v Speaker 1>with free thousand rooms,</v>

95
00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:38.940
<v Speaker 1>a waterpark and even its own half scare </v>
<v Speaker 1>life for</v>

96
00:05:39.230 --> 00:05:40.063
<v Speaker 2>tower.</v>

97
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The openings do continue.</v>

98
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:47.273
<v Speaker 1>The next opening is going to be the 13,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is billed as the most expensive </v>

99
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:51.773
<v Speaker 1>hotel in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some of the rooms in this hotel are </v>

100
00:05:53.521 --> 00:05:54.354
<v Speaker 1>going to cost between 50 and a hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>thousand dollars night and know that is </v>

101
00:05:58.701 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>not a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the plus side,</v>

102
00:06:00.621 --> 00:06:01.454
<v Speaker 1>guests are going to have the use of 30 </v>
<v Speaker 1>rolls royces burst at the cost of 50 to </v>

103
00:06:04.621 --> 00:06:05.720
<v Speaker 1>$100,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>a night.</v>

104
00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.410
<v Speaker 1>They should probably be be giving you a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rolls Royce along with these new hotels.</v>

105
00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:10.263
<v Speaker 1>Casinos,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the most legendary in Macau </v>

106
00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.080
<v Speaker 1>currently are the Galaxy Grand Lisboa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the city of dreams,</v>

107
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:16.550
<v Speaker 1>the Venetian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mgm,</v>

108
00:06:16.551 --> 00:06:19.970
<v Speaker 1>as well as many more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Mcconnell keeps this up,</v>

109
00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.200
<v Speaker 1>the Strip in Las Vegas is soon going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>look like the work of an amateur</v>

110
00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.530
<v Speaker 3>profit sharing in the cow more than </v>
<v Speaker 3>yeah,</v>

111
00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:33.020
<v Speaker 1>80 percent of governmental income comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>from these casinos ends.</v>

112
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:37.410
<v Speaker 1>The money is so abundant that every year</v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau has a significant budget.</v>

113
00:06:37.411 --> 00:06:40.890
<v Speaker 1>Surplus Mcconnell is completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>unfamiliar with the idea of a deficit,</v>

114
00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:42.720
<v Speaker 1>and as you can probably imagine from </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

115
00:06:42.721 --> 00:06:43.554
<v Speaker 1>taxes are rather low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering what </v>

116
00:06:45.961 --> 00:06:49.230
<v Speaker 1>exactly does the government do with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge surplus every year?</v>

117
00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:50.123
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of it is invested in </v>

118
00:06:51.091 --> 00:06:54.960
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but an entire third of it is wait for it</v>

119
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:58.320
<v Speaker 1>paid to Macau Macau's citizens as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dividend.</v>

120
00:06:58.440 --> 00:06:59.251
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Again,</v>

121
00:06:59.251 --> 00:07:02.070
<v Speaker 1>we are not making a mistake here since </v>
<v Speaker 1>2008,</v>

122
00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:02.963
<v Speaker 1>all of the city's inhabitants have </v>
<v Speaker 1>received a portion of the income from </v>

123
00:07:06.391 --> 00:07:07.890
<v Speaker 1>the casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

124
00:07:07.891 --> 00:07:08.724
<v Speaker 1>in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dividend was a thousand dollars per </v>

125
00:07:11.401 --> 00:07:13.740
<v Speaker 1>citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that for a family of four,</v>

126
00:07:13.741 --> 00:07:16.830
<v Speaker 1>they are getting a check for $4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>every single year,</v>

127
00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:17.723
<v Speaker 1>which isn't exactly bad and this is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only benefit that the citizens get </v>

128
00:07:21.541 --> 00:07:22.374
<v Speaker 1>from the casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Every one in four jobs in Macau is in </v>

129
00:07:24.391 --> 00:07:26.490
<v Speaker 1>the casino industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so low taxes,</v>

130
00:07:26.491 --> 00:07:29.760
<v Speaker 1>high employment rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and dividends paid out from the casinos.</v>

131
00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:32.870
<v Speaker 1>It all seems like a pretty sweet deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

132
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.220
<v Speaker 1>not everything is sunshine and rainbows </v>
<v Speaker 1>and yeah,</v>

133
00:07:35.300 --> 00:07:39.020
<v Speaker 3>lollipops,</v>
<v Speaker 3>crises in Macau,</v>

134
00:07:40.290 --> 00:07:41.123
<v Speaker 3>most tourists,</v>

135
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.993
<v Speaker 1>Macau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>around two thirds coming from </v>

136
00:07:42.901 --> 00:07:43.734
<v Speaker 1>continental China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the economy over the </v>

137
00:07:45.751 --> 00:07:49.290
<v Speaker 1>region is highly dependent on China's,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that wasn't enough,</v>

138
00:07:49.291 --> 00:07:50.124
<v Speaker 1>she shipping the president of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>started a war against public work at </v>

139
00:07:53.221 --> 00:07:56.010
<v Speaker 1>corruption in 2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After that time,</v>

140
00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:58.560
<v Speaker 1>the economy of Macau collapsed.</v>

141
00:07:58.730 --> 00:08:02.330
<v Speaker 3>Chinese President Xi Jinping has been </v>
<v Speaker 3>cleaning house on the mainland,</v>

142
00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:03.193
<v Speaker 3>including cracking down on those.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trying to take money out of the country </v>

143
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:08.570
<v Speaker 3>illegally and that's making some high </v>
<v Speaker 3>rollers.</v>

144
00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:11.570
<v Speaker 3>Very wary about spending big in Macau</v>

145
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:12.513
<v Speaker 1>in a single year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The gambling income over the city fell </v>

146
00:08:14.711 --> 00:08:15.544
<v Speaker 1>by 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This led to the economy of Macau losing </v>

147
00:08:17.831 --> 00:08:21.580
<v Speaker 1>more than 20 percent of its GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The corrupts public workers in China had</v>

148
00:08:21.581 --> 00:08:23.890
<v Speaker 1>gotten use to the idea of going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Macau.</v>

149
00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.650
<v Speaker 1>They could easily spend their money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do some gambling,</v>

150
00:08:26.651 --> 00:08:29.550
<v Speaker 1>attended red carpet like events and </v>
<v Speaker 1>while they're there,</v>

151
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:30.850
<v Speaker 1>probably do some laundry.</v>

152
00:08:30.910 --> 00:08:31.743
<v Speaker 3>Have the money for it generally,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and I decided there will be no </v>

153
00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:35.920
<v Speaker 3>investigation.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now if you'll excuse me,</v>

154
00:08:35.921 --> 00:08:36.540
<v Speaker 3>I'll go away</v>

155
00:08:36.540 --> 00:08:37.373
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not as if the whole industry </v>

156
00:08:38.491 --> 00:08:41.970
<v Speaker 1>depends on them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as in the Chinese economic slow down</v>

157
00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:42.873
<v Speaker 1>and to the new controls established by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government as many of these </v>

158
00:08:45.481 --> 00:08:48.750
<v Speaker 1>vip so you used to go to Macau,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have simply stopped doing so.</v>

159
00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:51.240
<v Speaker 1>Now this is going to continue for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little while at least,</v>

160
00:08:51.241 --> 00:08:52.074
<v Speaker 1>and it's causing problems from the cow </v>
<v Speaker 1>because half of their economy relies on </v>

161
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.070
<v Speaker 1>thanks to numerous investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good state of public finance,</v>

162
00:08:59.071 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>and is the advantage of being such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>important tourist cluster.</v>

163
00:09:01.980 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 1>These social and economic effects have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been limited,</v>

164
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 1>so the government's keeps a comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>surplus.</v>

165
00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:07.783
<v Speaker 1>The unemployment rate is one point eight</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and his family incomes have not </v>

166
00:09:10.561 --> 00:09:13.290
<v Speaker 1>suffered violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing is absolutely true.</v>

167
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.810
<v Speaker 1>As Xi Jinping said on his last visit to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the city,</v>

168
00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:19.830
<v Speaker 1>it is time for diversification and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments has already presented a plan</v>

169
00:09:19.831 --> 00:09:20.240
<v Speaker 1>to tackle</v>

170
00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.073
<v Speaker 2>Columbus</v>

171
00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.920
<v Speaker 1>based on family tourism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>

172
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.080
<v Speaker 1>tourism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>finance,</v>

173
00:09:28.081 --> 00:09:30.630
<v Speaker 1>and the technological industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the next few years,</v>

174
00:09:30.690 --> 00:09:33.540
<v Speaker 1>the economy has already started to </v>
<v Speaker 1>bounce back.</v>

175
00:09:33.570 --> 00:09:35.850
<v Speaker 1>If the government's plans do become a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reality,</v>

176
00:09:35.890 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>Macau might become some sort of 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century Monaco in the next few years.</v>

177
00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:45.000
<v Speaker 1>The city's mistake was to put all of its</v>
<v Speaker 1>eggs in one basket and not diversifying.</v>

178
00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:48.300
<v Speaker 1>They didn't make it easy for companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>to form and they didn't make it easy for</v>

179
00:09:48.301 --> 00:09:49.134
<v Speaker 1>outside investors to come in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something that also happened in </v>

180
00:09:51.511 --> 00:09:52.344
<v Speaker 1>Atlantic city with serious consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to be </v>

181
00:09:54.841 --> 00:09:57.960
<v Speaker 1>looking at in a future video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what do you think about Macau?</v>

187

<v Speaker 4>shift bosses.</v>

188
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:22.560
<v Speaker 4>I'm watching the casino manager and the </v>
