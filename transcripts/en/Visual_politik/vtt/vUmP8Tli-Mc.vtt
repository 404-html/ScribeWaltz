<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.300
<v Speaker 2>I'm going to ask you a question and </v>
<v Speaker 2>don't google it.</v>

3
00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.390
<v Speaker 2>What's the biggest agricultural power in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe?</v>

4
00:00:13.391 --> 00:00:17.860
<v Speaker 2>Who is the biggest food export in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire European Union?</v>

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:18.793
<v Speaker 2>How many of you might think Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Italy or even France after all these </v>

6
00:00:22.271 --> 00:00:23.104
<v Speaker 2>countries have good weather and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands upon thousands of hectares of </v>

7
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:27.633
<v Speaker 2>arable land?</v>

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.360
<v Speaker 2>None of these countries though comes </v>
<v Speaker 2>close to the Netherlands,</v>

9
00:00:35.361 --> 00:00:36.194
<v Speaker 2>also known as Holland.</v>
<v Speaker 2>To give you a better idea of the </v>

10
00:00:38.151 --> 00:00:41.990
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands is almost the largest food </v>
<v Speaker 2>exporter in the world.</v>

11
00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.853
<v Speaker 2>Second only to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is kind of a surprise because </v>

12
00:00:45.801 --> 00:00:48.140
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about a country here that </v>
<v Speaker 2>is so small.</v>

13
00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.500
<v Speaker 2>They had to build a dams to reclaim </v>
<v Speaker 2>lambs from the seed.</v>

14
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:52.603
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's one of the most densely populated </v>

15
00:00:54.171 --> 00:00:55.004
<v Speaker 2>countries in the world to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We need to add the fact that they are </v>

16
00:00:57.441 --> 00:01:00.290
<v Speaker 2>one of the richest ans most modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries on the planets.</v>

17
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.620
<v Speaker 2>The first stock markets was created in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Amsterdam and man's.</v>

18
00:01:03.621 --> 00:01:06.050
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure all of you know Dutch companies</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Shell,</v>

19
00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.150
<v Speaker 2>Philips or the bank.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ing.</v>

20
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Normally when a country has many </v>
<v Speaker 2>industrial or service companies,</v>

21
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.690
<v Speaker 2>agriculture is placed on the back </v>
<v Speaker 2>burner.</v>

22
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.520
<v Speaker 2>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

23
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.383
<v Speaker 2>why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is the Netherlands such a big food </v>

24
00:01:23.941 --> 00:01:24.810
<v Speaker 2>producer?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

25
00:01:24.811 --> 00:01:26.790
<v Speaker 2>imagine that we have a piece of land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

26
00:01:26.791 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 2>we'll say in Spain that measures one </v>
<v Speaker 2>hector,</v>

27
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.160
<v Speaker 2>if you use it to plant potatoes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can earn between 7,000</v>

28
00:01:32.161 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 2>and 8,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>euros per hector.</v>

29
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.593
<v Speaker 2>Imagine instead the amount of money that</v>
<v Speaker 2>we could earn if we use that area to </v>

30
00:01:37.531 --> 00:01:40.330
<v Speaker 2>build a factory or an office building.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When you do that kind of math,</v>

31
00:01:40.331 --> 00:01:41.164
<v Speaker 2>that quickly becomes clear.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why countries move away from </v>

32
00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:43.800
<v Speaker 2>agriculture?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

33
00:01:43.801 --> 00:01:44.634
<v Speaker 2>despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland is the world leader of potato </v>

34
00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.110
<v Speaker 2>exports about France above Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>above even the US.</v>

35
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.820
<v Speaker 2>And now I can probably guess what </v>
<v Speaker 2>something you're thinking agriculture in</v>

36
00:01:58.821 --> 00:02:00.920
<v Speaker 2>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean Brussels has got to be giving out</v>

37
00:02:00.921 --> 00:02:02.330
<v Speaker 2>grants somewhere,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

38
00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.313
<v Speaker 2>Agriculture is indeed one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>protected sectors with the most aid in </v>

39
00:02:06.291 --> 00:02:08.330
<v Speaker 2>the entire European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

40
00:02:08.331 --> 00:02:11.300
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands isn't the country that </v>
<v Speaker 2>receives the most money.</v>

41
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.210
<v Speaker 2>Of course they receive aid like any </v>
<v Speaker 2>other member country,</v>

42
00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.810
<v Speaker 2>but they don't even get a third of what </v>
<v Speaker 2>grease gets.</v>

43
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.540
<v Speaker 2>And if we compare it with larger </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like France,</v>

44
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:21.403
<v Speaker 2>the difference in aid is huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how is it possible that with so </v>

45
00:02:25.221 --> 00:02:26.054
<v Speaker 2>nessel lambs and so little help,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Holland has become the garden of the </v>

46
00:02:30.021 --> 00:02:35.021
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

47
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:35.984
<v Speaker 2>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is simply explained in one </v>

48
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.730
<v Speaker 2>word,</v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

49
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:41.893
<v Speaker 2>In a farm in the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can find a tractors that drive </v>

50
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:44.714
<v Speaker 2>themselves as drones that monitor crops </v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course resource optimization at </v>

51
00:02:48.351 --> 00:02:49.700
<v Speaker 2>the highest level.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

52
00:02:49.701 --> 00:02:50.534
<v Speaker 2>there's still a question here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why does hollins have more modern </v>

53
00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:55.310
<v Speaker 2>agriculture than for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain?</v>

54
00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.440
<v Speaker 2>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what is the Netherlands done that can be</v>

55
00:02:57.441 --> 00:02:58.274
<v Speaker 2>imitators in other countries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well today we're going to answer these </v>

56
00:03:00.761 --> 00:03:02.170
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>

57
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.820
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at their history</v>

58
00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.423
<v Speaker 2>from the field to the university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the 1970s Hollands had one of the </v>

59
00:03:11.401 --> 00:03:13.650
<v Speaker 2>most prosperous economies in all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Europe.</v>

60
00:03:13.651 --> 00:03:17.760
<v Speaker 2>Companies such as Phillips and Abis were</v>
<v Speaker 2>conquering the international markets.</v>

61
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.270
<v Speaker 2>And all of this was great news for the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Netherlands.</v>

62
00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 2>But as we always say on a visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic,</v>

63
00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.710
<v Speaker 2>not everything was a field of racist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine being 20 years old and living in</v>

64
00:03:28.711 --> 00:03:31.740
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands back then.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Where would you have liked to work in an</v>

65
00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:32.574
<v Speaker 2>international company like Phillips with</v>
<v Speaker 2>high salaries and good conditions on </v>

66
00:03:36.151 --> 00:03:37.710
<v Speaker 2>your father's farm?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

67
00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:39.600
<v Speaker 2>exactly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch agriculture.</v>

68
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.583
<v Speaker 2>It was on the verge of disappearing and </v>
<v Speaker 2>we also have to add something very </v>

69
00:03:43.471 --> 00:03:45.270
<v Speaker 2>important to this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we said before,</v>

70
00:03:45.271 --> 00:03:49.110
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands is very small and </v>
<v Speaker 2>there's hardly any space for large font.</v>

71
00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.251
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

72
00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:55.084
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of lands in the United </v>
<v Speaker 2>States and that means that farmers can </v>

73
00:03:57.851 --> 00:03:59.830
<v Speaker 2>group and creates a large farm.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

74
00:03:59.831 --> 00:04:02.740
<v Speaker 2>today and lots of American farms </v>
<v Speaker 2>belonged to large corporations.</v>

75
00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.550
<v Speaker 2>This means that they can scale </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments and by for example,</v>

76
00:04:06.551 --> 00:04:09.730
<v Speaker 2>planes to fumigate huge areas of lambs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

77
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:10.564
<v Speaker 2>in the case of the Netherlands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farms are small with an average size of </v>

78
00:04:12.911 --> 00:04:17.230
<v Speaker 2>around seven hacks as making large </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments really very complicated.</v>

79
00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:18.123
<v Speaker 2>To make matters worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the seventies Dutch salaries were </v>

80
00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.230
<v Speaker 2>already much higher than in other </v>
<v Speaker 2>European countries.</v>

81
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.780
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unlike the farmers in southern Italy,</v>

82
00:04:25.781 --> 00:04:26.614
<v Speaker 2>the Dutch couldn't compete with low </v>
<v Speaker 2>prices and you might be wondering now </v>

83
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.360
<v Speaker 2>why did they need agricor?</v>

84
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.273
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

85
00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.703
<v Speaker 2>After rule in those years there was </v>
<v Speaker 2>already a certain degree of </v>

86
00:04:38.871 --> 00:04:41.570
<v Speaker 2>international trade.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then Netherlands goods imports,</v>

87
00:04:41.571 --> 00:04:44.630
<v Speaker 2>food while they manufacturer televisions</v>
<v Speaker 2>or bad things,</v>

88
00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:45.590
<v Speaker 2>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

89
00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.453
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that that is rice and from a purely </v>

90
00:04:47.901 --> 00:04:48.734
<v Speaker 2>economic point of view,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could have easily let go of their </v>

91
00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:52.430
<v Speaker 2>primary sex there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

92
00:04:52.431 --> 00:04:53.264
<v Speaker 2>the reality is in life,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything is just the economy and </v>

93
00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.703
<v Speaker 2>it's in hollins forming associations </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a lot of power more so than in </v>

94
00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:01.520
<v Speaker 2>pretty much every other country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

95
00:05:01.521 --> 00:05:02.354
<v Speaker 2>in many other countries they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>something called the social dialogue </v>

96
00:05:05.031 --> 00:05:05.864
<v Speaker 2>table,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is an organization where the </v>

97
00:05:06.891 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>employers and unions,</v>

98
00:05:08.661 --> 00:05:09.494
<v Speaker 2>meat on the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I have something similar at along with </v>

99
00:05:11.241 --> 00:05:12.074
<v Speaker 2>employers and unions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers and ranchers associations are </v>

100
00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:14.984
<v Speaker 2>also welcome and in the 1970s Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers and ranchers weren't willing to </v>

101
00:05:22.311 --> 00:05:23.144
<v Speaker 2>change jobs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So consider yourself put in this </v>

102
00:05:24.801 --> 00:05:26.150
<v Speaker 2>situation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hollins hat,</v>

103
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:28.910
<v Speaker 2>to maintain its primary sector at all </v>
<v Speaker 2>costs.</v>

104
00:05:28.911 --> 00:05:29.744
<v Speaker 2>But at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of the odds were stacked against </v>

105
00:05:31.851 --> 00:05:32.660
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At this point,</v>

106
00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.880
<v Speaker 2>I know you must be thinking they did </v>
<v Speaker 2>grants.</v>

107
00:05:34.881 --> 00:05:35.714
<v Speaker 2>The solution would be to simply give </v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies to farmers so they'd stop </v>

108
00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:39.740
<v Speaker 2>protesting.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

109
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:45.123
<v Speaker 2>This is been exactly need the first or </v>
<v Speaker 2>the last time that such policies have </v>

110
00:05:47.251 --> 00:05:48.750
<v Speaker 2>been applied,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Dutch government,</v>

111
00:05:48.751 --> 00:05:49.584
<v Speaker 2>they actually had other plans now that </v>
<v Speaker 2>they had to maintain their primary </v>

112
00:05:52.231 --> 00:05:54.840
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to do it well and since they</v>

113
00:05:54.841 --> 00:05:55.674
<v Speaker 2>couldn't reduce salaries or group farms,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was only one solution left and </v>

114
00:05:59.811 --> 00:06:00.644
<v Speaker 2>that was to improve productivity.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is getting the farmers to produce </v>

115
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.600
<v Speaker 2>more and better food.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

116
00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:06.523
<v Speaker 2>how did they do as well?</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's exactly what we're going to look </v>

117
00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:08.630
<v Speaker 2>into right now.</v>

118
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:14.033
<v Speaker 2>The University of Bugging Meghan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you've probably heard this sentiment is </v>

119
00:06:16.801 --> 00:06:17.634
<v Speaker 2>a thousand times silicon valley wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 2>be what it is today if it weren't for </v>

120
00:06:21.391 --> 00:06:24.960
<v Speaker 2>Stanford University.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's the Maca on research for everything</v>

121
00:06:24.961 --> 00:06:28.170
<v Speaker 2>that has to do with electronics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>telecommunications,</v>

122
00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:29.123
<v Speaker 2>but they don't only do research.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also train the best computer </v>

123
00:06:31.771 --> 00:06:32.604
<v Speaker 2>scientists in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And when those computer scientists and </v>

124
00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:35.303
<v Speaker 2>even the university,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they go directly to big companies like </v>

125
00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:39.030
<v Speaker 2>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 2>apple,</v>

126
00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:40.410
<v Speaker 2>and Tesla.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

127
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.273
<v Speaker 2>there's far as agriculture is concerned.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The macro of innovation isn't actually </v>

128
00:06:43.771 --> 00:06:44.604
<v Speaker 2>in the u s but it's in the Netherlands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the University of </v>

129
00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:54.470
<v Speaker 2>bargaining and also known as food </v>
<v Speaker 2>valley.</v>

130
00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:56.900
<v Speaker 2>Many of you might not have heard about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this university.</v>

131
00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:59.040
<v Speaker 2>That's because the only work in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world of ag.</v>

132
00:06:59.060 --> 00:06:59.310
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

133
00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:00.143
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

134
00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:04.930
<v Speaker 2>That don't have degrees in law or art </v>
<v Speaker 2>history.</v>

135
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:09.220
<v Speaker 2>Volga nivens motto is to improve food </v>
<v Speaker 2>quality for the entire world.</v>

136
00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:10.113
<v Speaker 2>So you might be wondering right now why </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's so special about this university </v>

137
00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:13.593
<v Speaker 2>or the first difference is money.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Netherlands knew that they needed </v>

138
00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:18.790
<v Speaker 2>technology to improve their farming so </v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

139
00:07:18.791 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 2>what did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

140
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:20.673
<v Speaker 2>they showered there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Scientists with money in just two </v>

141
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.290
<v Speaker 2>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the university's research budget doubled</v>

142
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.153
<v Speaker 2>that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hold on just a moment because money is </v>

143
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:32.510
<v Speaker 2>not the only important thing here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is the most important thing.</v>

144
00:07:32.511 --> 00:07:35.970
<v Speaker 2>It wasn't how much but where the money </v>
<v Speaker 2>was coming,</v>

145
00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.393
<v Speaker 1>see</v>

146
00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.740
<v Speaker 2>in many European countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then most of Latin American,</v>

147
00:07:43.741 --> 00:07:47.570
<v Speaker 2>there's a very clear line that separates</v>
<v Speaker 2>public and private universities.</v>

148
00:07:47.690 --> 00:07:50.420
<v Speaker 2>Public universities are funded from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

149
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they can have some sort of collaboration</v>

150
00:07:52.941 --> 00:07:53.774
<v Speaker 2>with private companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that's not their main source of </v>

151
00:07:55.371 --> 00:07:57.620
<v Speaker 2>funding.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Long in Nixon's case is different.</v>

152
00:07:57.740 --> 00:07:59.780
<v Speaker 2>50% of their money comes from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government,</v>

153
00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:04.840
<v Speaker 2>25% from the university's own income and</v>
<v Speaker 2>to the last 25% from private companies,</v>

154
00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:06.680
<v Speaker 2>and I can probably guess what you're </v>
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>

155
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:07.514
<v Speaker 2>Private company is funding a university.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does this mean that the university is </v>

156
00:08:10.701 --> 00:08:11.720
<v Speaker 2>private now?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

157
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.900
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it does bring a great advantage.</v>

158
00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:17.720
<v Speaker 2>It allows the university to be connected</v>
<v Speaker 2>with the rest of society.</v>

159
00:08:20.780 --> 00:08:22.790
<v Speaker 3>When we went well</v>

160
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.470
<v Speaker 2>preparing this video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a phone call with a farmer called</v>

161
00:08:26.471 --> 00:08:28.870
<v Speaker 2>sees a bravo and Spain more </v>
<v Speaker 2>specifically,</v>

162
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:29.883
<v Speaker 2>he's from the Canary Islands and we </v>
<v Speaker 2>asked you about how agricultural </v>

163
00:08:32.081 --> 00:08:33.670
<v Speaker 2>modernization works.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

164
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:36.940
<v Speaker 2>you might not know this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but livestock is actually very important</v>

165
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.070
<v Speaker 2>in the Canary Islands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially goats.</v>

166
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 2>They have a specific type of good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're called the palm,</v>

167
00:08:41.791 --> 00:08:43.930
<v Speaker 2>the goats,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is unique from any other breed.</v>

168
00:08:43.931 --> 00:08:44.764
<v Speaker 2>In the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are actually several institutes </v>

169
00:08:46.661 --> 00:08:50.230
<v Speaker 2>and foundations dedicated to studying </v>
<v Speaker 2>this specific type of goat.</v>

170
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:52.030
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as Caesar explained,</v>

171
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:54.760
<v Speaker 2>practically none of the studies are </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually useful to,</v>

172
00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:00.551
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>

173
00:09:00.551 --> 00:09:01.384
<v Speaker 2>If you have a goat farm,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what kind of research do you really </v>

174
00:09:03.461 --> 00:09:04.690
<v Speaker 2>need?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a foreigner?</v>

175
00:09:04.691 --> 00:09:07.720
<v Speaker 2>You want to know how to produce more and</v>
<v Speaker 2>better milk,</v>

176
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:09.610
<v Speaker 2>so these on how to better feed the </v>
<v Speaker 2>animals,</v>

177
00:09:09.611 --> 00:09:13.000
<v Speaker 2>dietary supplements or even genetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>engineering are useful.</v>

178
00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you go to the ICAA website,</v>

179
00:09:15.011 --> 00:09:15.844
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is the Canary Institute use of </v>

180
00:09:17.231 --> 00:09:20.650
<v Speaker 2>Agricultural Research,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you won't find anything like that.</v>

181
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.633
<v Speaker 2>There are tons of academic articles that</v>
<v Speaker 2>explain the breed origin of the palm </v>

182
00:09:24.241 --> 00:09:25.074
<v Speaker 2>egos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>whether it's related to other guys in </v>

183
00:09:26.051 --> 00:09:29.860
<v Speaker 2>Morocco or Tanzania or if they existed </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the middle ages,</v>

184
00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.490
<v Speaker 2>but price kill usage,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that kind of zeroes.</v>

185
00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:37.173
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the times higher education </v>

186
00:09:38.291 --> 00:09:42.760
<v Speaker 2>ranking Vargon Nigga and studies are the</v>
<v Speaker 2>most cited in their fields,</v>

187
00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.653
<v Speaker 2>but that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet you can't guess what the </v>

188
00:09:45.221 --> 00:09:48.340
<v Speaker 2>university's official languages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>given that it's in Hollands,</v>

189
00:09:48.341 --> 00:09:50.890
<v Speaker 2>you'd probably be thinking they would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>speaking Dutch,</v>

190
00:09:50.950 --> 00:09:51.970
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

191
00:09:51.971 --> 00:09:52.840
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

192
00:09:52.870 --> 00:09:53.703
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about the capital of </v>
<v Speaker 2>agricultural research here and because </v>

193
00:09:57.131 --> 00:09:57.964
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 40% of the students and </v>

194
00:09:59.051 --> 00:10:00.580
<v Speaker 2>research stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a foreign,</v>

195
00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.940
<v Speaker 2>no matter where you're from,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you have a talent in agriculture,</v>

196
00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:06.070
<v Speaker 2>you can get to a place at this </v>
<v Speaker 2>university</v>

197
00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.960
<v Speaker 2>record numbers of foreign students at </v>
<v Speaker 2>Dutch universities of technology because</v>

198
00:10:12.961 --> 00:10:13.794
<v Speaker 2>of this international makeup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The official language of the university </v>

199
00:10:15.721 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 2>is English.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That explains why it bargaining and is,</v>

200
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:21.840
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a pioneer in led lamps for greenhouses,</v>

201
00:10:21.900 --> 00:10:22.733
<v Speaker 2>which allows for the creation of </v>
<v Speaker 2>precisely controlled artificial </v>

202
00:10:24.931 --> 00:10:26.760
<v Speaker 2>microclimates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to this,</v>

203
00:10:26.761 --> 00:10:29.200
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands is one of the leaders in</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomato grief.</v>

204
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:32.370
<v Speaker 2>Even though in natural conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tomatoes would never grow in such a cold</v>

205
00:10:32.371 --> 00:10:33.204
<v Speaker 2>country and there's more here in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>country like the u s farmers need about </v>

206
00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:40.290
<v Speaker 2>126 liters of water to grow one kilogram</v>
<v Speaker 2>of tomatoes.</v>

207
00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:42.720
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to this university's research,</v>

208
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:46.410
<v Speaker 2>now one can produce the same amounts </v>
<v Speaker 2>with just eight liters of water.</v>

209
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:51.360
<v Speaker 2>This is an incredible amounts of saving </v>
<v Speaker 2>in both economic and ecological terms.</v>

210
00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.060
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a minute here because </v>
<v Speaker 2>research is good,</v>

211
00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:57.930
<v Speaker 2>but it isn't really worth anything if it</v>
<v Speaker 2>stays within the university.</v>

212
00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:00.060
<v Speaker 2>And in that regard,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Netherlands is again,</v>

213
00:11:00.061 --> 00:11:00.894
<v Speaker 2>a great example of how things are being </v>
<v Speaker 2>done right from the university to the </v>

214
00:11:09.841 --> 00:11:12.130
<v Speaker 2>field.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get back to Spain for a moment.</v>

215
00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:12.973
<v Speaker 2>Imagine that we have a tomato garden and</v>
<v Speaker 2>we want to invest in this hydroponic </v>

216
00:11:16.051 --> 00:11:18.270
<v Speaker 2>technology that will allow us to save </v>
<v Speaker 2>water,</v>

217
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:19.193
<v Speaker 2>the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or more precisely the common </v>

218
00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:21.443
<v Speaker 2>agricultural policy provides all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 2>of grants so that farmers can modernize </v>

219
00:11:25.231 --> 00:11:26.064
<v Speaker 2>their fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So we'll go to the agricultural </v>

220
00:11:27.661 --> 00:11:30.600
<v Speaker 2>extension agency where all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>grants and managed,</v>

221
00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:31.493
<v Speaker 2>so the farmers getting their money there</v>
<v Speaker 2>and then they will make sure that they </v>

222
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:35.910
<v Speaker 2>spend it on improving production </v>
<v Speaker 2>techniques.</v>

223
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.310
<v Speaker 2>So far so good.</v>

224
00:11:41.900 --> 00:11:44.390
<v Speaker 2>But how to farm know which machines to </v>
<v Speaker 2>purchase.</v>

225
00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.300
<v Speaker 2>One would think that the farmer would </v>
<v Speaker 2>know better than anyone what their lands</v>

226
00:11:47.301 --> 00:11:48.134
<v Speaker 2>would need.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is that the agricultural </v>

227
00:11:49.401 --> 00:11:52.370
<v Speaker 2>wells evolves as quickly as Internet </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

228
00:11:52.520 --> 00:11:55.990
<v Speaker 2>And if nobody advises the farmer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they'll have to find the information out</v>

229
00:11:55.991 --> 00:11:57.130
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

230
00:11:57.160 --> 00:11:57.993
<v Speaker 2>that's the situation in which almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>every Spanish farmer has found </v>

231
00:12:00.581 --> 00:12:01.414
<v Speaker 2>themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a huge gap between the </v>

232
00:12:02.711 --> 00:12:03.544
<v Speaker 2>university and the fields.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The dage case though is entirely </v>

233
00:12:06.341 --> 00:12:07.960
<v Speaker 2>different.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the Netherlands,</v>

234
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.110
<v Speaker 2>they have these so called agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>council officers.</v>

235
00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:14.050
<v Speaker 2>That means that there's someone there </v>
<v Speaker 2>who will explain to the farmer what type</v>

236
00:12:14.051 --> 00:12:14.884
<v Speaker 2>of machine they need to buy and what </v>
<v Speaker 2>technologies are best suited for that </v>

237
00:12:18.371 --> 00:12:19.204
<v Speaker 2>type of crime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

238
00:12:23.100 --> 00:12:24.720
<v Speaker 2>and what's the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

239
00:12:24.721 --> 00:12:28.590
<v Speaker 2>Dutch fields look nothing like those in </v>
<v Speaker 2>any other country.</v>

240
00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:32.070
<v Speaker 2>What most of European countries consume </v>
<v Speaker 2>tons of antibiotics for their animals.</v>

241
00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.993
<v Speaker 2>The Netherlands farmers are already </v>
<v Speaker 2>using the most advanced veterinarian </v>

242
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:39.240
<v Speaker 2>techniques in such a way that they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>prevent diseases instead of curing them.</v>

243
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:42.660
<v Speaker 2>The same happens with plants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pesticides in this country.</v>

244
00:12:42.690 --> 00:12:45.150
<v Speaker 2>They notice that if they use drones to </v>
<v Speaker 2>monitor the crops,</v>

245
00:12:45.151 --> 00:12:45.984
<v Speaker 2>they can control each and every one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the vegetables and prevent them from </v>

246
00:12:49.021 --> 00:12:49.854
<v Speaker 2>becoming infected.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a country where almost half of </v>

247
00:12:51.991 --> 00:12:52.824
<v Speaker 2>the crop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so irrigators and they have managed to </v>

248
00:12:54.301 --> 00:12:55.134
<v Speaker 2>decrease their water consumption by </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 90% further agricultural product </v>

249
00:12:59.281 --> 00:13:02.690
<v Speaker 2>exports surpassed 92 billion euros last </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

250
00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.073
<v Speaker 2>Not any of that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hololens is also making money by </v>

251
00:13:05.730 --> 00:13:06.563
<v Speaker 2>exporting that technology.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United Arab Emirates goes Dutch to </v>

252
00:13:13.191 --> 00:13:14.450
<v Speaker 2>ensure their food security.</v>

253
00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:19.233
<v Speaker 2>So the question now becomes do you think</v>
<v Speaker 2>other countries can import these kinds </v>

254
00:13:22.091 --> 00:13:24.850
<v Speaker 2>of policies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How far in the technologies developed in</v>

255
00:13:24.851 --> 00:13:27.280
<v Speaker 2>Hollins go to feed the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world?</v>

256
00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:29.710
<v Speaker 2>I'll leave your answer in the comments </v>
