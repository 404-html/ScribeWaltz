00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.050
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:08.353
<v Speaker 2>many of you have written to us asking </v>
<v Speaker 2>for a video about what's going on in </v>

3
00:00:10.911 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 2>Turkey and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation there is quite dangerous.</v>

4
00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.410
<v Speaker 2>And in case you were wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nope,</v>

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:18.020
<v Speaker 2>this time Donald Trump is not to blame </v>
<v Speaker 2>for this.</v>

6
00:00:18.021 --> 00:00:18.854
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s sanctions are just the tip of </v>

7
00:00:20.481 --> 00:00:21.314
<v Speaker 2>the iceberg here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is an iceberg that could wreck </v>

8
00:00:23.141 --> 00:00:23.974
<v Speaker 2>many ships.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so when we say ships we really mean </v>

9
00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.540
<v Speaker 2>European banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just look at the map we're showing.</v>

10
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:29.453
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

11
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.050
<v Speaker 2>Tuckey is a bridge between Europe and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia.</v>

12
00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.590
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a country with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>population as big as Germany,</v>

13
00:00:38.591 --> 00:00:41.920
<v Speaker 2>a country where Europe has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing for decades,</v>

14
00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:43.000
<v Speaker 2>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>factories,</v>

15
00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.210
<v Speaker 2>and of course there are lots and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 2>loans.</v>

16
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.500
<v Speaker 2>One an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

17
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.330
<v Speaker 2>hey you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard of bb?</v>

18
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.930
<v Speaker 2>Va is the second biggest bank in Spain?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

19
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 2>Turkey is the third biggest market for </v>
<v Speaker 2>this bank.</v>

20
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:55.813
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when the Turks Sneeze and lots of </v>

21
00:00:57.341 --> 00:01:01.150
<v Speaker 2>Europeans end up with a Kohl's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm scared enough yet.</v>

22
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.090
<v Speaker 2>Well listen up.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey isn't important.</v>

23
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:04.953
<v Speaker 2>NATO member for America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have the biggest army in the </v>

24
00:01:10.631 --> 00:01:11.464
<v Speaker 2>alliance and they are one of the few </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries with a Muslim majority and </v>

25
00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.020
<v Speaker 2>secular constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at least for now.</v>

26
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard that rice we said so far,</v>

27
00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.780
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that the Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>president,</v>

28
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:25.663
<v Speaker 2>while he has not a big fan of secularism</v>
<v Speaker 2>or when there's something like the </v>

29
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:29.793
<v Speaker 2>antiquing Skywalker of politics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he started out as the good guy in the </v>

30
00:01:32.741 --> 00:01:36.190
<v Speaker 2>movie boss.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all know that eventually it will fall</v>

31
00:01:36.191 --> 00:01:37.390
<v Speaker 2>to the dark side.</v>

32
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.983
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the dock side is a mix between a </v>

33
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.890
<v Speaker 2>religious fanaticism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

34
00:01:47.891 --> 00:01:51.070
<v Speaker 2>good old populism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want likes to portray himself as</v>

35
00:01:51.071 --> 00:01:51.904
<v Speaker 2>the defender of the average man.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those tax that live in rural areas like </v>

36
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.923
<v Speaker 2>Kanya.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I completely outside of the Glamor of </v>

37
00:01:57.461 --> 00:01:58.294
<v Speaker 2>his stumble,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tax that they don't have amazing </v>

38
00:01:59.951 --> 00:02:03.190
<v Speaker 2>salaries and they maintain a traditional</v>
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle as well.</v>

39
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:05.350
<v Speaker 2>Who Do these people need to be protected</v>
<v Speaker 2>against?</v>

40
00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.213
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course that would be the western </v>

41
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:11.950
<v Speaker 2>conspiracy that wants to end Turkey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This explains why it,</v>

42
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.590
<v Speaker 2>because this is so important for to </v>
<v Speaker 2>one's narrow</v>

43
00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:18.663
<v Speaker 2>us impose sanctions and Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials over the paint American </v>

44
00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.310
<v Speaker 2>pastor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

45
00:02:24.311 --> 00:02:27.610
<v Speaker 2>this is just the tip of the iceberg.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>

46
00:02:27.611 --> 00:02:28.444
<v Speaker 2>the actual reason behind the US </v>
<v Speaker 2>sanctions is not the pastor that's the </v>

47
00:02:31.691 --> 00:02:34.960
<v Speaker 2>military and sanctions with the Kurds in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria,</v>

48
00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.240
<v Speaker 2>but that's another story for another </v>
<v Speaker 2>video.</v>

49
00:02:37.241 --> 00:02:38.074
<v Speaker 2>The truth is Turkey's crisis has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>going on for three years already and </v>

50
00:02:41.081 --> 00:02:43.600
<v Speaker 2>this isn't just a political crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

51
00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.583
<v Speaker 2>the biggest problem is economics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a small scale of </v>

52
00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right at the very gates of Europe.</v>

53
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.950
<v Speaker 2>But now the question is what is going on</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Turkey?</v>

54
00:02:53.951 --> 00:02:54.784
<v Speaker 2>What happens in this country to cause </v>
<v Speaker 2>them to fall to the dark side of </v>

55
00:02:57.941 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 2>economics and do we really have to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>scattered today?</v>

56
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:03.580
<v Speaker 2>We're going to answer all of these </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

57
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:05.590
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as always,</v>

58
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.140
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the huddle.</v>

59
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.330
<v Speaker 1>Strange Erdogan,</v>

60
00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:14.510
<v Speaker 2>the savior,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so he is famous for Mary thinks,</v>

61
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.373
<v Speaker 2>seems Sophia Kebab sins inflation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since 1970 and until the year 2000 </v>

62
00:03:23.531 --> 00:03:26.380
<v Speaker 2>Turkey had sky high inflation rates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many years,</v>

63
00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.303
<v Speaker 2>they even surpass the 100% mark.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that from one year to the </v>

64
00:03:30.971 --> 00:03:33.010
<v Speaker 2>next,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prices would double.</v>

65
00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.963
<v Speaker 2>And what happens when you have so much </v>
<v Speaker 2>inflation and you live so close to </v>

66
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.220
<v Speaker 2>wealthy European countries?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

67
00:03:39.221 --> 00:03:40.054
<v Speaker 2>you become a cheap labor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Disneyland's companies like Renault of </v>

68
00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.510
<v Speaker 2>Persia builds lots of factories in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey.</v>

69
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.630
<v Speaker 2>But hold on a second because I can guess</v>
<v Speaker 2>when you're probably thinking right now,</v>

70
00:03:54.631 --> 00:03:56.250
<v Speaker 2>you're probably thinking about,</v>
<v Speaker 2>okay Simon,</v>

71
00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.010
<v Speaker 2>but isn't this actually good news for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>

72
00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes and no.</v>

73
00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:03.150
<v Speaker 2>At the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

74
00:04:03.151 --> 00:04:05.830
<v Speaker 2>in the 1960s Renno opens a factory in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bursar,</v>

75
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.750
<v Speaker 2>a city in northern Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>manufacturing cars in Bursar.</v>

76
00:04:08.751 --> 00:04:10.110
<v Speaker 2>It was very cheap for rent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>

77
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.140
<v Speaker 2>since the Turkish lira was devaluing </v>
<v Speaker 2>year after year,</v>

78
00:04:13.141 --> 00:04:15.780
<v Speaker 2>Renno had to pay the lower and lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>salaries.</v>

79
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:21.323
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

80
00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.973
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when they got the money from selling </v>

81
00:04:23.791 --> 00:04:24.624
<v Speaker 2>those cars of the era,</v>
<v Speaker 2>rarely think they kept it inside Turkey </v>

82
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.860
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see they've Turkish money.</v>

83
00:04:28.861 --> 00:04:29.694
<v Speaker 2>It was losing value so fast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The smartest thing you could do with </v>

84
00:04:31.501 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>your money was take it out of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country as well,</v>

85
00:04:33.601 --> 00:04:34.434
<v Speaker 2>fast as you possibly could.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why Turkey seemed doomed to </v>

86
00:04:38.101 --> 00:04:41.860
<v Speaker 2>stagnation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That was until the year 2003 that's the,</v>

87
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:43.320
<v Speaker 2>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] came to power.</v>

88
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.730
<v Speaker 2>His main goal was to keep inflation </v>
<v Speaker 2>below 10%.</v>

89
00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:55.190
<v Speaker 2>It created a new car and see the Turkish</v>
<v Speaker 2>lira.</v>

90
00:04:55.191 --> 00:04:57.710
<v Speaker 2>This was a currency far more stable than</v>
<v Speaker 2>the previous,</v>

91
00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:10.140
<v Speaker 2>and as soon as inflation was enhance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turkish economy is made a 180 degree</v>

92
00:05:10.361 --> 00:05:11.740
<v Speaker 2>shift.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>

93
00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:14.380
<v Speaker 2>many European companies started </v>
<v Speaker 2>investing in Turkey.</v>

94
00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.270
<v Speaker 2>This included banks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>One of them,</v>

95
00:05:16.271 --> 00:05:20.110
<v Speaker 2>the Spanish bbb we mentioned previously </v>
<v Speaker 2>invested in this country,</v>

96
00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:21.250
<v Speaker 2>big time.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

97
00:05:21.251 --> 00:05:24.520
<v Speaker 2>so much so that now Turkey is the third </v>
<v Speaker 2>largest market.</v>

98
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:25.383
<v Speaker 2>So in the two thousands Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was in fashion rule of law ans </v>

99
00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>monetary stability.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Men,</v>

100
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:31.900
<v Speaker 2>the company has good reinvest in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

101
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.840
<v Speaker 2>So if less than 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>your average Turkish work,</v>

102
00:05:34.841 --> 00:05:39.841
<v Speaker 2>it went from making 800 US dollars a </v>
<v Speaker 2>month to making more than $1,200</v>

103
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:45.370
<v Speaker 1>it's a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mother knew</v>

104
00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 2>that in those first oto in years and new</v>
<v Speaker 2>industries like tourism develops,</v>

105
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.310
<v Speaker 2>Turkey went from 13 million tourists to </v>
<v Speaker 2>39 million.</v>

106
00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.610
<v Speaker 2>And what Turkish companies?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

107
00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:59.543
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard of Turkish Airlines </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties Turkish Airlines was </v>

108
00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:03.103
<v Speaker 2>just another carrier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but since they can now reinvest that </v>

109
00:06:05.511 --> 00:06:06.344
<v Speaker 2>profit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they ended up becoming an aviation </v>

110
00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:09.490
<v Speaker 2>juggernauts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

111
00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:13.040
<v Speaker 2>believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not an isolated case.</v>

112
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.933
<v Speaker 2>If there's one great example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish men are old and it has to be </v>

113
00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:18.110
<v Speaker 2>yelled as holdings.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This company,</v>

114
00:06:18.111 --> 00:06:18.944
<v Speaker 2>it started out as a family owned bakery </v>
<v Speaker 2>and now they've already bought European </v>

115
00:06:21.921 --> 00:06:25.190
<v Speaker 2>brands like godiva chocolates or united </v>
<v Speaker 2>biscuits.</v>

116
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:26.053
<v Speaker 2>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yielders holdings is the world's third </v>

117
00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>biggest company in the entire food </v>
<v Speaker 2>sector.</v>

118
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:32.990
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Turkish economy,</v>

119
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:33.853
<v Speaker 2>it was absolutely on fire.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Zia Company who was on the line that </v>

120
00:06:41.711 --> 00:06:42.544
<v Speaker 2>would really seem to care that one had </v>
<v Speaker 2>been to prison for being a part of a </v>

121
00:06:45.341 --> 00:06:47.140
<v Speaker 2>radical group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>

122
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.220
<v Speaker 2>the country was still democratic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Another one was the Arab rock star.</v>

123
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.143
<v Speaker 2>He was the chosen one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was the one who was going to bring </v>

124
00:06:53.531 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 2>the Islamic wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's the bright side.</v>

125
00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.640
<v Speaker 2>Bags in Turkey wanted to be European.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were just about to the Karma member</v>

126
00:07:00.641 --> 00:07:01.474
<v Speaker 2>of the European Union as a fun fact in </v>
<v Speaker 2>2003 they even won the eurovision song </v>

127
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:05.944
<v Speaker 2>contest</v>

128
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.270
<v Speaker 2>last,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you might know,</v>

129
00:07:11.271 --> 00:07:16.271
<v Speaker 2>the negotiations to become a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>EU extended over a really long time.</v>

130
00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:18.020
<v Speaker 2>So what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

131
00:07:18.021 --> 00:07:20.660
<v Speaker 2>over one lost his patients and he </v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially said,</v>

132
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:21.261
<v Speaker 2>oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what?</v>

133
00:07:21.261 --> 00:07:23.120
<v Speaker 2>So I'm not cool enough to join your </v>
<v Speaker 2>club.</v>

134
00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.050
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know what?</v>

135
00:07:24.110 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of being western.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of a separation of powers.</v>

136
00:07:27.531 --> 00:07:29.870
<v Speaker 2>I'm tired of secularism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of that.</v>

137
00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:32.750
<v Speaker 2>It's now over.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now is the time.</v>

138
00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:40.960
<v Speaker 2>In the last five years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things started to sour.</v>

139
00:07:40.961 --> 00:07:41.794
<v Speaker 2>Third one first,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was personally involved in many </v>

140
00:07:43.391 --> 00:07:47.170
<v Speaker 2>corruption cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but worst of all was news like this</v>

141
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:52.440
<v Speaker 3>Istanbul,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Ataturk airport attack,</v>

142
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:55.860
<v Speaker 3>41 dead and more than 230 hurt</v>

143
00:07:55.980 --> 00:07:56.813
<v Speaker 2>Dasha tax of brought Islamic terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and insecurity to the streets of Turkey </v>

144
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.820
<v Speaker 2>and the damage to the tourism industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a media in just two years.</v>

145
00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:04.673
<v Speaker 2>Tourism income has fallen by 25% and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this is especially worrying given the </v>

146
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:11.710
<v Speaker 2>tourism accounts for 13% of the Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

147
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:15.880
<v Speaker 2>But that's not all foreign investment </v>
<v Speaker 2>has fallen by half.</v>

148
00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.080
<v Speaker 2>And I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering,</v>

149
00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.500
<v Speaker 2>well why?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well there are two reasons for this.</v>

150
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.860
<v Speaker 2>The first one is the lack of a chance </v>
<v Speaker 2>that Turkey is going to become a part of</v>

151
00:08:23.861 --> 00:08:24.694
<v Speaker 2>the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the second one while I was out of </v>

152
00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:27.633
<v Speaker 2>one himself.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes [inaudible] Islamic radicalism is </v>

153
00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:34.870
<v Speaker 2>not just a danger politics wise.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is also a danger for economics.</v>

154
00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:36.913
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>

155
00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:41.930
<v Speaker 3>he's earned a one calls,</v>
<v Speaker 3>interest rates the mother of all evil.</v>

156
00:08:42.590 --> 00:08:43.850
<v Speaker 3>The lira slides</v>

157
00:08:44.100 --> 00:08:44.933
<v Speaker 2>according to Ottawa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called Economic Orthodoxy is a </v>

158
00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.320
<v Speaker 2>Western invention that will destabilize </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkey borrowing money with interesting.</v>

159
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.273
<v Speaker 2>It goes against Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he runs to the central bank and </v>

160
00:08:55.111 --> 00:08:58.410
<v Speaker 2>forced them to lower the interest rates </v>
<v Speaker 2>and start printing money.</v>

161
00:08:58.500 --> 00:09:00.540
<v Speaker 2>And what if the central bank and when he</v>
<v Speaker 2>refused and he said,</v>

162
00:09:00.630 --> 00:09:02.370
<v Speaker 2>I just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I just don't want to do that.</v>

163
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:04.800
<v Speaker 2>Well these are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I don't want as well</v>

164
00:09:07.370 --> 00:09:07.950
<v Speaker 1>central.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

165
00:09:07.950 --> 00:09:08.783
<v Speaker 2>Thank can't take this independence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>set aside the signals given by the </v>

166
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:14.910
<v Speaker 2>president or to one speaking to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bloomberg.</v>

167
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:16.013
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after the failed coup to tar of 2016 oh </v>

168
00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:20.520
<v Speaker 2>one has finally fallen into the dark </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

169
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:27.623
<v Speaker 2>he thinks he can manage the economy at </v>
<v Speaker 2>his will and to every rational critic </v>

170
00:09:31.291 --> 00:09:32.124
<v Speaker 2>against his economic policy is seen as a</v>
<v Speaker 2>western conspiracy that he even named </v>

171
00:09:35.851 --> 00:09:40.500
<v Speaker 2>his son in law as the finance minister.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This new economic paradigm is not a free</v>

172
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:43.920
<v Speaker 2>markets or social democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is the new,</v>

173
00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:45.113
<v Speaker 2>I don't want to nominate.</v>

174
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:49.603
<v Speaker 1>Do you mean</v>

175
00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:52.940
<v Speaker 2>money to pay?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You feel spending wild,</v>

176
00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.330
<v Speaker 2>you simply princess,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll Turkish companies complaining flood</v>

177
00:09:56.331 --> 00:09:58.640
<v Speaker 2>the market with chief credit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In less than two years,</v>

178
00:09:58.641 --> 00:09:59.474
<v Speaker 2>Turkish banks have given more than $50 </v>
<v Speaker 2>billion worth of loans and all of this </v>

179
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.750
<v Speaker 2>is with almost no interest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The results,</v>

180
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:06.853
<v Speaker 2>well that's a crazy devaluation of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish lira 2014 the exchange rate </v>

181
00:10:10.671 --> 00:10:14.570
<v Speaker 2>between the US dollar and the Turkish </v>
<v Speaker 2>lira was about 2.5</v>

182
00:10:14.571 --> 00:10:17.510
<v Speaker 2>Liros to the dollar at the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>making of this video.</v>

183
00:10:17.511 --> 00:10:18.830
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the exchange rate,</v>

184
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.990
<v Speaker 2>is it more than six lyrice to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>dollar?</v>

185
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:24.770
<v Speaker 2>This means that the Turkish lira has </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost two thirds of its value compared to</v>

186
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:25.604
<v Speaker 2>four years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's also partially accounts for why </v>

187
00:10:27.921 --> 00:10:31.400
<v Speaker 2>inflation rates have risen so high to </v>
<v Speaker 2>11.9%</v>

188
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:32.360
<v Speaker 2>in the end of 27</v>

189
00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.223
<v Speaker 1>t</v>

190
00:10:36.830 --> 00:10:37.550
<v Speaker 2>all right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

191
00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.810
<v Speaker 2>I don't want you to thinking I live in </v>
<v Speaker 2>boy.</v>

192
00:10:38.811 --> 00:10:39.644
<v Speaker 2>9% doesn't sound so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean in Argentina they have three </v>

193
00:10:42.171 --> 00:10:43.004
<v Speaker 2>times that inflation is the truth is </v>
<v Speaker 2>that you need some time between a </v>

194
00:10:45.381 --> 00:10:48.440
<v Speaker 2>devaluation and the rise in day to day </v>
<v Speaker 2>prices.</v>

195
00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.620
<v Speaker 2>So who were the first ones suffering the</v>
<v Speaker 2>effects of this deflation?</v>

196
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>those would be the companies that had </v>

197
00:10:53.391 --> 00:10:56.450
<v Speaker 2>loans in foreign bank and there are more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than a few of them.</v>

198
00:10:56.490 --> 00:10:58.820
<v Speaker 2>You really yielders holdings the food </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry bm off.</v>

199
00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:00.320
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here you go.</v>

200
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.273
<v Speaker 2>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Turkish owner of Godiva chocolate to </v>

201
00:11:06.251 --> 00:11:07.084
<v Speaker 2>restructure,</v>
<v Speaker 2>six point $5 billion worth of debt </v>

202
00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.323
<v Speaker 2>estimation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Say that foreign debt from salvage </v>

203
00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:15.430
<v Speaker 2>companies to surpass is $300 billion for</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lesser understanding.</v>

204
00:11:15.431 --> 00:11:16.264
<v Speaker 2>This is the same amount of money spent </v>
<v Speaker 2>in all of the bailouts of Greece and </v>

205
00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 2>meanwhile the inflation rate is starting</v>
<v Speaker 2>to grow little by little this year,</v>

206
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:24.544
<v Speaker 2>2018 it's already reached 15% since all </v>
<v Speaker 2>the nongovernmental estimation saying </v>

207
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:32.500
<v Speaker 2>that at the beginning of 2019 it's going</v>
<v Speaker 2>to rise to 22%</v>

208
00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:33.923
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

209
00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:37.143
<v Speaker 2>Turkey's software and credit rating cut </v>
<v Speaker 2>deeper into junk as s and p seized </v>

210
00:11:40.841 --> 00:11:42.600
<v Speaker 2>recession next year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Add to this,</v>

211
00:11:42.601 --> 00:11:43.434
<v Speaker 2>the sanctions imposed by Donald Trump.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to talk about the reasons </v>

212
00:11:46.051 --> 00:11:46.884
<v Speaker 2>behind the sanctions in another video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but here we want to focus on the </v>

213
00:11:49.621 --> 00:11:51.480
<v Speaker 2>economics because in the middle of all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>

214
00:11:51.481 --> 00:11:54.670
<v Speaker 2>there is another player with a lot the </v>
<v Speaker 2>loose and that's the European.</v>

215
00:11:54.671 --> 00:11:54.800
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

216
00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:55.633
<v Speaker 1>union.</v>

217
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:01.223
<v Speaker 2>Thanks like the Spanish Ppva and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fringe and BNP of paradise or the </v>

218
00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.793
<v Speaker 2>Italian unicredit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As I've learned more than $190 billion </v>

219
00:12:07.681 --> 00:12:08.514
<v Speaker 2>to Turkish companies so far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>BBV has already lost half of the value </v>

220
00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:13.193
<v Speaker 2>of those investments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you can already imagine the big gap </v>

221
00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.870
<v Speaker 2>that a Turkish collapse would leave so </v>
<v Speaker 2>far out.</v>

222
00:12:18.871 --> 00:12:22.560
<v Speaker 2>Again has said that he won't ask for a </v>
<v Speaker 2>bailouts from the International Monetary</v>

223
00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:25.230
<v Speaker 2>Fund and he will not raise capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>controls either.</v>

224
00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:29.500
<v Speaker 2>But Kenny really stick to his words.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We just don't know here.</v>

225
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.593
<v Speaker 2>All we know is that both Qatar and China</v>
<v Speaker 2>have already promised to help for </v>

226
00:12:33.241 --> 00:12:34.074
<v Speaker 2>Turkish economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is still too soon to tell what's </v>

227
00:12:36.421 --> 00:12:37.254
<v Speaker 2>going to happen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

228
00:12:38.510 --> 00:12:39.343
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:12:41.750 --> 00:12:42.583
<v Speaker 2>So now the question really goes to you.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think Turkey will become the </v>

230
00:12:45.651 --> 00:12:46.484
<v Speaker 2>European Venezuela?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could this localized crisis creates a </v>

231
00:12:49.011 --> 00:12:52.250
<v Speaker 2>bigger crisis all across Europe?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Could add one pull.</v>

232
00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.990
<v Speaker 2>Everybody is the dark side.</v>

233
00:12:56.870 --> 00:13:00.320
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
