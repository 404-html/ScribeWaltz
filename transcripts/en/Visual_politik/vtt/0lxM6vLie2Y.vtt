<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:08.303
<v Speaker 2>Here's the question.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everyone's been wondering for the past </v>

3
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.183
<v Speaker 2>few days,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would happen if both North Korea </v>

4
00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.320
<v Speaker 2>and South Korea merged in z one single </v>
<v Speaker 2>nation?</v>

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.930
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know this isn't something that's going</v>

6
00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:18.764
<v Speaker 2>to happen in the near future,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it certainly is a possibility and </v>

7
00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.780
<v Speaker 2>one that might actually happen sooner </v>
<v Speaker 2>than we expect.</v>

8
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.420
<v Speaker 2>Just one year ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nobody would have predicted that.</v>

9
00:00:27.421 --> 00:00:28.254
<v Speaker 2>Now in the spring of 2018 Kim Jong UN </v>
<v Speaker 2>would shake hands with the South Korean </v>

10
00:00:32.971 --> 00:00:33.804
<v Speaker 2>President Moon Gin.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what would a Korean reunification </v>

11
00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.913
<v Speaker 2>look like?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that is historical </v>

12
00:00:43.751 --> 00:00:45.340
<v Speaker 2>precedent and for all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

13
00:00:45.341 --> 00:00:49.300
<v Speaker 2>my day view is of course I'm talking </v>
<v Speaker 2>about German reunification.</v>

14
00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.660
<v Speaker 2>As you may remember,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>

15
00:00:50.661 --> 00:00:51.494
<v Speaker 2>he used to be divided into two separate </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries and eastern block with a </v>

16
00:00:53.991 --> 00:00:57.730
<v Speaker 2>socialist communist regime and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Western block with a capitalist system,</v>

17
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:05.610
<v Speaker 2>Berlin Wall came down and East Germany </v>
<v Speaker 2>was absorbed by Westerman and since then</v>

18
00:01:05.611 --> 00:01:06.444
<v Speaker 2>the government has spent lots of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>so that the eastern Germans could enjoy </v>

19
00:01:08.761 --> 00:01:11.280
<v Speaker 2>a similar lifestyle to the wealthier </v>
<v Speaker 2>western Germans.</v>

20
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.770
<v Speaker 2>Many experts consider this a success </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

21
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.633
<v Speaker 2>Some of them claimed that this could be </v>
<v Speaker 2>a model for what the integration of </v>

22
00:01:17.521 --> 00:01:19.440
<v Speaker 2>North and South Korea might look like.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

23
00:01:19.441 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 2>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In both cases,</v>

24
00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 2>there's capitalism and socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In both cases.</v>

25
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:25.980
<v Speaker 2>One side is Paul,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while the other side as wealthy,</v>

26
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.920
<v Speaker 2>and in both cases they share a common </v>
<v Speaker 2>language,</v>

27
00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.260
<v Speaker 2>common history,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to come in.</v>

28
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.843
<v Speaker 2>But now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what was the German reunification as </v>

29
00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:38.664
<v Speaker 2>successful as it looks on paper?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we say East Germans today aren't </v>

30
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:44.040
<v Speaker 2>doing as well as their western Nader's?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

31
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.440
<v Speaker 2>the answer is no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even in soccer,</v>

32
00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:49.170
<v Speaker 2>we can see small differences.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since Germany was reunited,</v>

33
00:01:49.171 --> 00:01:50.004
<v Speaker 2>there've been no eastern teams in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bundesliga since 2009 the western teams </v>

34
00:01:53.761 --> 00:01:56.430
<v Speaker 2>still dominate the national sport.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

35
00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.450
<v Speaker 2>there is only one east German team in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Buddhists Liga,</v>

36
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:00.373
<v Speaker 2>the rb Leipzig,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's just one team and a soccer </v>

37
00:02:02.491 --> 00:02:06.000
<v Speaker 2>league of over 18 teams.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the same applies in economics.</v>

38
00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.840
<v Speaker 2>But where the differences turn more </v>
<v Speaker 2>scary is when we talk about politics.</v>

39
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.550
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last election,</v>

40
00:02:11.551 --> 00:02:15.960
<v Speaker 2>the radical rightwing afd has ended the </v>
<v Speaker 2>parliament as the third largest party.</v>

41
00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:19.860
<v Speaker 2>This radical anti immigrants and euro </v>
<v Speaker 2>skeptic party has gained the majority of</v>

42
00:02:19.861 --> 00:02:23.010
<v Speaker 2>its vote from regions in the former East</v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany.</v>

43
00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.903
<v Speaker 2>This is mark the first time since 1961 </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a far right party that says this </v>

44
00:02:27.241 --> 00:02:28.074
<v Speaker 2>kind of presence in German parliaments </v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's a view is actually pretty </v>

45
00:02:30.931 --> 00:02:35.120
<v Speaker 2>frightening.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Benj of the east.</v>

46
00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.270
<v Speaker 2>How anger in former GDR helped the afd.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the real question here is this is the</v>

47
00:02:41.301 --> 00:02:42.134
<v Speaker 2>process of reunification done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What can we learn from Germany if it </v>

48
00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 2>could be applied to north and South </v>
<v Speaker 2>Korea?</v>

49
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.913
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we aren't going to answer this </v>

50
00:02:49.971 --> 00:02:50.990
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>

51
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:52.003
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look back at the history to</v>
<v Speaker 2>the victors go the spoils often or it's </v>

52
00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:57.703
<v Speaker 2>unconditional surrender,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the allies divided and to for military </v>

53
00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 2>occupation zones,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Britain in the northwest,</v>

54
00:03:03.281 --> 00:03:04.390
<v Speaker 2>France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the southwest,</v>

55
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.780
<v Speaker 2>the USA and the south and the Soviet </v>
<v Speaker 2>Union in the east.</v>

56
00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.930
<v Speaker 2>There's a lot more we could say about </v>
<v Speaker 2>this time,</v>

57
00:03:12.931 --> 00:03:15.290
<v Speaker 2>but we're not going to go into every </v>
<v Speaker 2>little detail because,</v>

58
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.781
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we did,</v>

59
00:03:15.781 --> 00:03:18.000
<v Speaker 2>you'd be staring at my face for a couple</v>
<v Speaker 2>of hours.</v>

60
00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But suffice it to say that from 1949 </v>

61
00:03:20.611 --> 00:03:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Germany was transformed into two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different countries.</v>

62
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.293
<v Speaker 2>West Germany officially known as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Federal Republic of Germany with on as </v>

63
00:03:27.601 --> 00:03:28.434
<v Speaker 2>its capital and East Germany whose </v>
<v Speaker 2>official name was the Democratic </v>

64
00:03:30.781 --> 00:03:32.970
<v Speaker 2>Republic of Germany with its capital and</v>
<v Speaker 2>East Berlin.</v>

65
00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:35.160
<v Speaker 2>East Germany was the communist region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

66
00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:38.100
<v Speaker 2>West Germany became the embodiment of </v>
<v Speaker 2>its capitalists.</v>

67
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:38.963
<v Speaker 2>Occupants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While West Berlin started to look more </v>

68
00:03:40.741 --> 00:03:43.140
<v Speaker 2>and more like a big city would in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>

69
00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.390
<v Speaker 2>east Berlin became Moscow's carbon.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

70
00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.273
<v Speaker 1>Top.</v>

71
00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.520
<v Speaker 2>According to East Germany's first </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

72
00:03:50.521 --> 00:03:52.710
<v Speaker 2>its citizens enjoyed certain basic </v>
<v Speaker 2>rights,</v>

73
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:53.623
<v Speaker 2>even the rights to strike,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but in reality it was a little freedom </v>

74
00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.470
<v Speaker 2>or policy related matters were decided </v>
<v Speaker 2>by the Pellissippi Eric,</v>

75
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.920
<v Speaker 2>the executive committee of the Socialist</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unity Party.</v>

76
00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:02.893
<v Speaker 2>That's the main and almost only source </v>
<v Speaker 2>of information in the country was </v>

77
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:07.223
<v Speaker 2>directly financed by the only party.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here's a great example of just how </v>

78
00:04:10.351 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 2>unbiased it was.</v>

79
00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:14.980
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

80
00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 2>The Central Oregon of the Socialist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Unity Party celebrating 100 years of the</v>

81
00:04:19.541 --> 00:04:22.160
<v Speaker 2>communist manifesto.</v>
<v Speaker 2>East Germany's economy,</v>

82
00:04:22.161 --> 00:04:22.994
<v Speaker 2>as you may have already guessed,</v>
<v Speaker 2>was it century plans and almost </v>

83
00:04:25.041 --> 00:04:25.874
<v Speaker 2>completely owned by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the central governments at the price of </v>

84
00:04:28.401 --> 00:04:30.950
<v Speaker 2>housing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>basic goods and even services.</v>

85
00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.903
<v Speaker 2>So basically every year the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>would publish a list with the mandatory </v>

86
00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:37.910
<v Speaker 2>prices of every basic good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You'd want to buy a bread roll,</v>

87
00:04:37.911 --> 00:04:38.744
<v Speaker 2>five marks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a thousand bucks for a Sony Walkman and </v>

88
00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.280
<v Speaker 2>so on and so forth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even if you had the money,</v>

89
00:04:43.281 --> 00:04:46.370
<v Speaker 2>there were waiting lists in place for </v>
<v Speaker 2>goods like cars and electronics.</v>

90
00:04:46.371 --> 00:04:48.830
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who really wants to wait 10 years to get</v>

91
00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:51.770
<v Speaker 2>a travel card?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take the unemployment generated by these</v>

92
00:04:51.771 --> 00:04:52.970
<v Speaker 2>strips,</v>
<v Speaker 2>price control,</v>

93
00:04:52.971 --> 00:04:57.971
<v Speaker 2>take all of those empty supermarkets,</v>
<v Speaker 2>take the scarcity of primary basic goods</v>

94
00:04:58.101 --> 00:05:01.850
<v Speaker 2>and pair those with aliments like a low </v>
<v Speaker 2>birth rate and guess what?</v>

95
00:05:01.851 --> 00:05:04.670
<v Speaker 2>You guys,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you got lots and lots of people who want</v>

96
00:05:04.671 --> 00:05:05.504
<v Speaker 2>to escape.</v>

97
00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.383
<v Speaker 1>Jen,</v>

98
00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:13.050
<v Speaker 2>what did the government do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

99
00:05:13.051 --> 00:05:13.884
<v Speaker 2>they built a wall to stop people leaving</v>
<v Speaker 2>the country in order to justify this </v>

100
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:17.413
<v Speaker 2>movie.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The official state propaganda claims </v>

101
00:05:18.661 --> 00:05:21.900
<v Speaker 2>that they were building the walls.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You protected their country from fascist</v>

102
00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:24.570
<v Speaker 2>infiltration.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That the actual reason it was exactly,</v>

103
00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:25.593
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

104
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.870
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what would having a literal wall between</v>

105
00:05:34.871 --> 00:05:35.704
<v Speaker 2>them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the relationship between east and West </v>

106
00:05:37.541 --> 00:05:40.060
<v Speaker 2>Germany wasn't exactly friendly.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

107
00:05:40.061 --> 00:05:40.894
<v Speaker 2>West Germany didn't even recognize the </v>
<v Speaker 2>East German government because they </v>

108
00:05:43.091 --> 00:05:43.924
<v Speaker 2>claim to be the only legitimate state </v>
<v Speaker 2>for all Janice and to the east did the </v>

109
00:05:48.071 --> 00:05:48.904
<v Speaker 2>same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this might actually remind you of </v>

110
00:05:50.621 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

111
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.040
<v Speaker 2>It's more or less the relationship that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the two careers have with each other.</v>

112
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Although in the former case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were no nuclear bombs involved and</v>

113
00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.260
<v Speaker 2>just like north and South Korea raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>reaching an agreement,</v>

114
00:06:00.261 --> 00:06:01.094
<v Speaker 2>east and West Germany normalize their </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations in the 1970s but the real </v>

115
00:06:04.341 --> 00:06:05.174
<v Speaker 2>twist in history that came in the year </v>
<v Speaker 2>1989 no one could have anticipated that </v>

116
00:06:15.081 --> 00:06:18.590
<v Speaker 2>the 40th anniversary of the GDR would </v>
<v Speaker 2>also be,</v>

117
00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:22.040
<v Speaker 2>it's lost and that Germany would be </v>
<v Speaker 2>reunited one small,</v>

118
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:26.690
<v Speaker 2>but then history if found a way to </v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise us all the speed at which these</v>

119
00:06:26.691 --> 00:06:27.524
<v Speaker 2>changes occurred with astounding only 10</v>
<v Speaker 2>months after the fall of the wall east </v>

120
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:34.400
<v Speaker 2>and West Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'd become a single nation.</v>

121
00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.820
<v Speaker 2>The new Germany has here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>secretary of state,</v>

122
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:39.571
<v Speaker 2>James A.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Baker,</v>

123
00:06:39.571 --> 00:06:43.110
<v Speaker 2>the third set,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let her legacy be that after 45 years we</v>

124
00:06:43.111 --> 00:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>finally got the political arithmetic </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

125
00:06:45.420 --> 00:06:46.253
<v Speaker 2>Two plus four adds up to one Germany in </v>
<v Speaker 2>a Europe whole and free bus make no </v>

126
00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:51.834
<v Speaker 2>mistakes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was not a merger between two </v>

127
00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:56.550
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This was a complete absorption.</v>

128
00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:57.503
<v Speaker 2>Basically on October 3rd,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1990 East Germany disappeared as an </v>

129
00:07:00.391 --> 00:07:01.224
<v Speaker 2>independent country and became a part of</v>
<v Speaker 2>West Germany as this was definitely a </v>

130
00:07:05.281 --> 00:07:07.710
<v Speaker 2>good move,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it did have some downsides</v>

131
00:07:10.960 --> 00:07:11.793
<v Speaker 2>reunited at last.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like the two states where one once </v>

132
00:07:15.551 --> 00:07:16.384
<v Speaker 2>more,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but not everything was exactly sunshine </v>

133
00:07:18.281 --> 00:07:19.114
<v Speaker 2>and rainbows.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Huh?</v>

134
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:24.323
<v Speaker 2>Or West Germany was extremely wealthy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and has high productivity and was very </v>

135
00:07:27.361 --> 00:07:30.120
<v Speaker 2>industrialized.</v>
<v Speaker 2>East Germany was the opposite.</v>

136
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.890
<v Speaker 2>The Soviet controlled state at a lower </v>
<v Speaker 2>productivity,</v>

137
00:07:37.100 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 2>less wealth and eight totally different </v>
<v Speaker 2>political system.</v>

138
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.530
<v Speaker 2>Again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was a very similar starting point.</v>

139
00:07:42.531 --> 00:07:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Does that have north and South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>although less extreme,</v>

140
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.783
<v Speaker 2>but the process to be successful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the two states needed to somehow find a </v>

141
00:07:49.521 --> 00:07:53.090
<v Speaker 2>way to unify that two completely </v>
<v Speaker 2>different structures.</v>

142
00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.030
<v Speaker 2>So now the question probably in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>mind as well,</v>

143
00:07:55.031 --> 00:07:56.210
<v Speaker 2>what exactly did they do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

144
00:07:56.211 --> 00:07:59.210
<v Speaker 2>basically West Germany exported all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their laws,</v>

145
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:01.900
<v Speaker 2>their taxes and their regulations to </v>
<v Speaker 2>east German.</v>

146
00:08:07.770 --> 00:08:08.603
<v Speaker 2>In exchange,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they also took care of all the </v>

147
00:08:09.661 --> 00:08:10.494
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure costs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that the western taxpayers </v>

148
00:08:12.481 --> 00:08:14.120
<v Speaker 2>would pay for the highways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the railroads,</v>

149
00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:14.963
<v Speaker 2>and the streets of eastern Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And now I know what you're probably </v>

150
00:08:17.071 --> 00:08:19.290
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This sounds pretty fair,</v>

151
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:19.771
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

152
00:08:19.771 --> 00:08:22.470
<v Speaker 2>if you want to join your poorer neighbor</v>
<v Speaker 2>to create a big country,</v>

153
00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.513
<v Speaker 2>you kind of have to help them recover.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But economics is way more complicated </v>

154
00:08:27.511 --> 00:08:29.790
<v Speaker 2>than just pouring money into something.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

155
00:08:29.820 --> 00:08:34.290
<v Speaker 2>the reunification meant the total </v>
<v Speaker 2>collapse of the whole eastern economy.</v>

156
00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:35.670
<v Speaker 2>And why was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

157
00:08:35.700 --> 00:08:36.840
<v Speaker 2>just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

158
00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:37.733
<v Speaker 2>having a single country means having a </v>
<v Speaker 2>single market to a single market where </v>

159
00:08:41.071 --> 00:08:44.280
<v Speaker 2>Western companies where several times </v>
<v Speaker 2>more productive than that,</v>

160
00:08:44.281 --> 00:08:46.620
<v Speaker 2>eastern counterparts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so east in factories,</v>

161
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:48.570
<v Speaker 2>they just couldn't compete.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

162
00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.300
<v Speaker 2>East Germany produced the famous travel </v>
<v Speaker 2>car.</v>

163
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.430
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>compared with a bmw or an Audi,</v>

164
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.610
<v Speaker 2>a trevor is just a toy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the demand for those cars,</v>

165
00:08:56.790 --> 00:08:59.430
<v Speaker 2>well it just dropped by for day.</v>

166
00:09:01.010 --> 00:09:01.843
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

167
00:09:01.910 --> 00:09:04.220
<v Speaker 2>Many refugees hoping to settle in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>West,</v>

168
00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.083
<v Speaker 2>dump their communists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>built vehicles near the West Germany </v>

169
00:09:07.281 --> 00:09:08.910
<v Speaker 2>embassy in Prague.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Alright,</v>

170
00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:12.080
<v Speaker 2>so imagine the situation you work in a </v>
<v Speaker 2>factory to the company.</v>

171
00:09:12.081 --> 00:09:14.630
<v Speaker 2>It has to close because nobody's buying </v>
<v Speaker 2>their cars.</v>

172
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:17.240
<v Speaker 2>Then you go to the supermarket and </v>
<v Speaker 2>everything you wanted to buy is produced</v>

173
00:09:17.241 --> 00:09:19.760
<v Speaker 2>in the West because well they have the </v>
<v Speaker 2>best factories.</v>

174
00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:20.653
<v Speaker 2>But then again,</v>
<v Speaker 2>everything is more and more expensive </v>

175
00:09:22.251 --> 00:09:23.084
<v Speaker 2>because well surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden you live in a rich </v>

176
00:09:24.861 --> 00:09:28.370
<v Speaker 2>country with really high crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This isn't the end of the story here.</v>

177
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:29.383
<v Speaker 2>I mean imagine you're an old man in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>east and you get a pension that's </v>

178
00:09:31.610 --> 00:09:34.220
<v Speaker 2>calculated based on the prices during </v>
<v Speaker 2>communist times,</v>

179
00:09:34.221 --> 00:09:35.054
<v Speaker 2>but that was 1999 you go to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] and the bread has a western </v>

180
00:09:37.911 --> 00:09:39.140
<v Speaker 2>price,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is terrific.</v>

181
00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:40.063
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

182
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.040
<v Speaker 2>You can probably see where I'm going </v>
<v Speaker 2>with this young people,</v>

183
00:09:46.070 --> 00:09:48.740
<v Speaker 2>I mean at least they could emigrate and </v>
<v Speaker 2>believe me they did,</v>

184
00:09:48.950 --> 00:09:52.310
<v Speaker 2>but what could the elderly do?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And just hold on a second now because on</v>

185
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:54.680
<v Speaker 2>top of all that we have the currency </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchanges.</v>

186
00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:55.553
<v Speaker 2>Do you see the two countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're different currencies with </v>

187
00:09:57.741 --> 00:09:58.574
<v Speaker 2>different values.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So how did they make it work while the </v>

188
00:10:00.861 --> 00:10:02.630
<v Speaker 2>finance ministers of eastern and western</v>
<v Speaker 2>Jimmy,</v>

189
00:10:02.631 --> 00:10:03.464
<v Speaker 2>they met in a room and they decided on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fixed exchange rate between the West </v>

190
00:10:06.950 --> 00:10:07.783
<v Speaker 2>German mark and the East German market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The public demanded a one to one </v>

191
00:10:10.281 --> 00:10:11.114
<v Speaker 2>exchange and on July the first 1990 the </v>
<v Speaker 2>banks in the former eastern Germany </v>

192
00:10:14.270 --> 00:10:17.900
<v Speaker 2>provided people with the unbelievable </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange rate of one to one.</v>

193
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:26.030
<v Speaker 2>I say this isn't quite marks because the</v>
<v Speaker 2>theory was one thing and the reality was</v>

194
00:10:26.031 --> 00:10:26.864
<v Speaker 2>quite another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of the banks would sell you one </v>

195
00:10:28.491 --> 00:10:29.324
<v Speaker 2>western mark for two eastern ones.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is an exchange rate of two to one </v>

196
00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.553
<v Speaker 2>and on the black market,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that exchange rate would be anywhere </v>

197
00:10:35.091 --> 00:10:38.420
<v Speaker 2>from eight to one to 12 to one.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So from one day to the next,</v>

198
00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 2>all the money that you had in your </v>
<v Speaker 2>savings,</v>

199
00:10:40.340 --> 00:10:42.280
<v Speaker 2>we'd lose half of its value.</v>

200
00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.150
<v Speaker 2>So when I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you might be wondering,</v>

201
00:10:47.151 --> 00:10:47.984
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what did the German government do to </v>

202
00:10:48.771 --> 00:10:50.080
<v Speaker 2>manage the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

203
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:53.000
<v Speaker 2>the answer is subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>subsidies,</v>

204
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:53.953
<v Speaker 2>and our whole palm or subsidies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>west German taxpayers paid medical </v>

205
00:10:56.871 --> 00:10:58.310
<v Speaker 2>bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure,</v>

206
00:10:58.490 --> 00:10:59.323
<v Speaker 2>and they were doing everything they </v>
<v Speaker 2>could to prevent eastern Germans from </v>

207
00:11:01.971 --> 00:11:06.170
<v Speaker 2>migrating.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about almost 70 billion US</v>

208
00:11:06.171 --> 00:11:11.171
<v Speaker 2>dollars every single year since 1990 </v>
<v Speaker 2>that is the equivalent of organizing for</v>

209
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:13.880
<v Speaker 2>Olympic Games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Every single,</v>

210
00:11:14.150 --> 00:11:15.380
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>

211
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:17.960
<v Speaker 2>Now I know what you're wondering off to </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost 30 years.</v>

212
00:11:17.961 --> 00:11:18.794
<v Speaker 2>Is this reunification process done?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can we say that Germany is now an equal </v>

213
00:11:22.431 --> 00:11:23.480
<v Speaker 2>country?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

214
00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:27.380
<v Speaker 2>the viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the answer is yes and also no,</v>

215
00:11:33.910 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 2>but not mixed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to one study,</v>

216
00:11:35.931 --> 00:11:36.764
<v Speaker 2>a good share of German state that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>wouldn't marry somebody from the other </v>

217
00:11:39.891 --> 00:11:40.724
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>three quarters of the German population </v>

218
00:11:42.291 --> 00:11:43.124
<v Speaker 2>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are still different mentalities </v>

219
00:11:44.121 --> 00:11:49.121
<v Speaker 2>between the east and the West and 10% of</v>
<v Speaker 2>east Germans have never once traveled to</v>

220
00:11:49.131 --> 00:11:54.131
<v Speaker 2>the other side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course there still differences</v>

221
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.710
<v Speaker 1>in economic terms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you look at this chart,</v>

222
00:11:56.711 --> 00:11:58.600
<v Speaker 1>you can see that at the time of </v>
<v Speaker 1>reunification,</v>

223
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:03.601
<v Speaker 1>the GDP per capita in the east was 9,400</v>
<v Speaker 1>euros as compares to 22,000</v>

224
00:12:04.451 --> 00:12:05.284
<v Speaker 1>euros in the West.</v>

225
00:12:08.810 --> 00:12:11.810
<v Speaker 2>Today it's 27,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>euros and 41,000</v>

226
00:12:11.811 --> 00:12:12.621
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

227
00:12:12.621 --> 00:12:13.454
<v Speaker 2>the differences are more subtle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but nobody can seriously claim that </v>

228
00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.390
<v Speaker 2>there are no differences and of course </v>
<v Speaker 2>we still have the cultural differences.</v>

229
00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.313
<v Speaker 2>A research study done by Jacob </v>
<v Speaker 2>University in Bremen measured community </v>

230
00:12:23.541 --> 00:12:24.374
<v Speaker 2>spirit is considering a number of </v>
<v Speaker 2>factors including trust in institutions </v>

231
00:12:27.171 --> 00:12:31.280
<v Speaker 2>and tolerance towards the Lgbtq </v>
<v Speaker 2>community as well as ethnic minorities.</v>

232
00:12:31.370 --> 00:12:32.203
<v Speaker 2>All the regions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the ones made up east Germany appeared </v>

233
00:12:34.430 --> 00:12:36.050
<v Speaker 2>in the bottom half of the index</v>

234
00:12:41.950 --> 00:12:42.783
<v Speaker 2>and finally we have the political </v>
<v Speaker 2>differences that we can see in the </v>

235
00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:45.873
<v Speaker 2>latest elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Eastern Germans voted for afd of far </v>

236
00:12:48.041 --> 00:12:48.874
<v Speaker 2>right wing party and d Linka of far left</v>
<v Speaker 2>wing party while western Germans chose </v>

237
00:12:52.751 --> 00:12:55.940
<v Speaker 2>more moderate candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This divide in the polls shows house.</v>

238
00:12:55.950 --> 00:12:56.783
<v Speaker 2>Still to this day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>eastern Germans are heavily influenced </v>

239
00:12:58.841 --> 00:12:59.674
<v Speaker 2>by Russian politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is important because one day </v>

240
00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:02.433
<v Speaker 2>eastern Germans could hijack German </v>
<v Speaker 2>politics and destroy that sense of gem </v>

241
00:13:05.591 --> 00:13:06.424
<v Speaker 2>in moderation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now going back to the case of North </v>

242
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.153
<v Speaker 2>Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>imagine what would happen if North </v>

243
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Koreans kept voting for communist </v>
<v Speaker 2>parties.</v>

244
00:13:11.681 --> 00:13:12.514
<v Speaker 2>I mean all of a sudden you have a leader</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Kim Jong and making decisions that </v>

245
00:13:15.941 --> 00:13:19.600
<v Speaker 2>also affect South Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which sounds pretty scary.</v>

246
00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:23.770
<v Speaker 2>Now of course there are many bright </v>
<v Speaker 2>sides do the German reunification,</v>

247
00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:27.040
<v Speaker 2>and as we've mentioned in many of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>videos here at visual politic,</v>

248
00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:29.500
<v Speaker 2>Germany is still a model for other </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

249
00:13:29.501 --> 00:13:30.334
<v Speaker 2>But as we always say,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything is perfect and if there </v>

250
00:13:32.711 --> 00:13:36.990
<v Speaker 2>has to be a Korean reunification,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one day it will not come without.</v>

251
00:13:36.991 --> 00:13:37.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

252
00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.100
<v Speaker 1>Risks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But</v>

253
00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:43.283
<v Speaker 2>now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the eastern Germans could </v>

254
00:13:44.690 --> 00:13:47.060
<v Speaker 2>radicalize the political debates in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Germany?</v>

255
00:13:47.061 --> 00:13:47.894
<v Speaker 2>Do you still feel the German </v>
<v Speaker 2>reunification could be a model for the </v>

256
00:13:51.710 --> 00:13:52.543
<v Speaker 2>Korean Peninsula?</v>
