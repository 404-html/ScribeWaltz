00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.580
<v Speaker 1>Imagine this situation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you live in London and you want to buy a</v>

2
00:00:02.581 --> 00:00:07.350
<v Speaker 1>house in San Francisco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the house costs one point $3 million.</v>

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.243
<v Speaker 1>It's what comes in first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your payments or the handover of the </v>

4
00:00:10.921 --> 00:00:12.720
<v Speaker 1>keys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you happen to pay first,</v>

5
00:00:12.721 --> 00:00:13.554
<v Speaker 1>you might fall into a scam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe the house doesn't really exist or </v>

6
00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>it's not owned by the person that you </v>
<v Speaker 1>contact us.</v>

7
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.180
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget that you can live a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>long way away from that.</v>

8
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:29.580
<v Speaker 1>You never met the person who's selling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the house and believe me,</v>

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 1>you're not the first person or the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to lose money through an online</v>

10
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.250
<v Speaker 1>scam like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ridiculous as it sounds,</v>

11
00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:36.084
<v Speaker 1>this is actually one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated problems that exists in </v>

12
00:00:39.031 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 1>economics and that's trust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But I know what you're thinking.</v>

13
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.090
<v Speaker 1>You click this video expecting something</v>
<v Speaker 1>about blockchain,</v>

14
00:00:45.091 --> 00:00:45.924
<v Speaker 1>about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does all of this I have to deal </v>

15
00:00:49.321 --> 00:00:50.760
<v Speaker 1>with that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

16
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:51.520
<v Speaker 1>I'll tell you,</v>

17
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.353
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

18
00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.773
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays we've all heard of bitcoin and </v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure many of you know of some other </v>

19
00:01:03.111 --> 00:01:04.910
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrencies as well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a theory.</v>

20
00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:05.744
<v Speaker 1>I'm light coin or riddle if you've dug </v>
<v Speaker 1>deeper into this matter and you might </v>

21
00:01:08.181 --> 00:01:13.181
<v Speaker 1>also have heard about another term and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's blockchain for many.</v>

22
00:01:16.091 --> 00:01:16.924
<v Speaker 1>This crypto currency world is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ultimate revolution that's going to end </v>

23
00:01:20.201 --> 00:01:21.034
<v Speaker 1>governments and banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For others it's just another financial </v>

24
00:01:23.381 --> 00:01:24.214
<v Speaker 1>bubble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will make it easier for criminals </v>

25
00:01:25.181 --> 00:01:27.940
<v Speaker 1>and terrorists to hide their money from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the police.</v>

26
00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.863
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately the reality is way more </v>
<v Speaker 1>boring than this bitcoin exchange </v>

27
00:01:35.431 --> 00:01:36.264
<v Speaker 1>reaches deal with Barclays for UK </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions but all is on just a </v>

28
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.920
<v Speaker 1>second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you felt cryptic currencies,</v>

29
00:01:40.921 --> 00:01:44.370
<v Speaker 1>but just a strategy to avoid taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got some news for you.</v>

30
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.330
<v Speaker 2>This municipality</v>

31
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.810
<v Speaker 1>of [inaudible] is going to let residents</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay their taxes in bitcoin.</v>

32
00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:53.640
<v Speaker 1>It's mayor has announced,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sorry,</v>

33
00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.740
<v Speaker 1>let's start from the beginning.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shall We?</v>

34
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.040
<v Speaker 1>Blockchain?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blockchain is a technology.</v>

35
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 1>It just like virtual reality or peer to </v>
<v Speaker 1>peer file sharing is a technology.</v>

36
00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.150
<v Speaker 1>As with every technology you can use it </v>
<v Speaker 1>for any different things and one of them</v>

37
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.380
<v Speaker 1>is cryptocurrencies and one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrencies,</v>

38
00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.223
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin and as with many technologies </v>
<v Speaker 1>you can use it for many different </v>

39
00:02:16.231 --> 00:02:17.064
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of them is cryptocurrencies and one </v>

40
00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:22.620
<v Speaker 1>of those cryptocurrencies is bitcoin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But it's not the only one.</v>

41
00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:23.483
<v Speaker 1>Many people think that these new coins </v>
<v Speaker 1>will substitute legal money that is </v>

42
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:27.510
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>euros,</v>

43
00:02:27.511 --> 00:02:30.720
<v Speaker 1>or any other currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have to be that way.</v>

44
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.643
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrencies can do many other </v>

45
00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:35.400
<v Speaker 1>things and today we're going to have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>look at some of them.</v>

46
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.940
<v Speaker 1>But now the real question is what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockchain all about?</v>

47
00:02:38.941 --> 00:02:41.850
<v Speaker 1>What is it used for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And most importantly why,</v>

48
00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:43.920
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banks starting to use it.</v>

49
00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.990
<v Speaker 1>Do they were going to answer all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these questions,</v>

50
00:02:45.991 --> 00:02:48.210
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at their history.</v>

51
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.230
<v Speaker 1>What is blockchain used for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>

52
00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.170
<v Speaker 1>bitcoin was born in 2009 nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the technology that it's based on,</v>

53
00:02:58.171 --> 00:02:59.004
<v Speaker 1>the blockchain was all the way back in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1991 so let's see how it works without </v>

54
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.020
<v Speaker 1>even mentioning the word.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

55
00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.993
<v Speaker 2>Ahead.</v>

56
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:10.673
<v Speaker 1>Body.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to do this well because it's </v>

57
00:03:11.101 --> 00:03:14.490
<v Speaker 1>important to understand the blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>can be used for many other things.</v>

58
00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:17.320
<v Speaker 1>And since this is a complicated matter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I asked one sec,</v>

59
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.173
<v Speaker 1>one of the hosts of the Spanish visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic channel to show it to you by </v>

60
00:03:20.791 --> 00:03:23.840
<v Speaker 1>drawing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is something he can do and I sadly</v>

61
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.683
<v Speaker 1>cannot.</v>

62
00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:27.593
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me take you back to the example </v>

63
00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 1>of the house in San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one that costs one point $3 million.</v>

64
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v Speaker 1>In order to buy it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have to sign a contract with the </v>

65
00:03:34.511 --> 00:03:35.344
<v Speaker 1>owner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but how do you know that he or she is </v>

66
00:03:36.491 --> 00:03:39.640
<v Speaker 1>going to meet that agreement?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How do you know that the house exists if</v>

67
00:03:39.641 --> 00:03:41.860
<v Speaker 1>you've never seen it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In reality,</v>

68
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.820
<v Speaker 1>usually we have a trusted third party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like a notary verifiers.</v>

69
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.370
<v Speaker 1>This notary will verify the house </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

70
00:03:48.371 --> 00:03:49.204
<v Speaker 1>Since that you're talking to the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>owner who is willing to hand over the </v>

71
00:03:51.791 --> 00:03:52.624
<v Speaker 1>keys when he gets the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the way that any traditional </v>

72
00:03:55.181 --> 00:03:56.014
<v Speaker 1>contract works and it has many problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First having many parties means that </v>

73
00:04:02.851 --> 00:04:06.480
<v Speaker 1>there's lots of waiting time and lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>fees,</v>

74
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:10.380
<v Speaker 1>but there's an even worse problem here </v>
<v Speaker 1>if someone hacked the computer of one of</v>

75
00:04:10.381 --> 00:04:13.350
<v Speaker 1>those third parties so you could modify </v>
<v Speaker 1>the terms of the contract.</v>

76
00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.460
<v Speaker 1>This means traditional contracts on not </v>
<v Speaker 1>as safe as they seem,</v>

77
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.320
<v Speaker 1>and this is where the lock chain enters </v>
<v Speaker 1>the picture.</v>

78
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.170
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of using a traditional contract,</v>

79
00:04:23.171 --> 00:04:25.750
<v Speaker 1>we could use a so called smart contract.</v>

80
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.223
<v Speaker 1>Is that a little bit of software that </v>
<v Speaker 1>executes automatically when something </v>

81
00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:37.610
<v Speaker 1>happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

82
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:40.670
<v Speaker 1>you could leave your one point $3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million in a special account.</v>

83
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:44.570
<v Speaker 1>So there's the moment when you open up a</v>
<v Speaker 1>new door of your house as sensible,</v>

84
00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.433
<v Speaker 1>notice your presence and boom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the smart contract will take your 1.3 </v>

85
00:04:48.651 --> 00:04:49.484
<v Speaker 1>million bucks from that special accounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and send it to the seller in case the </v>

86
00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:54.440
<v Speaker 1>key doesn't work because you've been </v>
<v Speaker 1>tricked,</v>

87
00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:57.260
<v Speaker 1>then the contract would not execute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

88
00:04:57.261 --> 00:04:58.094
<v Speaker 1>so all of this sounds pretty great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but who is going to validate any of </v>

89
00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:02.210
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:03.043
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't actually need that parties or </v>

91
00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:05.903
<v Speaker 1>middlemen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's may need for notaries </v>

92
00:05:07.011 --> 00:05:08.420
<v Speaker 1>whatsoever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

93
00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.070
<v Speaker 1>we have a network.</v>

94
00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.523
<v Speaker 1>This is a crappy is a company that </v>
<v Speaker 1>offers a real estate sales </v>

95
00:05:17.571 --> 00:05:19.610
<v Speaker 1>internationally through blockchain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:05:19.611 --> 00:05:20.444
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the sellers and buyers inside of </v>

97
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:24.950
<v Speaker 1>this platform would be nodes of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>network.</v>

98
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:25.873
<v Speaker 1>And so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I just want to address it really </v>

99
00:05:27.081 --> 00:05:30.050
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No company has paid us to do this video.</v>

100
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:31.940
<v Speaker 1>We just used the example of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

101
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:32.774
<v Speaker 1>So we can give a real life example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It makes it more tangible and hopefully </v>

102
00:05:35.271 --> 00:05:36.104
<v Speaker 1>more enjoyable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So while the great innovation of </v>

103
00:05:37.521 --> 00:05:41.270
<v Speaker 1>blockchain is that it's users will </v>
<v Speaker 1>always have a copy of the contract.</v>

104
00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.610
<v Speaker 1>So all of them can be a point of </v>
<v Speaker 1>verification.</v>

105
00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:47.870
<v Speaker 1>And in case one copy does not match the </v>
<v Speaker 1>copy of another node system,</v>

106
00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:50.330
<v Speaker 1>we'll consider this to be fought.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>

107
00:05:50.331 --> 00:05:51.164
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this contract will always be stored and </v>

108
00:05:53.981 --> 00:05:55.270
<v Speaker 1>what we call a block.</v>

109
00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.373
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

110
00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:02.920
<v Speaker 1>And this book at the same time will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>stored in a chain of blocks.</v>

111
00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.830
<v Speaker 1>This is why we call this system </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockchain.</v>

112
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.560
<v Speaker 1>So if a hacker wants to modify our </v>
<v Speaker 1>contract,</v>

113
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:09.483
<v Speaker 1>he would have to get into all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>computers from the members of our </v>

114
00:06:12.461 --> 00:06:15.160
<v Speaker 1>blockchain all at the same time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

115
00:06:15.161 --> 00:06:15.994
<v Speaker 1>this is way harder than getting into one</v>
<v Speaker 1>computer and no matter how secure that </v>

116
00:06:19.571 --> 00:06:21.310
<v Speaker 1>computer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you might be wondering,</v>

117
00:06:21.311 --> 00:06:24.430
<v Speaker 1>so anytime I start using some blockchain</v>
<v Speaker 1>service,</v>

118
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:25.293
<v Speaker 1>will they have all the registers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions that have been done in </v>

119
00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.160
<v Speaker 1>Sinus?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is,</v>

120
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:31.120
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

121
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:33.100
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to have a bitcoin,</v>

122
00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.620
<v Speaker 1>you should download all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>blockchain,</v>

123
00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.860
<v Speaker 1>which is now over 160 gigabytes</v>

124
00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.980
<v Speaker 1>and now I can get many of you saying,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well come on sign.</v>

125
00:06:45.981 --> 00:06:48.140
<v Speaker 1>And that's not true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I've got a bit coin while there's a nice</v>

126
00:06:48.141 --> 00:06:50.970
<v Speaker 1>enough to download 160 gigabytes or </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

127
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:54.630
<v Speaker 1>Well actually of course you do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In your case for you or what you have is</v>

128
00:06:54.631 --> 00:06:55.464
<v Speaker 1>actually a light coin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that another person </v>

129
00:06:57.091 --> 00:06:57.924
<v Speaker 1>downloaded those 160 gigabytes and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person is letting you use bitcoin </v>

130
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.470
<v Speaker 1>through his or has server.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This said,</v>

131
00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:05.363
<v Speaker 1>blockchain is starting to be used for </v>
<v Speaker 1>all kinds of things as you have already </v>

132
00:07:08.431 --> 00:07:09.264
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some companies offer real estate deals </v>

133
00:07:10.771 --> 00:07:13.110
<v Speaker 1>with smart contracts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are many,</v>

134
00:07:13.111 --> 00:07:16.290
<v Speaker 1>many other applications.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can even have a website hosting with</v>

135
00:07:16.291 --> 00:07:17.124
<v Speaker 1>blockchain so then he can hear it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>US inside of a network would have the </v>

136
00:07:19.651 --> 00:07:20.484
<v Speaker 1>data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>other companies offer medical record </v>

137
00:07:21.811 --> 00:07:23.100
<v Speaker 1>storage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

138
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.600
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

139
00:07:24.601 --> 00:07:27.840
<v Speaker 1>we've already told you what blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>is all about.</v>

140
00:07:27.870 --> 00:07:28.703
<v Speaker 1>Now there is a second part and that is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well what do banks have to do with all </v>

141
00:07:32.821 --> 00:07:34.670
<v Speaker 1>of this and that's something we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to look at,</v>

142
00:07:34.710 --> 00:07:35.543
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

143
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:40.030
<v Speaker 2>Survival</v>

144
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:42.640
<v Speaker 1>of the fittest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is one thing that generates all</v>

145
00:07:42.641 --> 00:07:47.440
<v Speaker 1>kinds of gossip and mixed signals and </v>
<v Speaker 1>conspiracy theories,</v>

146
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:48.303
<v Speaker 1>it's crypto currencies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You just need to google the name of any </v>

147
00:07:50.651 --> 00:07:51.484
<v Speaker 1>famous company followed by the word </v>
<v Speaker 1>crypto currency and you've got some </v>

148
00:07:53.921 --> 00:07:54.754
<v Speaker 1>blogs that claims that this farm wants </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get its own crypto coin or the </v>

149
00:07:57.341 --> 00:07:59.620
<v Speaker 1>opposite or both things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>

150
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:00.783
<v Speaker 1>there's information.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Noise is so pervasive that it is almost </v>

151
00:08:03.371 --> 00:08:04.204
<v Speaker 1>impossible to separate the wheat from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the chaff and this is also a heads up </v>

152
00:08:07.541 --> 00:08:09.850
<v Speaker 1>for you guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might want to start investing in this</v>

153
00:08:09.851 --> 00:08:11.050
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Watch out.</v>

154
00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:12.520
<v Speaker 1>I'm not telling you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not to you,</v>

155
00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:16.720
<v Speaker 1>but be careful because there is a lot of</v>
<v Speaker 1>hype and this is why to do this video.</v>

156
00:08:16.721 --> 00:08:17.554
<v Speaker 1>We talked straight to the sources so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we could corroborate that this is </v>

157
00:08:21.191 --> 00:08:24.640
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dbva an intro.</v>

158
00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:27.730
<v Speaker 1>We'll make the world's first blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>based corporate loan.</v>

159
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:28.653
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indra is a Spanish engineering company </v>

160
00:08:30.551 --> 00:08:31.384
<v Speaker 1>and bb Va is a large Spanish bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea is pretty similar to what we </v>

161
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:35.494
<v Speaker 1>said about the house in San Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 1>and this case bb va signs a contract </v>

162
00:08:39.101 --> 00:08:39.934
<v Speaker 1>with Indra and to all the members inside</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the blockchain will have a copy of </v>

163
00:08:43.481 --> 00:08:46.600
<v Speaker 1>the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the advantage of all this?</v>

164
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:48.760
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would prevent internal corruption.</v>

165
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.623
<v Speaker 1>Some people might want to exaggerate the</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost of some building in order to get </v>

166
00:08:52.271 --> 00:08:53.104
<v Speaker 1>her money into their pockets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if they have a smart and everybody </v>

167
00:08:56.491 --> 00:09:00.240
<v Speaker 1>has a copy of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then they can track every transaction.</v>

168
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:01.163
<v Speaker 1>This means that both the company and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>bank are protecting themselves from the </v>

169
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:05.063
<v Speaker 1>iron workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we are only talking about loans </v>

170
00:09:07.471 --> 00:09:08.580
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said before,</v>

171
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:12.870
<v Speaker 1>blockchain can be used for many other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things and apparently Spanish banks,</v>

172
00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:15.210
<v Speaker 1>they want to pioneer this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another example.</v>

173
00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:19.540
<v Speaker 2>Sorry</v>

174
00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:22.000
<v Speaker 3>Tom Dare to launch the first blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 3>base.</v>

175
00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:24.160
<v Speaker 3>International money transfer service.</v>

176
00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:28.510
<v Speaker 1>In this case we are talking again about </v>
<v Speaker 1>a reducing verification times.</v>

177
00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:31.510
<v Speaker 1>You see anytime you make an </v>
<v Speaker 1>international money transfer,</v>

178
00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:34.300
<v Speaker 1>you have lots of intermediary banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

179
00:09:34.301 --> 00:09:35.134
<v Speaker 1>if you want to send $1,000 to a friend </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Germany or somebody has to verify </v>

180
00:09:37.811 --> 00:09:42.811
<v Speaker 1>that you have $1,000 less and your </v>
<v Speaker 1>friend has $1,000 more after this,</v>

181
00:09:43.211 --> 00:09:46.960
<v Speaker 1>the problems from the currency exchange </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you have lots of intermediaries that</v>

182
00:09:46.961 --> 00:09:51.130
<v Speaker 1>need to be in contact and verify every </v>
<v Speaker 1>step of the process.</v>

183
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:53.530
<v Speaker 1>Companies like a ripple used blockchain </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do this.</v>

184
00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:54.453
<v Speaker 1>In a matter of seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why it Santown death will </v>

185
00:09:56.921 --> 00:10:00.570
<v Speaker 1>now stop making international transfers </v>
<v Speaker 1>from one day to the other.</v>

186
00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:01.643
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>both Santander and bb va has been </v>

187
00:10:03.601 --> 00:10:06.090
<v Speaker 3>investing in cryptocurrency companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>for years.</v>

188
00:10:10.290 --> 00:10:11.123
<v Speaker 3>Main European banks have all been part </v>
<v Speaker 3>of blockchain platforms for years from </v>

189
00:10:14.781 --> 00:10:15.614
<v Speaker 3>we trade to the Spanish Alaska area.</v>
<v Speaker 3>But how big of future do these projects </v>

190
00:10:18.891 --> 00:10:20.660
<v Speaker 3>have?</v>
<v Speaker 3>You simply don't know,</v>

191
00:10:20.810 --> 00:10:21.643
<v Speaker 3>but clearly there's an interest from </v>
<v Speaker 3>traditional banks to not miss out on </v>

192
00:10:24.711 --> 00:10:26.450
<v Speaker 3>these kinds of new technologies.</v>

193
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:27.860
<v Speaker 1>And now I know what you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

194
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:31.580
<v Speaker 1>So far we've just talked about faster </v>
<v Speaker 1>transactions and safe a contract.</v>

195
00:10:31.581 --> 00:10:33.290
<v Speaker 1>It's nothing super exciting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

196
00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.010
<v Speaker 1>So where is that revolution that some </v>
<v Speaker 1>people are talking about?</v>

197
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:38.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>believe me,</v>

198
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.610
<v Speaker 1>there is certainly a potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution here,</v>

199
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:42.890
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about that in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the coming week.</v>

200
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:46.373
<v Speaker 2>Send me</v>

204
00:10:55.381 --> 00:10:58.140
<v Speaker 1>blockchain technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What about cryptocurrencies?</v>

205
00:10:58.260 --> 00:10:59.280
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Bitcoin,</v>

208

<v Speaker 1>but will they use it as a normal thing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

209
00:11:05.191 --> 00:11:08.610
<v Speaker 1>we see all kinds of new services,</v>
