1
00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.230
<v Speaker 1>There's no secret the great us </v>
<v Speaker 1>locomotive is working at full speed.</v>

2
00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.370
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

3
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.790
<v Speaker 1>Ten years of uninterrupted growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The North American economy is enjoying a</v>

4
00:00:26.791 --> 00:00:29.550
<v Speaker 1>wonderful moments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You had employment rate lines below four</v>

5
00:00:29.551 --> 00:00:34.260
<v Speaker 1>percent is lowest level since the year </v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 and every month more than a 100,000</v>

6
00:00:34.261 --> 00:00:39.261
<v Speaker 1>new jobs are created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Salaries are also growing,</v>

7
00:00:39.381 --> 00:00:43.220
<v Speaker 1>and then the last three years alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 8 million jobs have been created.</v>

8
00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial production and exports are at</v>

9
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.860
<v Speaker 1>historically high levels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even in spite of their last stumbled,</v>

10
00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:52.940
<v Speaker 1>the SNP 500 has exploded in recent </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

11
00:00:52.941 --> 00:00:53.774
<v Speaker 1>The locomotive is absolutely soaring it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second because the US </v>

12
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:02.504
<v Speaker 1>economy has another face and it's a face</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've already spoken about here on </v>

13
00:01:05.241 --> 00:01:10.241
<v Speaker 1>visual politic debut is the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

14
00:01:14.581 --> 00:01:19.170
<v Speaker 1>especially the government is addicted to</v>
<v Speaker 1>credit and debt that right.</v>

15
00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.153
<v Speaker 1>You're saying September the 30th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 marks the end of the federal </v>

16
00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:24.840
<v Speaker 1>government's budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

17
00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:25.763
<v Speaker 1>And here's a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can you tell me how much the federal </v>

18
00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:33.801
<v Speaker 1>debt increased by in this year alone?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually it's about $40,000</v>

19
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.243
<v Speaker 1>or what's your.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The onset is no less than one point </v>

20
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.740
<v Speaker 1>$3,000,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This amount surpasses the entire Mexican</v>

21
00:01:51.871 --> 00:01:52.700
<v Speaker 1>GDP.</v>

22
00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.900
<v Speaker 3>We are living on borrowed money,</v>
<v Speaker 3>borrowed time,</v>

23
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.780
<v Speaker 3>these hike interest rates,</v>
<v Speaker 3>clobber exports,</v>

24
00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.820
<v Speaker 3>stumped,</v>
<v Speaker 3>investment,</v>

25
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.790
<v Speaker 3>killed jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 3>undermine growth.</v>

26
00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.293
<v Speaker 3>She our kit and shrink our future.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's time to ask why it is that we have </v>

27
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:17.684
<v Speaker 3>run up more debt in this country in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last eight years than we did in the </v>

28
00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.240
<v Speaker 3>previous 200 and to make sure it never </v>
<v Speaker 3>happens again.</v>

29
00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.730
<v Speaker 2>I'm</v>

30
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.470
<v Speaker 1>worried about the federal government </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

31
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:36.333
<v Speaker 1>The economy is growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the public deficit is out of </v>

32
00:02:38.351 --> 00:02:39.490
<v Speaker 1>control.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

33
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>just in the last year with Donald trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the White House,</v>

34
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.093
<v Speaker 1>government spending grew by seven </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and it looks like things are </v>

35
00:02:45.611 --> 00:02:47.410
<v Speaker 1>going to get worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much worse.</v>

36
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:48.303
<v Speaker 1>Congress' budget office estimates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>if they stay on this path in less than </v>

37
00:02:51.851 --> 00:02:52.684
<v Speaker 1>10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interest payments alone will cost the </v>

38
00:02:54.551 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 1>federal governments more than $900,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars every single year.</v>

39
00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:00.183
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the federal government isn't the only </v>

40
00:03:01.331 --> 00:03:03.280
<v Speaker 1>debt junkie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this,</v>

41
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.960
<v Speaker 1>the states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the hidden debt let me grow as an income</v>

42
00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.273
<v Speaker 1>in 2017.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty nine of the 50 states that make </v>

43
00:03:19.501 --> 00:03:20.334
<v Speaker 1>up the United States had surpluses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is they made more money than they </v>

44
00:03:23.761 --> 00:03:24.594
<v Speaker 1>spent.</v>

45
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:26.103
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

46
00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.610
<v Speaker 1>Years of adjusting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

47
00:03:27.611 --> 00:03:30.160
<v Speaker 1>the question that many governors are </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking themselves is,</v>

48
00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.680
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the best way to spend all of this</v>

49
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:37.681
<v Speaker 1>money?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>

50
00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.593
<v Speaker 1>since 2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every state's collection has increased </v>

51
00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:43.910
<v Speaker 1>by 40 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we're really not talking about just a</v>

52
00:03:43.911 --> 00:03:45.320
<v Speaker 1>few cents out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>

53
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.810
<v Speaker 1>states have resources to invest in </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure,</v>

54
00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:49.600
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social services,</v>

55
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.503
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then this might all sound pretty good </v>

56
00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:53.030
<v Speaker 1>rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.150
<v Speaker 1>sadly The truth is a little different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

58
00:03:56.151 --> 00:04:01.151
<v Speaker 1>it's actually quite a lot different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

59
00:04:01.871 --> 00:04:02.704
<v Speaker 1>in principle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every state except for Vermont has to </v>

60
00:04:04.961 --> 00:04:06.880
<v Speaker 1>have a balanced budget.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

61
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:10.330
<v Speaker 1>despite this and all the parents </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced surpluses,</v>

62
00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:15.360
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that all of the states </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't stop accumulating debt obligations</v>

63
00:04:15.401 --> 00:04:17.590
<v Speaker 1>and liabilities of all kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

64
00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.280
<v Speaker 1>nowadays every stage drags according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the think tank.</v>

65
00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:21.123
<v Speaker 1>Truth and accounting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A heavy load of more than one point 5 </v>

66
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:29.370
<v Speaker 1>trillion in unfunded debt is that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>vast majority,</v>

67
00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.933
<v Speaker 1>no less than 40 of the 50 states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have the resources to face all of </v>

68
00:04:34.911 --> 00:04:36.830
<v Speaker 1>the commitments that they've gotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves into.</v>

69
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:38.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

70
00:04:38.181 --> 00:04:39.014
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because how the hell can states </v>

71
00:04:39.561 --> 00:04:42.350
<v Speaker 1>accumulate desk while their budgets are </v>
<v Speaker 1>balanced?</v>

72
00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:43.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically by doing all kinds of </v>

73
00:04:44.811 --> 00:04:45.644
<v Speaker 1>accounting tricks after old politicians </v>
<v Speaker 1>and elected officials are most </v>

74
00:04:48.621 --> 00:04:52.370
<v Speaker 1>interested in masking that figures and </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending every penny.</v>

75
00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.120
<v Speaker 1>I mean if we're honest about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is kind of how elections are won.</v>

76
00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.290
<v Speaker 1>Did they say they use many tricks from </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflating income assumptions?</v>

77
00:05:03.291 --> 00:05:04.124
<v Speaker 1>do you delaying bill payments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the most important trick of all is </v>

78
00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.173
<v Speaker 1>one that has to do with pensions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits for public employees when they </v>

79
00:05:11.871 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 1>retire.</v>

80
00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.083
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

81
00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:14.683
<v Speaker 1>AlloW me to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to gain votes and get along </v>

82
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:17.324
<v Speaker 1>with union state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>governments tend to promise public </v>

83
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:19.694
<v Speaker 1>employees very good pensions as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of additional benefits of paul </v>

84
00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:22.980
<v Speaker 1>never time</v>

85
00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:23.813
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

86
00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>Given how the pension system works in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

87
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:28.564
<v Speaker 1>this assumes that each month state </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments have to contribute to the </v>

88
00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:33.070
<v Speaker 1>amounts they committed to to a pension </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund,</v>

89
00:05:33.071 --> 00:05:35.710
<v Speaker 1>so there's tomorrow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>all those public workers can collect the</v>

90
00:05:35.711 --> 00:05:36.610
<v Speaker 1>pensions that they were.</v>

91
00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:40.160
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

92
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.993
<v Speaker 1>just for a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's put ourselves in the place of the </v>

93
00:05:42.831 --> 00:05:45.470
<v Speaker 1>politicians in charge of the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

94
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:48.440
<v Speaker 1>What if instead of depositing all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>money into a pension funds,</v>

95
00:05:48.441 --> 00:05:51.230
<v Speaker 1>we invest in all kinds of public </v>
<v Speaker 1>spending programs.</v>

96
00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:54.630
<v Speaker 1>That way we can finance and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects which will make us win lots of.</v>

97
00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.431
<v Speaker 1>Oops,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay,</v>

98
00:05:55.431 --> 00:05:57.190
<v Speaker 1>so some of you mIght now be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

99
00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.700
<v Speaker 1>all of you are probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

100
00:05:58.701 --> 00:05:59.534
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen to all of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>employees when they start retiring and </v>

101
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.650
<v Speaker 1>claiming those pensions and those </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits?</v>

102
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:04.513
<v Speaker 1>The how are they going to be paid?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the answer is it doesn't really </v>

103
00:06:06.531 --> 00:06:07.364
<v Speaker 1>matter it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember you're a politician that's </v>

104
00:06:08.331 --> 00:06:10.880
<v Speaker 1>going to be someone else's problem way </v>
<v Speaker 1>down the line.</v>

105
00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:13.580
<v Speaker 1>You just need to worry about winning the</v>
<v Speaker 1>next election.</v>

106
00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:14.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

107
00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.103
<v Speaker 1>according to the data it really looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like that is actually the thought that </v>

108
00:06:18.171 --> 00:06:22.760
<v Speaker 1>many state politicians have.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hat state and local governments made big</v>

109
00:06:22.761 --> 00:06:23.594
<v Speaker 1>commitments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly on pensions and retiree </v>

110
00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:26.453
<v Speaker 1>healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but didn't adequately fund those </v>

111
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:29.810
<v Speaker 1>liabilities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr.</v>

112
00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:30.643
<v Speaker 1>Brennan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a democrat and mayor of hartford in </v>

113
00:06:32.401 --> 00:06:35.120
<v Speaker 1>total only regarding unfunded state </v>
<v Speaker 1>pensions,</v>

114
00:06:35.121 --> 00:06:38.480
<v Speaker 1>the state debts already exceed </v>
<v Speaker 1>$800,000,000,000.</v>

115
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.343
<v Speaker 1>The big question is knowing how the hell</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to be able to cope with </v>

116
00:06:42.111 --> 00:06:42.944
<v Speaker 1>this huge amounts of debt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course not every state is the </v>

117
00:06:45.771 --> 00:06:47.090
<v Speaker 1>same,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so listen up</v>

118
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:59.210
<v Speaker 1>best and worst.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we think about it for a moment,</v>

119
00:06:59.401 --> 00:07:03.600
<v Speaker 1>it's easY to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Politicians have a gigantic incentive to</v>

120
00:07:03.601 --> 00:07:04.434
<v Speaker 1>spend every last penny after all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire future depends on the next </v>

121
00:07:08.611 --> 00:07:11.170
<v Speaker 1>election cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why it's so important.</v>

122
00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:12.023
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's absolutely essential to not only </v>

123
00:07:13.501 --> 00:07:14.334
<v Speaker 1>have counterweights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for civil society to be </v>

124
00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:17.213
<v Speaker 1>attentive and very demanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to the case of the </v>

125
00:07:20.251 --> 00:07:25.251
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we've seen,</v>

126
00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:32.910
<v Speaker 1>they aren't dragging a colossal unfunded</v>
<v Speaker 1>debt of one point $5,000,000,000,000.</v>

127
00:07:32.940 --> 00:07:33.773
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not every state is in the same </v>

128
00:07:34.501 --> 00:07:36.930
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Out of the countries 50 states,</v>

129
00:07:36.931 --> 00:07:37.764
<v Speaker 1>at least 40,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have enough assets today to face </v>

130
00:07:39.810 --> 00:07:41.520
<v Speaker 1>all of their obligations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

131
00:07:41.521 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 1>though some states are better off than </v>
<v Speaker 1>others.</v>

132
00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:44.553
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are 10 states where politicians </v>

133
00:07:46.501 --> 00:07:47.334
<v Speaker 1>have been responsible enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee their state's future and keep </v>

134
00:07:50.071 --> 00:07:54.100
<v Speaker 1>their accounts in order.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:07:54.101 --> 00:07:54.934
<v Speaker 1>these are the 10 states that really did </v>
<v Speaker 1>their homework and we think they've </v>

136
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.140
<v Speaker 1>earned the right to actually get a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mention.</v>

137
00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:00.790
<v Speaker 1>It would be Alaska,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Dakota,</v>

138
00:08:00.791 --> 00:08:01.601
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Utah,</v>

139
00:08:01.601 --> 00:08:02.800
<v Speaker 1>South Dakota,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Idaho,</v>

140
00:08:02.801 --> 00:08:04.210
<v Speaker 1>Tennessee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nebraska,</v>

141
00:08:04.390 --> 00:08:05.800
<v Speaker 1>Oregon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Iowa.</v>

142
00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:09.730
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all of them,</v>

143
00:08:09.731 --> 00:08:10.564
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of Oregon and Iowa </v>
<v Speaker 1>are strongly republican states and </v>

144
00:08:14.230 --> 00:08:15.970
<v Speaker 1>democrats should really start looking at</v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

145
00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:16.990
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

146
00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:25.620
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that all the other states </v>
<v Speaker 1>currently haVe a negative balance,</v>

147
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.513
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to get a better idea of what we're </v>

148
00:08:27.031 --> 00:08:29.430
<v Speaker 1>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look a the following graph.</v>

149
00:08:29.431 --> 00:08:32.220
<v Speaker 1>This shows the top five and bottom five </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

150
00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.020
<v Speaker 1>Data is expressed in dollars per </v>
<v Speaker 1>taxpayer and yep,</v>

151
00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.500
<v Speaker 1>you are looking at it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While states such as North Dakota,</v>

152
00:08:44.501 --> 00:08:45.640
<v Speaker 1>Wyoming,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Iowa,</v>

153
00:08:45.641 --> 00:08:46.474
<v Speaker 1>I've been responsible and have </v>
<v Speaker 1>accumulated enough savings to meet all </v>

154
00:08:48.731 --> 00:08:49.564
<v Speaker 1>of their obligations and even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>surpluses to invest in benefit each </v>

155
00:08:52.781 --> 00:08:53.670
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois,</v>

156
00:08:53.710 --> 00:08:54.543
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and New Jersey dragging a terrifying </v>

157
00:08:56.671 --> 00:09:00.020
<v Speaker 1>load of more than $58,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>per taxpayer.</v>

158
00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.270
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

159
00:09:04.271 --> 00:09:05.190
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

160
00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:06.050
<v Speaker 1>how enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

161
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:09.220
<v Speaker 1>all the states going to be able to cover</v>
<v Speaker 1>their obligations.</v>

162
00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:10.083
<v Speaker 1>The answer isn't simple because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation of some states as we saw in </v>

163
00:09:12.881 --> 00:09:15.970
<v Speaker 1>the case of Illinois,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut and New Jersey is so bad,</v>

164
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:21.000
<v Speaker 1>but finding a solution is really hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

165
00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:27.783
<v Speaker 1>In new jesse's case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wHich is the worst off of all the </v>

166
00:09:29.671 --> 00:09:30.504
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fiscal hold amounts to almost </v>

167
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:34.650
<v Speaker 1>$200,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say this whole,</v>

168
00:09:34.651 --> 00:09:38.010
<v Speaker 1>which belongs to a state that has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>little over 9 million inhabitants,</v>

169
00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:38.873
<v Speaker 1>is larger than the economy of Qatar and </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost as big as the economies of </v>

170
00:09:42.811 --> 00:09:46.770
<v Speaker 1>countries like New Zealand or Peru.</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty damn crazy.</v>

171
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.270
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what we can say is that ultimately there</v>

172
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:54.520
<v Speaker 1>are only two possible ways to solve </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

173
00:09:54.580 --> 00:09:57.220
<v Speaker 1>Either they raise taxes or cut spending.</v>

174
00:09:59.310 --> 00:10:00.143
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that raising taxes may </v>
<v Speaker 1>not even be an option because it can </v>

175
00:10:02.911 --> 00:10:06.020
<v Speaker 1>damage the state's economic potential </v>
<v Speaker 1>and drive away taxpayers,</v>

176
00:10:06.030 --> 00:10:08.100
<v Speaker 1>especially those who have large </v>
<v Speaker 1>fortunes.</v>

177
00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:08.993
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut where in recent years a lot </v>

178
00:10:11.191 --> 00:10:12.024
<v Speaker 1>of big businessmen have fled the state </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of high taxes in comparison to </v>

179
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:20.240
<v Speaker 1>other territories within the us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it wasn't only Connecticut in 2016,</v>

180
00:10:22.891 --> 00:10:25.740
<v Speaker 1>the last year for which we have data.</v>
<v Speaker 1>600,000</v>

181
00:10:25.741 --> 00:10:30.741
<v Speaker 1>people moved from the 25 states with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest access to the 25 states with the</v>

182
00:10:31.021 --> 00:10:31.854
<v Speaker 1>lowest taxes and also donald trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest fiscal reform at really looks as </v>

183
00:10:37.321 --> 00:10:41.010
<v Speaker 1>if this process is going to speed up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to talk</v>

184
00:10:41.011 --> 00:10:41.844
<v Speaker 1>about in a future video so far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can see that the debt addiction is </v>

185
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>far from being an elusive federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>government problem.</v>

186
00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.230
<v Speaker 1>The us economy is going strong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is the other side of the coin.</v>

187
00:10:55.030 --> 00:10:58.580
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that for the country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth to remain sustainable,</v>

188
00:10:58.660 --> 00:10:59.493
<v Speaker 1>both the federal government and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>state governments need to finally start </v>

189
00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:06.430
<v Speaker 1>taking the whole deficits and public </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt issue very seriously.</v>

190
00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:07.353
<v Speaker 1>It is not normal for a country with such</v>
<v Speaker 1>a high amount of growth to have assumed </v>

191
00:11:10.470 --> 00:11:14.550
<v Speaker 1>many public accounting balances and this</v>
<v Speaker 1>leads to big questions like what's going</v>

192
00:11:14.551 --> 00:11:17.980
<v Speaker 1>to happen when it all goes wrong and </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the limit to having so much debt?</v>

193
00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.480
<v Speaker 1>Because folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's not forget,</v>

194
00:11:19.481 --> 00:11:24.481
<v Speaker 1>sooner or later in one way or another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public debt always has to be paid.</v>
