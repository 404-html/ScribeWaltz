1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.110
<v Speaker 1>We've already discussed it here on </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic margin.</v>

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.770
<v Speaker 1>Tina is a country where football is </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically a state religion ends.</v>

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.623
<v Speaker 1>We're not a single decade goes by </v>
<v Speaker 1>without at least one major economic </v>

4
00:00:10.111 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For decades,</v>

5
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.920
<v Speaker 1>this country has been dominated by a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political model,</v>

6
00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:17.310
<v Speaker 1>a kind of ideology,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political current parent ism,</v>

7
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.890
<v Speaker 1>which is something like a mix of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nationalism,</v>

8
00:00:19.891 --> 00:00:21.990
<v Speaker 1>protectionism and public spending.</v>

9
00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.870
<v Speaker 2>Lab another job</v>

10
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:37.263
<v Speaker 1>in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you governments arrived that have </v>

11
00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:40.044
<v Speaker 1>Mauricio Macri with the mission of </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebuilding the country from the top to </v>

12
00:00:43.411 --> 00:00:44.244
<v Speaker 1>the bottom.</v>

13
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.660
<v Speaker 2>Joel the same vineyard go there</v>

14
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.183
<v Speaker 1>in the 2017 legislative elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Argentine people renewed that trust </v>

15
00:01:04.881 --> 00:01:07.010
<v Speaker 1>in this process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically they came to say,</v>

16
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well done mackery.</v>

17
00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.270
<v Speaker 1>So the question that has recently arisen</v>
<v Speaker 1>is,</v>

18
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.104
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ms Dot Argentina finally ready once and </v>

19
00:01:13.941 --> 00:01:15.650
<v Speaker 1>for all for takeoff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

20
00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.970
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shall We?</v>

21
00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:26.243
<v Speaker 1>On October the 22nd 2017 elections for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress and the senators were held in </v>

22
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.774
<v Speaker 1>Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government in coalition can be a </v>

23
00:01:32.361 --> 00:01:33.194
<v Speaker 1>moss,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has an overwhelming triumph with more </v>

24
00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:36.144
<v Speaker 1>than 10 million votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They won 15 out of the 24 electoral </v>

25
00:01:39.241 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>districts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the top five.</v>

26
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.220
<v Speaker 1>These are the most populated one spinal </v>
<v Speaker 1>surgeries,</v>

27
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:44.730
<v Speaker 1>providence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Buenos Aires city,</v>

28
00:01:44.731 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Cordoba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Santa Fe,</v>

29
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.973
<v Speaker 1>and Mendoza.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like that hasn't happened </v>

30
00:01:48.781 --> 00:01:50.340
<v Speaker 1>since 1985</v>

31
00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:51.243
<v Speaker 3>right</v>

32
00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.170
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after these elections.</v>

33
00:01:59.171 --> 00:02:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Can Gay is close to having an absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority,</v>

34
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>which ensures the government's ability </v>
<v Speaker 1>to push their reform agenda forward.</v>

35
00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.490
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>

36
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.833
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several analysts have stated that this </v>

37
00:02:23.191 --> 00:02:26.580
<v Speaker 1>is the true beginning of term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so after two years of power,</v>

38
00:02:26.581 --> 00:02:28.290
<v Speaker 1>what does mackery done?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What hasn't been done,</v>

39
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.153
<v Speaker 1>and what are his intentions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to find the answers to all </v>

40
00:02:31.471 --> 00:02:33.930
<v Speaker 1>of these questions in today's video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do that,</v>

41
00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.430
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history</v>

42
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.270
<v Speaker 3>downfall.</v>

43
00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:46.463
<v Speaker 1>Trigo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina was one of the richest </v>

44
00:02:47.711 --> 00:02:50.710
<v Speaker 1>countries in the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even richer than countries like Canada,</v>

45
00:02:50.711 --> 00:02:51.730
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>

46
00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:52.180
<v Speaker 1>or even</v>

47
00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.013
<v Speaker 3>Gemini.</v>

48
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.920
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when World War Two ended in 1945,</v>

49
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.190
<v Speaker 1>this country was along with the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

50
00:03:00.191 --> 00:03:02.470
<v Speaker 1>one of the largest creditors in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

51
00:03:02.471 --> 00:03:03.304
<v Speaker 1>and also one of the largest gold owners </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the entire planet at that time when </v>

52
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:08.764
<v Speaker 1>our salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Argentine capital was in full swing </v>

53
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.890
<v Speaker 1>and could even rival New York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course having said all of that,</v>

54
00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:16.090
<v Speaker 1>while he might not be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

55
00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:16.924
<v Speaker 1>what the hell happened to Argentina?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though things didn't look bad for </v>

56
00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:27.054
<v Speaker 1>this country after the Second World War?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that something that was </v>

57
00:03:29.461 --> 00:03:30.294
<v Speaker 1>already changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Great International Crisis of the 19 </v>

58
00:03:34.801 --> 00:03:37.770
<v Speaker 1>thirties affected this country a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

59
00:03:37.771 --> 00:03:38.604
<v Speaker 1>which was a huge agricultural exporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffers and just had its first major </v>

60
00:03:42.391 --> 00:03:45.180
<v Speaker 1>financial crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since that time,</v>

61
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.580
<v Speaker 1>all those years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing has been the same.</v>

62
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:55.480
<v Speaker 1>Six began to intervene in every economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and societal feels.</v>

63
00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.950
<v Speaker 1>Finally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1946,</v>

64
00:03:56.951 --> 00:04:00.010
<v Speaker 1>what we could call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the definitive term where it began,</v>

65
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:03.190
<v Speaker 1>the governments of General Ferrell first</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then Ken or Juan Domingo,</v>

66
00:04:03.191 --> 00:04:07.270
<v Speaker 1>Peron approved all kinds of rules and </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws more than 16,000</v>

67
00:04:07.271 --> 00:04:08.104
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which puts the economy under state </v>

68
00:04:09.731 --> 00:04:14.731
<v Speaker 1>control,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which for example meant that things like</v>

69
00:04:16.691 --> 00:04:19.360
<v Speaker 1>foreign trade isn't as creation or </v>
<v Speaker 1>competition,</v>

70
00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.620
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't really be a priority instead of</v>
<v Speaker 1>policies such as import substitution,</v>

71
00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.650
<v Speaker 1>nationalization ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>launched state enterprises.</v>

72
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.000
<v Speaker 1>They became the order of the day.</v>

73
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.083
<v Speaker 1>This is how a 70 year downfall began,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which made Argentina become one of the </v>

74
00:04:36.661 --> 00:04:37.494
<v Speaker 1>very few countries that has gone from a </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed country to a developing </v>

75
00:04:40.591 --> 00:04:41.424
<v Speaker 1>country economic crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hyperinflation and payments suspension </v>

76
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:46.100
<v Speaker 1>has become very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very common problems.</v>

77
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.350
<v Speaker 1>Talked about in the Argentinian media in</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent decades,</v>

78
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:50.213
<v Speaker 1>and this process culminated with </v>
<v Speaker 1>coaching tourism from Christina </v>

79
00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.460
<v Speaker 1>Fernandez to cut snap man to ruin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tell two terms.</v>

80
00:05:10.061 --> 00:05:10.894
<v Speaker 1>As president and Cristina Fernandez de </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] set up a model that could </v>

81
00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:16.120
<v Speaker 1>simply be defined as uneconomical.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

82
00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.013
<v Speaker 1>Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was already pretty terrible at </v>

83
00:05:18.191 --> 00:05:19.480
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but Christina,</v>

84
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:21.400
<v Speaker 1>she took it a step further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

85
00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.960
<v Speaker 1>in CFA is Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were capital controls companies,</v>

86
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.600
<v Speaker 1>gonna repatriate their profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes on companies reached in comparable</v>

87
00:05:28.601 --> 00:05:29.434
<v Speaker 1>proportions in Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were lots of restrictions on </v>

88
00:05:31.391 --> 00:05:32.224
<v Speaker 1>imports and the central bank was only </v>
<v Speaker 1>dedicated to making money in order to </v>

89
00:05:36.011 --> 00:05:36.844
<v Speaker 1>finance the governor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The model was so terribly uneconomic </v>

90
00:05:44.371 --> 00:05:47.220
<v Speaker 1>that CFA at set up a lot of taxes on </v>
<v Speaker 1>exports.</v>

91
00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:48.083
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would really think of punishing </v>

92
00:05:49.171 --> 00:05:51.510
<v Speaker 1>companies that are exporting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>selling to other countries.</v>

93
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:53.430
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty crazy indeed.</v>

94
00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:58.913
<v Speaker 5>Going to celebrate what he saw.</v>
<v Speaker 5>A ton of posts get Tina independent </v>

95
00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:16.450
<v Speaker 5>dealer Florida or something.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I can't do it,</v>

96
00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:26.423
<v Speaker 1>but that isn't all with Christina at the</v>
<v Speaker 1>helm of the castle respond on the </v>

97
00:06:28.611 --> 00:06:29.444
<v Speaker 1>Argentina Whitehouse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country became one of the most </v>

98
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:32.424
<v Speaker 1>protectionist in all of Latin America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and also a country where setting up </v>

99
00:06:35.701 --> 00:06:36.534
<v Speaker 1>companies was incredibly difficult and </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course the results they were </v>

100
00:06:39.421 --> 00:06:42.390
<v Speaker 1>immediate during his second term growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>was no.</v>

101
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:43.233
<v Speaker 1>The public deficits sort inflation rose </v>
<v Speaker 1>to 40 percent investment collapsed and </v>

102
00:06:47.191 --> 00:06:48.450
<v Speaker 1>suddenly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

103
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.343
<v Speaker 1>nothing seemed to be.</v>

104
00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.570
<v Speaker 6>This is how</v>

105
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:53.403
<v Speaker 1>in December of 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Argentinian people chose Mauricio </v>

106
00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:57.633
<v Speaker 1>Macri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former presidents of Boca junior as the </v>

107
00:06:59.231 --> 00:07:01.090
<v Speaker 1>new president of Argentina.</v>

108
00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.530
<v Speaker 6>Tito said he didn't see me in the door.</v>
<v Speaker 6>The end,</v>

109
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:09.290
<v Speaker 6>the color can dino.</v>

110
00:07:23.970 --> 00:07:24.803
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mauricio Macri is first year at leading </v>

111
00:07:29.331 --> 00:07:30.890
<v Speaker 1>Argentina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't easy.</v>

112
00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:31.783
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this was bound to happen because of the </v>

113
00:07:33.050 --> 00:07:35.900
<v Speaker 1>terrible state that he inherited the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country and for example,</v>

114
00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:38.240
<v Speaker 1>he reduced electricity and natural gas </v>
<v Speaker 1>subsidies,</v>

115
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:40.700
<v Speaker 1>but because reforms never have immediate</v>
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>

116
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:42.950
<v Speaker 1>things didn't look so great at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning.</v>

117
00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:46.073
<v Speaker 1>In 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country suffered a severe recession </v>

118
00:07:48.271 --> 00:07:50.550
<v Speaker 1>with a GDP drop of two point six </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

119
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Inflation also approached 40 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty.</v>

120
00:07:53.040 --> 00:07:56.250
<v Speaker 1>Unemployment deficits and external debt </v>
<v Speaker 1>also increased.</v>

121
00:07:56.370 --> 00:07:57.203
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there were ample opportunities to </v>

122
00:07:58.471 --> 00:08:00.000
<v Speaker 1>criticize mackerel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

123
00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:02.310
<v Speaker 1>wasn't he the one who promised that </v>
<v Speaker 1>things were going to change?</v>

124
00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:05.550
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

125
00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.730
<v Speaker 1>as we said a minute ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reforms do not have immediate results,</v>

126
00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:13.760
<v Speaker 1>but in the end those changes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they do arrive in 2017.</v>

127
00:08:16.341 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>The Argentine economy was finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>showing signs of improvement.</v>

128
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:20.233
<v Speaker 1>This year's growth may exceed three </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent in the appetite for investment </v>

129
00:08:22.820 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>is already more than evidence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>

130
00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.830
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It looks like Argentina maybe coming out</v>

131
00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>of that</v>

132
00:08:28.550 --> 00:08:33.550
<v Speaker 3>tunnel.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Philadelphia</v>

133
00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:39.683
<v Speaker 1>being these results have given macri the</v>
<v Speaker 1>great electoral victory that we've just </v>

134
00:08:43.111 --> 00:08:44.850
<v Speaker 1>seen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now we come to the question of,</v>

135
00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:46.710
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what exactly did the president do?</v>

136
00:08:46.770 --> 00:08:47.603
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically he reduced all of the crazy </v>

137
00:08:48.931 --> 00:08:50.820
<v Speaker 1>regulations and policies that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>put in</v>

138
00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.693
<v Speaker 3>place.</v>

139
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:55.710
<v Speaker 1>The new government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seemed to work reducing these because</v>

140
00:08:55.711 --> 00:08:58.800
<v Speaker 1>in their eyes there was no time to lose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As soon as he arrived,</v>

141
00:08:58.801 --> 00:08:59.634
<v Speaker 1>he eliminated currency controls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He allowed foreign investors to </v>

142
00:09:01.861 --> 00:09:05.220
<v Speaker 1>repatriate their profits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the eliminated the most incomprehensible</v>

143
00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.113
<v Speaker 1>export taxes and reduce subsidies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on imports and all of this </v>

144
00:09:10.081 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>was with one clear objective,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

145
00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:15.900
<v Speaker 1>to recover its productive economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>

146
00:09:15.901 --> 00:09:16.734
<v Speaker 1>and this is really important here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mackery reached agreements with some of </v>

147
00:09:19.021 --> 00:09:19.854
<v Speaker 1>the international investors that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina hadn't paid in 2001 and with </v>

148
00:09:23.581 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>whom it's still had judicial fights.</v>

149
00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:35.180
<v Speaker 1>Tina reached an agreement with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>venture funds after 14 years of struggle</v>

150
00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:37.700
<v Speaker 1>in total to cover all the debts with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds,</v>

151
00:09:37.770 --> 00:09:40.850
<v Speaker 1>mccree offers $6,500,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million dollars.</v>

152
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:43.760
<v Speaker 1>This agreement implies a 25 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reduction.</v>

153
00:09:43.910 --> 00:09:46.550
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is the new </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's approved to kinds of fiscal</v>

154
00:09:46.551 --> 00:09:50.060
<v Speaker 1>amnesty which brought to light new less </v>
<v Speaker 1>than a hundred and $17.</v>

155
00:09:50.061 --> 00:09:50.894
<v Speaker 1>Billion Dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligent Indians had a broad and did </v>

156
00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:53.443
<v Speaker 1>not declared,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before you think this is a huge </v>

157
00:09:55.221 --> 00:09:56.054
<v Speaker 1>scandal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think about what would happen if </v>

158
00:09:57.261 --> 00:10:00.680
<v Speaker 1>you were afraid that your savings could </v>
<v Speaker 1>be confiscated by the government?</v>

159
00:10:00.710 --> 00:10:03.320
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes it's not just about not paying</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes.</v>

160
00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:08.180
<v Speaker 1>When states don't have legal security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's easy for money to simply disappear.</v>

161
00:10:08.210 --> 00:10:09.710
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that with all these </v>
<v Speaker 1>measures,</v>

162
00:10:09.711 --> 00:10:10.544
<v Speaker 1>macaroons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>government has managed to get much of </v>

163
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:15.080
<v Speaker 1>that money back to Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and since then there's been an influx of</v>

164
00:10:15.081 --> 00:10:17.430
<v Speaker 1>money which has triggered things like </v>
<v Speaker 1>real estate sales,</v>

165
00:10:17.660 --> 00:10:20.330
<v Speaker 1>car sales.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are breaking records.</v>

166
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.100
<v Speaker 1>More than 700.</v>
<v Speaker 1>80,000</v>

167
00:10:22.101 --> 00:10:25.040
<v Speaker 1>cars have been sold to this day and most</v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly trucks.</v>

168
00:10:25.070 --> 00:10:27.680
<v Speaker 1>This means that production is moving.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Constructionist moving.</v>

169
00:10:27.770 --> 00:10:29.870
<v Speaker 1>Mauricio Macri,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it looks like the engine,</v>

170
00:10:29.930 --> 00:10:34.790
<v Speaker 1>quite literally it started again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>looks organ will invest $650,</v>

171
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:37.670
<v Speaker 1>million US dollars to modernize plants </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Argentina,</v>

172
00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 3>but</v>

173
00:10:48.270 --> 00:10:50.940
<v Speaker 1>one question arises and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>

174
00:10:50.941 --> 00:10:51.774
<v Speaker 1>randy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So exemplary is everything really so </v>

175
00:10:53.580 --> 00:10:54.540
<v Speaker 1>perfect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

176
00:10:54.570 --> 00:10:55.403
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute because the truth is </v>
<v Speaker 1>that until now the reforms have been </v>

177
00:10:57.961 --> 00:10:58.794
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very gradual than that and had a fairly </v>

178
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:01.164
<v Speaker 1>limited range,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something in spite of the electoral </v>

179
00:11:03.181 --> 00:11:04.014
<v Speaker 1>results and all those calls to uncork </v>
<v Speaker 1>the champagne has alerted several </v>

180
00:11:07.441 --> 00:11:08.274
<v Speaker 1>experts at the moment of truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far he hasn't done much beyond </v>

181
00:11:11.971 --> 00:11:14.530
<v Speaker 1>removing kitchener ism from power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which isn't little,</v>

182
00:11:14.580 --> 00:11:15.413
<v Speaker 1>even though he did say that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections are the endorsement for the </v>

183
00:11:17.761 --> 00:11:19.710
<v Speaker 1>reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We don't really know what they are,</v>

184
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:21.870
<v Speaker 1>what he wants to do.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Rodriguez,</v>

185
00:11:21.871 --> 00:11:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Braun,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>

186
00:11:22.921 --> 00:11:25.920
<v Speaker 1>economist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But why so much distrust?</v>

187
00:11:25.980 --> 00:11:26.813
<v Speaker 1>Because despite the reforms we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems that this government is </v>

188
00:11:29.251 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>struggling to overcome some of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>typical problems of Argentina's previous</v>

189
00:11:33.361 --> 00:11:34.470
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

190
00:11:34.471 --> 00:11:37.650
<v Speaker 1>public spending has not decreased.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It continues to rise and rise,</v>

191
00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:39.240
<v Speaker 1>which has caused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

192
00:11:39.270 --> 00:11:40.103
<v Speaker 1>foreign debt to soul by more than $50,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars since macri came to </v>

193
00:11:43.351 --> 00:11:47.610
<v Speaker 1>power and that's not all taxes are </v>
<v Speaker 1>through the roof.</v>

194
00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:48.473
<v Speaker 1>The central bank continues to finance </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government with new money as </v>

195
00:11:50.641 --> 00:11:52.770
<v Speaker 1>according to the latest doing business </v>
<v Speaker 1>reports,</v>

196
00:11:52.771 --> 00:11:54.970
<v Speaker 1>which the ease of doing business in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

197
00:11:55.030 --> 00:11:59.350
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is still way down in 116th </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

198
00:12:04.590 --> 00:12:05.221
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be fair,</v>

199
00:12:05.221 --> 00:12:07.800
<v Speaker 1>we can see the macro has pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuses.</v>

200
00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:08.663
<v Speaker 1>First is that not much time has passed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and second is political position in </v>

201
00:12:11.641 --> 00:12:14.090
<v Speaker 1>Congress in the Senate was very weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

202
00:12:14.091 --> 00:12:14.924
<v Speaker 1>but after these last elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of that is finally over reformist </v>

203
00:12:24.760 --> 00:12:25.593
<v Speaker 1>agenda.</v>

204
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:30.250
<v Speaker 1>It seems that often has crushing </v>
<v Speaker 1>electoral trump.</v>

205
00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:35.280
<v Speaker 1>President Macri has made it clear we are</v>
<v Speaker 1>entering a stage of permanent reformism.</v>

206
00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:36.453
<v Speaker 1>Argentina doesn't have to stop.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't have to fear reforms because </v>

207
00:12:38.801 --> 00:12:40.510
<v Speaker 1>to reform is to grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to evolve,</v>

208
00:12:40.570 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>to progress the ratio mccree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He certainly has a task out of him,</v>

209
00:12:44.021 --> 00:12:46.480
<v Speaker 1>which is somewhat complicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

210
00:12:46.481 --> 00:12:48.010
<v Speaker 1>what are his priorities?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

211
00:12:48.011 --> 00:12:48.844
<v Speaker 1>fundamentally view at first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that is as popular as it </v>

212
00:12:52.301 --> 00:12:55.660
<v Speaker 1>is necessary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing public deficits and controlling</v>

213
00:12:55.661 --> 00:12:59.620
<v Speaker 1>inflation which are ultimately related.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he's going to get Argentina back to</v>

214
00:12:59.621 --> 00:13:02.950
<v Speaker 1>being a competitive and attractive </v>
<v Speaker 1>country in which to invest.</v>

215
00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:03.843
<v Speaker 1>To achieve this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has promised to approve a tax reform </v>

216
00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:06.453
<v Speaker 1>that reduces taxes on businesses and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>labor reform that facilitates hiring as </v>

217
00:13:10.061 --> 00:13:10.894
<v Speaker 1>well as more free trade agreements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina and Chile signed the most </v>

218
00:13:14.051 --> 00:13:16.510
<v Speaker 1>ambitious free trade agreement in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

219
00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.160
<v Speaker 1>Then pension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational,</v>

220
00:13:18.161 --> 00:13:20.350
<v Speaker 1>and infrastructure reforms.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The next yes,</v>

221
00:13:20.351 --> 00:13:23.500
<v Speaker 1>we can assess and say the macro has a </v>
<v Speaker 1>lot of work to do if you want us to meet</v>

222
00:13:23.501 --> 00:13:25.480
<v Speaker 1>the high expectations that have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>placed</v>

223
00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:29.090
<v Speaker 7>on him.</v>
<v Speaker 7>In any case,</v>

224
00:13:29.100 --> 00:13:33.590
<v Speaker 1>it does seem as if a new political and </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic era has begun the entre.</v>

225
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.760
<v Speaker 1>Tina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a good example is [inaudible] commitment</v>

226
00:13:35.761 --> 00:13:36.594
<v Speaker 1>to reducing poverty by formalizing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>extending property to the most </v>

227
00:13:39.781 --> 00:13:40.614
<v Speaker 1>disadvantaged.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina delivers housing certificates </v>

228
00:13:43.081 --> 00:13:43.914
<v Speaker 1>to one point 5 million people in slums.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government will give them the documents </v>

229
00:13:47.761 --> 00:13:50.790
<v Speaker 1>to access water and electricity legally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>

230
00:13:50.791 --> 00:13:53.610
<v Speaker 1>we will be discussing how to find </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty in a future video.</v>

231
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:55.890
<v Speaker 1>Subscribe for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

232
00:13:55.891 --> 00:13:58.140
<v Speaker 1>will this country become great?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

233
00:13:58.170 --> 00:13:59.003
<v Speaker 1>if they manage to deepen their reforms </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take advantage of all their </v>

234
00:14:01.291 --> 00:14:02.490
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not trans.</v>

235
00:14:02.560 --> 00:14:05.010
<v Speaker 1>The lithium industry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which we've discussed previously.</v>

236
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:05.903
<v Speaker 1>I have little doubt that this will be </v>
