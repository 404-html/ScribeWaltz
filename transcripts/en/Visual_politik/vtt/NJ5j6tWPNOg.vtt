00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.100
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.390
<v Speaker 2>it's hard to put a sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Two thoughts when thinking about Africa.</v>

3
00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.230
<v Speaker 2>The first is the thing that Africa is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>continent forever sentence do poverty,</v>

4
00:00:15.231 --> 00:00:16.064
<v Speaker 2>illness,</v>
<v Speaker 2>starvation and tragedy and the loss of </v>

5
00:00:18.141 --> 00:00:18.974
<v Speaker 2>tragedy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the Africa is often thought of as a </v>

6
00:00:20.191 --> 00:00:24.490
<v Speaker 2>somewhat compact territory web.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Everything is connected to westernize.</v>

7
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.333
<v Speaker 2>Africa can look more like a country than</v>
<v Speaker 2>a consonance with many feedings or </v>

8
00:00:28.241 --> 00:00:31.640
<v Speaker 2>realize the colossal size on this </v>
<v Speaker 2>continent.</v>

9
00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Africa is as big as Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the US,</v>

10
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.310
<v Speaker 2>India,</v>
<v Speaker 2>China and Argentina combined.</v>

11
00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.710
<v Speaker 2>So now you can imagine the deluge </v>
<v Speaker 2>felicity,</v>

12
00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.690
<v Speaker 2>that this huge territory must contain in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2010 if the economist referred to Africa</v>

13
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.470
<v Speaker 2>as the consonants without hope buses as </v>
<v Speaker 2>can often happen,</v>

14
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.820
<v Speaker 2>things rapidly changed in Africa since </v>
<v Speaker 2>the start of the 21st century.</v>

15
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.760
<v Speaker 2>Africa that has experienced a </v>
<v Speaker 2>significant boost,</v>

16
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.623
<v Speaker 2>especially in the poorest countries on </v>
<v Speaker 2>the continent with the exception of </v>

17
00:00:59.481 --> 00:01:00.314
<v Speaker 2>South Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The countries of sub Saharan Africa </v>

18
00:01:02.091 --> 00:01:02.924
<v Speaker 2>achieved annual growth rates of 6.2%</v>
<v Speaker 2>while comparison that is twice the </v>

19
00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:08.024
<v Speaker 2>growth rates of countries in Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>America during the same time period in </v>

20
00:01:11.361 --> 00:01:15.320
<v Speaker 2>2015 five of the 10 economies that grew </v>
<v Speaker 2>the most in the world.</v>

21
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.140
<v Speaker 2>Where in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these are the Ivory Coast,</v>

22
00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.420
<v Speaker 2>Ethiopia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania,</v>

23
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.840
<v Speaker 2>Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Democratic Republic of Congo.</v>

24
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.440
<v Speaker 2>The growth rate of these countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>exceeded 7%</v>

25
00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:28.343
<v Speaker 3>Democratic Republic of Congo is been </v>
<v Speaker 3>ranked among the top 10 countries for </v>

26
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:33.300
<v Speaker 3>reforms in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

27
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.420
<v Speaker 3>in 2014 there are already nearly 7,000</v>
<v Speaker 3>enterprises that have been created.</v>

28
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.280
<v Speaker 2>Although the growth figures were a bit </v>
<v Speaker 2>smaller,</v>

29
00:01:40.281 --> 00:01:41.114
<v Speaker 2>the situation remains similar in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>year 2016 all of this growth has led to </v>

30
00:01:44.781 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 2>some really significant social </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

31
00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:47.834
<v Speaker 2>So let's have a look at some of these.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Foreign life expectancy has increased </v>

32
00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:51.674
<v Speaker 2>significantly over the last eight years </v>
<v Speaker 2>and child mortality figures and those </v>

33
00:01:54.291 --> 00:01:57.440
<v Speaker 2>dying from starvation has been cut in </v>
<v Speaker 2>half.</v>

34
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.303
<v Speaker 2>To sum up extreme poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you still affect 58% of the population </v>

35
00:02:01.551 --> 00:02:02.384
<v Speaker 2>in 1990 900 now it is decreased to just </v>
<v Speaker 2>35% it is still true that more than 420 </v>

36
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.660
<v Speaker 2>million people are still suffering from </v>
<v Speaker 2>extreme poverty in Africa,</v>

37
00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.523
<v Speaker 2>which is tragic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's fortunately the future is </v>

38
00:02:14.661 --> 00:02:15.860
<v Speaker 2>looking brighter than ever.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>

39
00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:16.723
<v Speaker 2>Another thing is also certain Africa is </v>
<v Speaker 2>going to have a major global role over </v>

40
00:02:20.751 --> 00:02:25.751
<v Speaker 2>the coming decades and it's middleclass </v>
<v Speaker 2>or consumer class is the fastest growing</v>

41
00:02:25.941 --> 00:02:26.774
<v Speaker 2>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is Africa is no longer an </v>

42
00:02:29.751 --> 00:02:32.330
<v Speaker 2>emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is here now.</v>

43
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.283
<v Speaker 2>Africa is being urbanized quickly which </v>
<v Speaker 2>allows for both the provision of public </v>

44
00:02:36.201 --> 00:02:39.590
<v Speaker 2>services and also economies of scale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the near future.</v>

45
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.580
<v Speaker 2>We are going to find as many of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world's biggest cities are on this call.</v>

46
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.663
<v Speaker 1>Smith</v>

47
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.593
<v Speaker 2>who knows Lagos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nairobi or accurate money to become the </v>

48
00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:52.880
<v Speaker 2>new Shanghai in just a few short </v>
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>

49
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:53.743
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the tallest skyscraper in Africa for </v>

50
00:02:55.551 --> 00:02:58.430
<v Speaker 2>Haas Tower is currently being built in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nairobi in Acra,</v>

51
00:02:58.431 --> 00:02:59.264
<v Speaker 2>the capitalist of Ghana.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Six malls have been built in only six </v>

52
00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:02.884
<v Speaker 2>years and while that might not seem like</v>
<v Speaker 2>a lot when you consider that there was </v>

53
00:03:05.621 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 2>only one mall in the entire city before </v>
<v Speaker 2>those six new ones were built,</v>

54
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:10.354
<v Speaker 2>it seems like a little bit more foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments has also grown strongly in </v>

55
00:03:13.451 --> 00:03:16.420
<v Speaker 2>the last few years and it's half of </v>
<v Speaker 2>these investments operating areas they'd</v>

56
00:03:16.421 --> 00:03:19.060
<v Speaker 2>have nothing to do with Africa's natural</v>
<v Speaker 2>resources.</v>

57
00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:19.923
<v Speaker 2>This is important because many of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries in Africa are trying to </v>

58
00:03:22.091 --> 00:03:24.310
<v Speaker 2>develop industries outside of raw </v>
<v Speaker 2>materials,</v>

59
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 2>so they are depending less on these </v>
<v Speaker 2>natural resources.</v>

60
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.370
<v Speaker 2>These economies are known as the African</v>
<v Speaker 2>lions,</v>

61
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.960
<v Speaker 2>the African lions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These African lions include Kenya,</v>

62
00:03:37.961 --> 00:03:39.330
<v Speaker 2>Uganda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tanzania,</v>

63
00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.020
<v Speaker 2>Mozambique and Zambia.</v>

64
00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.140
<v Speaker 2>These other countries in Africa that are</v>
<v Speaker 2>developing the fastest.</v>

65
00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Now we're going to discuss each of them </v>
<v Speaker 2>in detail in upcoming videos,</v>

66
00:03:47.231 --> 00:03:49.990
<v Speaker 2>but today we're just going to focus on </v>
<v Speaker 2>three of them.</v>

67
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.013
<v Speaker 2>Russel Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is a small country with a </v>

68
00:03:54.431 --> 00:03:57.970
<v Speaker 2>population of only 12 million people and</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't have any coastline.</v>

69
00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.833
<v Speaker 2>It is still a poor country but it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>registered and almost 9% annual growth </v>

70
00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.033
<v Speaker 2>since the year 2001 and importantly this</v>
<v Speaker 2>country has no oil or other important </v>

71
00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.150
<v Speaker 2>natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the big question is,</v>

72
00:04:10.151 --> 00:04:13.120
<v Speaker 2>well how did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has actually been mostly down.</v>

73
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:17.020
<v Speaker 2>So you supporting business creation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why Rwanda is the second easiest</v>

74
00:04:17.021 --> 00:04:17.854
<v Speaker 2>country to do business in in sub Saharan</v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa according to the world's bank </v>

75
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:21.693
<v Speaker 2>doing business report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question you might be asking is </v>

76
00:04:23.651 --> 00:04:25.960
<v Speaker 2>this is a coincidence and we have visual</v>
<v Speaker 2>politic,</v>

77
00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.250
<v Speaker 2>we really don't think so.</v>

78
00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.600
<v Speaker 2>We are know what example looking at </v>
<v Speaker 2>under the 50th their 50th if we got word</v>

79
00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:32.443
<v Speaker 2>organized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if we other way with it and you put </v>

80
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.100
<v Speaker 2>everything that's needed and to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world are connected.</v>

81
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.310
<v Speaker 2>The portable growth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now thanks to all of this,</v>

82
00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:40.173
<v Speaker 2>nearly all children have primary </v>
<v Speaker 2>education and as a 98% of its people </v>

83
00:04:43.391 --> 00:04:45.880
<v Speaker 2>already have access to health care.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As a consequence,</v>

84
00:04:45.881 --> 00:04:46.714
<v Speaker 2>child mortality has been reduced by 60% </v>
<v Speaker 2>had to aids and malaria have also seen </v>

85
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 2>significant reductions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Further Rwanda,</v>

86
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.424
<v Speaker 2>President Paul Kagame,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he claims to be a disciple of Lee Kuan </v>

87
00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 2>Yew,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the legendary leader of Singapore.</v>

88
00:04:58.991 --> 00:05:01.060
<v Speaker 2>Here we're going to be discussing in an </v>
<v Speaker 2>upcoming episode,</v>

89
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:02.920
<v Speaker 2>so don't forget to subscribe if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't already,</v>

90
00:05:02.921 --> 00:05:03.754
<v Speaker 2>so you will get notified of our bats.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And also Wayne miss out on any of our </v>

91
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:08.810
<v Speaker 2>other videos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you up yet</v>

92
00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:12.123
<v Speaker 2>is a much larger country with a </v>
<v Speaker 2>population of nearly 100 million people </v>

93
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:16.383
<v Speaker 2>in Ethiopia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Around 20 million people still have </v>

94
00:05:18.731 --> 00:05:21.190
<v Speaker 2>nutritional problems and that is not the</v>
<v Speaker 2>only problem they have.</v>

95
00:05:21.191 --> 00:05:23.710
<v Speaker 2>The government's also become more </v>
<v Speaker 2>authoritarian recently.</v>

96
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.510
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>things aren't changing fast.</v>

97
00:05:25.511 --> 00:05:26.344
<v Speaker 2>And today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ethiopia's Capitol Adis Abba is always </v>

98
00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:30.970
<v Speaker 2>pursuing significant construction </v>
<v Speaker 2>projects.</v>

99
00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:32.580
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>about a year ago at us,</v>

100
00:05:32.581 --> 00:05:33.414
<v Speaker 2>out of the bar opens the first modern </v>
<v Speaker 2>tram system in all of sub Saharan </v>

101
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:37.031
<v Speaker 2>Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be honest,</v>

102
00:05:37.031 --> 00:05:37.864
<v Speaker 2>they deserve it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ethiopia is a country which has grown </v>

103
00:05:39.671 --> 00:05:40.504
<v Speaker 2>significantly in the last 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's economy as multiplied by a factor </v>

104
00:05:43.691 --> 00:05:48.040
<v Speaker 2>of five in this period and it's GDP has </v>
<v Speaker 2>grown by over 10% every year.</v>

105
00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:48.923
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

106
00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.640
<v Speaker 2>Now you might be asking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

107
00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:56.930
<v Speaker 2>how did they do it?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

108
00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:57.793
<v Speaker 2>they were simply trying to be more </v>
<v Speaker 2>attractive to investors and then </v>

109
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.700
<v Speaker 2>neighboring countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In doing so,</v>

110
00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.550
<v Speaker 2>the country has established at two main </v>
<v Speaker 2>priorities.</v>

111
00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 2>One achieved stable macro economics and </v>
<v Speaker 2>to establish attractive taxation,</v>

112
00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:11.450
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in boards of technological equipment</v>

113
00:06:11.451 --> 00:06:12.284
<v Speaker 2>such as machinery,</v>
<v Speaker 2>does not have any important charge that </v>

114
00:06:14.681 --> 00:06:17.450
<v Speaker 2>other companies don't have to pay any </v>
<v Speaker 2>tax in their first five years,</v>

115
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.930
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty cool.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

116
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>We couldn't do this video without </v>
<v Speaker 2>mentioning Botswana,</v>

117
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:27.613
<v Speaker 2>the country which recently celebrated in</v>
<v Speaker 2>2016 at the 50th anniversary of its </v>

118
00:06:31.311 --> 00:06:32.144
<v Speaker 2>independence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What's one APP has been the greatest </v>

119
00:06:34.161 --> 00:06:36.890
<v Speaker 2>economic success story in all of Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

120
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:37.724
<v Speaker 2>it is even one of the most successful </v>
<v Speaker 2>worldwide at the time of Botswana's </v>

121
00:06:40.671 --> 00:06:41.504
<v Speaker 2>independence in the year 1966 it was one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the poorest countries on the planet </v>

122
00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:46.513
<v Speaker 2>on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so the country has suffered severe </v>

123
00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:48.404
<v Speaker 2>droughts and does suffered from the </v>
<v Speaker 2>second largest aids epidemic in the </v>

124
00:06:51.081 --> 00:06:53.510
<v Speaker 2>world.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In spite of all these obstacles,</v>

125
00:06:53.511 --> 00:06:55.320
<v Speaker 2>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has experienced developments,</v>

126
00:06:55.321 --> 00:06:56.154
<v Speaker 2>so significance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's GDP in purchasing power parity </v>

127
00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:01.280
<v Speaker 2>is equivalent to two countries such as </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia,</v>

128
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:02.840
<v Speaker 2>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Thailand's.</v>

129
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.703
<v Speaker 2>This is obviously considering the </v>
<v Speaker 2>different levels of prices among these </v>

130
00:07:05.841 --> 00:07:06.560
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>

131
00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.393
<v Speaker 5>Si.</v>

132
00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:12.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the key to success and can be found in </v>

133
00:07:14.261 --> 00:07:15.094
<v Speaker 2>the strength of its national </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions that healthy public </v>

134
00:07:17.621 --> 00:07:21.010
<v Speaker 2>finances and above all the country's </v>
<v Speaker 2>legal certainty.</v>

135
00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:21.903
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in the last CPI corruption perception </v>

136
00:07:23.501 --> 00:07:26.290
<v Speaker 2>index,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Botswana was ranked in 31st position.</v>

137
00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:28.660
<v Speaker 2>This is a better position than countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>like Spain,</v>

138
00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or Taiwan,</v>

139
00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:30.903
<v Speaker 2>rule of law,</v>

140
00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:34.800
<v Speaker 6>regulatory reform,</v>
<v Speaker 6>good governance,</v>

141
00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:38.580
<v Speaker 6>all those things matter even more </v>
<v Speaker 6>because people should be able to start a</v>

142
00:07:38.581 --> 00:07:39.414
<v Speaker 6>business and ship their goods without </v>
<v Speaker 6>having to pay a bribe or hire somebody </v>

143
00:07:41.951 --> 00:07:42.770
<v Speaker 6>whose cousin.</v>

144
00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:43.603
<v Speaker 2>But now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how about some more surprising facts </v>

145
00:07:45.111 --> 00:07:45.944
<v Speaker 2>about Africa?</v>
<v Speaker 2>You should know that this continent is </v>

146
00:07:47.691 --> 00:07:48.524
<v Speaker 2>already home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a 400 companies with a turnover of </v>

147
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:51.944
<v Speaker 2>more than a billion dollars a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it really does seem that the ends of </v>

148
00:07:54.891 --> 00:07:58.410
<v Speaker 2>Africa being a totally poor consonant is</v>
<v Speaker 2>coming to an end.</v>

149
00:07:58.500 --> 00:07:59.333
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore in Africa we can also find </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nollywood is the second largest film </v>

150
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:04.610
<v Speaker 2>industry in terms of films produced in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

151
00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.220
<v Speaker 2>Only 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 2>films less than Bollywood.</v>

152
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:08.083
<v Speaker 2>Further in Nigeria alone,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the film industry employees around a </v>

153
00:08:10.791 --> 00:08:15.791
<v Speaker 2>million workers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now for just one final surprise,</v>

154
00:08:18.260 --> 00:08:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Africa is the wells leader in online </v>
<v Speaker 2>banking and mobile phone payments.</v>

155
00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:24.710
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably weren't expecting that,</v>

156
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.603
<v Speaker 2>but it is absolutely true today many </v>
<v Speaker 2>farmers share information through SMS </v>

157
00:08:28.881 --> 00:08:32.510
<v Speaker 2>and in the string silvery ones it is </v>
<v Speaker 2>popular to use safe motos,</v>

158
00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.170
<v Speaker 2>which is like a Rwandan version of Uber,</v>
<v Speaker 2>except there's a small difference.</v>

159
00:08:36.170 --> 00:08:37.003
<v Speaker 2>Instead of using cars,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they use motorcycles because there are </v>

160
00:08:38.971 --> 00:08:39.804
<v Speaker 2>very few cars available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the thing about Africa is that it is </v>

161
00:08:42.051 --> 00:08:42.884
<v Speaker 2>changing incredibly fast,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that there are still </v>

162
00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 2>many challenges and difficulties that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the continent is going to face.</v>

163
00:08:49.281 --> 00:08:50.330
<v Speaker 2>A hat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for example,</v>

164
00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:51.193
<v Speaker 2>consolidating the rule of law,</v>
<v Speaker 2>reducing poverty and improving their </v>

165
00:08:53.571 --> 00:08:56.130
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course they supports in ends once</v>

166
00:08:56.131 --> 00:09:00.000
<v Speaker 2>and for all to all those terrible </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorships in countries like Angola,</v>

167
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:02.490
<v Speaker 2>Eritrea or Equatorial Guinea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

168
00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:06.840
<v Speaker 2>everything does seem to indicate that </v>
<v Speaker 2>the future of Africa is brighter than it</v>

169
00:09:06.841 --> 00:09:07.674
<v Speaker 2>has ever been.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I hope you found that video </v>

<v Speaker 2>become a major player in the coming </v>
