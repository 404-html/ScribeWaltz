1
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.863
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president of the United States and the </v>

2
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:11.864
<v Speaker 1>world's most powerful man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A lot has been said about his auntie </v>

3
00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:14.924
<v Speaker 1>liberal agenda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question today is can he really </v>

4
00:00:17.241 --> 00:00:19.480
<v Speaker 1>put it all into place?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The bigger question here,</v>

5
00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.400
<v Speaker 1>the how powerful is the presidents of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States?</v>

6
00:00:22.401 --> 00:00:23.234
<v Speaker 1>Really?</v>

7
00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:25.950
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a look at it</v>

8
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.783
<v Speaker 1>as an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump would get up one morning </v>

9
00:00:28.471 --> 00:00:29.304
<v Speaker 1>and launched a couple of nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>warheads to another country without </v>

10
00:00:31.711 --> 00:00:34.310
<v Speaker 1>passing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A congress can listen,</v>

11
00:00:34.311 --> 00:00:35.144
<v Speaker 1>is all the supreme court stop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>massive deportations that he's proposed </v>

12
00:00:38.041 --> 00:00:39.810
<v Speaker 1>during his campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget,</v>

13
00:00:39.811 --> 00:00:43.440
<v Speaker 1>it's a democracy in the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>congratulates itself Fur.</v>

14
00:00:43.441 --> 00:00:48.441
<v Speaker 1>It's clear distinction between executive</v>
<v Speaker 1>judicial and legislative branches.</v>

15
00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.733
<v Speaker 1>This system of checks and balances once </v>
<v Speaker 1>designed to prevent an eventual </v>

16
00:00:52.621 --> 00:00:57.600
<v Speaker 1>psychopath from taking over the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's creating chaos like seizing the</v>

17
00:00:57.601 --> 00:00:58.434
<v Speaker 1>power that he was given,</v>
<v Speaker 1>buying the citizen with this system in </v>

18
00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:04.384
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The presidents of the United States or </v>

19
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:06.723
<v Speaker 1>Otis has a lot of authority to do things</v>
<v Speaker 1>unilaterally without having to ask </v>

20
00:01:10.091 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>permission of any court parliaments and </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe you me,</v>

21
00:01:13.271 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>some of these things are pretty darn </v>
<v Speaker 1>scary today.</v>

22
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:17.314
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to tell you about some of </v>

23
00:01:18.071 --> 00:01:18.904
<v Speaker 1>the things that Donald Trump can do by </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and we're doing it along with </v>

24
00:01:21.551 --> 00:01:22.384
<v Speaker 1>our friend Eric [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eric is the cofounder of reconsider </v>

25
00:01:25.061 --> 00:01:25.894
<v Speaker 1>media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most influential political </v>

26
00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:29.020
<v Speaker 1>podcasts in America.</v>

27
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.630
<v Speaker 3>Hello Simon and hello to all the visual </v>
<v Speaker 3>politics subscribers.</v>

28
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 3>That's the nuclear football exists.</v>

29
00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.020
<v Speaker 1>The answer is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh yes,</v>

30
00:01:42.021 --> 00:01:44.150
<v Speaker 1>it does,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because when you play Football,</v>

31
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.840
<v Speaker 1>Aka the Doomsday Boston does exist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

32
00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.540
<v Speaker 1>it's carried in the briefcase that we're</v>
<v Speaker 1>showing in the picture.</v>

33
00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.543
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.133
<v Speaker 3>President presses that button.</v>
<v Speaker 3>He's sending an order to to US army </v>

35
00:02:01.321 --> 00:02:02.154
<v Speaker 3>officials.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Usually lieutenants were stationed </v>

36
00:02:04.051 --> 00:02:07.380
<v Speaker 3>aboard a combat jet that has a nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 3>weapon.</v>

37
00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.500
<v Speaker 3>Each of these lieutenants has a key.</v>
<v Speaker 3>When they turned those keys,</v>

38
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.000
<v Speaker 3>at the same time they deploy and launch </v>
<v Speaker 3>the nuclear weapon.</v>

39
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:18.353
<v Speaker 1>Be Wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it required that Congress passed a </v>

40
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.940
<v Speaker 1>law or some kind of special order in </v>
<v Speaker 1>order to launch that nuke,</v>

41
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.983
<v Speaker 1>and the answer is a resounding no.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The presidents can give the order to </v>

42
00:02:28.141 --> 00:02:30.960
<v Speaker 1>launch and you just about any time he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants.</v>

43
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.153
<v Speaker 1>Just like</v>

44
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.523
<v Speaker 3>resident could push the button all by </v>
<v Speaker 3>himself or herself legally and </v>

45
00:02:39.591 --> 00:02:42.140
<v Speaker 3>constitutionally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 3>physically,</v>

46
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.200
<v Speaker 3>military personnel would need to carry </v>
<v Speaker 3>out the strike.</v>

47
00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.363
<v Speaker 3>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 3>any military officer ignoring a </v>

48
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:49.274
<v Speaker 3>presidential order would be an opening </v>
<v Speaker 3>subordination subject to dismissal and </v>

49
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:54.560
<v Speaker 3>court martialed.</v>

50
00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.120
<v Speaker 1>All of this comes from the time of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cold War.</v>

51
00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.380
<v Speaker 1>The United States felt existentially </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatened by the Soviet Union.</v>

52
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:08.333
<v Speaker 1>They worried that eventually the Soviets</v>
<v Speaker 1>would be able to nuke any American city </v>

53
00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.220
<v Speaker 1>at any time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If this would be the case,</v>

54
00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:15.293
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We need to be able to react with the </v>

55
00:03:17.311 --> 00:03:22.311
<v Speaker 1>retaliatory strike immediately.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There wouldn't be time for debate in the</v>

56
00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:23.323
<v Speaker 1>House of Representatives.</v>

57
00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.140
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a minute here because there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more.</v>

58
00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.040
<v Speaker 1>Imagine Donald Trump wakes up one </v>
<v Speaker 1>morning and Zinzi isn't a big fan of the</v>

59
00:03:36.041 --> 00:03:36.874
<v Speaker 1>Chinese people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He decides to launch a new gas in </v>

60
00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.340
<v Speaker 1>Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>From a legal and constitutional point of</v>

61
00:03:42.341 --> 00:03:44.500
<v Speaker 1>view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he is allowed to do so,</v>

62
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't going to be for free.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this example,</v>

63
00:03:47.591 --> 00:03:48.424
<v Speaker 1>launching a bombing against China would </v>
<v Speaker 1>violate several international treaties </v>

64
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.610
<v Speaker 1>as well as agreements between the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States and China.</v>

65
00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.473
<v Speaker 1>This means the US Congress would ask him</v>
<v Speaker 1>for an explanation or even call for a </v>

66
00:03:58.871 --> 00:04:02.410
<v Speaker 1>vote to decide whether he should be </v>
<v Speaker 1>kicked out of the Oval Office or not.</v>

67
00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:03.543
<v Speaker 1>This is a process called impeachment and</v>
<v Speaker 1>it comes into effect when the </v>

68
00:04:06.731 --> 00:04:07.564
<v Speaker 1>president's breaks a law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including treaties that the US has </v>

69
00:04:10.031 --> 00:04:13.270
<v Speaker 1>agreed to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Former presidents like Richard Nixon are</v>

70
00:04:13.271 --> 00:04:14.104
<v Speaker 1>rather familiar with this process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is not the ends of things though </v>

71
00:04:26.291 --> 00:04:27.124
<v Speaker 1>because there is far more than nukes in </v>
<v Speaker 1>America's arsenal and a state of </v>

72
00:04:32.311 --> 00:04:33.144
<v Speaker 1>emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so can Donald Trump declare war on </v>

73
00:04:35.881 --> 00:04:38.850
<v Speaker 1>another country all by himself?</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

74
00:04:38.851 --> 00:04:39.684
<v Speaker 1>in cases of emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president can actually send troops </v>

75
00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:43.523
<v Speaker 1>into another country without a </v>
<v Speaker 1>declaration of war by Congress ahead of </v>

76
00:04:47.431 --> 00:04:48.264
<v Speaker 1>time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's thing</v>

77
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.223
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>

78
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:53.183
<v Speaker 1>President Obama is facing criticism that</v>
<v Speaker 1>crosses the political divide for not </v>

79
00:04:57.601 --> 00:05:02.550
<v Speaker 1>seeking congressional authorization </v>
<v Speaker 1>before ordering the American military to</v>

80
00:05:02.551 --> 00:05:03.384
<v Speaker 1>join in attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tax of Libyan earth defenses and </v>

81
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:06.594
<v Speaker 1>government forces.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that if trump wanted to send </v>

82
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:10.380
<v Speaker 1>troops to a country like Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

83
00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:12.960
<v Speaker 1>you can absolutely do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can only do it for 60 days.</v>

84
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.823
<v Speaker 1>After that 60 day period,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has to report to Congress and gets a </v>

85
00:05:16.741 --> 00:05:17.574
<v Speaker 1>vote declaring war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would mean an extended military </v>

86
00:05:19.891 --> 00:05:20.724
<v Speaker 1>presence in the territory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so this means that you can send troops </v>

87
00:05:22.651 --> 00:05:23.484
<v Speaker 1>to a country if it's an emergency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you can't send them there if you </v>

88
00:05:26.041 --> 00:05:28.200
<v Speaker 1>want them to stay for longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>

89
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:30.780
<v Speaker 1>you do need Congress to approve this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

90
00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 1>once Congress has declared a declaration</v>
<v Speaker 1>of war,</v>

91
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.980
<v Speaker 1>the president has the power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>micromanage the war,</v>

92
00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:40.380
<v Speaker 1>however they want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

93
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.230
<v Speaker 1>once Congress has passed a declaration </v>
<v Speaker 1>of war,</v>

94
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.330
<v Speaker 1>the president as commander in chief has </v>
<v Speaker 1>the power to micromanage the war,</v>

95
00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.313
<v Speaker 1>however they can.</v>

96
00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:54.130
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless.</v>

97
00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>Last one is congress has passed a </v>
<v Speaker 1>declaration of war.</v>

98
00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.870
<v Speaker 1>The president is unable to micromanage </v>
<v Speaker 1>the warfare,</v>

99
00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:00.733
<v Speaker 1>the as much as he wants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means the president can give very </v>

100
00:06:02.811 --> 00:06:06.860
<v Speaker 1>specific and detailed orders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you remember the capture of Osama bin</v>

101
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.250
<v Speaker 1>Laden that was directed by President </v>
<v Speaker 1>Obama in self,</v>

102
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:12.530
<v Speaker 1>and then there they're also the many </v>
<v Speaker 1>drone strikes.</v>

103
00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:14.670
<v Speaker 1>The President Obama also watered </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

104
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.350
<v Speaker 1>Let's now move on from warfare and let's</v>
<v Speaker 1>talk a little bit about economics.</v>

105
00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the free trade agreements,</v>

106
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.400
<v Speaker 1>when it comes to the economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost all domestic policies do you have</v>

107
00:06:27.401 --> 00:06:30.610
<v Speaker 1>to go through congress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If Donald trump wants to raise taxes,</v>

108
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:31.444
<v Speaker 1>it would require a legislative votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same happens if he wants to </v>

109
00:06:34.091 --> 00:06:36.880
<v Speaker 1>liberalize one industry or nationalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>another.</v>

110
00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.773
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he might face the Supreme Court or even </v>

111
00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.043
<v Speaker 1>individual states who have their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>power to stop some actions and that's </v>

112
00:06:44.561 --> 00:06:46.780
<v Speaker 1>something we're actually going to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>covering in an upcoming video.</v>

113
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:47.643
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is an area where Donald Trump will </v>

114
00:06:49.871 --> 00:06:50.704
<v Speaker 1>have power to act.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However you want international trade </v>

115
00:06:53.441 --> 00:06:55.900
<v Speaker 1>agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is really no small matter,</v>

116
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.950
<v Speaker 1>US companies buy and sell goods and </v>
<v Speaker 1>services all over the world,</v>

117
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.903
<v Speaker 1>and these commercial relationships are </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulated through international </v>

118
00:07:03.911 --> 00:07:04.744
<v Speaker 1>agreements.</v>

119
00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:06.450
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

120
00:07:08.950 --> 00:07:09.783
<v Speaker 1>many governments have special taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are called tariffs on foreign </v>

121
00:07:12.491 --> 00:07:13.324
<v Speaker 1>goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to avoid these countries can </v>

122
00:07:14.951 --> 00:07:18.040
<v Speaker 1>sign what they call a free trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreement.</v>

123
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:18.953
<v Speaker 3>You're in North America,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we have the Nafta Treaty or the North </v>

124
00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.603
<v Speaker 3>American Free Trade Association,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which allows for forms of free trade </v>

125
00:07:25.801 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 3>between the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>

126
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.230
<v Speaker 3>and Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Now this law is 20 years old and because</v>

127
00:07:31.231 --> 00:07:32.064
<v Speaker 3>it's already on the books,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Donald Trump cannot unilaterally break </v>

128
00:07:35.521 --> 00:07:36.354
<v Speaker 3>it or change it in any major way.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You would need congress to pass a new </v>

129
00:07:40.561 --> 00:07:42.240
<v Speaker 3>law in order to make change.</v>

130
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:47.743
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're all two other big treaties that </v>

131
00:07:49.341 --> 00:07:53.600
<v Speaker 1>were negotiated by Barack Obama that are</v>
<v Speaker 1>still to be passed through congress.</v>

132
00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:57.320
<v Speaker 1>The first is the TPP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This allows a form of free trade between</v>

133
00:07:57.380 --> 00:07:58.213
<v Speaker 1>America and Asia and Oceania.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other risk of the TT ip which opens </v>

134
00:08:01.761 --> 00:08:05.180
<v Speaker 1>commerce with the European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These treaties were almost done.</v>

135
00:08:05.210 --> 00:08:06.043
<v Speaker 1>They just needed to be passed by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>American Congress as well as the </v>

136
00:08:08.631 --> 00:08:10.970
<v Speaker 1>legislative bodies of some other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>

137
00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:11.863
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American constitution says that any </v>

138
00:08:13.431 --> 00:08:14.264
<v Speaker 1>president can renegotiate or cancel any </v>
<v Speaker 1>international treaties before they have </v>

139
00:08:18.201 --> 00:08:19.034
<v Speaker 1>been voted on by Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even if they were approved by the </v>

140
00:08:22.011 --> 00:08:25.340
<v Speaker 1>legislature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could still choose not to sign it if</v>

141
00:08:25.341 --> 00:08:28.220
<v Speaker 1>he didn't sign it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be called a veto,</v>

142
00:08:28.310 --> 00:08:29.143
<v Speaker 1>and as you probably well know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump is no big fan of free trade and </v>

143
00:08:31.701 --> 00:08:32.780
<v Speaker 1>the TPP failed.</v>

144
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:33.733
<v Speaker 5>GPP is a horrible deal.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It is a deal that is going to lead to </v>

145
00:08:37.661 --> 00:08:38.494
<v Speaker 5>nothing but trouble.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's a deal that was designed for China </v>

146
00:08:41.531 --> 00:08:44.990
<v Speaker 5>to come in as they always do through the</v>
<v Speaker 5>backdoor and truck.</v>

147
00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.990
<v Speaker 5>Totally take advantage of everyone.</v>

148
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:50.670
<v Speaker 3>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the president can veto any law passed by</v>

149
00:08:50.671 --> 00:08:51.960
<v Speaker 3>Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 3>however,</v>

150
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:56.961
<v Speaker 3>he can only veto the whole law or and </v>
<v Speaker 3>send it back to Congress.</v>

151
00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:58.373
<v Speaker 3>He cannot pick and choose what parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Walgett past once it's sent back to </v>

152
00:09:02.401 --> 00:09:03.234
<v Speaker 3>Congress.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If Congress wants to pass it over the </v>

153
00:09:05.491 --> 00:09:06.324
<v Speaker 3>veto,</v>
<v Speaker 3>they would have to vote for it with a </v>

154
00:09:07.951 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 3>two thirds majority,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but of course,</v>

155
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.580
<v Speaker 1>the main area where Donald Trump would </v>
<v Speaker 1>like to use this super as presidents is</v>

156
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:20.103
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>

157
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:21.800
<v Speaker 1>This was the most hated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

158
00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:22.643
<v Speaker 1>most repeated word in donald trump's </v>
<v Speaker 1>speeches during his entire election </v>

159
00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

160
00:09:27.031 --> 00:09:30.420
<v Speaker 1>he almost has no executive powers with </v>
<v Speaker 1>which and can act on this matter</v>

161
00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:31.353
<v Speaker 3>in order to build the wall.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Trump actually needs congressional </v>

162
00:09:34.481 --> 00:09:35.314
<v Speaker 3>approval because at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>it's a major civil construction </v>

163
00:09:39.131 --> 00:09:39.964
<v Speaker 3>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 3>so it needs a budget which congress </v>

164
00:09:41.681 --> 00:09:45.160
<v Speaker 3>passes and it also needs big land </v>
<v Speaker 3>allocations,</v>

165
00:09:45.310 --> 00:09:47.860
<v Speaker 3>which he needs Congress to acquire as </v>
<v Speaker 3>well.</v>

166
00:09:47.950 --> 00:09:48.783
<v Speaker 3>If he's going to build the wall without </v>
<v Speaker 3>the permission of any other American </v>

167
00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:53.494
<v Speaker 3>institution,</v>
<v Speaker 3>he actually has to get not only Mexico </v>

168
00:09:56.441 --> 00:10:00.280
<v Speaker 3>to pay for the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but also to build the wall with in their</v>

169
00:10:00.281 --> 00:10:01.114
<v Speaker 3>own border.</v>

170
00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:04.210
<v Speaker 1>This is again something that we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to be talking about lazy</v>

171
00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.130
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American system only that's trump.</v>

172
00:10:11.131 --> 00:10:11.964
<v Speaker 1>Do one thing or to the Department of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Homeland Security to prioritize the </v>

173
00:10:15.601 --> 00:10:16.434
<v Speaker 1>deportation of illegal immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know what's particularly </v>

174
00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:21.150
<v Speaker 1>interesting about this and what the </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem is,</v>

175
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:22.980
<v Speaker 1>and that's the Boma.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

176
00:10:23.010 --> 00:10:23.843
<v Speaker 1>he already did that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Doesn't had Obama Administration so </v>

177
00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:36.460
<v Speaker 1>strange as it sounds when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal immigration.</v>

178
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:40.760
<v Speaker 1>Trump's administration is expected to </v>
<v Speaker 1>follow the steps of it promise.</v>

179
00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:44.760
<v Speaker 1>This is our opinion here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Revisional,</v>

180
00:10:44.790 --> 00:10:45.623
<v Speaker 1>politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we'd love to know what you </v>

181
00:10:46.471 --> 00:10:47.304
<v Speaker 1>think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that the president should </v>

182
00:10:48.121 --> 00:10:48.954
<v Speaker 1>be able to meet so many unilateral </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions without having to go through </v>

183
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:52.434
<v Speaker 1>Congress?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You think it's kind of scary that one </v>

184
00:10:53.701 --> 00:10:54.534
<v Speaker 1>person has the authority,</v>
<v Speaker 1>didn't nuke whatever country you'd </v>

185
