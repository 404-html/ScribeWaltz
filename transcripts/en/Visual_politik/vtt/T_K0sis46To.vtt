00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.850
<v Speaker 1>How do you measure a country's power?</v>
<v Speaker 1>By power,</v>

2
00:00:06.591 --> 00:00:10.520
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's ability to impose its will </v>
<v Speaker 1>over other countries.</v>

3
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.060
<v Speaker 1>We could measure their GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their economic growth,</v>

4
00:00:14.061 --> 00:00:17.810
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps even the size of the army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I've got another idea.</v>

5
00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:20.763
<v Speaker 1>The best way of showing your power is </v>
<v Speaker 1>forcing other countries as large as </v>

6
00:00:24.491 --> 00:00:25.324
<v Speaker 1>yours to make a big sacrifice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sacrifice might be something that </v>

7
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:29.914
<v Speaker 1>goes against their will,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that they will do it because you want </v>

8
00:00:32.861 --> 00:00:36.700
<v Speaker 1>them to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

9
00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:37.534
<v Speaker 1>this is what trump is trying to do to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union and what is the big </v>

10
00:00:42.011 --> 00:00:44.920
<v Speaker 1>sacrifice that he wants the Europeans to</v>
<v Speaker 1>make it as easy.</v>

11
00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.600
<v Speaker 1>He wants them to cut their ties with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic Republic of Iran.</v>

12
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.360
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is it really that big of a sacrifice and</v>

13
00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 1>most importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kenny,</v>

14
00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.600
<v Speaker 1>when this bat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

15
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:07.350
<v Speaker 1>these are the very questions we're going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to answer in this video.</v>

16
00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.613
<v Speaker 1>Iran is that country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've all these independent movies that </v>

17
00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say you're like,</v>

18
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:21.930
<v Speaker 1>but you've never,</v>
<v Speaker 1>never watched.</v>

19
00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.823
<v Speaker 1>Now there is something even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important to Iran's economy and that's </v>

20
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.220
<v Speaker 1>automobiles.</v>

21
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.060
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divya is,</v>

22
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.953
<v Speaker 1>Iran is actually one of the biggest con </v>
<v Speaker 1>manufacturers in all of the Middle East </v>

23
00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.750
<v Speaker 1>and I know we have probably thinking </v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

24
00:01:38.751 --> 00:01:41.990
<v Speaker 1>you're probably thinking you're on ready</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon Development,</v>

25
00:01:41.991 --> 00:01:45.500
<v Speaker 1>gumtree,</v>
<v Speaker 1>virtually isolated making cars,</v>

26
00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.980
<v Speaker 1>but as surprised as you might be,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they even have their own brands.</v>

27
00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:49.873
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the beautiful vehicle that you see here </v>

28
00:01:51.861 --> 00:01:52.694
<v Speaker 1>is the Qataris a mind.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a sedan that sells in Iran as a </v>

29
00:01:55.471 --> 00:01:57.140
<v Speaker 1>genre in Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Venezuela.</v>

30
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.741
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

31
00:01:57.741 --> 00:01:59.330
<v Speaker 1>You shouldn't have really expected </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything.</v>

32
00:01:59.331 --> 00:02:01.640
<v Speaker 1>Amazing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The engines are old and the manufacturer</v>

33
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:03.740
<v Speaker 1>does have a lot to improve,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

34
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.783
<v Speaker 1>look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what can you expect for $700 and </v>

35
00:02:11.221 --> 00:02:12.054
<v Speaker 1>seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually think that if you took this </v>

36
00:02:13.111 --> 00:02:13.944
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you improve it with a bit of modern </v>

37
00:02:14.851 --> 00:02:17.220
<v Speaker 1>technology would actually be quite a </v>
<v Speaker 1>good deal.</v>

38
00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.173
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we actually think that if you took this </v>

39
00:02:19.051 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>improved it with some modern technology,</v>

40
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.050
<v Speaker 1>it would still be cheap and it would </v>
<v Speaker 1>probably be like not a terrible vehicle.</v>

41
00:02:25.051 --> 00:02:27.450
<v Speaker 1>It would probably do really well in </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing markets.</v>

42
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.790
<v Speaker 1>And actually this is why since 2015 when</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of neurons,</v>

43
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>all sanctions were lifted,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many European companies actually started</v>

44
00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>investing in the country.</v>

45
00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.200
<v Speaker 2>Great</v>

46
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.050
<v Speaker 1>to enter new joint venture,</v>

47
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.450
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sit</v>

48
00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>back on the road and your end with deal </v>
<v Speaker 1>to build cars,</v>

49
00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.620
<v Speaker 1>but there is a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>way more than cost.</v>

50
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:53.773
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iranian stock market has a market </v>

51
00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.920
<v Speaker 1>capitalization three times bigger than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Egyptian one and they have all kinds</v>

52
00:02:59.921 --> 00:03:00.754
<v Speaker 1>of companies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Unlike other oil rich countries in the </v>

53
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:05.080
<v Speaker 1>region who runs economy is surprisingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>diversified.</v>

54
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.093
<v Speaker 1>Banks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mining companies and even telecoms all </v>

55
00:03:07.931 --> 00:03:11.140
<v Speaker 1>exist and this what is attracted other </v>
<v Speaker 1>European companies.</v>

56
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.190
<v Speaker 1>Mark's entry into Aren with high web </v>
<v Speaker 1>partnership.</v>

57
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.250
<v Speaker 1>If this wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran has a well educated population.</v>

58
00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:25.280
<v Speaker 1>The literacy rate is way higher than </v>
<v Speaker 1>that of Syria,</v>

59
00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.950
<v Speaker 1>Iraq and many of the neighboring </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

60
00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.873
<v Speaker 1>well then 4 million citizens study or </v>
<v Speaker 1>have studied at university and this </v>

61
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:36.470
<v Speaker 1>means a well trained workforce that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>work for really quite low wages.</v>

62
00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:37.363
<v Speaker 1>Add to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that the country has over 80 </v>

63
00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:39.613
<v Speaker 1>million people and some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you've actually got a really good place </v>

64
00:03:41.301 --> 00:03:42.770
<v Speaker 1>for investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

65
00:03:42.771 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 1>this wave of European money has all of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>sudden just stopped.</v>

66
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.500
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

67
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely sanctioned European companies</v>

68
00:03:56.081 --> 00:03:58.120
<v Speaker 1>that do business with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a minute.</v>

69
00:03:58.121 --> 00:03:59.110
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

70
00:03:59.111 --> 00:04:02.500
<v Speaker 1>he's the American president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He can make rules for American.</v>

71
00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:04.720
<v Speaker 1>How many he's all he wants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but European countries,</v>

72
00:04:04.721 --> 00:04:06.580
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's not the president of the world.</v>

73
00:04:06.581 --> 00:04:09.640
<v Speaker 1>How can you impose rules over countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>that he doesn't govern?</v>

74
00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.713
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is another question we're going to </v>

75
00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:13.480
<v Speaker 1>answer today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

76
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.410
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the history.</v>

77
00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.893
<v Speaker 1>Beagle dual in March,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 zed te or Chinese phone </v>

78
00:04:25.331 --> 00:04:26.164
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I had to pay a $1 billion fines of the </v>

79
00:04:29.501 --> 00:04:30.334
<v Speaker 1>united.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

80
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:35.801
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

81
00:04:35.801 --> 00:04:39.430
<v Speaker 1>they imported microchips from America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sold them to Iran.</v>

82
00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.800
<v Speaker 1>The White House basically saw this and </v>
<v Speaker 1>said,</v>

83
00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.900
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're doing business with the bad guys.</v>

84
00:04:43.901 --> 00:04:48.070
<v Speaker 1>Now you gotta pay this crazy ass fine or</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not going to let you sell your stuff</v>

85
00:04:48.071 --> 00:04:51.100
<v Speaker 1>in my country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty big deal because if you</v>

86
00:04:51.101 --> 00:04:51.934
<v Speaker 1>don't selling in America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not selling in the world's </v>

87
00:04:53.411 --> 00:04:55.660
<v Speaker 1>richest country ever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really not an option.</v>

88
00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 1>So he was willing to pay pretty much </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything in order to stay in the market.</v>

89
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:01.473
<v Speaker 1>And well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this same thing is happening with many </v>

90
00:05:03.821 --> 00:05:04.350
<v Speaker 1>other company.</v>

91
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:05.183
<v Speaker 2>Nice.</v>

92
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.953
<v Speaker 1>But as we said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>European companies started doing </v>

93
00:05:10.431 --> 00:05:15.431
<v Speaker 1>business with Iran in 2015 and we're not</v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about buying oil here,</v>

94
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.140
<v Speaker 1>but investments of all kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why as soon as trump pasta,</v>

95
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.890
<v Speaker 1>new sanctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the EU</v>

96
00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.620
<v Speaker 2>for oxygen Europe</v>

97
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:26.453
<v Speaker 1>requests exemptions from trump's Iran </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctions for energy aviation and more </v>

98
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:34.940
<v Speaker 1>basically European leaders wrote a </v>
<v Speaker 1>letter to the White House asking America</v>

99
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 1>to respect to their economic interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

100
00:05:38.041 --> 00:05:39.990
<v Speaker 1>trump isn't a big fan of the European </v>
<v Speaker 1>Union,</v>

101
00:05:39.991 --> 00:05:44.991
<v Speaker 1>so you can imagine is onset.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why in 2018 the European Union,</v>

102
00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:49.770
<v Speaker 1>so big action,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was time for regulation two two seven</v>

103
00:05:49.771 --> 00:05:50.604
<v Speaker 1>one slash nine six oh wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't know what regulation two two </v>

104
00:05:53.731 --> 00:05:55.860
<v Speaker 1>seven one slash nine six is all about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

105
00:05:55.861 --> 00:05:56.880
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No problem.</v>

106
00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:02.020
<v Speaker 1>That's why I'm here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see regulation d two seven one slash</v>

107
00:06:04.271 --> 00:06:08.200
<v Speaker 1>nine six is something like a legal </v>
<v Speaker 1>shield against trade wars.</v>

108
00:06:08.201 --> 00:06:09.034
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say this Chevrolet discovers that </v>

109
00:06:10.611 --> 00:06:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Aramco has a factory on Iranian soil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They could take the French company to an</v>

110
00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:17.470
<v Speaker 1>American court and to make them pay a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fine,</v>

111
00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:18.603
<v Speaker 1>but at that same moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union would impose an </v>

112
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:21.544
<v Speaker 1>equivalent fine on Chevrolet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is still not the end of the </v>

113
00:06:25.301 --> 00:06:30.301
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then suppose Renner says,</v>

114
00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:32.553
<v Speaker 1>hm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well then I'm going to leave Iran </v>

115
00:06:33.390 --> 00:06:34.950
<v Speaker 1>anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's too much trouble that,</v>

116
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in that case,</v>

117
00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:36.733
<v Speaker 1>the European Union could also find the </v>
<v Speaker 1>company because technically they are </v>

118
00:06:38.881 --> 00:06:41.220
<v Speaker 1>complying with Washington's sanction.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

119
00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.183
<v Speaker 1>Say basically all wraps up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This basically means that all the </v>

120
00:06:48.351 --> 00:06:52.670
<v Speaker 1>companies doing business with Iran are </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of screwed if they stay.</v>

121
00:06:52.671 --> 00:06:53.504
<v Speaker 1>Washington screws them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they leave the European Union screws </v>

122
00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:56.963
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's sort of a really big lose lose and </v>

123
00:06:58.881 --> 00:07:02.540
<v Speaker 1>it's what's known as a political deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is now,</v>

124
00:07:02.541 --> 00:07:03.374
<v Speaker 1>who is more powerful?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who would the European companies prefer </v>

125
00:07:05.241 --> 00:07:07.100
<v Speaker 1>to get screwed by?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.503
<v Speaker 1>now we're going to see you.</v>

127
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:15.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

128
00:07:15.880 --> 00:07:16.713
<v Speaker 1>the check.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure all of you have made an </v>

129
00:07:18.401 --> 00:07:19.234
<v Speaker 1>international transfer at some point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say you live in Canada and you </v>

130
00:07:22.421 --> 00:07:24.280
<v Speaker 1>need to be paid by an Australian </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

131
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:25.143
<v Speaker 1>When you send the invoice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you don't give you normal bank details </v>

132
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:29.710
<v Speaker 1>like you'd give to a company in your </v>
<v Speaker 1>country instead of your gift.</v>

133
00:07:29.711 --> 00:07:32.110
<v Speaker 1>This really long number that also has </v>
<v Speaker 1>some letters in it.</v>

134
00:07:32.111 --> 00:07:33.460
<v Speaker 1>Look,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this.</v>

135
00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:42.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

136
00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:45.090
<v Speaker 1>Lee's letters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the so called swift.</v>

137
00:07:45.091 --> 00:07:45.924
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

138
00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:52.760
<v Speaker 3>Which system is what banks used for </v>
<v Speaker 3>international money transfers.</v>

139
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.820
<v Speaker 3>It is a network that connects all of the</v>
<v Speaker 3>world's banks.</v>

140
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.480
<v Speaker 3>A number of years around was </v>
<v Speaker 3>disconnected from the swift network,</v>

141
00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:02.900
<v Speaker 3>so this means that even if you wanted to</v>
<v Speaker 3>do business with Iran,</v>

142
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:04.023
<v Speaker 3>he just couldn't,</v>

143
00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:09.830
<v Speaker 2>after all,</v>

144
00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:10.853
<v Speaker 1>how can you conduct business with </v>
<v Speaker 1>somebody you can't even transfer money </v>

145
00:08:13.561 --> 00:08:14.820
<v Speaker 1>to?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

146
00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.410
<v Speaker 1>could send money in a briefcase,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not very convenient.</v>

147
00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 1>In 2015 when that nuclear deal was </v>
<v Speaker 1>signed,</v>

148
00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.520
<v Speaker 1>Iran returned to the swift system and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was the moment.</v>

149
00:08:26.521 --> 00:08:27.354
<v Speaker 1>This was the moment when,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ron could go back to the </v>

150
00:08:28.861 --> 00:08:30.960
<v Speaker 1>international business scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you might be wondering,</v>

151
00:08:30.961 --> 00:08:33.060
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who controls the swift system?</v>

152
00:08:33.210 --> 00:08:33.961
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

153
00:08:33.961 --> 00:08:34.890
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You guessed it.</v>

154
00:08:35.100 --> 00:08:35.933
<v Speaker 1>It's of course a company called swift,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Society for worldwide into bank </v>

155
00:08:39.031 --> 00:08:42.720
<v Speaker 1>financial transactions and guests where </v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the headquarters.</v>

156
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:44.580
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's in Brussels.</v>

157
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:45.563
<v Speaker 1>So yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I probably know what you're now </v>

158
00:08:46.411 --> 00:08:47.244
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're thinking if all of the </v>

159
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:50.030
<v Speaker 1>international transactions and managed </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a euro,</v>

160
00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.150
<v Speaker 1>then America doesn't have to do much to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid doing business with Iran,</v>

161
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:55.320
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

162
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:56.310
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not right at all.</v>

163
00:08:56.311 --> 00:08:57.150
<v Speaker 1>Very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very wrong.</v>

164
00:08:57.151 --> 00:09:00.060
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>swift is actually a cooperative society.</v>

165
00:09:00.061 --> 00:09:00.894
<v Speaker 1>This means all the important decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>made by a board of managers with 25 </v>

166
00:09:04.231 --> 00:09:06.750
<v Speaker 1>representatives from the most important.</v>

167
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.693
<v Speaker 2>Thanks</v>

168
00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:14.150
<v Speaker 1>side of this board of managers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are two Americans.</v>

169
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:17.840
<v Speaker 1>One is from Citibank and another is from</v>
<v Speaker 1>jp Morgan Chase.</v>

170
00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Two representatives will have to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy fines if they can't convince their</v>

171
00:09:25.311 --> 00:09:27.800
<v Speaker 1>colleagues to disconnect Iran from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>swift system.</v>

172
00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:28.963
<v Speaker 1>If this happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran would be isolated from the </v>

173
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:32.840
<v Speaker 1>international market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you can't make transactions,</v>

174
00:09:32.841 --> 00:09:35.270
<v Speaker 1>you can't do business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really just that simple.</v>

175
00:09:35.430 --> 00:09:36.263
<v Speaker 1>This is such an important matter that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the European Union is already trying to </v>

176
00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:42.280
<v Speaker 1>come up with an alternative system for </v>
<v Speaker 1>international transactions.</v>

177
00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.720
<v Speaker 1>Something like a modern day barter </v>
<v Speaker 1>system.</v>

178
00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:48.020
<v Speaker 1>They call it spv or special purpose </v>
<v Speaker 1>vehicle.</v>

179
00:09:48.021 --> 00:09:50.570
<v Speaker 1>The idea is that instead of exchanging </v>
<v Speaker 1>goods for money,</v>

180
00:09:50.690 --> 00:09:53.600
<v Speaker 1>Europe wants to pay with credits for </v>
<v Speaker 1>other goods.</v>

181
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:54.613
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say that Repsol a Spanish company </v>

182
00:09:56.511 --> 00:09:58.490
<v Speaker 1>wants to buy oil from Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

183
00:09:58.700 --> 00:09:59.533
<v Speaker 1>instead of paying with cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could pay with an equivalent some </v>

184
00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.923
<v Speaker 1>machinery.</v>

185
00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:09.350
<v Speaker 4>Wow.</v>

186
00:10:09.350 --> 00:10:10.161
<v Speaker 1>So now you might,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're on you.</v>

187
00:10:10.161 --> 00:10:10.994
<v Speaker 1>Well we got rid of the boss system </v>
<v Speaker 1>really long time ago cause something </v>

188
00:10:12.741 --> 00:10:15.020
<v Speaker 1>like this really work today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:10:15.021 --> 00:10:17.690
<v Speaker 1>the answer is or any time is going to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>able to tell,</v>

190
00:10:17.691 --> 00:10:18.524
<v Speaker 1>but let's assume that it actually does.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's say the companies started using </v>

191
00:10:22.371 --> 00:10:26.090
<v Speaker 1>this spv system to trade with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get back to our reps.</v>

192
00:10:26.091 --> 00:10:29.060
<v Speaker 1>Will example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This dinosaur juice they just bought has</v>

193
00:10:29.061 --> 00:10:30.230
<v Speaker 1>to arrive somehow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

194
00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.183
<v Speaker 1>Somehow somebody has to put it on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tanker and take it into Barcelona's </v>

195
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:35.233
<v Speaker 1>harbor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

196
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.073
<v Speaker 1>most of the old hangars isn't on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet then managed by a Danish company </v>

197
00:10:38.721 --> 00:10:41.570
<v Speaker 1>called nurse Gif and Denmark.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well that's in Europe,</v>

198
00:10:41.571 --> 00:10:44.950
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No harbor is going to accept an oil ship</v>

199
00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:45.813
<v Speaker 1>if it's not insured.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it turns out most of the insurance </v>

200
00:10:47.871 --> 00:10:48.704
<v Speaker 1>company is work with oil tankers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>American or have a lot of interest in </v>

201
00:10:52.791 --> 00:10:56.270
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which explains news like this.</v>

202
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:03.180
<v Speaker 2>Shipping</v>

203
00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:07.440
<v Speaker 1>giant Marishka to abandoned Iran as </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat of sanctions grows.</v>

204
00:11:07.590 --> 00:11:09.960
<v Speaker 1>Other countries like China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they already found alternatives.</v>

205
00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:10.943
<v Speaker 1>They have enough at stake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you convinced them to do everything </v>

206
00:11:12.931 --> 00:11:15.360
<v Speaker 1>they can to keep oil suppliers coming in</v>
<v Speaker 1>from Iran.</v>

207
00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:16.433
<v Speaker 1>It's their sixth biggest providers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>7% of their dynoed juice comes from </v>

208
00:11:20.161 --> 00:11:21.850
<v Speaker 1>Tehran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Europe.</v>

209
00:11:22.190 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>Europe is a different animal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In that case,</v>

210
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:26.880
<v Speaker 1>Iran isn't important enough to risk so </v>
<v Speaker 1>much on this.</v>

211
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.070
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you're up wanted to keep buying crude</v>

212
00:11:29.071 --> 00:11:29.904
<v Speaker 1>all from Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have to find one new </v>

213
00:11:31.531 --> 00:11:35.700
<v Speaker 1>transport companies to new insurance </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies and three,</v>

214
00:11:35.790 --> 00:11:37.890
<v Speaker 1>they would have to use bartering.</v>

215
00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:43.163
<v Speaker 5>Yeah,</v>

216
00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:46.470
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I look at anything is really possible,</v>

217
00:11:46.471 --> 00:11:47.304
<v Speaker 1>but so far it does seem that America and</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is gonna win this match </v>

218
00:11:50.701 --> 00:11:51.534
<v Speaker 1>against the European Union and all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this has got a whole bunch of </v>

219
00:11:54.311 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In a previous video,</v>

220
00:11:56.111 --> 00:11:56.944
<v Speaker 1>we talked about what's happening with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the international all markets in the </v>

221
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:01.023
<v Speaker 1>following weeks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to talk about what's going to </v>

222
00:12:01.361 --> 00:12:03.790
<v Speaker 1>happen to the Uranian regime.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

223
00:12:03.791 --> 00:12:07.840
<v Speaker 1>the big question is can be sanctions and</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Iranian regime.</v>

224
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:08.703
<v Speaker 1>How much can all prices go up?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can write me your theories and in </v>

225
00:12:11.111 --> 00:12:11.944
<v Speaker 1>the following days,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look and see if they match </v>

226
00:12:13.491 --> 00:12:14.740
<v Speaker 1>with ours.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the meantime,</v>

227
00:12:14.741 --> 00:12:15.574
<v Speaker 1>do you visit reconsider media?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the podcast that provided the </v>

228
00:12:17.291 --> 00:12:19.180
<v Speaker 1>vocals in this episode that were not </v>
<v Speaker 1>mine.</v>
