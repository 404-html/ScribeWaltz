1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:00.883
<v Speaker 1>More than 250 million people live in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country other than the one they were </v>

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:06.240
<v Speaker 1>born in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.970
<v Speaker 1>they're immigrants and if you at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>number,</v>

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.030
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't stop growing in the last 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

5
00:00:17.661 --> 00:00:18.494
<v Speaker 1>It just multiplied by three and only </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the year 2000 is the number of </v>

6
00:00:21.111 --> 00:00:21.944
<v Speaker 1>immigrants has increased by 80 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's 18 million more people who've </v>

7
00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.060
<v Speaker 1>left their country in search of a better</v>
<v Speaker 1>life.</v>

8
00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.360
<v Speaker 1>We are the dreamers of USA and as you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can imagine,</v>

9
00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:37.084
<v Speaker 1>most of the world's immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 65% of settles in the richest </v>

10
00:00:40.661 --> 00:00:43.210
<v Speaker 1>countries such as the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>

11
00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.680
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Canada.</v>

12
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:51.410
<v Speaker 2>I do</v>

13
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.243
<v Speaker 1>this precisely at this fact that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>feeding all over the world </v>

14
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>controversial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>furious,</v>

15
00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.653
<v Speaker 1>and bitter debates on immigration and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the discourse of many populist movement </v>

16
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.253
<v Speaker 1>in recent years in Europe for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've seen a lot of populist and Zena </v>

17
00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.174
<v Speaker 1>phobic parties and merging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which have targeted immigration </v>

18
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.380
<v Speaker 1>directly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've certainly heard it all.</v>

19
00:01:17.661 --> 00:01:20.150
<v Speaker 1>What if they steal our jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>put us in danger,</v>

20
00:01:20.151 --> 00:01:22.880
<v Speaker 1>destroy on national identity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

21
00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:23.990
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

22
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.820
<v Speaker 1>That's perhaps the most outstanding case</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of this is Donald Trump.</v>

23
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.700
<v Speaker 1>He's made it very clear,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but he is a president who really doesn't</v>

24
00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:36.380
<v Speaker 1>like immigration except you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>under really certain circumstances,</v>

25
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.473
<v Speaker 3>trump balked at an immigration deal that</v>
<v Speaker 3>would include protections for people </v>

26
00:01:41.331 --> 00:01:42.164
<v Speaker 3>from Haiti and some nations in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Demand to know why he should accept </v>

27
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.610
<v Speaker 3>immigrants from quote whole countries </v>
<v Speaker 3>rather than from places like</v>

28
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:51.513
<v Speaker 1>Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why on earth would trump think that </v>

29
00:01:52.871 --> 00:01:53.704
<v Speaker 1>Norwegians once it emigrate on master </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States when they are already </v>

30
00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.590
<v Speaker 1>rich Americans?</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

31
00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.730
<v Speaker 1>more people are moving from the u s to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway and the other way around.</v>

32
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.593
<v Speaker 1>But let us not straight too far from </v>
<v Speaker 1>today's topic because what we're really </v>

33
00:02:07.631 --> 00:02:10.780
<v Speaker 1>looking at today is whether immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>is actually a danger.</v>

34
00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:11.643
<v Speaker 1>Is it a burden on society?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to look at whether the United </v>

35
00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.083
<v Speaker 1>States is losing economic and momentum </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of all the immigrants that are </v>

36
00:02:18.941 --> 00:02:21.820
<v Speaker 1>coming into the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to look at whether the US should</v>

37
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:25.340
<v Speaker 1>stop the arrival of more foreigners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that's,</v>

38
00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:26.213
<v Speaker 1>that's in,</v>

39
00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.893
<v Speaker 2>okay.</v>

40
00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:36.003
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if there is one thing that we can all </v>

41
00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:38.554
<v Speaker 1>agree on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's that we live in an increasingly </v>

42
00:02:40.031 --> 00:02:43.420
<v Speaker 1>interconnected world that is a world </v>
<v Speaker 1>where it's becoming easier,</v>

43
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.940
<v Speaker 1>faster and cheaper to go from one place </v>
<v Speaker 1>to another.</v>

44
00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.630
<v Speaker 2>And there's also</v>

45
00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.590
<v Speaker 1>a world where it's easier to connect </v>
<v Speaker 1>with our loved ones where they are.</v>

46
00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:57.860
<v Speaker 1>And as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things make the decision to</v>

47
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.340
<v Speaker 1>pack up and move to another country </v>
<v Speaker 1>much,</v>

48
00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.233
<v Speaker 1>much easier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's why if there were 90 million </v>

49
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:05.680
<v Speaker 1>immigrants around the world in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sixties today,</v>

50
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.800
<v Speaker 1>there are more than 250 million.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And you know what?</v>

51
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.370
<v Speaker 1>We can only expect this number to grow </v>
<v Speaker 1>strongly in the upcoming years first.</v>

52
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.204
<v Speaker 1>It's because it's becoming easier to </v>
<v Speaker 1>move into seconds because of the huge </v>

53
00:03:21.881 --> 00:03:25.510
<v Speaker 1>demographic growth that many poor </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries are experiencing.</v>

54
00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:26.381
<v Speaker 1>So Devi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you are,</v>

55
00:03:26.381 --> 00:03:28.870
<v Speaker 1>the real question that we want to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>back to is,</v>

56
00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.060
<v Speaker 1>is there a reason to worry?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

57
00:03:31.061 --> 00:03:31.894
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>

58
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

59
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:45.563
<v Speaker 1>a lucky break.</v>

60
00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:48.210
<v Speaker 2>Whenever</v>

61
00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:49.043
<v Speaker 1>rich countries talk about immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like that debating whether or </v>

62
00:03:51.811 --> 00:03:55.980
<v Speaker 1>not to engage in some sort of charity </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then you know what's,</v>

63
00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.320
<v Speaker 1>nothing could actually be further from </v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth.</v>

64
00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Hair,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration favors economic growth among</v>

65
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:06.290
<v Speaker 1>other things because most immigrants are</v>
<v Speaker 1>adults of working age four.</v>

66
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.823
<v Speaker 1>It's been calculated that since the year</v>
<v Speaker 1>2000 immigrants who have been </v>

67
00:04:09.931 --> 00:04:14.370
<v Speaker 1>responsible for 40 to 80% of their main </v>
<v Speaker 1>recipients,</v>

68
00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:17.610
<v Speaker 1>country's workforce growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's be honest,</v>

69
00:04:17.611 --> 00:04:19.230
<v Speaker 1>without them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these countries,</v>

70
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.000
<v Speaker 1>that'd be far less wealthy.</v>

71
00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:22.730
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

72
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.390
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know this is all very abstract.</v>

73
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:27.253
<v Speaker 1>If you want to see exactly how this </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens in one of the countries where </v>

74
00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:31.490
<v Speaker 1>immigration has caused a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>controversy.</v>

75
00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:32.353
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look at the United Kingdom </v>

76
00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.223
<v Speaker 1>recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while some political groups warns about </v>

77
00:04:38.721 --> 00:04:39.554
<v Speaker 1>the enormous threats that immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>and including immigrants coming from </v>

78
00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:44.720
<v Speaker 1>other European countries posed for </v>
<v Speaker 1>British jobs,</v>

79
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:48.350
<v Speaker 1>identity and his way of life.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that the economy has placed</v>

80
00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.740
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very different numbers on the team.</v>

81
00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:55.493
<v Speaker 1>Never before in history of so many </v>
<v Speaker 1>people being employed in the United </v>

82
00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom as there are today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>neither in absolute or relative terms</v>

83
00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:11.960
<v Speaker 2>I did,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it</v>

84
00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.810
<v Speaker 1>doesn't even matter if we exclude </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>

85
00:05:14.811 --> 00:05:15.644
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Never before as the British population </v>

86
00:05:17.001 --> 00:05:20.180
<v Speaker 1>had as many job opportunities as they do</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now,</v>

87
00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:23.053
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's according to studies from several </v>

88
00:05:24.741 --> 00:05:28.010
<v Speaker 1>British universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these immigrants pay more taxes than</v>

89
00:05:28.011 --> 00:05:30.980
<v Speaker 1>they get in benefits from the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that weren't enough,</v>

90
00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.843
<v Speaker 1>the UK is managing to attract more </v>
<v Speaker 1>university immigrants than any other </v>

91
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.130
<v Speaker 1>European country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

92
00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:44.090
<v Speaker 1>the effect of this immigration is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very positive for the British,</v>

93
00:05:44.091 --> 00:05:48.500
<v Speaker 1>and it's also helping turn the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kingdom into a technological powerhouse.</v>

94
00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.820
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

95
00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:50.510
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know what,</v>

96
00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:53.690
<v Speaker 1>despite trump's fiery speeches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is there's,</v>

97
00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.810
<v Speaker 1>on the other side of the ponds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things aren't really any,</v>

98
00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.190
<v Speaker 1>listen to this.</v>

99
00:05:58.190 --> 00:05:59.023
<v Speaker 4>I remember</v>

100
00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the North American dream</v>

101
00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:11.240
<v Speaker 4>okay.</v>

102
00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.073
<v Speaker 1>With just over 44 million people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is more or less the population of </v>

103
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:18.020
<v Speaker 1>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The United States is in absolute terms.</v>

104
00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.050
<v Speaker 1>The country with the most immigrants in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

105
00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.923
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait just a moment because in relative </v>

106
00:06:29.281 --> 00:06:31.140
<v Speaker 1>terms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are rather difference.</v>

107
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:36.200
<v Speaker 1>These 44 million people represents just </v>
<v Speaker 1>under 14% of the entire population.</v>

108
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.453
<v Speaker 1>To give you a better idea here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in countries like Australia or New </v>

109
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Zealand for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage is almost twice as high.</v>

110
00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>Now here is a big question for you and </v>
<v Speaker 1>please don't cheat in Google.</v>

111
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:55.013
<v Speaker 1>That's what impact do you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration has had on the United </v>

112
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.840
<v Speaker 1>States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

113
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.673
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer listener,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite representing just under 14% of </v>

114
00:07:03.821 --> 00:07:04.654
<v Speaker 1>the population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants are responsible for almost </v>

115
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.970
<v Speaker 1>25% of all businesses that have you been</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

116
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.833
<v Speaker 1>They're also responsible for more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>30% of the companies in which venture </v>

117
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:14.404
<v Speaker 1>capital funds invest as almost half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all silicon valley high tech startups </v>

118
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.810
<v Speaker 1>are started by immigrants and that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>normal here.</v>

119
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:25.550
<v Speaker 1>According to a study from the Center for</v>
<v Speaker 1>American entrepreneurship,</v>

120
00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.433
<v Speaker 1>43% of the 500 largest companies in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States were founded either by </v>

121
00:07:30.790 --> 00:07:33.130
<v Speaker 1>immigrants or the children of </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>

122
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.640
<v Speaker 2>Three weeks ago we bought another toward</v>
<v Speaker 2>the new low price custom line.</v>

123
00:07:40.641 --> 00:07:41.474
<v Speaker 2>Victoria,</v>

124
00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:49.920
<v Speaker 1>that's 216 companies whose revenues </v>
<v Speaker 1>surpass it.</v>

125
00:07:49.950 --> 00:07:50.783
<v Speaker 1>$5 trillion every year and employee </v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 13 million people all around the </v>

126
00:07:55.201 --> 00:07:56.034
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

127
00:07:58.490 --> 00:07:58.890
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:03.890
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about nearly half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great us economic powerhouse from Henry,</v>

129
00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:07.860
<v Speaker 1>forced to Elon Musk and many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>great figures and iconic characters over</v>

130
00:08:07.861 --> 00:08:11.220
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They weren't even born in that country.</v>

131
00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:17.493
<v Speaker 2>No.</v>

132
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:18.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a,</v>

133
00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:21.000
<v Speaker 1>because I bet something you are probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>

134
00:08:21.001 --> 00:08:21.990
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>okay Simon,</v>

135
00:08:21.991 --> 00:08:26.100
<v Speaker 1>but those are only a few immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most educated ones.</v>

136
00:08:26.430 --> 00:08:28.170
<v Speaker 1>What about all of the rest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon?</v>

137
00:08:29.390 --> 00:08:29.730
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

138
00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:32.940
<v Speaker 1>well the truth is the numbers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't very much here either.</v>

139
00:08:32.970 --> 00:08:35.160
<v Speaker 1>That entrepreneurship and employment </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates,</v>

140
00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:36.023
<v Speaker 1>they're also really high and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also provide several other </v>

141
00:08:38.641 --> 00:08:39.750
<v Speaker 1>benefits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

142
00:08:39.751 --> 00:08:42.480
<v Speaker 1>in a country that at the moment has </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much full employment.</v>

143
00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:45.540
<v Speaker 1>New immigrants reinforce the U S is </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness,</v>

144
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:48.920
<v Speaker 1>encourage the rest of the American </v>
<v Speaker 1>population to do more as an alpha.</v>

145
00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:52.170
<v Speaker 1>Many businesses that would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>otherwise not existed to be creative.</v>

146
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.263
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integralist reduce the populations </v>

147
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:01.530
<v Speaker 1>average age.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have more children or more educated</v>

148
00:09:01.531 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>and is more enterprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They far more patterns as well.</v>

149
00:09:04.590 --> 00:09:06.960
<v Speaker 1>The list goes on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you think about it for a second,</v>

150
00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:09.260
<v Speaker 1>it does make a lot of sense on the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>am's.</v>

151
00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:12.060
<v Speaker 1>These people arrived,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you achieve a better future.</v>

152
00:09:12.061 --> 00:09:15.000
<v Speaker 1>So they're willing to take risks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>work really hard.</v>

153
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:16.190
<v Speaker 1>No.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hands,</v>

154
00:09:16.230 --> 00:09:17.063
<v Speaker 1>they've had different experiences and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's education and they can take </v>

155
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.800
<v Speaker 1>advantage of this in order to progress </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

156
00:09:22.801 --> 00:09:23.634
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Italian pizzas aren't Mexican tacos </v>

157
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>that flood for us today as well as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the wells.</v>

158
00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.423
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite these arguments and the facts </v>

159
00:09:31.051 --> 00:09:31.884
<v Speaker 1>that never before have so many Americans</v>
<v Speaker 1>had jobs as politicians like Donald </v>

160
00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:38.580
<v Speaker 1>Trump still don't like immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But you know what?</v>

161
00:09:38.581 --> 00:09:39.414
<v Speaker 1>This isn't the first time that the u s </v>
<v Speaker 1>political leaders have spoken out </v>

162
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:42.864
<v Speaker 1>against immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has become the issue and the </v>

163
00:09:44.551 --> 00:09:46.260
<v Speaker 1>governor's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pete Wilson,</v>

164
00:09:46.261 --> 00:09:50.130
<v Speaker 1>a one 87 supporter,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is pinning his reelection hopes on Eddie</v>

165
00:09:50.131 --> 00:09:50.964
<v Speaker 1>immigrants.</v>

166
00:09:56.950 --> 00:09:57.820
<v Speaker 2>The precedents.</v>

167
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.890
<v Speaker 1>This is by no means that the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

168
00:10:03.891 --> 00:10:04.724
<v Speaker 1>the country of immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has had political campaigns against </v>

169
00:10:07.311 --> 00:10:08.144
<v Speaker 1>them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see in the middle of the 19th </v>

170
00:10:08.931 --> 00:10:10.250
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the political movement,</v>

171
00:10:10.310 --> 00:10:11.143
<v Speaker 1>no and nothing opposed immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>particularly from the Irish and soon </v>

172
00:10:14.691 --> 00:10:16.850
<v Speaker 1>after if they focused on the Chinese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

173
00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.710
<v Speaker 1>You heard that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

174
00:10:17.710 --> 00:10:19.520
<v Speaker 1>They,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're focusing on the Chinese.</v>

175
00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:23.300
<v Speaker 1>During the second half of the 19th </v>
<v Speaker 1>century,</v>

176
00:10:23.301 --> 00:10:24.134
<v Speaker 1>many of Chinese came to the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States and that triggered a rather </v>

177
00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.220
<v Speaker 1>hostile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>popular reaction.</v>

178
00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:33.690
<v Speaker 3>Seattle to Los Angeles from Wyoming to </v>
<v Speaker 3>the small towns of California.</v>

179
00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:36.630
<v Speaker 3>Immigrants from China were forced out of</v>
<v Speaker 3>business,</v>

180
00:10:36.690 --> 00:10:38.310
<v Speaker 3>run out of town,</v>
<v Speaker 3>beaten,</v>

181
00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.690
<v Speaker 3>tortured,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lynched,</v>

182
00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:43.050
<v Speaker 3>and massacred usually with little hope </v>
<v Speaker 3>of help from the law.</v>

183
00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:46.080
<v Speaker 3>Immigration work from the library of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Congress,</v>

184
00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:47.083
<v Speaker 1>all this because at that time Americans </v>
<v Speaker 1>saw the Chinese as the competition ends </v>

185
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:52.843
<v Speaker 1>in 1982 the federal congress itself a </v>
<v Speaker 1>preview to the law of exclusion of the </v>

186
00:10:56.481 --> 00:10:57.314
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which not only suspended the arrival of </v>

187
00:10:59.211 --> 00:11:00.044
<v Speaker 1>new Chinese immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also it made the lives of those who </v>

188
00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:07.241
<v Speaker 1>were already in the u s Rafa complicated</v>
<v Speaker 1>and bottles and home.</v>

189
00:11:07.430 --> 00:11:08.263
<v Speaker 1>In 1924 after around 30 million people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who have crossed the Atlantic Ocean to </v>

190
00:11:11.271 --> 00:11:13.520
<v Speaker 1>reach the u s Washington established a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quote,</v>

191
00:11:13.521 --> 00:11:17.270
<v Speaker 1>a policy that greatly reduced the number</v>
<v Speaker 1>of immigrants that could arrive and they</v>

192
00:11:17.271 --> 00:11:18.104
<v Speaker 1>also vetoed immigrants from southern </v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe such as Spain and Italy as well </v>

193
00:11:20.571 --> 00:11:21.680
<v Speaker 1>as Eastern Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>

194
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.470
<v Speaker 1>and Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So basically the few who it ends or they</v>

195
00:11:24.471 --> 00:11:26.120
<v Speaker 1>have to be Anglo saxons.</v>

196
00:11:30.710 --> 00:11:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more</v>

197
00:11:31.110 --> 00:11:34.020
<v Speaker 1>recently in 1994 the then governor of </v>
<v Speaker 1>California,</v>

198
00:11:34.021 --> 00:11:34.854
<v Speaker 1>Pete Wilson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blamed Hispanic immigrants for the </v>

199
00:11:36.251 --> 00:11:39.750
<v Speaker 1>state's poor economic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you want to know what he did?</v>

200
00:11:39.780 --> 00:11:40.613
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he launched a huge political campaign </v>

201
00:11:42.331 --> 00:11:43.164
<v Speaker 1>against immigration and pushed the so </v>
<v Speaker 1>called a proposition one eight seven a </v>

202
00:11:46.381 --> 00:11:51.000
<v Speaker 1>law that prevented access to social,</v>
<v Speaker 1>educational and even health services for</v>

203
00:11:51.001 --> 00:11:53.440
<v Speaker 1>all illegal immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

204
00:11:53.441 --> 00:11:54.274
<v Speaker 1>this included children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so aggressive that just a year </v>

205
00:11:57.370 --> 00:12:00.040
<v Speaker 1>later the supreme court declared it </v>
<v Speaker 1>unconstitutional.</v>

206
00:12:00.220 --> 00:12:01.053
<v Speaker 5>We are going to think back California </v>
<v Speaker 5>working tax paying families of this </v>

207
00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:07.814
<v Speaker 5>state.</v>

208
00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:10.743
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that despite all these </v>

209
00:12:11.951 --> 00:12:12.784
<v Speaker 1>campaigns against immigration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>existing research shows that states and </v>

210
00:12:15.791 --> 00:12:20.050
<v Speaker 1>counties that historically had more </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration now have a higher income,</v>

211
00:12:20.110 --> 00:12:23.290
<v Speaker 1>less poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less unemployment and better educational</v>

212
00:12:23.291 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 1>results does that with all this data in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mind,</v>

213
00:12:25.211 --> 00:12:27.450
<v Speaker 1>it might be good for both the White </v>
<v Speaker 1>House and the capitol.</v>

214
00:12:27.451 --> 00:12:29.590
<v Speaker 1>It's a focus less on how to deport </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

215
00:12:29.591 --> 00:12:30.424
<v Speaker 1>funds more on how to use strength and </v>
<v Speaker 1>access and Tracy to prove once and for </v>

216
00:12:33.341 --> 00:12:33.920
<v Speaker 1>all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

217
00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:38.080
<v Speaker 1>migrator reform that facilitates the </v>
<v Speaker 1>orderly arrival of more people,</v>

218
00:12:38.110 --> 00:12:41.050
<v Speaker 1>more workers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more entrepreneurs and more researches.</v>

219
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.020
<v Speaker 1>All of this would great and the age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the North American economy,</v>

225
00:12:56.831 --> 00:12:59.470
<v Speaker 1>the entry of immigrants or should they </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase it?</v>
