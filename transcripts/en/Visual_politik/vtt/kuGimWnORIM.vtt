1
00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.560
<v Speaker 1>I'm going to stop this episode with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and please don't treat him.</v>

2
00:00:11.561 --> 00:00:12.394
<v Speaker 1>Please don't Google the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the country with the biggest </v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:18.490
<v Speaker 1>chance of female politicians insight </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's parliaments.</v>

4
00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.900
<v Speaker 1>It might be thinking right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>

5
00:00:19.901 --> 00:00:21.550
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Great Britain.</v>

6
00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:22.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if that's the case,</v>

7
00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.910
<v Speaker 1>your thinking is wrong because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

8
00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:25.773
<v Speaker 1>it's actually Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the poorest places in Subsaharan </v>

9
00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.943
<v Speaker 1>Africa.</v>

10
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.400
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure many of you already know this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

11
00:00:34.401 --> 00:00:36.720
<v Speaker 1>yet least those of you who are as old as</v>
<v Speaker 1>me,</v>

12
00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.660
<v Speaker 1>because in the end of 1994,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rwandan genocide,</v>

13
00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.570
<v Speaker 1>it appears on every news station around </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world.</v>

14
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.400
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the biggest atrocities in </v>
<v Speaker 1>mankind's history in just 100 days.</v>

15
00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:50.520
<v Speaker 1>There are ones in governments brutally </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed almost a million people.</v>

16
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.750
<v Speaker 1>This meant that every one in five </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rwandans was murdered for decades.</v>

17
00:00:54.751 --> 00:00:55.584
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the synonym for humanitarian </v>

18
00:00:57.001 --> 00:00:58.620
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>starvation,</v>

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.070
<v Speaker 1>and it was a memory of the darkest side </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the human condition.</v>

20
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.320
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 years later in the year,</v>

21
00:01:04.321 --> 00:01:05.154
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda is turning into something much </v>

22
00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:08.694
<v Speaker 1>difference</v>

23
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.960
<v Speaker 1>is from Rwanda investing in one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's fastest growing economies.</v>

24
00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.370
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that rides,</v>

25
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda is becoming a hot topic in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>financial world,</v>

26
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.510
<v Speaker 1>a country that used to appear on </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian aid commercials.</v>

27
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.463
<v Speaker 1>Now he's starting to fill financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>newspapers and it's President Paul </v>

28
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.583
<v Speaker 1>Kagame has become the new African </v>
<v Speaker 1>rockstar being received a prestigious </v>

29
00:01:31.581 --> 00:01:34.310
<v Speaker 1>places like Harvard or the Brookings </v>
<v Speaker 1>Institution.</v>

30
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:35.150
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

31
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.410
<v Speaker 1>Everyone does agree that it style is </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of areas and winning elections with</v>

32
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>over 96 percent of the vote doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly sound democratic,</v>

33
00:01:42.681 --> 00:01:43.760
<v Speaker 1>does it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:44.594
<v Speaker 1>despite all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can judge a man that he's taking </v>

35
00:01:46.131 --> 00:01:46.964
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda out of poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The figures speak for themselves since </v>

36
00:01:49.581 --> 00:01:50.414
<v Speaker 1>Paul Kagame came into power Rwandans to </v>
<v Speaker 1>triple their income and the percentage </v>

37
00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.320
<v Speaker 1>of the population that lives in extreme </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty is reducing gear.</v>

38
00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:01.750
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>

39
00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:02.613
<v Speaker 1>how did Rwanda end up like this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or perhaps maybe this is too good to be </v>

40
00:02:06.041 --> 00:02:06.874
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I just the some detail we're missing </v>

41
00:02:08.591 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>here today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:09.701 --> 00:02:12.430
<v Speaker 1>we are going to answer those questions </v>
<v Speaker 1>before we do.</v>

43
00:02:12.431 --> 00:02:14.650
<v Speaker 1>As usual.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look back at the history.</v>

44
00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:15.790
<v Speaker 1>I'm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trust me,</v>

45
00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.370
<v Speaker 1>this one is pretty intense.</v>

46
00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.040
<v Speaker 1>Fabricated hatred.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this date,</v>

47
00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.540
<v Speaker 1>April the sixth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>19,</v>

48
00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:26.433
<v Speaker 1>94 on this date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the plane the Rwandan president was </v>

49
00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.370
<v Speaker 1>flying in was hit spine anti aircraft </v>
<v Speaker 1>gun</v>

50
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.390
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

51
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:37.223
<v Speaker 1>the notes who organized this attack,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the ones an army soldiers belong to </v>

52
00:02:40.591 --> 00:02:43.950
<v Speaker 1>the Hutu trolley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>blames that rival the Tutsis.</v>

53
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.873
<v Speaker 1>Tutsis were a minority inside ruins.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're living in an apartheid </v>

54
00:02:47.371 --> 00:02:48.204
<v Speaker 1>situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Local media referred to them as </v>

55
00:02:49.411 --> 00:02:50.244
<v Speaker 1>cockroaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and many of them had already escaped to </v>

56
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:55.980
<v Speaker 1>refugee camps in neighboring countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but no one could have predicted that the</v>

57
00:02:55.981 --> 00:02:59.220
<v Speaker 1>mounting prejudice would have unleashed </v>
<v Speaker 1>such carnage</v>

58
00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:27.453
<v Speaker 3>bottle.</v>

59
00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.640
<v Speaker 1>What messages like this with broadcast </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the radio,</v>

60
00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.330
<v Speaker 1>there are one's an army was passing out </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubs and machetes to civilians.</v>

61
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.440
<v Speaker 1>If any of those who to civilians showed </v>
<v Speaker 1>mercy to his or her tootsie neighbors,</v>

62
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.680
<v Speaker 1>he or she would risk being executed as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>collaborator.</v>

63
00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.910
<v Speaker 1>Explains why many Rwandans clubs there,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tootsie wives to death,</v>

64
00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.610
<v Speaker 1>and 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even some Catholic churches became human</v>

65
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:00.453
<v Speaker 1>slaughterhouses in just 100 days.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nearly a million people died by their </v>

66
00:04:03.651 --> 00:04:04.500
<v Speaker 1>neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Machete.</v>

67
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.263
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now you might be wondering why did the </v>

68
00:04:10.171 --> 00:04:11.004
<v Speaker 1>Hutus hate the Tutsi so much with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>really that different and while the </v>

69
00:04:14.251 --> 00:04:15.990
<v Speaker 1>answer is you expect is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nope,</v>

70
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.243
<v Speaker 1>you see many African countries have lots</v>
<v Speaker 1>of different cultures and races living </v>

71
00:04:29.981 --> 00:04:31.210
<v Speaker 1>together.</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Africa,</v>

72
00:04:31.211 --> 00:04:33.400
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has nine official languages.</v>

73
00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:38.550
<v Speaker 1>Your guns or it's over $50.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

74
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.870
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda and territory with surprisingly </v>
<v Speaker 1>homogenous for centuries,</v>

75
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.520
<v Speaker 1>one single language on a single culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Hutus and Tutsis and other tribes,</v>

76
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.760
<v Speaker 1>they lived in relative harmony in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>20th century,</v>

77
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:52.623
<v Speaker 1>Belgium colonized this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the first policies made by the </v>

78
00:04:55.211 --> 00:04:56.044
<v Speaker 1>Belgian government was to force the </v>
<v Speaker 1>locals to label themselves according to </v>

79
00:04:58.751 --> 00:05:01.540
<v Speaker 1>the tribe they belonged to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This way,</v>

80
00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:04.690
<v Speaker 1>it would be easier for the colonizers to</v>
<v Speaker 1>identify who was who,</v>

81
00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:08.613
<v Speaker 1>and during the first years the Tutsis </v>
<v Speaker 1>were the tribe in charge of government </v>

82
00:05:11.261 --> 00:05:14.050
<v Speaker 1>institutions created by the Belgians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one's eight,</v>

83
00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.240
<v Speaker 1>those Tutsis started asking for </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent,</v>

84
00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:17.103
<v Speaker 1>and that's when Belgian started </v>
<v Speaker 1>supporting the Hutus with racist </v>

85
00:05:19.361 --> 00:05:20.194
<v Speaker 1>propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how when Rwanda became a </v>

86
00:05:21.791 --> 00:05:22.624
<v Speaker 1>sovereign state in 1962,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hutus and Tutsis had already become </v>

87
00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:27.400
<v Speaker 1>fierce enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That hatred,</v>

88
00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:32.110
<v Speaker 1>it was fabricated by the colonizers and </v>
<v Speaker 1>many Tutsis had to flee to refugee camps</v>

89
00:05:32.111 --> 00:05:32.944
<v Speaker 1>in neighboring countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Among them was the man that you see on </v>

90
00:05:40.211 --> 00:05:41.660
<v Speaker 1>the screen now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pull Kagomi,</v>

91
00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.573
<v Speaker 1>now remember his name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it will be the key figure in </v>

92
00:05:44.381 --> 00:05:45.780
<v Speaker 1>this story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll look at Goldman.</v>

93
00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:48.850
<v Speaker 1>He was raised on one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>aforementioned refugee camps.</v>

94
00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.040
<v Speaker 1>This one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was situated in Uganda.</v>

95
00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:53.850
<v Speaker 1>It was the beginning of the 19 eighties </v>
<v Speaker 1>back then Uganda.</v>

96
00:05:53.851 --> 00:05:54.684
<v Speaker 1>Ganzer was in the middle of a civil war </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kagomi along with other Rwandan </v>

97
00:05:57.441 --> 00:06:00.500
<v Speaker 1>refugees for to the Ugandan government </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they want,</v>

98
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:09.200
<v Speaker 1>and this is how to army as a military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Legend was born in the 19 nineties.</v>

99
00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:12.650
<v Speaker 1>He would lead other attacks against the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hutu lead Rwandan government's,</v>

100
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:17.710
<v Speaker 1>but the turning points was in 1990 for </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 days after that horrific massacre.</v>

101
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>On April the sixth,</v>

102
00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:25.730
<v Speaker 1>Tacoma was making his entrance in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kigali,</v>

103
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:28.920
<v Speaker 1>the Rwandan carbon with 2,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

104
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.430
<v Speaker 1>The genocide was over and Rwanda,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it had a new government.</v>

105
00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:33.323
<v Speaker 1>This time it was a Tutsi lead.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Governments with Kagomi serving as the </v>

106
00:06:35.851 --> 00:06:36.684
<v Speaker 1>vice presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a second because the </v>

107
00:06:38.821 --> 00:06:41.400
<v Speaker 1>story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't just end here because imagine</v>

108
00:06:41.401 --> 00:06:42.234
<v Speaker 1>the scenario for one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he had to help lead a divided country </v>

109
00:06:44.251 --> 00:06:45.084
<v Speaker 1>where genocide survivors how to live </v>
<v Speaker 1>next to the neighbors that had killed </v>

110
00:06:47.881 --> 00:06:48.430
<v Speaker 1>their friends</v>

111
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:49.263
<v Speaker 2>family.</v>

112
00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.293
<v Speaker 1>I didn't tell that Rwanda was one of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>10 poorest countries on earth with few </v>

113
00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.250
<v Speaker 1>resources to export,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and on top of all of that,</v>

114
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:00.263
<v Speaker 1>this brand new tootsie government was </v>
<v Speaker 1>not an example of transparency and </v>

115
00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:06.060
<v Speaker 1>respect for human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

116
00:07:06.061 --> 00:07:08.190
<v Speaker 1>many of the soldiers who had taken over </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kigali,</v>

117
00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.100
<v Speaker 1>they wanted revenge and well during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next year,</v>

118
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.880
<v Speaker 1>no one made an effort to stop the </v>
<v Speaker 1>executions and the unfair trials.</v>

119
00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:15.743
<v Speaker 1>If this wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many ministers trying to use their </v>

120
00:07:17.371 --> 00:07:18.204
<v Speaker 1>positions to fill their pockets with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>little money that Rwanda hat corruption </v>

121
00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:24.720
<v Speaker 1>certainly on the rise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile for Kagomi had the charisma,</v>

122
00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:27.960
<v Speaker 1>the popular support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and especially the political ambition to</v>

123
00:07:27.961 --> 00:07:31.020
<v Speaker 1>rise even higher.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is why in March of 2000,</v>

124
00:07:31.021 --> 00:07:31.854
<v Speaker 1>let Hootsuite,</v>
<v Speaker 1>president resilience man's without an </v>

125
00:07:33.300 --> 00:07:34.230
<v Speaker 1>election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.123
<v Speaker 1>the inevitable happens gamay the eternal</v>
<v Speaker 1>president in the year 2000 army became </v>

127
00:07:43.711 --> 00:07:48.060
<v Speaker 1>the new Rwandan presidents until you </v>
<v Speaker 1>came to Palo with two clear goals.</v>

128
00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.960
<v Speaker 1>The first one was to unify the Rwandan </v>
<v Speaker 1>people after the genocide.</v>

129
00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:54.510
<v Speaker 1>The second was to pull this country out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of poverty.</v>

130
00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.810
<v Speaker 1>So what did he do to achieve this goal?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

131
00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:58.703
<v Speaker 1>he traveled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're going to be created an advisory </v>

132
00:08:04.971 --> 00:08:07.430
<v Speaker 1>team that went to countries like China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thailand,</v>

133
00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>and Singapore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So can you guess what?</v>

134
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:11.690
<v Speaker 1>Those three places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do they have in common?</v>

135
00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:12.583
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is that they were countries </v>

136
00:08:13.701 --> 00:08:16.900
<v Speaker 1>that used to be poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then they were emerging nations.</v>

137
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.580
<v Speaker 1>Kagomi arranged meetings with </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians.</v>

138
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:25.280
<v Speaker 1>Economists send civil sevens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from these meetings he wrote down at</v>

139
00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:26.123
<v Speaker 1>scores of ideas in a notebook.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then he returns with the golden formula </v>

140
00:08:29.140 --> 00:08:29.973
<v Speaker 1>to build a wealthy country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This notebook became the foundation for </v>

141
00:08:32.501 --> 00:08:35.620
<v Speaker 1>the brand new Rwandan constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more importantly,</v>

142
00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.613
<v Speaker 1>vision 20 slash 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically vision 20 slash 20 was it </v>

143
00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.750
<v Speaker 1>government development plan launched by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paul Kagame,</v>

144
00:08:40.751 --> 00:08:41.584
<v Speaker 1>gummy with the goal of transforming </v>
<v Speaker 1>wander into a middle income country in </v>

145
00:08:44.441 --> 00:08:45.274
<v Speaker 1>just two days.</v>

146
00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:47.900
<v Speaker 2>Modern,</v>

147
00:08:47.900 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>peaceful country for extreme poverty no </v>
<v Speaker 1>longer existed,</v>

148
00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:51.793
<v Speaker 1>but wait just a minute because this </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't the normal buzzword filled speech </v>

149
00:08:54.321 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>of a politician Rwanda's vision 20 slash</v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

150
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:59.880
<v Speaker 1>It had 44.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Clear and accountable goals,</v>

151
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.920
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>except that by the year 20,</v>

152
00:09:01.921 --> 00:09:02.754
<v Speaker 1>21 in every three rooms in this must </v>
<v Speaker 1>have electricity at home for both the </v>

153
00:09:06.050 --> 00:09:08.100
<v Speaker 1>governments and private consultancy </v>
<v Speaker 1>firms.</v>

154
00:09:08.101 --> 00:09:10.910
<v Speaker 1>That analyzing and measuring the </v>
<v Speaker 1>progress of all of these.</v>

155
00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:17.993
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of those targets was to make her </v>

156
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>one's at a gender equality haven ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

157
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:23.544
<v Speaker 1>the Rwandan constitution requires that </v>
<v Speaker 1>at least 50 percent of all government </v>

158
00:09:26.911 --> 00:09:31.911
<v Speaker 1>positions held by women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

159
00:09:33.861 --> 00:09:36.050
<v Speaker 1>at the time of making this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are ones in parliament,</v>

160
00:09:36.051 --> 00:09:36.884
<v Speaker 1>has the biggest share of female mps in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the entire world and to the wage gap </v>

161
00:09:40.551 --> 00:09:45.020
<v Speaker 1>between men and women is lower than in </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries as progressive as Denmark.</v>

162
00:09:45.290 --> 00:09:46.123
<v Speaker 1>Today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a brand new generation of </v>

163
00:09:47.631 --> 00:09:48.464
<v Speaker 1>female Rwandan entrepreneurs leading the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country and what's more Rwanda is </v>

164
00:09:55.001 --> 00:09:58.810
<v Speaker 1>investing the small amounts of money </v>
<v Speaker 1>they collected in taxes pretty wisely in</v>

165
00:09:58.811 --> 00:09:59.644
<v Speaker 1>a country where 80 percent of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>population used to live off subsistence </v>

166
00:10:02.231 --> 00:10:04.840
<v Speaker 1>farming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government is built power generators</v>

167
00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:07.870
<v Speaker 1>and roads that increase agricultural </v>
<v Speaker 1>productivity.</v>

168
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:11.260
<v Speaker 1>Now we're ones in farmers are beginning </v>
<v Speaker 1>to export food to their neighbors.</v>

169
00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.970
<v Speaker 1>All of this explains why 23 years after </v>
<v Speaker 1>the genocide,</v>

170
00:10:19.090 --> 00:10:23.500
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda GDP is growing at an average rate</v>
<v Speaker 1>of eight percent a year.</v>

171
00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:24.513
<v Speaker 1>This is similar to emerging economies </v>
<v Speaker 1>like China or Vietnam on the same </v>

172
00:10:27.881 --> 00:10:31.360
<v Speaker 1>streets where in 1994 people were </v>
<v Speaker 1>clubbing each other to death.</v>

173
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:34.210
<v Speaker 1>Startups like Rwanda motorcycle company </v>
<v Speaker 1>are being born.</v>

174
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:38.350
<v Speaker 1>The motorcycle factory was created this </v>
<v Speaker 1>year in 2017 with American investment.</v>

175
00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:40.540
<v Speaker 1>If you want to start a company in </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighboring countries,</v>

176
00:10:40.570 --> 00:10:43.930
<v Speaker 1>you will need weeks or even months to </v>
<v Speaker 1>deal with all the paperwork in Rwanda.</v>

177
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:45.940
<v Speaker 1>You're done with all that in just two </v>
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

178
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:46.863
<v Speaker 1>As of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this has attracted a lot of foreign </v>

179
00:10:48.911 --> 00:10:51.970
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially from China and America,</v>

180
00:10:52.020 --> 00:10:54.700
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering how </v>
<v Speaker 1>did they end up here?</v>

181
00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.990
<v Speaker 1>Once Polka gummies secrets welded,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you have the answer.</v>

182
00:10:58.010 --> 00:11:03.010
<v Speaker 1>It has a light side,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it also has a dark side at gunpoint.</v>

183
00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Everyone believes it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rwanda works.</v>

184
00:11:07.140 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>Streets are safe and tolerance between </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hutus and Tutsis is imposed vinyl.</v>

185
00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:11.533
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

186
00:11:14.990 --> 00:11:15.823
<v Speaker 1>no one's in constitution itself forbids </v>
<v Speaker 1>the use of the words Tutsi and Hutus to </v>

187
00:11:19.641 --> 00:11:20.474
<v Speaker 1>refer to a person according to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government or citizens are Rwandans and </v>

188
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:26.270
<v Speaker 1>no one should care about their tribe of </v>
<v Speaker 1>origin.</v>

189
00:11:26.330 --> 00:11:29.900
<v Speaker 1>Either the media nor institutions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>allowed to say anything that could spark</v>

190
00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:34.130
<v Speaker 1>hatred or open past scars and well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

191
00:11:34.131 --> 00:11:36.350
<v Speaker 1>they call it even criticize the </v>
<v Speaker 1>governance.</v>

192
00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:39.770
<v Speaker 1>Both the police and the military.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are present all over the country to</v>

193
00:11:39.771 --> 00:11:42.500
<v Speaker 1>make sure that everyone follows these </v>
<v Speaker 1>laws.</v>

194
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:43.401
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true.</v>

195
00:11:43.401 --> 00:11:44.234
<v Speaker 1>Balking on me is a popular presidents in</v>
<v Speaker 1>dd has his own youtube channel and to </v>

196
00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:49.790
<v Speaker 1>twitter and facebook account that he </v>
<v Speaker 1>uses almost daily,</v>

197
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.620
<v Speaker 1>but no one else has the freedom to </v>
<v Speaker 1>express their ideas freely.</v>

198
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same goes for other political </v>

199
00:11:59.081 --> 00:12:01.120
<v Speaker 1>parties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the president.</v>

200
00:12:01.121 --> 00:12:05.530
<v Speaker 1>He's been in power for 17 years and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>wins elections with outcomes higher than</v>

201
00:12:05.590 --> 00:12:08.280
<v Speaker 1>95 percent of the votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

202
00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:10.570
<v Speaker 1>you is not exactly democratic.</v>

203
00:12:10.730 --> 00:12:12.350
<v Speaker 4>One of his opponents,</v>
<v Speaker 4>friend Kevin,</v>

204
00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:13.493
<v Speaker 4>the only permitted opposition party </v>
<v Speaker 4>hailed the process he had attempted to </v>

205
00:12:17.571 --> 00:12:20.800
<v Speaker 4>run for the 2010 presidential election </v>
<v Speaker 4>party,</v>

206
00:12:20.810 --> 00:12:22.910
<v Speaker 4>was unable to register for the vote.</v>

207
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:24.003
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rwandan model is based on three </v>

208
00:12:25.541 --> 00:12:26.830
<v Speaker 1>pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ease of investing,</v>

209
00:12:26.831 --> 00:12:27.664
<v Speaker 1>and doing business infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>developments and at the top an </v>

210
00:12:30.041 --> 00:12:33.780
<v Speaker 1>authoritarian governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they'd guarantee safety and tolerance at</v>

211
00:12:33.790 --> 00:12:35.340
<v Speaker 1>the expense of other human rights.</v>

212
00:12:39.170 --> 00:12:40.720
<v Speaker 1>Now we want to know what your opinion </v>
<v Speaker 1>is.</v>

213
00:12:40.721 --> 00:12:43.420
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that this lack of democracy</v>
<v Speaker 1>is legitimate?</v>

214
00:12:43.421 --> 00:12:47.260
<v Speaker 1>If the country can step out of poverty </v>
<v Speaker 1>or perhaps Rhonda would be better off if</v>

215
00:12:47.261 --> 00:12:50.290
<v Speaker 1>they structured the country in a more </v>
<v Speaker 1>democratic in Western model?</v>
