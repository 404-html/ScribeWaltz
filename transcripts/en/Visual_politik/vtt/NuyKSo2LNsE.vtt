1
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.933
<v Speaker 1>It seems to be in the Korean Peninsula,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the drums of war are constantly </v>

2
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:19.524
<v Speaker 1>rumbling,</v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly true that this area is not </v>

3
00:00:27.471 --> 00:00:28.304
<v Speaker 1>known for its peacefulness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the kind of tension that the area </v>

4
00:00:30.441 --> 00:00:33.530
<v Speaker 1>has been recently feeling has not </v>
<v Speaker 1>existed for some time.</v>

5
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:34.393
<v Speaker 1>The United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country which already had 30,000 </v>

6
00:00:36.231 --> 00:00:37.064
<v Speaker 1>soldiers deployed in the area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has also deployed several aircraft </v>

7
00:00:39.681 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>carriers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>heavy bombers,</v>

8
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.880
<v Speaker 1>and even advanced anti missile system in</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea.</v>

9
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.743
<v Speaker 1>It is so advanced that China has even </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered it a threat to their own </v>

10
00:00:48.081 --> 00:00:48.914
<v Speaker 1>security,</v>

11
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.600
<v Speaker 2>trying to tells us to remove antimissile</v>
<v Speaker 2>key h,</v>

12
00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:56.030
<v Speaker 2>a d system from South Korea amid spying </v>
<v Speaker 2>fears.</v>

13
00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:57.143
<v Speaker 1>North Korea on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>keeps carrying out a new tests with </v>

14
00:00:59.521 --> 00:01:02.880
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missiles and is progressing </v>
<v Speaker 1>with its nuclear program.</v>

15
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.743
<v Speaker 1>It seems that North Korea doesn't really</v>
<v Speaker 1>care about all the international </v>

16
00:01:06.361 --> 00:01:09.930
<v Speaker 1>legislation about nonproliferation and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear testing.</v>

17
00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>Japan and South Korea are feeling </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably temps.</v>

18
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.453
<v Speaker 1>They want to know what to do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what decisions to make step by step in </v>

19
00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.130
<v Speaker 1>order to stop the growing threat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is Kim Jong.</v>

20
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.230
<v Speaker 1>UHM,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

21
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.720
<v Speaker 1>His most recent missile launch is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely intolerable.</v>

22
00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.693
<v Speaker 1>You'll need to take a stand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We already told you in a previous video </v>

23
00:01:29.941 --> 00:01:30.774
<v Speaker 1>here at visual politic about how Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>is seriously considering putting an end </v>

24
00:01:34.201 --> 00:01:35.034
<v Speaker 1>to the pacifists nature of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution and it seems that right </v>

25
00:01:37.651 --> 00:01:40.020
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Beijing has had enough of Pyongyang</v>

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.053
<v Speaker 2>quarterly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sent a 150,000 troops to North Korea's </v>

27
00:01:43.951 --> 00:01:44.784
<v Speaker 2>border.</v>

28
00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:45.713
<v Speaker 1>If this story were a movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd probably leave the center and </v>

29
00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.180
<v Speaker 1>thinking that the writer had taken too </v>
<v Speaker 1>much creative liberty</v>

30
00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:52.133
<v Speaker 3>dynamic.</v>

31
00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.640
<v Speaker 1>What is really happening in this region?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What can we actually expect?</v>

32
00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's what we're going to talk about in</v>

33
00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.700
<v Speaker 1>this visual politic video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we get into all of that,</v>

34
00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:10.563
<v Speaker 1>let's get some perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where are we and how did we get to the </v>

35
00:02:18.651 --> 00:02:23.380
<v Speaker 1>situation in North Korea is some sort of</v>
<v Speaker 1>nightmare from the past.</v>

36
00:02:23.381 --> 00:02:24.214
<v Speaker 1>It's a country still living in the cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>water country with one of the most </v>

37
00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.120
<v Speaker 1>totalitarian governments in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and along with all of that,</v>

38
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.840
<v Speaker 1>it's also one of the poorest countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

39
00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.370
<v Speaker 1>According to the United Nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Two out of five North Korean suffer from</v>

40
00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.590
<v Speaker 1>undernourishment buckskin.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Joe [inaudible],</v>

41
00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.410
<v Speaker 1>the guy who controls the country with an</v>
<v Speaker 1>iron fist,</v>

42
00:02:44.411 --> 00:02:48.200
<v Speaker 1>doesn't seem to give a damn about any of</v>
<v Speaker 1>that site.</v>

43
00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.233
<v Speaker 1>It is estimated the Pyongyang started to</v>
<v Speaker 1>develop its nuclear program around the </v>

44
00:02:52.451 --> 00:02:53.284
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties and since then there have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been a few key situations which have </v>

45
00:02:56.831 --> 00:02:59.020
<v Speaker 1>sped up this progress.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first was the fall,</v>

46
00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.943
<v Speaker 1>the Soviet Union in 1991.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then game George W dot Bush's </v>

47
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:07.820
<v Speaker 1>incorporation of North Korea into these </v>
<v Speaker 1>so called axis of evil in 2002.</v>

48
00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.280
<v Speaker 1>Then the was the coming to power of Kim </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jong EU in 2011.</v>

49
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.280
<v Speaker 1>We could say that every time the regime </v>
<v Speaker 1>felt threatened,</v>

50
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.240
<v Speaker 1>they decided to accelerate the process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bob,</v>

51
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.340
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to discuss that later in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the video.</v>

52
00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.633
<v Speaker 2>The issue is today,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is estimated that North Korea holds </v>

53
00:03:24.921 --> 00:03:29.270
<v Speaker 2>from 10 to 20 nuclear weapons and </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the Rand Corporation,</v>

54
00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.163
<v Speaker 2>if it doesn't stop producing them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the North Korean program could </v>

55
00:03:32.031 --> 00:03:34.790
<v Speaker 2>accumulate around 100 nuclear bombs by </v>
<v Speaker 2>the year 20,</v>

56
00:03:34.791 --> 00:03:35.624
<v Speaker 2>20.</v>

57
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.800
<v Speaker 1>But do you wait for just a second </v>
<v Speaker 1>because this isn't the end of the story,</v>

58
00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:42.740
<v Speaker 1>but now the technology used in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country as well?</v>

59
00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.603
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty basic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's based on old designs from the </v>

60
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.503
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the bombs they have developed up </v>

61
00:03:48.171 --> 00:03:50.060
<v Speaker 1>until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't work.</v>

62
00:03:50.061 --> 00:03:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Brilliant.</v>

63
00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:51.623
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

64
00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.150
<v Speaker 1>That is why Pyongyang is now obsessed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with two things.</v>

65
00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.013
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>attempting to miniaturize the bombs so </v>

66
00:04:01.151 --> 00:04:01.984
<v Speaker 1>they can be placed in missiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is developing </v>

67
00:04:06.101 --> 00:04:06.934
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missiles capable of attacking </v>
<v Speaker 1>targets that all thousands of miles </v>

68
00:04:10.301 --> 00:04:11.134
<v Speaker 1>away.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last tests they've conducted </v>

69
00:04:12.701 --> 00:04:16.120
<v Speaker 1>indicate that they are probably making </v>
<v Speaker 1>some important advances.</v>

70
00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:18.813
<v Speaker 1>Many analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the intelligence services of </v>

71
00:04:20.591 --> 00:04:21.424
<v Speaker 1>South Korea and the United States have </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered the North Korea is already </v>

72
00:04:24.551 --> 00:04:25.384
<v Speaker 1>capable of weaponizing short and mid </v>
<v Speaker 1>range missiles with nuclear warheads </v>

73
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:31.420
<v Speaker 1>which could allow them to reach South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea and Japan.</v>

74
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.113
<v Speaker 1>That's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems clear that if the program </v>

75
00:04:35.621 --> 00:04:39.610
<v Speaker 1>doesn't stop in a few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea will be capable of attacking</v>

76
00:04:39.611 --> 00:04:42.520
<v Speaker 1>the United States of America with </v>
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missiles.</v>

77
00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.550
<v Speaker 1>This would be a significant strategic </v>
<v Speaker 1>leap for North Korea and that difference</v>

78
00:04:47.591 --> 00:04:51.070
<v Speaker 1>is a red line.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which is causing the Pentagon many,</v>

79
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:56.160
<v Speaker 1>many headaches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

80
00:04:59.721 --> 00:05:01.910
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't the US done anything to stop this</v>

81
00:05:01.911 --> 00:05:05.780
<v Speaker 1>country as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that they have tried almost</v>

82
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:06.703
<v Speaker 1>every</v>

83
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:11.183
<v Speaker 2>us strategy.</v>

84
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.540
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

85
00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.373
<v Speaker 1>the United States and South Korea have </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to persuade Pyongyang to abandon </v>

86
00:05:17.591 --> 00:05:20.470
<v Speaker 1>that plan of developing nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

87
00:05:20.471 --> 00:05:24.280
<v Speaker 1>they didn't have any problem taking out </v>
<v Speaker 1>a checkbook in order to do this</v>

88
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.930
<v Speaker 2>in the early nineties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>1994 to be specific,</v>

89
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:32.070
<v Speaker 2>Bill Clinton signed the agreement </v>
<v Speaker 2>framework by which North Korea committed</v>

90
00:05:32.071 --> 00:05:32.904
<v Speaker 2>to cancel it's military plans in </v>
<v Speaker 2>exchange for generous fueled help from </v>

91
00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:36.924
<v Speaker 2>the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as well as assistance to build two </v>

92
00:05:38.911 --> 00:05:42.350
<v Speaker 2>nuclear reactors for civilian use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With this disagreements,</v>

93
00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.420
<v Speaker 1>North Korea obtains the energy they </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to develop that economy.</v>

94
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:47.343
<v Speaker 1>As for South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides giving a huge amount of </v>

95
00:05:49.301 --> 00:05:52.690
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian aid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they also committed to boost and finance</v>

96
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.360
<v Speaker 1>North Korea's economic development </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs.</v>

97
00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 1>It all seem to be going well for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>while.</v>

98
00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.350
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it all fills pieces in 2002.</v>

99
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:01.184
<v Speaker 1>When George W dot Bush founds out that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang had been fooling them in </v>

100
00:06:04.401 --> 00:06:05.234
<v Speaker 1>secret North Korea at kept developing </v>
<v Speaker 1>its nuclear programs for military </v>

101
00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>purposes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After more negotiations,</v>

102
00:06:10.761 --> 00:06:11.594
<v Speaker 1>they reached a new agreements and Bush's</v>
<v Speaker 1>administration restarted their age </v>

103
00:06:14.871 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>program and lifted sanctions spots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A year later,</v>

104
00:06:17.991 --> 00:06:21.380
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang reneged on the deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite all of this,</v>

105
00:06:21.381 --> 00:06:26.381
<v Speaker 1>Barack Obama decided to try yet again in</v>
<v Speaker 1>February 2012,</v>

106
00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:30.200
<v Speaker 1>they reach a new agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea canceled the nuclear program</v>

107
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.200
<v Speaker 1>and the United States restarted once </v>
<v Speaker 1>again the economic game.</v>

108
00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 1>This time Pyongyang broke the agreement </v>
<v Speaker 1>only six weeks later.</v>

109
00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:38.603
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so now you're beginning to get the </v>

110
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:41.720
<v Speaker 1>picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

111
00:06:41.721 --> 00:06:43.310
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why a North Korea?</v>

112
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:46.070
<v Speaker 1>So insistence on having nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all,</v>

113
00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:53.773
<v Speaker 1>what are each looking for?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The regime of Kim Jong UN is pretty set </v>

114
00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:59.093
<v Speaker 1>on developing more advanced nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons and the international community </v>

115
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:03.024
<v Speaker 1>is going to have to get used to the idea</v>
<v Speaker 1>that this is not something they are </v>

116
00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:06.984
<v Speaker 1>going to abandon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that still leaves us with the </v>

117
00:07:08.971 --> 00:07:10.500
<v Speaker 1>question of why.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

118
00:07:10.501 --> 00:07:11.334
<v Speaker 1>first of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because they think that nuclear weapons </v>

119
00:07:12.541 --> 00:07:13.374
<v Speaker 1>are essential for the survival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Young young knows that with nuclear </v>

120
00:07:16.021 --> 00:07:19.350
<v Speaker 1>weapons around no foreign power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially the United States,</v>

121
00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.390
<v Speaker 1>would dat intervene in the country</v>

122
00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:26.770
<v Speaker 1>when the United States invaded Iraq,</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korean leaders,</v>

123
00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.663
<v Speaker 1>they were paying attention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but then the first mistake Saddam </v>

124
00:07:30.010 --> 00:07:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Hussein made was not having nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons and other wmds.</v>

125
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:36.310
<v Speaker 1>They thought the same thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Gaddafi's regime fell,</v>

126
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:37.173
<v Speaker 1>there'd be a voluntarily canceled it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>program for the development of wmds a </v>

127
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:42.143
<v Speaker 1>few years earlier,</v>

128
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.250
<v Speaker 1>so the North Korean leadership thinks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so honestly that probably right,</v>

129
00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.090
<v Speaker 1>that nuclear weapons are the best </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee to staying in power.</v>

130
00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:51.953
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the sales of nuclear weapons technology </v>

131
00:07:53.551 --> 00:07:54.384
<v Speaker 1>is one of the main sources of foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency coming into the country </v>

132
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.380
<v Speaker 1>currency that's needed so the elite can </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintain their standards of living since</v>

133
00:08:01.381 --> 00:08:02.214
<v Speaker 1>the fall of the Soviet Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has become one of the main </v>

134
00:08:04.951 --> 00:08:08.700
<v Speaker 1>exporters of missile equipment </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and components.</v>

135
00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.600
<v Speaker 1>USC says North Korean ship taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles to Yemen.</v>

136
00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:14.033
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indications are that North Korea has </v>

137
00:08:15.211 --> 00:08:16.044
<v Speaker 1>sold nuclear technology to Iran and </v>
<v Speaker 1>advised Syria in the construction of a </v>

138
00:08:19.591 --> 00:08:20.424
<v Speaker 1>nuclear reactor that Israel bombarded in</v>
<v Speaker 1>2007 is really strike targeted Syrian </v>

139
00:08:25.741 --> 00:08:27.540
<v Speaker 1>nuclear reactor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Telegraph,</v>

140
00:08:27.630 --> 00:08:30.000
<v Speaker 1>it is precisely this risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>proliferation,</v>

141
00:08:30.001 --> 00:08:33.990
<v Speaker 1>which is why the United States is trying</v>
<v Speaker 1>so hard to stop North Korea.</v>

142
00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:35.430
<v Speaker 1>The other reason is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

143
00:08:35.431 --> 00:08:36.264
<v Speaker 1>do you try to prevent this country from </v>
<v Speaker 1>being capable of threatening the United </v>

144
00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.193
<v Speaker 1>States with a nuclear attack so well now</v>
<v Speaker 1>we come to China and what China thinks </v>

145
00:08:44.191 --> 00:08:45.030
<v Speaker 1>of all of this</v>

146
00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:50.100
<v Speaker 3>China.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One</v>

147
00:08:50.100 --> 00:08:50.933
<v Speaker 1>thing is if it weren't for trying to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support North Korea would have never </v>

148
00:08:54.061 --> 00:08:54.894
<v Speaker 1>developed its nuclear and it isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>the technological part that we're </v>

149
00:08:57.871 --> 00:09:01.440
<v Speaker 1>talking about here or the support to </v>
<v Speaker 1>avoid international penalties.</v>

150
00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:02.303
<v Speaker 1>It's also the money trying to accounts </v>
<v Speaker 1>for more than 90 percent of North </v>

151
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.000
<v Speaker 1>Korea's total trade daily and k.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

152
00:09:09.001 --> 00:09:11.110
<v Speaker 1>without the support of Beijing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

153
00:09:11.111 --> 00:09:13.830
<v Speaker 1>it would have collapsed a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

154
00:09:13.831 --> 00:09:15.750
<v Speaker 1>there are some signs which tell us </v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

155
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:16.613
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're a bit tied up so much </v>

156
00:09:17.281 --> 00:09:20.850
<v Speaker 1>provocation because they're not happy </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this nuclear missiles either.</v>

157
00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:21.713
<v Speaker 1>It could be said for Beijing killing </v>
<v Speaker 1>Yang is now a burden that China has to </v>

158
00:09:24.991 --> 00:09:25.824
<v Speaker 1>deal with as it attempts to gain </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence and leadership in </v>

159
00:09:27.841 --> 00:09:32.100
<v Speaker 1>international politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trying to take the driver's seat on free</v>

160
00:09:32.101 --> 00:09:32.934
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some analysts have even suggested the </v>

161
00:09:34.871 --> 00:09:37.950
<v Speaker 1>Beijing might be losing control over the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government of Pyongyang,</v>

162
00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:41.580
<v Speaker 1>which is now self absorbed by then new </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear capability.</v>

163
00:09:41.670 --> 00:09:44.700
<v Speaker 1>Importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for the first time in November of 2006,</v>

164
00:09:44.701 --> 00:09:45.534
<v Speaker 1>China agreed to completely stick with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the international sanctions being </v>

165
00:09:48.361 --> 00:09:51.090
<v Speaker 1>leveled against North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Besides in the last few months.</v>

166
00:09:51.091 --> 00:09:55.410
<v Speaker 1>China is forbid a North Korean coal </v>
<v Speaker 1>imports and gas exports and weld.</v>

167
00:09:55.411 --> 00:09:57.840
<v Speaker 1>The international community is holding </v>
<v Speaker 1>its breath.</v>

168
00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.630
<v Speaker 1>That is a significant punishments that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong,</v>

169
00:10:00.690 --> 00:10:01.523
<v Speaker 1>Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>regime ams wealth is more international </v>

170
00:10:03.541 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>relations between these two countries is</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at its best points.</v>

171
00:10:07.090 --> 00:10:09.210
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Kim Jong Un women came to power,</v>

172
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.300
<v Speaker 1>no top level bilateral meetings have </v>
<v Speaker 1>taken place.</v>

173
00:10:12.301 --> 00:10:15.750
<v Speaker 1>And now less and less official visits </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the countries.</v>

174
00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:16.613
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Beijing really changing its </v>

175
00:10:18.811 --> 00:10:20.610
<v Speaker 1>relationship with Pyong Yang?</v>

176
00:10:20.650 --> 00:10:21.500
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

177
00:10:24.610 --> 00:10:25.750
<v Speaker 1>a road to solution.</v>

178
00:10:28.490 --> 00:10:31.790
<v Speaker 1>It is still to seemed tonight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't be fooled for the time being.</v>

179
00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:34.670
<v Speaker 1>China is not going to let North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall,</v>

180
00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:37.190
<v Speaker 1>which is still an ally for them in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>

181
00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.250
<v Speaker 1>at least not until they have serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>reasons to do so.</v>

182
00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:41.593
<v Speaker 1>That is a key point to understand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we want to find a solution to this </v>

183
00:10:44.391 --> 00:10:45.224
<v Speaker 1>crisis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China needs to be persuaded to try and </v>

184
00:10:47.001 --> 00:10:47.834
<v Speaker 1>make Pyongyang put an end to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cancel their nuclear program and carry </v>

185
00:10:51.111 --> 00:10:51.944
<v Speaker 1>out real reforms,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that winds happen under the current </v>

186
00:10:54.280 --> 00:10:55.113
<v Speaker 1>setup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is why many experts think it is </v>

187
00:10:56.451 --> 00:10:57.284
<v Speaker 1>time for the United States to withdraw </v>
<v Speaker 1>from Korea and consider dismantling the </v>

188
00:11:00.801 --> 00:11:05.120
<v Speaker 1>anti missile system and perhaps consider</v>
<v Speaker 1>some economic compensation as well.</v>

189
00:11:05.180 --> 00:11:06.013
<v Speaker 1>It is also important that China </v>
<v Speaker 1>understands that the current situation </v>

190
00:11:08.751 --> 00:11:09.584
<v Speaker 1>might need South Korea and Japan to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pursue an arms race as well as the </v>

191
00:11:12.381 --> 00:11:15.320
<v Speaker 1>option of developing that own nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

192
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:16.183
<v Speaker 1>So now we've told you our opinion here </v>
<v Speaker 1>at visual politic and we'd love to know </v>

<v Speaker 1>administration should do?</v>

196
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you think North Korea should put an </v>
<v Speaker 1>end to its nuclear plans?</v>

197
00:11:28.430 --> 00:11:30.770
<v Speaker 1>Should they even possibly be threatened </v>
<v Speaker 1>with war?</v>
