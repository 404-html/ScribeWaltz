00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Hell is the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What would you say is a drug?</v>

2
00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:14.070
<v Speaker 1>Traffic has biggest dream,</v>

3
00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:15.720
<v Speaker 2>blow blow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Romo,</v>

<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

00:00:16.281 --> 00:00:16.640
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>

00:00:18.331 --> 00:00:21.980
<v Speaker 2>pop,</v>
<v Speaker 2>pop sites or pornography go.</v>

10
00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:22.983
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain myself because we </v>

11
00:00:24.281 --> 00:00:25.114
<v Speaker 1>all have dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You mean politicians and of course drug </v>

12
00:00:27.731 --> 00:00:29.860
<v Speaker 1>traffickers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are no exception.</v>

13
00:00:29.861 --> 00:00:32.820
<v Speaker 1>They are people too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There may be hard to believe in law,</v>

14
00:00:32.821 --> 00:00:33.654
<v Speaker 1>sort of the ruthless and cruel drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>trafficking in industry because there </v>

15
00:00:36.641 --> 00:00:40.930
<v Speaker 1>are human beings with names.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in this case also nicknamed zoo.</v>

16
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:41.793
<v Speaker 1>Just like everyone else have dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get back to my original </v>

17
00:00:44.711 --> 00:00:45.544
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is the biggest dream that a drug </v>

18
00:00:47.801 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>trafficker could have?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

19
00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.043
<v Speaker 1>of course they might be different </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible answers and it cause we're all </v>

20
00:00:51.821 --> 00:00:52.654
<v Speaker 1>individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But unfortunately history tells us that </v>

21
00:00:54.431 --> 00:00:56.680
<v Speaker 1>if most drug traffickers good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>make a wish,</v>

22
00:00:56.681 --> 00:00:57.514
<v Speaker 1>just one single wish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be to turn the country into a </v>

23
00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:03.490
<v Speaker 1>narco state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say they would turn them into</v>

24
00:01:03.491 --> 00:01:06.220
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>run by a kind of criminal corporation,</v>

25
00:01:06.221 --> 00:01:08.200
<v Speaker 1>meetup of politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>public officials,</v>

26
00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:09.880
<v Speaker 1>judges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the police and the military,</v>

27
00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:10.743
<v Speaker 1>which in one way or another we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>associated with drugs way drug traffic </v>

28
00:01:14.461 --> 00:01:16.480
<v Speaker 1>is good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically Act with impunity.</v>

29
00:01:16.481 --> 00:01:19.960
<v Speaker 1>Exporting and distributing narcotics is </v>
<v Speaker 1>without any restrictions.</v>

30
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.010
<v Speaker 1>Very recently here on visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we spoke about how the bolivarian regime</v>

31
00:01:24.011 --> 00:01:24.844
<v Speaker 1>of Nicolas Maduro dl start Okabe Oh and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the cartel de los [inaudible] was </v>

32
00:01:27.941 --> 00:01:30.430
<v Speaker 1>turning Venezuela into a narco state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

33
00:01:30.431 --> 00:01:31.264
<v Speaker 1>in Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a politics that goes far beyond </v>

34
00:01:33.521 --> 00:01:34.810
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>

35
00:01:34.811 --> 00:01:35.644
<v Speaker 1>we're going to find out it's a bit more </v>
<v Speaker 1>about one character who was able to </v>

36
00:01:37.931 --> 00:01:41.980
<v Speaker 1>promote the alliance between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>narcotics industry and politicians,</v>

37
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.843
<v Speaker 1>so listen up</v>

38
00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:44.120
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible].</v>

39
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.100
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

40
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.360
<v Speaker 2>Narco populism.</v>

41
00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.813
<v Speaker 3>We,</v>

42
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.853
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's the narcotics industry is one of </v>

43
00:01:59.081 --> 00:01:59.914
<v Speaker 1>the most important illegal businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>every year and moved several hundred </v>

44
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.190
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now allow me to ask another question.</v>

45
00:02:06.191 --> 00:02:09.760
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that are cartel can survive</v>
<v Speaker 1>without political support?</v>

46
00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.330
<v Speaker 1>Can they survive without controlling the</v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions in some way?</v>

47
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.223
<v Speaker 1>To answer this question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's go back to the beginning and take </v>

48
00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.560
<v Speaker 1>a look at how the most important drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>dealers of all time managed to do it.</v>

49
00:02:20.561 --> 00:02:22.840
<v Speaker 1>It's because even though it's true that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the beginning,</v>

50
00:02:22.841 --> 00:02:26.170
<v Speaker 1>drug traffickers started out as little </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a band of outlaws.</v>

51
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:31.060
<v Speaker 1>The time came when this all changed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A time came and so did it.</v>

52
00:02:31.061 --> 00:02:31.894
<v Speaker 1>Protagonists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Blue Escobar Gaviria considered by </v>

53
00:02:37.431 --> 00:02:42.110
<v Speaker 1>Forbes magazine to be one of the richest</v>
<v Speaker 1>men of his time on the entire planet.</v>

54
00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.033
<v Speaker 1>According to Forbes in 1987 Pablo </v>
<v Speaker 1>Escobar had a fortune that exceeded $2 </v>

55
00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:48.463
<v Speaker 1>billion and Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he radically changed the global drug </v>

56
00:02:50.391 --> 00:02:50.730
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

57
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.563
<v Speaker 3>Great.</v>

58
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.253
<v Speaker 1>See on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you created an entire network of </v>

59
00:02:56.191 --> 00:03:00.640
<v Speaker 1>criminal holding company that included </v>
<v Speaker 1>businesses like kidnapping,</v>

60
00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:01.593
<v Speaker 1>murder,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course their main activity of </v>

61
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:04.204
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these activities were perfectly </v>

62
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:09.160
<v Speaker 1>integrated into a structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The metagene cartel,</v>

63
00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.570
<v Speaker 1>which has a clear organizational chart,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a well defined hierarchy,</v>

64
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600
<v Speaker 1>and even a zone based distribution </v>
<v Speaker 1>network,</v>

65
00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.463
<v Speaker 1>each with its own managers talking in </v>
<v Speaker 1>business speak these words sort of like </v>

66
00:03:20.621 --> 00:03:21.454
<v Speaker 1>franchises or branches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand is regarding his main </v>

67
00:03:24.311 --> 00:03:26.070
<v Speaker 1>business drugs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This cartel,</v>

68
00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.913
<v Speaker 1>the Mexican cartel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved an almost complete vertical </v>

69
00:03:29.591 --> 00:03:30.424
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the cartel took over the </v>

70
00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.220
<v Speaker 1>harvest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the production,</v>

71
00:03:33.221 --> 00:03:34.054
<v Speaker 1>the distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the marketing of the vast majority </v>

72
00:03:35.951 --> 00:03:36.784
<v Speaker 1>of its merchandise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They did everything and they took over </v>

73
00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:40.023
<v Speaker 1>every single stage of the business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's how the Medellin cartel and </v>

74
00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.910
<v Speaker 1>managed to bring in more than $7 billion</v>
<v Speaker 1>per year.</v>

75
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:51.803
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this would've been possible </v>

76
00:03:52.681 --> 00:03:54.990
<v Speaker 1>without the complicity of the public </v>
<v Speaker 1>authority.</v>

77
00:03:54.991 --> 00:03:55.824
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

78
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:57.053
<v Speaker 4>Lee Escobar reached the top of the </v>
<v Speaker 4>cocaine cartel by astutely reinvesting </v>

79
00:04:00.811 --> 00:04:04.620
<v Speaker 4>his initial earnings and becoming a PR </v>
<v Speaker 4>master in Colombia.</v>

80
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.550
<v Speaker 4>With his growing wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Escobar bought a newspaper in Midian,</v>

81
00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:09.443
<v Speaker 4>gained influence in Colombian politics </v>
<v Speaker 4>and he successfully ran for public </v>

82
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:16.080
<v Speaker 4>office becoming an alternative to the </v>
<v Speaker 4>national congress.</v>

83
00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.410
<v Speaker 4>David Henry Forbes magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 4>1987</v>

84
00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.110
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for many years,</v>

85
00:04:27.111 --> 00:04:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar had impunity with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and threads.</v>

86
00:04:30.621 --> 00:04:32.890
<v Speaker 1>The well known phrase of Silver </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

87
00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.780
<v Speaker 1>He managed to infiltrate the Colombian </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

88
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.610
<v Speaker 1>He bribes the military,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

89
00:04:37.611 --> 00:04:38.444
<v Speaker 1>governors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the police in such a way that many </v>

90
00:04:40.221 --> 00:04:41.054
<v Speaker 1>Colombian institutions were under his </v>
<v Speaker 1>command for a long time and that's not </v>

91
00:04:44.541 --> 00:04:45.374
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar also financed electoral </v>

92
00:04:46.881 --> 00:04:47.714
<v Speaker 1>campaigns to win popular support.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what does a politician do when he </v>

93
00:04:50.601 --> 00:04:52.580
<v Speaker 1>wants to gain popularity fast?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

94
00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.443
<v Speaker 1>he promoted projects like the building </v>
<v Speaker 1>of houses for the nation's poorest </v>

95
00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.780
<v Speaker 1>citizens as well as distributing </v>
<v Speaker 1>provisions and creating soccer field.</v>

96
00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.350
<v Speaker 1>It's pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it?</v>

97
00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.470
<v Speaker 1>I mean at first glance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of like a Colombian Robin Hood,</v>

98
00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.113
<v Speaker 1>too bad.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth was rather defer while he was </v>

99
00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:13.274
<v Speaker 1>carrying out this type of campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He had no qualms about flooding the </v>

100
00:05:15.681 --> 00:05:19.520
<v Speaker 1>streets with violence and blood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to knock a popular,</v>

101
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.573
<v Speaker 1>as you will probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar managed to hold a seat in </v>

102
00:05:24.681 --> 00:05:27.410
<v Speaker 1>the Colombian parliaments in 1982 until </v>
<v Speaker 1>then,</v>

103
00:05:27.411 --> 00:05:30.470
<v Speaker 1>thanks to his political influence and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his pr strategies,</v>

104
00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:34.040
<v Speaker 1>he was able to build his embar and is </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge fortune with the</v>

105
00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.033
<v Speaker 4>osmosis impunity.</v>
<v Speaker 4>A member of the United States Drug </v>

106
00:05:38.191 --> 00:05:39.024
<v Speaker 4>Enforcement Agency once said that </v>
<v Speaker 4>importing exotic animals for his zoo </v>

107
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.900
<v Speaker 4>caused escobar more problems with the </v>
<v Speaker 4>government.</v>

108
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.910
<v Speaker 4>That is drug business.</v>
<v Speaker 4>David Henry</v>

109
00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.731
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh,</v>

110
00:05:48.731 --> 00:05:49.564
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think the Pablo Escobar's </v>

111
00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:52.344
<v Speaker 1>political relations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what limited to Colombia at all after </v>

112
00:05:55.291 --> 00:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>being elected as a deputy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the,</v>

113
00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:58.423
<v Speaker 1>it became untenable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but some members of the media began </v>

114
00:06:00.351 --> 00:06:04.060
<v Speaker 1>telling the truth behind his fortune.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The DEA is pressure multiplied.</v>

115
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:05.203
<v Speaker 1>A lot of Colombian society understood </v>
<v Speaker 1>the huge danger that's Pablo Escobar </v>

116
00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:09.563
<v Speaker 1>posed and other cartels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they began to fear the power that the </v>

117
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.093
<v Speaker 1>median cartel would grow into.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's when the government began to </v>

118
00:06:15.411 --> 00:06:16.244
<v Speaker 1>persecute this capo,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which in a way declared war on the </v>

119
00:06:18.531 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Colombian state itself and just to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe.</v>

120
00:06:21.291 --> 00:06:24.290
<v Speaker 1>The first thing Escobar did was leave </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country less.</v>

121
00:06:24.291 --> 00:06:25.310
<v Speaker 1>Td hunted down</v>

122
00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.820
<v Speaker 3>the lead,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sorry,</v>

123
00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:39.420
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar put some space between </v>
<v Speaker 1>himself and Columbia.</v>

124
00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.330
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>where could he find refuge?</v>

125
00:06:42.331 --> 00:06:46.050
<v Speaker 1>Would his drug money be enough to </v>
<v Speaker 1>strengthen his alliances?</v>

126
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.330
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems absolutely so.</v>

127
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.400
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was panel at that time,</v>

128
00:06:52.401 --> 00:06:53.234
<v Speaker 1>the military dictator manual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Antonio Noreaga offered asylum </v>

129
00:06:55.911 --> 00:06:58.910
<v Speaker 1>protection and to root to transport his </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchandise.</v>

130
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.940
<v Speaker 1>So imagine this industry was so powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>that even dictators were willing to sell</v>

131
00:07:04.521 --> 00:07:05.354
<v Speaker 1>their services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that as you can see in her </v>

132
00:07:08.031 --> 00:07:10.730
<v Speaker 1>ego,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also turns Panama into a narco state.</v>

133
00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:11.593
<v Speaker 1>That is until 1989 when a lightening </v>
<v Speaker 1>invasion by the United States removed </v>

134
00:07:14.871 --> 00:07:16.460
<v Speaker 1>him from power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was detained,</v>

135
00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:17.353
<v Speaker 1>taken to the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and given 30 years in prison for his </v>

136
00:07:19.581 --> 00:07:22.400
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking and his relationship </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a median cartel.</v>

137
00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:26.283
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the end of Palu Escobar's </v>

138
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:28.563
<v Speaker 1>external alliances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that he didn't feel very </v>

139
00:07:31.151 --> 00:07:32.890
<v Speaker 1>safe and Panama either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

140
00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.230
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dictator of the country was his pal,</v>

141
00:07:35.231 --> 00:07:38.230
<v Speaker 1>but the CIA had a very large presence in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

142
00:07:38.231 --> 00:07:42.370
<v Speaker 1>So when he needs to expected it to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nuria could be attempted to sell him out</v>

143
00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.290
<v Speaker 1>because of course it was one thing to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>business with a Panamanian dictator.</v>

144
00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:48.910
<v Speaker 1>It's quite another to and trust him with</v>
<v Speaker 1>his protection.</v>

145
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.660
<v Speaker 1>He needed to find a new destination.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So through the left wing,</v>

146
00:07:52.661 --> 00:07:53.494
<v Speaker 1>Colombian guerrilla movements am 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar contacted the Nicaraguan </v>

147
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:57.660
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

148
00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:58.493
<v Speaker 3>Don't remember</v>

149
00:08:00.950 --> 00:08:04.100
<v Speaker 1>the Sandinista government board led by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country's current president.</v>

150
00:08:04.101 --> 00:08:04.934
<v Speaker 1>Daniel Ortega was willing to welcome </v>
<v Speaker 1>them with open arms in exchange for a </v>

151
00:08:08.271 --> 00:08:09.170
<v Speaker 1>commission,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>

152
00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:12.560
<v Speaker 1>for services rendered.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The agreement specified that in addition</v>

153
00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:14.450
<v Speaker 1>to settling in the country with his </v>
<v Speaker 1>family,</v>

154
00:08:14.451 --> 00:08:15.284
<v Speaker 1>if Pablo could use some of Nicaragua,</v>
<v Speaker 1>was regions as a drug distribution </v>

155
00:08:18.621 --> 00:08:21.050
<v Speaker 1>platform,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the problem or take her in his friends,</v>

156
00:08:21.051 --> 00:08:23.170
<v Speaker 1>they were very greedy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a few months later,</v>

157
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:27.470
<v Speaker 1>Pavlo decided to return to Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course he maintained his business</v>

158
00:08:27.471 --> 00:08:32.410
<v Speaker 1>relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This mole along with Nicaragua,</v>

159
00:08:32.411 --> 00:08:33.244
<v Speaker 1>the m 19 gorillas also facilitated the </v>
<v Speaker 1>median cartels contacts with the Cuban </v>

160
00:08:36.491 --> 00:08:37.324
<v Speaker 1>governor.</v>

161
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.830
<v Speaker 3>Yup,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that's</v>

162
00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:40.663
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba was also a trading platform for </v>

163
00:08:42.111 --> 00:08:44.150
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar's businesses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

164
00:08:44.180 --> 00:08:45.013
<v Speaker 1>it is known that Pablo Escobar </v>
<v Speaker 1>maintained good relations with the </v>

165
00:08:47.121 --> 00:08:49.070
<v Speaker 1>Castro brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although truthfully,</v>

166
00:08:49.071 --> 00:08:49.904
<v Speaker 1>it seems that he wasn't the only one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All evidence indicates that after </v>

167
00:08:52.491 --> 00:08:53.324
<v Speaker 1>Escobar rather drug dealers continue to </v>
<v Speaker 1>use during the Castro is to introduce </v>

168
00:08:56.791 --> 00:08:59.670
<v Speaker 1>all types of narcotics into the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States anyway,</v>

169
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:00.640
<v Speaker 1>Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panama,</v>

170
00:09:00.641 --> 00:09:01.890
<v Speaker 1>and Nicaragua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba.</v>

171
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.843
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a political power was one of the main </v>

172
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.770
<v Speaker 1>drivers of the huge presence of drug </v>
<v Speaker 1>trafficking and Latin America.</v>

173
00:09:07.830 --> 00:09:09.780
<v Speaker 1>The lack of transparency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the corruption,</v>

174
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:10.643
<v Speaker 1>lack of counterweights and weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions where a perfect breeding </v>

175
00:09:13.111 --> 00:09:13.944
<v Speaker 1>grounds for what over the years became </v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the great and nightmares of this </v>

176
00:09:16.531 --> 00:09:17.790
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And yes,</v>

177
00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:19.320
<v Speaker 1>some of you might now be thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

178
00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.180
<v Speaker 1>all right Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the end,</v>

179
00:09:21.181 --> 00:09:22.920
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Escobar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he fell from power.</v>

180
00:09:23.490 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true,</v>

181
00:09:24.331 --> 00:09:25.164
<v Speaker 1>but when a man like Escobar falls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean that the industry falls </v>

182
00:09:28.231 --> 00:09:30.540
<v Speaker 1>and can order their relations with </v>
<v Speaker 1>political power.</v>

183
00:09:30.630 --> 00:09:31.730
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at Mexico.</v>

184
00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:38.150
<v Speaker 3>The relay,</v>

185
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.953
<v Speaker 1>the main Mexican cartel with which Pablo</v>
<v Speaker 1>Escobar had a relationship was the </v>

186
00:09:44.541 --> 00:09:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Guadalajara cartel led by Anesto Fon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>second,</v>

187
00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:48.313
<v Speaker 1>Rafael Caro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Quintero and Niguel and hell Felix </v>

188
00:09:51.470 --> 00:09:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Guyardo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This cartel had full impunity for two </v>

189
00:09:54.530 --> 00:09:55.363
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All thanks to their relations with </v>

190
00:09:56.601 --> 00:09:58.070
<v Speaker 1>people in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Felix,</v>

191
00:09:58.071 --> 00:09:58.904
<v Speaker 1>Guy Otto was in charge of public </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations and thanks to his ability to </v>

192
00:10:01.701 --> 00:10:03.530
<v Speaker 1>move within the highest political </v>
<v Speaker 1>spheres.</v>

193
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:07.310
<v Speaker 1>This cartel had all the stability it </v>
<v Speaker 1>needed to develop and grow.</v>

194
00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.410
<v Speaker 1>Pr Is really important.</v>

195
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.290
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a criminal industry </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in criminal organizations,</v>

196
00:10:18.291 --> 00:10:21.440
<v Speaker 1>stability is very hard to achieve.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

197
00:10:21.441 --> 00:10:24.410
<v Speaker 1>the assaults on the dea agents on reggae</v>
<v Speaker 1>arena,</v>

198
00:10:24.440 --> 00:10:25.273
<v Speaker 1>which ends it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his life made Washington demands the </v>

199
00:10:26.661 --> 00:10:30.050
<v Speaker 1>dismantling of this cartel and it's neat</v>
<v Speaker 1>as fell one by one,</v>

200
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:30.943
<v Speaker 1>but this didn't end the business from </v>
<v Speaker 1>prison in 1989 Phoenix Guyardo tried to </v>

201
00:10:35.031 --> 00:10:35.864
<v Speaker 1>reorganize the territories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in the absence of an agreement with </v>

202
00:10:38.171 --> 00:10:39.004
<v Speaker 1>the cartel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's listened to the tijuana cartel led </v>

203
00:10:40.941 --> 00:10:41.774
<v Speaker 1>by the Ra on her brothers and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sinaloa cartel led by Hector Louis </v>

204
00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:46.513
<v Speaker 1>Palmar Salazar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] Palmer and Hakim Guzman </v>

205
00:10:48.620 --> 00:10:48.961
<v Speaker 1>Maria.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

206
00:10:48.961 --> 00:10:49.794
<v Speaker 1>I'll chapo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They both debuted on the Forbes list in </v>

207
00:10:51.621 --> 00:10:55.030
<v Speaker 1>2009 with an estimated 14 of more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>$1 billion.</v>

208
00:10:56.970 --> 00:10:57.803
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

209
00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.920
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that under El Chapo has come</v>
<v Speaker 1>on,</v>

210
00:10:59.970 --> 00:11:03.900
<v Speaker 1>the scene or lower cartel became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most important and influential cartel in</v>

211
00:11:03.901 --> 00:11:07.950
<v Speaker 1>Mexico and one of the most important </v>
<v Speaker 1>criminal organizations in the world.</v>

212
00:11:08.050 --> 00:11:11.250
<v Speaker 1>The question that many of you might be </v>
<v Speaker 1>asking now is how did he do it?</v>

213
00:11:11.251 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 1>How can one cartel grow so much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than its adversaries?</v>

214
00:11:15.090 --> 00:11:17.610
<v Speaker 1>What above all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because of political influences.</v>

215
00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:18.473
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how do you prevent the federal police </v>

216
00:11:19.771 --> 00:11:23.010
<v Speaker 1>from cashing you and nine your business?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

217
00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:25.770
<v Speaker 1>you would do that by finding out a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when those raids are going to happen,</v>

218
00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:26.633
<v Speaker 1>everything is based on good relations </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's precisely what El Chapo made </v>

219
00:11:30.301 --> 00:11:33.360
<v Speaker 1>sure that he would have inflammation and</v>
<v Speaker 1>friends,</v>

220
00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:35.940
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>power as we've seen in other cases.</v>

221
00:11:35.941 --> 00:11:39.420
<v Speaker 1>I'll chappy's capture it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't really change the panorama today.</v>

222
00:11:39.421 --> 00:11:43.020
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a lower cartel is controlled </v>
<v Speaker 1>by Ismael l mayors and Bardo,</v>

223
00:11:43.021 --> 00:11:43.854
<v Speaker 1>who over the years has been known to buy</v>
<v Speaker 1>officials from the special prosecutor's </v>

224
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:48.510
<v Speaker 1>office,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Attorney General's office,</v>

225
00:11:48.511 --> 00:11:52.110
<v Speaker 1>and even the Counter Narcotics </v>
<v Speaker 1>Intelligence Center and elite army corps</v>

226
00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:57.100
<v Speaker 1>creators to fight narcotics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously they don't do these businesses</v>

227
00:11:57.101 --> 00:11:58.450
<v Speaker 1>alone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In many cases,</v>

228
00:11:58.451 --> 00:11:59.284
<v Speaker 1>they have the approval or participation </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the authorities Fj our researcher at </v>

229
00:12:03.551 --> 00:12:04.384
<v Speaker 1>the University of Guadalajara,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is all done in complicity with </v>

230
00:12:07.631 --> 00:12:09.070
<v Speaker 1>senior government official</v>

231
00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.300
<v Speaker 1>only that explains these criminal </v>
<v Speaker 1>groups,</v>

232
00:12:13.301 --> 00:12:15.400
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>strength and resilience.</v>

233
00:12:15.430 --> 00:12:16.263
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's go power with which in many </v>

234
00:12:17.681 --> 00:12:21.070
<v Speaker 1>cases norcos create a symbiosis that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>hard to distinguish.</v>

235
00:12:21.100 --> 00:12:21.933
<v Speaker 1>That's what's happening in Venezuela </v>
<v Speaker 1>with a soulless cartel of which we've </v>

236
00:12:24.371 --> 00:12:25.204
<v Speaker 1>already spoken here on visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>and watch out because it's estimated </v>

237
00:12:27.551 --> 00:12:31.990
<v Speaker 1>that the Mexican and Venezuelan cartels </v>
<v Speaker 1>control 70% of all drugs and tend to the</v>

238
00:12:31.991 --> 00:12:32.824
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

239
00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:37.450
<v Speaker 1>That's what happens in countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Guatemala where some sources,</v>

240
00:12:37.451 --> 00:12:38.284
<v Speaker 1>states and the time to 80% of all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>white powder could be mediated by </v>

241
00:12:40.871 --> 00:12:43.330
<v Speaker 1>members of the national army itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

242
00:12:43.331 --> 00:12:44.164
<v Speaker 1>what's happening in Honduras where even </v>
<v Speaker 1>the son of former presidents Porfirio </v>

243
00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:48.543
<v Speaker 1>Lobo has been condemned in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States for drug trafficking activities </v>

244
00:12:51.281 --> 00:12:53.620
<v Speaker 1>while his own father was president of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the republic.</v>

245
00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:54.341
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

246
00:12:54.341 --> 00:12:57.010
<v Speaker 1>that is the result of having weak </v>
<v Speaker 1>institutions,</v>

247
00:12:57.011 --> 00:13:00.250
<v Speaker 1>a lack of transparency and the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>counterweights in future videos.</v>

248
00:13:00.251 --> 00:13:01.810
<v Speaker 1>We're going to talk more about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue,</v>

249
00:13:01.811 --> 00:13:04.750

251
00:13:06.431 --> 00:13:10.720
<v Speaker 1>examples of how some of the greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>norcos succeeded largely thanks to their</v>

252
