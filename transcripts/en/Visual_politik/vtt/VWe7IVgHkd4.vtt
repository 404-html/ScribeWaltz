1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.150
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is undergoing some of its </v>
<v Speaker 1>worst moments.</v>

2
00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:04.013
<v Speaker 1>This disaster is so huge that what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>once one of the largest and most </v>

3
00:00:07.081 --> 00:00:07.914
<v Speaker 1>powerful oil companies in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>PDVSA is now practically bankrupt and </v>

4
00:00:12.061 --> 00:00:15.360
<v Speaker 1>has more problems including extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the oil.</v>

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:16.223
<v Speaker 1>So how does the oil company with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest reserves in the world have </v>

6
00:00:19.651 --> 00:00:21.210
<v Speaker 1>problems extracting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

7
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.350
<v Speaker 1>Well that's what we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in today's video,</v>

8
00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:33.423
<v Speaker 1>folks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think we all probably know it's </v>

9
00:00:35.441 --> 00:00:36.274
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is undergoing a true </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and not only an economic </v>

10
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:41.194
<v Speaker 1>one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is above all a humanitarian </v>

11
00:00:42.971 --> 00:00:47.971
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's such a huge disaster that in recent</v>

12
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.710
<v Speaker 1>years it has caused between three and 4 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million Venezuelans to flee the country.</v>

13
00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:57.320
<v Speaker 1>That's more than one in every 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

14
00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.540
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is we're not really </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprised by this.</v>

15
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.970
<v Speaker 1>Si,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the latest statistics,</v>

16
00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:02.863
<v Speaker 1>80 at 7% of the population that's nearly</v>
<v Speaker 1>nine out of every 10 Venezuelans are </v>

17
00:01:06.801 --> 00:01:08.210
<v Speaker 1>poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>

18
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.960
<v Speaker 1>most of Venezuela's population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>60% isn't only poor.</v>

19
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.080
<v Speaker 1>They live in extreme poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>

20
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.853
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela is burning down according to </v>
<v Speaker 1>data from the Venezuelan social </v>

21
00:01:25.191 --> 00:01:28.520
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Observe a treat in 2017 almost 10,000</v>

22
00:01:28.521 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 1>protests were registered throughout the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

23
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.370
<v Speaker 1>More than 27 per day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And what's even worse than this?</v>

24
00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.300
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

25
00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.770
<v Speaker 1>according to information from Attorney </v>
<v Speaker 1>General Luis Ortega,</v>

26
00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.510
<v Speaker 1>since 2015 the police,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the national guard,</v>

27
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.520
<v Speaker 1>the army as the different intelligence </v>
<v Speaker 1>services have killed more than 8,000</v>

28
00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.570
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

29
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.580
<v Speaker 1>most of them were opposes to the right</v>

30
00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.530
<v Speaker 2>Jesus Christ.</v>

31
00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.060
<v Speaker 1>Hunger,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

32
00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:04.150
<v Speaker 1>repression,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything indicates that Venezuela will</v>

33
00:02:04.151 --> 00:02:04.984
<v Speaker 1>soon undergo a refugee crisis of </v>
<v Speaker 1>colossal dimensions because let's be </v>

34
00:02:09.011 --> 00:02:11.200
<v Speaker 1>clear their view,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and let's be honest,</v>

35
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 1>things they're not looking good.</v>

36
00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.640
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>

37
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.980
<v Speaker 1>for years the Bolivarian Revolution of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chavez,</v>

38
00:02:16.981 --> 00:02:17.814
<v Speaker 1>Maduro and company has a great ally and </v>
<v Speaker 1>there we're not too worried about Cuba </v>

39
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:23.220
<v Speaker 1>or Russia or any other country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a matter of fact,</v>

40
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.083
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The black gold that financed the </v>

41
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:30.150
<v Speaker 1>revolution for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the huge income,</v>

42
00:02:30.151 --> 00:02:33.240
<v Speaker 1>this raw material brought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>financed all of the regimes,</v>

43
00:02:33.241 --> 00:02:34.350
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends.</v>

44
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.000
<v Speaker 1>They didn't really care about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>

45
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:38.591
<v Speaker 1>So,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

46
00:02:38.591 --> 00:02:39.424
<v Speaker 1>factories were closing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign investment was fleeing the </v>

47
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:42.454
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it didn't matter because while they </v>

48
00:02:43.661 --> 00:02:46.600
<v Speaker 1>have loads and loads of money from all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that oil,</v>

49
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:48.930
<v Speaker 1>but all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well it's about to end.</v>

50
00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela does have a lot of oil,</v>

51
00:02:51.551 --> 00:02:56.551
<v Speaker 1>but one thing is having oil and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing is being able to exploit set oil.</v>

52
00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.450
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that Pdvsa the national our</v>
<v Speaker 1>is practically about to collapse.</v>

53
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:02.410
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

54
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:07.411
<v Speaker 1>up the fall of pedevesa petroleum of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

55
00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:16.014
<v Speaker 1>PDVSA was created by government decree </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1976 do you integrate all the oil </v>

56
00:03:20.191 --> 00:03:21.024
<v Speaker 1>assets that the state had nationalized </v>
<v Speaker 1>this company soon became a world class </v>

57
00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.410
<v Speaker 1>colossus as you know.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>

58
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>

59
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:34.224
<v Speaker 1>because this company has the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves on the planet as when we say </v>

60
00:03:37.741 --> 00:03:40.320
<v Speaker 1>large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we mean large.</v>

61
00:03:40.321 --> 00:03:41.154
<v Speaker 1>There are more than 300 billion barrels </v>
<v Speaker 1>of oil certified here more than the </v>

62
00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:46.650
<v Speaker 1>reserves of Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Emirates,</v>

63
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.900
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or any other oil power.</v>

64
00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.381
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

65
00:03:49.381 --> 00:03:51.300
<v Speaker 1>it is true and we have set it on this </v>
<v Speaker 1>channel before.</v>

66
00:03:51.301 --> 00:03:53.850
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan oil doesn't have the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality,</v>

67
00:03:53.851 --> 00:03:54.684
<v Speaker 1>but that doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a huge amount of </v>

68
00:03:57.241 --> 00:03:59.880
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 20% of the world's noon</v>

69
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:00.973
<v Speaker 2>herbs,</v>

70
00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.383
<v Speaker 1>and the fact is that this company paid </v>
<v Speaker 1>evasive peaks in production in 1998 a </v>

71
00:04:06.871 --> 00:04:10.800
<v Speaker 1>year before Hugo Chavez came to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at which time the company was extracting</v>

72
00:04:10.801 --> 00:04:13.530
<v Speaker 1>three and a half million barrels per </v>
<v Speaker 1>day.</v>

73
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.930
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things have changed a lot.</v>

74
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:16.793
<v Speaker 1>By the year of Hugo Chavez death in 2013</v>
<v Speaker 1>production had decreased by 1 million </v>

75
00:04:21.391 --> 00:04:26.391
<v Speaker 1>barrels per day day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So could it be that Hugo Chavez bothered</v>

76
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.750
<v Speaker 1>area and government didn't like oil?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Could it all be part of a twisted,</v>

77
00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:33.220
<v Speaker 1>bland,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do diversify Venezuelan economy?</v>

78
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:35.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

79
00:04:35.351 --> 00:04:40.351
<v Speaker 1>it's quite the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If he had known me,</v>

80
00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.453
<v Speaker 1>do you want me [inaudible] petroleum </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hugo Chavez to increase production to 5 </v>

81
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.950
<v Speaker 1>million barrels?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem was that they simply weren't</v>

82
00:04:55.951 --> 00:04:58.010
<v Speaker 1>able to do it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But if you think that that command,</v>

83
00:04:58.011 --> 00:05:01.170
<v Speaker 1>his results were bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you haven't seen anything.</v>

84
00:05:01.171 --> 00:05:02.004
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because since Nicolas Maduro came to </v>

85
00:05:03.151 --> 00:05:05.820
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>production has sunk to 1.8</v>

86
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.520
<v Speaker 1>million barrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means like while countries like the</v>

87
00:05:08.521 --> 00:05:10.650
<v Speaker 1>United States of doubles their </v>
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>

88
00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:14.790
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela produces half as much oil has </v>
<v Speaker 1>when the revolution began.</v>

89
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:15.653
<v Speaker 1>So hardly a fantastic success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you think that that's the worst </v>

90
00:05:31.191 --> 00:05:32.030
<v Speaker 1>of it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get prepared.</v>

91
00:05:32.031 --> 00:05:35.660
<v Speaker 1>Do you think again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because the future is looking a lot more</v>

92
00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.070
<v Speaker 1>bleak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So at this point in the video,</v>

93
00:05:37.071 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

94
00:05:38.091 --> 00:05:40.070
<v Speaker 1>what on earth is going on with paid a </v>
<v Speaker 1>visa?</v>

95
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.230
<v Speaker 1>The keys of a disaster for toll.</v>

96
00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.520
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 3>databases.</v>

97
00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:52.373
<v Speaker 1>History.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Divya has been the story of a disaster </v>

98
00:05:55.321 --> 00:05:57.030
<v Speaker 1>for tolls.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The best example of that,</v>

99
00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.973
<v Speaker 1>the Power wanna refining complex,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which consists of three crude oil </v>

100
00:06:00.831 --> 00:06:01.664
<v Speaker 1>refineries and just one of the three </v>
<v Speaker 1>largest complexes of its kind in the </v>

101
00:06:04.851 --> 00:06:05.684
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For years it was Venezuela's industrial </v>

102
00:06:07.881 --> 00:06:09.740
<v Speaker 1>pride,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the crown duel,</v>

103
00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:10.610
<v Speaker 1>if you will.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

104
00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.473
<v Speaker 1>today it barely operates at 15% capacity</v>
<v Speaker 1>and all kinds of accidents tend to </v>

105
00:06:15.921 --> 00:06:16.754
<v Speaker 1>happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

106
00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:19.340
<v Speaker 1>why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's no maintenance.</v>

107
00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>They sucked everything they could from </v>
<v Speaker 1>pedevesa without investing,</v>

108
00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.580
<v Speaker 1>there's nothing left to squeeze.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Publishes Pedis Plant Operator,</v>

109
00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:26.533
<v Speaker 1>and this is certainly not an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extraordinary case at the end of </v>

110
00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.930
<v Speaker 1>October.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Also in the [inaudible] refining complex</v>

111
00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:33.903
<v Speaker 1>and why refineries spills over 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>gallons of gasoline into the bay a few </v>

112
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:39.980
<v Speaker 1>days later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another refinery in the complex,</v>

113
00:06:39.981 --> 00:06:40.814
<v Speaker 1>the card on refinery itself to fire that</v>
<v Speaker 1>fireman could barely contain because </v>

114
00:06:43.851 --> 00:06:46.330
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even have the foam to fight </v>
<v Speaker 1>the flame.</v>

115
00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:48.863
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

116
00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:50.323
<v Speaker 1>long and on and on it goes because the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth is that most of the old companies </v>

117
00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:54.693
<v Speaker 1>facilities are in terrible condition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So how do you think that they reached </v>

118
00:06:57.581 --> 00:07:02.581
<v Speaker 1>this point?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

119
00:07:08.731 --> 00:07:10.640
<v Speaker 1>the Chavez government always saw paid a </v>
<v Speaker 1>vase,</v>

120
00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:11.474
<v Speaker 1>a as I kind of dairy cow from which they</v>
<v Speaker 1>could get all the resources they needed </v>

121
00:07:15.151 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>for the revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The problem is that the oil industry,</v>

122
00:07:17.981 --> 00:07:20.520
<v Speaker 1>it requires lots and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

123
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:21.383
<v Speaker 1>and these are investments that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan government simply did not </v>

124
00:07:23.701 --> 00:07:28.610
<v Speaker 1>want to make.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even with that fact,</v>

125
00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.220
<v Speaker 1>it's still indebted the company to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brim.</v>

126
00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:33.980
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know how indebted this company is</v>

127
00:07:33.981 --> 00:07:34.790
<v Speaker 1>today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.623
<v Speaker 1>listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not talking about one or 5 </v>

129
00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.623
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about 90 billion American </v>

130
00:07:40.671 --> 00:07:41.504
<v Speaker 1>dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A fortune so big that Venezuela could </v>

131
00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:46.340
<v Speaker 1>have even bought multinationals like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Goldman Sachs,</v>

132
00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:47.420
<v Speaker 1>Nike or semen</v>

133
00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.183
<v Speaker 1>is just an insane amount of debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you think there's a that's going </v>

134
00:07:54.711 --> 00:07:55.550
<v Speaker 1>on?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:56.413
<v Speaker 1>not even close.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also use the company to plug in </v>

136
00:07:58.521 --> 00:08:01.340
<v Speaker 1>place and hire thousands and thousands </v>
<v Speaker 1>of supporters,</v>

137
00:08:01.341 --> 00:08:04.010
<v Speaker 1>friends and family members around which </v>
<v Speaker 1>paid a visa,</v>

138
00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.580
<v Speaker 1>lost even more resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if that wasn't enough,</v>

139
00:08:07.581 --> 00:08:08.414
<v Speaker 1>the Chavez regime also placed unskilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>and inexperienced personnel in </v>

140
00:08:11.451 --> 00:08:15.560
<v Speaker 1>management positions while dismissing </v>
<v Speaker 1>and driving away thousands and thousands</v>

141
00:08:15.561 --> 00:08:18.680
<v Speaker 1>of experienced employees because of that</v>
<v Speaker 1>political beliefs.</v>

142
00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:19.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how pdvsa ran out of money and </v>

143
00:08:21.531 --> 00:08:24.830
<v Speaker 1>ran out of human resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And now with all of this information,</v>

144
00:08:24.831 --> 00:08:28.190
<v Speaker 1>we can really understand why oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>production is dropping in Venezuela.</v>

145
00:08:28.191 --> 00:08:30.140
<v Speaker 1>And of course the consequences of all of</v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

146
00:08:30.170 --> 00:08:31.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're terrible for the country.</v>

147
00:08:38.970 --> 00:08:40.140
<v Speaker 3>The consequences</v>

148
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.520
<v Speaker 1>oil is essential for the Venezuelan </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy,</v>

149
00:08:45.521 --> 00:08:48.850
<v Speaker 1>especially because there's no other </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry left standing.</v>

150
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:53.770
<v Speaker 1>That dependence on oil is so great that </v>
<v Speaker 1>it generates 95% of all foreign currency</v>

151
00:08:53.771 --> 00:08:58.650
<v Speaker 1>profits in dollars and these currencies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>div Ua,</v>

152
00:08:58.710 --> 00:08:59.543
<v Speaker 1>I won't finish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Swayla needs to be able to import food </v>

153
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:01.950
<v Speaker 1>medicine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline.</v>

154
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:02.850
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>

155
00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.820
<v Speaker 1>When I swayla still today has to import </v>
<v Speaker 1>gasoline as well.</v>

156
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:06.663
<v Speaker 1>There's pretty much everything else,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course there's oil production </v>

157
00:09:08.431 --> 00:09:09.264
<v Speaker 1>keeps plummeting.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country is able to import less </v>

158
00:09:11.791 --> 00:09:12.624
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

159
00:09:17.230 --> 00:09:18.063
<v Speaker 1>and you know what?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since Venezuela is producing nothing </v>

160
00:09:19.661 --> 00:09:21.220
<v Speaker 1>fantastic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we import everything.</v>

161
00:09:21.250 --> 00:09:24.970
<v Speaker 1>The dwindling oil money is no longer </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to pay all the bills.</v>

162
00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:26.440
<v Speaker 1>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you will know,</v>

163
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.350
<v Speaker 1>when you spend more money than you make,</v>
<v Speaker 1>money goes away.</v>

164
00:09:29.410 --> 00:09:31.480
<v Speaker 1>And that's precisely what's happening to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela,</v>

165
00:09:31.510 --> 00:09:32.343
<v Speaker 1>which according to some calculations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>valley has $10 billion in foreign </v>

166
00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:38.620
<v Speaker 1>reserves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is that lowest number in 40 years.</v>

167
00:09:38.650 --> 00:09:39.483
<v Speaker 1>This means that when the money is gone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they won't be able to import anything </v>

168
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:45.190
<v Speaker 1>else than what they can buy with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money they make from the oil,</v>

169
00:09:45.220 --> 00:09:46.053
<v Speaker 1>which she is decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you're probably beginning to see the </v>

170
00:09:48.431 --> 00:09:49.264
<v Speaker 1>problem.</v>

171
00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:52.653
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

172
00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:55.230
<v Speaker 1>Previously talked about on visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>

173
00:09:55.231 --> 00:09:56.064
<v Speaker 1>I'm Nicolas Maduro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has government has tried to buy time by </v>

174
00:09:57.791 --> 00:10:01.870
<v Speaker 1>resorting to international markets to </v>
<v Speaker 1>issue desk has pretty scandalous rates,</v>

175
00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:02.763
<v Speaker 1>sometimes as high as 40% obviously issue</v>
<v Speaker 1>in debt with implicit rates of 40% can </v>

176
00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:11.320
<v Speaker 1>only mean future ruin ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>

177
00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:13.930
<v Speaker 1>that's actually no longer a possibility.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

178
00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:14.793
<v Speaker 1>both of the Venezuelan government and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pedevesa are incurring defaults that is </v>

179
00:10:18.481 --> 00:10:19.314
<v Speaker 1>a on not paying that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I said Pete downgrades seven sovereign </v>

180
00:10:23.651 --> 00:10:27.070
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan bonds to the default level </v>
<v Speaker 1>and other they attempted was that of the</v>

181
00:10:27.071 --> 00:10:31.900
<v Speaker 1>Chinese rescue and the Chinese answers </v>
<v Speaker 1>and place more than $23 billion in loans</v>

182
00:10:31.901 --> 00:10:32.734
<v Speaker 1>on the table.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything has a limit and they are no </v>

183
00:10:35.111 --> 00:10:39.580
<v Speaker 1>longer willing to continue giving more </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and getting nothing in return.</v>

184
00:10:39.690 --> 00:10:40.523
<v Speaker 1>Let me just check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese oil companies seen OPEC </v>

185
00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.210
<v Speaker 1>sue's pit of Essa for unpaid debts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The situation,</v>

186
00:10:46.211 --> 00:10:47.044
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is so desperate that the Cuban </v>

187
00:10:48.161 --> 00:10:48.994
<v Speaker 1>government has decided to seize the 49% </v>
<v Speaker 1>that paid a visa held in a Cuban </v>

188
00:10:52.661 --> 00:10:55.320
<v Speaker 1>refinery is compensation for that unpaid</v>
<v Speaker 1>debts.</v>

189
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:55.950
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

190
00:10:55.950 --> 00:10:56.783
<v Speaker 1>that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not even Cuba trusts the maduro regime </v>

191
00:10:58.670 --> 00:11:03.310
<v Speaker 1>and it was all of this that led to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest Chavista events for Petro.</v>

192
00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:09.743
<v Speaker 4>Yep.</v>

193
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:11.510
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crypto currency.</v>

194
00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:14.093
<v Speaker 1>As we've seen with everyday that passes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan government has less </v>

195
00:11:16.921 --> 00:11:17.754
<v Speaker 1>access to foreign currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is obviously a huge problem </v>

196
00:11:20.281 --> 00:11:23.070
<v Speaker 1>because without a foreign currency they </v>
<v Speaker 1>can't import,</v>

197
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:25.410
<v Speaker 1>but based on this problem and idea came </v>
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>

198
00:11:25.411 --> 00:11:26.244
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrency is in fashion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why not launch their own </v>

199
00:11:28.441 --> 00:11:29.274
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrency?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While they did and they called it the </v>

200
00:11:31.021 --> 00:11:31.700
<v Speaker 1>petro</v>

201
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.533
<v Speaker 4>not good enough.</v>
<v Speaker 4>They're not going to be good for the </v>

202
00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:46.960
<v Speaker 4>older.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Maybe your mountain tell too,</v>

203
00:11:46.961 --> 00:11:47.794
<v Speaker 4>because</v>

204
00:11:49.930 --> 00:11:53.680
<v Speaker 1>course the petro is a very particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency among other things because it's</v>

205
00:11:53.681 --> 00:11:56.290
<v Speaker 1>controlled by Maduro is governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>under these conditions.</v>

206
00:11:56.291 --> 00:11:57.124
<v Speaker 1>Let me ask you a question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you be willing to invest a single </v>

207
00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:02.440
<v Speaker 1>euro or a single dollar into this new </v>
<v Speaker 1>crypto currency?</v>

208
00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:04.900
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would you put your money in the hands of</v>

209
00:12:04.901 --> 00:12:06.670
<v Speaker 1>the Venezuelan government?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

210
00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:07.683
<v Speaker 1>you can bet that I would and not even a </v>
<v Speaker 1>single penny and precisely because no </v>

211
00:12:15.691 --> 00:12:17.760
<v Speaker 1>one in their right mind would do such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>

212
00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.640
<v Speaker 1>The Venezuelan government as hat due </v>
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>

213
00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:25.641
<v Speaker 1>This particular cryptocurrency with oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is each petro will be guaranteed by</v>

214
00:12:25.921 --> 00:12:29.280
<v Speaker 1>a barrel of oil from the Venezuelan oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves preserves.</v>

215
00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:32.370
<v Speaker 1>That of course are still undergrounds in</v>
<v Speaker 1>this way.</v>

216
00:12:32.371 --> 00:12:36.090
<v Speaker 1>If he petros value as apparently linked </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the value of this raw material</v>

217
00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:44.100
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible] and you can get fairly Paco </v>
<v Speaker 5>[inaudible].</v>

218
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:49.263
<v Speaker 1>Does that sound any better?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well hold on for either because we </v>

219
00:12:51.011 --> 00:12:52.960
<v Speaker 1>cannot forget a detail,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a very,</v>

220
00:12:52.961 --> 00:12:53.794
<v Speaker 1>very important detail.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are reserves are of course under </v>

221
00:12:56.981 --> 00:12:59.170
<v Speaker 1>the control of the government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As I wonder,</v>

222
00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:00.033
<v Speaker 1>do you really think that this government</v>
<v Speaker 1>is going to exploit those reserves and </v>

223
00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:04.053
<v Speaker 1>even if they did,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think that really back the petro </v>

224
00:13:05.890 --> 00:13:07.610
<v Speaker 1>and what about the support rates?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We didn't,</v>

225
00:13:07.630 --> 00:13:08.463
<v Speaker 1>the resources generated some DB spends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't they impose restrictions or </v>

226
00:13:11.621 --> 00:13:13.100
<v Speaker 1>regulations that would benefit?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

227
00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:14.093
<v Speaker 2>Them.</v>

228
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.780
<v Speaker 1>Why take the risk of investing in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Petros?</v>

229
00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:21.510
<v Speaker 1>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another important point here that petro,</v>

230
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:22.373
<v Speaker 1>it's not convertible.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say even though it is </v>

231
00:13:23.821 --> 00:13:27.600
<v Speaker 1>supposedly backed by oil barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can never exchange it for the barrel</v>

232
00:13:27.660 --> 00:13:31.020
<v Speaker 1>or any title that proves a right over </v>
<v Speaker 1>those barrels.</v>

233
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.840
<v Speaker 1>The Petros a cryptocurrency that isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>crypto,</v>

234
00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:36.030
<v Speaker 1>that it's backed by reserves that aren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>reserves.</v>

235
00:13:36.110 --> 00:13:39.750
<v Speaker 1>It's going only be monetized or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>production that is collapsing and issued</v>

236
00:13:39.751 --> 00:13:42.720
<v Speaker 1>by a government that is in default and </v>
<v Speaker 1>has no dollars.</v>

237
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:45.660
<v Speaker 1>Francisco Menotti,</v>
<v Speaker 1>professor at the rice universities,</v>

238
00:13:45.690 --> 00:13:47.670
<v Speaker 1>Baker Institute in Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>

239
00:13:47.700 --> 00:13:50.400
<v Speaker 1>the battery doesn't seem to be anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a last ditch.</v>

240
00:13:50.401 --> 00:13:51.234
<v Speaker 1>Attempts to gain time and try to obtain </v>
<v Speaker 1>the greatest possible number of dollars </v>

241
00:13:54.271 --> 00:13:55.104
<v Speaker 1>by taking advantage of the popularity of</v>
<v Speaker 1>cryptocurrencies and perhaps of capitol </v>

242
00:13:58.771 --> 00:13:59.604
<v Speaker 1>laundering because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would put their dollars on the </v>

243
00:14:01.501 --> 00:14:02.334
<v Speaker 1>table?</v>

244
00:14:06.550 --> 00:14:08.580
<v Speaker 1>Fact is that if this crypto it doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>work in,</v>

245
00:14:08.581 --> 00:14:11.700
<v Speaker 1>that does look like the most plausible </v>
<v Speaker 1>scenario Madora his regime.</v>

246
00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.660
<v Speaker 1>Well only have three options.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

247
00:14:13.661 --> 00:14:17.190
<v Speaker 1>accept some kind of internal revolts and</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave power one way or another,</v>

248
00:14:17.191 --> 00:14:18.024
<v Speaker 1>which seems very difficult.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second views and even tougher hands and </v>

249
00:14:20.581 --> 00:14:24.510
<v Speaker 1>condemn Venezuela to even greater </v>
<v Speaker 1>humanitarian disaster or third,</v>

250
00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:25.373
<v Speaker 1>try to get the Chinese and Russians to </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the country's national resources on </v>

251
00:14:28.261 --> 00:14:31.140
<v Speaker 1>mass hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By all means trust that refineries,</v>

252
00:14:31.170 --> 00:14:32.003
<v Speaker 1>that oil and maybe other raw materials.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say they would essentially </v>

253
00:14:34.591 --> 00:14:35.424
<v Speaker 1>become a sort of colony by selling at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss each and every one of their crown </v>

254
00:14:38.971 --> 00:14:39.804
<v Speaker 1>jewels so that the regimes are leads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can continue to enjoy their standard of </v>

255
00:14:42.481 --> 00:14:43.530
<v Speaker 1>living.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now today,</v>

256
00:14:43.531 --> 00:14:44.364
<v Speaker 1>Nicolas Maduro in company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're still in power and it hardly </v>

257
00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:49.500
<v Speaker 1>seems likely the Venezuela is going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>have a better future,</v>

258
00:14:49.530 --> 00:14:50.363
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Would you be willing to exchange your </v>

259
00:14:51.951 --> 00:14:52.784
<v Speaker 1>money for that?</v>
