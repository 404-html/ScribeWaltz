1
00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.050
<v Speaker 1>Why are some countries rich and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>pour?</v>

2
00:00:12.051 --> 00:00:13.820
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it sounds like an easy question,</v>

3
00:00:13.821 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 1>but nothing could be further from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>

4
00:00:15.891 --> 00:00:19.250
<v Speaker 1>There in fact is the origin of wealth is</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the key issues.</v>

5
00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.610
<v Speaker 1>If north of the most important issue in </v>
<v Speaker 1>political debates,</v>

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.300
<v Speaker 2>they're three and a half million more </v>
<v Speaker 2>women living in poverty today,</v>

7
00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.660
<v Speaker 2>the one that president took office.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We don't have to live like this.</v>

8
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:30.793
<v Speaker 2>I want to give middleclass families and </v>
<v Speaker 2>folks who were striving to give the </v>

9
00:00:33.741 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 2>middle class some leaf,</v>

10
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.050
<v Speaker 1>all the poor countries poor because </v>
<v Speaker 1>there are rich countries.</v>

11
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:38.903
<v Speaker 1>Do the richest countries have any </v>
<v Speaker 1>special geographical characteristics </v>

12
00:00:42.041 --> 00:00:43.900
<v Speaker 1>that determine their success?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

13
00:00:43.901 --> 00:00:46.360
<v Speaker 1>natural resources for source of wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

14
00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.510
<v Speaker 1>their inhabitants smarter or most </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly of all,</v>

15
00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:53.890
<v Speaker 1>is there some limited amount of wealth </v>
<v Speaker 1>that we simply have to distribute?</v>

16
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.733
<v Speaker 3>What does,</v>

17
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.903
<v Speaker 1>if you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the answer to all of those questions </v>

18
00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:08.224
<v Speaker 1>was a yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we could say that our luckiest set </v>

19
00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>and we simply can't change it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we're rich,</v>

20
00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:14.680
<v Speaker 1>great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if we're poor,</v>

21
00:01:14.681 --> 00:01:15.514
<v Speaker 1>apparently there are only two paths.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Either we quits or we put our trust in </v>

22
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:24.370
<v Speaker 1>some sorts of Messianic leader who </v>
<v Speaker 1>promises us some kinds of revolution.</v>

23
00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:25.810
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these revolutions,</v>

24
00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:28.750
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they almost always ends up making things</v>

25
00:01:28.751 --> 00:01:29.860
<v Speaker 1>much worse.</v>

26
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.470
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible] Rico said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know,</v>

27
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:35.950
<v Speaker 2>but just all during my mind,</v>

28
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.320
<v Speaker 1>I actually think that this approach is </v>
<v Speaker 1>missing something melt.</v>

29
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:41.020
<v Speaker 1>Honestly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think it's missing rather,</v>

30
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.680
<v Speaker 1>and lots of things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Obviously folks,</v>

31
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.000
<v Speaker 1>many factors determine whether a country</v>
<v Speaker 1>is rich or whether it is porn,</v>

32
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.120
<v Speaker 1>and in this video we're going to focus </v>
<v Speaker 1>on one of the factors.</v>

33
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.013
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably one of the most important </v>

34
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:55.850
<v Speaker 1>issues of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'll will do so by taking a look at the</v>

35
00:01:55.851 --> 00:01:58.460
<v Speaker 1>history of the entire American </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent.</v>

36
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.520
<v Speaker 1>So listen up America versus America.</v>

37
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.970
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

38
00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.180
<v Speaker 1>America one consonance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two very different realities.</v>

39
00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 1>Some countries are very rich and others </v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor.</v>

40
00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.780
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>check out Canada's park capita income,</v>

41
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.190
<v Speaker 1>even taking a price difference into </v>
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>

42
00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.600
<v Speaker 1>It is five times that of El Salvador or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ecuador.</v>

43
00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.523
<v Speaker 1>Then consider the fact that the per </v>
<v Speaker 1>capita income in the U S is four times </v>

44
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:31.540
<v Speaker 1>higher than it is in Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

45
00:02:31.541 --> 00:02:32.374
<v Speaker 1>it's true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And there's also a group of countries </v>

46
00:02:33.311 --> 00:02:36.970
<v Speaker 1>that we could describe in relative terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>as sort of middle class.</v>

47
00:02:36.971 --> 00:02:37.804
<v Speaker 1>We've got Chili and Panama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The income is three times that of </v>

48
00:02:40.451 --> 00:02:43.450
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia and almost double that of Peru.</v>

49
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.410
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

50
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:49.243
<v Speaker 1>Broadly speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the 1 billion people living in the </v>

51
00:02:51.561 --> 00:02:52.394
<v Speaker 1>America is approximately 40% lift in </v>
<v Speaker 1>some of the richest countries in the </v>

52
00:02:55.731 --> 00:02:58.460
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mainly the United States and Canada.</v>

53
00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.353
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the other 60% of Americans live in </v>

54
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:06.421
<v Speaker 1>countries that are either very poor or </v>
<v Speaker 1>are still developing and of course faced</v>

55
00:03:09.761 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 1>with this panorama.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>

56
00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.573
<v Speaker 1>why on earth is there such a contrast </v>
<v Speaker 1>between for two great North American </v>

57
00:03:16.691 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 1>powers under the rest of the consonants </v>
<v Speaker 1>or even why are the countries located at</v>

58
00:03:20.981 --> 00:03:23.150
<v Speaker 1>both ends of the continents?</v>
<v Speaker 1>January richer?</v>

59
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.670
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just check out this map.</v>

60
00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:27.280
<v Speaker 1>The countries that are painted with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>darker color,</v>

61
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.653
<v Speaker 1>Richard.</v>

62
00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.350
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

63
00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:33.183
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it may be easier to notice the enormous </v>

64
00:03:35.591 --> 00:03:36.424
<v Speaker 1>difference writes on the board of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You're seeing donald trump's favorite </v>

65
00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:39.970
<v Speaker 1>border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

66
00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:45.060
<v Speaker 1>the one between the United States and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico on the north side of the border.</v>

67
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:50.290
<v Speaker 1>We do have the u s one of the wealthiest</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries in the world.</v>

68
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.183
<v Speaker 1>I come three where in general its </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants are much richer and it's </v>

69
00:03:54.051 --> 00:03:54.884
<v Speaker 1>much safer and they live longer lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>than those on the southern side of the </v>

70
00:03:58.421 --> 00:04:00.580
<v Speaker 1>border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who live in Mexico,</v>

71
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.630
<v Speaker 1>in fact one crosses the border and </v>
<v Speaker 1>suddenly everything changes.</v>

72
00:04:04.631 --> 00:04:05.464
<v Speaker 1>Right.</v>

73
00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.350
<v Speaker 4>Bye.</v>

74
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.120
<v Speaker 1>Why such a difference?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

75
00:04:09.121 --> 00:04:09.954
<v Speaker 1>because at the end of the day we're </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about territories that have a </v>

76
00:04:12.691 --> 00:04:15.840
<v Speaker 1>very similar population and its natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources.</v>

77
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.020
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget that much of California,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas and New Mexico,</v>

78
00:04:19.021 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>some of these states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way are the most prosperous</v>

79
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:23.034
<v Speaker 1>and innovative in the United States when</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexican at the beginning of the 19th </v>

80
00:04:26.431 --> 00:04:27.264
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

81
00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.890
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

82
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.723
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the people that you manage to cross </v>

83
00:04:30.421 --> 00:04:31.254
<v Speaker 1>from south of the border to the north </v>
<v Speaker 1>have quite high employment and </v>

84
00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:34.794
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship rates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So of course we're not talking about </v>

85
00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:39.070
<v Speaker 1>racial or religious motives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

86
00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.680
<v Speaker 1>Then why on earth does this huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>contrast exist between the north and the</v>

87
00:04:45.681 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 1>south of the border?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

88
00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.420
<v Speaker 1>you might be thinking right now that </v>
<v Speaker 1>obviously it's because they've had worse</v>

89
00:04:50.421 --> 00:04:53.150
<v Speaker 1>governments and worse politicians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I mean,</v>

90
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.013
<v Speaker 1>where did that come from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did almost all the countries south of </v>

91
00:04:56.451 --> 00:05:00.260
<v Speaker 1>the u s Mexico border just simply have </v>
<v Speaker 1>this sort of bad luck?</v>

92
00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.020
<v Speaker 1>Is that not another factor involved?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

93
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.080
<v Speaker 1>listen up here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different destinations Devi,</v>

94
00:05:11.121 --> 00:05:14.510
<v Speaker 1>you are to continue in the video today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we really need to take a small trip.</v>

95
00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.890
<v Speaker 1>We need to go back to the year 1600 </v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine there are two brothers,</v>

96
00:05:18.891 --> 00:05:20.940
<v Speaker 1>John and his pizza who,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or a balanced,</v>

97
00:05:20.941 --> 00:05:25.070
<v Speaker 1>we embark on the American adventure from</v>
<v Speaker 1>some European pause.</v>

98
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.120
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to fate,</v>

99
00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:27.560
<v Speaker 1>they ended up on different books.</v>

100
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.870
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

101
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:32.810
<v Speaker 1>One of the brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>John left in such a fortune in Mexico,</v>

102
00:05:32.811 --> 00:05:33.644
<v Speaker 1>while pizza got on a ship that was </v>
<v Speaker 1>heading farther north to what later </v>

103
00:05:36.261 --> 00:05:39.440
<v Speaker 1>became known as New England's and today </v>
<v Speaker 1>corresponds to the states.</v>

104
00:05:39.441 --> 00:05:40.720
<v Speaker 1>If New Hampshire,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Connecticut,</v>

105
00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:41.900
<v Speaker 1>Massachusetts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Vermont,</v>

106
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.220
<v Speaker 1>Maine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Rhode Island.</v>

107
00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.233
<v Speaker 3>Okay?</v>

108
00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.093
<v Speaker 1>And you might be picking it up now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is indeed one of the richest </v>

109
00:05:48.321 --> 00:05:50.030
<v Speaker 1>areas in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

110
00:05:50.031 --> 00:05:50.864
<v Speaker 1>the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you'd been in these two brothers </v>

111
00:05:52.401 --> 00:05:54.710
<v Speaker 1>places,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ship would you have preferred?</v>

112
00:05:54.711 --> 00:05:58.670
<v Speaker 1>The one that was going to Mexico or the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one that was to New England's to Boston?</v>

113
00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.960
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>viewer,</v>

114
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:00.853
<v Speaker 1>for those of you who answered Boston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you should rather reconsider </v>

115
00:06:04.251 --> 00:06:05.084
<v Speaker 1>your decision at the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Things they couldn't have been more </v>

116
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.090
<v Speaker 1>different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

117
00:06:08.091 --> 00:06:10.130
<v Speaker 1>John,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he arrived in Mexico City,</v>

118
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.380
<v Speaker 1>a city full of monuments in new </v>
<v Speaker 1>buildings,</v>

119
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.920
<v Speaker 1>a city that had nothing to envy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>European cities,</v>

120
00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:18.273
<v Speaker 1>but that's how I'm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico was part of the vice royalty of </v>

121
00:06:20.271 --> 00:06:22.880
<v Speaker 1>new Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an area of expensive governance that was</v>

122
00:06:22.881 --> 00:06:24.860
<v Speaker 1>full of wonders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cultivated fields,</v>

123
00:06:24.861 --> 00:06:27.920
<v Speaker 1>ancient civilization ruins large cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

124
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.790
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But Peta,</v>

125
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.800
<v Speaker 1>he arrived in a cold,</v>
<v Speaker 1>desolate,</v>

126
00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.053
<v Speaker 1>unpopulated area,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a place without infrastructure where </v>

127
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:39.920
<v Speaker 1>mere survival was something of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenge.</v>

128
00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.530
<v Speaker 1>It was a place where real hunger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>true cold,</v>

129
00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:43.393
<v Speaker 1>we're raging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually the Spanish conquerors didn't </v>

130
00:06:45.051 --> 00:06:48.110
<v Speaker 1>move further north because there was no </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth to extract that</v>

131
00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.820
<v Speaker 5>chose North America.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Not because it was attractive,</v>

132
00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:54.410
<v Speaker 5>but because it was all that was </v>
<v Speaker 5>available,</v>

133
00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:55.273
<v Speaker 5>but desirable parts of the Americas </v>
<v Speaker 5>where the indigenous population to </v>

134
00:06:57.891 --> 00:06:58.724
<v Speaker 5>exploit was plentiful and where the gold</v>
<v Speaker 5>and silver mines were located had </v>

135
00:07:02.151 --> 00:07:05.480
<v Speaker 5>already been occupied.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The English got the leftovers,</v>

136
00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:06.311
<v Speaker 5>Darren,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Asimo,</v>

137
00:07:06.311 --> 00:07:09.770
<v Speaker 5>Lou and James Robinson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Why nations fail</v>

138
00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:10.683
<v Speaker 1>in New England,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one how to work very hard just to </v>

139
00:07:12.611 --> 00:07:17.510
<v Speaker 1>survive in the south.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However things they were difference,</v>

140
00:07:17.511 --> 00:07:18.344
<v Speaker 1>there were many natural riches.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The climate's was much better for </v>

141
00:07:20.661 --> 00:07:21.494
<v Speaker 1>agriculture and so there was a large </v>
<v Speaker 1>local population used by the Spanish </v>

142
00:07:24.411 --> 00:07:25.244
<v Speaker 1>conquistadores to do endless hours of </v>
<v Speaker 1>work in exchange for practically </v>

143
00:07:28.551 --> 00:07:29.384
<v Speaker 1>nothing.</v>

144
00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:33.490
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that all of these resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>

145
00:07:33.491 --> 00:07:37.680
<v Speaker 1>so that many of those who arrived didn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>have to work in order to survive,</v>

146
00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.620
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the institutions that existed in</v>

147
00:07:40.621 --> 00:07:41.454
<v Speaker 1>old Europe could be easily replicated.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These were institutions like the </v>

148
00:07:44.581 --> 00:07:45.414
<v Speaker 1>aristocracy and bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the officials or the royal </v>

149
00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:49.584
<v Speaker 1>favors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which were privileges granted by the </v>

150
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:53.310
<v Speaker 1>state and to which benefits is only a </v>
<v Speaker 1>select few.</v>

151
00:07:53.311 --> 00:07:55.210
<v Speaker 1>These include things like commercial </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopolies,</v>

152
00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.610
<v Speaker 1>land distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mining,</v>

153
00:07:56.611 --> 00:07:58.170
<v Speaker 1>exploitation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

154
00:07:58.290 --> 00:07:59.760
<v Speaker 1>That way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's all by Lisel.</v>

155
00:07:59.790 --> 00:08:00.623
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a culture was born in which work and </v>

156
00:08:02.941 --> 00:08:03.774
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're not perceived as the best way to </v>

157
00:08:05.971 --> 00:08:07.110
<v Speaker 1>prospect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

158
00:08:07.111 --> 00:08:07.944
<v Speaker 1>people just needed to make good </v>
<v Speaker 1>connections with those who were in </v>

159
00:08:10.201 --> 00:08:11.011
<v Speaker 1>power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

160
00:08:11.011 --> 00:08:11.844
<v Speaker 1>why risk investing when you can just </v>
<v Speaker 1>hold out your hand for a handout and </v>

161
00:08:14.071 --> 00:08:14.904
<v Speaker 1>then on the other hands in elite class </v>
<v Speaker 1>was formed by people who lived based on </v>

162
00:08:17.461 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 1>the resources that others extracted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lived through privileges,</v>

163
00:08:20.821 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 1>forced exploitation of the natives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lans,</v>

164
00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:24.390
<v Speaker 1>distribution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>concessions,</v>

165
00:08:24.391 --> 00:08:25.890
<v Speaker 1>public revenues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>taxes,</v>

166
00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.783
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

167
00:08:29.040 --> 00:08:32.700
<v Speaker 1>This was an elite class by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which based on the standards of the time</v>

168
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.563
<v Speaker 1>lived at full speed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which meant having to extract more and </v>

169
00:08:36.091 --> 00:08:36.924
<v Speaker 1>more resources from the others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This meant that this elite group that's </v>

170
00:08:39.271 --> 00:08:41.520
<v Speaker 1>controlled the economic resources not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only to,</v>

171
00:08:41.521 --> 00:08:44.970
<v Speaker 1>didn't have to worry about investing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovating or taking risks,</v>

172
00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000
<v Speaker 1>they actually placed obstacles for other</v>
<v Speaker 1>people and give you this culture.</v>

173
00:08:51.810 --> 00:08:52.643
<v Speaker 1>It didn't disappear with independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It simply remains consolidating some of </v>

174
00:08:55.741 --> 00:09:00.270
<v Speaker 1>the most remarkable characteristics of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America and elite class with a lot</v>

175
00:09:00.271 --> 00:09:02.940
<v Speaker 1>of wealth that is based on obtaining </v>
<v Speaker 1>wrens overlords,</v>

176
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:06.150
<v Speaker 1>a lot of bureaucracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they shattered social elevator.</v>

177
00:09:06.210 --> 00:09:07.380
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the north,</v>

178
00:09:07.410 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 1>things were going completely </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

179
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.400
<v Speaker 3>The survival</v>

180
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>unlike was happens in the south of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>north,</v>

181
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.950
<v Speaker 1>had no resources and no indigenous </v>
<v Speaker 1>population to exploit it,</v>

182
00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:28.590
<v Speaker 1>so there was no other option,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to work hard,</v>

183
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:32.120
<v Speaker 1>invest and innovate in order to improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>the standard of living.</v>

184
00:09:32.121 --> 00:09:32.954
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thus the social climate and the </v>

185
00:09:35.251 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>institutions that were developed were </v>
<v Speaker 1>very,</v>

186
00:09:37.291 --> 00:09:41.100
<v Speaker 1>very different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Physical hard work was well regarded and</v>

187
00:09:41.190 --> 00:09:42.023
<v Speaker 1>not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because since these territories were </v>

188
00:09:43.141 --> 00:09:48.120
<v Speaker 1>very poor and practically depopulated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had a lot of political and economic</v>

189
00:09:48.121 --> 00:09:51.710
<v Speaker 1>autonomy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually at first,</v>

190
00:09:51.711 --> 00:09:54.410
<v Speaker 1>the British crown didn't really care </v>
<v Speaker 1>much about these colonies.</v>

191
00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:55.273
<v Speaker 1>They were more concerned about what was </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening in other parts of the empire </v>

192
00:09:57.831 --> 00:09:59.810
<v Speaker 1>where things were more lucrative.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

193
00:09:59.811 --> 00:10:00.644
<v Speaker 1>it was only when these colonies begins a</v>
<v Speaker 1>prosper that the crown that started to </v>

194
00:10:02.691 --> 00:10:03.524
<v Speaker 1>pay attention to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that the crown began to </v>

195
00:10:05.271 --> 00:10:09.380
<v Speaker 1>establish political and economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls as well as introduced taxes.</v>

196
00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.273
<v Speaker 1>And as we all know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the settlers didn't take that lying </v>

197
00:10:12.021 --> 00:10:12.854
<v Speaker 1>down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

198
00:10:14.710 --> 00:10:15.390
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

199
00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.223
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often said that the u s war of </v>

200
00:10:17.461 --> 00:10:19.980
<v Speaker 1>independence was a fight to obtain </v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom.</v>

201
00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:20.873
<v Speaker 1>However many of the incentives that led </v>
<v Speaker 1>them to fight it more to do with </v>

202
00:10:23.371 --> 00:10:24.204
<v Speaker 1>maintaining the freedom,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they were already used to and which </v>

203
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.190
<v Speaker 1>they were no longer willing to give up</v>

204
00:10:33.400 --> 00:10:34.233
<v Speaker 1>once they obtained their independence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They worried a lot about making sure </v>

205
00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:41.150
<v Speaker 1>that neither of their liberties nor that</v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial capacities were at risk.</v>

206
00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:43.040
<v Speaker 1>But some of you might be thinking right </v>
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>

207
00:10:43.041 --> 00:10:43.874
<v Speaker 1>well Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a minute because the offer </v>

208
00:10:45.411 --> 00:10:47.180
<v Speaker 1>guessing about slavery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

209
00:10:47.210 --> 00:10:49.580
<v Speaker 1>actually I'm not because the slave </v>
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>

210
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:50.443
<v Speaker 1>they weren't actually the richest </v>
<v Speaker 1>slavery enriched a few at the great </v>

211
00:10:53.811 --> 00:10:55.730
<v Speaker 1>expense of others.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

212
00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.583
<v Speaker 1>if instead we talked about two companies</v>
<v Speaker 1>instead of two brothers in the long </v>

213
00:10:59.471 --> 00:11:01.610
<v Speaker 1>term,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would have been much better to invest</v>

214
00:11:01.640 --> 00:11:04.190
<v Speaker 1>in the one in Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The keys to development.</v>

215
00:11:04.191 --> 00:11:05.024
<v Speaker 1>They don't lie in the natural resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a country or in the exploitation of </v>

216
00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:10.850
<v Speaker 1>anyone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They lie in ingenuity,</v>

217
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:12.890
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial spirit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in work.</v>

218
00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:15.950
<v Speaker 1>That's why when politicians make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>process difficult,</v>

219
00:11:15.951 --> 00:11:17.570
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with taxes,</v>

220
00:11:17.571 --> 00:11:18.404
<v Speaker 1>a strong state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>lots of bureaucracy or privileges for </v>

221
00:11:20.691 --> 00:11:21.524
<v Speaker 1>their friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results that are always really bad </v>

222
00:11:24.230 --> 00:11:25.063
<v Speaker 1>in a way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's similar to what happens with the </v>

223
00:11:26.601 --> 00:11:31.601
<v Speaker 1>natural resources.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can help,</v>

224
00:11:32.130 --> 00:11:36.090
<v Speaker 1>but they aren't enough to generate real </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth because they're all very rich.</v>

225
00:11:36.091 --> 00:11:36.924
<v Speaker 1>Countries that hardly have any natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources like Japan or Singapore and </v>

226
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.690
<v Speaker 1>others with many resources but are </v>
<v Speaker 1>incredibly poor like Venezuela.</v>

227
00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:47.700
<v Speaker 1>Ingenuity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>work and capital are more important than</v>

228
00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:49.080
<v Speaker 1>any natural resource.</v>

229
00:11:50.690 --> 00:11:51.140
<v Speaker 3>Good.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The good news</v>

230
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:52.820
<v Speaker 1>here is that poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not,</v>

231
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:54.303
<v Speaker 1>and you can't escape it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trajectories such as those seen in </v>

232
00:11:56.651 --> 00:11:57.484
<v Speaker 1>countries like Chile or Panama or in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent decades showing with that things </v>

233
00:12:00.610 --> 00:12:03.230
<v Speaker 1>absolutely can change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but always the,</v>

234
00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:07.420
<v Speaker 1>and do you think we'll soon see an </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic takeoff in Latin America?</v>

235
