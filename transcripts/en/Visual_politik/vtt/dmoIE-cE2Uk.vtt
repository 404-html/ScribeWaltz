<v Speaker 1>Donald trump's unexpected presidential.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the rejection of the peace </v>

2
00:00:03.391 --> 00:00:06.090
<v Speaker 1>agreement between the Colombian </v>
<v Speaker 1>government and the FARC,</v>

3
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.570
<v Speaker 1>the surprise Brexit victory folks 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>what was the uh,</v>

4
00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:11.513
<v Speaker 1>in which forecasts fails?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it was precisely then there's an </v>

5
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.910
<v Speaker 1>ever present and very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

6
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.080
<v Speaker 1>Rose.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

7
00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.180
<v Speaker 1>all surveys useful ver anything and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>what extent can we trust these surveys?</v>

8
00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:34.283
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

9
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.680
<v Speaker 1>In a world where information is readily </v>
<v Speaker 1>available,</v>

10
00:00:36.681 --> 00:00:39.890
<v Speaker 1>everywhere and changes are happening at </v>
<v Speaker 1>a dizzying pace,</v>

11
00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.680
<v Speaker 1>pulse have become a political and </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial weapon,</v>

12
00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.270
<v Speaker 1>whether it's to gain votes or to sell </v>
<v Speaker 1>products.</v>

13
00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:47.660
<v Speaker 1>Getting to new voters or customer's </v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes,</v>

14
00:00:47.661 --> 00:00:50.960
<v Speaker 1>preferences and concerns is usually </v>
<v Speaker 1>highly recommended.</v>

15
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.250
<v Speaker 1>I believe me.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

16
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.210
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>

17
00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:58.613
<v Speaker 1>John F.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was the first White House </v>

18
00:00:59.461 --> 00:01:04.230
<v Speaker 1>candidate who used and relied on poles </v>
<v Speaker 1>to prepare his campaign strategy.</v>

19
00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.123
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy's team systematically used </v>
<v Speaker 1>surveys to discovering and analyze </v>

20
00:01:08.251 --> 00:01:09.084
<v Speaker 1>voters opinions and concerns in such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they'd be able to adapt to the </v>

21
00:01:12.361 --> 00:01:15.840
<v Speaker 1>future president's political discourse </v>
<v Speaker 1>do these very issues.</v>

22
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:16.713
<v Speaker 1>Very example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the surveys with which the </v>

23
00:01:17.821 --> 00:01:18.654
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy team works revealed that only </v>
<v Speaker 1>30% of families could send their </v>

24
00:01:22.111 --> 00:01:22.944
<v Speaker 1>children to university.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But that 80% of families still dreamed </v>

25
00:01:25.981 --> 00:01:28.070
<v Speaker 1>of being able to do that someday.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

26
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.600
<v Speaker 1>can you guess what Kennedy did off the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last?</v>

27
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.381
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

28
00:01:31.381 --> 00:01:32.214
<v Speaker 1>He insisted in his features a gain in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the game that education was a priority </v>

29
00:01:35.401 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>for him and that he would improve </v>
<v Speaker 1>trading opportunities for every family's</v>

30
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:42.090
<v Speaker 1>children while the public,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they responded to this message,</v>

31
00:01:42.091 --> 00:01:42.820
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

32
00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.400
<v Speaker 3>if we're going to absorb the new </v>
<v Speaker 3>technology,</v>

33
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.323
<v Speaker 3>we're going to have the have the path </v>
<v Speaker 3>train people in the world and they're </v>

34
00:01:48.731 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 3>going to come out of this state and the </v>
<v Speaker 3>other 49 states</v>

35
00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.010
<v Speaker 1>that was an old,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

36
00:01:53.011 --> 00:01:53.844
<v Speaker 1>John F.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was Catholic and this wasn't </v>

37
00:01:55.231 --> 00:01:57.600
<v Speaker 1>very well received and the Protestant </v>
<v Speaker 1>regions,</v>

38
00:01:57.601 --> 00:02:00.870
<v Speaker 1>which is why many Protestant voters </v>
<v Speaker 1>weren't willing to vote for him.</v>

39
00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Kennedy team decided to use the </v>

40
00:02:02.761 --> 00:02:03.594
<v Speaker 1>polls to decide which states the </v>
<v Speaker 1>candidate would visit during the </v>

41
00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:06.924
<v Speaker 1>presidential campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That way they left out new less than 30 </v>

42
00:02:09.631 --> 00:02:10.464
<v Speaker 1>states,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them precisely because of the </v>

43
00:02:11.641 --> 00:02:14.580
<v Speaker 1>voters reluctance to vote for a Catholic</v>
<v Speaker 1>Candida's.</v>

44
00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.210
<v Speaker 1>Thus the Kennedy campaigns in was able </v>
<v Speaker 1>to concentrate all of its efforts on the</v>

45
00:02:18.211 --> 00:02:22.260
<v Speaker 1>states where they had a shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you definitely know,</v>

46
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.350
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy became president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>

47
00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:35.520
<v Speaker 1>polls I powerful weapon for drawing </v>
<v Speaker 1>political and business strategies.</v>

48
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.383
<v Speaker 1>That's why since Kennedy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of politicians have </v>

49
00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:43.800
<v Speaker 1>had a great fondness for surveys and </v>
<v Speaker 1>demographic studies because well,</v>

50
00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:44.723
<v Speaker 1>knowledge is power and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the polls have also acquired another </v>

51
00:02:48.301 --> 00:02:49.134
<v Speaker 1>ability,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ability to influence the decision </v>

52
00:02:51.061 --> 00:02:54.900
<v Speaker 1>making process.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is polls can actually gain votes or</v>

53
00:02:54.901 --> 00:02:59.901
<v Speaker 1>clients by themselves,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether by useful voting,</v>

54
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.510
<v Speaker 1>compromising,</v>
<v Speaker 1>coattail effect of voting.</v>

55
00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:04.383
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't really matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually when a survey says that </v>

56
00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:07.024
<v Speaker 1>something is in high demand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's natural demand tends to grow even </v>

57
00:03:10.301 --> 00:03:12.790
<v Speaker 1>though it may never reach the savvis </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels.</v>

58
00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:13.713
<v Speaker 1>It's exactly due to this effect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's Paula stations and many </v>

59
00:03:15.521 --> 00:03:16.354
<v Speaker 1>companies are so addicted to </v>
<v Speaker 1>continuously making surveys of all </v>

60
00:03:18.911 --> 00:03:19.900
<v Speaker 1>kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

61
00:03:19.901 --> 00:03:22.360
<v Speaker 1>surveys on not always conducted as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be,</v>

62
00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:26.080
<v Speaker 1>and that has led to some occasional very</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge mistakes.</v>

63
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.780
<v Speaker 2>I've just received a call from Secretary</v>
<v Speaker 2>Clinton.</v>

64
00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:35.880
<v Speaker 2>The big mistakes</v>

65
00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:39.093
<v Speaker 1>the years political polls have left </v>
<v Speaker 1>behind a huge trail of flaws and </v>

66
00:03:41.711 --> 00:03:46.711
<v Speaker 1>mistakes of truly galactic proportions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps one of the best known happens in</v>

67
00:03:46.871 --> 00:03:47.704
<v Speaker 1>1936 you think presidential elections </v>
<v Speaker 1>were being held in the United States </v>

68
00:03:51.161 --> 00:03:53.830
<v Speaker 1>that year and the magazine Literary </v>
<v Speaker 1>Digest,</v>

69
00:03:53.831 --> 00:03:56.650
<v Speaker 1>which was one of the most important in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world at the time,</v>

70
00:03:56.651 --> 00:03:57.484
<v Speaker 1>carried out a macro survey was one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the largest and most expensive surveys </v>

71
00:04:01.211 --> 00:04:02.044
<v Speaker 1>of all time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The sample included almost two and a </v>

72
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:05.760
<v Speaker 1>half million people.</v>

73
00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.823
<v Speaker 2>Cool</v>

74
00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:08.173
<v Speaker 1>with Artesia in hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The magazine determines that without a </v>

75
00:04:10.251 --> 00:04:11.540
<v Speaker 1>doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alfred Landon,</v>

76
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.403
<v Speaker 1>the Republican governor of Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would become the next president of the </v>

77
00:04:15.351 --> 00:04:17.810
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He would defeat the Democrats,</v>

78
00:04:17.811 --> 00:04:20.840
<v Speaker 1>Franklin Roosevelt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by more than the 14 points.</v>

79
00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:26.000
<v Speaker 1>This is what the survey stated,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you all know the truth,</v>

80
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.630
<v Speaker 1>it was quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roosevelt's utterly destroyed his rival,</v>

81
00:04:29.631 --> 00:04:30.464
<v Speaker 1>beating him by more than 24 points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course he became the new tenant </v>

82
00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:34.214
<v Speaker 1>of the White House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since that invokes the Saturdays of the </v>

83
00:04:37.421 --> 00:04:38.254
<v Speaker 1>magazine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>literary digest are considered absolute </v>

84
00:04:40.571 --> 00:04:41.404
<v Speaker 1>nonsense.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're known to be demographic studies </v>

85
00:04:43.331 --> 00:04:46.360
<v Speaker 1>that are full of errors and plenty of </v>
<v Speaker 1>bias.</v>

86
00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:47.283
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that this magazine </v>
<v Speaker 1>surveys should have been used as a </v>

87
00:04:49.961 --> 00:04:50.794
<v Speaker 1>manual on how not to conduct surveys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't think that this was the only </v>

88
00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.320
<v Speaker 1>resoundingly mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

89
00:04:56.321 --> 00:04:58.990
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>history is littered with examples.</v>

90
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.720
<v Speaker 1>The 1948 campaign because it Harry </v>
<v Speaker 1>Truman,</v>

91
00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:03.563
<v Speaker 1>Franklin Roosevelt success,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they against the Republican New York </v>

92
00:05:05.761 --> 00:05:09.630
<v Speaker 1>State Governor Thomas Dewey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he'd become tremendously popular for his</v>

93
00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:13.590
<v Speaker 1>prosecution of organized crime,</v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically for his wall with the caper</v>

94
00:05:13.591 --> 00:05:14.424
<v Speaker 1>lucky Luciano.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that Thomas Dewey was the </v>

95
00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:20.250
<v Speaker 1>big favorite to win the elections.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All the polls presented him as the clear</v>

96
00:05:20.251 --> 00:05:24.030
<v Speaker 1>winner and even some newspapers jumped </v>
<v Speaker 1>ahead to calling him president dewey.</v>

97
00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.923
<v Speaker 1>The difference between both candidates </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemed so great so that one of the </v>

98
00:05:27.751 --> 00:05:28.584
<v Speaker 1>country's leading a survey experts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elmo roper said that he wasn't going to </v>

99
00:05:31.891 --> 00:05:35.130
<v Speaker 1>do any more poles or any surveys or </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything like that.</v>

100
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.120
<v Speaker 1>It just wasn't worth speculating on </v>
<v Speaker 1>something so incredibly obvious.</v>

101
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Dewey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he would absolutely be the president.</v>

102
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:45.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>once again,</v>

103
00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:47.100
<v Speaker 1>history is how I dealt rather </v>
<v Speaker 1>differently.</v>

104
00:05:47.130 --> 00:05:50.580
<v Speaker 1>Dreaming won the election.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By more than 2 million votes.</v>

105
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.473
<v Speaker 1>Have a look at this picture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows the United States President </v>

106
00:05:53.611 --> 00:05:54.444
<v Speaker 1>Harry Truman with a copy of the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>edition of the Chicago daily whose </v>

107
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.320
<v Speaker 1>headline reads dewey defeats Truman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

108
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.213
<v Speaker 1>The journalist's thought it was such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>safe choice that they prepared the news </v>

109
00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:05.563
<v Speaker 1>before the vote had even taken place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And at this point we'd like you to </v>

110
00:06:07.941 --> 00:06:08.774
<v Speaker 1>imagine that newspaper editors face,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just a second because these big </v>

111
00:06:12.771 --> 00:06:15.650
<v Speaker 1>mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they don't exclusively come from the u s</v>

112
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:16.543
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are the British elections of 1992 </v>

113
00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:22.220
<v Speaker 1>all polls showed a clear victory for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labour party.</v>

114
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 1>Undoubtedly often 13 years in power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the time of the conservatives,</v>

115
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.100
<v Speaker 1>it was coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But once again,</v>

116
00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.550
<v Speaker 1>the reality was quite different.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the conservative John Major,</v>

117
00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:32.443
<v Speaker 1>he took over 10 Downing Street.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So check out the huge difference here </v>

118
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.900
<v Speaker 1>between theory and reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that we could spend a lot of</v>

119
00:06:46.901 --> 00:06:50.170
<v Speaker 1>time commenting on all the macro </v>
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that surveys have made.</v>

120
00:06:50.171 --> 00:06:53.050
<v Speaker 1>But let's go back to our initial </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

121
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:57.130
<v Speaker 1>Having seen all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can we trust polls?</v>

122
00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:05.473
<v Speaker 1>Can we trust polls?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we've seen some of the biggest </v>

123
00:07:10.041 --> 00:07:13.040
<v Speaker 1>mistakes that surveys have made in our </v>
<v Speaker 1>history.</v>

124
00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:16.250
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the field has evolved a lot.</v>

125
00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:18.500
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that it's pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>

126
00:07:18.620 --> 00:07:23.620
<v Speaker 1>I mean it works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A study conducted by professors from the</v>

127
00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:25.993
<v Speaker 1>University of Southampton and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>University of Texas analyzed more than </v>

128
00:07:27.581 --> 00:07:28.414
<v Speaker 1>30,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>surveys for 351 general elections in 45 </v>

129
00:07:32.051 --> 00:07:37.051
<v Speaker 1>different countries between 1942 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>2017 study.</v>

130
00:07:38.261 --> 00:07:41.620
<v Speaker 1>The authors compared what the survey </v>
<v Speaker 1>said with what actually happens.</v>

131
00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>based on the results in is a question.</v>

132
00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:47.020
<v Speaker 1>Do you know what percentage of the more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 30,000</v>

133
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:50.860
<v Speaker 1>surveys analyzed had a failure higher </v>
<v Speaker 1>than their margin of error?</v>

134
00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:55.920
<v Speaker 1>20% 30% no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was 2% only 2% of all surveys.</v>

135
00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.173
<v Speaker 1>And in addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the results showed that accuracy has </v>

136
00:08:00.011 --> 00:08:01.320
<v Speaker 1>improved as the years have gone by.</v>

137
00:08:01.420 --> 00:08:02.253
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

138
00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.093
<v Speaker 1>But yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Donald Trump's victory against </v>

139
00:08:06.341 --> 00:08:10.090
<v Speaker 1>what the polls prophesized was for many </v>
<v Speaker 1>irrefutable proof that polls,</v>

140
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:11.290
<v Speaker 1>hi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>useless.</v>

141
00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.183
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Princeton consortium gave Hillary </v>

142
00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:14.563
<v Speaker 1>Clinton and a 99% chance of winning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>New York Times where it's a bit more </v>

143
00:08:17.291 --> 00:08:18.124
<v Speaker 1>cautious setting the probability at 85% </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe all of these things explain why </v>

144
00:08:21.761 --> 00:08:22.594
<v Speaker 1>according to polls,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ironic I know only at 26% of likely us </v>

145
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.210
<v Speaker 1>voters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's one in four trust,</v>

146
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.133
<v Speaker 1>most political polls and of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking what happened in the last </v>

147
00:08:31.871 --> 00:08:35.530
<v Speaker 1>presidential campaign into accounts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They seem to have good reason to do so.</v>

148
00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:36.423
<v Speaker 1>Right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a moment because did the </v>

149
00:08:37.391 --> 00:08:38.224
<v Speaker 1>surveys rarely fail that badly in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>while the answer may differ a bit from </v>

150
00:08:43.181 --> 00:08:44.460
<v Speaker 1>what we first saw?</v>

151
00:08:47.190 --> 00:08:47.470
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

152
00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:48.310
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true.</v>

153
00:08:48.311 --> 00:08:50.800
<v Speaker 1>The elections were won by the candidate </v>
<v Speaker 1>at the polls.</v>

154
00:08:50.801 --> 00:08:53.960
<v Speaker 1>Determined would be the loser and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>precisely due to this fact.</v>

155
00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:54.803
<v Speaker 1>There's many experts are studying what </v>
<v Speaker 1>went wrong and many theories have been </v>

156
00:08:58.350 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>put forward.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

157
00:08:59.701 --> 00:09:02.310
<v Speaker 1>what if trump's voters tend to have to </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer fewer surveys?</v>

158
00:09:02.311 --> 00:09:04.320
<v Speaker 1>What if the response rate is very low </v>
<v Speaker 1>ends?</v>

159
00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:06.660
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those who answer are accounted for.</v>

160
00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:10.140
<v Speaker 1>What if the probability of correlated </v>
<v Speaker 1>errors wasn't played out well,</v>

161
00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:11.580
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

162
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:12.503
<v Speaker 1>ans yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of these matters will pollute the </v>

163
00:09:14.281 --> 00:09:15.910
<v Speaker 1>results,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to hold on a second,</v>

164
00:09:15.960 --> 00:09:16.793
<v Speaker 1>if we take a look at the results that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the surveys had estimated that actually </v>

165
00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:25.490
<v Speaker 1>weren't that many mistakes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you see,</v>

166
00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:26.483
<v Speaker 1>the polls predicted that Hillary would </v>
<v Speaker 1>win the popular vote by about three </v>

167
00:09:29.161 --> 00:09:29.994
<v Speaker 1>points and in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hillary won the popular vote by more </v>

168
00:09:32.161 --> 00:09:33.870
<v Speaker 1>than two points,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you will know,</v>

169
00:09:33.871 --> 00:09:34.704
<v Speaker 1>the candidate with the most rights </v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't always win elections in the u s </v>

170
00:09:37.590 --> 00:09:40.380
<v Speaker 1>the one who gets the most state </v>
<v Speaker 1>delegates does.</v>

171
00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:41.243
<v Speaker 1>It was right at this point when </v>
<v Speaker 1>determining which state each candidate </v>

172
00:09:43.711 --> 00:09:47.940
<v Speaker 1>would win in the error in forecasting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the winner was caused anyway.</v>

173
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.500
<v Speaker 1>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the mistake,</v>

174
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.433
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that huge and that's taking </v>
<v Speaker 1>into account that electoral polls are </v>

175
00:09:53.251 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 1>particularly difficult,</v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps the most difficult,</v>

176
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:58.300
<v Speaker 1>not only because we need to determine </v>
<v Speaker 1>the favorite candidates,</v>

177
00:09:58.320 --> 00:10:02.490
<v Speaker 1>but also how many of the people </v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed will eventually vote and how</v>

178
00:10:02.491 --> 00:10:06.690
<v Speaker 1>they'll vote on that precise day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth folks is that surveys are very</v>

179
00:10:06.691 --> 00:10:07.524
<v Speaker 1>accurate when it comes to determining </v>
<v Speaker 1>what the general perception of a </v>

180
00:10:09.841 --> 00:10:10.674
<v Speaker 1>particular issue or subject is and fast </v>
<v Speaker 1>why they're so important for both </v>

181
00:10:13.891 --> 00:10:17.820
<v Speaker 1>politicians and for companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they may include a few mistakes.</v>

182
00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:18.654
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>survey results come with a margin of </v>

183
00:10:19.951 --> 00:10:21.990
<v Speaker 1>error include included,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as we've seen,</v>

184
00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:22.824
<v Speaker 1>the evidence tells us that the real </v>
<v Speaker 1>result in the vast majority of cases is </v>

185
00:10:25.981 --> 00:10:28.110
<v Speaker 1>usually within that margin of error.</v>

186
00:10:28.170 --> 00:10:31.110
<v Speaker 1>And also that's not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>forget how important trends are.</v>

187
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.753
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's like a thermometer and ground via </v>

188
00:10:34.711 --> 00:10:37.380
<v Speaker 1>Madrid,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which says 600 degrees Fahrenheit.</v>

189
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.273
<v Speaker 1>It's wrong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you walk by tomorrow and it says </v>

190
00:10:40.231 --> 00:10:42.990
<v Speaker 1>650 degrees Fahrenheit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you know one thing,</v>

191
00:10:43.230 --> 00:10:47.160
<v Speaker 1>it's hotter than yesterday,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pablo Seaman Politiken but now it's your</v>

192
00:10:47.161 --> 00:10:49.230
<v Speaker 1>turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you trust the polls?</v>
