1
00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.473
<v Speaker 1>Every time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>less than American government tries to </v>

2
00:00:09.711 --> 00:00:10.544
<v Speaker 1>discuss foreign policy and development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they ended up discussing regional </v>

3
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.384
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is why we should understand the </v>

4
00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:18.950
<v Speaker 1>three main common features of Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>

5
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.020
<v Speaker 1>football,</v>
<v Speaker 1>soccer for you Americans,</v>

6
00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.770
<v Speaker 1>revolutions and the regional </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

7
00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.690
<v Speaker 1>Seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're really not kidding here.</v>

8
00:00:26.691 --> 00:00:27.524
<v Speaker 1>In the last few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been so many regional </v>

9
00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:30.464
<v Speaker 1>organizations that it is almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible to know what goals each of </v>

10
00:00:33.651 --> 00:00:34.484
<v Speaker 1>them have besides obviously being an </v>
<v Speaker 1>excuse for spending money on public </v>

11
00:00:37.431 --> 00:00:40.970
<v Speaker 1>workers headquarters and traveling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are unison,</v>

12
00:00:40.971 --> 00:00:42.470
<v Speaker 1>Mercosur,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Albert Caricom,</v>

13
00:00:42.471 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Sanilac Ld,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indian community seekers,</v>

14
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:46.130
<v Speaker 1>seller,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Rio Group,</v>

15
00:00:46.131 --> 00:00:48.710
<v Speaker 1>and of course the Organization of </v>
<v Speaker 1>American States,</v>

16
00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:49.723
<v Speaker 1>and to be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm probably not even mentioning all of </v>

17
00:00:52.611 --> 00:00:53.444
<v Speaker 1>them there anyway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once you hear about all of these </v>

18
00:00:54.681 --> 00:00:55.514
<v Speaker 1>organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be thinking the Latin America </v>

19
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:59.630
<v Speaker 1>is the place where people get on with </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other.</v>

20
00:00:59.631 --> 00:01:00.464
<v Speaker 1>The best.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A place where it's really easy to do </v>

21
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.830
<v Speaker 1>business among the different countries.</v>

22
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.693
<v Speaker 1>I'm where governments work together for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the common good in some sort of </v>

23
00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:09.590
<v Speaker 1>wonderful paradise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

24
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.680
<v Speaker 1>When all the bad news is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you didn't guess that none of that is</v>

25
00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:14.810
<v Speaker 1>true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of these organizations,</v>

26
00:01:14.811 --> 00:01:17.300
<v Speaker 1>they were born with these really </v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful home ideas,</v>

27
00:01:17.301 --> 00:01:18.134
<v Speaker 1>but we could say they all really did </v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing for developments and economic </v>

28
00:01:21.321 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>and political integration in Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>

29
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.023
<v Speaker 1>New institutions are created,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't clear what to do with the </v>

30
00:01:28.281 --> 00:01:30.890
<v Speaker 1>previous ones.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is an endless fight forward.</v>

31
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>Carlos mood look just by all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different processes of integration.</v>

32
00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:38.780
<v Speaker 1>Trade is strangely low among these </v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries.</v>

33
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:41.373
<v Speaker 1>Those are important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet the share of exports inside the </v>

34
00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:44.284
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It hasn't changed much and it has been </v>

35
00:01:45.821 --> 00:01:46.654
<v Speaker 1>around 20 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is much lower than in other parts </v>

36
00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:51.430
<v Speaker 1>of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is pretty strong evidence about how</v>

37
00:01:51.431 --> 00:01:54.370
<v Speaker 1>artificial and unproductive these </v>
<v Speaker 1>organizations.</v>

38
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.890
<v Speaker 1>We'll see the details of this case </v>
<v Speaker 1>though.</v>

39
00:02:01.891 --> 00:02:05.970
<v Speaker 1>The word disappointment or failure would</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably better describe Mercosur boss.</v>

40
00:02:05.971 --> 00:02:06.804
<v Speaker 1>I can already tell you that it is very </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible that this lack of real </v>

41
00:02:08.791 --> 00:02:09.624
<v Speaker 1>integration is the origin of some of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>most important problems that the region </v>

42
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:17.841
<v Speaker 1>is facing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Turnell promise</v>

43
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.070
<v Speaker 1>in America is to view is it's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic region.</v>

44
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.933
<v Speaker 1>It's got great natural resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has significant biodiversity and its </v>

45
00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:31.350
<v Speaker 1>climate is very unimpressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many people would say that the region is</v>

46
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:32.900
<v Speaker 1>one of the most beautiful on a,</v>

47
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:39.260
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

48
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:40.093
<v Speaker 1>economically speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things on not looking so great despite </v>

49
00:02:42.711 --> 00:02:45.820
<v Speaker 1>all of these magnificent resources and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ditch great potential,</v>

50
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:49.250
<v Speaker 1>the region has been left behind in terms</v>
<v Speaker 1>of economic growth.</v>

51
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.113
<v Speaker 1>Let's compare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example the current Richard's </v>

52
00:02:51.741 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>country in Latin America and that would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be chilly.</v>

53
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.960
<v Speaker 1>So I think most people would agree here </v>
<v Speaker 1>that shit.</v>

54
00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.940
<v Speaker 1>He's done a pretty good job in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>few decades.</v>

55
00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:59.531
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:03.100
<v Speaker 1>despite that apparent progress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have a look at this.</v>

57
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.490
<v Speaker 2>Oh No.</v>

58
00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.323
<v Speaker 1>We have taken the richest country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America and have competitive to </v>

59
00:03:15.641 --> 00:03:18.460
<v Speaker 1>South Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is not even the richest country in</v>

60
00:03:18.461 --> 00:03:20.400
<v Speaker 1>eastern Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ben's weld.</v>

61
00:03:20.401 --> 00:03:23.230
<v Speaker 1>The difference is pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the sixties,</v>

62
00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:26.560
<v Speaker 1>Chile was a poor country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but was far richer than South Korea.</v>

63
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.473
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

64
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.350
<v Speaker 1>well things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're rather different.</v>

65
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.343
<v Speaker 1>Look at Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which was once the richest country in </v>

66
00:03:39.171 --> 00:03:41.240
<v Speaker 1>Latin America with the exception of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Cuba,</v>

67
00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.930
<v Speaker 1>but now we'll take a look at its </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution when compared to Spain.</v>

68
00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:53.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the causes for this lower growth,</v>

69
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:57.530
<v Speaker 1>my precisely be the low trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration and the access protectionism</v>

70
00:03:57.531 --> 00:04:00.650
<v Speaker 1>and bureaucracy that the region has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always suffered from.</v>

71
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:01.573
<v Speaker 1>I mean there are loads of agreements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are tons of committees and forums </v>

72
00:04:04.131 --> 00:04:06.260
<v Speaker 1>and all of that stuff,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the rubber hits the road,</v>

73
00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:07.363
<v Speaker 1>it was really nothing there but do hold </v>
<v Speaker 1>on for just one second because a few </v>

74
00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:12.763
<v Speaker 1>years ago a new integration project it </v>
<v Speaker 1>was put into place and this one is </v>

75
00:04:15.711 --> 00:04:18.680
<v Speaker 1>actually completely different to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest.</v>

76
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.040
<v Speaker 1>Not only is it the first project with </v>
<v Speaker 1>real success in the region,</v>

77
00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.023
<v Speaker 1>but it might also change the destiny of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America forever and here we're </v>

78
00:04:27.231 --> 00:04:32.231
<v Speaker 1>talking about the Pacific alliance civic</v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance,</v>

79
00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.300
<v Speaker 1>April of 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all friends,</v>

80
00:04:41.301 --> 00:04:41.991
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>

81
00:04:41.991 --> 00:04:42.824
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru formed the so called Pacific </v>

82
00:04:44.661 --> 00:04:45.494
<v Speaker 1>alliance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's mission is to finally achieve and </v>

83
00:04:46.911 --> 00:04:50.210
<v Speaker 1>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the goods capital and people can move</v>

84
00:04:50.211 --> 00:04:51.044
<v Speaker 1>freely around the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of this was put in place with the </v>

85
00:04:53.631 --> 00:04:57.590
<v Speaker 1>idea that it would stimulate growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>development and competitiveness in these</v>

86
00:04:57.591 --> 00:04:58.424
<v Speaker 1>economies.</v>

87
00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:59.563
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

88
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:04.010
<v Speaker 1>Teresa account for 55 percent of Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>American exports.</v>

89
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.100
<v Speaker 1>This is not a romantic integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political integration.</v>

90
00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.310
<v Speaker 1>It is a realistic integration before the</v>
<v Speaker 1>world and to the world.</v>

91
00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.400
<v Speaker 1>Alan Garcia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>former president of Peru,</v>

92
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.200
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so they did.</v>

93
00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.860
<v Speaker 1>Even though there's still a lot of work </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be done since then development,</v>

94
00:05:18.861 --> 00:05:23.861
<v Speaker 1>it's been really significant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Six years.</v>

95
00:05:26.451 --> 00:05:27.284
<v Speaker 1>These four countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've removed 92 percent of customs </v>

96
00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:32.990
<v Speaker 1>tariffs and they've set a deadline to </v>
<v Speaker 1>remove all of the rest as well.</v>

97
00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.883
<v Speaker 1>Along with this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've simplified the bureaucracy of </v>

98
00:05:35.301 --> 00:05:36.134
<v Speaker 1>customs and administration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially when it comes to rules about </v>

99
00:05:38.721 --> 00:05:42.860
<v Speaker 1>the origin of goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was previously a significant burden</v>

100
00:05:42.861 --> 00:05:43.694
<v Speaker 1>on the region.</v>

101
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.340
<v Speaker 2>Alright.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

102
00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.173
<v Speaker 1>so up until now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if a Colombian producer used Peruvian </v>

103
00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:50.273
<v Speaker 1>supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he couldn't take advantage of the free </v>

104
00:05:51.861 --> 00:05:56.420
<v Speaker 1>trade agreements between Columbia and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico when selling his goods to Mexico,</v>

105
00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.350
<v Speaker 1>which just crazy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not the end of it.</v>

106
00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Visa requirements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've also been eliminated,</v>

107
00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.430
<v Speaker 1>so the movements of visitors has </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually doubled and then,</v>

108
00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.264
<v Speaker 1>and this is very important,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there have been significant advances in </v>

109
00:06:11.211 --> 00:06:12.044
<v Speaker 1>financial integration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These four countries have created the m </v>

110
00:06:14.881 --> 00:06:17.990
<v Speaker 1>I l a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the American integrated market,</v>

111
00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 1>which is meant to be the largest stock </v>
<v Speaker 1>market in Latin.</v>

112
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.290
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

113
00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:22.123
<v Speaker 2>American</v>

114
00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.150
<v Speaker 1>oldest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more among other initiatives.</v>

115
00:06:27.151 --> 00:06:30.600
<v Speaker 1>The countries in the alliance are </v>
<v Speaker 1>working together in order to be known in</v>

116
00:06:30.601 --> 00:06:31.434
<v Speaker 1>international markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have also started to share </v>

117
00:06:33.481 --> 00:06:34.314
<v Speaker 1>embassies in African and Asian countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they have decided to negotiate </v>

118
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:39.690
<v Speaker 1>altogether for their free trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements.</v>

119
00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.553
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've actually already started to do </v>

120
00:06:41.641 --> 00:06:43.200
<v Speaker 1>this with New Zealand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

121
00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:44.940
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Singapore.</v>

122
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.080
<v Speaker 1>Australia and New Zealand start trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>talks with Pacific alliance.</v>

123
00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:50.003
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these four countries are building step </v>

124
00:06:51.831 --> 00:06:52.664
<v Speaker 1>by step,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a unique market which will be rather </v>

125
00:06:54.871 --> 00:06:55.704
<v Speaker 1>significance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about 240 million </v>

126
00:06:58.171 --> 00:06:59.004
<v Speaker 1>consumers with a combined GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes this alliance one of the </v>

127
00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:04.920
<v Speaker 1>eight largest economies in the world.</v>

128
00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:05.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

129
00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.213
<v Speaker 1>This is an economy that represents 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent of all exports and more than 40 </v>

130
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:15.940
<v Speaker 1>percent of all foreign investments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America.</v>

131
00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:16.863
<v Speaker 1>We could say that if the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance keeps it up in a very short </v>

132
00:07:19.691 --> 00:07:22.120
<v Speaker 1>time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we might have to consider it the biggest</v>

133
00:07:22.121 --> 00:07:22.954
<v Speaker 1>power in Latin America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in order to understand a bit better </v>

134
00:07:25.451 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 1>the achievements that they've had in </v>
<v Speaker 1>only six years,</v>

135
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.833
<v Speaker 1>we should look at the other large group </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the region and that would be fall of </v>

136
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.583
<v Speaker 1>METCO.</v>

137
00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.080
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was created in 1991 by Brazil,</v>

138
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.510
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay,</v>

139
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:47.080
<v Speaker 1>and Paraguay with the intention of </v>
<v Speaker 1>creating one large integrated market.</v>

140
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.030
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these were ambitious goals,</v>

141
00:07:49.031 --> 00:07:52.090
<v Speaker 1>but the advances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've been pretty damn modest.</v>

142
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.980
<v Speaker 1>And how about some evidence of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

143
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:54.873
<v Speaker 1>just have a look at this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The trade among Mercosur members </v>

144
00:07:57.100 --> 00:08:02.100
<v Speaker 1>represents today less than 30 percent of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the total trade of its members in 1995.</v>

145
00:08:02.590 --> 00:08:03.423
<v Speaker 1>That was almost 20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather than encouraging trade between </v>

146
00:08:08.231 --> 00:08:09.064
<v Speaker 1>its members,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that Marcus has actually </v>

147
00:08:11.141 --> 00:08:11.974
<v Speaker 1>weakened them in the last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft has become some sort of </v>

148
00:08:15.311 --> 00:08:16.144
<v Speaker 1>protectionist shield rather than </v>
<v Speaker 1>something which is working to integrate </v>

149
00:08:19.121 --> 00:08:19.954
<v Speaker 1>these countries further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not exactly what they wanted in the </v>

150
00:08:21.941 --> 00:08:22.774
<v Speaker 1>first place.</v>

151
00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:24.730
<v Speaker 2>Group</v>

152
00:08:24.730 --> 00:08:27.440
<v Speaker 1>is become little more than an antigo </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking shop,</v>

153
00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:29.930
<v Speaker 1>but why isn't this working?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

154
00:08:29.960 --> 00:08:32.990
<v Speaker 1>that's mainly because the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're not really very committed.</v>

155
00:08:33.110 --> 00:08:33.943
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft is a process of economic </v>

156
00:08:36.051 --> 00:08:36.884
<v Speaker 1>integration,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there are so many exceptions and </v>

157
00:08:38.721 --> 00:08:40.370
<v Speaker 1>restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's in the end.</v>

158
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:42.920
<v Speaker 1>There's no free movement of goods or </v>
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>

159
00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:46.490
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft has become something which is </v>
<v Speaker 1>totally ineffective.</v>

160
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:50.840
<v Speaker 1>A good example can be found on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border of Argentina and Uruguay.</v>

161
00:08:50.930 --> 00:08:51.763
<v Speaker 1>In theory,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the goods should be able to move freely </v>

162
00:08:53.540 --> 00:08:55.390
<v Speaker 1>between both countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

163
00:08:55.391 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>the reality is of the difference when </v>
<v Speaker 1>adding customs,</v>

164
00:08:58.201 --> 00:09:00.950
<v Speaker 1>inspections and bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A truck from Uruguay,</v>

165
00:09:01.140 --> 00:09:04.530
<v Speaker 1>Argentina could be delayed for more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>24 hours,</v>

166
00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:07.930
<v Speaker 1>which is totally crazy when it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>supposed to not be delayed at all.</v>

167
00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.690
<v Speaker 1>All of this has led to Uruguay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>formally asking,</v>

168
00:09:12.691 --> 00:09:13.524
<v Speaker 1>do you become a member of the Pacific </v>
<v Speaker 1>alliance and there is more to this </v>

169
00:09:16.771 --> 00:09:17.604
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Still the political change in Argentina </v>

170
00:09:18.991 --> 00:09:21.450
<v Speaker 1>and Brazil has led to both of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

171
00:09:21.451 --> 00:09:25.140
<v Speaker 1>Accepting that marcus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least as it is understood today,</v>

172
00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:30.260
<v Speaker 1>is almost completely worthless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll never reach the common market.</v>

173
00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:31.313
<v Speaker 1>The custom union is completely destroyed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the free trade area is not working </v>

174
00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.200
<v Speaker 1>either.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mercosur isn't a dying state.</v>

175
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.230
<v Speaker 1>Danilo is story minister of Economy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay.</v>

176
00:09:40.890 --> 00:09:41.723
<v Speaker 1>This is why Macri has decided to become </v>
<v Speaker 1>closer to the Pacific alliance and look </v>

177
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 1>the ties between both processes of </v>
<v Speaker 1>integration.</v>

178
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.323
<v Speaker 1>The real question becomes now will the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pacific alliance creates a change in </v>

179
00:09:51.271 --> 00:09:52.560
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so if it does,</v>

180
00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>then that would be great news for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire region,</v>

181
00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:00.800
<v Speaker 1>civic pumas.</v>

182
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.280
<v Speaker 1>Now of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the question that we have to ask is,</v>

183
00:10:07.281 --> 00:10:08.114
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is the Pacific alliance on like any </v>

184
00:10:09.501 --> 00:10:10.334
<v Speaker 1>of those other organizations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the only one that seems to be working </v>

185
00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:16.670
<v Speaker 1>well maybe this has to do with these so </v>
<v Speaker 1>called Pacific Pumas,</v>

186
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.630
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peru,</v>

187
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.220
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mexico.</v>

188
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:20.143
<v Speaker 1>These countries have been the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>dynamic economies in Latin America and </v>

189
00:10:23.631 --> 00:10:24.464
<v Speaker 1>they share the same vision.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They all agree there's in order to grow </v>

190
00:10:26.601 --> 00:10:27.434
<v Speaker 1>and develop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have to produce and do business </v>

191
00:10:29.031 --> 00:10:29.864
<v Speaker 1>with the rest of the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is why according to the welds </v>

192
00:10:32.301 --> 00:10:34.790
<v Speaker 1>bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these humans are the country where it is</v>

193
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.653
<v Speaker 1>easiest to do business or were more </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade agreements are signed with the </v>

194
00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:38.850
<v Speaker 1>rest of the week.</v>

195
00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:43.850
<v Speaker 2>Well anyway,</v>

196
00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:52.510
<v Speaker 1>the Pacific Alliance represents one of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the best opportunities for Latin America</v>

197
00:10:52.511 --> 00:10:55.600
<v Speaker 1>to be in a position to become the talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the town.</v>

198
00:10:55.720 --> 00:10:56.553
<v Speaker 1>It wouldn't even be too much of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stretch to say that we could be </v>

199
00:10:58.211 --> 00:11:00.640
<v Speaker 1>witnessing the birth of a great economic</v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

200
00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:04.000
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Latin America has to bet on</v>

201
00:11:04.001 --> 00:11:05.870
<v Speaker 1>these processes of integration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>leave us your opinion in the comments </v>
