1
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:08.490
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>

2
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:12.250
<v Speaker 1>all the fifty cents and Kanye west of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Latin America.</v>

3
00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.080
<v Speaker 1>Now it is true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they share a border,</v>

4
00:00:14.081 --> 00:00:16.540
<v Speaker 1>but other than that they couldn't be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more different.</v>

5
00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:19.390
<v Speaker 1>So Olivia is one of the poorest </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries on the whole continents.</v>

6
00:00:19.391 --> 00:00:20.224
<v Speaker 1>While Chile is among the wealthiest </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia is a paragon of these so called </v>

7
00:00:23.381 --> 00:00:24.214
<v Speaker 1>indigenous socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Chile is known as the mod or of </v>

8
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.800
<v Speaker 1>Neo liberalism,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and as if this was not enough,</v>

9
00:00:29.801 --> 00:00:30.634
<v Speaker 1>the two countries are involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>seemingly never ending territorial </v>

10
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:34.534
<v Speaker 1>disputes with each other nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that is one thing that these two </v>

11
00:00:37.751 --> 00:00:39.880
<v Speaker 1>countries have in common.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

12
00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.090
<v Speaker 1>If you are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we are talking about a white gold.</v>

13
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.300
<v Speaker 2>God Damn.</v>

14
00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:50.950
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

15
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.250
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

16
00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.230
<v Speaker 1>That type of white gold.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking here about lithium.</v>

17
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.040
<v Speaker 1>Lithium is used for the manufacturing of</v>
<v Speaker 1>batteries that power your cell phone,</v>

18
00:00:58.041 --> 00:01:00.350
<v Speaker 1>your laptop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those electric cars.</v>

19
00:01:00.351 --> 00:01:03.260
<v Speaker 1>This eventually you might flood our </v>
<v Speaker 1>roads and highways,</v>

20
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.370
<v Speaker 1>the coat,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new oil.</v>

21
00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.710
<v Speaker 3>If the latest metal on the periodic </v>
<v Speaker 3>table,</v>

22
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.813
<v Speaker 3>it's value has gone up tenfold in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>last two decades alone and it's demand </v>

23
00:01:11.271 --> 00:01:12.104
<v Speaker 3>won't stop growing between 60 and 80 </v>
<v Speaker 3>percent of the world's known reserves </v>

24
00:01:18.651 --> 00:01:21.380
<v Speaker 3>are in an area called the lithium </v>
<v Speaker 3>triangle.</v>

25
00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.690
<v Speaker 3>This is an area that covers parts of </v>
<v Speaker 3>Argentina,</v>

26
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:25.070
<v Speaker 3>Bolivia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and Chile.</v>

27
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:28.370
<v Speaker 3>In these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 3>lithium is abundant and easy to extract.</v>

28
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.263
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 3>this part of the planet might soon </v>

29
00:01:30.981 --> 00:01:32.360
<v Speaker 3>become a new Saudi Arabia</v>

30
00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:33.573
<v Speaker 1>forum that it's found in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is found in these dried up salt lake's </v>

31
00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.100
<v Speaker 1>solars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so Brian's,</v>

32
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.010
<v Speaker 1>which is very different than getting </v>
<v Speaker 1>lithium out of hard rock.</v>

33
00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.873
<v Speaker 1>It's a much cheaper,</v>
<v Speaker 1>much more effective among those three </v>

34
00:01:44.861 --> 00:01:47.290
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia is the luckiest one.</v>

35
00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.333
<v Speaker 1>The so called salons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A Uni holds two or three times more </v>

36
00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.470
<v Speaker 1>lithium reserves than the mines in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina or in Chile.</v>

37
00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.261
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>

38
00:01:54.261 --> 00:01:57.340
<v Speaker 1>the Chili already has a world class </v>
<v Speaker 1>mining industry.</v>

39
00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.810
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite these reserves,</v>

40
00:01:58.811 --> 00:02:02.080
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia is exporting less lithium than </v>
<v Speaker 1>the other two countries,</v>

41
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.620
<v Speaker 1>and shelley might actually soon be out </v>
<v Speaker 1>of this new white gold rush.</v>

42
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:06.543
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is the nation that is getting </v>

43
00:02:07.781 --> 00:02:10.090
<v Speaker 1>the most attention from international </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>

44
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.900
<v Speaker 1>so today's question has to be what's </v>
<v Speaker 1>going on in Bolivia?</v>

45
00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.823
<v Speaker 1>Why is no one exploiting?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then lithium resources and why is Chili </v>

46
00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.843
<v Speaker 1>following six today?</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're going to answer all of those </v>

47
00:02:20.801 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

48
00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.420
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the history</v>

49
00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.290
<v Speaker 3>new Potosi.</v>

50
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.253
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you've been subscribed to visual </v>

51
00:02:28.981 --> 00:02:29.814
<v Speaker 1>policy for a while,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know that having natural </v>

52
00:02:31.351 --> 00:02:33.690
<v Speaker 1>resources doesn't mean that you are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rich,</v>

53
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.640
<v Speaker 1>but if he is an excellent example of</v>

54
00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.460
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

55
00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.913
<v Speaker 1>the country has all the natural wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine lithium Silva natural </v>

56
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:45.570
<v Speaker 1>gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

57
00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.280
<v Speaker 1>it is still one of the poorest countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>in all of South America.</v>

58
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.223
<v Speaker 3>The silver mines of Potosi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>where the state of war for the Spanish </v>

59
00:02:52.901 --> 00:02:55.150
<v Speaker 3>crown during the 16th and 17th centuries</v>

60
00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.780
<v Speaker 2>backed</v>

61
00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 3>Spaniard still say</v>

62
00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 1>this is worth a potosi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meaning that something is too expensive,</v>

63
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:04.263
<v Speaker 1>but the native Bolivians didn't reap the</v>
<v Speaker 1>benefits of that silver wealth and </v>

64
00:03:07.301 --> 00:03:10.750
<v Speaker 1>millions died under the stream working </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions in the mines.</v>

65
00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.260
<v Speaker 1>This is why it's pretty understandable </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the governments of Evo Morales says</v>

66
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.173
<v Speaker 1>is so reluctant to allow foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies to get into the country and </v>

67
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:18.690
<v Speaker 1>extract the liquid.</v>

68
00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:19.573
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

69
00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.800
<v Speaker 1>let's Let.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's be honest,</v>

70
00:03:23.801 --> 00:03:26.320
<v Speaker 1>the real business here is not the raw </v>
<v Speaker 1>materials,</v>

71
00:03:26.321 --> 00:03:29.860
<v Speaker 1>Bart in the industry that comes </v>
<v Speaker 1>afterwards for a better understanding of</v>

72
00:03:29.861 --> 00:03:30.694
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why don't we make this video a metric </v>

73
00:03:31.601 --> 00:03:35.620
<v Speaker 1>ton of lithium costs around $9,000 on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the international market,</v>

74
00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:36.663
<v Speaker 1>but if we take that raw lithium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then we turn it into batteries for </v>

75
00:03:39.011 --> 00:03:42.100
<v Speaker 1>mobile phones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can turn that lithium into a value of</v>

76
00:03:42.101 --> 00:03:45.850
<v Speaker 1>somewhere between one point five and </v>
<v Speaker 1>$5,000,000.</v>

77
00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:46.713
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is just a rough estimate of value </v>

78
00:03:47.891 --> 00:03:50.180
<v Speaker 1>and there are lots of things that should</v>
<v Speaker 1>be considered here,</v>

79
00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.123
<v Speaker 1>but it can help to look into comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indeed it can help explain it and use </v>

80
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:55.143
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

81
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.993
<v Speaker 3>Plus he take Abel Morales Morales opened</v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2013 the first plant of lithium </v>

82
00:04:01.111 --> 00:04:06.111
<v Speaker 3>carbonate and in February 2014 limit the</v>
<v Speaker 3>first manufacturing facility for lithium</v>

83
00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:07.860
<v Speaker 3>ion batteries,</v>

84
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:11.560
<v Speaker 1>but that is not all in Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lithium is nationalized.</v>

85
00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.423
<v Speaker 1>This means that if you are a private </v>
<v Speaker 1>mining company and you want to work on </v>

86
00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.350
<v Speaker 1>Canadian soil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you must partner with the government and</v>

87
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:20.830
<v Speaker 1>start a new company which will be owned </v>
<v Speaker 1>partly by the governments.</v>

88
00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.830
<v Speaker 1>This new company can get paid for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>service and building the mind,</v>

89
00:04:23.831 --> 00:04:26.410
<v Speaker 1>setting up the machinery and extracting </v>
<v Speaker 1>the lithium.</v>

90
00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.843
<v Speaker 1>The lithium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they extract well that belongs to the </v>

91
00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:31.990
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no rights to it.</v>

92
00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.383
<v Speaker 1>What do you wondering?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why does Bolivia need foreign companies </v>

93
00:04:38.341 --> 00:04:42.120
<v Speaker 1>to exploit that wealth?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They simply do it themselves.</v>

94
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.740
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the short answer is no.</v>

95
00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.833
<v Speaker 1>Modern Day mining,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has nothing to do with the image you </v>

96
00:04:47.641 --> 00:04:50.760
<v Speaker 1>probably have in your mind's going with </v>
<v Speaker 1>a hardhat on they pick axe.</v>

97
00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:51.743
<v Speaker 1>Today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mining requires high ends machinery and </v>

98
00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.770
<v Speaker 1>world class engineers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

99
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.290
<v Speaker 1>these things are scarce in a country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor,</v>

100
00:04:58.291 --> 00:04:58.820
<v Speaker 1>has been,</v>

101
00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.653
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

102
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:06.120
<v Speaker 1>Create a competitive mining industry in </v>
<v Speaker 1>that country without outside help.</v>

103
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.013
<v Speaker 1>You would need decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why it is so important to </v>

104
00:05:10.351 --> 00:05:12.720
<v Speaker 1>utilize companies who have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology,</v>

105
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.060
<v Speaker 1>the tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the staff to do the job.</v>

106
00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:15.953
<v Speaker 1>And this is why even Moralez himself </v>
<v Speaker 1>friendly to multinationals have said </v>

107
00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:22.590
<v Speaker 1>that it's time to get out there and find</v>
<v Speaker 1>investors,</v>

108
00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:26.010
<v Speaker 3>elemental getting used.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We have a big lithium industry,</v>

109
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:26.933
<v Speaker 3>Bolivia.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We'll set the lithium price for the </v>

110
00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.260
<v Speaker 3>whole world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>I want you to say to you governments and</v>

111
00:05:33.391 --> 00:05:35.880
<v Speaker 3>private companies now you can join us.</v>

112
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:42.790
<v Speaker 2>So.</v>

113
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.530
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so what exactly is the problem here?</v>

114
00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:45.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said before,</v>

115
00:05:45.461 --> 00:05:46.294
<v Speaker 1>Bolivian lithium is owned by the state.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that companies that might </v>

116
00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.223
<v Speaker 1>invest in the country can only get to </v>
<v Speaker 1>profit by partnering with the </v>

117
00:05:52.361 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 1>governments and from that profit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a famous pay,</v>

118
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.880
<v Speaker 1>a special mining tax that goes up to 37 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point five percent,</v>

119
00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:01.730
<v Speaker 1>which is by far the largest in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

120
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.230
<v Speaker 1>And if all of this wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

121
00:06:03.231 --> 00:06:04.064
<v Speaker 1>according to the world's bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia ranks among the 50 countries </v>

122
00:06:06.321 --> 00:06:07.154
<v Speaker 1>where it is hardest to do business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they rank at about the same level as </v>

123
00:06:10.371 --> 00:06:13.310
<v Speaker 1>Sierra Leone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's say that you're someone who</v>

124
00:06:13.311 --> 00:06:14.144
<v Speaker 1>wants to invest in lithium.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you fancy investing in Bolivia or </v>

125
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:19.700
<v Speaker 1>maybe you might prefer one of those </v>
<v Speaker 1>other countries.</v>

126
00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:20.683
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe this explains why the moments </v>

127
00:06:23.390 --> 00:06:26.840
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia Wallace is the country with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>biggest lithium resources.</v>

128
00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:29.060
<v Speaker 1>It is also the country that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>exploiting them.</v>

129
00:06:29.061 --> 00:06:31.250
<v Speaker 1>The least.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pay attention to the chart,</v>

130
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:32.563
<v Speaker 1>you will see that today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader of the lithium race is </v>

131
00:06:35.361 --> 00:06:40.361
<v Speaker 1>awesome,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising because the resources of this</v>

132
00:06:41.761 --> 00:06:45.180
<v Speaker 1>country off four times smaller than </v>
<v Speaker 1>those of Bolivia Fonts,</v>

133
00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:48.600
<v Speaker 1>Australian salaries are six times higher</v>
<v Speaker 1>than Bolivian ones.</v>

134
00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.613
<v Speaker 1>So as you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not a matter of low pay jobs on </v>

135
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:53.263
<v Speaker 1>natural wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but simply good and bad economic </v>

136
00:06:56.101 --> 00:06:56.934
<v Speaker 1>policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But hold on just a minute because this </v>

137
00:06:58.771 --> 00:06:59.604
<v Speaker 1>is not the only problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget that Evo Morales dream is </v>

138
00:07:02.431 --> 00:07:07.110
<v Speaker 1>for Bolivia to become a manufacturing </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader in the lithium battery industry.</v>

139
00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.203
<v Speaker 1>But I mean how exactly is he going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieve this without foreign companies </v>

140
00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:12.560
<v Speaker 1>setting up insight.</v>

141
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:17.980
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so yeah,</v>

142
00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:18.823
<v Speaker 1>the government can set up its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory and that's all great and </v>

143
00:07:21.171 --> 00:07:22.004
<v Speaker 1>everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but technology patents and the skills </v>

144
00:07:23.721 --> 00:07:26.210
<v Speaker 1>needed that held by companies like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Panasonic.</v>

145
00:07:26.211 --> 00:07:28.970
<v Speaker 1>Samsung will tesla without these </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia,</v>

146
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.833
<v Speaker 1>would need decades of research in order </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be competitive on the international </v>

147
00:07:33.531 --> 00:07:34.364
<v Speaker 1>markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>

148
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:35.263
<v Speaker 1>so a while ago we mentioned Chili.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now let's go over and have a look at </v>

149
00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:38.600
<v Speaker 1>what's happening over there.</v>

150
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:45.650
<v Speaker 3>Chalet follows in the steps of Bolivia.</v>

151
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:46.593
<v Speaker 1>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jenny has been known as something of a </v>

152
00:07:48.371 --> 00:07:49.204
<v Speaker 1>free market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disneyland or precisely they're mining </v>

153
00:07:51.581 --> 00:07:54.460
<v Speaker 1>industry was one of the freest in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>

154
00:07:54.670 --> 00:07:55.503
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether your comedy relies heavily on </v>

155
00:07:57.791 --> 00:07:59.140
<v Speaker 1>copper mining.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why you have,</v>

156
00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:03.550
<v Speaker 1>again 1981 Pinochet's dictatorship past </v>
<v Speaker 1>these so called mining law.</v>

157
00:08:06.410 --> 00:08:09.710
<v Speaker 1>This allowed private businesses to own </v>
<v Speaker 1>100 percent.</v>

158
00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:11.313
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this little kickstarted foreign </v>

159
00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:13.544
<v Speaker 1>investments in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly lots of companies like the </v>

160
00:08:15.831 --> 00:08:20.030
<v Speaker 1>Australian Bhp Billiton or the Swiss </v>
<v Speaker 1>xstrata came to Chile.</v>

161
00:08:20.590 --> 00:08:21.141
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

162
00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:21.974
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All these multinational companies while </v>

163
00:08:23.661 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 1>they looted to the country and left it </v>
<v Speaker 1>in poverty,</v>

164
00:08:25.690 --> 00:08:26.660
<v Speaker 1>rice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

165
00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:28.550
<v Speaker 1>Well actually that's</v>

166
00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:30.410
<v Speaker 3>really wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Of course these Canadian,</v>

167
00:08:30.411 --> 00:08:33.330
<v Speaker 3>Swiss and Australian companies came to </v>
<v Speaker 3>extract the cop,</v>

168
00:08:33.400 --> 00:08:34.233
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

169
00:08:37.430 --> 00:08:38.263
<v Speaker 3>Also helped to finance lots of brand new</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies which employ Chilean workers </v>

170
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:42.644
<v Speaker 3>and we're headquartered in Santiago,</v>
<v Speaker 3>companies like Manera Escondida or </v>

171
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:47.120
<v Speaker 3>Antofagasta mining.</v>

172
00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:49.280
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this wave of investors,</v>

173
00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.100
<v Speaker 1>Chili now has any world class mining </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry,</v>

174
00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.740
<v Speaker 1>actually many of the engineers that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>now needed in Bolivia,</v>

175
00:08:55.770 --> 00:08:56.603
<v Speaker 1>they live in the best neighborhoods of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Santiago and this means that one has </v>

176
00:09:00.241 --> 00:09:03.100
<v Speaker 1>been in a great position to lead this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point.</v>

177
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:04.770
<v Speaker 1>Gold Rush.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

178
00:09:04.771 --> 00:09:05.604
<v Speaker 1>in 2016 Chilean presidents,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Michelle Backlash declared that the </v>

179
00:09:08.550 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 1>lithium was a different animal</v>

180
00:09:13.700 --> 00:09:14.533
<v Speaker 1>from the strategic condition of lithium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is property of all Chilean people </v>

181
00:09:18.231 --> 00:09:21.950
<v Speaker 1>and we'll keep it state as </v>
<v Speaker 1>nonconcessional material.</v>

182
00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.873
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the governments of Chiney is following </v>

183
00:09:24.171 --> 00:09:25.004
<v Speaker 1>suit with Bolivia barter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They do have an important difference in </v>

184
00:09:27.951 --> 00:09:28.784
<v Speaker 1>this case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country already has the technology </v>

185
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:34.310
<v Speaker 1>and the staff to exploit its mineral </v>
<v Speaker 1>wealth in an efficient way.</v>

186
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.950
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of these companies who were willing</v>

187
00:09:36.951 --> 00:09:39.290
<v Speaker 1>to invest in the country have lost all </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest,</v>

188
00:09:39.380 --> 00:09:40.213
<v Speaker 1>but surely has its own companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's not so big a deal besides until </v>

189
00:09:43.521 --> 00:09:44.354
<v Speaker 1>2014.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The other countries have this lithium </v>

190
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:47.570
<v Speaker 1>triangle in Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Bolivia,</v>

191
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:48.553
<v Speaker 1>well way worse places for investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in this case is sort of like in the </v>

192
00:09:54.921 --> 00:09:57.260
<v Speaker 1>land of the blind,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one eyed passing is king.</v>

193
00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.213
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they entail now Argentina has been the </v>

194
00:10:00.801 --> 00:10:01.634
<v Speaker 1>big surprise here while Chile and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia have nationalized the lithium </v>

195
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:07.340
<v Speaker 1>and have tried badly to scare away </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign companies.</v>

196
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.233
<v Speaker 1>Argentina with Mauricio Macri as its </v>
<v Speaker 1>president is doing something rather </v>

197
00:10:11.841 --> 00:10:15.230
<v Speaker 1>different and the now getting all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention from international</v>

198
00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:16.213
<v Speaker 2>investors.</v>

199
00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:20.033
<v Speaker 1>We're actually going to talk about that </v>
<v Speaker 1>in upcoming weeks in a sort of second </v>

200
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:24.900
<v Speaker 1>part to this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if you don't want to miss that,</v>

<v Speaker 1>we've got a question for you.</v>

203
00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.073
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Bolivia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile can reap the benefits of their </v>

204
00:10:33.481 --> 00:10:34.314
<v Speaker 1>lithium with these kinds of policies or </v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe Argentina will somehow overshadow </v>

205
00:10:37.881 --> 00:10:38.714
<v Speaker 1>them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can leave me in the comment section </v>
