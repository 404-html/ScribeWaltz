1
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.913
<v Speaker 1>Showing you that is already a giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This country is the largest trading </v>

2
00:00:11.511 --> 00:00:12.560
<v Speaker 1>power in the world,</v>

3
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.340
<v Speaker 1>the wells with hundreds of products and </v>
<v Speaker 1>have one of the largest foreign currency</v>

4
00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:23.580
<v Speaker 1>reserves in the entire planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't see even the petro monarchies in</v>

5
00:00:23.581 --> 00:00:27.000
<v Speaker 1>the Persian Gulf can compete with this </v>
<v Speaker 1>giant country.</v>

6
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.070
<v Speaker 1>Ends with all of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It isn't surprising defined.</v>

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.920
<v Speaker 1>Some analysts see states that China will</v>
<v Speaker 1>surpass.</v>

8
00:00:31.921 --> 00:00:32.754
<v Speaker 1>The United States is the leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic power and they're going to do </v>

9
00:00:35.881 --> 00:00:37.470
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We have a lot more inhabitants.</v>

10
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.350
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we usually forget a very important thing</v>

11
00:00:40.351 --> 00:00:41.940
<v Speaker 1>and this is the GDP.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:44.040
<v Speaker 1>it's not everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Economic power.</v>

13
00:00:44.041 --> 00:00:44.874
<v Speaker 1>The real power is closely related to </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporate power and when it comes to </v>

14
00:00:48.181 --> 00:00:49.014
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is still a long way from reaching </v>

15
00:00:51.061 --> 00:00:51.894
<v Speaker 1>the levels of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we look at the top 100 largest </v>

16
00:00:53.911 --> 00:00:58.050
<v Speaker 1>companies in the world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>56 of them are Americans and only 11 are</v>

17
00:00:58.051 --> 00:00:58.884
<v Speaker 1>Chinese,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is something to really bear in </v>

18
00:01:00.331 --> 00:01:01.164
<v Speaker 1>mind because multinationals in </v>
<v Speaker 1>controlled of foreign investments ends </v>

19
00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:07.170
<v Speaker 1>of 80 percent of the world's exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the big question is,</v>

20
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.290
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen to these Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies in the future?</v>

21
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.590
<v Speaker 1>How are things changing and what can we </v>
<v Speaker 1>really expect?</v>

22
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:14.453
<v Speaker 1>These are some of the questions that </v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to be answering in today's </v>

23
00:01:16.921 --> 00:01:17.754
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

24
00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.860
<v Speaker 1>Chinese giant development,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese economy,</v>

25
00:01:24.861 --> 00:01:25.694
<v Speaker 1>as had unimpressive growth rates in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last three decades and key to this was </v>

26
00:01:29.091 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>the concept of them being the welds </v>
<v Speaker 1>factory.</v>

27
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:32.743
<v Speaker 1>This is what China is known for.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are known as a country that has </v>

28
00:01:35.481 --> 00:01:36.314
<v Speaker 1>become a world power and has lifted </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of people from </v>

29
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.770
<v Speaker 1>poverty with a relatively simple </v>
<v Speaker 1>premise,</v>

30
00:01:42.771 --> 00:01:46.130
<v Speaker 1>producing everything and producing it at</v>
<v Speaker 1>a low cost.</v>

31
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.091
<v Speaker 1>Toys,</v>
<v Speaker 1>electronics,</v>

32
00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:50.110
<v Speaker 1>tools,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothing.</v>

33
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.973
<v Speaker 1>When you enter a store,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you aren't going to find hundreds of </v>

34
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>products with something in common and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's that.</v>

35
00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.010
<v Speaker 1>They are all manufactured in massive </v>
<v Speaker 1>industrial areas located all over China.</v>

36
00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:05.950
<v Speaker 1>The in order for a country to really be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the leading economic power,</v>

37
00:02:05.951 --> 00:02:10.630
<v Speaker 1>these companies need to start producing </v>
<v Speaker 1>much more complex products.</v>

38
00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:11.493
<v Speaker 1>Mans they will have to stop competing on</v>
<v Speaker 1>cost and start looking at far higher </v>

39
00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.633
<v Speaker 1>added value.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can include the production of </v>

40
00:02:17.141 --> 00:02:19.390
<v Speaker 1>things like capital assets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>planes,</v>

41
00:02:19.391 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>medical devices,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and computer processes.</v>

42
00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.163
<v Speaker 1>That driverless car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have seen it all entails driving the </v>

43
00:02:26.651 --> 00:02:28.990
<v Speaker 1>future traffic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>light street lamps,</v>

44
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:30.093
<v Speaker 1>business runs on the cloud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the cloud runs on Intel and today </v>

45
00:02:37.931 --> 00:02:38.764
<v Speaker 1>all these sectors are dominated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>large multinational companies of the </v>

46
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.570
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>South Korea,</v>

47
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.130
<v Speaker 1>Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Japan.</v>

48
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.440
<v Speaker 1>It is true that many leading products </v>
<v Speaker 1>are manufactured in China,</v>

49
00:02:53.441 --> 00:02:54.760
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the iphone,</v>

50
00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:55.594
<v Speaker 1>but this is not exactly true because </v>
<v Speaker 1>what China actually is more like the </v>

51
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:03.010
<v Speaker 1>assembly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What this means is that the more complex</v>

52
00:03:03.011 --> 00:03:03.844
<v Speaker 1>parts they're bought from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries and then they simply put </v>

53
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>together in China to better illustrate </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

54
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.280
<v Speaker 1>consider this.</v>

55
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.180
<v Speaker 2>Each year trying to import more than </v>
<v Speaker 2>$200,000,000,000</v>

56
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.140
<v Speaker 2>in semiconductors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which are essential in the manufacturing</v>

57
00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:16.400
<v Speaker 2>of mobile devices.</v>

58
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.343
<v Speaker 1>Just for comparison.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is more money than what the entire </v>

59
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:21.920
<v Speaker 1>country spends on petrol.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

60
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.790
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies have made many </v>
<v Speaker 1>advances</v>

61
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:27.213
<v Speaker 2>today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A fourth of all exports are capital </v>

62
00:03:29.111 --> 00:03:33.100
<v Speaker 2>goods such as machines for example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or high tech products.</v>

63
00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:38.580
<v Speaker 1>In some sectors like telecommunications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wind turbines or high speed trains.</v>

64
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the world leaders,</v>

65
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.203
<v Speaker 1>just that because Chinese companies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>also learning how to make it in the </v>

66
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.750
<v Speaker 1>international market.</v>

67
00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:50.603
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

68
00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.620
<v Speaker 2>great.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese conquest.</v>

69
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.553
<v Speaker 1>Two Thousand and 16 was the 40th </v>
<v Speaker 1>anniversary of the ends of the cultural </v>

70
00:04:00.681 --> 00:04:01.514
<v Speaker 1>revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a telephone campaign which now </v>

71
00:04:03.591 --> 00:04:04.424
<v Speaker 1>organized in order to purify the </v>
<v Speaker 1>revolution and finish off all remnants </v>

72
00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:11.330
<v Speaker 1>of capitalism in Chinese society.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

73
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:12.193
<v Speaker 1>things have changed a lot so much that </v>
<v Speaker 1>China is only behind the United States </v>

74
00:04:16.701 --> 00:04:19.640
<v Speaker 1>in terms of numbers of multinational </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>

75
00:04:19.641 --> 00:04:20.474
<v Speaker 1>companies in this country that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>starting to make it into global markets </v>

76
00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:25.010
<v Speaker 1>as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're doing it really,</v>

77
00:04:25.011 --> 00:04:25.844
<v Speaker 1>really well.</v>

78
00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.630
<v Speaker 2>20 16 Chinese companies spent an </v>
<v Speaker 2>incredible amount of money,</v>

79
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:31.523
<v Speaker 2>$225,</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion dollars in the purchase of </v>

80
00:04:33.511 --> 00:04:36.450
<v Speaker 2>foreign companies in Europe and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>United States alone.</v>

81
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:39.570
<v Speaker 2>They acquired more than 450 company.</v>

82
00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:45.620
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies are buying all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>of businesses,</v>

83
00:04:45.621 --> 00:04:47.000
<v Speaker 1>mining companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>banks,</v>

84
00:04:47.001 --> 00:04:49.010
<v Speaker 1>oil companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pharmaceutical companies,</v>

85
00:04:49.011 --> 00:04:52.340
<v Speaker 1>agricultural companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even luxury hotel chains,</v>

86
00:04:52.341 --> 00:04:54.500
<v Speaker 1>jewelry companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and football clubs.</v>

87
00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.041
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

88
00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:55.874
<v Speaker 1>That right to view of the Chinese have </v>
<v Speaker 1>even bought into Milan and that is just </v>

89
00:04:59.571 --> 00:05:00.500
<v Speaker 1>one example.</v>

90
00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:05.280
<v Speaker 2>Just your city gets a $400,</v>
<v Speaker 2>million dollar Chinese investment deal,</v>

91
00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.520
<v Speaker 1>but if there is one thing in particular </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the Chinese love to invest in,</v>

92
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:11.980
<v Speaker 1>well that would be developing country</v>

93
00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:15.123
<v Speaker 2>Australia and the United States are the </v>
<v Speaker 2>two countries that receive the most in </v>

94
00:05:18.491 --> 00:05:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Chinese investment dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than half of all Chinese investment</v>

95
00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.030
<v Speaker 2>is made in emerging countries located in</v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia,</v>

96
00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:26.740
<v Speaker 2>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Latin America,</v>

97
00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.663
<v Speaker 2>and the Middle East.</v>

98
00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.270
<v Speaker 1>Almost save at the more risky the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

99
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the more willing the Chinese art to </v>
<v Speaker 1>invest in it.</v>

100
00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.980
<v Speaker 1>Know this might surprise you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this,</v>

101
00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:37.823
<v Speaker 1>this is not the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies are also starting to </v>

102
00:05:40.601 --> 00:05:42.420
<v Speaker 1>compete hard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

103
00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:43.323
<v Speaker 1>if there was only one Chinese company </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the top 100 most valuable companies </v>

104
00:05:46.031 --> 00:05:48.940
<v Speaker 1>in 2006,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was 14 by the year,</v>

105
00:05:48.941 --> 00:05:49.774
<v Speaker 1>2015.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And take a look at the smart phone </v>

106
00:05:51.581 --> 00:05:52.410
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

107
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:56.570
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 3>up</v>

108
00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:58.310
<v Speaker 1>until having a Chinese</v>

109
00:05:58.310 --> 00:05:59.000
<v Speaker 3>phone.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

110
00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.710
<v Speaker 3>it was a bit weird,</v>
<v Speaker 3>right?</v>

111
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.710
<v Speaker 3>Well today the four main Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 3>manufacturer is Apo.</v>

112
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.770
<v Speaker 3>Huawei,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Vivo in Chalmette ons,</v>

113
00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.613
<v Speaker 3>just more famous than they were a few </v>
<v Speaker 3>years ago because they also take more </v>

114
00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:10.453
<v Speaker 3>than 10 percent of the welds profits in </v>
<v Speaker 3>this industry and this is a figure that </v>

115
00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:18.140
<v Speaker 3>is growing more and more every single </v>
<v Speaker 3>year and if you want another example,</v>

116
00:06:18.141 --> 00:06:21.590
<v Speaker 3>whether you just have to look to Lenovo,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is a Chinese multinational company</v>

117
00:06:21.591 --> 00:06:22.424
<v Speaker 3>that was born just a few years ago and </v>
<v Speaker 3>indeed it bought the laptop division of </v>

118
00:06:25.431 --> 00:06:30.431
<v Speaker 3>IBM and is now the largest computer </v>
<v Speaker 3>company in the world as they even supply</v>

119
00:06:30.621 --> 00:06:34.940
<v Speaker 3>equipment to the Pentagon and how about </v>
<v Speaker 3>even more examples this hire the biggest</v>

120
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:35.774
<v Speaker 3>manufacturer of household appliances or </v>
<v Speaker 3>go a company that's acquiring land all </v>

121
00:06:38.811 --> 00:06:41.480
<v Speaker 3>over the world like sugarcane </v>
<v Speaker 3>plantations in Australia,</v>

122
00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:45.740
<v Speaker 3>French vineyards or soy plantations in </v>
<v Speaker 3>Brazil and then this Guidea Cola company</v>

123
00:06:45.741 --> 00:06:50.210
<v Speaker 3>which you might not have heard of,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it actually bought out Volvo in 2010</v>

124
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:51.433
<v Speaker 3>Volvo.</v>
<v Speaker 3>That legendary Swedish car company is </v>

125
00:06:53.331 --> 00:06:55.660
<v Speaker 3>now property of a Chinese company.</v>

126
00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:03.660
<v Speaker 1>That is a sector where China is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting ahead.</v>

127
00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.420
<v Speaker 1>It is against all the odds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>

128
00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:09.060
<v Speaker 1>and I say against all odds here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>as you probably know,</v>

129
00:07:09.061 --> 00:07:09.894
<v Speaker 1>China is subject to complete control of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its Internet by the Chinese government </v>

130
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:16.710
<v Speaker 1>with something known as the great </v>
<v Speaker 1>firewall.</v>

131
00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.633
<v Speaker 1>This blocks access to you facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Google ends the economist to name just </v>

132
00:07:20.821 --> 00:07:21.481
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

133
00:07:21.481 --> 00:07:22.620
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>

134
00:07:22.621 --> 00:07:25.350
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty normal to do everything via </v>
<v Speaker 1>apps.</v>

135
00:07:25.351 --> 00:07:27.000
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you visit China,</v>

136
00:07:27.001 --> 00:07:27.834
<v Speaker 1>you rarely pay with credit cards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most common thing is to pay with a </v>

137
00:07:30.151 --> 00:07:34.410
<v Speaker 1>mobile phone using the APP we chat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something of a super app that is</v>

138
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:37.620
<v Speaker 1>like an all in one facebook page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>twitter,</v>

139
00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:38.473
<v Speaker 1>etc.</v>

140
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.050
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we chat is also owned by ten cent,</v>

141
00:07:43.170 --> 00:07:45.810
<v Speaker 2>one of the top 15 most valuable </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies in the world,</v>

142
00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:46.673
<v Speaker 2>which is also the world's largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>supplier of online games and one of the </v>

143
00:07:49.801 --> 00:07:51.390
<v Speaker 2>largest shareholders of tests</v>

144
00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:56.430
<v Speaker 1>by now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You proBably realizing that,</v>

145
00:07:56.431 --> 00:07:58.350
<v Speaker 1>oh yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the chinese,</v>

146
00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.890
<v Speaker 1>they are everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 1>as for another example of their success,</v>

147
00:08:01.891 --> 00:08:06.891
<v Speaker 1>do consider ali baba or an ecommerce </v>
<v Speaker 1>company that brings in $450,000,000,000</v>

148
00:08:08.070 --> 00:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>every year and in China relaying this </v>
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>

149
00:08:11.071 --> 00:08:16.071
<v Speaker 1>it has $400,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million clients and dwelled,</v>

150
00:08:16.380 --> 00:08:17.213
<v Speaker 1>as napoleon said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's try and asleep for when she wakes </v>

151
00:08:19.731 --> 00:08:21.550
<v Speaker 1>up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she will shake the wells,</v>

152
00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:24.310
<v Speaker 1>but before we all getting at sketch,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just have a think about what it means.</v>

153
00:08:24.311 --> 00:08:26.590
<v Speaker 1>It means more competition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means better prices,</v>

154
00:08:26.591 --> 00:08:29.860
<v Speaker 1>better products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and faster technological developments.</v>

155
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:30.753
<v Speaker 1>As consumers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can benefit a great deal from this </v>

156
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:33.814
<v Speaker 1>transition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously it does have plenty of </v>

157
00:08:35.171 --> 00:08:37.990
<v Speaker 1>risks to,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or at least this is what us intelligence</v>

158
00:08:37.991 --> 00:08:39.500
<v Speaker 1>agencies all warning,</v>

159
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.483
<v Speaker 2>according to the house,</v>
<v Speaker 2>permanent select committee on </v>

160
00:08:43.321 --> 00:08:44.154
<v Speaker 2>intelligence is report.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese companies cannot be trusted to </v>

161
00:08:47.371 --> 00:08:48.204
<v Speaker 2>be free of foreign state influence and </v>
<v Speaker 2>thus posted security threat to the </v>

162
00:08:51.961 --> 00:08:53.610
<v Speaker 2>United States and to our system,</v>

163
00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:54.703
<v Speaker 1>and then there's the risk are companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>which are going to have more and more </v>

164
00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.500
<v Speaker 1>competition all day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're also going to have more and more</v>

165
00:08:58.501 --> 00:09:01.590
<v Speaker 1>opportunities to which we previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>discussed in the video.</v>

166
00:09:01.591 --> 00:09:02.424
<v Speaker 1>That will link to you on the screen now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's not get too ahead of </v>

167
00:09:05.191 --> 00:09:06.024
<v Speaker 1>ourselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies all still far behind </v>

168
00:09:08.071 --> 00:09:13.071
<v Speaker 1>in technological terms as they are in </v>
<v Speaker 1>debt and well a great deal of it.</v>

169
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.910
<v Speaker 2>Chinese corporate debt levels are too </v>
<v Speaker 2>high,</v>

170
00:09:17.911 --> 00:09:21.510
<v Speaker 2>but it will take time to bring them down</v>
<v Speaker 2>to more manageable level.</v>

171
00:09:22.990 --> 00:09:24.580
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is not the end of this.</v>

172
00:09:24.610 --> 00:09:25.443
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget that China is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship and this means that the </v>

173
00:09:27.971 --> 00:09:31.240
<v Speaker 1>government tends to much power when it </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes to corporate decisions.</v>

174
00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.790
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government's is pretty arbitrary and</v>

175
00:09:33.791 --> 00:09:35.290
<v Speaker 1>it's really unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

176
00:09:35.291 --> 00:09:36.124
<v Speaker 1>a few years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government encouraged chinese </v>

177
00:09:37.751 --> 00:09:41.560
<v Speaker 1>companies do try the international </v>
<v Speaker 1>markets and they would loan them as much</v>

178
00:09:41.561 --> 00:09:42.394
<v Speaker 1>money as they needed to do so.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now they've decided they want to do the </v>

179
00:09:44.951 --> 00:09:45.784
<v Speaker 1>opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a chinese company that wants to buy </v>

180
00:09:47.111 --> 00:09:47.944
<v Speaker 1>out a foreign company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the need the approval of the chinese </v>

181
00:09:50.651 --> 00:09:54.760
<v Speaker 1>communist party and there are new tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>limitations on money leaving the country</v>

182
00:09:54.790 --> 00:09:56.710
<v Speaker 1>further to that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to mention the censorship,</v>

183
00:09:56.711 --> 00:09:57.544
<v Speaker 1>the legal uncertainty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade obstacles and the bad reputation </v>

184
00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:02.800
<v Speaker 1>of chinese products and so on and so </v>
<v Speaker 1>forth.</v>

185
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:05.620
<v Speaker 1>So we can say that right now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

186
00:10:05.621 --> 00:10:06.454
<v Speaker 1>his position as leader is not in </v>
<v Speaker 1>particular danger unless something </v>

187
00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:12.790
<v Speaker 1>changes that is more dramatic than we </v>
<v Speaker 1>are currently seeing.</v>

188
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.530
<v Speaker 1>Long term though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:17.080
<v Speaker 1>who knows?</v>
