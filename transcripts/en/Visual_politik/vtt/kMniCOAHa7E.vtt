00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.410
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is an interesting case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Busy at the end of the 19th century.</v>

2
00:00:04.411 --> 00:00:07.230
<v Speaker 1>It was the richest country on the planet</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is,</v>

3
00:00:07.231 --> 00:00:09.450
<v Speaker 1>it was Richard than the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

4
00:00:09.451 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the United Kingdom.</v>

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.890
<v Speaker 1>Even when it was at the peak of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>British empire,</v>

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.123
<v Speaker 2>[inaudible]</v>

7
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:25.713
<v Speaker 1>middle of the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country had already gone down a few </v>

8
00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:28.684
<v Speaker 1>positions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it still remains one of the 10 </v>

9
00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.790
<v Speaker 1>richest and most prosperous countries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world today.</v>

10
00:00:33.791 --> 00:00:36.400
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not even in the top 60 so how can a</v>

11
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:41.401
<v Speaker 1>country suffer such a dramatic decline?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

12
00:00:42.751 --> 00:00:45.300
<v Speaker 1>it might have something to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fact that since roughly speaking,</v>

13
00:00:45.301 --> 00:00:49.560
<v Speaker 1>the 1940s Argentina has known only to </v>
<v Speaker 1>political movements,</v>

14
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.010
<v Speaker 1>military and Peronas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

15
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

16
00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.630
<v Speaker 1>Previous video here on the visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politic,</v>

17
00:01:02.631 --> 00:01:03.464
<v Speaker 1>we talked about the origins of Coronas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we saw how Juan Domingo Peron came </v>

18
00:01:06.981 --> 00:01:07.814
<v Speaker 1>to power wash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His political approach wasn't how in </v>

19
00:01:09.651 --> 00:01:13.080
<v Speaker 1>1955 he was overthrown by a new coo to </v>
<v Speaker 1>tops.</v>

20
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.030
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

21
00:01:14.031 --> 00:01:14.864
<v Speaker 1>what happens after this key?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happened to Argentina and how did </v>

22
00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.990
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] involve?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And perhaps most importantly,</v>

23
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.930
<v Speaker 1>what does it mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is Peruna Islam Today?</v>

24
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.920
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen,</v>

25
00:01:24.921 --> 00:01:29.921
<v Speaker 1>up in 1955 there were two cute atars </v>
<v Speaker 1>against Quando Quango Peron's government</v>

26
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>in the fast,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which proved unsuccessful.</v>

27
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.170
<v Speaker 1>The Argentine navy bombarded the Plaza </v>
<v Speaker 1>de Mayo in an attempt to,</v>

28
00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:45.720
<v Speaker 1>to end the president's life.</v>

29
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.453
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

30
00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.023
<v Speaker 3>That</v>

31
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.120
<v Speaker 1>it's just a few months later in </v>
<v Speaker 1>September of 1955 it did not fail.</v>

32
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

33
00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:03.683
<v Speaker 3>Got It.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You'd be [inaudible] [inaudible] </v>

34
00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.000
<v Speaker 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

35
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.940
<v Speaker 2>hello</v>

36
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.000
<v Speaker 1>to go into exile first in Venezuela,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then in Panama,</v>

37
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:23.040
<v Speaker 1>and then it's finally and Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 1>Franco,</v>

38
00:02:23.041 --> 00:02:23.874
<v Speaker 1>Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When the new government's arrived </v>

39
00:02:24.961 --> 00:02:25.794
<v Speaker 1>proclaiming the liberating revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brandism was literally outlawed </v>

40
00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.570
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Absolutely.</v>

41
00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:32.910
<v Speaker 1>Everything that had to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] image,</v>

42
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.800
<v Speaker 1>the marches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the symbols that Hims,</v>

43
00:02:34.801 --> 00:02:35.634
<v Speaker 1>the names,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything was prohibited by the </v>

44
00:02:37.381 --> 00:02:38.214
<v Speaker 1>military government.</v>

45
00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.390
<v Speaker 4>No.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I then feed off and even said,</v>

46
00:02:43.391 --> 00:02:48.080
<v Speaker 4>Addis [inaudible] America.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] is your list.</v>

47
00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.453
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

48
00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.363
<v Speaker 1>In just two years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this liberating revolution dismantled </v>

49
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.500
<v Speaker 1>every prunus structure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Before having new elections,</v>

50
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.630
<v Speaker 1>they even changed the constitution </v>
<v Speaker 1>again,</v>

51
00:02:58.631 --> 00:02:59.464
<v Speaker 1>so reestablish the one from 1853 </v>
<v Speaker 1>although they did introduce 14 articles </v>

52
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.700
<v Speaker 1>which introduced almost all the social </v>
<v Speaker 1>and interventionists measures that Peron</v>

53
00:03:06.701 --> 00:03:07.534
<v Speaker 1>had established.</v>

54
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:10.603
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

55
00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that history is hard to </v>
<v Speaker 1>forget.</v>

56
00:03:13.271 --> 00:03:14.104
<v Speaker 1>It's by forbidding everything that had </v>
<v Speaker 1>to do with Peronas and in a way the </v>

57
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.880
<v Speaker 1>military governments turns him into a </v>
<v Speaker 1>kind of,</v>

58
00:03:18.881 --> 00:03:19.714
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that in the following </v>

59
00:03:24.151 --> 00:03:26.860
<v Speaker 1>democratic elections in 1958 presidents </v>
<v Speaker 1>are,</v>

60
00:03:26.861 --> 00:03:27.694
<v Speaker 1>Toro from DC was elected a politician </v>
<v Speaker 1>who tried to turn Argentina her rounds </v>

61
00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:35.490
<v Speaker 1>and reopening it to the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is precisely what made the country</v>

62
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 1>one of the richest in the world.</v>

63
00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.980
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a moment because despite the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good economic results,</v>

64
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.740
<v Speaker 1>he had to face the peroneus unions and </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military.</v>

65
00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.980
<v Speaker 1>I had of course already gotten used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>playing with Argentina,</v>

66
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.660
<v Speaker 1>however they wished because,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

67
00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:53.494
<v Speaker 1>once the military boots is used,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's very hard to suppress the </v>

68
00:03:56.021 --> 00:03:59.770
<v Speaker 1>temptation to use it again and again.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that a few years later,</v>

69
00:03:59.771 --> 00:04:00.604
<v Speaker 1>the military demanded the resignation of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the democratic presidents from DC as </v>

70
00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.650
<v Speaker 1>well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did they do this?</v>

71
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.480
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>simply because they felt like us.</v>

72
00:04:07.481 --> 00:04:09.070
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much reason enough.</v>

73
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 1>Ans when the president didn't accept </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

74
00:04:10.931 --> 00:04:13.030
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what do you think the Argentine military</v>

75
00:04:13.031 --> 00:04:13.864
<v Speaker 1>did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

76
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably guessed right.</v>

77
00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.380
<v Speaker 1>They used weapons to depose and then </v>
<v Speaker 1>imprison him.</v>

78
00:04:18.381 --> 00:04:23.381
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is the little by little,</v>

79
00:04:26.251 --> 00:04:30.690
<v Speaker 1>the atmosphere became increasingly tense</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Peroneus themselves while mobilizing</v>

80
00:04:30.691 --> 00:04:31.524
<v Speaker 1>more and more demanding Peron's return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were elections and they are very </v>

81
00:04:34.621 --> 00:04:35.580
<v Speaker 1>fragile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our governments.</v>

82
00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:36.473
<v Speaker 1>What was the result of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The military made another cute to Ravi </v>

83
00:04:38.791 --> 00:04:41.490
<v Speaker 1>this time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They gave it a rather poetic name.</v>

84
00:04:41.491 --> 00:04:42.324
<v Speaker 1>In this case they called us the origins </v>
<v Speaker 1>Hein Revolution led by the guy your </v>

85
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:46.523
<v Speaker 1>seeing here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's a general Juan Carlos </v>

86
00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:49.223
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

87
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:51.683
<v Speaker 5>Why?</v>

88
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.463
<v Speaker 1>And this was the beginning of very tense</v>
<v Speaker 1>period because in addition to the </v>

89
00:05:06.931 --> 00:05:09.090
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cold war was going on.</v>

90
00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:09.983
<v Speaker 1>Man's in Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That generally meant struggles between </v>

91
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.310
<v Speaker 1>leftist guerrillas and military </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments,</v>

92
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.410
<v Speaker 1>Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were no exception.</v>

93
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.810
<v Speaker 5>I think we and we can</v>

94
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:23.450
<v Speaker 1>save it in the 1960s seventies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties work terrible,</v>

95
00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:26.150
<v Speaker 1>terrible years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>are pretty much all of Latin America and</v>

96
00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:26.984
<v Speaker 1>the following year is gorilla and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist groups began to emerge </v>

97
00:05:28.971 --> 00:05:31.370
<v Speaker 1>throughout Argentina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the Monta narrows,</v>

98
00:05:31.371 --> 00:05:34.550
<v Speaker 1>he revolutionary people's army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the people's armed forces,</v>

99
00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.473
<v Speaker 1>and check this out because Peron himself</v>
<v Speaker 1>had taken his strategic turns to the </v>

100
00:05:38.361 --> 00:05:42.830
<v Speaker 1>left and was now encouraging these types</v>
<v Speaker 1>of movements or from his home in Madrid,</v>

101
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.010
<v Speaker 1>which of course was located in Puerta to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Herro,</v>

102
00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.750
<v Speaker 1>one of the most expensive areas of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spanish capital.</v>

103
00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:56.270
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that between the bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>economic situation and the attacks,</v>

104
00:05:56.271 --> 00:05:57.104
<v Speaker 1>that was such huge amount of discontent </v>
<v Speaker 1>for the military regime was forced to </v>

105
00:06:00.531 --> 00:06:01.364
<v Speaker 1>call for elections in March of 1973 </v>
<v Speaker 1>although they of course left per on out </v>

106
00:06:05.151 --> 00:06:10.151
<v Speaker 1>under the excuse that he didn't live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina bugs.</v>

107
00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:17.050
<v Speaker 1>That's ultimately did it matter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And September of 1973 new elections were</v>

108
00:06:22.481 --> 00:06:25.990
<v Speaker 1>held cannes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This time Juan Domingo Peron was elected</v>

109
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:26.824
<v Speaker 1>presidents with check this out,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife Isabel Martinez dip around as </v>

110
00:06:30.611 --> 00:06:31.330
<v Speaker 1>vice president.</v>

111
00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:32.163
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

112
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.760
<v Speaker 1>It was simply easier that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everything stayed in the family,</v>

113
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.740
<v Speaker 1>the president and vice president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tandem one,</v>

114
00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:47.170
<v Speaker 1>them an overwhelming victory with </v>
<v Speaker 1>approximately 60% of the vote.</v>

115
00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:54.490
<v Speaker 1>But hold on a moment because it wouldn't</v>
<v Speaker 1>be that easy.</v>

116
00:06:54.520 --> 00:06:55.353
<v Speaker 1>Listen up the return.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One thing needs to be clear if that is </v>

117
00:07:08.561 --> 00:07:10.330
<v Speaker 1>an unwritten law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In politics,</v>

118
00:07:10.331 --> 00:07:11.164
<v Speaker 1>opposition is one thing and governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>are very different one and that law </v>

119
00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.930
<v Speaker 1>certainly applied to quantum domingo</v>

120
00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:17.883
<v Speaker 2>or on</v>

121
00:07:21.930 --> 00:07:24.630
<v Speaker 1>see as we mentioned before,</v>
<v Speaker 1>during his time in exile,</v>

122
00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:28.380
<v Speaker 1>he became a point of reference for every</v>
<v Speaker 1>opponent of the dictatorship.</v>

123
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.273
<v Speaker 1>But if on the left and on the rise,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but of course this friendship between </v>

124
00:07:31.741 --> 00:07:35.840
<v Speaker 1>the extremes once the dictatorship fell </v>
<v Speaker 1>was doomed to fall not long after,</v>

125
00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:38.340
<v Speaker 1>and that the viewer is precisely what </v>
<v Speaker 1>happens.</v>

126
00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.400
<v Speaker 1>And in a very violent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the situation got out of hands.</v>

127
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.380
<v Speaker 1>The leftist guerrilla groups continue to</v>
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>

128
00:07:46.381 --> 00:07:47.640
<v Speaker 1>Civilians,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians,</v>

129
00:07:47.641 --> 00:07:48.474
<v Speaker 1>businessmen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as well as the military per on was no </v>

130
00:07:50.431 --> 00:07:52.950
<v Speaker 1>longer enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They once it's a popular revolution,</v>

131
00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.050
<v Speaker 1>well at least that's what they called </v>
<v Speaker 1>it.</v>

132
00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:04.080
<v Speaker 1>And if we're in this government </v>
<v Speaker 1>responded by promoting the creation.</v>

133
00:08:04.140 --> 00:08:04.973
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have a para military group known as the </v>

134
00:08:07.561 --> 00:08:11.070
<v Speaker 1>triple aim anticommunist Argentinian </v>
<v Speaker 1>association.</v>

135
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.620
<v Speaker 1>The results of all of this mixed was </v>
<v Speaker 1>tension there,</v>

136
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:17.010
<v Speaker 1>confrontations and disappearances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if that wasn't enough,</v>

137
00:08:17.011 --> 00:08:20.250
<v Speaker 1>the economy also ends from bat much </v>
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

138
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:26.910
<v Speaker 1>So problems were done.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was becoming a bit of a nes,</v>

139
00:08:26.911 --> 00:08:29.050
<v Speaker 1>and it didn't last very long because on </v>
<v Speaker 1>July,</v>

140
00:08:29.051 --> 00:08:32.050
<v Speaker 1>the first 1974 funds and being gay per </v>
<v Speaker 1>on his days,</v>

141
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:36.010
<v Speaker 1>they came to an end and he left behind a</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrible legacy.</v>

142
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:39.860
<v Speaker 1>In 1975 the war between Peronas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's under a proneness to government,</v>

143
00:08:39.910 --> 00:08:40.743
<v Speaker 1>was at its peak,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's the economic crisis led to a </v>

144
00:08:42.761 --> 00:08:46.090
<v Speaker 1>brutal devaluation that left the peso in</v>
<v Speaker 1>tatters.</v>

145
00:08:49.730 --> 00:08:50.563
<v Speaker 1>With this panorama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably imagine followed a new </v>

146
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.100
<v Speaker 1>queue to tar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was not just by anyone.</v>

147
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:56.993
<v Speaker 1>The darkest periods in Argentine history</v>
<v Speaker 1>began on March the 24th 1976 the </v>

148
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:01.883
<v Speaker 1>military junta government rose to power </v>
<v Speaker 1>leds by Jorge Rafaelle of the dealer </v>

149
00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:05.953
<v Speaker 1>who's period leading Argentina was </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized by the permanent </v>

150
00:09:08.191 --> 00:09:10.170
<v Speaker 1>violations of individual rights.</v>

151
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.560
<v Speaker 3>Cool.</v>
<v Speaker 3>We've got got,</v>

152
00:09:16.700 --> 00:09:17.533
<v Speaker 3>he'd pick up when,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I mean that I've had that board about </v>

153
00:09:19.650 --> 00:09:20.483
<v Speaker 3>patio there.</v>

154
00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:24.520
<v Speaker 1>The military left behind terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>numbers.</v>

155
00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.383
<v Speaker 1>More than 10,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>disappeared and thousands and thousands </v>

156
00:09:27.701 --> 00:09:28.534
<v Speaker 1>more became political prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But did you have just a moment here </v>

157
00:09:30.371 --> 00:09:32.890
<v Speaker 1>because if you think ism was dead at </v>
<v Speaker 1>this time,</v>

158
00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:34.570
<v Speaker 1>well you're very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very wrong.</v>

159
00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:41.780
<v Speaker 1>A new ride.</v>

160
00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:42.873
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

161
00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:48.560
<v Speaker 1>After the dark and terrible periods of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the military junta democracy returned to</v>

162
00:09:48.561 --> 00:09:50.390
<v Speaker 1>Argentina in 1983</v>

163
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:57.913
<v Speaker 2>five</v>

164
00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.553
<v Speaker 1>at that time the brain is sweat </v>
<v Speaker 1>dismantled and a new president was </v>

165
00:10:05.171 --> 00:10:06.004
<v Speaker 1>elected,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Raul Alfonsin who the elgin dines most </v>

166
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:10.720
<v Speaker 1>remember for the hyperinflation that </v>
<v Speaker 1>occurred under his rule.</v>

167
00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.020
<v Speaker 2>Oh trust me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't thank God.</v>

168
00:10:28.281 --> 00:10:29.560
<v Speaker 2>And I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what do you got?</v>

169
00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.753
<v Speaker 1>Inflation soared to over 80% per month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is pretty much what happens when </v>

170
00:10:35.491 --> 00:10:37.950
<v Speaker 1>you just run the money printing </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines.</v>

171
00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:41.100
<v Speaker 1>And on top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both the military again and the Peroneus</v>

172
00:10:41.101 --> 00:10:44.040
<v Speaker 1>do unions decided to make this </v>
<v Speaker 1>government inoperable?</v>

173
00:10:44.070 --> 00:10:48.660
<v Speaker 1>The strikes were absolutely endless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So once they were reorganized,</v>

174
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:49.523
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the Peroneus returns this time </v>

175
00:10:51.301 --> 00:10:55.380
<v Speaker 1>under the leadership of Carlos Soul men </v>
<v Speaker 1>m and surprise,</v>

176
00:11:07.890 --> 00:11:10.500
<v Speaker 1>the new president's off to two terrible </v>
<v Speaker 1>first years,</v>

177
00:11:10.501 --> 00:11:11.334
<v Speaker 1>took a 180 degree turn and to knowledge </v>
<v Speaker 1>to policies that were completely </v>

178
00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.720
<v Speaker 1>unexpected for a peroneus governments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He brought a wave of privatizations,</v>

179
00:11:18.721 --> 00:11:19.554
<v Speaker 1>liberalized the economy and trade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even achieved a monetary stability by </v>

180
00:11:23.011 --> 00:11:26.610
<v Speaker 1>introducing the ones a one peso US </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollar exchange rate.</v>

181
00:11:32.390 --> 00:11:35.030
<v Speaker 1>Martin investments began to arrive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade grew,</v>

182
00:11:35.031 --> 00:11:35.864
<v Speaker 1>and as the Arjun tines where again </v>
<v Speaker 1>prospering and feeling like they could </v>

183
00:11:39.171 --> 00:11:42.020
<v Speaker 1>rise up in the world again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bars and my friend's president,</v>

184
00:11:42.021 --> 00:11:42.854
<v Speaker 1>Menem did not do one thing and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>president macri take note here because </v>

185
00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.650
<v Speaker 1>he did not reduce public spending on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

186
00:11:48.680 --> 00:11:49.513
<v Speaker 1>Public spending absolutely skyrocketed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so did corruption and waste of all </v>

187
00:11:54.310 --> 00:11:59.310
<v Speaker 1>varieties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm awesome.</v>

188
00:12:00.230 --> 00:12:03.020
<v Speaker 1>More since things were going smoothly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reforms,</v>

189
00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:03.883
<v Speaker 1>they won't complete it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even Argentina with an overvalued </v>

190
00:12:06.411 --> 00:12:08.900
<v Speaker 1>currency,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge public expenditure,</v>

191
00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.660
<v Speaker 1>many imports and a ton of debt</v>

192
00:12:16.130 --> 00:12:20.370
<v Speaker 1>and you can probably guess what happened</v>
<v Speaker 1>is in 1999 the opposition took over.</v>

193
00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:21.833
<v Speaker 1>It was too late.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The crisis peaked in 2001 Argentina </v>

194
00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.890
<v Speaker 1>defaulted and the origin Argentines </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered.</v>

195
00:12:26.940 --> 00:12:27.773
<v Speaker 1>The famous Cora Alito under this </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation in 2003 you gas disc corona </v>

196
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:33.323
<v Speaker 1>returned to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The brutus disability to wriggle out of </v>

197
00:12:35.581 --> 00:12:37.290
<v Speaker 1>the line of falls into blame.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others.</v>

198
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.153
<v Speaker 1>It's actually pretty admirable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've almost always been in </v>

199
00:12:40.231 --> 00:12:41.064
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but apparently they've never been to </v>

200
00:12:42.451 --> 00:12:45.360
<v Speaker 1>blame for anything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who came to power here?</v>

201
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:46.253
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would be the Coachnas proneness who </v>

202
00:12:48.001 --> 00:12:51.240
<v Speaker 1>has the same policies as always.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Only this time,</v>

203
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.760
<v Speaker 1>very much more inclined to the left.</v>

204
00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:55.473
<v Speaker 2>Remember,</v>

205
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.710
<v Speaker 1>during the years and the Casa Rosada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Argentine Whitehouse,</v>

206
00:13:05.750 --> 00:13:08.570
<v Speaker 1>could they restricted imports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplied public spending,</v>

207
00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:13.490
<v Speaker 1>inflation taxes and debt boss?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Give you just a moment because before we</v>

208
00:13:13.491 --> 00:13:16.250
<v Speaker 1>finish the video today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have one last question.</v>

209
00:13:16.810 --> 00:13:17.780
<v Speaker 1>It's a really important,</v>

210
00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:23.073
<v Speaker 2>what</v>

211
00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.860
<v Speaker 1>spout on Islam,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is Peronas it?</v>

212
00:13:29.890 --> 00:13:30.723
<v Speaker 1>How is it managed to be almost hegemonic</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Argentina despite the fact that it </v>

213
00:13:34.511 --> 00:13:38.440
<v Speaker 1>sounded terrible results?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are the truly important questions.</v>

214
00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:39.221
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the viewer,</v>

215
00:13:39.221 --> 00:13:40.960
<v Speaker 1>I think that taking history into </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts,</v>

216
00:13:40.961 --> 00:13:41.794
<v Speaker 1>we can say the personas in more than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political party is a movements with two </v>

217
00:13:45.460 --> 00:13:46.293
<v Speaker 1>essential pillars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>excessive interventionism and public </v>

218
00:13:48.941 --> 00:13:49.774
<v Speaker 1>spending.</v>

219
00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:51.523
<v Speaker 6>Amen.</v>

220
00:13:58.520 --> 00:14:01.850
<v Speaker 1>The secrets of their political success </v>
<v Speaker 1>has to do with this.</v>

221
00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:02.743
<v Speaker 1>Every time Argentina has a problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Peroneus promised more and more </v>

222
00:14:06.111 --> 00:14:06.944
<v Speaker 1>public spending all of course financed </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the populist politicians favorite </v>

223
00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:11.233
<v Speaker 1>instrument,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bill printing machine under the </v>

224
00:14:13.581 --> 00:14:16.310
<v Speaker 1>excuse of political sovereignty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>economic independence,</v>

225
00:14:16.311 --> 00:14:17.144
<v Speaker 1>and social justice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The three faces established by Juan </v>

226
00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:24.080
<v Speaker 1>Domingo Peron Peronas have ended up in </v>
<v Speaker 1>making Argentina a country that is close</v>

227
00:14:24.081 --> 00:14:24.914
<v Speaker 1>to the wells that has longterm monstrous</v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation and practically lives in </v>

228
00:14:28.911 --> 00:14:32.330
<v Speaker 1>permanent crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question really becomes,</v>

229
00:14:32.390 --> 00:14:34.430
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps time to find another way.</v>

230
00:14:34.490 --> 00:14:35.323
<v Speaker 1>So now it's your turn from one to five.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is your degree of confidence in </v>

231
00:14:38.220 --> 00:14:39.053
<v Speaker 1>Argentina is future?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You can leave your answer in the </v>
