1
00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.350
<v Speaker 1>That's conducted experiments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just go and Google these two words.</v>

2
00:00:04.351 --> 00:00:06.060
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump,</v>

3
00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.790
<v Speaker 1>what did you get when you googled them?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

4
00:00:12.791 --> 00:00:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you found lots of results about</v>
<v Speaker 1>his latest tweets,</v>

5
00:00:16.031 --> 00:00:20.560
<v Speaker 1>his latest bold statements,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe his latest sexual scandal,</v>

6
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:21.443
<v Speaker 1>but you probably have to click to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seconds or even the third page to find </v>

7
00:00:24.731 --> 00:00:29.320
<v Speaker 1>out anything about what is actually one </v>
<v Speaker 1>of his biggest political bats.</v>

8
00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:33.040
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about something that might</v>
<v Speaker 1>change the international economy.</v>

9
00:00:33.041 --> 00:00:36.520
<v Speaker 1>It might change the price of oil and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>fate of two countries.</v>

10
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer,</v>

11
00:00:38.141 --> 00:00:40.360
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or maybe not.</v>

12
00:00:40.361 --> 00:00:42.430
<v Speaker 1>Of course it was on that third page of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Google.</v>

13
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.730
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the Iran sanctions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is such a complex matter,</v>

14
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.900
<v Speaker 1>but we will make not one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not two,</v>

15
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:56.740
<v Speaker 1>but three videos covering all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>various caveats.</v>

16
00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.650
<v Speaker 1>In today's video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to focus on one question.</v>

17
00:00:59.651 --> 00:01:03.610
<v Speaker 1>What does the nuclear program have to do</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the price of oil,</v>

18
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.643
<v Speaker 1>and at the end of this video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're going to see where I'm coming </v>

19
00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:11.011
<v Speaker 1>from.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As with every good story,</v>

20
00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.370
<v Speaker 1>we should start by introducing our </v>
<v Speaker 1>characters.</v>

21
00:01:17.371 --> 00:01:20.880
<v Speaker 1>The first one is of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamic Republic of Iran,</v>

22
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:24.210
<v Speaker 1>a country known for Persian carpets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uranium enrichments,</v>

23
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>and of course oil.</v>

24
00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.110
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

25
00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.790
<v Speaker 1>Iran has the fourth largest amount of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dinosaur juice reserves on the planet,</v>

26
00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:36.683
<v Speaker 1>but that is not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you've been subscribed to visual </v>

27
00:01:38.641 --> 00:01:39.474
<v Speaker 1>politic for a long time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know that there are </v>

28
00:01:41.101 --> 00:01:42.810
<v Speaker 1>different types of crude oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

29
00:01:42.811 --> 00:01:46.110
<v Speaker 1>if you want to extract an oil barrel in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Scotland from the North Sea,</v>

30
00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.123
<v Speaker 1>you've got to build a sea platform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've got to make a super deep hole </v>

31
00:01:49.621 --> 00:01:50.454
<v Speaker 1>that goes below the bottom of the ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then use a rocket technology to </v>

32
00:01:54.361 --> 00:01:55.950
<v Speaker 1>refine it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In total,</v>

33
00:01:55.951 --> 00:02:00.690
<v Speaker 1>a barrel has an extraction cost of more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than $44 in Iran.</v>

34
00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.480
<v Speaker 1>The extraction cost is less than a </v>
<v Speaker 1>fourth of that.</v>

35
00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:04.603
<v Speaker 1>Along with Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have the cheapest oil on the </v>

36
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:08.364
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>

37
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.710
<v Speaker 3>so well,</v>
<v Speaker 3>what's the problem?</v>

38
00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:17.780
<v Speaker 3>Jeep all sounds great.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Well,</v>

39
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:18.643
<v Speaker 3>they can't sell it to to most countries.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Iran's economy is virtually isolated </v>

40
00:02:22.701 --> 00:02:23.534
<v Speaker 3>from the rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This means they can only export about 3 </v>

41
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:30.170
<v Speaker 3>million barrels per day of oil.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Although due to the threat of sanctions,</v>

42
00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.690
<v Speaker 3>there are currently only exporting about</v>
<v Speaker 3>1 million barrels.</v>

43
00:02:32.691 --> 00:02:32.780
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

44
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.613
<v Speaker 2>per day.</v>

45
00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.470
<v Speaker 3>That might seem like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but it's nothing.</v>

46
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:38.333
<v Speaker 3>If we compare it with the 7.5</v>
<v Speaker 3>million barrels per day currently being </v>

47
00:02:42.241 --> 00:02:43.074
<v Speaker 3>exploited by Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which is currently producing nearly 11 </v>

48
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.690
<v Speaker 3>million barrels per day in total,</v>

49
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.780
<v Speaker 1>it's an the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering.</v>

50
00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:50.531
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

51
00:02:50.531 --> 00:02:53.790
<v Speaker 1>who is Iran's worst enemy is America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ryan Stone.</v>

52
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.580
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

53
00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:59.473
<v Speaker 1>you're wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Aaron's arch enemy is actually Saudi </v>

54
00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.630
<v Speaker 1>Arabia and yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know both countries or Muslim,</v>

55
00:03:04.631 --> 00:03:05.464
<v Speaker 1>both countries follow strict religious </v>
<v Speaker 1>principles and both countries consider </v>

56
00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.050
<v Speaker 1>human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well optional,</v>

57
00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.930
<v Speaker 1>but not all of Islam is the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And Iran,</v>

58
00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.793
<v Speaker 1>Shia Muslims are the majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim </v>

59
00:03:18.821 --> 00:03:22.450
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you surmise they hate each other,</v>

60
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.970
<v Speaker 1>but that's another story for another </v>
<v Speaker 1>video.</v>

61
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.670
<v Speaker 1>So what is Saudi Arabia's problem?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:27.671 --> 00:03:29.620
<v Speaker 1>despite having oil and lots of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>

63
00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:34.621
<v Speaker 1>comedy is the edge of collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically they spend all of them.</v>

64
00:03:37.451 --> 00:03:40.430
<v Speaker 1>I need living like a hip hop artists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On a Friday night.</v>

65
00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:43.250
<v Speaker 1>And since they don't export anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>other than than oil,</v>

66
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.090
<v Speaker 1>anytime the price of the barrel of oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes down on the market,</v>

67
00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 1>their economy goes into panic mode.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

68
00:03:50.631 --> 00:03:53.150
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who's Saudi Arabia's best friends?</v>

69
00:03:53.151 --> 00:03:56.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is actually when America comes into</v>

70
00:03:56.211 --> 00:03:57.044
<v Speaker 1>the picture.</v>

71
00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:57.903
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

72
00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:00.491
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>

73
00:04:00.491 --> 00:04:01.324
<v Speaker 1>So the relationship between Uncle Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the Saudi royal house is not as </v>

74
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:08.200
<v Speaker 1>wonderful as it seems from the outside.</v>
<v Speaker 1>During the Obama administration,</v>

75
00:04:08.201 --> 00:04:09.034
<v Speaker 1>the White House puts some pressure on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Saudis and tried to get closer ties </v>

76
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.244
<v Speaker 1>with Iran.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how that nuclear deal came </v>

77
00:04:14.261 --> 00:04:19.261
<v Speaker 1>about.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the president is Donald Trump,</v>

78
00:04:21.961 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 1>and from the moment he stepped into the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Oval Office,</v>

79
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:25.404
<v Speaker 1>trump has made it clear who is ally in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Middle East was this is why his </v>

80
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:32.430
<v Speaker 1>first official trip was to the Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 1>capital of Riyadh.</v>

81
00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.113
<v Speaker 1>Even now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the alleged murder of a Saudi </v>

82
00:04:39.891 --> 00:04:43.340
<v Speaker 1>journalist in Turkey,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump is trying to avoid making a</v>

83
00:04:43.341 --> 00:04:44.174
<v Speaker 1>from condemnation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the best proof of his friendship </v>

84
00:04:46.281 --> 00:04:50.240
<v Speaker 1>with the Saudi royal house are the Iran </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear sanctions.</v>

85
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:51.380
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that,</v>

86
00:04:51.381 --> 00:04:52.820
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

87
00:04:52.821 --> 00:04:53.654
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does Saudi Arabia have to do with </v>

88
00:04:55.821 --> 00:04:56.654
<v Speaker 1>Iran sanctions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What does oil have to do with any of </v>

89
00:04:59.121 --> 00:04:59.811
<v Speaker 1>this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:04:59.811 --> 00:05:01.790
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

91
00:05:01.791 --> 00:05:03.890
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as always,</v>

92
00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.270
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back at the head</v>

93
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:06.233
<v Speaker 4>straight</v>

94
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.720
<v Speaker 1>political ball.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember this date,</v>

95
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:14.860
<v Speaker 1>April,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2015 this was the date when Barack Obama</v>

96
00:05:14.861 --> 00:05:18.070
<v Speaker 1>signs the Iran nuclear deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically in this agreement,</v>

97
00:05:18.071 --> 00:05:18.910
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

98
00:05:18.911 --> 00:05:19.744
<v Speaker 1>Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the European Union said that they </v>

99
00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:24.730
<v Speaker 1>would start trading with Iran if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>stopped then nuclear program.</v>

100
00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:25.833
<v Speaker 1>This explains why from one day to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next oil exports from Iran almost </v>

101
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.250
<v Speaker 1>doubled.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just have a look at this</v>

102
00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:32.153
<v Speaker 4>chops</v>

103
00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:38.440
<v Speaker 1>to Obama's deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran.</v>

104
00:05:38.441 --> 00:05:41.670
<v Speaker 1>Ron was making 1.8</v>
<v Speaker 1>million barrels a day after the deal.</v>

105
00:05:41.671 --> 00:05:45.240
<v Speaker 1>Iran increased it to as much as 3 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million barrels.</v>

106
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Then Yukon's bill,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how was Spain,</v>

107
00:05:46.951 --> 00:05:48.990
<v Speaker 1>France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and other European countries,</v>

108
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.650
<v Speaker 1>and what happens when the oil supply on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the international market increases?</v>

109
00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:53.513
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the price of a barrel of oil drops and </v>

110
00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.910
<v Speaker 1>you just have a look at this other </v>
<v Speaker 1>chart.</v>

111
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:04.640
<v Speaker 1>At the moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deal was signed.</v>

112
00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:08.780
<v Speaker 1>The brand's barrel with 67 US dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>just a year later.</v>

113
00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.700
<v Speaker 1>It was twice as cheap.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

114
00:06:10.701 --> 00:06:13.370
<v Speaker 1>there are many other factors that could </v>
<v Speaker 1>explain this price drop,</v>

115
00:06:13.371 --> 00:06:15.710
<v Speaker 1>but Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was definitely one of them,</v>

116
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.873
<v Speaker 1>but the,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a minute because this </v>

117
00:06:17.721 --> 00:06:20.000
<v Speaker 1>really is just the beginning of our </v>
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>

118
00:06:20.001 --> 00:06:22.250
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>longtime visual politics subscribers,</v>

119
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.113
<v Speaker 1>which you should be subscribed below,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you already know how hard it is to </v>

120
00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>extract oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need technology,</v>

121
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:31.880
<v Speaker 1>you need companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you need money and lots of it.</v>

122
00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:32.803
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if the National Iranian oil company </v>

123
00:06:34.641 --> 00:06:38.810
<v Speaker 1>wanted to produce more oil barrels,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they needed investors,</v>

124
00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.330
<v Speaker 1>and this was when the real financial bom</v>
<v Speaker 1>APP,</v>

125
00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:44.173
<v Speaker 1>so lately draw,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're Rabia is considering an IPO of </v>

126
00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:51.534
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Aramco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>potentially the world's most valuable </v>

127
00:06:54.121 --> 00:06:58.200
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's pause right there.</v>

128
00:06:58.290 --> 00:07:01.500
<v Speaker 1>Why is this news so important for our </v>
<v Speaker 1>story?</v>

129
00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.810
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's rewind a little further.</v>

130
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:27.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

131
00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:30.640
<v Speaker 1>Financial explosion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now I'm going to ask you a question.</v>

132
00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.040
<v Speaker 1>What is the world's biggest company?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

133
00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:36.430
<v Speaker 1>many of you might reply with apple or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola or,</v>

134
00:07:36.431 --> 00:07:39.850
<v Speaker 1>or maybe some big bank somewhere that </v>
<v Speaker 1>you might've heard of.</v>

135
00:07:39.910 --> 00:07:40.511
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>actually,</v>

136
00:07:40.511 --> 00:07:41.344
<v Speaker 1>it's none of those things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The world's biggest company is actually </v>

137
00:07:43.241 --> 00:07:44.074
<v Speaker 1>Aramco.</v>

138
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:49.140
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

139
00:07:49.140 --> 00:07:52.260
<v Speaker 1>This is Saudi Arabia's national oil </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

140
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.213
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they waste your time finding it on the </v>

141
00:07:54.451 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 1>stock market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only is it not public,</v>

142
00:07:57.300 --> 00:07:59.940
<v Speaker 1>Aramco is owned by the Saudi royal </v>
<v Speaker 1>family.</v>

143
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:07.880
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>having the world's biggest company,</v>

144
00:08:07.881 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't mean you can't go bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You'll see as oil prices go down,</v>

145
00:08:12.411 --> 00:08:17.240
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia is in dire straits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to diversify their economy.</v>

146
00:08:17.241 --> 00:08:20.810
<v Speaker 1>They've got to gain wealth from other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things other than just petroleum.</v>

147
00:08:21.110 --> 00:08:23.360
<v Speaker 1>So how can they do this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:25.750
<v Speaker 1>essentially the big idea was to start a </v>
<v Speaker 1>hedge.</v>

149
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:33.250
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Audio Rabia</v>

150
00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.060
<v Speaker 1>wants to grow its sovereign wealth fund </v>
<v Speaker 1>to over $2 trillion.</v>

151
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:38.820
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weird as this might seem,</v>

152
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.610
<v Speaker 1>this wouldn't be the first time a whole </v>
<v Speaker 1>country invested in businesses.</v>

153
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world's biggest hedge funds actually</v>

154
00:08:45.461 --> 00:08:48.310
<v Speaker 1>belongs to the Norwegian government.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This audis,</v>

155
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:49.750
<v Speaker 1>they just want to make something </v>
<v Speaker 1>similar.</v>

156
00:08:49.780 --> 00:08:52.810
<v Speaker 1>So this all sounds pretty good.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's the problem,</v>

157
00:08:52.811 --> 00:08:53.740
<v Speaker 1>Simon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

158
00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:56.730
<v Speaker 1>they need money then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's 20 of the world's biggest company.</v>

159
00:08:56.731 --> 00:08:58.050
<v Speaker 1>Where did you get money from?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

160
00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:58.913
<v Speaker 1>you just sell something,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your company on the stock markets and </v>

161
00:09:00.451 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>that gives you all of the cash you need.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's basic business.</v>

162
00:09:03.060 --> 00:09:03.893
<v Speaker 1>This way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Saudi royal family would kill two </v>

163
00:09:05.551 --> 00:09:09.420
<v Speaker 1>birds with one stone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First they make money and they also keep</v>

164
00:09:09.421 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 1>Iran from getting that juicy investors' </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

165
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:13.703
<v Speaker 1>You remember how he told you when in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016 around once invest investors to </v>

166
00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:19.440
<v Speaker 1>build new oil rig swelled before those </v>
<v Speaker 1>investors would consider Iran,</v>

167
00:09:19.590 --> 00:09:24.390
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia at wanted to dangle a suite</v>
<v Speaker 1>at piece of candy in front of their eyes</v>

168
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:27.030
<v Speaker 1>and that was of course Aramco,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute,</v>

169
00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.013
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't that</v>

170
00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.313
<v Speaker 3>he see listing a company on the stock </v>
<v Speaker 3>market is great cause all of a sudden </v>

171
00:09:36.691 --> 00:09:37.524
<v Speaker 3>you get a lot of cats.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The problem and your turn for being a </v>

172
00:09:42.621 --> 00:09:43.454
<v Speaker 3>publicly listed company,</v>
<v Speaker 3>you must make your books publicly </v>

173
00:09:46.101 --> 00:09:49.310
<v Speaker 3>available after all,</v>
<v Speaker 3>no one would invest in a company if they</v>

174
00:09:49.311 --> 00:09:50.144
<v Speaker 3>can't see that company's financial </v>
<v Speaker 3>statements to see how they're making </v>

175
00:09:52.971 --> 00:09:55.250
<v Speaker 3>money and how they're spending it.</v>
<v Speaker 3>In other words,</v>

176
00:09:55.370 --> 00:09:56.203
<v Speaker 3>you've got to be transparent and you </v>
<v Speaker 3>have to remember that transparency is </v>

177
00:09:59.241 --> 00:10:02.540
<v Speaker 3>the least favorite word of the Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 3>royal house.</v>

178
00:10:02.630 --> 00:10:03.463
<v Speaker 3>You'll see for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Saudi Monique's have basically been </v>

179
00:10:04.971 --> 00:10:07.900
<v Speaker 3>using Aramco for anything they wanted,</v>
<v Speaker 3>policies,</v>

180
00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:08.853
<v Speaker 1>luxury,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and those sorts of things that you </v>

181
00:10:10.551 --> 00:10:14.470
<v Speaker 1>probably don't even want to know about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this is not the problem.</v>

182
00:10:14.590 --> 00:10:15.423
<v Speaker 1>According to Prince Mohammed bin Salman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as mbs Aramco is worth $2 </v>

183
00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.830
<v Speaker 1>trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that this 5% he wants to sell</v>

184
00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.890
<v Speaker 1>would be worth $100 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

185
00:10:26.891 --> 00:10:28.960
<v Speaker 1>as soon as he started talking about the </v>
<v Speaker 1>IPA,</v>

186
00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:33.190
<v Speaker 1>all these various financial analyst </v>
<v Speaker 1>started making their own estimations and</v>

187
00:10:33.191 --> 00:10:37.420
<v Speaker 1>they essentially said $2 trillion bad </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the price of oil falling like this.</v>

188
00:10:37.540 --> 00:10:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Are you smoking crack?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Best case scenario,</v>

189
00:10:40.211 --> 00:10:41.044
<v Speaker 1>best case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're looking at one point 2 trillion </v>

190
00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:45.670
<v Speaker 1>or one point 5 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>F we're being rarely,</v>

191
00:10:45.671 --> 00:10:46.870
<v Speaker 1>rarely generous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hello?</v>

192
00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.560
<v Speaker 1>Where's that financial explosion that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Aramco Ipo was supposed to be?</v>

193
00:10:50.561 --> 00:10:53.830
<v Speaker 1>Basically the game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing but a buzzword and he's,</v>

194
00:10:53.831 --> 00:10:56.380
<v Speaker 1>I'm in the past year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyone asked Prince Salomon,</v>

195
00:10:56.381 --> 00:10:59.890
<v Speaker 1>what he thought about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It basically kind of respond like this.</v>

196
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.180
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah.</v>

197
00:11:01.181 --> 00:11:01.871
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know,</v>

198
00:11:01.871 --> 00:11:03.490
<v Speaker 1>man,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's legit.</v>

199
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.150
<v Speaker 1>Another day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm busy with print stuff at later,</v>

200
00:11:07.151 --> 00:11:07.870
<v Speaker 1>man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Later.</v>

201
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.620
<v Speaker 1>Hold on a moment because this is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the end of our story.</v>

202
00:11:11.970 --> 00:11:12.803
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

203
00:11:15.570 --> 00:11:16.403
<v Speaker 1>A crater in the markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Here's another day for you to remember </v>

204
00:11:18.771 --> 00:11:23.771
<v Speaker 1>that may at 2018 this is the moment when</v>
<v Speaker 1>trump broke the Iran deal and announce a</v>

205
00:11:23.991 --> 00:11:25.000
<v Speaker 1>new economic sanctions.</v>

206
00:11:28.650 --> 00:11:29.060
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

207
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:29.893
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he also promised secondary sanctions </v>

208
00:11:31.731 --> 00:11:33.890
<v Speaker 1>against those countries that would not </v>
<v Speaker 1>comply.</v>

209
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:34.933
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if any country wants to buy oil from </v>

210
00:11:36.441 --> 00:11:37.011
<v Speaker 1>Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

211
00:11:37.011 --> 00:11:37.844
<v Speaker 1>they'd also have to deal with Uncle Sam </v>
<v Speaker 1>and June off Agastya that that also </v>

212
00:11:41.091 --> 00:11:44.870
<v Speaker 1>includes the end higher European Union.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Other countries don't really catch.</v>

213
00:11:44.871 --> 00:11:46.070
<v Speaker 1>I know for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has said,</v>

214
00:11:46.071 --> 00:11:47.420
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't care trump,</v>

215
00:11:47.421 --> 00:11:49.250
<v Speaker 1>whatever,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to buy it all from Iran.</v>

216
00:11:49.460 --> 00:11:50.293
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second largest client has said that </v>

217
00:11:51.831 --> 00:11:54.200
<v Speaker 1>they will try to reduce imports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but they can't.</v>

218
00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:57.090
<v Speaker 1>100% stopped buying all from the country</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the ayatollah.</v>

219
00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.630
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it seems like the EU will have to follow</v>

220
00:12:05.660 --> 00:12:08.600
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump to the latter even if they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to,</v>

221
00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.530
<v Speaker 1>but this as a matter we're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to discuss in the next video.</v>

222
00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:13.423
<v Speaker 1>The truth is nowadays Europe is buying </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 1 million barrels from Iran </v>

223
00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:19.280
<v Speaker 1>every day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means if we take it ron,</v>

224
00:12:19.281 --> 00:12:20.114
<v Speaker 1>out of the equation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a whole 1 million barrel order </v>

225
00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:24.763
<v Speaker 1>of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Somebody has to fill because you know </v>

226
00:12:26.301 --> 00:12:29.750
<v Speaker 1>one thing is absolutely clear throughout</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this,</v>

227
00:12:30.050 --> 00:12:30.883
<v Speaker 1>everybody needs that sweet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sweet dinosaur juice and I bet you can </v>

228
00:12:34.791 --> 00:12:38.780
<v Speaker 1>guess now who is very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very happy to be filling that role.</v>

229
00:12:38.830 --> 00:12:39.663
<v Speaker 2>Boy,</v>

230
00:12:43.370 --> 00:12:46.820
<v Speaker 1>trump pressures Saudi Arabia to increase</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil production.</v>

231
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:47.893
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia just increased its </v>

232
00:12:49.221 --> 00:12:51.740
<v Speaker 1>production by 600,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>barrels.</v>

233
00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:55.190
<v Speaker 1>Russia has done say by 200,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you do the math,</v>

234
00:12:55.220 --> 00:12:57.140
<v Speaker 1>it's not tricky.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You get 800,000</v>

235
00:12:57.141 --> 00:12:57.974
<v Speaker 1>barrels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We still need more to fill that huge </v>

236
00:13:00.771 --> 00:13:01.604
<v Speaker 1>void and you probably also remember what</v>
<v Speaker 1>happens when we reduce the oil offering </v>

237
00:13:05.091 --> 00:13:07.550
<v Speaker 1>on the international market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh Yeah,</v>

238
00:13:07.551 --> 00:13:12.320
<v Speaker 1>supply and demand kicks in and the price</v>
<v Speaker 1>of that oil barrel goes up.</v>

239
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:17.500
<v Speaker 1>Let's get back to our Brent shot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you pay attention,</v>

240
00:13:19.461 --> 00:13:20.294
<v Speaker 1>you will see that right after trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>started talking about the Iran </v>

241
00:13:22.611 --> 00:13:24.440
<v Speaker 1>sanctions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the dyno juice,</v>

242
00:13:24.441 --> 00:13:28.430
<v Speaker 1>it went up to $80 in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>things are starting to go really,</v>

243
00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:30.260
<v Speaker 1>really well for the Saudi economy.</v>

244
00:13:32.210 --> 00:13:33.043
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

245
00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:37.630
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund </v>
<v Speaker 1>raises $11 billion loan.</v>

246
00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:39.970
<v Speaker 1>So what does this mean?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

247
00:13:39.971 --> 00:13:41.290
<v Speaker 1>two things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

248
00:13:41.291 --> 00:13:45.010
<v Speaker 1>the Saudi royal family now has a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>more breathing space for that.</v>

249
00:13:45.011 --> 00:13:45.844
<v Speaker 1>Aramco IPO,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company is now profitable enough </v>

250
00:13:48.010 --> 00:13:50.320
<v Speaker 1>that they can wait before going to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>stock market.</v>

251
00:13:50.321 --> 00:13:52.690
<v Speaker 1>So I'll lazy prints,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he doesn't need to worry about it.</v>

252
00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:53.553
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they could keep the oil barrel at 80 </v>

253
00:13:55.181 --> 00:13:56.014
<v Speaker 1>US dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be way easier to hit that </v>

254
00:13:58.181 --> 00:14:03.181
<v Speaker 1>initial valuation of $2 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And while that explains news like this,</v>

255
00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:07.503
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Crown Prince has ipo for oil giant</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Aramco will happen by early 2021 </v>

256
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:15.070
<v Speaker 1>meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two things we should cover.</v>

257
00:14:15.130 --> 00:14:15.963
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Islamic Republic of Iran is at the </v>

258
00:14:17.471 --> 00:14:20.260
<v Speaker 1>edge of economic collapse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is leading to protests,</v>

259
00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:22.930
<v Speaker 1>social unrest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an authoritarian regime.</v>

260
00:14:22.931 --> 00:14:23.764
<v Speaker 1>That is having a very bad situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seconds we have the big question is the </v>

261
00:14:27.461 --> 00:14:30.610
<v Speaker 1>EU gonna comply with trump sanctions?</v>
<v Speaker 1>The debate,</v>

262
00:14:30.640 --> 00:14:32.410
<v Speaker 1>it really couldn't be hotter these days.</v>

263
00:14:34.930 --> 00:14:38.680
<v Speaker 1>You asked to protect firms from donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's sanctions against Iran.</v>

264
00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:39.873
<v Speaker 1>So now the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think we are at the beginning of </v>

265
00:14:42.221 --> 00:14:43.054
<v Speaker 1>the end of the ayatollah's regime?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the European Union will </v>

266
00:14:45.761 --> 00:14:48.330
<v Speaker 1>keep from buying oil from Iran?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
