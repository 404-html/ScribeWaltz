1
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.283
<v Speaker 1>Brazil is the country of the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it seems like we've been hearing </v>

2
00:00:10.691 --> 00:00:13.720
<v Speaker 1>that for a long time lately though.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We've had a lots of other countries,</v>

3
00:00:13.721 --> 00:00:14.554
<v Speaker 1>corruption scandals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic crisis this is going </v>

4
00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.370
<v Speaker 1>through or the street violence in cities</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Rio de Janeiro bond.</v>

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.670
<v Speaker 1>There is something even more important </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this country.</v>

6
00:00:21.671 --> 00:00:23.860
<v Speaker 1>Something that doesn't appear very much </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the media.</v>

7
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.713
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

8
00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Brazil is the most expensive country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of South America.</v>

9
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:32.700
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You heard that,</v>

10
00:00:32.701 --> 00:00:33.534
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you go shopping in a city like Sao </v>

11
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.023
<v Speaker 1>Paulo or Rio de Janeiro,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd better be ready to clean out your </v>

12
00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:42.330
<v Speaker 1>wallet because it will be as expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>as New York or London.</v>

13
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.070
<v Speaker 1>The Brazilians even have a name for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

14
00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:44.904
<v Speaker 1>They call it customer Brazil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the special charge you have to </v>

15
00:00:47.371 --> 00:00:50.940
<v Speaker 1>pay for living in the country of Samba.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's look at an example.</v>

16
00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:53.340
<v Speaker 1>The Big Mac Burger that you buy from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mcdonald's.</v>

17
00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.770
<v Speaker 1>If you've been subscribed to visual </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics for a long time,</v>

18
00:00:55.771 --> 00:00:56.604
<v Speaker 1>you already know that the economists use</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called the Big Mac index to </v>

19
00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.210
<v Speaker 1>measure the cost of living in a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>double in Switzerland.</v>

20
00:01:06.291 --> 00:01:08.180
<v Speaker 1>One of the wealthiest countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

21
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.210
<v Speaker 1>the big Mac costs a whopping six point </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven,</v>

22
00:01:11.211 --> 00:01:13.270
<v Speaker 1>$5.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then we have Peru,</v>

23
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.550
<v Speaker 1>a poorer country where the Burger and </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs $3 and twenty three cents.</v>

24
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.510
<v Speaker 1>Fair enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

25
00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.590
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Brazil,</v>

26
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.530
<v Speaker 1>the big Mac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs $5 and ten cents.</v>

27
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.100
<v Speaker 1>It's more expensive than in Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the UK or Canada,</v>

28
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.470
<v Speaker 1>according to the ex parte astound.com </v>
<v Speaker 1>website.</v>

29
00:01:27.471 --> 00:01:28.304
<v Speaker 1>Sao Paulo is the most expensive city in </v>
<v Speaker 1>South America with prices as high as </v>

30
00:01:32.031 --> 00:01:33.290
<v Speaker 1>Houston,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas,</v>

31
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.700
<v Speaker 1>Berlin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or Germany.</v>

32
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.400
<v Speaker 1>And now you might want to give them the </v>
<v Speaker 1>high cost of living.</v>

33
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.840
<v Speaker 1>How high a Brazilian salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all the wealthier save and Colombians.</v>

34
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.100
<v Speaker 1>Chileans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

35
00:01:47.101 --> 00:01:47.934
<v Speaker 1>absolutely not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average wage in Brazil is less than </v>

36
00:01:50.431 --> 00:01:51.264
<v Speaker 1>$600 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentinians and Chileans are actually </v>

37
00:01:53.701 --> 00:01:54.534
<v Speaker 1>better off in this regard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the real question here is why is </v>

38
00:01:56.951 --> 00:01:57.784
<v Speaker 1>Brazil so expensive?</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of the reasons why a middle income </v>

39
00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:03.220
<v Speaker 1>country has the prices of a wealthy one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:03.221 --> 00:02:05.890
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer this </v>
<v Speaker 1>question and believe me,</v>

41
00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:08.800
<v Speaker 1>there's also partly explains the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian crisis too.</v>

42
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.260
<v Speaker 1>So let's dive in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Isolated economy.</v>

43
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.320
<v Speaker 1>Many of you might think of Brazil as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country opens a free trade,</v>

44
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.101
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

45
00:02:17.101 --> 00:02:17.934
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many foreign companies like mastercard </v>

46
00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.680
<v Speaker 1>or Barclays have a strong presence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country.</v>

47
00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.633
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil has the highest tariffs in South </v>

48
00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.660
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what does this mean?</v>

49
00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:35.523
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>imagine we have a cell phone </v>

50
00:02:36.911 --> 00:02:37.744
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer in America or in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they wanted to sell on the Brazilian </v>

51
00:02:40.301 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since our product is made abroad,</v>

52
00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.593
<v Speaker 1>we must sell it with a special tax that </v>
<v Speaker 1>could reach up to 35 percent of its </v>

53
00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:48.850
<v Speaker 1>market price.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

54
00:02:48.851 --> 00:02:52.420
<v Speaker 1>this type of policy has a pretty big </v>
<v Speaker 1>impact on everyday life.</v>

55
00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:55.780
<v Speaker 2>Contento</v>

56
00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.270
<v Speaker 1>exits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian market due to high tariffs.</v>

57
00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.800
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Heard that right.</v>

58
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.300
<v Speaker 1>During those years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilians,</v>

59
00:03:01.301 --> 00:03:02.134
<v Speaker 1>he wanted to buy a we or an intended des</v>
<v Speaker 1>had to travel to Uruguay in order to </v>

60
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:07.240
<v Speaker 1>find one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

61
00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:10.090
<v Speaker 1>this was a great advantage for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nintendo's biggest rivals,</v>

62
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.360
<v Speaker 1>especially Microsoft and the Xbox,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know why?</v>

63
00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:14.343
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Microsoft has a factory in Brazil where </v>

64
00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:16.664
<v Speaker 1>the xbox one is made.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means they don't have to import it </v>

65
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:24.330
<v Speaker 1>and therefore it doesn't have those high</v>
<v Speaker 1>tariffs and yes,</v>

66
00:03:27.331 --> 00:03:28.164
<v Speaker 1>I know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>High tariffs are cool because they </v>

67
00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:33.780
<v Speaker 1>forced companies to build factories in </v>
<v Speaker 1>your country and employ your citizens.</v>

68
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.760
<v Speaker 1>think twice that when Microsoft opens </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Brazilian factory,</v>

70
00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:39.713
<v Speaker 1>they still need to import all the </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines and materials needed to </v>

71
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.580
<v Speaker 1>manufacture that xbox one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This can be plastic semiconductors,</v>

72
00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:47.423
<v Speaker 1>robots.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of these things are made somewhere </v>

73
00:03:49.141 --> 00:03:54.050
<v Speaker 1>else and if they are made somewhere </v>
<v Speaker 1>else,</v>

74
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.913
<v Speaker 1>they still have these special tariffs </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you can guess who pays for these </v>

75
00:03:58.131 --> 00:03:59.420
<v Speaker 1>extra costs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

76
00:03:59.421 --> 00:04:00.254
<v Speaker 1>it's the consumer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This explains why so many products </v>

77
00:04:02.421 --> 00:04:04.730
<v Speaker 1>manufactured in Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also expensive.</v>

78
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>Want an example?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take the Volkswagen Golf in Mexico City.</v>

79
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:10.250
<v Speaker 1>This car costs around 15,000 US dollars</v>

80
00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:16.350
<v Speaker 1>in Sao Paulo.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It costs 25,000 US dollars.</v>

81
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:17.243
<v Speaker 1>All of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite the fact that this specific </v>

82
00:04:18.901 --> 00:04:21.930
<v Speaker 1>model of automobile is many factored in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Sao Paulo,</v>

83
00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:25.200
<v Speaker 1>but wait a minute because this is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>the only thing that explains this.</v>

84
00:04:25.201 --> 00:04:26.034
<v Speaker 1>Customer Brazil or what the Brazilians </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to refer to this incredibly high </v>

85
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:29.544
<v Speaker 1>cost of living cousteau.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine someone doing soy </v>

86
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:38.020
<v Speaker 1>agriculture in the state of power in the</v>
<v Speaker 1>north of this country.</v>

87
00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.910
<v Speaker 1>If he wants to send this side is all </v>
<v Speaker 1>power,</v>

88
00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:42.190
<v Speaker 1>he must carry it on trucks through the </v>
<v Speaker 1>highway,</v>

89
00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.630
<v Speaker 1>be all one six,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>

90
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:47.290
<v Speaker 1>This highway has over a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers and a hundred of its on.</v>

91
00:04:47.291 --> 00:04:48.124
<v Speaker 1>Not even paved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A simple rainy day is enough to keep </v>

92
00:04:50.081 --> 00:04:53.560
<v Speaker 1>those trucks stuck in the mud,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is just one example.</v>

93
00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.010
<v Speaker 1>In fact in Brazil has some of the worst </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure in the world.</v>

94
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 1>Even India has better roads,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so to make a comparison,</v>

95
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 1>any xymogen American farmer sells $100 </v>
<v Speaker 1>in,</v>

96
00:05:05.831 --> 00:05:10.270
<v Speaker 1>so he has to spend $9 on transportation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same farmer in Brazil,</v>

97
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:13.460
<v Speaker 1>I'd have to pay $25 since they have no </v>
<v Speaker 1>good roads.</v>

98
00:05:13.461 --> 00:05:14.294
<v Speaker 1>Brazilians have to invest in expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>trucks that break down quickly and make </v>

99
00:05:17.691 --> 00:05:18.524
<v Speaker 1>the cost even more expensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course all of this means higher </v>

100
00:05:22.161 --> 00:05:25.010
<v Speaker 1>and higher prices for Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>customers.</v>

101
00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.570
<v Speaker 1>But now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

102
00:05:26.571 --> 00:05:30.170
<v Speaker 1>why is the Brazilian governments are </v>
<v Speaker 1>reluctant to pay for infrastructure?</v>

103
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.023
<v Speaker 1>But at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil has state of the art engineering </v>

104
00:05:32.661 --> 00:05:34.440
<v Speaker 1>companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies like the automatic.</v>

105
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.313
<v Speaker 2>It's great.</v>

106
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.890
<v Speaker 1>He happened to be someone watching from </v>
<v Speaker 1>a South American country.</v>

107
00:05:42.891 --> 00:05:43.724
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this name probably rings a bell for you </v>

108
00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.890
<v Speaker 1>or direct was the biggest engineering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and construction company in the region,</v>

109
00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.963
<v Speaker 1>and I do say was here because they had </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest corruption scandal in the </v>

110
00:05:53.271 --> 00:05:54.104
<v Speaker 1>history of the continent and as </v>
<v Speaker 1>naturally with the future of the firm </v>

111
00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:58.033
<v Speaker 1>isn't looking pretty dim.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But this story does explain well why </v>

112
00:06:01.521 --> 00:06:04.610
<v Speaker 1>Brazil has such poor infrastructure </v>
<v Speaker 1>because at the end of the day,</v>

113
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:07.880
<v Speaker 1>part of the money goes towards bribes </v>
<v Speaker 1>and corruption.</v>

114
00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.953
<v Speaker 1>But normally that's when the Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 1>government wanted to modernize their </v>

115
00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:13.160
<v Speaker 1>country world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What did they do?</v>

116
00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:16.350
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

117
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:17.383
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to host the Olympic Games </v>

118
00:06:18.681 --> 00:06:20.530
<v Speaker 1>and the FIFA World Cup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So today,</v>

119
00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.050
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian cities can congratulate </v>
<v Speaker 1>themselves for having the most beautiful</v>

120
00:06:24.051 --> 00:06:28.070
<v Speaker 1>sports arenas with high end technology </v>
<v Speaker 1>and luxurious decoration today,</v>

121
00:06:28.071 --> 00:06:29.690
<v Speaker 1>taking a walk in the center of Sao </v>
<v Speaker 1>Paolo,</v>

122
00:06:29.691 --> 00:06:33.820
<v Speaker 1>or it feels like being in a Scifi movie,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but outside of this metropolis,</v>

123
00:06:33.821 --> 00:06:34.654
<v Speaker 1>the railroads or abandons the highways </v>
<v Speaker 1>are unpaved and several neighborhoods </v>

124
00:06:37.941 --> 00:06:41.840
<v Speaker 1>don't have a single bus line that </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects them with the city center.</v>

125
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.270
<v Speaker 1>Woeful infrastructure costs the economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>as much as $48,</v>

126
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:50.290
<v Speaker 1>billion US dollars per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

127
00:06:50.291 --> 00:06:53.470
<v Speaker 1>of course this affects the prices for </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian consumers,</v>

128
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:57.340
<v Speaker 1>but also for worldwide consumers who </v>
<v Speaker 1>wants to buy and Brazilian goods.</v>

129
00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.203
<v Speaker 1>But that is something we're actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to address in a future video </v>

130
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:01.203
<v Speaker 1>because now the question really becomes </v>
<v Speaker 1>how can someone who makes $600 bucks a </v>

131
00:07:03.641 --> 00:07:08.140
<v Speaker 1>month spend 25 bucks on pizza as an </v>
<v Speaker 1>average restaurant in Sao Paolo?</v>

132
00:07:08.230 --> 00:07:10.270
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I am going to tell you how</v>

133
00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:14.270
<v Speaker 2>ready</v>

134
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:18.630
<v Speaker 1>the hallway for decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil had some of the highest inflation</v>

135
00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:21.090
<v Speaker 1>in the wells during the 19 eighties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>nineties,</v>

136
00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:24.630
<v Speaker 1>they had more than 6,000 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>inflation.</v>

137
00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:28.250
<v Speaker 1>This means if you had a bear as a Rio de</v>
<v Speaker 1>Janeiro bar in 1980,</v>

138
00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.093
<v Speaker 1>you would pay 100 femoral.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The terra was the Brazilian currency </v>

139
00:07:31.771 --> 00:07:33.000
<v Speaker 1>back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then one year later,</v>

140
00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:36.280
<v Speaker 1>that same beer would cost 600,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>arrows.</v>

141
00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:37.463
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hyperinflation created unique consumer </v>

142
00:07:39.901 --> 00:07:40.734
<v Speaker 1>behavior</v>

143
00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:44.910
<v Speaker 2>behavior</v>

144
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.040
<v Speaker 1>that was quite different from the rest </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the world in order to survive.</v>

145
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:48.893
<v Speaker 1>Resilience,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ships got used to selling with </v>

146
00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:53.010
<v Speaker 1>installments and it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is still a thing today.</v>

147
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.470
<v Speaker 1>If you go to any Brazilian shop,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that next to the prices said</v>

148
00:07:56.471 --> 00:07:59.400
<v Speaker 1>something like 10 x,</v>
<v Speaker 1>12 x or 20 x.</v>

149
00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.390
<v Speaker 1>This number means that you can pay for </v>
<v Speaker 1>this product on 10,</v>

150
00:08:02.490 --> 00:08:04.020
<v Speaker 1>12 or 20 installments.</v>

151
00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.600
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

152
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:12.760
<v Speaker 1>question many Brazilians ask themselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not whether this TV,</v>

153
00:08:12.761 --> 00:08:14.700
<v Speaker 1>your this suit is more or less </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive,</v>

154
00:08:14.820 --> 00:08:17.850
<v Speaker 1>but if they can pay for it during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>next two years,</v>

155
00:08:17.920 --> 00:08:20.820
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine when you buy </v>
<v Speaker 1>something in installments,</v>

156
00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:25.880
<v Speaker 1>it is far more extensive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the screen,</v>

157
00:08:26.901 --> 00:08:30.260
<v Speaker 1>we're showing you a smartphone on a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian ecommerce website.</v>

158
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 1>If you bought a ones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it costs 632 you race,</v>

159
00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:35.420
<v Speaker 1>which is equivalent to $202 at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

160
00:08:35.421 --> 00:08:38.330
<v Speaker 1>We need this video nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you buy it with installments,</v>

161
00:08:38.331 --> 00:08:42.860
<v Speaker 1>it costs 217 US dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a seven percent increase.</v>

162
00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:43.753
<v Speaker 1>So as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your average Brazilian is in debt all </v>

163
00:08:46.161 --> 00:08:46.994
<v Speaker 1>the time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ninety percent of Brazilians in </v>

164
00:08:50.891 --> 00:08:51.630
<v Speaker 1>installment</v>

165
00:08:51.630 --> 00:08:54.210
<v Speaker 2>debt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but</v>

166
00:08:54.210 --> 00:08:55.980
<v Speaker 1>wait just a minute because is not the</v>

167
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:57.410
<v Speaker 2>worst of it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the last year,</v>

168
00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:58.283
<v Speaker 2>something has happened in Brazil that is</v>
<v Speaker 2>done to custody Brazil into a real nice </v>

169
00:09:01.381 --> 00:09:04.650
<v Speaker 2>matt ready</v>

170
00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:05.483
<v Speaker 1>card.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How at the beginning of the two </v>

171
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:07.620
<v Speaker 1>thousands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

172
00:09:07.621 --> 00:09:09.870
<v Speaker 1>it was the perfect market for foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>banks.</v>

173
00:09:09.930 --> 00:09:10.763
<v Speaker 1>Big Financial firms like Santander or </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit suisse started investing in the </v>

174
00:09:14.071 --> 00:09:17.340
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't forget,</v>

175
00:09:17.341 --> 00:09:20.580
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a $200 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>person country that was on the rise here</v>

176
00:09:20.730 --> 00:09:21.563
<v Speaker 1>where prices were high and people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>used to paying for things in </v>

177
00:09:23.461 --> 00:09:25.470
<v Speaker 1>installments and other words.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil.</v>

178
00:09:25.471 --> 00:09:26.304
<v Speaker 1>It was a paradise for selling credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>cards since 2005 Brazil's credit card </v>

179
00:09:30.841 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 1>market has grown at a 20 percent plus </v>
<v Speaker 1>rate and yeah.</v>

180
00:09:38.030 --> 00:09:38.863
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

181
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:40.653
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2012 Brazilians had an average of two </v>

182
00:09:42.131 --> 00:09:45.820
<v Speaker 1>credit cards per person and they really </v>
<v Speaker 1>knew how to use them.</v>

183
00:09:46.030 --> 00:09:46.863
<v Speaker 1>Brazil was the country with the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit payments across all of South </v>

184
00:09:49.450 --> 00:09:50.500
<v Speaker 1>America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

185
00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.393
<v Speaker 1>that happiness,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it didn't last very super default and </v>

186
00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:00.760
<v Speaker 1>credit cards has reached 27 percent in </v>
<v Speaker 1>April 2012 in the very same year,</v>

187
00:10:00.790 --> 00:10:01.623
<v Speaker 1>2012,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the alarm started to sound in all those </v>

188
00:10:03.491 --> 00:10:04.324
<v Speaker 1>Brazilian banks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country was in the middle of a </v>

189
00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.000
<v Speaker 1>crisis with rising unemployment and </v>
<v Speaker 1>declining salaries and that made it hard</v>

190
00:10:10.001 --> 00:10:12.190
<v Speaker 1>for Brazilians.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do pay back that debt.</v>

191
00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:15.050
<v Speaker 1>So what happens when a bank is afraid of</v>
<v Speaker 1>getting into falses?</v>

192
00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as the interest,</v>

193
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:17.673
<v Speaker 2>great</v>

194
00:10:19.050 --> 00:10:24.050
<v Speaker 1>residents have to pay 414 percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>interest on their credit cards.</v>

195
00:10:24.430 --> 00:10:26.710
<v Speaker 1>So you mentioned you use your credit </v>
<v Speaker 1>card to buy a TV screen.</v>

196
00:10:26.711 --> 00:10:30.220
<v Speaker 1>The costs you a thousand US dollars,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you pay for it in 12 installments.</v>

197
00:10:30.340 --> 00:10:31.390
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day,</v>

198
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.310
<v Speaker 1>counting the interest rates and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>credit card,</v>

199
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.930
<v Speaker 1>the TV costs around 5,000 US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Pretty impressive,</v>

200
00:10:37.931 --> 00:10:38.764
<v Speaker 1>isn't it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't forget that the average wage </v>

201
00:10:39.971 --> 00:10:42.940
<v Speaker 1>in present is less than $600 a month.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

202
00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:45.640
<v Speaker 1>no matter the antipoverty measures taken</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the government,</v>

203
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:48.940
<v Speaker 1>most Brazilians struggling to survive </v>
<v Speaker 1>and west of all,</v>

204
00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:50.290
<v Speaker 1>since they call it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>saves money,</v>

205
00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.020
<v Speaker 1>losing a job and be a real tragedy for </v>
<v Speaker 1>many,</v>

206
00:10:55.540 --> 00:10:56.000
<v Speaker 2>almost</v>

207
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.660
<v Speaker 1>relation in Rio de Janeiro increases 150</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent in three years.</v>

208
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:00.553
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

209
00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:05.010
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is the question now,</v>

210
00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:05.873
<v Speaker 1>can Brazil get over the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who could possibly reformed this </v>

211
00:11:08.941 --> 00:11:09.631
<v Speaker 1>country?</v>
