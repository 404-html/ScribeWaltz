00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.923
<v Speaker 1>When thinking about taxes you might </v>
<v Speaker 1>think of country music Westons George </v>

2
00:00:04.231 --> 00:00:07.540
<v Speaker 1>Bush and a certain ranger will be </v>
<v Speaker 1>aimless.</v>

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.940
<v Speaker 1>However Texas is far more than these </v>
<v Speaker 1>overused cliches.</v>

4
00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.233
<v Speaker 1>Frank.</v>

5
00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:16.603
<v Speaker 2>In the last few years Texas has become </v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the most important drivers of </v>

6
00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.460
<v Speaker 2>higher U.S.</v>
<v Speaker 2>economy.</v>

7
00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.030
<v Speaker 2>And Texas is what we're going to be </v>
<v Speaker 2>telling you about in this video.</v>

8
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.463
<v Speaker 1>With over 270000 square miles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas is 3 times the size of the entire </v>

9
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.033
<v Speaker 1>United Kingdom.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In addition to that Texas is one of the </v>

10
00:00:43.741 --> 00:00:44.574
<v Speaker 1>largest states in the U.S.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact it is the second largest behind </v>

11
00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:48.433
<v Speaker 1>only Alaska.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Texas is located in the southern region </v>

12
00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:54.060
<v Speaker 1>of the United States known as the Sun </v>
<v Speaker 1>Belt.</v>

13
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.920
<v Speaker 1>It has a coastline along the Gulf of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico and also borders Mexico itself.</v>

14
00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.990
<v Speaker 1>This border with Mexico stretches for </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 1200 and 50 miles.</v>

15
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.363
<v Speaker 1>The Lone Star State may strike some as a</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostile wasteland but there is far more </v>

16
00:01:08.581 --> 00:01:11.340
<v Speaker 1>to it than that there are in fact four </v>
<v Speaker 1>seasons.</v>

17
00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.623
<v Speaker 3>The drought the flood the blizzard and </v>
<v Speaker 3>the tornado season this harsh climate </v>

18
00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:18.804
<v Speaker 3>has not prevented Texas from becoming </v>
<v Speaker 3>the 12th largest economy in the entire </v>

19
00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:24.564
<v Speaker 3>world.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It is also the fastest growing state in </v>

20
00:01:27.181 --> 00:01:29.400
<v Speaker 3>the United States by population numbers.</v>

21
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:30.353
<v Speaker 4>It creates the most jobs in the United </v>
<v Speaker 4>States and is responsible for the most </v>

22
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:34.523
<v Speaker 4>exports.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Since 2000 the population of Texas has </v>

23
00:01:38.841 --> 00:01:42.410
<v Speaker 4>increased by six million people which is</v>
<v Speaker 4>more than any other states.</v>

24
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:43.393
<v Speaker 4>An additional one point five million </v>
<v Speaker 4>Americans have moved to Texas in search </v>

25
00:01:47.391 --> 00:01:48.224
<v Speaker 4>of a better future for many.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Texas has become a place where you go </v>

26
00:01:51.051 --> 00:01:52.830
<v Speaker 4>when you're looking for a fresh start.</v>

27
00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>It's a popular place for people to go if</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've lost their job in their states.</v>

28
00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.333
<v Speaker 1>According to data published by the U.S.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Census five out of eight of the cities </v>

29
00:02:08.671 --> 00:02:13.671
<v Speaker 1>that grew the most in the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 were in Texas.</v>

30
00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.153
<v Speaker 2>Additionally 40 percent of the 27 </v>
<v Speaker 2>million people who live in Texas are of </v>

31
00:02:27.821 --> 00:02:31.600
<v Speaker 2>Latino heritage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore it is estimated that by 2020</v>

32
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.300
<v Speaker 2>Hispanics will be the majority in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

33
00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.620
<v Speaker 2>This will make Texas the world's second </v>
<v Speaker 2>largest economic Hispanic power.</v>

34
00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.513
<v Speaker 2>This is only behind California which </v>
<v Speaker 2>already has a majority Hispanic </v>

35
00:02:42.431 --> 00:02:43.264
<v Speaker 2>population.</v>

36
00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:44.343
<v Speaker 5>Also the Republican candidate for </v>
<v Speaker 5>governor Greg Abbott has released his </v>

37
00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:51.460
<v Speaker 5>first television ad and it's in Spanish </v>
<v Speaker 5>and the 21st century.</v>

38
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.413
<v Speaker 2>Texas has led job creation in the United</v>
<v Speaker 2>States in the last 16 years employment </v>

39
00:02:57.191 --> 00:03:00.910
<v Speaker 2>in Texas has tripled the national </v>
<v Speaker 2>average in the same period.</v>

40
00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:01.803
<v Speaker 2>Texas has created a million more jobs </v>
<v Speaker 2>than California a state which has 12 </v>

41
00:03:05.381 --> 00:03:06.214
<v Speaker 2>million more people.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since the beginning of the financial </v>

42
00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:13.060
<v Speaker 2>crisis in December 2007 Texas which </v>
<v Speaker 2>represents about 8 percent of the U.S.</v>

43
00:03:13.061 --> 00:03:13.894
<v Speaker 2>population has been responsible for one </v>
<v Speaker 2>out of every four jobs created in the </v>

44
00:03:18.611 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So it's no surprise that unemployment is</v>

45
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:22.804
<v Speaker 2>lower than the U.S.</v>
<v Speaker 2>average and has been that way for the </v>

46
00:03:24.641 --> 00:03:25.474
<v Speaker 2>last ten years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also in the same period Texas's GDP has </v>

47
00:03:28.331 --> 00:03:29.164
<v Speaker 2>enjoyed a 60 percent growth while the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of the country has had to settle </v>

48
00:03:31.931 --> 00:03:32.764
<v Speaker 2>for 35 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Also as I was saying earlier it is the </v>

49
00:03:35.141 --> 00:03:35.974
<v Speaker 2>states that exports the most and 52 of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Fortune 500 largest companies are </v>

50
00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:41.283
<v Speaker 2>based in Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Having said all of this is no surprise </v>

51
00:03:48.081 --> 00:03:52.710
<v Speaker 2>that people consider Texas to be the </v>
<v Speaker 2>true economic driver of the U.S..</v>

52
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.943
<v Speaker 1>Now it is true that Texas has suffered </v>
<v Speaker 1>because of the fall in oil prices but </v>

53
00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:05.030
<v Speaker 1>many people believe that due to its </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasingly diversified economy it will</v>

54
00:04:05.031 --> 00:04:05.864
<v Speaker 1>still lead the way in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you might be asking now what exactly </v>

55
00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:15.460
<v Speaker 1>is so special about Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Town planning regulations.</v>

56
00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.303
<v Speaker 1>For middle and low income workers the </v>
<v Speaker 1>best part of Texas is the price of </v>

57
00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:23.234
<v Speaker 1>housing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These workers have access to big and </v>

58
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:26.503
<v Speaker 1>affordable homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This happens because regulation in the </v>

59
00:04:28.941 --> 00:04:29.774
<v Speaker 1>state is very flexible and it means that</v>
<v Speaker 1>homes can be built but not much more </v>

60
00:04:32.661 --> 00:04:35.440
<v Speaker 1>than the cost of the labor and net </v>
<v Speaker 1>component parts.</v>

61
00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Between 2001 and 2008 Harris County </v>
<v Speaker 1>which includes Houston authorized the </v>

62
00:04:40.671 --> 00:04:41.504
<v Speaker 1>building of 200000 homes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is compared to just 16000 in Santa </v>

63
00:04:45.951 --> 00:04:49.490
<v Speaker 1>Clarita in California which by the way </v>
<v Speaker 1>includes Silicon Valley.</v>

64
00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.560
<v Speaker 1>A new houses being built every five </v>
<v Speaker 1>acres in Texas.</v>

65
00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.580
<v Speaker 1>This is compared to one being build </v>
<v Speaker 1>every 50 in California.</v>

66
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:04.773
<v Speaker 1>This means that even if you make less </v>
<v Speaker 1>money in Texas you'll probably be able </v>

67
00:05:07.601 --> 00:05:10.450
<v Speaker 1>to afford a better home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you live in that state.</v>

68
00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:13.443
<v Speaker 1>University.</v>

69
00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:19.570
<v Speaker 2>Texas has been able to develop one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the best university systems in the world</v>

70
00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.613
<v Speaker 2>even though it only has a population of </v>
<v Speaker 2>27 million people four of the world's </v>

71
00:05:24.671 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 2>top 100 universities all located in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>state.</v>

72
00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:29.463
<v Speaker 2>For some perspective on Nasik country </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Spain which has a far larger </v>

73
00:05:32.141 --> 00:05:35.320
<v Speaker 2>population it has no universities in the</v>
<v Speaker 2>top 100.</v>

74
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.423
<v Speaker 2>The education system in Texas not only </v>
<v Speaker 2>creates high quality professionals but </v>

75
00:05:39.941 --> 00:05:43.000
<v Speaker 2>also attracts investments from a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>companies.</v>

76
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.260
<v Speaker 2>Texas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Regulations.</v>

77
00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.313
<v Speaker 2>On them all leaving.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas is a state where salaries provide </v>

78
00:05:52.691 --> 00:05:56.980
<v Speaker 2>generally high in value because the cost</v>
<v Speaker 2>of many things in Texas is lower than in</v>

79
00:05:56.981 --> 00:05:57.814
<v Speaker 2>other states.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People also have more money in their </v>

80
00:05:59.411 --> 00:06:03.760
<v Speaker 2>parties because of the lower housing </v>
<v Speaker 2>prices and the lower taxes in the state.</v>

81
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.380
<v Speaker 2>The taxes are lower because Texas is one</v>
<v Speaker 2>of only seven states that have new state</v>

82
00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.303
<v Speaker 2>level income tax as a reference point.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The average family living in Texas </v>

83
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.013
<v Speaker 2>compared to New York will save three </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousand five hundred dollars per year </v>

84
00:06:17.651 --> 00:06:20.710
<v Speaker 2>in taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All Things Considered Texas is the fifth</v>

85
00:06:20.711 --> 00:06:23.110
<v Speaker 2>best state for getting the most from </v>
<v Speaker 2>your salary.</v>

86
00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.100
<v Speaker 2>Besides this Texas is considered one of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the states with the most freedom.</v>

87
00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.890
<v Speaker 2>It is ranked sic recording to the Fraser</v>
<v Speaker 2>Institute.</v>

88
00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:30.843
<v Speaker 2>This means that it is significantly </v>
<v Speaker 2>easier to do business in Texas than </v>

89
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.740
<v Speaker 2>compared to some other states.</v>

90
00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.263
<v Speaker 2>Further there are fewer regulations </v>
<v Speaker 2>around jobs for example in Nevada </v>

91
00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:45.643
<v Speaker 2>Louisiana or Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The requirement to qualify as an </v>

92
00:06:47.901 --> 00:06:48.734
<v Speaker 2>interior designer is 2190 hours of work </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you also have to take a course in </v>

93
00:06:53.871 --> 00:06:54.704
<v Speaker 2>taxes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is no such requirement and anyone </v>

94
00:06:56.271 --> 00:06:58.580
<v Speaker 2>can go out and become an interior </v>
<v Speaker 2>designer.</v>

95
00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:02.210
<v Speaker 2>As a result of this many millennials </v>
<v Speaker 2>have been choosing Houston as a place to</v>

96
00:07:02.211 --> 00:07:03.044
<v Speaker 2>set up a business rather than more </v>
<v Speaker 2>traditional choices like New York City </v>

97
00:07:06.021 --> 00:07:06.854
<v Speaker 2>or Boston.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many Americans are starting to think </v>

98
00:07:08.451 --> 00:07:11.990
<v Speaker 2>that other states could start to emulate</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas in some ways.</v>

99
00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.130
<v Speaker 2>Not only are there the tangible benefits</v>
<v Speaker 2>of running a state in the way Texas does</v>

100
00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:18.950
<v Speaker 2>but there are also several cultural </v>
<v Speaker 2>benefits.</v>

101
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.933
<v Speaker 2>Texas's economic boom has attracted a </v>
<v Speaker 2>great deal of cultural and ethnic </v>

102
00:07:23.601 --> 00:07:24.434
<v Speaker 2>diversity contributing to cities like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Austin becoming a great place for </v>

103
00:07:27.351 --> 00:07:28.184
<v Speaker 2>musicians and other types of artist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Texas can teach us that it is possible </v>

104
00:07:31.281 --> 00:07:32.114
<v Speaker 2>to fight the negative effects of </v>
<v Speaker 2>globalization as well as the automation </v>

105
00:07:35.271 --> 00:07:36.104
<v Speaker 2>of jobs by machines and they haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>done this by protecting their companies </v>

106
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:40.064
<v Speaker 2>from foreign competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They've done it by reducing the </v>

107
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 2>obstacles that companies and individuals</v>
<v Speaker 2>face in the state.</v>

108
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.263
<v Speaker 6>Every week businesses lead Californians </v>
<v Speaker 6>to escape high taxes and strangling </v>

109
00:07:51.621 --> 00:07:56.090
<v Speaker 6>regulations.</v>
<v Speaker 6>They come to Texas because we keep taxes</v>

110
00:07:56.091 --> 00:07:56.840
<v Speaker 6>low.</v>

111
00:07:56.840 --> 00:07:57.673
<v Speaker 2>So this is just our opinion on taxes </v>
<v Speaker 2>here a visual politic and we would love </v>

112
00:08:00.621 --> 00:08:01.454
<v Speaker 2>to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you use the comments below to let us </v>

113
00:08:03.801 --> 00:08:04.580
<v Speaker 2>know your opinion.</v>

114
00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:05.413
<v Speaker 4>Do you think that more states will stop </v>
