1
00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.700
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.580
<v Speaker 2>Located between the Pacific Ocean and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Caribbean Sea.</v>

3
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.443
<v Speaker 2>We could say Columbia is something like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the entry and exit door of South </v>

4
00:00:16.051 --> 00:00:17.760
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You know what?</v>

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.040
<v Speaker 2>Well this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is Columbia,</v>

6
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.920
<v Speaker 2>the long and it's cheerful beaches of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Santa Marta.</v>

7
00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.953
<v Speaker 2>The lower he red desert,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the inaccessible the teeth.capital of </v>

8
00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:31.780
<v Speaker 2>the leafy Colombian Amazon rain forest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then there are the islands of San Andres</v>

9
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:32.740
<v Speaker 2>and providence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

10
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.623
<v Speaker 2>the coffee bells of Quinn Dio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>cal drows and raise Eraldo and then </v>

11
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:39.970
<v Speaker 2>there are of course the vibrant cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Midean Kelly or baron Quia,</v>

12
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:42.973
<v Speaker 2>and we can't forget about the historical</v>
<v Speaker 2>and proud Carter he know or the Frantic </v>

13
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:46.520
<v Speaker 2>Bogus,</v>

14
00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.353
<v Speaker 1>Huh?</v>

15
00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.070
<v Speaker 2>Very good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll be in the great capital city of the</v>

16
00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:50.904
<v Speaker 2>country that dear viewers with its </v>
<v Speaker 2>candelaria and it's incredible museums </v>

17
00:00:53.971 --> 00:00:57.210
<v Speaker 2>of Golden Arch.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll leave you absolutely speechless.</v>

18
00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.073
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We can't really be surprised that more </v>

19
00:00:58.891 --> 00:01:03.891
<v Speaker 2>and more travel companies are making </v>
<v Speaker 2>Columbia a 100% must visit destination.</v>

20
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.520
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you might've guessed this video,</v>

21
00:01:05.521 --> 00:01:08.190
<v Speaker 2>it's not going to be about tourism in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombia.</v>

22
00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.083
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's politics that we do here at visual </v>

23
00:01:11.071 --> 00:01:13.010
<v Speaker 2>politic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean it's right there in the name.</v>

24
00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.283
<v Speaker 3>May,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2018 Columbia will have its next </v>

25
00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:20.433
<v Speaker 3>presidential election and by August 7th </v>
<v Speaker 3>whoever wind will have begun his new </v>

26
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:26.020
<v Speaker 3>job.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Juan Manuel Santos,</v>

27
00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.190
<v Speaker 3>the current president cannot run again </v>
<v Speaker 3>as he has reached his two term limit.</v>

28
00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.290
<v Speaker 2>Santos is tying is coming to an end with</v>
<v Speaker 2>this video.</v>

29
00:01:34.291 --> 00:01:38.190
<v Speaker 2>We want to take a look ahead and to find</v>
<v Speaker 2>out what kind of Columbia he is going to</v>

30
00:01:38.191 --> 00:01:39.024
<v Speaker 2>leave to his successor.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're going to have a look at the great </v>

31
00:01:40.771 --> 00:01:42.750
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

32
00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.593
<v Speaker 2>there's the not so great.</v>

33
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.193
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

34
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.530
<v Speaker 3>Days.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Columbia,</v>

35
00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:49.563
<v Speaker 2>a gambling man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a great poker player and part of one of </v>

36
00:01:51.201 --> 00:01:53.690
<v Speaker 2>the most influential families in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombia.</v>

37
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.940
<v Speaker 2>This is Juan Manuel Santos.</v>

38
00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.703
<v Speaker 3>Even his great uncle at the water though</v>
<v Speaker 3>Santos was President of Columbia in the </v>

39
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.710
<v Speaker 3>late thirties his family also owned a </v>
<v Speaker 3>temple,</v>

40
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.400
<v Speaker 3>the most influential newspaper in the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country.</v>

41
00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.690
<v Speaker 2>It's the very same.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Juan Manuel Santos was for a long time.</v>

42
00:02:11.691 --> 00:02:14.570
<v Speaker 2>Deputy director ans a colonist apps,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the newspaper.</v>

43
00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.050
<v Speaker 2>What do we are trying to say is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>this family,</v>

44
00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.210
<v Speaker 2>they've never lacked influence money or </v>
<v Speaker 2>power.</v>

45
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:25.210
<v Speaker 1>Sorry,</v>

46
00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:26.043
<v Speaker 2>off to two times the 7th of August,</v>
<v Speaker 2>2017 marks the end of his time as </v>

47
00:02:29.831 --> 00:02:31.300
<v Speaker 2>president.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And to be honest,</v>

48
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.360
<v Speaker 2>his level of popularity,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much shot rock in Boston.</v>

49
00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:36.273
<v Speaker 2>This is even after winning the Nobel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Peace Prize due to the deal that he got </v>

50
00:02:39.341 --> 00:02:40.174
<v Speaker 2>with FARC.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The latest poll numbers when we're </v>

51
00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.273
<v Speaker 2>making this video showed that 65 to 75% </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Columbian people disapprove of his </v>

52
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.520
<v Speaker 2>governance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question now is,</v>

53
00:02:48.521 --> 00:02:49.354
<v Speaker 2>how does the Nobel prize winning leader </v>
<v Speaker 2>have such strong disapproval ratings </v>

54
00:02:53.201 --> 00:02:54.034
<v Speaker 2>from his own?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perhaps it has to do with this broken </v>

55
00:02:59.531 --> 00:03:00.100
<v Speaker 2>promise about</v>

56
00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.140
<v Speaker 3>the peace deal with foc.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Remember,</v>

57
00:03:02.141 --> 00:03:05.710
<v Speaker 3>he assured them that it was going to be </v>
<v Speaker 3>the Colombian people and no one else.</v>

58
00:03:05.711 --> 00:03:09.520
<v Speaker 3>You were going to have the last word on </v>
<v Speaker 3>the deal and well,</v>

59
00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:12.580
<v Speaker 3>let's just say that Santos forgot all </v>
<v Speaker 3>about that.</v>

60
00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.820
<v Speaker 3>Columbia referendum voters reject peace,</v>
<v Speaker 3>deal with bark,</v>

61
00:03:16.821 --> 00:03:18.260
<v Speaker 3>gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Colombia,</v>

62
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.540
<v Speaker 3>the FARC sign,</v>
<v Speaker 3>new peace deal.</v>

63
00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.610
<v Speaker 3>This time skipping voters</v>

64
00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.000
<v Speaker 2>bosses.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Apart from all of this.</v>

65
00:03:24.001 --> 00:03:27.420
<v Speaker 2>If there is really something that can </v>
<v Speaker 2>make an assumption low ratings,</v>

66
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.790
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>while I won't have to be via economy.</v>

67
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:31.140
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During the last decade,</v>

68
00:03:31.141 --> 00:03:33.480
<v Speaker 2>this Pacific Kuma called Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

69
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:34.373
<v Speaker 2>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it used to have quite strong grief and </v>

70
00:03:35.581 --> 00:03:39.300
<v Speaker 2>it even became one of the most thriving </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Latin American countries.</v>

71
00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:42.150
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>lately things have been emailed a little</v>

72
00:03:42.151 --> 00:03:46.140
<v Speaker 2>bit difference that actually they've </v>
<v Speaker 2>been really quite a lot different.</v>

73
00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.880
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a look at this chart.</v>

74
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.810
<v Speaker 2>Columbia is facing a situation of slow </v>
<v Speaker 2>down,</v>

75
00:03:55.811 --> 00:03:59.170
<v Speaker 2>which is really much closer to what we'd</v>
<v Speaker 2>call stagnation.</v>

76
00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.033
<v Speaker 2>The latest growth figures show a year on</v>
<v Speaker 2>year increase of slightly above 1% and </v>

77
00:04:03.821 --> 00:04:07.840
<v Speaker 2>2017 forecasts don't seem to be that </v>
<v Speaker 2>much better at all</v>

78
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:14.330
<v Speaker 3>be as economic growth rate will be 1.5% </v>
<v Speaker 3>in 2017 according to bb va research.</v>

79
00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.410
<v Speaker 2>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is really not a good figure,</v>

80
00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.263
<v Speaker 2>especially if we consider that most of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the richest countries are growing at </v>

81
00:04:22.531 --> 00:04:24.210
<v Speaker 2>higher rates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The United States,</v>

82
00:04:24.211 --> 00:04:24.901
<v Speaker 2>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>

83
00:04:24.901 --> 00:04:25.590
<v Speaker 2>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>UK,</v>

84
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.500
<v Speaker 2>all of them will grow more than Columbia</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2017 as well.</v>

85
00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.650
<v Speaker 2>It's kind of supposed to be that when </v>
<v Speaker 2>you're a poorer country you grow more.</v>

86
00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:38.310
<v Speaker 2>This is because of something that is </v>
<v Speaker 2>called economic convergence.</v>

87
00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:39.173
<v Speaker 2>So well now the question has to become </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's going on in Colombia and he </v>

88
00:04:42.331 --> 00:04:43.164
<v Speaker 2>blamed the situation on the fall of oil </v>
<v Speaker 2>and commodity prices and you know in a </v>

89
00:04:47.251 --> 00:04:48.084
<v Speaker 2>way this is sort of rice,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there are some nuances that we do </v>

90
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:53.920
<v Speaker 2>need to consider.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

91
00:04:53.921 --> 00:04:54.754
<v Speaker 2>it is true that it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its climax in 2013 oil did represent </v>

92
00:04:57.581 --> 00:05:00.310
<v Speaker 2>more than 50% of all the country's </v>
<v Speaker 2>exports.</v>

93
00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.203
<v Speaker 2>More than 30% of all foreign direct </v>
<v Speaker 2>investments has more than 20% of public </v>

94
00:05:05.321 --> 00:05:06.154
<v Speaker 2>reserve.</v>

95
00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.330
<v Speaker 1>But it's</v>

96
00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.390
<v Speaker 2>also true that for many years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to the high oil prices,</v>

97
00:05:11.391 --> 00:05:12.224
<v Speaker 2>the governance of Columbia has had more </v>
<v Speaker 2>resources than it's ever happened </v>

98
00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:15.754
<v Speaker 2>before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Resources that could have been used to </v>

99
00:05:17.241 --> 00:05:18.074
<v Speaker 2>boost a productive and competitive </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy unrelated to those original </v>

100
00:05:21.591 --> 00:05:22.424
<v Speaker 2>commodities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And this is something if at the Santos </v>

101
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.350
<v Speaker 2>Administration seems to not really have </v>
<v Speaker 2>done,</v>

102
00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:29.570
<v Speaker 2>perhaps this is because they've been </v>
<v Speaker 2>dedicated.</v>

103
00:05:29.571 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Speaker 2>This is almost exclusively to that peace</v>
<v Speaker 2>deal with fuck.</v>

104
00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.273
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's now have a look at what are the </v>

105
00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:38.780
<v Speaker 2>main weaknesses of the Colombian </v>
<v Speaker 2>economy?</v>

106
00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:46.930
<v Speaker 2>Disastrous infrastructure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For years Columbia's been,</v>

107
00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:51.410
<v Speaker 2>I'll should we say it's almost a failed </v>
<v Speaker 2>state in many areas.</v>

108
00:05:51.470 --> 00:05:54.260
<v Speaker 2>These are areas that were controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 2>warlords,</v>

109
00:05:54.261 --> 00:05:57.890
<v Speaker 2>gorillas and militias and narchos.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of those things,</v>

110
00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.783
<v Speaker 2>so now imagine how difficult it would be</v>
<v Speaker 2>to manage such a country ans build </v>

111
00:06:01.911 --> 00:06:02.744
<v Speaker 2>complex infrastructure there.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But really the reality is that that's </v>

112
00:06:05.301 --> 00:06:05.920
<v Speaker 2>not the whole school,</v>

113
00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.753
<v Speaker 1>Laurie.</v>

114
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:11.143
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that infrastructure has </v>
<v Speaker 2>never been a major priority for any </v>

115
00:06:14.901 --> 00:06:17.330
<v Speaker 2>Colombian government and the results of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this,</v>

116
00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.270
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty obvious.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The infrastructure in Colombia,</v>

117
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:23.540
<v Speaker 2>it's really,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really bad today to describe Columbia is</v>

118
00:06:23.541 --> 00:06:26.030
<v Speaker 2>infrastructure that we can use.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Really any other word,</v>

119
00:06:26.031 --> 00:06:28.520
<v Speaker 2>the dreadful,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of their paved roads,</v>

120
00:06:28.521 --> 00:06:31.150
<v Speaker 2>they're in a state of total disrepair as</v>
<v Speaker 2>well.</v>

121
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.550
<v Speaker 2>Was the result of all of this and do you</v>
<v Speaker 2>pay close attention to this?</v>

122
00:06:34.640 --> 00:06:36.440
<v Speaker 2>Because while there's almost </v>
<v Speaker 2>unbelievable</v>

123
00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:37.833
<v Speaker 1>football</v>

124
00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.473
<v Speaker 2>container within the country is twice as</v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive as in Mexico or Bolivia and </v>

125
00:06:45.561 --> 00:06:49.430
<v Speaker 2>four times more expensive than in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Argentina Gla or,</v>

126
00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:50.613
<v Speaker 2>and in fact the situation is so </v>
<v Speaker 2>disastrous that free transport between </v>

127
00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.010
<v Speaker 2>the Colombian ports of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of interior around Bogota is three times</v>

128
00:06:58.011 --> 00:07:01.220
<v Speaker 2>more expensive than moving the same load</v>
<v Speaker 2>from a rotterdam,</v>

129
00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:02.203
<v Speaker 1>Frank Franklin.</v>

130
00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:06.010
<v Speaker 2>Interestingly,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are some reports that claimed that</v>

131
00:07:06.011 --> 00:07:06.844
<v Speaker 2>sending a container from Carta Haina is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a blue guitar costs three times more </v>

132
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:11.680
<v Speaker 2>than sending it to Shanghai.</v>

133
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:12.613
<v Speaker 1>Hi,</v>

134
00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.133
<v Speaker 2>so now you can probably imagine all of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the effects that this has on supply </v>

135
00:07:20.571 --> 00:07:21.404
<v Speaker 2>costs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>prices and the competitiveness of </v>

136
00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:27.530
<v Speaker 2>Colombian companies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to a recent OACD report,</v>

137
00:07:27.560 --> 00:07:28.393
<v Speaker 2>Columbia is the third world's most </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive country from which to export </v>

138
00:07:31.971 --> 00:07:32.804
<v Speaker 2>containers after Venezuela and Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's why Hahnemann well sent us </v>

139
00:07:36.771 --> 00:07:41.771
<v Speaker 2>decided in 2010 to make changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is top priority and it is true.</v>

140
00:07:41.901 --> 00:07:42.734
<v Speaker 2>That is government has just released the</v>
<v Speaker 2>biggest infrastructure plan in the </v>

141
00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:49.220
<v Speaker 2>history of Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>A private co-funded plan,</v>

142
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:53.060
<v Speaker 2>which under a concessionary system is </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually pretty attractive.</v>

143
00:07:56.100 --> 00:08:01.100
<v Speaker 4>Bye.</v>
<v Speaker 4>[inaudible] must which three study?</v>

144
00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:07.370
<v Speaker 4>Yes.</v>

145
00:08:07.370 --> 00:08:08.203
<v Speaker 2>This plan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it actually seems to be well designed </v>

146
00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:10.423
<v Speaker 2>bars after seven years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just a bit too late and it still </v>

147
00:08:13.671 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 2>comes with many problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that the honest during his two terms,</v>

148
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:17.354
<v Speaker 2>Santos achievements are really haven't </v>
<v Speaker 2>been as good as he promised that they </v>

149
00:08:20.391 --> 00:08:21.670
<v Speaker 2>were going to be.</v>

150
00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:27.380
<v Speaker 1>Your rocker C and taxes</v>

151
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.650
<v Speaker 2>both the World Economic Forum,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm the world's bank,</v>

152
00:08:31.651 --> 00:08:32.484
<v Speaker 2>confirmed the Columbia is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>countries with the highest taxes on </v>

153
00:08:35.331 --> 00:08:36.164
<v Speaker 2>companies in the wells,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is obviously something that </v>

154
00:08:38.901 --> 00:08:39.734
<v Speaker 2>doesn't help companies to grow and </v>
<v Speaker 2>develop according to the paying taxes </v>

155
00:08:42.981 --> 00:08:45.770
<v Speaker 2>reports that every year price waterhouse</v>
<v Speaker 2>coopers publishers,</v>

156
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:46.663
<v Speaker 2>the total of all taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the declan via and the company has to </v>

157
00:08:48.771 --> 00:08:53.020
<v Speaker 2>pay is 69.8% of their pre tax port.</v>

158
00:08:57.370 --> 00:09:02.080
<v Speaker 2>That's almost 70% which is significantly</v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than in countries like Germany,</v>

159
00:09:02.081 --> 00:09:03.520
<v Speaker 2>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United States.</v>

160
00:09:03.521 --> 00:09:05.470
<v Speaker 2>To be honest,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty insane.</v>

161
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:08.260
<v Speaker 2>I think that's not even mentioning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy,</v>

162
00:09:08.261 --> 00:09:11.680
<v Speaker 2>which has an almost equal level of pure </v>
<v Speaker 2>insanity.</v>

163
00:09:11.710 --> 00:09:12.543
<v Speaker 2>Once they were really gonna have to make</v>
<v Speaker 2>a video about the passion for </v>

164
00:09:14.021 --> 00:09:16.390
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The last in America seems to have a book</v>

165
00:09:16.391 --> 00:09:17.224
<v Speaker 2>because it would be really long.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're not going to touch on it in </v>

166
00:09:18.761 --> 00:09:21.520
<v Speaker 2>today's video.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just too huge of a topic.</v>

167
00:09:21.550 --> 00:09:24.330
<v Speaker 2>But what we can say is that on an </v>
<v Speaker 2>average day in Columbia,</v>

168
00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:27.370
<v Speaker 2>15 rules and three decrees are issued.</v>

169
00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.680
<v Speaker 1>Okay?</v>

170
00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:33.830
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>really every single day,</v>

171
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:34.963
<v Speaker 2>not just that,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but according to research conducted by </v>

172
00:09:36.231 --> 00:09:37.064
<v Speaker 2>the University of last banner,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 30% of the laws passed are </v>

173
00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:41.054
<v Speaker 2>useless.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tans just create costs for Colombian </v>

174
00:09:43.221 --> 00:09:44.054
<v Speaker 2>society.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so what is quantum mainwell Santos </v>

175
00:09:46.241 --> 00:09:48.400
<v Speaker 2>has done to solve all of these issues?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

176
00:09:48.410 --> 00:09:50.810
<v Speaker 2>he's done almost nothing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

177
00:09:50.811 --> 00:09:55.811
<v Speaker 2>he has made the situation even worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Persistence,</v>

178
00:09:58.990 --> 00:09:59.823
<v Speaker 2>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It is true that many aspects where they </v>

179
00:10:03.111 --> 00:10:05.530
<v Speaker 2>to do security are improving in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombia.</v>

180
00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:06.393
<v Speaker 2>The uptick in the tourism industry in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the country is pretty good evidence of </v>

181
00:10:08.981 --> 00:10:10.800
<v Speaker 2>bass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2016 fundings,</v>

182
00:10:10.810 --> 00:10:11.643
<v Speaker 2>million tourists visited the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is twice the number from 2010 and </v>

183
00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:19.090
<v Speaker 2>almost 10 times the number from 2000 </v>
<v Speaker 2>which is certainly not bad.</v>

184
00:10:19.120 --> 00:10:19.953
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>despite this in many areas of the </v>

185
00:10:21.551 --> 00:10:23.530
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the situation,</v>

186
00:10:23.590 --> 00:10:25.110
<v Speaker 2>it's not really improving.</v>

187
00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

188
00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:27.303
<v Speaker 2>Cording to the United Nations and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Colombian conflict analysis resource </v>

189
00:10:30.851 --> 00:10:31.684
<v Speaker 2>center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there is still violence in the most </v>

190
00:10:33.101 --> 00:10:33.934
<v Speaker 2>affected areas of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That is the FARC peace deal has not </v>

191
00:10:37.001 --> 00:10:39.880
<v Speaker 2>substantially improved the situation in </v>
<v Speaker 2>these areas.</v>

192
00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.213
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>kept on growing and cocaine refining is </v>

193
00:10:44.731 --> 00:10:47.910
<v Speaker 2>at its absolute highest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Me Just have a look at this chart,</v>

194
00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:52.573
<v Speaker 2>so well now you might be wondering how </v>
<v Speaker 2>is it possible that violence levels and </v>

195
00:10:55.731 --> 00:10:56.564
<v Speaker 2>the production of illicit substances has</v>
<v Speaker 2>not been reduced since the governments </v>

196
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:00.734
<v Speaker 2>deal with fuck?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well that's because responding to all </v>

197
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.060
<v Speaker 2>the marketing from the government's </v>
<v Speaker 2>Indwell,</v>

198
00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:04.903
<v Speaker 2>the violence by FARC was huge.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It actually represents it less than 10% </v>

199
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:09.643
<v Speaker 2>of the nation's total violence and more </v>
<v Speaker 2>over the areas that FARC have left have </v>

200
00:11:13.071 --> 00:11:16.640
<v Speaker 2>not been occupied by government </v>
<v Speaker 2>institutions but by other Naco ends,</v>

201
00:11:16.641 --> 00:11:17.474
<v Speaker 2>militia groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>some of them even having a mutual </v>

202
00:11:19.251 --> 00:11:22.130
<v Speaker 2>agreement with fog after all the </v>
<v Speaker 2>business,</v>

203
00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:22.993
<v Speaker 2>it's still very attractive.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the peace deal left and many things </v>

204
00:11:25.461 --> 00:11:26.294
<v Speaker 2>up in the APP and that's why these so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called peace dividends is not giving </v>

205
00:11:29.301 --> 00:11:31.490
<v Speaker 2>results as big as the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>promised.</v>

206
00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:32.353
<v Speaker 2>Now to be fair though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not everything has been totally bad </v>

207
00:11:34.491 --> 00:11:36.170
<v Speaker 2>under Santos,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his presidency,</v>

208
00:11:42.030 --> 00:11:47.030
<v Speaker 2>the best of the centers administration,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we have to admit that Juan Manuel Santos</v>

209
00:11:47.551 --> 00:11:48.384
<v Speaker 2>has achieved some pretty good things is </v>
<v Speaker 2>government actually brought Columbia to </v>

210
00:11:51.151 --> 00:11:54.520
<v Speaker 2>the Pacific alliance and this is another</v>
<v Speaker 2>thing going to talk about in an upcoming</v>

211
00:11:54.521 --> 00:11:56.410
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so do not forget to subscribe,</v>

212
00:11:56.411 --> 00:11:58.820
<v Speaker 2>hit that button below.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's foreign agenda.</v>

213
00:11:58.821 --> 00:12:01.210
<v Speaker 2>It has been a great strength of his </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

214
00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:04.510
<v Speaker 2>Columbia today is more open to the world</v>
<v Speaker 2>than it ever has been before,</v>

215
00:12:04.570 --> 00:12:05.403
<v Speaker 2>so that poverty has been reduced </v>
<v Speaker 2>considerably and the country has </v>

216
00:12:07.961 --> 00:12:09.910
<v Speaker 2>attracted lots of foreign investment.</v>

217
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:15.150
<v Speaker 1>Bye.</v>

218
00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.983
<v Speaker 2>Despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our impression here at visual politic </v>

219
00:12:17.521 --> 00:12:18.354
<v Speaker 2>isn't the arrival of a new government </v>
<v Speaker 2>can really be a positive turning point </v>

220
00:12:21.901 --> 00:12:24.540
<v Speaker 2>for Columbia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>When one manual Santos took office,</v>

221
00:12:24.570 --> 00:12:25.403
<v Speaker 2>the country seemed to be ready to tackle</v>
<v Speaker 2>a real process of transformation and </v>

222
00:12:28.891 --> 00:12:32.040
<v Speaker 2>their oil resources meds that they have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the ability to pay for us.</v>

223
00:12:32.070 --> 00:12:33.690
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this as of yes,</v>

224
00:12:33.691 --> 00:12:35.760
<v Speaker 2>it simply hasn't been achieved.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

225
00:12:35.761 --> 00:12:36.594
<v Speaker 2>it's kind of been the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Santos leaves a weak economic Columbia </v>

226
00:12:39.260 --> 00:12:42.510
<v Speaker 2>and many more future prospects than </v>
<v Speaker 2>current realities.</v>

227
00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:46.380
<v Speaker 2>So now we'd love to know your opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What do you think the future of Columbia</v>

228
00:12:46.381 --> 00:12:47.214
<v Speaker 2>will be?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How would you rate Santos as a </v>

229
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.320
<v Speaker 2>president?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
