1
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.343
<v Speaker 1>The US president.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump has an idea that he won't </v>

2
00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:16.380
<v Speaker 1>get off on how you determined link </v>
<v Speaker 1>continues to unleash his own world.</v>

3
00:00:16.381 --> 00:00:17.214
<v Speaker 1>War in this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>say commercial war against the rest of </v>

4
00:00:19.831 --> 00:00:20.664
<v Speaker 1>the world</v>

5
00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.730
<v Speaker 2>with a bank that everybody's stealing </v>
<v Speaker 2>from.</v>

6
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.633
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I respect China and I respect President </v>

7
00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:28.240
<v Speaker 2>Xi,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they've been killing us,</v>

8
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:29.273
<v Speaker 1>convinced that the United States is </v>
<v Speaker 1>being harmed and even Robert in its </v>

9
00:00:32.551 --> 00:00:34.290
<v Speaker 1>trade relations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent months,</v>

10
00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:35.124
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump has launched a tough </v>
<v Speaker 1>protectionist policy and as multiplied </v>

11
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:42.960
<v Speaker 1>tariffs from now on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars in imported products</v>

12
00:00:42.961 --> 00:00:43.794
<v Speaker 1>by the United States will have to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>the heavy tariffs that this </v>

13
00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:47.963
<v Speaker 1>administration has approved is </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially the economic he revolutions </v>

14
00:00:52.321 --> 00:00:56.130
<v Speaker 1>of by these American products or else </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not a true patriot.</v>

15
00:00:56.131 --> 00:01:01.131
<v Speaker 1>Welcome to the 1930s apparently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that during July,</v>

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.053
<v Speaker 1>2018 new tariffs are going to come into </v>
<v Speaker 1>effect of no less than 25% on products </v>

17
00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.140
<v Speaker 1>that the United States imports each year</v>
<v Speaker 1>from China,</v>

18
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.350
<v Speaker 1>which is worth about $50 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>By the way.</v>

19
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:15.000
<v Speaker 1>Additionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a few months ago,</v>

20
00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:18.660
<v Speaker 1>the White House place tariffs on Steel </v>
<v Speaker 1>Alemanian minium solar panels,</v>

21
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.580
<v Speaker 1>even washing machine imports sort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

22
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.870
<v Speaker 1>that is not all her at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has already sat plans on the table</v>

23
00:01:27.871 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>to implement many more tariffs really </v>
<v Speaker 1>soon.</v>

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.240
<v Speaker 1>The following will be set at the end of </v>
<v Speaker 1>August,</v>

25
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.560
<v Speaker 1>so check this out.</v>

26
00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.250
<v Speaker 1>US unveils additional tariffs on $200 </v>
<v Speaker 1>billion more in Chinese imports.</v>

27
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.100
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you ever played monopoly or risk?</v>

28
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could see that in the eyes of the </v>

29
00:01:46.291 --> 00:01:47.124
<v Speaker 1>American president and this whole thing </v>
<v Speaker 1>is kind of like a board game and as he </v>

30
00:01:51.301 --> 00:01:52.134
<v Speaker 1>is Donald Trump,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he's really not willing to lose hair </v>

31
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.850
<v Speaker 1>game.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Trump the game that game where you,</v>

32
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.530
<v Speaker 1>everything you ever wanted to own,</v>
<v Speaker 1>win or lose weight?</v>

33
00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.580
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think you'll like it.</v>

34
00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.160
<v Speaker 1>Now we move onto the question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is it really going to be that simple?</v>

35
00:02:08.161 --> 00:02:08.994
<v Speaker 1>Will the US presidents plans be </v>
<v Speaker 1>fulfilled and we'll via economy be </v>

36
00:02:11.881 --> 00:02:12.714
<v Speaker 1>strengthened by this type of policy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These aren't really the important </v>

37
00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:17.034
<v Speaker 1>questions here for now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We know the Donald Trump's speech is </v>

38
00:02:19.081 --> 00:02:22.740
<v Speaker 1>beginning to make many American </v>
<v Speaker 1>multinationals very nervous.</v>

39
00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.443
<v Speaker 1>I don't think this is going to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>resolved easily and I think these </v>

40
00:02:26.521 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>terrorists are going to hurt the u s </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

41
00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:29.663
<v Speaker 1>Rufus York,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sa President of the National Foreign </v>

42
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.263
<v Speaker 1>Trade Council,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which represents multinationals such as </v>

43
00:02:34.321 --> 00:02:35.154
<v Speaker 1>Coca Cola,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ford and Microsoft because fall from </v>

44
00:02:37.741 --> 00:02:38.574
<v Speaker 1>what was promised,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first victims are the American </v>

45
00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.490
<v Speaker 1>people themselves.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This an op.</v>

46
00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.770
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

47
00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.603
<v Speaker 1>broken dreams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Whitehouse repeatedly insists that </v>

48
00:02:55.011 --> 00:02:58.250
<v Speaker 1>this new policy aims to boost US </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

49
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.113
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before trump supporters begin to </v>

50
00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:01.084
<v Speaker 1>celebrate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just hold on a second because there are </v>

51
00:03:02.741 --> 00:03:05.650
<v Speaker 1>some things that the president is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking into account.</v>

52
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.773
<v Speaker 1>The first is that the vast majority of </v>
<v Speaker 1>tariffs are being applied on </v>

53
00:03:13.421 --> 00:03:14.254
<v Speaker 1>intermediate and capital goods.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is goods that company important to </v>

54
00:03:17.411 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 1>manufacture their products in the United</v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

55
00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.680
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of two things is happening.</v>

56
00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.820
<v Speaker 1>Either you pay the tariff or you start </v>
<v Speaker 1>buying in other markets,</v>

57
00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:31.240
<v Speaker 1>even assuming that it's possible in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States itself.</v>

58
00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.133
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this implies a higher cost of </v>

59
00:03:33.611 --> 00:03:34.444
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which evidently reduces US companies </v>

60
00:03:36.281 --> 00:03:37.114
<v Speaker 1>competitive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

61
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.410
<v Speaker 1>this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

62
00:03:40.411 --> 00:03:41.244
<v Speaker 1>the case of midcontinent nail that a </v>
<v Speaker 1>Missouri company that is the largest </v>

63
00:03:44.971 --> 00:03:45.804
<v Speaker 1>producer of nails in the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After trump approved tariffs on foreign </v>

64
00:03:49.561 --> 00:03:50.394
<v Speaker 1>steel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had to lay off 60 of their 500 </v>

65
00:03:52.531 --> 00:03:55.160
<v Speaker 1>employees and everything points to it </v>
<v Speaker 1>being forced.</v>

66
00:03:55.161 --> 00:03:58.740
<v Speaker 1>You close or transfer its entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>production to Mexico.</v>

67
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.763
<v Speaker 1>This is a company that works,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is a company that created employment </v>

68
00:04:03.811 --> 00:04:07.100
<v Speaker 1>that was the competitive in the free </v>
<v Speaker 1>market and that now do you have to,</v>

69
00:04:07.101 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 1>Washington's interference is falling </v>
<v Speaker 1>apart.</v>

70
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.030
<v Speaker 1>Then the second issue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which I'm sure won't surprise any of you</v>

71
00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:12.864
<v Speaker 1>peers that other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just going to simply accepts </v>

72
00:04:15.451 --> 00:04:16.850
<v Speaker 1>these tariffs and be like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ah,</v>

73
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.030
<v Speaker 1>it's cool.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In order to defend the core interests of</v>

74
00:04:21.031 --> 00:04:22.890
<v Speaker 1>the country and the interests of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

75
00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.910
<v Speaker 1>we are forced to retaliate statement of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,</v>

76
00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.733
<v Speaker 1>the European Union,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada and Mexico said that they will </v>

77
00:04:31.291 --> 00:04:32.124
<v Speaker 1>respond to new US tariffs on steel.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Linda aluminum with punitive measures </v>

78
00:04:36.091 --> 00:04:39.330
<v Speaker 1>targeting American products worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>billions of dollars.</v>

79
00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:40.253
<v Speaker 1>These other countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they going to react and they're </v>

80
00:04:42.271 --> 00:04:43.860
<v Speaker 1>basically going to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>guys,</v>

81
00:04:43.861 --> 00:04:45.380
<v Speaker 1>if you're going to set tariffs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>

82
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.413
<v Speaker 1>we're going to get on that too.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is something that just goes on </v>

83
00:04:48.331 --> 00:04:50.100
<v Speaker 1>and on and it really shouldn't be like </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

84
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.800
<v Speaker 1>but it's simply is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And really the consequences.</v>

85
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.510
<v Speaker 1>They don't take a long time to arrive.</v>

86
00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.863
<v Speaker 1>Holly Davidson,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the popular motorcycle manufacturer and </v>

87
00:05:03.791 --> 00:05:06.160
<v Speaker 1>one of the great icons in the U S and </v>
<v Speaker 1>check it out,</v>

88
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:06.994
<v Speaker 1>trump himself is actually a fan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has now announced that it will transfer </v>

89
00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:10.744
<v Speaker 1>parts of its production from its US </v>
<v Speaker 1>factories to new factories located in </v>

90
00:05:14.591 --> 00:05:15.424
<v Speaker 1>Europe.</v>

91
00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:17.860
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

92
00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.693
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when trump punish the European Union </v>

93
00:05:20.561 --> 00:05:21.394
<v Speaker 1>with tariffs on steel and Alan Minium,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they responded with more tariffs of </v>

94
00:05:24.701 --> 00:05:25.720
<v Speaker 1>their own.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

95
00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:28.930
<v Speaker 1>they increased the tariff on imports of </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycles,</v>

96
00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:33.931
<v Speaker 1>manufacturers in the United States from </v>
<v Speaker 1>6% to 31% so,</v>

97
00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:36.070
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does this all mean?</v>

98
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.911
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>on average,</v>

99
00:05:36.911 --> 00:05:40.740
<v Speaker 1>that means about $2,200</v>
<v Speaker 1>extra for every motorcycle.</v>

100
00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.713
<v Speaker 4>Some of it suggesting we should protect </v>
<v Speaker 4>American companies from foreign </v>

101
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:45.074
<v Speaker 4>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>I don't believe the American people are </v>

102
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:49.880
<v Speaker 4>afraid of competition.</v>
<v Speaker 4>That was made clear to me when I visited</v>

103
00:05:49.881 --> 00:05:50.714
<v Speaker 4>a Harley Davidson plant recently.</v>
<v Speaker 4>When you hear talk about a tough trade </v>

104
00:05:53.361 --> 00:05:54.194
<v Speaker 4>bill,</v>
<v Speaker 4>remember that being tough on trade and </v>

105
00:05:55.851 --> 00:05:58.070
<v Speaker 4>commerce,</v>
<v Speaker 4>the of the economy,</v>

106
00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:01.880
<v Speaker 5>one of the worst possible consequences </v>
<v Speaker 5>for the consumer and the American worker</v>

107
00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.250
<v Speaker 5>as I told them at the Harley Davidson </v>
<v Speaker 5>plant,</v>

108
00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:07.580
<v Speaker 5>it's time to gum.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The engine's not put on the brakes.</v>

109
00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:08.573
<v Speaker 1>This is a cost which evidently European </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle manufacturers such as BMW do </v>

110
00:06:12.511 --> 00:06:13.344
<v Speaker 1>not have to face and thanks to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>commercial agreements between the </v>

111
00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:19.950
<v Speaker 1>European Union and Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Neither will a Yamaha Kawasaki or Honda,</v>

112
00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:23.010
<v Speaker 1>which are by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Harley Davidson's main competitors.</v>

113
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.830
<v Speaker 5>This is further proof of the harm from </v>
<v Speaker 5>unilateral tariffs.</v>

114
00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:34.590
<v Speaker 5>The best way to help American workers,</v>
<v Speaker 5>consumers,</v>

115
00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.380
<v Speaker 5>and manufacturers is to open new markets</v>
<v Speaker 5>for them,</v>

116
00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.333
<v Speaker 5>not to raise barriers to our own market.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Ashley Strong a spokeswoman for House </v>

117
00:06:42.181 --> 00:06:43.350
<v Speaker 5>Speaker Paul Ryan,</v>

118
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:47.390
<v Speaker 1>and as you might imagine taking donald </v>
<v Speaker 1>trump's character ncu accounts.</v>

119
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:52.430
<v Speaker 1>This news made him angry and the even </v>
<v Speaker 1>threatens the company itself by twitter.</v>

120
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:53.973
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

121
00:06:54.930 --> 00:06:55.763
<v Speaker 5>leave Davidson.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It should never be built in another </v>

122
00:06:57.421 --> 00:06:58.380
<v Speaker 5>country.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Never.</v>

123
00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.140
<v Speaker 5>Their employees and customers are </v>
<v Speaker 5>already very angry at them.</v>

124
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.610
<v Speaker 5>If they move,</v>
<v Speaker 5>watch,</v>

125
00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.010
<v Speaker 5>it will be the beginning of the end.</v>
<v Speaker 5>They surrendered,</v>

126
00:07:05.070 --> 00:07:05.903
<v Speaker 5>they quit.</v>
<v Speaker 5>The aura will be gone and they will be </v>

127
00:07:07.501 --> 00:07:09.300
<v Speaker 5>taxed like never before.</v>

128
00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:10.273
<v Speaker 1>President of the threatening and </v>
<v Speaker 1>damaging the image of a large American </v>

129
00:07:12.381 --> 00:07:13.214
<v Speaker 1>companies simply for making business </v>
<v Speaker 1>decisions that could save them from </v>

130
00:07:15.651 --> 00:07:20.300
<v Speaker 1>massive losses is completely bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I suppose welcome to trump's America</v>

131
00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:21.193
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I suppose the question we could ask is </v>

132
00:07:22.461 --> 00:07:26.510
<v Speaker 1>does that motorcycle company really </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to transfer part of its production</v>

133
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:27.403
<v Speaker 1>over to Europe?</v>

134
00:07:35.570 --> 00:07:38.150
<v Speaker 5>Harley Davidson need to look to the </v>
<v Speaker 5>world.</v>

135
00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:39.320
<v Speaker 6>Yeah.</v>

136
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.153
<v Speaker 1>American companies have enough </v>
<v Speaker 1>challenges and problems to overcome as </v>

137
00:07:42.411 --> 00:07:46.970
<v Speaker 1>it is without us having to deal with </v>
<v Speaker 1>interference and nonsense from the White</v>

138
00:07:46.970 --> 00:07:47.390
<v Speaker 1>House.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

139
00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:48.223
<v Speaker 1>trump's trade war has had a strong </v>
<v Speaker 1>impacts on companies like Harley </v>

140
00:07:51.470 --> 00:07:52.303
<v Speaker 1>Davidson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their costs have increased due to steal </v>

141
00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.073
<v Speaker 1>and Alan minium tariffs since,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this means that the motorcycle </v>

142
00:07:55.971 --> 00:07:59.000
<v Speaker 1>company is spending 20 million more </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars every year,</v>

143
00:07:59.030 --> 00:07:59.863
<v Speaker 1>and if that wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American multinationals are starting to </v>

144
00:08:02.241 --> 00:08:04.560
<v Speaker 1>see the risk of them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Market's closing.</v>

145
00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:05.960
<v Speaker 6>Okay.</v>

146
00:08:05.960 --> 00:08:09.530
<v Speaker 5>Creasing international production to </v>
<v Speaker 5>alleviate the EU tariffs burden.</v>

147
00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.433
<v Speaker 5>He's not the company's preference,</v>
<v Speaker 5>but represents the only sustainable </v>

148
00:08:13.281 --> 00:08:17.270
<v Speaker 5>option to make.</v>
<v Speaker 5>It's motorcycles accessible to customers</v>

149
00:08:17.271 --> 00:08:20.270
<v Speaker 5>in the EU and maintain a viable business</v>
<v Speaker 5>in Europe.</v>

150
00:08:20.330 --> 00:08:24.320
<v Speaker 5>Europe is a critical market for Harley </v>
<v Speaker 5>Davidson statement by Harley Davidson</v>

151
00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:28.120
<v Speaker 1>because of this crisis has hard to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>motorcycle company at a time when it was</v>

152
00:08:28.121 --> 00:08:29.640
<v Speaker 1>already pretty weak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Checkout,</v>

153
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.690
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm its stock price has evolved over the</v>

154
00:08:31.691 --> 00:08:36.691
<v Speaker 1>last four years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why did this happen?</v>

155
00:08:45.090 --> 00:08:50.090
<v Speaker 1>Why did they see a huge 40% drop in </v>
<v Speaker 1>years when the US stock market has risen</v>

156
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.173
<v Speaker 1>like a rocket?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the main explanation there via is </v>

157
00:08:53.941 --> 00:08:57.060
<v Speaker 1>that times are changing was a time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>these big bikes,</v>

158
00:08:57.061 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>these huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful,</v>

159
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>noisy beast sweat something of a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>for many Americans.</v>

160
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.700
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>due to the price,</v>

161
00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.980
<v Speaker 1>they are very expensive and changing </v>
<v Speaker 1>tastes.</v>

162
00:09:07.981 --> 00:09:11.400
<v Speaker 1>Today's generations aren't as attracted </v>
<v Speaker 1>to this type of motorcycle.</v>

163
00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:12.263
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average age of holly earners in the </v>

164
00:09:13.801 --> 00:09:18.801
<v Speaker 1>United States today is over 50 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Zillow vis,</v>

165
00:09:19.320 --> 00:09:20.153
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>translates into the number of sales at </v>

166
00:09:22.411 --> 00:09:23.244
<v Speaker 1>the company I'm making.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And therefore their profits in the last </v>

167
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:26.184
<v Speaker 1>three years alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the company's sales have decreased by </v>

168
00:09:27.571 --> 00:09:28.404
<v Speaker 1>10% of profits of full length,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 40% and in 2018 things are even </v>

169
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:33.253
<v Speaker 1>worse.</v>

170
00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:36.963
<v Speaker 1>Just a viewer is why this company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they need to look abroad both to Europe </v>

171
00:09:40.301 --> 00:09:41.134
<v Speaker 1>and Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Because if there is no commercial </v>

172
00:09:42.521 --> 00:09:44.440
<v Speaker 1>freedom and there are tariffs </v>
<v Speaker 1>production,</v>

173
00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.423
<v Speaker 1>it just has to go to other places </v>
<v Speaker 1>because no Harley Davidson's decisions </v>

174
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.990
<v Speaker 1>got nothing to do with politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And of course it's not a betrayal.</v>

175
00:09:56.020 --> 00:09:56.853
<v Speaker 1>It's simply an economic and </v>
<v Speaker 1>understandably logical decision made by </v>

176
00:10:00.131 --> 00:10:03.850
<v Speaker 1>a company that simply has to compete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something by the way,</v>

177
00:10:03.851 --> 00:10:04.684
<v Speaker 1>isn't easy now that they have to face </v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of the commercial war </v>

178
00:10:07.211 --> 00:10:09.490
<v Speaker 1>that Washington has unleashed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You know what?</v>

179
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:12.160
<v Speaker 1>This is not an isolated case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Listen to this</v>

180
00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:21.970
<v Speaker 6>multinationals,</v>
<v Speaker 6>drums,</v>

181
00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:23.620
<v Speaker 1>lessees,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hom,</v>

182
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:27.090
<v Speaker 1>American companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and by extension the American economy.</v>

183
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.010
<v Speaker 1>And of course the further of the war </v>
<v Speaker 1>goes,</v>

184
00:10:29.011 --> 00:10:30.780
<v Speaker 1>the greater the consequences will be.</v>

185
00:10:30.940 --> 00:10:31.773
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

186
00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:33.933
<v Speaker 1>The moments American multinationals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of whipped supported trump park </v>

187
00:10:36.451 --> 00:10:39.120
<v Speaker 1>getting very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very nervous about this whole thing.</v>

188
00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:39.983
<v Speaker 1>General Motors itself has said that if </v>
<v Speaker 1>the president finally approves tariffs </v>

189
00:10:42.601 --> 00:10:43.434
<v Speaker 1>on vehicle importations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's something that the White House </v>

190
00:10:45.031 --> 00:10:45.864
<v Speaker 1>raised recently.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The consequences would be less </v>

191
00:10:47.761 --> 00:10:48.594
<v Speaker 1>investment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that fewer jobs and fewer wages for </v>

192
00:10:50.071 --> 00:10:52.470
<v Speaker 1>General Motors workers in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

193
00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:55.170
<v Speaker 1>Take for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the case of another us icon,</v>

194
00:10:55.171 --> 00:10:56.004
<v Speaker 1>the Ford Mustang,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which of course is assembled in the </v>

195
00:10:57.661 --> 00:11:00.450
<v Speaker 1>United States and exported from there to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rest of it.</v>

196
00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:01.284
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well about 48% of the mustangs </v>

197
00:11:09.241 --> 00:11:11.790
<v Speaker 1>components come from outside of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>

198
00:11:11.791 --> 00:11:14.400
<v Speaker 1>so if those import south punished with </v>
<v Speaker 1>tariffs,</v>

199
00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.170
<v Speaker 1>the result is a more expensive car,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both for American consumers as well as,</v>

200
00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:25.660
<v Speaker 3>so we only have two</v>

201
00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:26.753
<v Speaker 1>American Aniko Ford mustangs and Harley </v>
<v Speaker 1>Davidson's being negatively affected by </v>

202
00:11:30.391 --> 00:11:32.370
<v Speaker 1>trump's policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a good thing,</v>

203
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.490
<v Speaker 6>right?</v>
<v Speaker 6>America first America first,</v>

204
00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:41.140
<v Speaker 1>and companies from other countries that </v>
<v Speaker 1>have factories in the United States such</v>

205
00:11:41.141 --> 00:11:43.690
<v Speaker 1>as Toyota for your Chrysler,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Daimler and BMW.</v>

206
00:11:43.750 --> 00:11:48.670
<v Speaker 1>A warning of the dangers of this war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mercedes Benz parent company.</v>

207
00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Daimler warned that dueling tariffs </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the United States and China will</v>

208
00:11:53.381 --> 00:11:57.880
<v Speaker 1>hit its earnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Specifically for SUV is made in Alabama,</v>

209
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.700
<v Speaker 1>but this isn't only effecting the </v>
<v Speaker 1>automotive industry,</v>

210
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.534
<v Speaker 1>it's virtually all sectors because yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's true that the United States is the </v>

211
00:12:05.591 --> 00:12:09.650
<v Speaker 1>largest economy on the planet has,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do not forget that 85% of its GDP in</v>

212
00:12:09.651 --> 00:12:12.400
<v Speaker 1>most of its growth happens outside its </v>
<v Speaker 1>borders.</v>

213
00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:14.650
<v Speaker 1>Closing up,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simply bad for business.</v>

214
00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:20.253
<v Speaker 1>Knitting barriers goes precisely against</v>
<v Speaker 1>the interests of a country that has </v>

215
00:12:23.081 --> 00:12:23.914
<v Speaker 1>currently got a lot of employment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is hitting record numbers in terms of </v>

216
00:12:26.471 --> 00:12:30.400
<v Speaker 1>workers and has the largest industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and its history.</v>

217
00:12:30.430 --> 00:12:31.263
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know Donald Trump talks a lot about </v>

218
00:12:32.711 --> 00:12:35.710
<v Speaker 1>the trade deficits and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there really is one,</v>

219
00:12:35.711 --> 00:12:38.470
<v Speaker 1>but that's not for the reason that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president's states,</v>

220
00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.333
<v Speaker 1>you see the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't have a trade deficit because </v>

221
00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:43.510
<v Speaker 1>it's being robust,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

222
00:12:43.511 --> 00:12:44.344
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's simply got it because this is an </v>

223
00:12:45.251 --> 00:12:47.890
<v Speaker 1>economy that consumes more than it </v>
<v Speaker 1>produces.</v>

224
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:50.080
<v Speaker 1>If Donald Trump wants to reduce the </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficits,</v>

225
00:12:50.081 --> 00:12:51.190
<v Speaker 1>he can't.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

226
00:12:51.220 --> 00:12:54.910
<v Speaker 1>stop the immense public spending that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>causing so many problems.</v>

227
00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:55.773
<v Speaker 1>As we saw in this previous video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can also promote savings and </v>

228
00:12:58.570 --> 00:12:59.403
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the companies are more productive </v>

229
00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.800
<v Speaker 1>among many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many other things.</v>

230
00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.693
<v Speaker 1>And the overall reality is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that this trade war is kind of bad </v>

231
00:13:06.341 --> 00:13:08.590
<v Speaker 1>for everyone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

232
00:13:08.710 --> 00:13:11.290
<v Speaker 1>What do you think about the trade war?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you support it d and not?</v>

233
00:13:11.291 --> 00:13:12.124
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>leave your answer in the comments below </v>
