1
00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:11.550
<v Speaker 1>Japan a country that brags about two </v>
<v Speaker 1>things.</v>

2
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.730
<v Speaker 1>The first is the used underwear vending </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

3
00:00:14.731 --> 00:00:17.370
<v Speaker 1>which yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you really can find on the streets,</v>

4
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.263
<v Speaker 1>and the second is the immigration rates,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is by far the lowest in the </v>

5
00:00:21.391 --> 00:00:24.450
<v Speaker 1>developed world for comparison in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

6
00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>The immigrant population is about 14 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

7
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.420
<v Speaker 1>Canada and New Zealand's have 20 and 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent respectively.</v>

8
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.830
<v Speaker 1>And then this Japan with an immigration </v>
<v Speaker 1>population of less than two percent.</v>

9
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.280
<v Speaker 1>What's the reason for this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

10
00:00:44.281 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 1>quite simply it's they're very </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictive immigration system.</v>

11
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.593
<v Speaker 1>This makes Japan something of a dream </v>
<v Speaker 1>country for politicians like Donald </v>

12
00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.213
<v Speaker 1>Trump or marine le pen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If there is one word that could define </v>

13
00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:59.190
<v Speaker 1>the current political debate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that word would be immigration.</v>

14
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.143
<v Speaker 1>In Europe,</v>
<v Speaker 1>countries are arguing about what to do </v>

15
00:01:01.561 --> 00:01:02.394
<v Speaker 1>with refugees and it seems the </v>
<v Speaker 1>politicians across the board seemed to </v>

16
00:01:05.221 --> 00:01:08.250
<v Speaker 1>think that immigration is a problem that</v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to be stopped.</v>

17
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.193
<v Speaker 2>Immigration has fallen under this </v>
<v Speaker 2>government and we've cut net migration </v>

18
00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:12.074
<v Speaker 2>by a third.</v>

19
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.943
<v Speaker 3>Anyone who illegally crosses the border </v>
<v Speaker 3>will be detained until they are removed </v>

20
00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.160
<v Speaker 3>out of our country and back to the </v>
<v Speaker 3>country from which they came.</v>

21
00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:24.603
<v Speaker 2>Since I took office,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we've deployed more border agents and </v>

22
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
<v Speaker 2>technology to our southern border than </v>
<v Speaker 2>ever before,</v>

23
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.250
<v Speaker 1>so then Japan is a perfect example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>what our country would look like without</v>

24
00:01:36.251 --> 00:01:37.084
<v Speaker 1>really many immigrants at all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering what </v>

25
00:01:39.341 --> 00:01:41.950
<v Speaker 1>exactly does that mean for Japan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy?</v>

26
00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.843
<v Speaker 1>Do they really save money because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have to spend on social policies </v>

27
00:01:45.671 --> 00:01:46.504
<v Speaker 1>for immigrants further deep Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>work as enjoy a higher standard of life </v>

28
00:01:49.961 --> 00:01:52.960
<v Speaker 1>because they don't have to compete for </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs with foreign workers.</v>

29
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.050
<v Speaker 1>Hands on this episode of visual politics</v>

30
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.370
<v Speaker 2>going to be answering those questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Before we get into all of that,</v>

31
00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:02.700
<v Speaker 2>we need to have a close look at Japan's </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigration law.</v>

32
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.143
<v Speaker 4>Yeah,</v>

33
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.620
<v Speaker 1>country one culture,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one race.</v>

34
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.483
<v Speaker 1>This statement was said by the man who </v>
<v Speaker 1>was the prime minister of Japan in the </v>

35
00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.380
<v Speaker 1>mid 19 eighties.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Viceman was Yasuhiro Naca.</v>

36
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.090
<v Speaker 1>The Statesman's clearly summarizes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration policy of Japan.</v>

37
00:02:19.091 --> 00:02:23.200
<v Speaker 1>Basically there are two ways to get into</v>
<v Speaker 1>the land of the rising sun.</v>

38
00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.100
<v Speaker 1>One is where they work contracts and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>other is with a tourist visa.</v>

39
00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.380
<v Speaker 1>If a company wants to hire you from </v>
<v Speaker 1>overseas,</v>

40
00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:30.214
<v Speaker 1>you will need a work visa and the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>possible way that you can get that visa </v>

41
00:02:33.131 --> 00:02:33.964
<v Speaker 1>is do you have a university degree or </v>
<v Speaker 1>have some specific skills that are </v>

42
00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:39.910
<v Speaker 1>practically impossible to find in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese labor markets,</v>

43
00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.010
<v Speaker 1>so if you are just to construction </v>
<v Speaker 1>worker,</v>

44
00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:44.740
<v Speaker 1>you are never going to get a work permit</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Japan.</v>

45
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.680
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unless you use this other program</v>

46
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.790
<v Speaker 2>on Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 2>didn't have a lot to accept workers from</v>

47
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:56.550
<v Speaker 2>other Asian countries like Vietnam or </v>
<v Speaker 2>Philippines.</v>

48
00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.940
<v Speaker 2>They graded the so called technical </v>
<v Speaker 2>internal training program.</v>

49
00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.300
<v Speaker 1>This in summary is sort of like being an</v>
<v Speaker 1>intern in Japan,</v>

50
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.090
<v Speaker 1>except you get about half the salary.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's a Japanese in turn would get not</v>

51
00:03:08.091 --> 00:03:08.924
<v Speaker 1>only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but with this technical internal </v>

52
00:03:10.071 --> 00:03:10.904
<v Speaker 1>training program,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your boss has even allowed to hold onto </v>

53
00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:15.290
<v Speaker 1>your passport and access your bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

54
00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.500
<v Speaker 1>More worryingly than that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since they started this program,</v>

55
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.620
<v Speaker 1>thousands of Asian immigrants have </v>
<v Speaker 1>simply disappeared.</v>

56
00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.923
<v Speaker 1>For</v>

57
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.880
<v Speaker 2>when the Union Representative I spoke </v>
<v Speaker 2>with me,</v>

58
00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.013
<v Speaker 2>she said that my attitude was bad and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that if I continue to have this heavy </v>

59
00:03:32.561 --> 00:03:35.740
<v Speaker 2>dude,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if my actions continued her friend,</v>

60
00:03:35.741 --> 00:03:38.340
<v Speaker 2>we'll hire a hitman to kill channel.</v>

61
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:40.293
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what if you ended up with a tourist </v>

62
00:03:41.771 --> 00:03:42.551
<v Speaker 1>visa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

63
00:03:42.551 --> 00:03:45.880
<v Speaker 1>in that case you can stand the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>for a year and a half as long as you can</v>

64
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.720
<v Speaker 1>prove that you are studying Japanese.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once that initial time has passed,</v>

65
00:03:49.721 --> 00:03:50.554
<v Speaker 1>you need to get hired by a company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could lead to you getting a work </v>

66
00:03:53.351 --> 00:03:54.184
<v Speaker 1>visa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do watch out here because unlike in </v>

67
00:03:55.361 --> 00:03:57.670
<v Speaker 1>the United States or certain European </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>

68
00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.330
<v Speaker 1>this work visa stipulates what your </v>
<v Speaker 1>profession is.</v>

69
00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:02.283
<v Speaker 1>So for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you get that work visa saying that </v>

70
00:04:04.331 --> 00:04:05.164
<v Speaker 1>you are a chef,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then you could only work in a </v>

71
00:04:07.061 --> 00:04:07.894
<v Speaker 1>restaurant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you break this rule and do some sort </v>

72
00:04:09.521 --> 00:04:10.354
<v Speaker 1>of other work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then the government will not renew your </v>

73
00:04:11.951 --> 00:04:12.784
<v Speaker 1>visa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is only one really effective way </v>

74
00:04:14.111 --> 00:04:16.060
<v Speaker 1>for a foreign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So you make a living in Japan,</v>

75
00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.103
<v Speaker 2>the most part thing to get the was like </v>
<v Speaker 2>the easiest thing to live here is </v>

76
00:04:19.491 --> 00:04:21.500
<v Speaker 2>marrying a Japanese person.</v>

77
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:22.503
<v Speaker 1>Now I heard you can understand why in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with over 127 million </v>

78
00:04:27.161 --> 00:04:30.370
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I need 2 million of them are immigrants,</v>

79
00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.270
<v Speaker 1>but what consequences does this have on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the daily lives of Japanese citizens?</v>

80
00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:42.110
<v Speaker 2>He's a Japanese pensions.</v>

81
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.860
<v Speaker 1>Japan is the oldest country in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world,</v>

82
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.783
<v Speaker 1>not because of that long history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but because of the actual physical age </v>

83
00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.330
<v Speaker 1>of their population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact estimation save.</v>

84
00:04:51.331 --> 00:04:52.164
<v Speaker 1>It's in the next 90 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're going to lose about 44 million </v>

85
00:04:55.061 --> 00:04:55.894
<v Speaker 1>people from their population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is about the entire population of </v>

86
00:04:59.291 --> 00:05:00.124
<v Speaker 1>Canada and now this wouldn't be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>problem if it wasn't for these social </v>

87
00:05:03.011 --> 00:05:05.860
<v Speaker 1>security system.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know the pen.</v>

88
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.783
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the pension system in most countries in </v>

89
00:05:08.201 --> 00:05:11.470
<v Speaker 1>the world works in the following way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The people who are working today are the</v>

90
00:05:11.471 --> 00:05:14.530
<v Speaker 1>ones who are paying the pensions of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>people who are retired today.</v>

91
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:16.980
<v Speaker 1>As the workforce gets smaller and </v>
<v Speaker 1>smaller night,</v>

92
00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.823
<v Speaker 1>year after year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of people paying those </v>

93
00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:23.470
<v Speaker 1>pensions is getting smaller.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further on the other side of things,</v>

94
00:05:23.471 --> 00:05:26.460
<v Speaker 1>more and more people are retiring who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are drawing more ends,</v>

95
00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:30.220
<v Speaker 1>more social security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this leads to problems like this.</v>

96
00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.163
<v Speaker 4>Yes,</v>

97
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:37.820
<v Speaker 2>social security contributions cover only</v>
<v Speaker 2>60 percent of these benefits,</v>

98
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:43.180
<v Speaker 2>the remaining 40 trillion jen comes from</v>
<v Speaker 2>taxes or more precisely public deficits</v>

99
00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:49.733
<v Speaker 1>way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The music you're hearing in this video </v>

100
00:05:50.891 --> 00:05:51.724
<v Speaker 1>is from the Spanish band Mescalina if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you like it and want to check out more </v>

101
00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.010
<v Speaker 1>of their stuff and do you look in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>description box?</v>

102
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.280
<v Speaker 1>Why pay attention to this mosque?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan has the highest public debt of any</v>

103
00:06:10.141 --> 00:06:10.974
<v Speaker 1>country in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their current debt level is more than </v>

104
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.920
<v Speaker 1>double the GDP and to their fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 1>deficits.</v>

105
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:17.783
<v Speaker 1>The difference between the income and </v>
<v Speaker 1>this spending is higher than the one in </v>

106
00:06:20.821 --> 00:06:23.030
<v Speaker 1>the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

107
00:06:23.031 --> 00:06:26.180
<v Speaker 1>if Angela Merkel where to go to Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she had probably get very,</v>

108
00:06:26.181 --> 00:06:28.340
<v Speaker 1>very angry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So like now you might be wondering,</v>

109
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.174
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what does all of this have to do with </v>

110
00:06:29.751 --> 00:06:31.040
<v Speaker 1>integration?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

111
00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:33.290
<v Speaker 1>the answer is a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

112
00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:36.900
<v Speaker 1>we've all heard about how expensive it </v>
<v Speaker 1>is to integrate immigrants.</v>

113
00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:40.350
<v Speaker 1>You have to pay for social programs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>integration courses,</v>

114
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:41.193
<v Speaker 1>etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But no onE really talks about how much </v>

115
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:44.540
<v Speaker 1>are you native citizens costs.</v>

116
00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:45.930
<v Speaker 4>Yup.</v>

117
00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:48.593
<v Speaker 1>For an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>an american Born citizen costs the </v>

118
00:06:50.671 --> 00:06:51.504
<v Speaker 1>government $150,000 by the time age 16,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this is only for education and </v>

119
00:06:58.111 --> 00:07:00.570
<v Speaker 1>health care depending on the state that </v>
<v Speaker 1>that person lives in.</v>

120
00:07:00.571 --> 00:07:01.404
<v Speaker 1>You minds have to add in other expenses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the government sees all of this as </v>

121
00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:06.720
<v Speaker 1>an investment because when that person </v>
<v Speaker 1>stops paying taxes,</v>

122
00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.390
<v Speaker 1>they're going to get that money back.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>

123
00:07:09.391 --> 00:07:12.300
<v Speaker 1>let's take an example of a vietnamese </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants to Japan.</v>

124
00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.193
<v Speaker 1>He comes to the country when he is old </v>
<v Speaker 1>enough to start whacking his education </v>

125
00:07:15.931 --> 00:07:20.931
<v Speaker 1>and healthcare was already paid for by </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vehicle average of two years.</v>

126
00:07:23.361 --> 00:07:26.180
<v Speaker 1>That'd be in the knees.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Immigrants is going to find a job.</v>

127
00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:26.901
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>

128
00:07:26.901 --> 00:07:30.170
<v Speaker 1>that might be a low page one and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>might pay just a little tax,</v>

129
00:07:30.230 --> 00:07:33.320
<v Speaker 1>but the japanese government didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 1>to invest any money in,</v>

130
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:35.150
<v Speaker 1>so in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrant,</v>

131
00:07:35.151 --> 00:07:36.860
<v Speaker 1>so free cash,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the government,</v>

132
00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:37.753
<v Speaker 1>since Japan has so few immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are losing out on this easy influx </v>

133
00:07:41.750 --> 00:07:42.583
<v Speaker 1>of cash.</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is why in the middle of a fiscal </v>

134
00:07:44.211 --> 00:07:48.170
<v Speaker 1>crisis in 2015,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the japanese prime minister shinzo are.</v>

135
00:07:48.171 --> 00:07:49.004
<v Speaker 1>They made the following amount under </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure to accept more immigrants as </v>

136
00:07:59.161 --> 00:08:01.470
<v Speaker 1>workforce shrinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But despite what it looks like,</v>

137
00:08:01.471 --> 00:08:02.304
<v Speaker 1>this is not japan's biggest problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan has seen the last 20 years go by </v>

138
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.440
<v Speaker 1>with no economic growth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what experts have goals the last</v>

139
00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:13.660
<v Speaker 1>decades and it has a lot to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigration as well.</v>

140
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.260
<v Speaker 1>Create that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It stopped innovating.</v>

141
00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:23.280
<v Speaker 1>We all want to enter in Japan as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>country of technology and innovation.</v>

142
00:08:23.430 --> 00:08:25.410
<v Speaker 1>The country where companies like </v>
<v Speaker 1>nintendo,</v>

143
00:08:25.411 --> 00:08:26.430
<v Speaker 1>sony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>toshiba,</v>

144
00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:27.293
<v Speaker 1>where they will</v>

145
00:08:28.930 --> 00:08:31.160
<v Speaker 4>on line.</v>

146
00:08:31.390 --> 00:08:34.210
<v Speaker 1>So the reality is these companies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>really old.</v>

147
00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:36.520
<v Speaker 1>Nintendo was founded in 18,</v>
<v Speaker 1>89,</v>

148
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.160
<v Speaker 1>and so I always said it was created in </v>
<v Speaker 1>1937.</v>

149
00:08:39.330 --> 00:08:40.163
<v Speaker 1>Actually.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Can anybody name any japanese companies </v>

150
00:08:42.061 --> 00:08:45.030
<v Speaker 1>that were created in the 21st century?</v>
<v Speaker 1>You probably couldn't,</v>

151
00:08:45.050 --> 00:08:45.883
<v Speaker 1>but on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could probably name five to 10 </v>

152
00:08:47.401 --> 00:08:49.710
<v Speaker 1>american companies that were formed </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the same.</v>

153
00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:56.813
<v Speaker 1>It started at 52 percent of all new </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley companies between 1995 </v>

154
00:09:01.890 --> 00:09:02.723
<v Speaker 1>and 2005.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The entrepreneurial rates among </v>

155
00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:09.600
<v Speaker 1>immigrant populations is two to three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times higher than natives,</v>

156
00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:12.750
<v Speaker 1>and this is a trend that you find in </v>
<v Speaker 1>every country.</v>

157
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:14.820
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the founders of google,</v>

158
00:09:14.821 --> 00:09:19.110
<v Speaker 1>sanjay brinn was born in moscow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The cofounder of whatsapp was born in.</v>

159
00:09:19.111 --> 00:09:24.111
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just about silicon valley startups.</v>

160
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:27.283
<v Speaker 1>Just take a walk around your </v>
<v Speaker 1>neighborhood and you'll see hundreds of </v>

161
00:09:29.301 --> 00:09:31.580
<v Speaker 1>chinese doors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mexican restaurants,</v>

162
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.473
<v Speaker 1>and all other kinds of small businesses </v>
<v Speaker 1>created by immigrants and it does make </v>

163
00:09:36.381 --> 00:09:39.830
<v Speaker 1>complete sense that immigrants will have</v>
<v Speaker 1>an entrepreneurial spirit.</v>

164
00:09:39.890 --> 00:09:40.880
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>though,</v>

165
00:09:40.881 --> 00:09:43.790
<v Speaker 1>you seem leave their home country on </v>
<v Speaker 1>risk takers.</v>

166
00:09:43.850 --> 00:09:47.030
<v Speaker 1>Not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants bring with them their culture</v>

167
00:09:47.031 --> 00:09:48.890
<v Speaker 1>to a new country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps them.</v>

168
00:09:48.891 --> 00:09:50.190
<v Speaker 1>In thinking outside of the.</v>

169
00:09:53.500 --> 00:09:54.340
<v Speaker 4>Let's take a look.</v>

170
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:57.500
<v Speaker 1>There's another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles feldman was a german immigrants.</v>

171
00:09:57.501 --> 00:10:01.230
<v Speaker 1>Do New York city in the 19th century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soon he realized that the work is in the</v>

172
00:10:01.231 --> 00:10:02.064
<v Speaker 1>city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>needed some sort of food that can be </v>

173
00:10:03.411 --> 00:10:04.244
<v Speaker 1>cooked and sold on the streets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's when he decided to import </v>

174
00:10:06.831 --> 00:10:10.640
<v Speaker 1>sausages from his home country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's when the hot dog was born.</v>

175
00:10:10.670 --> 00:10:15.440
<v Speaker 1>TodaY this meal feeds millions of people</v>
<v Speaker 1>from all around the planets and this.</v>

176
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:16.483
<v Speaker 1>This is just one example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are thousands upon thousands more </v>

177
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.553
<v Speaker 1>in short,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when cultures mixed new ideas and </v>

178
00:10:23.331 --> 00:10:24.164
<v Speaker 1>methodologies are created.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is what business people call </v>

179
00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.273
<v Speaker 1>innovation and this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the special sauce that makes </v>

180
00:10:30.891 --> 00:10:32.300
<v Speaker 1>companies and countries</v>

181
00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:38.040
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going on in Japan?</v>

182
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:38.953
<v Speaker 1>I'm surprisingly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan has the lowest entrepreneurial </v>

183
00:10:40.921 --> 00:10:41.754
<v Speaker 1>rate in the developed world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Just seven percent oF the population </v>

184
00:10:44.221 --> 00:10:47.580
<v Speaker 1>decides to start a business by </v>
<v Speaker 1>comparison and countries like Canada and</v>

185
00:10:47.581 --> 00:10:49.770
<v Speaker 1>New Zealand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That percentage is about 10 percent.</v>

186
00:10:49.880 --> 00:10:52.080
<v Speaker 1>The japanese dream isn't to start your </v>
<v Speaker 1>own business.</v>

187
00:10:52.081 --> 00:10:54.750
<v Speaker 1>It's to get hot by one that already </v>
<v Speaker 1>exists.</v>

188
00:10:54.780 --> 00:10:57.030
<v Speaker 1>You know those big companies that we </v>
<v Speaker 1>previously mentioned,</v>

189
00:10:57.060 --> 00:10:57.893
<v Speaker 1>like sony and sheba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>companies that have the same corporate </v>

190
00:11:00.211 --> 00:11:01.044
<v Speaker 1>and work structure that they had in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>19 eighties traditional japanese </v>

191
00:11:07.731 --> 00:11:08.564
<v Speaker 1>electronic power houses such as sharp </v>
<v Speaker 1>and sony having kurt huge losses and </v>

192
00:11:13.431 --> 00:11:16.190
<v Speaker 1>shed thousands of jobs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well competitors,</v>

193
00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.420
<v Speaker 1>apple and sAmsung have continued to </v>
<v Speaker 1>increase their market shares,</v>

194
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.313
<v Speaker 1>lazy like football or what american </v>
<v Speaker 1>schools soccer like keep up with the </v>

195
00:11:23.661 --> 00:11:27.500
<v Speaker 1>world cup or the us championships.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Twenty years ago there were at least two</v>

196
00:11:27.501 --> 00:11:31.160
<v Speaker 1>japanese companies sponsoring these </v>
<v Speaker 1>events in 2016.</v>

197
00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:35.930
<v Speaker 1>The european cup had no japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>sponsors and no matter where you look,</v>

198
00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.793
<v Speaker 1>japanese companies are struggling to </v>
<v Speaker 1>compete with the european american </v>

199
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.110
<v Speaker 1>indian,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chinese companies,</v>

200
00:11:42.170 --> 00:11:45.410
<v Speaker 1>and the reason is not a lack of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a lack of innovation.</v>

201
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:46.303
<v Speaker 1>And this explains why japan's economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been so frozen over the last few </v>

202
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:51.343
<v Speaker 1>days.</v>

203
00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:56.713
<v Speaker 1>This is having a major impact on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>millions of Japan citizens in order to </v>

204
00:11:59.721 --> 00:12:00.554
<v Speaker 1>keep productivity up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese workers have the longest </v>

205
00:12:02.661 --> 00:12:06.680
<v Speaker 1>working hours and the shortest holidays </v>
<v Speaker 1>of any developed nation.</v>

206
00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.633
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they still have the same salaries that </v>

207
00:12:09.001 --> 00:12:14.001
<v Speaker 1>the pattern.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that is our opinion here,</v>

208
00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.310
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now we would love to know yours.</v>

209
00:12:17.311 --> 00:12:18.144
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Japan should open its doors</v>
<v Speaker 1>to immigrants or do you think other </v>

210
00:12:20.701 --> 00:12:24.870
<v Speaker 1>countries should follow japan's example </v>
<v Speaker 1>and close their doors to immigrants?</v>
