00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.150
<v Speaker 2>have you ever heard this phrase?</v>

3
00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:13.543
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

4
00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:16.250
<v Speaker 2>Sounds pretty good,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

5
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.960
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's quite a proclamation,</v>

6
00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.843
<v Speaker 2>a call to an epic objective and appeal </v>
<v Speaker 2>to the people's pride towards </v>

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.930
<v Speaker 2>resistance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But truth is though,</v>

8
00:00:23.931 --> 00:00:24.764
<v Speaker 2>that over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this slogan has become one of the </v>

9
00:00:26.241 --> 00:00:29.450
<v Speaker 2>chance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the essential slogans of every protest,</v>

10
00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.343
<v Speaker 2>especially in Latin America and </v>
<v Speaker 2>especially in protests and </v>

11
00:00:33.291 --> 00:00:34.124
<v Speaker 2>demonstrations of Marxist Leninist,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maoist and socialist movements of all </v>

12
00:00:37.551 --> 00:00:38.560
<v Speaker 2>kinds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Going back,</v>

13
00:00:38.561 --> 00:00:43.561
<v Speaker 2>one thing [inaudible] what about the get</v>
<v Speaker 2>that'll regarding battle,</v>

14
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.090
<v Speaker 2>because there aren't the 20th century,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these types of chance,</v>

15
00:00:47.091 --> 00:00:47.924
<v Speaker 2>proclamations and slogans supported a </v>
<v Speaker 2>huge number of groups and protest </v>

16
00:00:51.411 --> 00:00:52.244
<v Speaker 2>movements throughout Latin America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This happened to such an extent that in </v>

17
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.470
<v Speaker 2>many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these epicondyle brave slogans,</v>

18
00:00:57.471 --> 00:00:58.304
<v Speaker 2>they had a far more terrible phenomenon </v>
<v Speaker 2>of phenomenon that it became one of the </v>

19
00:01:01.761 --> 00:01:04.850
<v Speaker 2>most remarkable characteristics of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire region,</v>

20
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:05.713
<v Speaker 2>the gorillas,</v>

21
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.820
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] [inaudible].</v>

22
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:17.870
<v Speaker 2>What does the gorilla phenomenon consist</v>
<v Speaker 2>of and why did it emerge?</v>

23
00:01:17.871 --> 00:01:18.704
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>how could gorillas have such an impact </v>

24
00:01:20.601 --> 00:01:22.350
<v Speaker 2>and so much power in,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

25
00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.740
<v Speaker 2>what's their situation like today?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What are we going around?</v>

26
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:26.990
<v Speaker 2>So all of those questions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and there's a video,</v>

27
00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.580
<v Speaker 2>but first a bit of history</v>

28
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.690
<v Speaker 1>come,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hey,</v>

29
00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:42.260
<v Speaker 2>the spark that ignited the flame is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1960s the gorilla phenomenon is about to</v>

30
00:01:44.411 --> 00:01:46.980
<v Speaker 2>begin the Cuban revolution.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's just happens.</v>

31
00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:49.270
<v Speaker 2>And folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we really can't talk about guerrillas in</v>

32
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:52.270
<v Speaker 2>Latin America without us taking Cuba's </v>
<v Speaker 2>roll into account.</v>

33
00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.400
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

34
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.233
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Cuban revolution was a great source </v>

35
00:01:58.341 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 2>of inspiration for all kinds of anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>imperialist,</v>

36
00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:04.070
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary and communist movements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not only that,</v>

37
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.933
<v Speaker 2>but over the years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba say became the number one promoter </v>

38
00:02:07.101 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 2>of guerrilla groups in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 2>region.</v>

39
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.970
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We could say that Cuba,</v>

40
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.040
<v Speaker 2>it was quite a powerful station,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that center.</v>

41
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.813
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that the myth of the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 2>Revolution was the main reason that </v>

42
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.750
<v Speaker 2>thousands of young idealists,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in many cases with good intentions helps</v>

43
00:02:23.751 --> 00:02:24.584
<v Speaker 2>10 last in America into a Hornet's nest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How could they resist the exploits of </v>

44
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.390
<v Speaker 2>the Great Command of Fidel Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the leader of that supposedly managed to</v>

45
00:02:32.391 --> 00:02:34.880
<v Speaker 2>get the revolution running with just 82 </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

46
00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:36.710
<v Speaker 2>If he could do it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why could ends others?</v>

47
00:02:36.711 --> 00:02:38.180
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get the rifle boys.</v>

48
00:02:38.181 --> 00:02:39.170
<v Speaker 2>Let's crack on.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

49
00:02:39.171 --> 00:02:42.620
<v Speaker 2>many of these young people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they clearly felt this quite fervently.</v>

50
00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.330
<v Speaker 2>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the truth is that the revolution managed</v>

51
00:02:47.331 --> 00:02:48.164
<v Speaker 2>to triumph to a great extent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>is precisely because of the excessive </v>

52
00:02:50.931 --> 00:02:53.720
<v Speaker 2>violence and repression of the Cuban </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictator,</v>

53
00:02:53.721 --> 00:02:55.100
<v Speaker 2>full henslow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Battista.</v>

54
00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.500
<v Speaker 2>These were accesses that got a good part</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the army,</v>

55
00:02:57.501 --> 00:03:00.150
<v Speaker 2>including several officers who align </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Castro.</v>

56
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.063
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

57
00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.700
<v Speaker 2>And by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know that unlike what's commonly</v>

58
00:03:04.701 --> 00:03:05.534
<v Speaker 2>said to this heroic revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it didn't really have a clear </v>

59
00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.350
<v Speaker 2>ideological objective.</v>

60
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

61
00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.183
<v Speaker 2>in 1959 Fidel Castro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he never tired of repeating again and </v>

62
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:19.610
<v Speaker 2>again to the Cuban people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>among others.</v>

63
00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.460
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't a communist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Fidel himself,</v>

64
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.413
<v Speaker 2>he said this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know you're worried about whether or </v>

65
00:03:25.311 --> 00:03:27.890
<v Speaker 2>not were communists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I want to make this clear.</v>

66
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.500
<v Speaker 2>We aren't communists.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not a communist,</v>

67
00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:32.170
<v Speaker 2>and neither is our movement.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You,</v>

68
00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:35.840
<v Speaker 2>they'll Castro communities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And in a future video,</v>

69
00:03:35.841 --> 00:03:37.970
<v Speaker 2>we probably do need to talk about the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuban revolution.</v>

70
00:03:37.971 --> 00:03:40.460
<v Speaker 2>So we'll do that at some point in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>future.</v>

71
00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:41.330
<v Speaker 2>But folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many,</v>

72
00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:44.540
<v Speaker 2>many members over the revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they were communists.</v>

73
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.433
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't until two years after the </v>

74
00:03:46.491 --> 00:03:47.324
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary triumph in 1961 that Fidel</v>
<v Speaker 2>declared himself a Marxist Leninist and </v>

75
00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:53.450
<v Speaker 2>proclaimed the socialist revolution.</v>

76
00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.293
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

77
00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.983
<v Speaker 2>We can ask ourselves two questions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>What change in these two years and why </v>

78
00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:07.880
<v Speaker 2>is this important?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

79
00:04:07.881 --> 00:04:08.714
<v Speaker 2>listen up</v>

80
00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.160
<v Speaker 1>operation center</v>

81
00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.690
<v Speaker 2>speak their Washington politicians never</v>
<v Speaker 2>believed Fidel Castro statements denying</v>

82
00:04:23.691 --> 00:04:24.650
<v Speaker 2>communism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

83
00:04:24.651 --> 00:04:27.980
<v Speaker 2>they saw this new regime in Havana is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>danger during the cold war.</v>

84
00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.330
<v Speaker 2>That's how the disastrous Bay of Pigs </v>
<v Speaker 2>invasion attempt merged.</v>

85
00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.070
<v Speaker 2>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was quite clear to the Soviet Union</v>

86
00:04:34.071 --> 00:04:36.980
<v Speaker 2>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba meant an incredible opportunity and</v>

87
00:04:36.981 --> 00:04:38.570
<v Speaker 2>mainly for three reasons.</v>

88
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.670
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

89
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.210
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by allying with Cuba,</v>

90
00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.073
<v Speaker 2>they'd gain a very advantages </v>
<v Speaker 2>geographical position to the United </v>

91
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.630
<v Speaker 2>States.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They would have a friendly territory and</v>

92
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.870
<v Speaker 2>a military base just a few kilometers </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the American maintenance.</v>

93
00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:52.763
<v Speaker 2>Second day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>socialist Cuba would mean a new </v>

94
00:04:54.061 --> 00:04:54.894
<v Speaker 2>satellite stage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thus reinforcing that position in </v>

95
00:04:56.671 --> 00:04:58.740
<v Speaker 2>international politics and third,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba.</v>

96
00:04:58.741 --> 00:05:02.760
<v Speaker 2>It could become the operations center to</v>
<v Speaker 2>spread communism in the u s is so called</v>

97
00:05:02.761 --> 00:05:04.410
<v Speaker 2>back yard.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's Latin American.</v>

98
00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:05.293
<v Speaker 1>Gotcha.</v>

99
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.823
<v Speaker 2>That way folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that Soviet Union's chances of winning </v>

100
00:05:10.481 --> 00:05:11.314
<v Speaker 2>the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they absolutely grew stronger and you </v>

101
00:05:13.321 --> 00:05:14.154
<v Speaker 2>know what has we usually say here at </v>
<v Speaker 2>visual politic so that we said and say </v>

102
00:05:16.901 --> 00:05:19.540
<v Speaker 2>it was done.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The regime then led by Nikita Khrushchev</v>

103
00:05:19.541 --> 00:05:23.980
<v Speaker 2>concentrated on consolidating its </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations with the new Castro I'd Cuba,</v>

104
00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:27.150
<v Speaker 2>and it was quite a strong focus from </v>
<v Speaker 2>that very moment,</v>

105
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.680
<v Speaker 2>Cuba became a center for training,</v>
<v Speaker 2>financing,</v>

106
00:05:29.681 --> 00:05:33.460
<v Speaker 2>and supplying equipment and weapons for </v>
<v Speaker 2>their revolutionary movements throughout</v>

107
00:05:33.461 --> 00:05:34.294
<v Speaker 2>the continents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's how Havana became the biggest </v>

108
00:05:36.191 --> 00:05:38.530
<v Speaker 2>gorilla uprising promoter in Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

109
00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.540
<v Speaker 2>The duty of every revolutionary is to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make the revolution.</v>

110
00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.050
<v Speaker 2>The second declaration of Havana,</v>
<v Speaker 2>February 4th,</v>

111
00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.883
<v Speaker 2>1962 the idea development by El Che was </v>
<v Speaker 2>that a small group of activists could </v>

112
00:05:50.981 --> 00:05:51.814
<v Speaker 2>initiate a typical guerrilla war actions</v>
<v Speaker 2>and blew up existing institutions to </v>

113
00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.280
<v Speaker 2>spread the flames of the socialist.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And not just that,</v>

114
00:05:58.281 --> 00:06:02.060
<v Speaker 2>they also promoted a new strategy known </v>
<v Speaker 2>as cultural Marxism.</v>

115
00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 2>This,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

116
00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:03.883
<v Speaker 2>it's still seen in many places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what exactly does this strategy </v>

117
00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:07.543
<v Speaker 2>consistent of?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically it's using education and </v>

118
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:09.944
<v Speaker 2>culture app to help communist and </v>
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary ideologies infiltrates </v>

119
00:06:13.161 --> 00:06:13.994
<v Speaker 2>society to this ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Cuban regime supported the creation </v>

120
00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:17.750
<v Speaker 2>of songs,</v>
<v Speaker 2>poems,</v>

121
00:06:17.751 --> 00:06:18.584
<v Speaker 2>university writings into literary works </v>
<v Speaker 2>of all kinds with a common </v>

122
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:22.663
<v Speaker 2>characteristic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them were steeped in </v>

123
00:06:24.081 --> 00:06:26.750
<v Speaker 2>revolutionary ideology and among other </v>
<v Speaker 2>things,</v>

124
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:30.860
<v Speaker 2>extolled the gorilla figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Take Education and culture,</v>

125
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:33.650
<v Speaker 2>and the rest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We'll add on Antonio Gramsci.</v>

126
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:34.573
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you want to know more about how </v>

127
00:06:34.941 --> 00:06:37.340
<v Speaker 2>Havana supported some of the most famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>gorillas.</v>

128
00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.630
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen up</v>

129
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.503
<v Speaker 4>ties</v>

130
00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.690
<v Speaker 2>the first operation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it happens in Nicaragua.</v>

131
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:51.583
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to Moscow and Savannah's </v>
<v Speaker 2>technical and military and economic </v>

132
00:06:53.721 --> 00:06:54.554
<v Speaker 2>support.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Revolutionary Leader Carlos Fon </v>

133
00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:56.863
<v Speaker 2>sacker amador,</v>
<v Speaker 2>promoted the creation and organization </v>

134
00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:04.150
<v Speaker 2>of the Sandinista at National Liberation</v>
<v Speaker 2>Front in 1961 if you've heard of it,</v>

135
00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:06.620
<v Speaker 2>that's probably because it's Daniel </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ortega's movements.</v>

136
00:07:06.621 --> 00:07:07.454
<v Speaker 2>Who's the current tyrons presidents of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nicaragua about which we've already </v>

137
00:07:10.191 --> 00:07:12.320
<v Speaker 2>spoken in several videos here are visual</v>
<v Speaker 2>politic.</v>

138
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:14.350
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's go back to it.</v>

139
00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:16.240
<v Speaker 4>Yeah.</v>

140
00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.100
<v Speaker 2>In 1969 at Carlos Fonseca moved to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Havana where he spent the next six years</v>

141
00:07:21.130 --> 00:07:23.440
<v Speaker 2>from that he organized the Sandinista </v>
<v Speaker 2>Front.</v>

142
00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.333
<v Speaker 2>In 1975 he returns to Nicaragua to solve</v>
<v Speaker 2>some leadership problems and unify the </v>

143
00:07:28.541 --> 00:07:30.340
<v Speaker 2>gorilla group.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And although a year later,</v>

144
00:07:30.341 --> 00:07:31.174
<v Speaker 2>this revolutionary leader was </v>
<v Speaker 2>assassinated in 1979 the Sandinista </v>

145
00:07:34.211 --> 00:07:36.070
<v Speaker 2>friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they finally seized power.</v>

146
00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:38.810
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

147
00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:43.430
<v Speaker 2>The gorilla trained and financed and </v>
<v Speaker 2>supported by Havana at triumphed,</v>

148
00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:44.323
<v Speaker 2>the model it worked.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why stop in 1980 a year after the </v>

149
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:49.520
<v Speaker 2>Sandinista fronts triumph,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the F M N,</v>

150
00:07:49.550 --> 00:07:50.211
<v Speaker 2>l,</v>
<v Speaker 2>V,</v>

151
00:07:50.211 --> 00:07:50.881
<v Speaker 2>Pharaoh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Buddha,</v>

152
00:07:50.881 --> 00:07:51.714
<v Speaker 2>Marty France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>fuck national liberation was founded in </v>

153
00:07:53.871 --> 00:07:57.260
<v Speaker 2>El Salvador with Fidel Castro himself as</v>
<v Speaker 2>an intermediary.</v>

154
00:07:57.630 --> 00:07:58.463
<v Speaker 2>What's more of this group?</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was founded in [inaudible] honor </v>

155
00:08:00.591 --> 00:08:01.424
<v Speaker 2>itself.</v>

156
00:08:05.220 --> 00:08:05.480
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

157
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:06.313
<v Speaker 2>With the support of the Cuban regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>along with that of the new Nicaraguan </v>

158
00:08:09.021 --> 00:08:10.490
<v Speaker 2>government and Moscow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

159
00:08:10.491 --> 00:08:11.324
<v Speaker 2>the f m n l started it's armed fight </v>
<v Speaker 2>their training centers where the </v>

160
00:08:14.921 --> 00:08:17.480
<v Speaker 2>occasion in Cuba and Nicaragua,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course,</v>

161
00:08:17.481 --> 00:08:20.630
<v Speaker 2>it was those same countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which provided them with weapons,</v>

162
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:21.980
<v Speaker 2>supplies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>equipment,</v>

163
00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:23.180
<v Speaker 2>and anything else.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They need it.</v>

164
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:26.020
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

165
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.070
<v Speaker 2>hold on for a moment.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

166
00:08:28.071 --> 00:08:28.904
<v Speaker 2>the United States didn't just stand that</v>
<v Speaker 2>they weren't willing to give Havana </v>

167
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.583
<v Speaker 2>another victory,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they decided to support the </v>

168
00:08:35.311 --> 00:08:37.310
<v Speaker 2>Salvadoran government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their results.</v>

169
00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 2>12 years of fighting that cost more than</v>
<v Speaker 2>75,000 deaths,</v>

170
00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:44.960
<v Speaker 2>thousands more missing,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and an economic.</v>

171
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:52.653
<v Speaker 2>Now we can begin to understand the </v>
<v Speaker 2>magnitude of the violence that has </v>

172
00:08:55.501 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 2>destroyed so much of this region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that on this occasion,</v>

173
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.113
<v Speaker 2>the gorillas,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they didn't achieve a revolution and </v>

174
00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 2>after the peace agreement of 1990 they </v>
<v Speaker 2>formed a political party.</v>

175
00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.160
<v Speaker 2>Does any of this party governs El </v>
<v Speaker 2>Salvador runs?</v>

176
00:09:08.161 --> 00:09:08.994
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it hasn't hesitated to support Daniel </v>

177
00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:11.953
<v Speaker 2>Ortega's Nicaraguan regime,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but don't think for a second that this </v>

178
00:09:14.461 --> 00:09:17.190
<v Speaker 2>situation has happened solely in Central</v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

179
00:09:17.250 --> 00:09:18.083
<v Speaker 2>not at all the southern countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They also had that Shat South America </v>

180
00:09:21.091 --> 00:09:21.924
<v Speaker 2>also underwent a wave of revolutionary </v>
<v Speaker 2>movements in facts throughout Latin </v>

181
00:09:24.721 --> 00:09:25.554
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than a hundred hundred gorilla </v>

182
00:09:27.361 --> 00:09:28.194
<v Speaker 2>groups caused enormous damage.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Almost all of them were encouraged and </v>

183
00:09:31.591 --> 00:09:32.424
<v Speaker 2>supported by Cuba in one way or another.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's certainly true for the most </v>

184
00:09:36.031 --> 00:09:37.710
<v Speaker 2>famous gorilla groups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>FARC,</v>

185
00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:42.300
<v Speaker 2>the April 19th movement in Colombia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's the shining path in Peru,</v>

186
00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:46.310
<v Speaker 5>Shining Path.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Activists have been trained in Cuba,</v>

187
00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.130
<v Speaker 5>Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic</v>
<v Speaker 5>Republic.</v>

188
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.993
<v Speaker 5>Manuel who law,</v>
<v Speaker 5>former prime minster of Peru and </v>

189
00:09:52.131 --> 00:09:55.040
<v Speaker 5>statements to the bias newspaper in 1983</v>

190
00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:55.983
<v Speaker 2>all you surprise now that the peace </v>
<v Speaker 2>agreements between Fark and Juan Manuel </v>

191
00:09:58.870 --> 00:10:00.990
<v Speaker 2>Santos is Colombian government will be </v>
<v Speaker 2>negotiated in.</v>

192
00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:01.100
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

193
00:10:01.100 --> 00:10:01.933
<v Speaker 6>Vonda.</v>

194
00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:04.253
<v Speaker 2>Of course these huge groups,</v>
<v Speaker 2>true army is also had another </v>

195
00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:09.660
<v Speaker 2>fundamental support points and that's </v>
<v Speaker 2>drug money.</v>

196
00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:10.613
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>These groups ended up becoming drug </v>

197
00:10:11.581 --> 00:10:12.414
<v Speaker 2>traffickers business from which they </v>
<v Speaker 2>obtained the enormous resources they </v>

198
00:10:15.121 --> 00:10:19.340
<v Speaker 2>needed to continue the fight.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Awesome.</v>

199
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:23.000
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget that Cuba also went into </v>
<v Speaker 2>this business we told you about that.</v>

200
00:10:23.001 --> 00:10:23.834
<v Speaker 2>Here are visual politic in a recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>video about Nahko politics in this </v>

201
00:10:26.301 --> 00:10:27.860
<v Speaker 2>region of the wells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

202
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:28.694
<v Speaker 2>The Cuban government even associated </v>
<v Speaker 2>with Pablo Escobar himself and that's </v>

203
00:10:32.001 --> 00:10:34.190
<v Speaker 2>when it all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the last example of Cuban infiltration,</v>

204
00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:38.750
<v Speaker 2>we all know was in Venezuela and we've </v>
<v Speaker 2>already seen how things are giving that.</v>

205
00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:43.193
<v Speaker 6>Okay</v>

206
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:44.043
<v Speaker 2>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Cuba's influence on Latin American </v>

207
00:10:45.731 --> 00:10:48.400
<v Speaker 2>politics in the last 60 years has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>terrible.</v>

208
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:49.293
<v Speaker 2>Havana has played a major role in back </v>
<v Speaker 2>and guerrilla groups and regimes that </v>

209
00:10:52.061 --> 00:10:55.450
<v Speaker 2>have done absolutely no good for Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>America.</v>

210
00:10:55.510 --> 00:10:56.343
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know nowadays some people still </v>

211
00:10:57.611 --> 00:11:00.250
<v Speaker 2>view these groups with a certain </v>
<v Speaker 2>romanticism,</v>

212
00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:03.760
<v Speaker 2>but that really isn't mistake beyond the</v>
<v Speaker 2>feets and the myths,</v>

213
00:11:03.761 --> 00:11:06.010
<v Speaker 2>the real story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately,</v>

214
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:07.143
<v Speaker 2>it's terrible,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but fortunately the gorillas are now at </v>

215
00:11:08.831 --> 00:11:13.120
<v Speaker 2>the lowest point in decades and that at </v>
<v Speaker 2>least is good news.</v>

216
00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.560
<v Speaker 2>By the way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of the guerrilla groups,</v>

217
00:11:14.561 --> 00:11:17.020
<v Speaker 2>they weren't just Havana's faults.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In many cases,</v>

218
00:11:17.021 --> 00:11:17.854
<v Speaker 2>they were the fault if a terribly </v>
<v Speaker 2>extractive oligarchy that control to </v>

219
00:11:20.951 --> 00:11:21.784
<v Speaker 2>their country with an interest in </v>
<v Speaker 2>nothing but maintaining that own </v>

220
00:11:24.671 --> 00:11:25.504
<v Speaker 2>privileges.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This has also been one of the great </v>

221
00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:29.950
<v Speaker 2>evils of the region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So with this video,</v>

222
00:11:29.951 --> 00:11:30.784
<v Speaker 2>we can own fleet now better understand </v>
<v Speaker 2>how so many guerrilla groups suddenly </v>

223
00:11:33.611 --> 00:11:34.444
<v Speaker 2>emerged in Latin America and why </v>
<v Speaker 2>relations between Washington and Havana </v>

224
00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.300
<v Speaker 2>have traditionally been so bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The story,</v>

225
00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.110
<v Speaker 2>it goes far beyond the missile crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So I really hope you enjoyed that video.</v>
