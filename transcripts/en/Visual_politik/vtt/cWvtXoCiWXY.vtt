1
00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.840
<v Speaker 1>Today there are about 25 countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>without an army,</v>

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.210
<v Speaker 1>but I'll ask you which one of them was </v>
<v Speaker 1>fast?</v>

3
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:18.560
<v Speaker 1>Which country do you think was the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>he voluntarily give up its armed forces.</v>

4
00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:22.040
<v Speaker 1>If you guys do European country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you're not even on the right continence.</v>

5
00:00:22.041 --> 00:00:22.874
<v Speaker 1>It was actually a Latin American country</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that was of course Costa Rica on </v>

6
00:00:34.771 --> 00:00:37.790
<v Speaker 1>December the first 19,</v>
<v Speaker 1>48 after a civil war under president and</v>

7
00:00:37.791 --> 00:00:39.720
<v Speaker 1>Jose Figueroa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As Fair as administration,</v>

8
00:00:39.721 --> 00:00:43.170
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica puts an end to its military </v>
<v Speaker 1>career and you know what?</v>

9
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.123
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't actually a bad mood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Send the country hasn't had a single </v>

10
00:00:50.831 --> 00:00:52.770
<v Speaker 1>wall or a single key.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

11
00:00:52.771 --> 00:00:56.340
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica can boast about being the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country with the longest,</v>

12
00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.860
<v Speaker 1>uninterrupted period of democratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments in Latin America because Dvo</v>

13
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.833
<v Speaker 1>north again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to the enormous way that the military </v>

14
00:01:03.391 --> 00:01:06.090
<v Speaker 1>boot has traditionally had on last and </v>
<v Speaker 1>American.</v>

15
00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.933
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.113
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the fact that Costa Rica is</v>
<v Speaker 1>located in one of the most violent </v>

17
00:01:10.551 --> 00:01:12.710
<v Speaker 1>regions in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Central America.</v>

18
00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.543
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:18.623
<v Speaker 1>Despite this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this tropical country located between </v>

20
00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.204
<v Speaker 1>the Caribbean sea and the Pacific Ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>has managed to become a middle income </v>

21
00:01:24.301 --> 00:01:27.030
<v Speaker 1>country with quite high levels of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prosperity.</v>

22
00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 1>So what's the recipe here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

23
00:01:28.531 --> 00:01:30.510
<v Speaker 1>prosperity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peace and safety.</v>

24
00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:31.344
<v Speaker 1>These are the ingredients that have made</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica habitually known as the </v>

25
00:01:34.981 --> 00:01:37.200
<v Speaker 1>Switzerland of Latin in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

26
00:01:37.201 --> 00:01:38.034
<v Speaker 1>what is true in all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and in this video we want to tell you a </v>

27
00:01:40.501 --> 00:01:43.170
<v Speaker 1>bit more about Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We want to have a look good.</v>

28
00:01:43.171 --> 00:01:45.390
<v Speaker 1>It's light,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also at its shadows.</v>

29
00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.530
<v Speaker 1>So let's dive in.</v>

30
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.120
<v Speaker 2>Just a happy face,</v>

31
00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.180
<v Speaker 1>however we look at it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica is a very special country.</v>

32
00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.043
<v Speaker 1>Divya,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a country whose </v>

33
00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.240
<v Speaker 1>hallmark color is green because of Costa</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rica is associated with anything.</v>

34
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.103
<v Speaker 1>It's bio diverse.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see with an area that's almost 10 </v>

35
00:02:10.071 --> 00:02:13.380
<v Speaker 1>times smaller than that of Spain or 25 </v>
<v Speaker 1>times smaller than Peru.</v>

36
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:14.263
<v Speaker 1>This country is estimated to have more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than five percent of all the world's </v>

37
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:20.240
<v Speaker 1>animal and plant biodiversity in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

38
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.270
<v Speaker 1>They understand this is not just a sign </v>
<v Speaker 1>of identity,</v>

39
00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:26.690
<v Speaker 1>but also a potentially great competitive</v>
<v Speaker 1>advantage,</v>

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.930
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among other things.</v>

41
00:02:29.931 --> 00:02:30.764
<v Speaker 1>It can help develop a differentiated </v>
<v Speaker 1>tourism industry and position a strong </v>

42
00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.203
<v Speaker 1>country brands that is to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one that gives high value to local </v>

43
00:02:37.731 --> 00:02:39.550
<v Speaker 1>products,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially for international,</v>

44
00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.873
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>

45
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.430
<v Speaker 1>because they wouldn't be willing to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit more for products considered to be</v>

46
00:02:45.431 --> 00:02:49.840
<v Speaker 1>produced cleanly in an environmental </v>
<v Speaker 1>haven and Costa Rica and while they take</v>

47
00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:52.690
<v Speaker 1>these policies very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very seriously,</v>

48
00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.553
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica strives to be an ecological </v>
<v Speaker 1>power is it absolutely is more than 25 </v>

49
00:03:00.311 --> 00:03:01.144
<v Speaker 1>percent of national territory is </v>
<v Speaker 1>protected and the vast majority of </v>

50
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.040
<v Speaker 1>electricity comes from renewable </v>
<v Speaker 1>sources,</v>

51
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.680
<v Speaker 1>hydroelectric,</v>
<v Speaker 1>geothermal and wind power,</v>

52
00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.573
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica is the only country in the </v>

53
00:03:11.711 --> 00:03:12.544
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man's one of the few in the world that </v>

54
00:03:13.841 --> 00:03:14.674
<v Speaker 1>has managed to reverse deforestation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The territory covered by forests has </v>

55
00:03:18.521 --> 00:03:23.521
<v Speaker 1>increased from 21 percent in 1987 to </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 50 percent in the present.</v>

56
00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.430
<v Speaker 1>The thing that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

57
00:03:28.431 --> 00:03:29.264
<v Speaker 1>they achieved thanks to a curious </v>
<v Speaker 1>payment system for environmental </v>

58
00:03:31.791 --> 00:03:33.830
<v Speaker 1>services.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain this.</v>

59
00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.723
<v Speaker 1>In Costa Rica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a part of the taxes on fuels goes to </v>

60
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.810
<v Speaker 1>funds at Costa Rican forest financing or</v>
<v Speaker 1>funds that pays farm and forest owners.</v>

61
00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:42.663
<v Speaker 1>He wants to join the program voluntarily</v>
<v Speaker 1>to conserve their natural space and </v>

62
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:50.480
<v Speaker 1>implement projects that help strengthen </v>
<v Speaker 1>it and that's not all.</v>

63
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:51.343
<v Speaker 1>Many companies also pay into this fund </v>
<v Speaker 1>to offset their impacts on the </v>

64
00:03:53.871 --> 00:03:54.704
<v Speaker 1>environment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Something like corporate social </v>

65
00:03:56.001 --> 00:03:58.440
<v Speaker 1>responsibility that's promoted by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>states.</v>

66
00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.190
<v Speaker 1>Now I think this leads to a really </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting debate because for some this</v>

67
00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:05.024
<v Speaker 1>policy is a bit of a monstrosity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whereas for others it will be a way of </v>

68
00:04:07.791 --> 00:04:08.624
<v Speaker 1>recognizing the negative externalities </v>
<v Speaker 1>of productive activities such as the </v>

69
00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:12.613
<v Speaker 1>pollution caused by factories and also </v>
<v Speaker 1>of course there's the positive </v>

70
00:04:15.141 --> 00:04:17.300
<v Speaker 1>externalities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All natural areas,</v>

71
00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:19.093
<v Speaker 1>half of our territory is covered by </v>
<v Speaker 1>forest and we have an apple system of </v>

72
00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:22.604
<v Speaker 1>protected areas that not only protect an</v>
<v Speaker 1>important part of the planet's </v>

73
00:04:25.161 --> 00:04:25.994
<v Speaker 1>biodiversity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also sustain important sectors of </v>

74
00:04:28.131 --> 00:04:29.480
<v Speaker 1>our economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As for example,</v>

75
00:04:29.481 --> 00:04:31.310
<v Speaker 1>tourism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Alvarado,</v>

76
00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.290
<v Speaker 1>president of Costa Rica.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Personally,</v>

77
00:04:33.291 --> 00:04:34.124
<v Speaker 1>I believe that if these types of </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiatives are accompanied by policies </v>

78
00:04:36.381 --> 00:04:39.500
<v Speaker 1>that promote the creation of companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>and new types of businesses,</v>

79
00:04:39.501 --> 00:04:42.920
<v Speaker 1>they could be really successful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's leave it open to debate.</v>

80
00:04:42.921 --> 00:04:45.440
<v Speaker 1>You can let us know what you think of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this in the comments,</v>

81
00:04:45.441 --> 00:04:46.580
<v Speaker 1>but now let's move on.</v>

82
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.853
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that this type of political </v>
<v Speaker 1>approach doesn't seem to have been at </v>

83
00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.830
<v Speaker 1>odds with the country's economic growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>since the year 2000.</v>

84
00:04:57.831 --> 00:05:01.910
<v Speaker 1>The Costa Rican economy has grown by </v>
<v Speaker 1>around four percent every year,</v>

85
00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:02.803
<v Speaker 1>which even if it doesn't seem like much </v>
<v Speaker 1>has been a higher average growth rate </v>

86
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.660
<v Speaker 1>than that of the rest of Latin America </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the OACD countries.</v>

87
00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.523
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

88
00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:11.683
<v Speaker 1>and that's not all Costa Rica is </v>
<v Speaker 1>undergoing something similar to what we </v>

89
00:05:13.521 --> 00:05:17.150
<v Speaker 1>saw with New Zealand's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we measure variables besides GDP,</v>

90
00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.190
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we consider life expectancy,</v>

91
00:05:19.191 --> 00:05:21.140
<v Speaker 1>salaries and situation of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>

92
00:05:21.141 --> 00:05:21.974
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think Costa Rica comes out even </v>

93
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.700
<v Speaker 1>better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at the the Gotham prosperity</v>

94
00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:29.534
<v Speaker 1>index and the ranking of countries by </v>
<v Speaker 1>GDP per capita in purchasing power </v>

95
00:05:33.081 --> 00:05:33.914
<v Speaker 1>parity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is taking price differences into </v>

96
00:05:35.661 --> 00:05:38.280
<v Speaker 1>account.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we do,</v>

97
00:05:38.281 --> 00:05:39.114
<v Speaker 1>we'll notice the Costa Rica is GDP per </v>
<v Speaker 1>capita is the sixth laundries didn't </v>

98
00:05:41.971 --> 00:05:43.400
<v Speaker 1>last in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

99
00:05:43.401 --> 00:05:44.760
<v Speaker 1>it's below Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Panama,</v>

100
00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:45.623
<v Speaker 1>Uruguay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina and Mexico and 76 in the </v>

101
00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:49.650
<v Speaker 1>wells.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the global prosperity index,</v>

102
00:05:49.651 --> 00:05:50.484
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rican rises to the 29th place </v>
<v Speaker 1>being the second country in Latin </v>

103
00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:54.773
<v Speaker 1>America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>closely behind,</v>

104
00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:58.763
<v Speaker 1>if you want some clear proof,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the average life expectancy in Costa </v>

105
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:05.150
<v Speaker 1>Rica is the third highest in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>American continents.</v>

106
00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:06.480
<v Speaker 1>Being higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

107
00:06:06.481 --> 00:06:11.481
<v Speaker 1>then the last of the United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica,</v>

108
00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.790
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a prosperous,</v>
<v Speaker 1>peaceful country,</v>

109
00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:21.190
<v Speaker 1>committed to the preservation of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>environment,</v>

110
00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:23.140
<v Speaker 1>which all sounds pretty great,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

111
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.033
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on for a moment because this </v>

112
00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:25.834
<v Speaker 1>country has another face.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica is facing very complicated </v>

113
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:29.943
<v Speaker 1>challenges,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so listen up challenges that threatened </v>

114
00:06:38.491 --> 00:06:39.324
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

115
00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.950
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica is a country that has </v>
<v Speaker 1>achieved great things,</v>

116
00:06:43.951 --> 00:06:46.680
<v Speaker 1>especially if we can pair this with many</v>
<v Speaker 1>of its neighbors.</v>

117
00:06:46.710 --> 00:06:48.660
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right now it's facing political,</v>

118
00:06:48.661 --> 00:06:49.494
<v Speaker 1>economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and social challenges that threaten its </v>

119
00:06:51.091 --> 00:06:52.920
<v Speaker 1>path to prosperity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first one,</v>

120
00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:55.020
<v Speaker 1>clearly it's got a lot to do with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>

121
00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:56.553
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though Costa Rica has had a solid </v>

122
00:06:58.501 --> 00:07:00.630
<v Speaker 1>performance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it still has a long way to go.</v>

123
00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:01.493
<v Speaker 1>Currently its GDP per capita is just </v>
<v Speaker 1>over 40 percent of the average for the </v>

124
00:07:04.890 --> 00:07:05.723
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

125
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:06.593
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

126
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.790
<v Speaker 1>Here's the problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The last government was,</v>

127
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:10.663
<v Speaker 1>how do you want to say it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit irresponsible with their fiscal </v>

128
00:07:12.881 --> 00:07:13.714
<v Speaker 1>policy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which left Costa Rica in a rather </v>

129
00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.070
<v Speaker 1>delicate situation only in the last 10 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

130
00:07:18.071 --> 00:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>The public debt has more than doubled in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of GDP for 2018.</v>

131
00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:23.044
<v Speaker 1>Deficit will approach is seven percent </v>
<v Speaker 1>and one of every $3 of public spending </v>

132
00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:31.590
<v Speaker 1>will go towards paying that debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While in 2008 taxes finance,</v>

133
00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:36.040
<v Speaker 1>70 percent of all central government </v>
<v Speaker 1>expenditures in 2017,</v>

134
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.903
<v Speaker 1>they were only enough to finance 50 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent and the difference had to be </v>

135
00:07:39.401 --> 00:07:42.250
<v Speaker 1>covered with debtedness Jorge corellas </v>
<v Speaker 1>consider.</v>

136
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that seems to be a political consensus.</v>

137
00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:49.840
<v Speaker 1>If the situation doesn't change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica could face several problems,</v>

138
00:07:49.870 --> 00:07:53.360
<v Speaker 1>but mainly focusing on raising taxes </v>
<v Speaker 1>could also be counter productive.</v>

139
00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:54.223
<v Speaker 1>The country's tax on corporate profits </v>
<v Speaker 1>is already one of the highest in the </v>

140
00:07:57.131 --> 00:07:59.020
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not only taxes.</v>

141
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.060
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the cost of electricity and fuel,</v>

142
00:08:01.061 --> 00:08:01.894
<v Speaker 1>which lies in the hands of public </v>
<v Speaker 1>monopolies are among some of the most </v>

143
00:08:04.451 --> 00:08:07.650
<v Speaker 1>expensive in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which obviously affects competitive.</v>

144
00:08:07.740 --> 00:08:08.573
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

145
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.490
<v Speaker 1>increases like these.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The labor participation rates,</v>

146
00:08:17.491 --> 00:08:20.460
<v Speaker 1>the rate of people who work is really </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather low.</v>

147
00:08:20.490 --> 00:08:21.323
<v Speaker 1>The president's call us Alvarado really </v>
<v Speaker 1>needs to open up the economy and allow </v>

148
00:08:24.511 --> 00:08:25.344
<v Speaker 1>competition and if possible,</v>
<v Speaker 1>set apart so that the large public </v>

149
00:08:27.961 --> 00:08:28.794
<v Speaker 1>companies can be shared by Costa Rican.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The second challenge has to do with </v>

150
00:08:37.671 --> 00:08:38.960
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>

151
00:08:38.961 --> 00:08:39.794
<v Speaker 1>violence has grown and loss in a country</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was traditionally very safe and </v>

152
00:08:42.141 --> 00:08:46.190
<v Speaker 1>very quiet and well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This does have a simple explanation.</v>

153
00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:48.980
<v Speaker 1>Drug traffickers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>

154
00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:49.873
<v Speaker 1>As you may already know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>drug traffickers are ravaging a large </v>

155
00:08:52.431 --> 00:08:53.264
<v Speaker 1>parts of Latin America and now they're </v>
<v Speaker 1>trying to extend influence to Costa </v>

156
00:08:56.430 --> 00:08:57.263
<v Speaker 1>Rica,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is a good path for that much and </v>

157
00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:01.960
<v Speaker 1>dice third,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

158
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.180
<v Speaker 1>the third challenge has a lot to do with</v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

159
00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.043
<v Speaker 1>The last elections were a good example </v>
<v Speaker 1>of how radical and populist messages </v>

160
00:09:07.841 --> 00:09:10.430
<v Speaker 1>that targets civil liberties are a great</v>
<v Speaker 1>threat.</v>

161
00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.160
<v Speaker 1>See the first electoral rounds held in </v>
<v Speaker 1>February.</v>

162
00:09:14.161 --> 00:09:14.994
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't one by Carlos Alvarado this by</v>
<v Speaker 1>for Bricio Alvarado and evangelist </v>

163
00:09:18.721 --> 00:09:19.554
<v Speaker 1>pastor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who has a very radical discourse among </v>

164
00:09:21.751 --> 00:09:22.584
<v Speaker 1>his obsessions with pursuing any </v>
<v Speaker 1>societal model that differed from what </v>

165
00:09:25.170 --> 00:09:26.003
<v Speaker 1>he perceived as convenient,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially anything related to equal </v>

166
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:29.784
<v Speaker 1>marriage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course anyone can see what they </v>

167
00:09:30.931 --> 00:09:32.910
<v Speaker 1>want and lead their lives however they </v>
<v Speaker 1>please,</v>

168
00:09:32.911 --> 00:09:33.744
<v Speaker 1>but when a politician wants the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government to keep devoted itself to </v>

169
00:09:35.791 --> 00:09:39.000
<v Speaker 1>religion and persecute those who don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>agree with their life model,</v>

170
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:42.330
<v Speaker 1>it can become really dangerous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is Laura Musca.</v>

171
00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:45.270
<v Speaker 1>Fabrizio Alvarado,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his wife in the middle of their campaign</v>

172
00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:47.910
<v Speaker 1>and don't try and tell me that she's not</v>
<v Speaker 1>scary.</v>

173
00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.010
<v Speaker 1>Generally in the second round,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this evangelical pastor who's speech had</v>

174
00:10:03.011 --> 00:10:05.320
<v Speaker 1>a lot of hatred and varied as a loved </v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered,</v>

175
00:10:05.470 --> 00:10:08.800
<v Speaker 1>a crushing defeat even though he still </v>
<v Speaker 1>won 30 percent of the votes,</v>

176
00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:09.663
<v Speaker 1>but it's this sort of populism that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Costa Rica is going to have to be very </v>

177
00:10:11.741 --> 00:10:13.570
<v Speaker 1>careful within the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's if view.</v>

178
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:14.563
<v Speaker 1>That's kind of the way things are.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Carlos Alvarado has just been elected </v>

179
00:10:18.321 --> 00:10:22.010
<v Speaker 1>president and it's now in his hands to </v>
<v Speaker 1>get Costa Rica back on track.</v>

180
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:22.873
<v Speaker 1>To achieve this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll have to change a lot of things </v>

181
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:25.153
<v Speaker 1>and don't forget that the best way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>fight poverty is by promoting more </v>

182
00:10:27.981 --> 00:10:30.440
<v Speaker 1>dynamic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>open and competitive economies.</v>

183
00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:34.440
<v Speaker 1>Companies are new question going to have</v>
<v Speaker 1>to play a prominent role in order</v>

184
00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:35.333
<v Speaker 2>of this,</v>

185
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.630
<v Speaker 1>but now I see.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think that Costa Rica is?</v>

186
00:10:39.631 --> 00:10:42.660
<v Speaker 1>Green model is one other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>should follow.</v>

187
00:10:42.661 --> 00:10:45.600
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the Costa Rica itself is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>model to follow?</v>

188
00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:46.533
