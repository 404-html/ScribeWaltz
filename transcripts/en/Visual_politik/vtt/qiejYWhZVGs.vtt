1
00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.690
<v Speaker 1>The world's best country if you don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>want to be alone.</v>

2
00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.180
<v Speaker 1>This country has half the population of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the United States,</v>

3
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:17.210
<v Speaker 1>but concentrated in an area the size of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Illinois.</v>

4
00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.210
<v Speaker 1>It is the most densely populated country</v>
<v Speaker 1>on the planet.</v>

5
00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.223
<v Speaker 1>It's also been one of the fastest </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing countries in the last few </v>

6
00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:24.590
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In less than 20 years,</v>

7
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh has cut poverty in half.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Avi Leader in textile manufacturing only</v>

8
00:00:33.811 --> 00:00:35.670
<v Speaker 1>surpassed by China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

9
00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.593
<v Speaker 1>I'm pretty sure your shirt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>your trousers or something else you're </v>

10
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:39.174
<v Speaker 1>wearing right now was made bath.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's wait a minute because it is still </v>

11
00:00:41.971 --> 00:00:44.520
<v Speaker 1>too soon to open the bottle of </v>
<v Speaker 1>champagne.</v>

12
00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.140
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh grows faster,</v>

13
00:00:46.141 --> 00:00:46.974
<v Speaker 1>but still to date,</v>
<v Speaker 1>13 percent of their population lives on </v>

14
00:00:49.441 --> 00:00:54.270
<v Speaker 1>less than $2 a day and that's 20 million</v>
<v Speaker 1>people add to this.</v>

15
00:00:54.271 --> 00:00:55.104
<v Speaker 1>The fact that Islam is the main religion</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the country and you get headlines </v>

16
00:00:58.231 --> 00:00:59.160
<v Speaker 1>like this one</v>

17
00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:05.530
<v Speaker 1>activity increased in Bangladesh in </v>
<v Speaker 1>2016.</v>

18
00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.423
<v Speaker 1>I made global fall and attacks dislike </v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that Bangladesh has a secular </v>

19
00:01:09.461 --> 00:01:10.294
<v Speaker 1>constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Adulterous women are stoned to death in </v>

20
00:01:12.371 --> 00:01:13.204
<v Speaker 1>some regions and 80 percent of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>population agrees with changing the </v>

21
00:01:16.241 --> 00:01:17.074
<v Speaker 1>legislation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that it meets the principles of </v>

22
00:01:18.611 --> 00:01:19.930
<v Speaker 1>Sharia law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>

23
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.120
<v Speaker 1>despite the radicalization of some </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens,</v>

24
00:01:22.121 --> 00:01:25.930
<v Speaker 1>the prime minister shake of Ciena is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>woman and the opposition leader,</v>

25
00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:30.310
<v Speaker 1>a leader is also a woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the situation that is far from quiet,</v>

26
00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:34.930
<v Speaker 1>especially given that in the next year,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2018 Bangladesh will hold elections that</v>

27
00:01:34.931 --> 00:01:37.420
<v Speaker 1>might be crucial for the future of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

28
00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.320
<v Speaker 1>Questions that we find ourselves asking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oh well Ken Bangladesh become an Islamic</v>

29
00:01:46.321 --> 00:01:47.154
<v Speaker 1>republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And why do we think Bangladesh is a </v>

30
00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>demographic time bomb?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

31
00:01:51.001 --> 00:01:52.680
<v Speaker 1>today we are going to answer these </v>
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>

32
00:01:52.681 --> 00:01:56.010
<v Speaker 1>but before we do that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look back out the history.</v>

33
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.470
<v Speaker 1>One Country to families and 1947,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the British empire,</v>

34
00:02:04.471 --> 00:02:06.990
<v Speaker 1>let's the Indian colonies become </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence.</v>

35
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.003
<v Speaker 1>The parts were Hindu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't was the main religion became what </v>

36
00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:11.130
<v Speaker 1>today is known as</v>

37
00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.333
<v Speaker 2>dm</v>

38
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.600
<v Speaker 1>with an Islamic majority became </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

39
00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.300
<v Speaker 1>but things are not as simple as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>seem.</v>

40
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.510
<v Speaker 1>The listening pause ended up divided </v>
<v Speaker 1>into two parts.</v>

41
00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:24.463
<v Speaker 1>As you can see on the screen now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India was in the middle and to the left </v>

42
00:02:26.751 --> 00:02:29.660
<v Speaker 1>and right there was Pakistan with a </v>
<v Speaker 1>political system.</v>

43
00:02:29.661 --> 00:02:32.480
<v Speaker 1>Based on sharia law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2,200 kilometers divided,</v>

44
00:02:32.481 --> 00:02:34.700
<v Speaker 1>these two paths that belonged to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same states,</v>

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this just didn't work very well.</v>

46
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.433
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>putting aside the fact that they have </v>

47
00:02:40.401 --> 00:02:42.260
<v Speaker 1>the same religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two paths,</v>

48
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.153
<v Speaker 1>while they had nothing in common,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they didn't even speak the same </v>

49
00:02:45.321 --> 00:02:46.154
<v Speaker 1>language.</v>

50
00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.130
<v Speaker 2>Western Pakistanis</v>

51
00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.400
<v Speaker 1>despise the eastern Pakistanis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>also known as the Bengalis and wanted to</v>

52
00:02:55.401 --> 00:02:57.890
<v Speaker 1>have their own country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So in 1971,</v>

53
00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.950
<v Speaker 1>the liberation war starting estimation </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that somewhere between 300,000 and 3</v>

54
00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.710
<v Speaker 1>million civilians died in the sport,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as a result of brand new country,</v>

55
00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:14.340
<v Speaker 1>I was born and this was the People's </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic of Bangladesh.</v>

56
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.610
<v Speaker 1>This is also how Mujtaba Rahman,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or as they know him,</v>

57
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.583
<v Speaker 1>Bunka Bonduelle became the first </v>
<v Speaker 1>president since Pakistan was an Islamic </v>

58
00:03:21.841 --> 00:03:24.720
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Bangladesh hated Pakistan badly.</v>

59
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.683
<v Speaker 1>Bangor then do you designed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>constitution that was completely </v>

60
00:03:28.591 --> 00:03:29.790
<v Speaker 1>secular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.653
<v Speaker 1>they followed the ideological fashion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>the time or the so called Arab </v>

62
00:03:33.721 --> 00:03:34.554
<v Speaker 1>socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This wasn't ideological cocktail that </v>

63
00:03:36.661 --> 00:03:40.750
<v Speaker 1>combines authoritarian leaders,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a centralized economy and secularism.</v>

64
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:47.403
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just a minute here because it really </v>

65
00:03:47.921 --> 00:03:48.754
<v Speaker 1>wasn't that easy for years later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bangor bands zoo and this whole family </v>

66
00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:54.480
<v Speaker 1>died and acute atar made by those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported Pakistan.</v>

67
00:03:54.481 --> 00:03:58.850
<v Speaker 1>You rule during the liberation war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only his two daughters survived.</v>

68
00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.830
<v Speaker 1>One of them shake a Siena is the current</v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister,</v>

69
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:02.773
<v Speaker 1>but let's look back at that cue to top </v>
<v Speaker 1>after two years of political stability </v>

70
00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:10.490
<v Speaker 1>in the influence of the CIA General Zia </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rahman became the man in China.</v>

71
00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:11.403
<v Speaker 2>Sure</v>

72
00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:16.773
<v Speaker 1>that his most controversial decisions </v>
<v Speaker 1>was to give amnesty to the pro </v>

73
00:04:19.241 --> 00:04:20.074
<v Speaker 1>Pakistani.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore Islam as soldiers who killed </v>

74
00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:23.343
<v Speaker 1>Banga Bantu.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how the big ideological divide </v>

75
00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.210
<v Speaker 1>was created in Bangladesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

76
00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:30.760
<v Speaker 1>we have the family and the political </v>
<v Speaker 1>party of General Ramen.</v>

77
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:35.410
<v Speaker 1>The BNP or Bangladesh National Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are a conservative coalition with a</v>

78
00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:36.244
<v Speaker 1>strong presence among isn't Mr parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of those who participated in the </v>

79
00:04:39.481 --> 00:04:43.390
<v Speaker 1>cute Atar.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 1975 became members of the BNP party.</v>

80
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.150
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have the party of Bangor Bansi,</v>

81
00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.043
<v Speaker 1>the circled Awami League.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are considered socialist and </v>

82
00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.140
<v Speaker 1>secular.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Romans rule the country for four years.</v>

83
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.560
<v Speaker 1>Then of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>then another cute Atar,</v>

84
00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:02.523
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh was ruled by the military </v>
<v Speaker 1>until 1991 when democracy came back to </v>

85
00:05:06.161 --> 00:05:08.410
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute again here,</v>

86
00:05:08.411 --> 00:05:09.244
<v Speaker 1>because the Bangladesh way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if democracy is pretty far from </v>

87
00:05:12.341 --> 00:05:17.341
<v Speaker 1>democratic tree to women since 1991,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these two political parties had two main</v>

88
00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:23.760
<v Speaker 1>leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the BNP side,</v>

89
00:05:23.761 --> 00:05:26.760
<v Speaker 1>we have Kalita Zen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the widow desire ramen.</v>

90
00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:30.660
<v Speaker 1>On the army side there is shake Asina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the daughter of Ngabantu.</v>

91
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:31.553
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections have been a fight between two </v>

92
00:05:33.061 --> 00:05:35.970
<v Speaker 1>women.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This alternate empower every five years.</v>

93
00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 1>Neither one of them can win the </v>
<v Speaker 1>elections consistently.</v>

94
00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.220
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>elections in Bangladesh,</v>

95
00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:42.343
<v Speaker 1>absolutely.</v>

96
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.283
<v Speaker 2>Hello,</v>

97
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.210
<v Speaker 1>the opposition party organizers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>violence protests and paralyzing strikes</v>

98
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:52.470
<v Speaker 1>that damage to the country,</v>

99
00:05:56.370 --> 00:05:58.020
<v Speaker 2>but in 2006 well</v>

100
00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 1>things they changed back then.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Awami League,</v>

101
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:04.520
<v Speaker 1>leds by shake Asina disagreed with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>way that they organize the elections.</v>

102
00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.230
<v Speaker 1>This was pretty business as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this time the military tried to make</v>

103
00:06:09.231 --> 00:06:09.980
<v Speaker 1>a cute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's odd,</v>

104
00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:10.813
<v Speaker 1>but some audit in the country like they </v>
<v Speaker 1>had in the 19 eighties elections had to </v>

105
00:06:13.971 --> 00:06:18.320
<v Speaker 1>be postponed for two years and finally </v>
<v Speaker 1>sheet casinos won the elections.</v>

106
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:20.210
<v Speaker 1>In that moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I learned a lesson.</v>

107
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.820
<v Speaker 1>The important thing is not winning the </v>
<v Speaker 1>office.</v>

108
00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.953
<v Speaker 2>Keeping</v>

109
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:27.673
<v Speaker 1>not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Remember when I told you the general </v>

110
00:06:28.251 --> 00:06:29.084
<v Speaker 1>robin gave amnesty to those.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You've killed Banga Bendu 40 years </v>

111
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:32.240
<v Speaker 1>before.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

112
00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:33.103
<v Speaker 1>his daughter shake Kasina had a pretty </v>
<v Speaker 1>good memory and she took those memories </v>

113
00:06:36.891 --> 00:06:40.110
<v Speaker 1>from the past and decided to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>something about those Islamists.</v>

114
00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.953
<v Speaker 1>He might challenge power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those who participated in the 1975 at a </v>

115
00:06:44.241 --> 00:06:49.241
<v Speaker 1>time executes leader of largest Islamist</v>
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>

116
00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:53.420
<v Speaker 1>If this wasn't enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she broke up.</v>

117
00:06:53.421 --> 00:06:54.254
<v Speaker 1>Uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest political traditions </v>

118
00:06:55.491 --> 00:06:58.130
<v Speaker 1>in Bangladesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Usually during an election,</v>

119
00:06:58.131 --> 00:06:58.964
<v Speaker 1>the parliaments would create a neutral </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments in order to guarantee a </v>

120
00:07:01.401 --> 00:07:05.360
<v Speaker 1>clean and fair process was not willing </v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave power.</v>

121
00:07:05.361 --> 00:07:06.194
<v Speaker 1>The opposition boycotted the elections </v>
<v Speaker 1>and to Siena one with 79 percent of the </v>

122
00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:10.013
<v Speaker 1>vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When ash ruling party wins after </v>

123
00:07:15.021 --> 00:07:18.350
<v Speaker 1>boycotted vote.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't have the words now in 2017.</v>

124
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:21.650
<v Speaker 1>Shake a scene or is the strongest leader</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Bangladesh's history,</v>

125
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:22.573
<v Speaker 1>and this is no little thing if we </v>
<v Speaker 1>remember that this is a country of more </v>

126
00:07:24.921 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>than 160 million inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question is now,</v>

127
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.450
<v Speaker 1>is there anyone who can match a scene as</v>
<v Speaker 1>power?</v>

128
00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:34.940
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is actually yes.</v>

129
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:39.913
<v Speaker 1>Graphic bomb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we said at the beginning of the 20 </v>

130
00:07:42.470 --> 00:07:44.960
<v Speaker 1>million Bangladeshi citizens live in </v>
<v Speaker 1>extreme poverty.</v>

131
00:07:45.110 --> 00:07:48.290
<v Speaker 1>They are young and extremely religious.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

132
00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:51.740
<v Speaker 1>they are the perfect market for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>radical Islamist movements.</v>

133
00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:53.930
<v Speaker 1>And Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know you might be saying right now,</v>

134
00:07:53.931 --> 00:07:54.321
<v Speaker 1>but.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

135
00:07:54.321 --> 00:07:57.740
<v Speaker 1>Simon did not say that Bangladesh is one</v>
<v Speaker 1>of the fastest growing countries.</v>

136
00:07:58.010 --> 00:07:58.880
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes I did.</v>

137
00:07:58.881 --> 00:08:01.550
<v Speaker 1>And this is exactly why there's 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million poor citizens</v>

138
00:08:02.270 --> 00:08:03.103
<v Speaker 2>problem.</v>

139
00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:11.423
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if you want to start the populist </v>

140
00:08:12.091 --> 00:08:14.730
<v Speaker 1>revolution never go to an extremely poor</v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

141
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:15.623
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the radical movements appear </v>

142
00:08:16.981 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 1>when countries are starting to grow or </v>
<v Speaker 1>stepping out of a crisis.</v>

143
00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:21.503
<v Speaker 1>This is your window of opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is the moment when the worst off </v>

144
00:08:23.851 --> 00:08:28.080
<v Speaker 1>citizens can feel jealous of those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are getting wealthier and wealthier.</v>

145
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:32.850
<v Speaker 1>Those $20 million impoverished citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>are imperfect targets for radicalization</v>

146
00:08:33.090 --> 00:08:35.760
<v Speaker 1>and it can be a real threats to our </v>
<v Speaker 1>country stability.</v>

147
00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:36.893
<v Speaker 1>This is why it terrorist attacks have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been getting more and more frequent in </v>

148
00:08:39.571 --> 00:08:44.571
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh since 2013.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The victims are bloggers who claim to be</v>

149
00:08:48.481 --> 00:08:51.240
<v Speaker 1>atheists and trying to spread secularism</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the country.</v>

150
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.030
<v Speaker 1>That's the real wakeup call that came </v>
<v Speaker 1>in.</v>

151
00:08:54.031 --> 00:08:59.031
<v Speaker 1>Two Thousand and 16 long letter should </v>
<v Speaker 1>attack isis.</v>

152
00:09:02.211 --> 00:09:03.044
<v Speaker 1>Gunmen killed at least 22 people in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>hostage crisis at Daca restaurant since </v>

153
00:09:06.561 --> 00:09:09.170
<v Speaker 1>then shake us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>INA has been trying to stop terrorism.</v>

154
00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.950
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I said in 2018 elections will be held</v>

155
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:16.940
<v Speaker 1>and the government is trying to gain </v>
<v Speaker 1>support from that religious population.</v>

156
00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:17.953
<v Speaker 1>This is why it has seen isn't letting </v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia invest $1,000,000,000 into </v>

157
00:09:20.931 --> 00:09:23.960
<v Speaker 1>the building of 160 mosques throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country.</v>

158
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:24.853
<v Speaker 1>At the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she is making it harder for women's who </v>

159
00:09:26.151 --> 00:09:30.450
<v Speaker 1>inherits money and also making it easier</v>
<v Speaker 1>for young girls to marry much older.</v>

160
00:09:30.451 --> 00:09:30.800
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

161
00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:31.633
<v Speaker 2>Amen.</v>

162
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.440
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't stop there and Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>propaganda group because half is that he</v>

163
00:09:44.441 --> 00:09:47.510
<v Speaker 1>Islam send their agenda with political </v>
<v Speaker 1>suggestions.</v>

164
00:09:47.511 --> 00:09:49.280
<v Speaker 1>Do you have governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for instance,</v>

165
00:09:49.281 --> 00:09:53.240
<v Speaker 1>they wanted the religious teachings </v>
<v Speaker 1>given a radical mosques to be considered</v>

166
00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:54.074
<v Speaker 1>at the same level as any academic </v>
<v Speaker 1>institution and against the odds shake </v>

167
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.880
<v Speaker 1>Hasina has accepted that as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>other proposals from the radicals.</v>

168
00:10:01.950 --> 00:10:02.783
<v Speaker 1>Don't forget that she and her party are </v>
<v Speaker 1>the ones that stands for secular values </v>

169
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:08.390
<v Speaker 1>against a more traditional approach from</v>
<v Speaker 1>the BNP party.</v>

170
00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:18.360
<v Speaker 1>So this leads us to the big question </v>
<v Speaker 1>here.</v>

171
00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:22.770
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Bangladesh is at risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a de facto Islamic republic,</v>

172
00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.693
<v Speaker 1>or is this just a political game?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sheik Hasina to strengthen her power </v>

173
00:10:26.790 --> 00:10:28.190
<v Speaker 1>before the elections?</v>
