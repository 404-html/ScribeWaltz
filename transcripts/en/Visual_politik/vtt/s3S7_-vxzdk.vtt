<v Speaker 1>[inaudible].</v>

2
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.640
<v Speaker 2>I think the national media coverage of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela increases.</v>

3
00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.563
<v Speaker 2>It seems as if they're national media </v>
<v Speaker 2>coverage of their own country is </v>

4
00:00:13.301 --> 00:00:14.134
<v Speaker 2>actually decreasing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the time we were preparing this </v>

5
00:00:15.731 --> 00:00:18.220
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we had a look at the website of Telesur,</v>

6
00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:21.220
<v Speaker 2>one of their largest state owned </v>
<v Speaker 2>television networks.</v>

7
00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:22.203
<v Speaker 2>On the main page there,</v>
<v Speaker 2>29 headlines and just six of them were </v>

8
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.180
<v Speaker 2>talking about their own country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite what this looks like on the face</v>

9
00:00:28.181 --> 00:00:29.014
<v Speaker 2>of things though,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this couldn't actually resemble any </v>

10
00:00:30.701 --> 00:00:33.400
<v Speaker 2>better what is actually happening in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela</v>

11
00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:35.583
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

12
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.173
<v Speaker 2>there is no one who denies that the </v>
<v Speaker 2>South American country is going through </v>

13
00:00:40.821 --> 00:00:45.320
<v Speaker 2>one of the worst humanitarian crises </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the entire continent has ever seen.</v>

14
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.530
<v Speaker 2>According to a study run by three </v>
<v Speaker 2>universities from this country,</v>

15
00:00:48.531 --> 00:00:49.364
<v Speaker 2>the average Venezuelan ways between nine</v>
<v Speaker 2>and 10 kilos less than two years ago </v>

16
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.893
<v Speaker 2>when the food shortages began.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now the big question is how much blame </v>

17
00:00:56.601 --> 00:01:00.020
<v Speaker 2>should be apportioned to the Venezuelan </v>
<v Speaker 2>President Nicolas Maduro?</v>

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.750
<v Speaker 2>This is where people have rather </v>
<v Speaker 2>difference opinion.</v>

19
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.113
<v Speaker 2>Too many political analysts,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela is not a democratic nation </v>

20
00:01:10.941 --> 00:01:11.774
<v Speaker 2>anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Things like the president's attempt to </v>

21
00:01:12.921 --> 00:01:13.754
<v Speaker 2>dissolve the parliament or jailing </v>
<v Speaker 2>politicians from the opposition have </v>

22
00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:21.581
<v Speaker 2>triggered the diplomatic crises at the </v>
<v Speaker 2>highest level in at Adidas retires their</v>

23
00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:25.280
<v Speaker 2>ambassador in Venezuela with the support</v>
<v Speaker 2>of their parliament.</v>

24
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:26.203
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are others who still play in </v>

25
00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:30.580
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela is a democracy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They even seen Nicolas Maduro.</v>

26
00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.350
<v Speaker 2>The president's is defending himself </v>
<v Speaker 2>from acute to tar.</v>

27
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.260
<v Speaker 2>So the question is here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is right?</v>

28
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.243
<v Speaker 2>Can we say the Venezuela is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorship or is there's something of </v>

29
00:01:40.251 --> 00:01:43.070
<v Speaker 2>an exaggeration they,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're going to answer this question,</v>

30
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.963
<v Speaker 2>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's check out the story of Nicolas </v>

31
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:47.630
<v Speaker 2>Maduro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bent is government</v>

32
00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.990
<v Speaker 2>is preparing a coup d'etat according to </v>
<v Speaker 2>Madurai.</v>

33
00:01:52.991 --> 00:01:57.550
<v Speaker 2>The Venezuelan crisis can be summarized </v>
<v Speaker 2>as a conspiracy by the United States and</v>

34
00:01:57.551 --> 00:01:58.384
<v Speaker 2>that allies to destroy the Bolivarian </v>
<v Speaker 2>Revolution and the so called 21st </v>

35
00:02:02.201 --> 00:02:04.880
<v Speaker 2>century socialism,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they elite Imperioli,</v>

36
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.743
<v Speaker 2>purest elite despises our people and </v>
<v Speaker 2>have the goal of destroying our </v>

37
00:02:10.061 --> 00:02:12.040
<v Speaker 2>lifestyle,</v>
<v Speaker 2>our democracy,</v>

38
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.500
<v Speaker 2>our independence,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and our homeland.</v>

39
00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 2>They have decided to trigger plans to </v>
<v Speaker 2>destabilize the Venezuelan society.</v>

40
00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.340
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so there's an La,</v>

41
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:21.173
<v Speaker 2>I know you're probably thinking,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but let's just imagine for a quick </v>

42
00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.710
<v Speaker 2>amendment that that theory actually make</v>
<v Speaker 2>some kind of sense.</v>

43
00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.050
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the imperialists delete.</v>

44
00:02:29.051 --> 00:02:32.440
<v Speaker 2>I'll not only trying to dismantle the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuelan economy,</v>

45
00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.520
<v Speaker 2>but also their governments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is what explains Nicolas Maduro</v>

46
00:02:36.521 --> 00:02:37.354
<v Speaker 2>is fear of a coop.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hold on for just a moment because </v>

47
00:02:39.371 --> 00:02:40.204
<v Speaker 2>before we continue,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we should explain what acu actually </v>

48
00:02:42.671 --> 00:02:43.630
<v Speaker 2>means.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

49
00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:44.464
<v Speaker 2>Acute Atar is defined as the taking of </v>
<v Speaker 2>power in a sudden and violent action </v>

50
00:02:48.311 --> 00:02:51.010
<v Speaker 2>carried out by a powerful group like the</v>
<v Speaker 2>army.</v>

51
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.210
<v Speaker 2>And surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise,</v>

52
00:02:52.211 --> 00:02:56.160
<v Speaker 2>the Venezuelan army is absolutely loyal </v>
<v Speaker 2>to Nicolas Maduro.</v>

53
00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.763
<v Speaker 2>Father of the Bolivarian Revolution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hugo Chavez used to be a member of the </v>

54
00:03:05.921 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 2>military.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unlike other countries like the UK where</v>

55
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 2>it is forbidden by law for soldiers to </v>
<v Speaker 2>run for office in Venezuela,</v>

56
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:15.250
<v Speaker 2>there are several ministers that come </v>
<v Speaker 2>from the armed forces air.</v>

57
00:03:15.251 --> 00:03:16.720
<v Speaker 2>We have left tenants,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Melendez,</v>

58
00:03:16.721 --> 00:03:20.270
<v Speaker 2>revise the president's chief of staff or</v>
<v Speaker 2>the General Marco Reavers,</v>

59
00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:21.123
<v Speaker 2>the Minister of foods.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Actually one third of Maduro has </v>

60
00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.300
<v Speaker 2>governments comes from the military.</v>

61
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.050
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

62
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.140
<v Speaker 2>being said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who could successfully conduct a coup in</v>

63
00:03:34.141 --> 00:03:36.750
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela according to moderate?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

64
00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:40.590
<v Speaker 2>as the amount of gas do you suggest is </v>
<v Speaker 2>this would be his political opponents.</v>

65
00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.040
<v Speaker 2>There's only one problem with this </v>
<v Speaker 2>theory though.</v>

66
00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.340
<v Speaker 2>Not one of them has any relationship </v>
<v Speaker 2>whatsoever with the military.</v>

67
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:49.174
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>People like on Enrique Katrina's or </v>

68
00:03:50.401 --> 00:03:51.234
<v Speaker 2>Leopoldo Lopez or any of the other </v>
<v Speaker 2>opposition leaders are professional </v>

69
00:03:54.291 --> 00:03:55.124
<v Speaker 2>politicians or former businessmen and </v>
<v Speaker 2>they have no military group supporting </v>

70
00:03:58.791 --> 00:04:00.110
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Despite all of this,</v>

71
00:04:00.111 --> 00:04:02.690
<v Speaker 2>the government keeps saying that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>these politicians,</v>

72
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:03.533
<v Speaker 2>all the real instigators of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>street violence and live in a country </v>

73
00:04:12.511 --> 00:04:16.020
<v Speaker 2>where people need a full day's wages to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get a bag of onions.</v>

74
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:20.070
<v Speaker 2>It's absolutely normal that people would</v>
<v Speaker 2>want to organize demonstrations.</v>

75
00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.060
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and to add to this,</v>

76
00:04:21.061 --> 00:04:24.390
<v Speaker 2>the fact that Caracas is the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>violent city in all of Latin America,</v>

77
00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:28.500
<v Speaker 2>and as you'll probably understand why </v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the protests send up like that.</v>

78
00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:33.501
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

79
00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>according to the government of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela,</v>

80
00:04:36.871 --> 00:04:37.704
<v Speaker 2>the clashes between the police and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protestors are nothing but the outcome </v>

81
00:04:40.411 --> 00:04:41.244
<v Speaker 2>of bourgeoisie propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why in September of 2015 three </v>

82
00:04:45.301 --> 00:04:47.460
<v Speaker 2>months before having parliamentary </v>
<v Speaker 2>elections,</v>

83
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.530
<v Speaker 2>the Venezuelan police arrested Leopoldo </v>
<v Speaker 2>Lopez,</v>

84
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.383
<v Speaker 2>one of the opposition leaders.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The prosecutor claims that this man was </v>

85
00:04:53.911 --> 00:04:57.310
<v Speaker 2>inciting people into violence with these</v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of statements made on</v>

86
00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.253
<v Speaker 1>what's that</v>

87
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.480
<v Speaker 2>guts to take me to prison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Are you waiting for orders from Havana?</v>

88
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.900
<v Speaker 2>I'm telling you the truth is on our </v>
<v Speaker 2>side,</v>

89
00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:12.580
<v Speaker 1>but</v>

90
00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:13.413
<v Speaker 2>the turning points would come later in </v>
<v Speaker 2>December of 2015 at this time at </v>

91
00:05:17.251 --> 00:05:18.084
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela has parliamentary elections,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you can imagine that the </v>

92
00:05:20.921 --> 00:05:25.090
<v Speaker 2>opposition party is unified in the so </v>
<v Speaker 2>called Table of Democratic Unity,</v>

93
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:30.240
<v Speaker 2>Aka the mud beats him do a rose party by</v>
<v Speaker 2>over 2 million votes.</v>

94
00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.413
<v Speaker 2>The president's reaction was actually </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you'd expect from every democratic </v>

95
00:05:33.941 --> 00:05:38.260
<v Speaker 2>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Recognize this outcome.</v>

96
00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.153
<v Speaker 2>Even if we don't like it,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we accept it and we say that democracy </v>

97
00:05:43.571 --> 00:05:46.180
<v Speaker 2>and the constitution or the real winners</v>
<v Speaker 2>here,</v>

98
00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:51.250
<v Speaker 2>hold on for just a moment because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>is when the problem starts.</v>

99
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.293
<v Speaker 2>This brands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>new nt government parliament started </v>

100
00:05:54.101 --> 00:05:57.770
<v Speaker 2>trying to impeach the president and this</v>
<v Speaker 2>is where all of a sudden,</v>

101
00:05:57.771 --> 00:06:00.860
<v Speaker 2>but during and his ministers made a </v>
<v Speaker 2>radical shift.</v>

102
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:03.613
<v Speaker 2>Economic war has influenced a big share </v>
<v Speaker 2>of our population and this turned the </v>

103
00:06:07.971 --> 00:06:09.730
<v Speaker 2>public opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During this time,</v>

104
00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:10.583
<v Speaker 2>Nicolas and the dirt road tried to </v>
<v Speaker 2>dissolve parliament according to his </v>

105
00:06:12.861 --> 00:06:13.280
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

106
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:14.113
<v Speaker 2>Some of those mps had been elected by </v>
<v Speaker 2>cheating in the electoral process and </v>

107
00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:20.990
<v Speaker 2>not even the supreme court in Venezuela </v>
<v Speaker 2>excepted this version.</v>

108
00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:26.200
<v Speaker 2>This is why on May the first 2017 maduro</v>
<v Speaker 2>made his final decision draw,</v>

109
00:06:31.790 --> 00:06:34.910
<v Speaker 2>calling up the constitutional power to </v>
<v Speaker 2>get the piece.</v>

110
00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.833
<v Speaker 2>This republic needs to beat the fascist </v>
<v Speaker 2>coup and let the people bring the </v>

111
00:06:40.161 --> 00:06:43.160
<v Speaker 2>harmony and the actual national </v>
<v Speaker 2>dialogue.</v>

112
00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.233
<v Speaker 2>And otherwise my delray wants a new </v>
<v Speaker 2>parliament and writing brands new </v>

113
00:06:46.341 --> 00:06:49.700
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would give him unlimited power and</v>

114
00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:53.180
<v Speaker 2>this would be the ultimate step for </v>
<v Speaker 2>creating a dictatorship.</v>

115
00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.090
<v Speaker 2>And does he might.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well now one's Ed.</v>

116
00:06:55.160 --> 00:07:00.160
<v Speaker 2>Is this going to be through an election?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

117
00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:03.450
<v Speaker 2>theoretically,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

118
00:07:03.451 --> 00:07:04.284
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that since 2015 there </v>
<v Speaker 2>are lots of opposition leaders behind </v>

119
00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:09.330
<v Speaker 2>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And so,</v>

120
00:07:09.331 --> 00:07:10.530
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what about the media?</v>

121
00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.590
<v Speaker 2>Badori supporters say that Venezuela has</v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech,</v>

122
00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:15.960
<v Speaker 2>but is this really true?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

123
00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.990
<v Speaker 2>let's have a look at that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their freedom of speech in Venezuela,</v>

124
00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.480
<v Speaker 2>according to the Curran's Venezuelan </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution,</v>

125
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.940
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech is a fundamental </v>
<v Speaker 2>right.</v>

126
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:28.803
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are many newspapers who opposed </v>

127
00:07:30.211 --> 00:07:31.044
<v Speaker 2>then you've governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But guess what the problem these </v>

128
00:07:32.681 --> 00:07:33.514
<v Speaker 2>newspapers have is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well they don't actually have any paper </v>

129
00:07:35.801 --> 00:07:37.540
<v Speaker 2>on which to print their new</v>

130
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:45.490
<v Speaker 2>just like that in Venezuela paper is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>monopoly regulated by the state.</v>

131
00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:48.320
<v Speaker 2>And this is why gay media outlets like </v>
<v Speaker 2>El now cnl,</v>

132
00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.520
<v Speaker 2>which is contrary to Maduro,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to reduce their circulation.</v>

133
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:52.533
<v Speaker 2>And even the number of pages in their </v>
<v Speaker 2>newspaper other day lease of had to </v>

134
00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:58.540
<v Speaker 2>become weeklies because they couldn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>print so many papers.</v>

135
00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:01.120
<v Speaker 2>And now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well what about the incident?</v>

136
00:08:01.121 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 2>I mean who even reads print papers </v>
<v Speaker 2>anymore?</v>

137
00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.293
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately maduro and is governments </v>

138
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:08.290
<v Speaker 2>have absolute power to block any </v>
<v Speaker 2>website.</v>

139
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.350
<v Speaker 2>Have you ever heard of the site?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically this is a site where you could</v>

140
00:08:11.351 --> 00:08:13.390
<v Speaker 2>put the link for any page and it makes </v>
<v Speaker 2>it shorter.</v>

141
00:08:13.391 --> 00:08:16.860
<v Speaker 2>So you can tweet it easily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Does it sound counterrevolution reading?</v>

142
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.400
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>check this out.</v>

143
00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:23.600
<v Speaker 2>Leave shortcuts are banned in Venezuela.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>

144
00:08:23.601 --> 00:08:24.434
<v Speaker 2>if Britney is forbid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>an other critical websites like CNN </v>

145
00:08:26.781 --> 00:08:30.110
<v Speaker 2>dollars a day or info bae up or say </v>
<v Speaker 2>bands.</v>

146
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:32.690
<v Speaker 2>If you live in Venezuela and you want to</v>
<v Speaker 2>visit these websites,</v>

147
00:08:32.691 --> 00:08:35.570
<v Speaker 2>you must do it through a proxy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just like in China.</v>

148
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.553
<v Speaker 2>And of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget that there have been more </v>

149
00:08:37.431 --> 00:08:41.570
<v Speaker 2>than 40 journalists threatened by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government's allies or even worse,</v>

150
00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:44.430
<v Speaker 1>six</v>

151
00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:49.200
<v Speaker 2>twitter users are in jail in Venezuela </v>
<v Speaker 2>for giving their political opinions.</v>

152
00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:49.830
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

153
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:52.470
<v Speaker 2>that rights they on knots being judged </v>
<v Speaker 2>or fines.</v>

154
00:08:52.471 --> 00:08:53.304
<v Speaker 2>They are in prison.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But hold on for just minute because all </v>

155
00:08:55.891 --> 00:08:59.330
<v Speaker 2>of this is nothing compared to what's </v>
<v Speaker 2>happening in television.</v>

156
00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:00.293
<v Speaker 2>And you got to call me for decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Caracas was the Hollywood of South </v>

157
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.343
<v Speaker 2>American soap operas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela was famous for having lots of </v>

158
00:09:09.691 --> 00:09:12.780
<v Speaker 2>private TV stations.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And of course some of them were contrary</v>

159
00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:16.440
<v Speaker 2>to Madurai as governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Venezuelan Constitution provides for</v>

160
00:09:16.441 --> 00:09:18.970
<v Speaker 2>freedom of speech on tv,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but on the other hands,</v>

161
00:09:19.010 --> 00:09:19.843
<v Speaker 2>the law of forces them to broadcast all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the president's speeches and we're </v>

162
00:09:22.981 --> 00:09:23.814
<v Speaker 2>not talking about one show a year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Maduro appears on TV several times a </v>

163
00:09:27.631 --> 00:09:28.464
<v Speaker 2>week and the TVS have to make a break </v>
<v Speaker 2>matter their schedule and broadcast the </v>

164
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:33.414
<v Speaker 2>presidential speech.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes these speeches can last for </v>

165
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:39.030
<v Speaker 2>hours and add to this other stories like</v>
<v Speaker 2>this one.</v>

166
00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:45.950
<v Speaker 2>No bovie Xian,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a Venezuelan TV broadcaster is sold to a</v>

167
00:09:45.951 --> 00:09:49.670
<v Speaker 2>new owner who promises a new,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more moderate ideology.</v>

168
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Before medallia was the president's </v>
<v Speaker 2>during the times of Hugo Chavez glade,</v>

169
00:09:53.210 --> 00:09:56.780
<v Speaker 2>the vision was a diehard antigovernment </v>
<v Speaker 2>TV station,</v>

170
00:09:57.020 --> 00:09:57.853
<v Speaker 2>but all of a sudden it was sold in 2013 </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the new owners had close ties with </v>

171
00:10:01.101 --> 00:10:01.934
<v Speaker 2>the presidents.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the first thing they did when they </v>

172
00:10:03.591 --> 00:10:04.424
<v Speaker 2>took control of the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was to fire half of the staff and </v>

173
00:10:07.011 --> 00:10:07.844
<v Speaker 2>then no surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise and global vision became a </v>

174
00:10:09.771 --> 00:10:10.510
<v Speaker 2>centrist</v>

175
00:10:10.510 --> 00:10:11.343
<v Speaker 1>station</v>

176
00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:17.040
<v Speaker 2>making a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is merely one example.</v>

177
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:17.933
<v Speaker 2>Today there is almost no media in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Venezuela that is critical of the </v>

178
00:10:20.401 --> 00:10:21.234
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So the question I would now like to ask </v>

179
00:10:22.921 --> 00:10:23.754
<v Speaker 2>you is this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what exactly is the difference between </v>

180
00:10:26.161 --> 00:10:26.994
<v Speaker 2>Nicolas Maduro and any other dictator?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Can anybody claim Venezuela is still </v>

181
00:10:31.350 --> 00:10:32.700
<v Speaker 2>really a democracy?</v>
