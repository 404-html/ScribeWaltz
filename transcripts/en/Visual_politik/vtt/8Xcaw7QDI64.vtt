1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:02.070
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has got an image problem for years.</v>

2
00:00:02.071 --> 00:00:02.904
<v Speaker 1>This gigantic country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the second most populated in all of </v>

3
00:00:05.041 --> 00:00:05.874
<v Speaker 1>Africa with almost a hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants with a synonym for extreme </v>

4
00:00:09.181 --> 00:00:10.140
<v Speaker 1>poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hunger,</v>

5
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.060
<v Speaker 1>disease,</v>
<v Speaker 1>war in short,</v>

6
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.090
<v Speaker 1>true misery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

7
00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.400
<v Speaker 1>in the new century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>everything began to change.</v>

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.330
<v Speaker 1>Even though Ethiopia is still a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor country in the last decade,</v>

9
00:00:24.331 --> 00:00:26.640
<v Speaker 1>it has become one of the fastest growing</v>
<v Speaker 1>economies,</v>

10
00:00:26.641 --> 00:00:31.641
<v Speaker 1>not only in Africa but in the world at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the same time.</v>

11
00:00:32.341 --> 00:00:33.174
<v Speaker 1>It has grown very close to Beijing and </v>
<v Speaker 1>has also become a close ally of the </v>

12
00:00:36.121 --> 00:00:38.430
<v Speaker 1>United States in the fight against </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism.</v>

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:41.040
<v Speaker 1>Why half face single friendship if you </v>
<v Speaker 1>can have both.</v>

14
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.903
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that we're probably </v>
<v Speaker 1>witnessing nothing more or less because </v>

15
00:00:44.821 --> 00:00:45.654
<v Speaker 1>I'm the birth of a future African power </v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's more than enough reason to </v>

16
00:00:51.991 --> 00:00:55.680
<v Speaker 1>ensure that we hear on visual politic </v>
<v Speaker 1>don't want to miss what's happening in a</v>

17
00:00:55.681 --> 00:00:59.550
<v Speaker 1>country that many are already calling </v>
<v Speaker 1>the new African China.</v>

18
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.580
<v Speaker 1>So listen up after decades of tension,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hostility and confrontation before ends,</v>

19
00:01:13.051 --> 00:01:13.884
<v Speaker 1>after Eritrea gained independence from </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia in 1993 on July the ninth of </v>

20
00:01:17.731 --> 00:01:18.564
<v Speaker 1>2018 both countries signed a declaration</v>
<v Speaker 1>for peace and we should remember that </v>

21
00:01:28.671 --> 00:01:31.850
<v Speaker 1>during this long confrontation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were tragic moments.</v>

22
00:01:31.851 --> 00:01:32.684
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the military conflicts between 98 and </v>

23
00:01:34.341 --> 00:01:37.070
<v Speaker 1>2000 kills nearly a hundred thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>

24
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.450
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leaders of both countries,</v>

25
00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:40.620
<v Speaker 1>they've agreed to sign for complete </v>
<v Speaker 1>peace.</v>

26
00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.900
<v Speaker 2>We had agreed to resume the services of </v>
<v Speaker 2>our airlines to get our ports working,</v>

27
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.230
<v Speaker 2>to get our people to trade and to open </v>
<v Speaker 2>our embassies again.</v>

28
00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.123
<v Speaker 2>There is no longer a border between </v>
<v Speaker 2>Eritrea and Ethiopia because of bridge </v>

29
00:01:53.191 --> 00:01:57.360
<v Speaker 2>of love has destroyed it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I be on that Ethiopia's prime minister,</v>

30
00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.313
<v Speaker 1>but of course the question remains what </v>
<v Speaker 1>has led these two countries to suddenly </v>

31
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.570
<v Speaker 1>like each other so much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

32
00:02:03.571 --> 00:02:05.820
<v Speaker 1>my friends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even though it may seem incredible,</v>

33
00:02:05.821 --> 00:02:09.480
<v Speaker 1>one of the problems that prevented </v>
<v Speaker 1>reconciliation was this village that you</v>

34
00:02:09.481 --> 00:02:12.600
<v Speaker 1>see on the screen now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's bothering me and it's a place where</v>

35
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:13.434
<v Speaker 1>there's practically nothing at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And do you see based on the peace </v>

36
00:02:19.891 --> 00:02:24.210
<v Speaker 1>agreements that were negotiated in our g</v>
<v Speaker 1>as in the year 2000 to ends,</v>

37
00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:27.060
<v Speaker 1>the last war,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this territory belongs to Eritrea.</v>

38
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.163
<v Speaker 1>In the end,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ethiopian government realize that </v>

39
00:02:29.821 --> 00:02:30.654
<v Speaker 1>this didn't work for them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so those peace agreements didn't really </v>

40
00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>go anywhere until the now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now Ethiopia,</v>

41
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.000
<v Speaker 1>the stronger country between the two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after all,</v>

42
00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:39.834
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about a hundred million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people against just over 5 million </v>

43
00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.073
<v Speaker 1>they've decided to give up because if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you are on many occasions persisting </v>

44
00:02:48.581 --> 00:02:52.240
<v Speaker 1>just to look stronger is a mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's bad for everyone.</v>

45
00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:53.103
<v Speaker 1>There's nothing to gain and there's a </v>
<v Speaker 1>great deal to lose in any case of this </v>

46
00:02:55.931 --> 00:02:59.520
<v Speaker 1>piece is a good reflection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes that are taking place and is not</v>

47
00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.840
<v Speaker 1>because this might surprise you.</v>

48
00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.973
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

49
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Chinese model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>recent years,</v>

50
00:03:13.861 --> 00:03:17.490
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia has the calm one of the fastest</v>
<v Speaker 1>growing economies on the planet.</v>

51
00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.313
<v Speaker 1>During the last decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia has averaged a growth rate of </v>

52
00:03:24.691 --> 00:03:26.850
<v Speaker 1>around 10% per year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

53
00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.880
<v Speaker 1>check out the following graphic here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can compare Ethiopia's GDP growth per</v>

54
00:03:33.731 --> 00:03:36.820
<v Speaker 1>capita with that of another rapidly </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing country,</v>

55
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:37.683
<v Speaker 1>Vietnam and watch our,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because Ethiopia's population is huge </v>

56
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.880
<v Speaker 1>and as we're talking here about GDP per </v>
<v Speaker 1>capita,</v>

57
00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:43.743
<v Speaker 1>but the hold on a moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're not just talking about the </v>

58
00:03:45.251 --> 00:03:46.540
<v Speaker 1>economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

59
00:03:46.541 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 1>all of this growth has led to some </v>
<v Speaker 1>important social consequences,</v>

60
00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.070
<v Speaker 1>which is something that sooner or later </v>
<v Speaker 1>always happens when a country grows,</v>

61
00:03:54.071 --> 00:03:56.080
<v Speaker 1>opens up to the world and does things </v>
<v Speaker 1>right.</v>

62
00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.360
<v Speaker 1>Since the year 2000 the average life </v>
<v Speaker 1>expectancy has increased by 13 years,</v>

63
00:04:04.361 --> 00:04:05.194
<v Speaker 1>the number of workers with at least a </v>
<v Speaker 1>completed secondary education has grown </v>

64
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 1>by almost 50% it's poverty.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

65
00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.130
<v Speaker 1>look at what's happening with poverty.</v>

66
00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.250
<v Speaker 3>Yup.</v>

67
00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.120
<v Speaker 1>I know even today there is a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>poverty in Ethiopia with a simple google</v>

68
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:24.954
<v Speaker 1>search.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find terrible situations in this </v>

69
00:04:26.311 --> 00:04:27.390
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but folks,</v>

70
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:28.253
<v Speaker 1>let's be clear.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Overcoming poverty isn't something that </v>

71
00:04:30.361 --> 00:04:31.500
<v Speaker 1>happens overnight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

72
00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.250
<v Speaker 1>I wish it was that easy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

73
00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.443
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how does ABB above that country's </v>

74
00:04:37.471 --> 00:04:41.340
<v Speaker 1>capital is a good reflection of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>process that Ethiopia is experiencing?</v>

75
00:04:41.341 --> 00:04:45.510
<v Speaker 1>Cranes works and projects of all kinds </v>
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely flooding the city.</v>

76
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:46.373
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was here in this city that their </v>

77
00:04:47.701 --> 00:04:52.020
<v Speaker 1>first light subway in sub Saharan Africa</v>
<v Speaker 1>was inaugurated in 2015 yeah.</v>

78
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Having reached this point,</v>

79
00:04:56.781 --> 00:04:58.760
<v Speaker 1>the question that we must ask is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

80
00:04:58.790 --> 00:05:02.600
<v Speaker 1>how on earth has Ethiopia achieved such </v>
<v Speaker 1>an economic leap?</v>

81
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.493
<v Speaker 1>What we can say that this country has </v>
<v Speaker 1>become something like Beijing's </v>

82
00:05:05.211 --> 00:05:09.410
<v Speaker 1>outstanding.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>

83
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.273
<v Speaker 1>great.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's largely been led by essentially </v>

84
00:05:11.231 --> 00:05:13.030
<v Speaker 1>copying the Asian giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

85
00:05:13.031 --> 00:05:13.864
<v Speaker 1>on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Ethiopian government has promoted </v>

86
00:05:15.581 --> 00:05:16.414
<v Speaker 1>the construction of enormous </v>
<v Speaker 1>infrastructure projects that are </v>

87
00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.460
<v Speaker 1>essential for the country's development.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're speaking,</v>

88
00:05:23.921 --> 00:05:25.690
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of a railway line,</v>

89
00:05:25.691 --> 00:05:26.524
<v Speaker 1>the cost more than $4 billion in </v>
<v Speaker 1>connected Santa's Salbaba with the </v>

90
00:05:29.291 --> 00:05:30.124
<v Speaker 1>Djibouti port to facilitate and </v>
<v Speaker 1>merchandise exports or the greatest </v>

91
00:05:32.771 --> 00:05:36.030
<v Speaker 1>projects in all of Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Grand Ethiopian renascence.</v>

92
00:05:36.031 --> 00:05:36.864
<v Speaker 1>Damn.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a John Dam on the Nile River </v>

93
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:38.944
<v Speaker 1>that requires an investment of around $6</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion and his mission with soup </v>

94
00:05:41.521 --> 00:05:42.354
<v Speaker 1>revolutionize the country's energy </v>
<v Speaker 1>system with abundance and cheap </v>

95
00:05:44.951 --> 00:05:45.784
<v Speaker 1>electricity.</v>

96
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:50.363
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you know who gave the investment and </v>

97
00:05:51.661 --> 00:05:53.460
<v Speaker 1>the knowledge for these projects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well.</v>

98
00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:54.323
<v Speaker 1>Tony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those of you who followed this channel </v>

99
00:05:55.351 --> 00:05:57.920
<v Speaker 1>regularly won't be surprised.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To a large extent.</v>

100
00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.840
<v Speaker 1>It was China and Chinese company.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

101
00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:03.723
<v Speaker 1>China has become,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia hasn't biggest investor and </v>

102
00:06:05.751 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>trading partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

103
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.850
<v Speaker 1>a large part of the country's growth has</v>
<v Speaker 1>been due to its ties with China.</v>

104
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.470
<v Speaker 1>The second pillar of Ethiopia's growth </v>
<v Speaker 1>is that little by Netapp,</v>

105
00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.313
<v Speaker 1>large state owned companies began to </v>
<v Speaker 1>operate with more autonomy and managed </v>

106
00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:20.480
<v Speaker 1>to themselves almost as if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>private companies.</v>

107
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:32.540
<v Speaker 1>This is the case for example of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopian Airlines,</v>

108
00:06:32.541 --> 00:06:33.374
<v Speaker 1>the country's flagship carrier,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has become the largest African </v>

109
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:36.704
<v Speaker 1>airline and it's now in,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tends to compete internationally with </v>

110
00:06:38.571 --> 00:06:39.404
<v Speaker 1>the Nigga style lines in the industry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though Ethiopian Airlines is a </v>

111
00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:52.290
<v Speaker 1>hundred percent state owned,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's run like a business.</v>

112
00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:55.740
<v Speaker 1>The board runs it as if it's British </v>
<v Speaker 1>Airways or United Airlines,</v>

113
00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:56.700
<v Speaker 1>Zuma,</v>
<v Speaker 1>denon nuggets,</v>

114
00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.060
<v Speaker 1>chairman of Fairfax,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa Fund Llc,</v>

115
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.073
<v Speaker 1>and finally the third pillar thi </v>
<v Speaker 1>attraction of foreign direct investment </v>

116
00:07:04.201 --> 00:07:06.330
<v Speaker 1>through the development of economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>zones,</v>

117
00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:08.640
<v Speaker 1>fiscal incentives,</v>
<v Speaker 1>participative financing,</v>

118
00:07:08.670 --> 00:07:09.503
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at how foreign investments </v>

119
00:07:11.161 --> 00:07:11.994
<v Speaker 1>have evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is how Ethiopia has begun to </v>

120
00:07:19.571 --> 00:07:21.910
<v Speaker 1>industrialize largely because of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>policies,</v>

121
00:07:21.911 --> 00:07:22.744
<v Speaker 1>and also thanks to the cost of labor and</v>
<v Speaker 1>industry that has grown a lot in recent </v>

122
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:29.700
<v Speaker 1>years has been textiles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

123
00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:30.603
<v Speaker 1>brands such as h and m guest,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein already </v>

124
00:07:33.251 --> 00:07:35.440
<v Speaker 1>produced some of that governments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>this country,</v>

125
00:07:35.470 --> 00:07:36.303
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately that's not all that </v>
<v Speaker 1>similarities with China aren't limited </v>

126
00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.100
<v Speaker 1>to the economic part.</v>

127
00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.993
<v Speaker 3>Okay.</v>

128
00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.550
<v Speaker 1>At the same time that the country was </v>
<v Speaker 1>experiencing an economic takeoff,</v>

129
00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.510
<v Speaker 1>does that repression of civil liberties </v>
<v Speaker 1>became stronger and stronger.</v>

130
00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:50.210
<v Speaker 1>The media,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was broadly restricted.</v>

131
00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:52.680
<v Speaker 1>Political opposition was persecuted </v>
<v Speaker 1>websites,</v>

132
00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.150
<v Speaker 1>blogs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et cetera.</v>

133
00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:56.843
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this country became one of the 10 </v>

134
00:07:58.020 --> 00:07:59.700
<v Speaker 1>biggest journalist,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jailers,</v>

135
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:02.860
<v Speaker 1>and the entire wealth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopian government virtually locks up,</v>

136
00:08:02.910 --> 00:08:06.630
<v Speaker 1>forced into exile or intimidated almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>every independent journalist.</v>

137
00:08:06.690 --> 00:08:09.330
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia practically reached a situation</v>

138
00:08:09.331 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 1>in which there were no journalists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only government spokesman,</v>

139
00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:15.300
<v Speaker 1>but folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a moment because now suddenly it</v>

140
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:17.550
<v Speaker 1>looks like everything has the gun to </v>
<v Speaker 1>change.</v>

141
00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:18.443
<v Speaker 1>Listen Up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new generation beginning of 2018 </v>

142
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:35.290
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia was mired in a way of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>violence,</v>

143
00:08:35.291 --> 00:08:36.124
<v Speaker 1>racial clashes and political repression </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was threatening the country </v>

144
00:08:38.620 --> 00:08:40.540
<v Speaker 1>stability with absolute collapse.</v>

145
00:08:41.570 --> 00:08:42.020
<v Speaker 4>Okay.</v>

146
00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:46.380
<v Speaker 1>And although economically things have </v>
<v Speaker 1>worked out quite well in recent years,</v>

147
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.243
<v Speaker 1>there have been some imbalances are </v>
<v Speaker 1>rather large foreign debt and great </v>

148
00:08:50.281 --> 00:08:51.114
<v Speaker 1>shortage of foreign currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a result of large investments in </v>

149
00:08:53.191 --> 00:08:56.160
<v Speaker 1>population growth and very high,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you found employment rates.</v>

150
00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.193
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many were wondering if what if eop or </v>

151
00:08:59.671 --> 00:09:02.610
<v Speaker 1>had gone through in recent years have </v>
<v Speaker 1>been nothing but a mirage.</v>

152
00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.780
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>against all odds,</v>

153
00:09:03.781 --> 00:09:04.614
<v Speaker 1>after a high power struggle,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the ruling Party v Ethiopian People's </v>

154
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.361
<v Speaker 1>Revolutionary Democratic Front in </v>
<v Speaker 1>practice,</v>

155
00:09:09.361 --> 00:09:12.570
<v Speaker 1>the only party elected Prime Minister </v>
<v Speaker 1>Abe Akhmed,</v>

156
00:09:12.690 --> 00:09:15.840
<v Speaker 1>a 42 year old former army officer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not much was expected,</v>

157
00:09:15.841 --> 00:09:18.000
<v Speaker 1>but within just a few months,</v>
<v Speaker 1>boom.</v>

158
00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:19.890
<v Speaker 1>Things have changed.</v>

159
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:23.733
<v Speaker 1>You see you since he came to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Akhmed has released many political </v>

160
00:09:25.751 --> 00:09:26.584
<v Speaker 1>prisoners.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He has apologized for the government </v>

161
00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.673
<v Speaker 1>abuses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's announced senior officials of the </v>

162
00:09:30.341 --> 00:09:31.174
<v Speaker 1>intelligence services and the security </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces for having committed state at </v>

163
00:09:33.821 --> 00:09:34.654
<v Speaker 1>terrorism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's promoted the peace agreement with </v>

164
00:09:35.951 --> 00:09:36.784
<v Speaker 1>Eritrea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's announced her modifications to the </v>

165
00:09:38.471 --> 00:09:39.304
<v Speaker 1>constitution to establish the limitation</v>
<v Speaker 1>of mandate and he's begun to dismantle </v>

166
00:09:42.251 --> 00:09:43.084
<v Speaker 1>the political censorship and asked xcel </v>
<v Speaker 1>journalists to return to the country </v>

167
00:09:47.350 --> 00:09:51.550
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia unblocks 264 websites and TV </v>
<v Speaker 1>channels,</v>

168
00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:52.443
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he has also announced that the </v>

169
00:09:53.591 --> 00:09:56.680
<v Speaker 1>government will deepen the </v>
<v Speaker 1>liberalization of the economy to attract</v>

170
00:09:56.681 --> 00:09:57.514
<v Speaker 1>more investments to the country if </v>
<v Speaker 1>you'll be open this door to the world </v>

171
00:10:00.821 --> 00:10:03.880

<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

172
00:10:03.881 --> 00:10:04.714
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these things haven't been great </v>

173
00:10:06.521 --> 00:10:08.620
<v Speaker 1>for the country's elite since their </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer.</v>

174
00:10:08.740 --> 00:10:12.340
<v Speaker 1>It didn't take long to come.</v>
