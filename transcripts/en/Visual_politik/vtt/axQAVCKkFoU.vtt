1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:00.863
<v Speaker 1>A political threat looms over much of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world develops countries as well as </v>

2
00:00:08.531 --> 00:00:11.080
<v Speaker 1>many emerging countries such as in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China's case,</v>

3
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:11.973
<v Speaker 1>I beginning to see the effects that </v>
<v Speaker 1>demographic aging and it's can any </v>

4
00:00:14.231 --> 00:00:19.231
<v Speaker 1>public services unsustainability can </v>
<v Speaker 1>cause with increasing concern along with</v>

5
00:00:20.381 --> 00:00:21.214
<v Speaker 1>pensions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Health is another of the fields that </v>

6
00:00:22.181 --> 00:00:24.880
<v Speaker 1>generate the most uncertainties and </v>
<v Speaker 1>fears.</v>

7
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:27.813
<v Speaker 1>Increasingly aging population and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>emergence of new and expensive medical </v>

8
00:00:30.671 --> 00:00:33.520
<v Speaker 1>technologies have raised some very </v>
<v Speaker 1>important questions.</v>

9
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.593
<v Speaker 1>What would we be able to pay for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality healthcare system or when we'd </v>

10
00:00:38.581 --> 00:00:39.414
<v Speaker 1>be condemned to a precarious health </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation that affects our life </v>

11
00:00:41.981 --> 00:00:42.814
<v Speaker 1>prospects?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is there a successful model that can </v>

12
00:00:44.801 --> 00:00:46.810
<v Speaker 1>lead the way other alternatives?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

13
00:00:46.811 --> 00:00:47.644
<v Speaker 1>in this video we're going to look at a </v>
<v Speaker 1>system that we may more or less like </v>

14
00:00:50.561 --> 00:00:51.394
<v Speaker 1>that which we should definitely know </v>
<v Speaker 1>about us can take into account </v>

15
00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.170
<v Speaker 1>throughout this debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not sort of look at it,</v>

16
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.943
<v Speaker 1>check out the following graph.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shows the country leaving the third </v>

17
00:01:08.381 --> 00:01:11.920
<v Speaker 1>world's behind and becoming one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>richest areas on the planet.</v>

18
00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:22.280
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

19
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.113
<v Speaker 1>35 years ago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore in Spain at the same per </v>

20
00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:26.540
<v Speaker 1>capita income today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

21
00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:27.374
<v Speaker 1>the format more than doubles the Spanish</v>
<v Speaker 1>per capita income in 2015 in Singapore </v>

22
00:01:32.081 --> 00:01:32.914
<v Speaker 1>is per capita income was $86,100 per </v>
<v Speaker 1>year and spends was just $34,750 but </v>

23
00:01:41.211 --> 00:01:44.060
<v Speaker 1>even if we look at countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Finland,</v>

24
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.140
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>

25
00:01:45.141 --> 00:01:47.330
<v Speaker 1>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or the United States as examples,</v>

26
00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.290
<v Speaker 1>we'd be able to see that Singapore is </v>
<v Speaker 1>much richer than any of them.</v>

27
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:54.710
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's often said that Singapore's example</v>

28
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:55.544
<v Speaker 1>isn't good enough because their wealth </v>
<v Speaker 1>essentially comes from a financial </v>

29
00:01:58.041 --> 00:02:01.370
<v Speaker 1>sector that is much larger than any of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the aforementioned mentions countries,</v>

30
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.293
<v Speaker 1>and that's true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not the only key to this small </v>

31
00:02:05.271 --> 00:02:06.104
<v Speaker 1>states success.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The weight of Singapore's financial </v>

32
00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:12.230
<v Speaker 1>sector isn't big enough to explain these</v>
<v Speaker 1>differences in par capita income.</v>

33
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.153
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we were to eliminate the effects of </v>

34
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.330
<v Speaker 1>these countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>different financial sector sizes,</v>

35
00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.193
<v Speaker 1>Singapore would still be much richer </v>
<v Speaker 1>than the others because it's actually </v>

36
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.193
<v Speaker 1>both trade and manufacturing are more </v>
<v Speaker 1>important in Singapore than the </v>

37
00:02:27.651 --> 00:02:28.484
<v Speaker 1>financial sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about one of the largest </v>

38
00:02:30.441 --> 00:02:33.410
<v Speaker 1>merchandise exporting countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire world.</v>

39
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.273
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the proportion of electronic material </v>

40
00:02:36.121 --> 00:02:40.520
<v Speaker 1>that this country exports in relation to</v>
<v Speaker 1>its GDP is larger than the proportion of</v>

41
00:02:40.521 --> 00:02:42.770
<v Speaker 1>anything exported by countries like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>

42
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.880
<v Speaker 1>Sweden,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Denmark,</v>

43
00:02:43.881 --> 00:02:48.440
<v Speaker 1>or even Germany.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question now becomes,</v>

44
00:02:48.441 --> 00:02:51.830
<v Speaker 1>how did Singapore achieved such a high </v>
<v Speaker 1>level of prosperity?</v>

45
00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.260
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if we wanted to simplify it,</v>

46
00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:01.780
<v Speaker 1>we could say that Singapore is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>freest economy in the wells according to</v>

47
00:03:01.781 --> 00:03:02.614
<v Speaker 1>the index of economic freedom published </v>
<v Speaker 1>annually by the Heritage Foundation and </v>

48
00:03:05.671 --> 00:03:07.450
<v Speaker 1>the Wall Street Journal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's public spending,</v>

49
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is half of the u acids and a third of </v>

50
00:03:10.781 --> 00:03:11.614
<v Speaker 1>Sweden's listen to the words of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>historic president's of Singapore Lee </v>

51
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:16.293
<v Speaker 1>Kuan Yew,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which successfully reflect to the real </v>

52
00:03:17.621 --> 00:03:20.380
<v Speaker 1>foundations of this country's economic </v>
<v Speaker 1>success.</v>

53
00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:23.483
<v Speaker 1>When most of the third world was deeply </v>
<v Speaker 1>suspicious of exploitation by Western </v>

54
00:03:26.581 --> 00:03:29.430
<v Speaker 1>multinational corporations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore invited them in,</v>

55
00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:30.413
<v Speaker 1>they helped us grow,</v>
<v Speaker 1>brought in technology and knowhow and </v>

56
00:03:32.641 --> 00:03:33.474
<v Speaker 1>raised productivity levels faster than </v>
<v Speaker 1>any alternative strategy could of Lee </v>

57
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.210
<v Speaker 1>Kuan Yew.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about what success is,</v>

58
00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.310
<v Speaker 1>therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not due to the financial industry,</v>

59
00:03:41.311 --> 00:03:45.780
<v Speaker 1>but due to the same reasons that have </v>
<v Speaker 1>led to the growth of other economies.</v>

60
00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.760
<v Speaker 1>Legal security,</v>
<v Speaker 1>low taxes,</v>

61
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.270
<v Speaker 1>monetary stability and moderate </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulations.</v>

62
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:52.063
<v Speaker 2>Yes</v>

63
00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.580
<v Speaker 1>to the free market has made this country</v>
<v Speaker 1>become in many areas.</v>

64
00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:58.443
<v Speaker 1>An example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and we're not only talking strictly </v>

65
00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:06.464
<v Speaker 1>about economics here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also certain social issues such as </v>

66
00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.370
<v Speaker 1>health.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you have that ride,</v>

67
00:04:10.371 --> 00:04:13.340
<v Speaker 1>Singapore is also a role model in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of health policy.</v>

68
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.963
<v Speaker 3>Okay,</v>

69
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.080
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will Challenge.</v>

70
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.033
<v Speaker 3>Sure.</v>

71
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.110
<v Speaker 1>Let's take a look for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at Spain's case,</v>

72
00:04:25.111 --> 00:04:25.944
<v Speaker 1>a country whose health system is </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered one of the most efficient on </v>

73
00:04:28.081 --> 00:04:28.741
<v Speaker 1>the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

74
00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:32.010
<v Speaker 1>the problem is that beyond is me </v>
<v Speaker 1>incorrigible that isn't sustainable.</v>

75
00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.570
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in just a decade,</v>

76
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:37.140
<v Speaker 1>the total cost of the Spanish health </v>
<v Speaker 1>system has almost doubles and everything</v>

77
00:04:37.141 --> 00:04:37.974
<v Speaker 1>indicates that as a result of the aging </v>
<v Speaker 1>population and the demand for new and </v>

78
00:04:40.981 --> 00:04:44.970
<v Speaker 1>expensive health technologies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this trends will be unstoppable and will</v>

79
00:04:44.971 --> 00:04:45.804
<v Speaker 1>continue to worsen year after year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And don't think that this only happens </v>

80
00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.200
<v Speaker 1>in Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

81
00:04:53.201 --> 00:04:54.340
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>medical bills,</v>

82
00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.240
<v Speaker 1>that is the sustainability of health </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems is a widespread problem in other</v>

83
00:04:58.241 --> 00:04:59.074
<v Speaker 1>developed countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question that arises is how can </v>

84
00:05:01.061 --> 00:05:05.840
<v Speaker 1>we overcome these challenges and ensure </v>
<v Speaker 1>the sustainability of healthcare system</v>

85
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.820
<v Speaker 3>good</v>

86
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:09.653
<v Speaker 1>model,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which has never taken into account </v>

87
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.800
<v Speaker 1>because perhaps speed that have a </v>
<v Speaker 1>complete the free health system,</v>

88
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:14.693
<v Speaker 1>a system in which demand and supply on </v>
<v Speaker 1>determines by the market and not in </v>

89
00:05:17.941 --> 00:05:20.910
<v Speaker 1>political offices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This could lead to some benefits for one</v>

90
00:05:20.911 --> 00:05:22.560
<v Speaker 1>more money for families.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thanks Steph.</v>

91
00:05:22.561 --> 00:05:23.394
<v Speaker 1>And lower taxes and a precaution re </v>
<v Speaker 1>saving level against any ailments that </v>

92
00:05:26.491 --> 00:05:28.740
<v Speaker 1>may arise that's higher than the present</v>
<v Speaker 1>one.</v>

93
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:29.603
<v Speaker 1>This would allow for direct primary care</v>
<v Speaker 1>payments and insurance against minor </v>

94
00:05:32.461 --> 00:05:33.510
<v Speaker 1>ailments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>common issues,</v>

95
00:05:33.511 --> 00:05:34.830
<v Speaker 1>and more expensive treatment.</v>

96
00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:41.630
<v Speaker 3>Another</v>

97
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:42.463
<v Speaker 1>benefit would be a greater diversity of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its competition among different health </v>

98
00:05:44.781 --> 00:05:45.614
<v Speaker 1>centers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would mean they'd given the threat </v>

99
00:05:46.731 --> 00:05:48.920
<v Speaker 1>of being displaced in the market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's productivity,</v>

100
00:05:48.921 --> 00:05:51.770
<v Speaker 1>differentiation and innovation would be </v>
<v Speaker 1>promoted,</v>

101
00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:52.663
<v Speaker 1>and other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd achieved a wide range of services </v>

102
00:05:54.321 --> 00:05:58.340
<v Speaker 1>that would positively impact both for </v>
<v Speaker 1>quality of the service and lead to lower</v>

103
00:05:58.341 --> 00:05:59.174
<v Speaker 1>prices.</v>

104
00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:05.400
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

105
00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:06.233
<v Speaker 1>Susan is usually the best formula is in </v>
<v Speaker 1>guarantee better goods and services for </v>

106
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:10.620
<v Speaker 1>consumers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since health gap,</v>

107
00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.513
<v Speaker 1>it's not any different.</v>

108
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.830
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

109
00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:15.910
<v Speaker 1>How is it nowadays?</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Country Muses.</v>

110
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.690
<v Speaker 1>All of these principles and to know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>US health care system,</v>

111
00:06:18.691 --> 00:06:21.780
<v Speaker 1>as we'll see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't precisely a free market model.</v>

112
00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:23.550
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a country that has used some of</v>

113
00:06:23.551 --> 00:06:27.630
<v Speaker 1>these characteristics since it has done </v>
<v Speaker 1>so with extraordinary results.</v>

114
00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 1>So let's consider Singapore's case model</v>
<v Speaker 1>for health reform.</v>

115
00:06:41.390 --> 00:06:44.110
<v Speaker 1>Why now?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore has the best healthcare system</v>

116
00:06:44.111 --> 00:06:47.670
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's top quality and costs.</v>

117
00:06:47.671 --> 00:06:48.504
<v Speaker 1>Practically half of that of Spain's </v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare system and less than a third </v>

118
00:06:52.111 --> 00:06:57.111
<v Speaker 1>of that of the United States isn't just </v>
<v Speaker 1>a matter of lower cost is also above all</v>

119
00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:02.010
<v Speaker 1>about quality and results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

120
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:02.883
<v Speaker 1>life expectancy at birth in Singapore is</v>
<v Speaker 1>two to three years longer than in </v>

121
00:07:05.741 --> 00:07:06.574
<v Speaker 1>Britain or the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's infant mortality rate is among the </v>

122
00:07:08.921 --> 00:07:11.980
<v Speaker 1>lowest in the world and just almost half</v>
<v Speaker 1>that of the United States,</v>

123
00:07:11.981 --> 00:07:13.180
<v Speaker 1>Great Britain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia,</v>

124
00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:14.640
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or France.</v>

125
00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:18.403
<v Speaker 1>Generally it's mortality rates are </v>
<v Speaker 1>impressive compared to most western </v>

126
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

127
00:07:21.740 --> 00:07:25.940
<v Speaker 1>the question we can ask ourselves here </v>
<v Speaker 1>is how did they achieve such success?</v>

128
00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:26.691
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in this case,</v>

129
00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:29.810
<v Speaker 1>they have achieved at fundamentally by </v>
<v Speaker 1>using market criteria.</v>

130
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:30.733
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the main feature of the Singapore model </v>

131
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:33.083
<v Speaker 1>doesn't just lie in the fact that more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than 60% of all health spending is </v>

132
00:07:35.931 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 1>private space.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To a large extent,</v>

133
00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.970
<v Speaker 1>it is paid directly by users.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is,</v>

134
00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:42.960
<v Speaker 1>copayments is the norm.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.500
<v Speaker 1>Everyone pays the same.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When they go to a hospital,</v>

136
00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:53.140
<v Speaker 1>there are public and private centers as </v>
<v Speaker 1>well as five levels,</v>

137
00:07:53.141 --> 00:07:54.520
<v Speaker 1>five classes a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>b,</v>

138
00:07:54.521 --> 00:07:56.560
<v Speaker 1>one b two Plus B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two and c.</v>

139
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:59.200
<v Speaker 1>Each of these letters gives users a </v>
<v Speaker 1>different service.</v>

140
00:07:59.201 --> 00:08:01.540
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>class a gets you a private room and it's</v>

141
00:08:01.541 --> 00:08:02.374
<v Speaker 1>my choice of doctor while in class.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See the dream is shattered and the </v>

142
00:08:04.511 --> 00:08:06.430
<v Speaker 1>doctor is assigned by the hospital.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

143
00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:09.880
<v Speaker 1>each class has a different cost.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the user chooses Class A,</v>

144
00:08:09.881 --> 00:08:11.950
<v Speaker 1>they pay for everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead,</v>

145
00:08:11.951 --> 00:08:15.190
<v Speaker 1>if they choose class,</v>
<v Speaker 1>see the government subsidizes 80% of the</v>

146
00:08:15.191 --> 00:08:16.024
<v Speaker 1>cost,</v>

147
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:21.720
<v Speaker 1>but where do people get the money to pay</v>
<v Speaker 1>for health care?</v>

148
00:08:21.810 --> 00:08:22.643
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from the same place as in other </v>

149
00:08:23.731 --> 00:08:26.700
<v Speaker 1>countries from the wealth that they </v>
<v Speaker 1>generate from their work.</v>

150
00:08:26.730 --> 00:08:29.610
<v Speaker 1>The difference is that the huge </v>
<v Speaker 1>contributions that government is usually</v>

151
00:08:29.611 --> 00:08:32.730
<v Speaker 1>collect that saved in Singapore in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>mandatory way.</v>

152
00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:33.593
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>citizens have a special accounts where </v>

153
00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:35.664
<v Speaker 1>they keep this money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can only use these accounts for </v>

154
00:08:37.231 --> 00:08:39.480
<v Speaker 1>certain purposes such as paying that </v>
<v Speaker 1>pensions,</v>

155
00:08:39.481 --> 00:08:42.210
<v Speaker 1>their children's education for their </v>
<v Speaker 1>home or their health.</v>

156
00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.073
<v Speaker 1>In the case of healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the account is known as medisafe and </v>

157
00:08:45.181 --> 00:08:47.790
<v Speaker 1>does he use to pay for doctors visits,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitalizations,</v>

158
00:08:47.791 --> 00:08:48.870
<v Speaker 1>medications,</v>
<v Speaker 1>et Cetera.</v>

159
00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:52.273
<v Speaker 1>This is the second key points of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore's medical system thanks to </v>

160
00:08:54.741 --> 00:08:55.574
<v Speaker 1>this formula of demand is self </v>
<v Speaker 1>regulating and people can manage how to </v>

161
00:08:57.961 --> 00:09:00.300
<v Speaker 1>spend the money they accumulate in these</v>
<v Speaker 1>accounts.</v>

162
00:09:00.301 --> 00:09:01.134
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by accessing different kinds of cow </v>

163
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:03.743
<v Speaker 1>whether they want to receive or be </v>
<v Speaker 1>hospitalized in hospitals with fewer </v>

164
00:09:06.061 --> 00:09:06.894
<v Speaker 1>comforts but which are cheaper or with </v>
<v Speaker 1>more services and higher costs </v>

165
00:09:09.811 --> 00:09:12.180
<v Speaker 1>decreasing redundant and sip after was </v>
<v Speaker 1>concerned.</v>

166
00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.093
<v Speaker 2>Hello?</v>

167
00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:15.583
<v Speaker 1>Very important point is that for most </v>
<v Speaker 1>serious cases there's universal public </v>

168
00:09:19.341 --> 00:09:20.174
<v Speaker 1>insurance which is known as a shield </v>
<v Speaker 1>that it costs only $16 a month for a 30 </v>

169
00:09:24.051 --> 00:09:24.884
<v Speaker 1>year old person and with its of course </v>
<v Speaker 1>comes the possibility of hiring other </v>

170
00:09:27.861 --> 00:09:30.050
<v Speaker 1>private insurer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that improve the services?</v>

171
00:09:33.090 --> 00:09:33.923
<v Speaker 1>Only.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The third leg of Singapore's health </v>

172
00:09:34.741 --> 00:09:35.574
<v Speaker 1>system is public expenditure itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What happens if someone cannot cover </v>

173
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.170
<v Speaker 1>their medical bills?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

174
00:09:40.171 --> 00:09:43.600
<v Speaker 1>to guarantee access to healthcare,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the government subsidizes hospitals.</v>

175
00:09:43.601 --> 00:09:46.200
<v Speaker 1>Sound has a public funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Metro funds,</v>

176
00:09:46.201 --> 00:09:49.410
<v Speaker 1>which is designed to pay health bills </v>
<v Speaker 1>for lower income family.</v>

177
00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:53.370
<v Speaker 2>Sorry</v>

178
00:09:53.370 --> 00:09:54.360
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is how it,</v>

179
00:09:54.361 --> 00:09:55.194
<v Speaker 1>Singapore has managed to create a </v>
<v Speaker 1>relatively economical medical system </v>

180
00:09:58.641 --> 00:09:59.474
<v Speaker 1>while achieving results and quality </v>
<v Speaker 1>levels that placed it among the best </v>

181
00:10:01.961 --> 00:10:02.794
<v Speaker 1>health systems in the world according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>the World Health Organization and </v>

182
00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:09.010
<v Speaker 1>different rankings such as Bloomberg's </v>
<v Speaker 1>most efficient healthcare systems.</v>

183
00:10:12.190 --> 00:10:13.570
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite all of this,</v>

184
00:10:13.571 --> 00:10:16.330
<v Speaker 1>when we usually talk about healthcare in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the free market,</v>

185
00:10:16.331 --> 00:10:19.360
<v Speaker 1>we automatically think of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States since not Singapore,</v>

186
00:10:19.390 --> 00:10:21.100
<v Speaker 1>which is a serious mistake.</v>

187
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.100
<v Speaker 4>Are you listening?</v>

188
00:10:27.820 --> 00:10:28.653
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

189
00:10:30.770 --> 00:10:32.480
<v Speaker 1>USA versus Singapore?</v>

190
00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:33.703
<v Speaker 2>Oh</v>

191
00:10:34.730 --> 00:10:35.330
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>indeed.</v>

192
00:10:35.330 --> 00:10:36.163
<v Speaker 1>The U s does not have a European style </v>
<v Speaker 1>public health system and since the </v>

193
00:10:39.531 --> 00:10:43.790
<v Speaker 1>country results are quite deplorable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>considering that it spends more than 17%</v>

194
00:10:43.791 --> 00:10:44.624
<v Speaker 1>of its GDP on its healthcare system,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is quite that of most European </v>

195
00:10:47.421 --> 00:10:49.190
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the debate on health,</v>

196
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:52.640
<v Speaker 1>it seems settled to private health care </v>
<v Speaker 1>is worse than public health care because</v>

197
00:10:52.641 --> 00:10:57.200
<v Speaker 1>it costs twice as much and has similar </v>
<v Speaker 1>or even lower service levels.</v>

198
00:10:57.230 --> 00:10:58.063
<v Speaker 1>But this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as we saw with Singapore where 60% of </v>

199
00:10:59.901 --> 00:11:02.840
<v Speaker 1>health spending is private simply isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>true in Singapore.</v>

200
00:11:02.841 --> 00:11:06.290
<v Speaker 1>The health care system isn't any better.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's one of the best in the world and it</v>

201
00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:09.800
<v Speaker 1>involves much lower costs than in other </v>
<v Speaker 1>developed countries.</v>

202
00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:11.513
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

203
00:11:11.810 --> 00:11:12.643
<v Speaker 1>The issue is that the US healthcare </v>
<v Speaker 1>system isn't only heavily intervenes </v>

204
00:11:15.261 --> 00:11:17.120
<v Speaker 1>upon it and is regulated by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government.</v>

205
00:11:17.150 --> 00:11:22.150
<v Speaker 1>It's cost is tremendously socialized.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

206
00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:23.713
<v Speaker 1>90% of all health spending is channeled </v>
<v Speaker 1>through two different agents other than </v>

207
00:11:27.021 --> 00:11:30.110
<v Speaker 1>the patients how's of every hundred </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars spent in the US health system?</v>

208
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:30.973
<v Speaker 1>45 comes from insurance companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>45 from state programs such as Medicaid </v>

209
00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:37.970
<v Speaker 1>and only 10% from patients' pockets.</v>

210
00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:44.843
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public health spending in the United </v>

211
00:11:46.770 --> 00:11:49.170
<v Speaker 1>States is in relative terms higher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

212
00:11:49.230 --> 00:11:50.063
<v Speaker 1>than in Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we're going to talk about that in </v>

213
00:11:51.631 --> 00:11:52.980
<v Speaker 1>another video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is,</v>

214
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.080
<v Speaker 1>as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Singapore sets a healthcare system model</v>

215
00:11:56.081 --> 00:11:59.020
<v Speaker 1>on the table that has a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>combination of cost,</v>

216
00:11:59.021 --> 00:12:00.790
<v Speaker 1>innovation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and medical results.</v>

217
00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:03.670
<v Speaker 1>We may like some aspects of the system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and not others,</v>

218
00:12:03.671 --> 00:12:04.504
<v Speaker 1>but I think it wouldn't be unreasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>to take it into accounts when talking </v>

219
00:12:07.360 --> 00:12:10.510
<v Speaker 1>about health for future and </v>
<v Speaker 1>sustainability.</v>

220
