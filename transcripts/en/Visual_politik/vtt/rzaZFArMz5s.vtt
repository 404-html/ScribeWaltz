00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:09.093
<v Speaker 1>In September of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico suffered it's most </v>

2
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.920
<v Speaker 1>significant natural disaster in the last</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years.</v>

3
00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.443
<v Speaker 1>The impacts of Hurricane Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a huge category for cycling a category </v>

4
00:00:22.301 --> 00:00:23.134
<v Speaker 1>five at its strongest with wind gusts of</v>
<v Speaker 1>over 155 miles per hour and torrential </v>

5
00:00:26.711 --> 00:00:29.710
<v Speaker 1>rain wreaks havoc on this islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The destruction,</v>

6
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:30.783
<v Speaker 1>it was enormous.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands of houses were destroyed in </v>

7
00:00:32.921 --> 00:00:35.550
<v Speaker 1>the entire Puerto Rican electricity </v>
<v Speaker 1>network collapsed.</v>

8
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 1>The islands was quite literally engulfed</v>
<v Speaker 1>in darkness.</v>

9
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.380
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the economic damage was enormous.</v>

10
00:00:41.381 --> 00:00:42.214
<v Speaker 1>To give you an idea today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reconstruction costs have risen to </v>

11
00:00:44.501 --> 00:00:49.501
<v Speaker 1>around $100,000,000,000 and that's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>at all.</v>

12
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.293
<v Speaker 1>Seven months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thousands of businesses remain closed </v>

13
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.440
<v Speaker 1>and blackouts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll still quite frequent.</v>

14
00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.303
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you are just wasting because </v>

15
00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:00.500
<v Speaker 1>Hurricane Maria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>myself,</v>

16
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:01.393
<v Speaker 1>the whole story,</v>

17
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.860
<v Speaker 1>he says that the island's problems began</v>
<v Speaker 1>a really long time ago.</v>

18
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.200
<v Speaker 1>Pressing Rico,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've been suffering a severe economic</v>

19
00:01:15.201 --> 00:01:16.034
<v Speaker 1>crisis and the population exodus for </v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 10 years and exit is so great </v>

20
00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:22.010
<v Speaker 1>that it threatens the island's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>survival.</v>

21
00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.390
<v Speaker 1>See officer declaring bankruptcy in May </v>
<v Speaker 1>of 2017.</v>

22
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.253
<v Speaker 1>The situation has become so critical </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the islands government is </v>

23
00:01:29.811 --> 00:01:30.644
<v Speaker 1>considering moving thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners do private prisons in the </v>

24
00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.270
<v Speaker 1>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so why is this?</v>

25
00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.133
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the islands government is even having </v>

26
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.570
<v Speaker 1>problems with financing it's own </v>
<v Speaker 1>penitentiary system and renting spots in</v>

27
00:01:41.571 --> 00:01:44.810
<v Speaker 1>places like Texas or Florida is actually</v>
<v Speaker 1>proving to be.</v>

28
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.923
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

29
00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.680
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a moment here.</v>

30
00:01:49.681 --> 00:01:52.410
<v Speaker 1>I mean prisoners to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It sounds kind of weird,</v>

31
00:01:52.411 --> 00:01:53.244
<v Speaker 1>but you absolutely heard it right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do not forget the Puerto Rico is a part </v>

32
00:01:56.371 --> 00:01:58.320
<v Speaker 1>of the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's not a state,</v>

33
00:01:58.321 --> 00:02:00.720
<v Speaker 1>but it's kind of a free associated </v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

34
00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.330
<v Speaker 2>When we left,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when we also love Puerto Rico,</v>

35
00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.780
<v Speaker 2>it has to back and</v>

36
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.210
<v Speaker 1>of course by being a part of the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>

37
00:02:22.211 --> 00:02:24.190
<v Speaker 1>having a tropical climate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a rich history,</v>

38
00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:26.800
<v Speaker 1>and it's beautiful white sand beaches on</v>
<v Speaker 1>which by the way,</v>

39
00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:29.620
<v Speaker 1>Captain Jack Sparrow had some of his </v>
<v Speaker 1>most famous exploits.</v>

40
00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.483
<v Speaker 1>We might think that Puerto Rico has </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything required to be one of the </v>

41
00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:35.230
<v Speaker 1>most prosperous places in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

42
00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.670
<v Speaker 1>the reality is not so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is rarely rather difference.</v>

43
00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.973
<v Speaker 1>Here's a question for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Where do you think most Puerto Rican </v>

44
00:02:50.351 --> 00:02:51.184
<v Speaker 1>slip?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it sounds like a bit of a silly </v>

45
00:02:52.751 --> 00:02:55.300
<v Speaker 1>question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't because the answer,</v>

46
00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.360
<v Speaker 1>it's not Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The escape.</v>

47
00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.913
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first Puerto Rico may look like a </v>

48
00:03:09.101 --> 00:03:10.210
<v Speaker 1>paradise.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Good weather,</v>

49
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.250
<v Speaker 1>beautiful beaches,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wonderful music.</v>

50
00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island has a huge problem.</v>

51
00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.963
<v Speaker 1>Every year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thousands and thousands of Puerto Rican </v>

52
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.933
<v Speaker 1>leave the islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See Puerto Rican been US citizens since </v>

53
00:03:21.431 --> 00:03:22.264
<v Speaker 1>1917.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They are Americans and they can move </v>

54
00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.100
<v Speaker 1>freely around that country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

55
00:03:27.101 --> 00:03:29.140
<v Speaker 1>according to data from the Pew Research </v>
<v Speaker 1>Center,</v>

56
00:03:29.141 --> 00:03:29.974
<v Speaker 1>during the last decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 500,000 Puerto Ricans have </v>

57
00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>left Puerto Rico to move to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consonants,</v>

58
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:37.540
<v Speaker 1>to places like Texas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Florida and New York and Pennsylvania.</v>

59
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:40.513
<v Speaker 1>Half a million people isn't absolutely </v>
<v Speaker 1>huge number for an island that has just </v>

60
00:03:44.031 --> 00:03:46.640
<v Speaker 1>over 3 million inhabitants seen in </v>
<v Speaker 1>another way.</v>

61
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.503
<v Speaker 1>Not only in the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of every seven inhabitants has left </v>

62
00:03:51.261 --> 00:03:54.290
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rather.</v>

63
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:55.303
<v Speaker 1>The question I just asked,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why do you think most pressure eakins </v>

64
00:03:56.781 --> 00:03:59.360
<v Speaker 1>lived?</v>
<v Speaker 1>While the answer is that since 2006,</v>

65
00:03:59.361 --> 00:04:02.900
<v Speaker 1>there are more Puerto Ricans living in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the continental United States than there</v>

66
00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:07.670
<v Speaker 1>are on the island specifically more than</v>
<v Speaker 1>5 million compared to just over three.</v>

67
00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.983
<v Speaker 1>We were watching a real live demographic</v>
<v Speaker 1>and population collapse on a monumental </v>

68
00:04:12.981 --> 00:04:13.814
<v Speaker 1>scale.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Limestone and independent migration </v>

69
00:04:15.921 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 1>researcher and economist at the US </v>
<v Speaker 1>Agriculture Department and things,</v>

70
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.260
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they could get much,</v>

71
00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 1>much worse,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the islands are in government expect</v>

72
00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:28.430
<v Speaker 1>just in 2018 for another 200,000 people </v>
<v Speaker 1>to leave the islands.</v>

73
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:33.500
<v Speaker 1>This means that Puerto Rico will lose </v>
<v Speaker 1>about six percent of its population in a</v>

74
00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:34.333
<v Speaker 1>single year.</v>

75
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:39.333
<v Speaker 2>Sorry</v>

76
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.580
<v Speaker 1>if you thought this process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this accident was already severe.</v>

77
00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the consequences of Hurricane Maria,</v>

78
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.360
<v Speaker 1>they found the accelerated as different </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimates,</v>

79
00:04:47.361 --> 00:04:48.194
<v Speaker 1>both from the governments and from </v>
<v Speaker 1>private consultants expect another half </v>

80
00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:51.853
<v Speaker 1>million Puerto Rican to pack their bags </v>
<v Speaker 1>and move to the consonants in the next </v>

81
00:04:54.171 --> 00:04:55.004
<v Speaker 1>five years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm very attached to my island and my </v>

82
00:04:57.891 --> 00:04:58.724
<v Speaker 1>preference is to stay here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I have to think about what's best </v>

83
00:05:01.221 --> 00:05:03.200
<v Speaker 1>for my son,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Victor Domingo's,</v>

84
00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.380
<v Speaker 1>a 39 year old mortgage banker to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Washington Post.</v>

85
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.000
<v Speaker 1>As you may imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Centra flights.</v>

86
00:05:08.001 --> 00:05:10.610
<v Speaker 1>We'll have very serious consequences for</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island,</v>

87
00:05:10.611 --> 00:05:13.500
<v Speaker 1>especially because most of those who are</v>
<v Speaker 1>leaving a young infants,</v>

88
00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.290
<v Speaker 1>it is estimated that half of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>

89
00:05:15.291 --> 00:05:18.620
<v Speaker 1>of all people who leave the islands are </v>
<v Speaker 1>under 24 years of age,</v>

90
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:21.720
<v Speaker 1>so what's the result of all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

91
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.573
<v Speaker 1>in the next decade,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico is population will decrease </v>

92
00:05:24.381 --> 00:05:27.290
<v Speaker 1>to two point 5 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to say in the next decade,</v>

93
00:05:27.291 --> 00:05:30.530
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico will lose 800,000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants,</v>

94
00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.590
<v Speaker 1>25 percent of its population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if another natural disaster,</v>

95
00:05:39.711 --> 00:05:40.970
<v Speaker 1>another hurricane,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

96
00:05:40.971 --> 00:05:41.804
<v Speaker 1>the cars or if the island fails to </v>
<v Speaker 1>recover from the severe crisis that's </v>

97
00:05:44.241 --> 00:05:46.520
<v Speaker 1>going through the reality,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be even worse.</v>

98
00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:47.413
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>can you imagine what this will mean for </v>

99
00:05:48.471 --> 00:05:50.360
<v Speaker 1>the island's economy?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to pay?</v>

100
00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.300
<v Speaker 1>It's huge debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who's going to pay for its pension?</v>

101
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.013
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I think at this point in the video we </v>

102
00:06:02.801 --> 00:06:06.340
<v Speaker 1>need to ask a question,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why does so many Puerto Ricans leave the</v>

103
00:06:06.341 --> 00:06:07.174
<v Speaker 1>islands?</v>
<v Speaker 1>These statistics seem to be similar to </v>

104
00:06:08.321 --> 00:06:10.720
<v Speaker 1>that of a country going through a war.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what's going on?</v>

105
00:06:10.780 --> 00:06:15.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen to this very long crisis.</v>

106
00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.420
<v Speaker 1>If we take a look at the data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the explanation seems very clear.</v>

107
00:06:27.480 --> 00:06:28.313
<v Speaker 1>Almost half of Puerto Rican is living on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the islands are considered poor by US </v>

108
00:06:31.681 --> 00:06:34.830
<v Speaker 1>standards.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average family income is $20,000,</v>

109
00:06:34.831 --> 00:06:37.740
<v Speaker 1>which is slightly less than half of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>average income of Mississippi.</v>

110
00:06:37.741 --> 00:06:40.470
<v Speaker 1>The poorest state in the continental </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States.</v>

111
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:42.120
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

112
00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:49.143
<v Speaker 1>Well that's not all the islands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government is bankrupt and it is a huge </v>

113
00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.160
<v Speaker 1>public desk.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seventy dollars,</v>

114
00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:56.500
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars and another </v>
<v Speaker 1>$50,000,000,000 in payment commitments.</v>

115
00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:57.353
<v Speaker 1>Like for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's pensions or we're talking about an </v>

116
00:06:59.771 --> 00:07:02.650
<v Speaker 1>islands of just over 3 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

117
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:04.960
<v Speaker 1>So that's really an insane amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

118
00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:13.620
<v Speaker 1>It means that an average family would </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to devote six years of their salary</v>

119
00:07:13.710 --> 00:07:14.543
<v Speaker 1>to pay off the public debt.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be able to understand </v>

120
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:19.860
<v Speaker 1>why Puerto Rico is known as the grease </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the Caribbean,</v>

121
00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.720
<v Speaker 1>and if you think this is the worst of </v>
<v Speaker 1>it,</v>

122
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.613
<v Speaker 1>when you're absolutely right,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is that there's hardly any work in </v>

123
00:07:26.591 --> 00:07:27.670
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

124
00:07:27.671 --> 00:07:30.670
<v Speaker 1>the island has the lowest activity rates</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the United States.</v>

125
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.940
<v Speaker 1>Only four out of every 10 adults </v>
<v Speaker 1>actively looking for work.</v>

126
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:36.700
<v Speaker 1>And if we don't come with the people who</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't have a job in the public sector,</v>

127
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.340
<v Speaker 1>who salaries come out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if the taxes,</v>

128
00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:40.780
<v Speaker 1>the people who work in the private </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector provide the results,</v>

129
00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.673
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty alarming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less than a quarter of the island's </v>

130
00:07:43.331 --> 00:07:45.400
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants work in the private sector.</v>

131
00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:48.173
<v Speaker 2>Bye.</v>

132
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:49.053
<v Speaker 1>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of Puerto Rico's great problems is </v>

133
00:07:50.491 --> 00:07:51.324
<v Speaker 1>precisely this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Public employees and officials see </v>

134
00:07:53.911 --> 00:07:57.630
<v Speaker 1>almost one out of every four jobs on the</v>
<v Speaker 1>island corresponds to the governments.</v>

135
00:07:57.631 --> 00:07:58.464
<v Speaker 1>And that's not the worst part.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did you know that many of these public </v>

136
00:08:01.171 --> 00:08:03.990
<v Speaker 1>employees have the right to retire at </v>
<v Speaker 1>the age of 50,</v>

137
00:08:03.991 --> 00:08:07.260
<v Speaker 1>which is 15 years earlier than in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the United States.</v>

138
00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.690
<v Speaker 1>And if you want things to get even more </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrifying,</v>

139
00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:16.553
<v Speaker 1>you can also keep in mind is that given </v>
<v Speaker 1>the high percentage of young people </v>

140
00:08:18.931 --> 00:08:21.630
<v Speaker 1>leaving,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the island's population is aging very,</v>

141
00:08:21.690 --> 00:08:22.980
<v Speaker 1>very quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

142
00:08:22.981 --> 00:08:25.830
<v Speaker 1>if things don't change,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico will enter a very,</v>

143
00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 1>very difficult situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But okay.</v>

144
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.580
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure at this point in the video </v>
<v Speaker 1>you're wondering,</v>

145
00:08:29.581 --> 00:08:30.414
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how on earth can the island get out of </v>

146
00:08:31.561 --> 00:08:32.394
<v Speaker 1>this mess?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Is that really a way out for Puerto </v>

147
00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:35.250
<v Speaker 1>Rico?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

148
00:08:35.250 --> 00:08:36.083
<v Speaker 1>that's how it look</v>

149
00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:45.460
<v Speaker 3>how to get out of this.</v>
<v Speaker 3>It's often</v>

150
00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:48.820
<v Speaker 1>said that those who don't learn from </v>
<v Speaker 1>history are condemned to repeat it,</v>

151
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:49.713
<v Speaker 1>and indeed this might happen in Puerto </v>
<v Speaker 1>Rico when we talk about how local </v>

152
00:08:52.181 --> 00:08:54.910
<v Speaker 1>politicians see the future,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we find some good things,</v>

153
00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:58.530
<v Speaker 1>but also some not so good things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Puerto Rico has gone bankrupt.</v>

154
00:08:58.531 --> 00:09:00.570
<v Speaker 1>That's the facts.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if they continue like this,</v>

155
00:09:00.571 --> 00:09:03.000
<v Speaker 1>the government could push the islands </v>
<v Speaker 1>into the abyss.</v>

156
00:09:03.030 --> 00:09:05.520
<v Speaker 1>So for one public spending has to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>cost.</v>

157
00:09:05.521 --> 00:09:06.354
<v Speaker 1>They have to stop the drainage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That has caused such a huge amount of </v>

158
00:09:08.941 --> 00:09:09.350
<v Speaker 1>public</v>

159
00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:10.183
<v Speaker 4>debt.</v>

160
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:13.050
<v Speaker 1>Principal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the new government,</v>

161
00:09:13.051 --> 00:09:15.450
<v Speaker 1>Ricardo Rosales is working on this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

162
00:09:15.451 --> 00:09:18.660
<v Speaker 1>he's committed to decreasing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>government's size by a lot.</v>

163
00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.710
<v Speaker 1>The volume is how he wants to do it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't exactly clear indeed is not really</v>

164
00:09:22.711 --> 00:09:25.500
<v Speaker 1>clear if there's a real political will </v>
<v Speaker 1>to correct the islands.</v>

165
00:09:25.501 --> 00:09:30.501
<v Speaker 1>Massive problem.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Puerto Rico has to turn its economic</v>

166
00:09:31.191 --> 00:09:32.024
<v Speaker 1>policy around and set some serious plans</v>
<v Speaker 1>in motion in order to attract </v>

167
00:09:34.851 --> 00:09:35.684
<v Speaker 1>investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is because Puerto Rico needs </v>

168
00:09:37.281 --> 00:09:38.114
<v Speaker 1>decisive measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It needs real reforms and not just </v>

169
00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:41.343
<v Speaker 1>cosmetically changes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A few things have been done in recent </v>

170
00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:43.911
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

171
00:09:43.911 --> 00:09:46.840
<v Speaker 1>they are trying to defend Puerto Rico </v>
<v Speaker 1>into what kinds of financial center,</v>

172
00:09:46.850 --> 00:09:51.850
<v Speaker 1>the guarantees anonymity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>international investors work,</v>

173
00:09:56.821 --> 00:09:58.710
<v Speaker 1>but there's still a really long way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>go.</v>

174
00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:00.330
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>before we end today's video,</v>

175
00:10:00.331 --> 00:10:03.180
<v Speaker 1>we still have to ask a very important </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

176
00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.120
<v Speaker 1>How on Earth did Puerto Rico get to this</v>
<v Speaker 1>point?</v>

177
00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:07.883
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one reason was that local government </v>

178
00:10:08.861 --> 00:10:09.694
<v Speaker 1>spent huge amounts of money to hire us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw many public workers and to fund </v>

179
00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.080
<v Speaker 1>expensive projects that didn't give the </v>
<v Speaker 1>island anything other than more</v>

180
00:10:16.260 --> 00:10:17.093
<v Speaker 2>debt.</v>

181
00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:21.890
<v Speaker 1>Reason has a lot to do with influence </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the United States,</v>

182
00:10:21.891 --> 00:10:24.770
<v Speaker 1>but that's something we're going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about in an upcoming video.</v>

183
00:10:24.771 --> 00:10:25.604
<v Speaker 1>For now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's your turn because I want to ask a </v>

184
00:10:26.901 --> 00:10:27.734
<v Speaker 1>question of you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think the pressure Rico should </v>

185
00:10:29.631 --> 00:10:30.464
<v Speaker 1>continue to belong to the United States?</v>
<v Speaker 1>So do you think they should seek to </v>

186
00:10:33.201 --> 00:10:34.790
<v Speaker 1>become an independent country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

187
00:10:34.791 --> 00:10:37.530
<v Speaker 1>you can leave your answer in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>comments below as well as in this day,</v>
