<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.050
<v Speaker 2>on the 1st of July of this year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very special anniversary.</v>

3
00:00:11.051 --> 00:00:11.884
<v Speaker 2>We celebrated 20 years has passed since </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong stopped being part of the </v>

4
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 2>United Kingdom and returns to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>People's Republic of China.</v>

5
00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.860
<v Speaker 2>But they did this under the model one </v>
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>

6
00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.390
<v Speaker 2>two systems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>

7
00:00:22.391 --> 00:00:23.224
<v Speaker 2>although China is a dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong was incorporated into the </v>

8
00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:30.760
<v Speaker 2>country as a special administrative </v>
<v Speaker 2>region where the basic law applies.</v>

9
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:31.623
<v Speaker 2>This is a law that grants the citizens </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Hong Kong or a list of rights and </v>

10
00:00:34.361 --> 00:00:35.194
<v Speaker 2>liberties,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which would be unthinkable in the rest </v>

11
00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.700
<v Speaker 2>of China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>perhaps with the exception of Macau.</v>

12
00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.890
<v Speaker 2>Besides this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong has its own currency,</v>

13
00:00:41.891 --> 00:00:44.620
<v Speaker 2>its own immigration policy as well as </v>
<v Speaker 2>its own police,</v>

14
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.410
<v Speaker 2>customs and courts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in its everyday life,</v>

15
00:00:47.411 --> 00:00:50.500
<v Speaker 2>the country works almost as if it were </v>
<v Speaker 2>an independent country.</v>

16
00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:52.173
<v Speaker 2>Just a minute here because I did say </v>
<v Speaker 2>almost Beijing's interference has been </v>

17
00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:57.064
<v Speaker 2>getting more and more intense times.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't think that Beijing is being </v>

18
00:00:59.981 --> 00:01:01.990
<v Speaker 2>discreet about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Not at all.</v>

19
00:01:01.991 --> 00:01:03.580
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already told you about it.</v>

20
00:01:03.581 --> 00:01:04.460
<v Speaker 2>Heroin,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visual policy,</v>

21
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:08.080
<v Speaker 2>how pro-democracy advocates have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>tortured and killed.</v>

22
00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.670
<v Speaker 2>As an interesting aside.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

23
00:01:09.671 --> 00:01:10.504
<v Speaker 2>China has recently kidnapped five </v>
<v Speaker 2>librarians in Hong Kong for spreading </v>

24
00:01:13.391 --> 00:01:15.400
<v Speaker 2>ideas against China's control of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>city.</v>

25
00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:18.130
<v Speaker 2>So in order to celebrate this 20th </v>
<v Speaker 2>anniversary,</v>

26
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.010
<v Speaker 2>Xi Jinping made his first visit to Hong </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kong.</v>

27
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.530
<v Speaker 2>He is the president of China thereafter </v>
<v Speaker 2>rule</v>

28
00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.330
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

29
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.080
<v Speaker 3>see Jinping in Hong Kong.</v>

30
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.600
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

31
00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Changing things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>visit.</v>

32
00:01:30.561 --> 00:01:31.394
<v Speaker 2>Was it loaded with symbolism since it </v>
<v Speaker 2>has happened at a time when China has </v>

33
00:01:34.371 --> 00:01:37.730
<v Speaker 2>been receiving lots and lots of </v>
<v Speaker 2>criticism about Hong Kong,</v>

34
00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:38.623
<v Speaker 2>this visit to view at lost it for three </v>
<v Speaker 2>days and in this short period of time </v>

35
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.650
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese president has decided to </v>
<v Speaker 2>make things pretty clear</v>

36
00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.553
<v Speaker 3>to,</v>
<v Speaker 3>to endanger national sovereignty and </v>

37
00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:50.834
<v Speaker 3>security challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The power of the central government or </v>

38
00:01:52.941 --> 00:01:53.774
<v Speaker 3>use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration </v>
<v Speaker 3>and sabotage activities against the </v>

39
00:01:57.261 --> 00:01:58.094
<v Speaker 3>mainland is an act that crosses the red </v>
<v Speaker 3>line and he's absolutely impermissible </v>

40
00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.133
<v Speaker 3>cgm pain,</v>

41
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.043
<v Speaker 2>in other words for Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All that stuff about freedom of speech </v>

42
00:02:06.361 --> 00:02:07.194
<v Speaker 2>and democracy in Hong Kong has a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>limits and as they are certainly not </v>

43
00:02:11.581 --> 00:02:12.414
<v Speaker 2>going to allow any activist or a </v>
<v Speaker 2>politician to let things get out of </v>

44
00:02:15.241 --> 00:02:17.920
<v Speaker 2>hands and challenge Beijing's control in</v>
<v Speaker 2>any</v>

45
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.913
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

46
00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Xi Jinping doesn't just want to let them</v>

47
00:02:23.431 --> 00:02:25.370
<v Speaker 2>go with a warning.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

48
00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.120
<v Speaker 2>Of trying to also use this visit to </v>
<v Speaker 2>presided over the largest military march</v>

49
00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:36.580
<v Speaker 2>in the history of Hong Kong with Chinese</v>
<v Speaker 2>troops.</v>

50
00:02:36.581 --> 00:02:37.414
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he also used this visit to attends the </v>

51
00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:41.680
<v Speaker 2>inaugural speech of Carrie Lam,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the chief executive of Hong Kong.</v>

52
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:47.360
<v Speaker 1>Aging Pink</v>

53
00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.193
<v Speaker 2>is the Superior Authority and even the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Basic Law clearly forbids him from </v>

54
00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:51.974
<v Speaker 2>meddling in local politics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He did take the opportunity to ask the </v>

55
00:02:54.651 --> 00:02:57.160
<v Speaker 2>new chief executive two things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>First,</v>

56
00:02:57.161 --> 00:02:57.994
<v Speaker 2>he asked about the passing of an anti </v>
<v Speaker 2>subversion law in order to convict all </v>

57
00:03:01.241 --> 00:03:03.450
<v Speaker 2>dissidence he data defend things,</v>
<v Speaker 2>assumptions,</v>

58
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:06.460
<v Speaker 2>democracy or independence for Hong Kong </v>
<v Speaker 2>and seconds.</v>

59
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.720
<v Speaker 2>The approval of a plan of patriotic </v>
<v Speaker 2>education for the youth.</v>

60
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.680
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>

61
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.660
<v Speaker 2>And this is what happens in </v>
<v Speaker 2>dictatorships.</v>

62
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.050
<v Speaker 2>They like their kids to be educated </v>
<v Speaker 2>about their obedience.</v>

63
00:03:17.051 --> 00:03:22.051
<v Speaker 2>To the regime.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So as you can probably imagine,</v>

64
00:03:22.561 --> 00:03:23.394
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we're not particularly willing to do </v>

65
00:03:25.261 --> 00:03:26.094
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And on July the first 60,000 people </v>

66
00:03:28.051 --> 00:03:31.550
<v Speaker 2>demonstrated demanding more freedom and </v>
<v Speaker 2>more democracy</v>

67
00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:33.513
<v Speaker 3>urge the people of Hong Kong do not give</v>
<v Speaker 3>up once we give up than we will for </v>

68
00:03:37.201 --> 00:03:40.720
<v Speaker 3>certain slowly deteriorate into what is </v>
<v Speaker 3>becoming of China today.</v>

69
00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.350
<v Speaker 3>Avery,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I'm the chairman of the League of Social</v>

70
00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:44.450
<v Speaker 3>Democrats.</v>

71
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:47.360
<v Speaker 2>This is what things are like in Hong </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kong and here are visual politic.</v>

72
00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:50.630
<v Speaker 2>We're going to continue to pay close </v>
<v Speaker 2>attention to the developing situation.</v>

73
00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.270
<v Speaker 2>So do not forget to subscribe if you </v>
<v Speaker 2>haven't already.</v>

74
00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.970
<v Speaker 2>So now that this 20th anniversary has </v>
<v Speaker 2>taken place,</v>

75
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.150
<v Speaker 2>there are some questions that we can't </v>
<v Speaker 2>help but ask,</v>

76
00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.520
<v Speaker 2>how did Hong Kong do in the last 20 </v>
<v Speaker 2>years?</v>

77
00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.530
<v Speaker 2>Has It changed much then?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

78
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.660
<v Speaker 2>what is the current situation?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

79
00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.980
<v Speaker 2>let's have a look at all of that.</v>

80
00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.470
<v Speaker 3>Calm.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Is Sill Hong Kong</v>

81
00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.300
<v Speaker 2>best news off to these 20 years?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Is that Hong Kong?</v>

82
00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.163
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still simply is Hong Kong a city </v>

83
00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.250
<v Speaker 2>completely difference compared to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>rest of China?</v>

84
00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:25.240
<v Speaker 2>Let me elaborate on that.</v>

85
00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.113
<v Speaker 1>Swamp</v>

86
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:32.123
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's still the wealthiest and freest </v>

87
00:04:34.021 --> 00:04:36.840
<v Speaker 2>city in China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The course works and media are not under</v>

88
00:04:36.841 --> 00:04:40.080
<v Speaker 2>the control of censorship and political </v>
<v Speaker 2>debates is vibrant.</v>

89
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.080
<v Speaker 2>Vibrant is enough of the facts of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>protests against China.</v>

90
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.670
<v Speaker 2>They're quite frequent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

91
00:04:44.671 --> 00:04:45.504
<v Speaker 2>a demonstration for freedom with more </v>
<v Speaker 2>than 60,000 people against Tszujing </v>

92
00:04:48.361 --> 00:04:50.580
<v Speaker 2>things.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Visits is a good example of this.</v>

93
00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:54.960
<v Speaker 2>Furthermore,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during these years,</v>

94
00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:55.794
<v Speaker 2>economic growth has been an average of </v>
<v Speaker 2>3.3% every year and well this is a </v>

95
00:04:59.731 --> 00:05:00.564
<v Speaker 2>decent figure.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now it might not be as high as in some </v>

96
00:05:02.791 --> 00:05:06.600
<v Speaker 2>other Asian countries like Singapore or </v>
<v Speaker 2>some non Asian countries like Ireland,</v>

97
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.070
<v Speaker 2>but this is still higher than the growth</v>
<v Speaker 2>rate of most rich countries.</v>

98
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.963
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during this time that more than 1 </v>

99
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.290
<v Speaker 2>million Chinese have moved to Hong Kong </v>
<v Speaker 2>in search of it,</v>

100
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:16.133
<v Speaker 2>that's a future.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The city has also cemented his position </v>

101
00:05:18.061 --> 00:05:20.790
<v Speaker 2>as a leading global financial center.</v>

102
00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:22.503
<v Speaker 3>The number of publicly listed companies </v>
<v Speaker 3>on the exchange has increased three </v>

103
00:05:24.881 --> 00:05:25.714
<v Speaker 3>times since 1997 and market </v>
<v Speaker 3>capitalization reached three point 2 </v>

104
00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.700
<v Speaker 3>trillion by 2016 that's equal to almost </v>
<v Speaker 3>all of Germany's GDP.</v>

105
00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.570
<v Speaker 2>I'll stay with 60 million tourists a </v>
<v Speaker 2>year.</v>

106
00:05:36.571 --> 00:05:40.350
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong has also become quite a power </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the tourist sacks.</v>

107
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.210
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hold on for just a second.</v>

108
00:05:42.211 --> 00:05:43.044
<v Speaker 2>Because the country is also showing </v>
<v Speaker 2>symptoms which could indicate that the </v>

109
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:47.310
<v Speaker 2>model is getting obsolete.</v>

110
00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:52.440
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

111
00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.200
<v Speaker 3>downfall of a single model.</v>

112
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.310
<v Speaker 1>It is</v>

113
00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:57.980
<v Speaker 2>true that economic growth on this</v>

114
00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:58.813
<v Speaker 1>island has been decent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also true that it has slowed </v>

115
00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:04.200
<v Speaker 1>down with time for that savings of </v>
<v Speaker 1>collapsed in the future.</v>

116
00:06:04.201 --> 00:06:07.640
<v Speaker 1>It just seems worse and not just for the</v>
<v Speaker 1>political situation.</v>

117
00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:10.760
<v Speaker 1>This is probably the worst time in 20 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years for Hong Kong.</v>

118
00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.833
<v Speaker 1>John's Hong,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Choon wa former financial secretary of </v>

119
00:06:14.211 --> 00:06:17.480
<v Speaker 1>Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There is an increasing feeling that Hong</v>

120
00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.313
<v Speaker 1>Kong hasn't succeeded in adapting to the</v>
<v Speaker 1>modern economic environments or that </v>

121
00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.223
<v Speaker 1>there is a risk of them being a source </v>
<v Speaker 1>of cheap tacky theme park for </v>

122
00:06:25.251 --> 00:06:26.084
<v Speaker 1>businessmen and tourists.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like maybe it's the cities of the </v>

123
00:06:28.341 --> 00:06:29.174
<v Speaker 1>pell river delta where the lack of </v>
<v Speaker 1>drawing from Hong Kong can really be </v>

124
00:06:31.431 --> 00:06:32.264
<v Speaker 1>better understood.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the region which Hong Kong </v>

125
00:06:33.981 --> 00:06:34.814
<v Speaker 1>belongs to you and traditionally the </v>
<v Speaker 1>city has been the center of attention </v>

126
00:06:37.460 --> 00:06:38.510
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This,</v>

127
00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.730
<v Speaker 1>it's just not the case anymore.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

128
00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:44.420
<v Speaker 1>take a look at Shen Zen for example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

129
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.713
<v Speaker 2>Chinese city wasn't nothing but a poor </v>
<v Speaker 2>fishing town of 50,000 inhabitants 50 </v>

130
00:06:49.111 --> 00:06:49.944
<v Speaker 2>years ago.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today the city is actually massive with </v>

131
00:06:52.021 --> 00:06:54.300
<v Speaker 2>a population of more than 15 million </v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

132
00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:59.040
<v Speaker 2>It also has as many companies in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>fortune 500 as Hong Kong is an important</v>

133
00:06:59.041 --> 00:06:59.874
<v Speaker 2>high tech center,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which holds many notable companies like </v>

134
00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:03.353
<v Speaker 2>Penn and</v>

135
00:07:05.110 --> 00:07:06.920
<v Speaker 2>and now many believe that it is Shen </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zen,</v>

136
00:07:06.921 --> 00:07:07.754
<v Speaker 2>not Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>who is destined to be the major player </v>

137
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.950
<v Speaker 2>in the area and also considered this </v>
<v Speaker 2>other stats.</v>

138
00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:16.940
<v Speaker 2>In 1997 Hong Kong represented 20% of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese economy.</v>

139
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.620
<v Speaker 2>Today that figure is less than 3% this </v>
<v Speaker 2>illustrates,</v>

140
00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:21.523
<v Speaker 2>well just how much things are changing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong's economy is stuck with </v>

141
00:07:25.071 --> 00:07:28.280
<v Speaker 2>remarkably little change to show for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>past two decades.</v>

142
00:07:28.460 --> 00:07:29.293
<v Speaker 2>Simon cartlidge and the truth is no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If this has very little to do with luck </v>

143
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.733
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it has made a significant mistakes so </v>

144
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:37.040
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the question might now be,</v>

145
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:38.300
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the major one.</v>

146
00:07:38.330 --> 00:07:40.520
<v Speaker 2>Well these two,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are a great place to start.</v>

147
00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:43.960
<v Speaker 2>First there's the housing markets which </v>
<v Speaker 2>has the hotel design.</v>

148
00:07:44.130 --> 00:07:44.963
<v Speaker 1>Awesome</v>

149
00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:48.530
<v Speaker 2>real estate prices in Hong Kong have </v>
<v Speaker 2>gone through the ceiling.</v>

150
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:49.423
<v Speaker 2>The prices have gone so crazy that most </v>
<v Speaker 2>of its citizens knew that the only </v>

151
00:07:51.951 --> 00:07:55.520
<v Speaker 2>chance they have of getting a house is </v>
<v Speaker 2>to get a public one and the odds of that</v>

152
00:07:55.521 --> 00:07:56.630
<v Speaker 2>happening,</v>
<v Speaker 2>oh really,</v>

153
00:07:56.631 --> 00:07:57.464
<v Speaker 2>really low</v>

154
00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.903
<v Speaker 2>antonoff houses available.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All spaces become very expensive and </v>

155
00:08:02.641 --> 00:08:03.474
<v Speaker 2>this makes it complicated for startups </v>
<v Speaker 2>and new companies to establish </v>

156
00:08:06.181 --> 00:08:10.440
<v Speaker 2>themselves in Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This triggers crazy situations like this</v>

157
00:08:10.441 --> 00:08:11.274
<v Speaker 2>one Hong Kong parking space sells for </v>
<v Speaker 2>record $664,300 and the problem here is </v>

158
00:08:19.291 --> 00:08:21.180
<v Speaker 2>not a lack of lands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>not at all.</v>

159
00:08:21.181 --> 00:08:22.014
<v Speaker 2>In fact less than 25% of Hong Kong </v>
<v Speaker 2>surface area is urbanized and there are </v>

160
00:08:25.681 --> 00:08:29.040
<v Speaker 2>other possibilities like using the seat </v>
<v Speaker 2>plans.</v>

161
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.470
<v Speaker 2>It's really not the issue.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Hong Kong,</v>

162
00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:32.333
<v Speaker 2>it has a very free economy but freest in</v>
<v Speaker 2>the world according to the index of </v>

163
00:08:35.131 --> 00:08:38.670
<v Speaker 2>economic freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it is not free when it comes to land</v>

164
00:08:38.820 --> 00:08:39.653
<v Speaker 2>housing and town planning in Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The governments is the one in charge of </v>

165
00:08:42.811 --> 00:08:43.644
<v Speaker 2>the housing sector and it has become a </v>
<v Speaker 2>complete failure in the last few </v>

166
00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.413
<v Speaker 2>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are over 200 hectares of land </v>

167
00:08:49.531 --> 00:08:51.570
<v Speaker 2>available for building in the urban </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>

168
00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:52.493
<v Speaker 2>The shortage of housing is real,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but that is because of deliberate </v>

169
00:08:54.421 --> 00:08:56.430
<v Speaker 2>manipulation of the market by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>

170
00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:57.833
<v Speaker 2>John White,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a barrister and chairman of Friends of </v>

171
00:09:00.091 --> 00:09:00.924
<v Speaker 2>cycle pay close attention yet because </v>
<v Speaker 2>housing developments have been frozen </v>

172
00:09:03.811 --> 00:09:06.900
<v Speaker 2>because of law from the colonial times </v>
<v Speaker 2>for decades,</v>

173
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:09.960
<v Speaker 2>the local government least farmer's land</v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to grow rice.</v>

174
00:09:09.961 --> 00:09:14.610
<v Speaker 2>These communities support the government</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Beijing and nobody wants to mess with</v>

175
00:09:14.611 --> 00:09:15.444
<v Speaker 2>them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really is a totally crazy system and </v>

176
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.640
<v Speaker 2>some people are suspicious band.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They have good reasons to be.</v>

177
00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.503
<v Speaker 2>The government may have tried to go on a</v>
<v Speaker 2>fever from some oligarchs with big real </v>

178
00:09:24.631 --> 00:09:25.464
<v Speaker 2>estate deals.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Some convictions have actually shown </v>

179
00:09:28.441 --> 00:09:29.274
<v Speaker 2>this corruption and of confirms the </v>
<v Speaker 2>suspicious links between government </v>

180
00:09:32.071 --> 00:09:34.800
<v Speaker 2>workers and the real estate magnets of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong.</v>

181
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.833
<v Speaker 2>This might explain why seven of the 14 </v>
<v Speaker 2>richest real estate investors off from </v>

182
00:09:40.501 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 2>home</v>

183
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:41.663
<v Speaker 1>calm.</v>

184
00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:44.643
<v Speaker 2>This leads us on to another issue and </v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the growing amount of crony </v>

185
00:09:47.681 --> 00:09:48.514
<v Speaker 2>capitalism.</v>

186
00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.380
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

187
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:58.380
<v Speaker 2>Uncertain people agree capitalism has </v>
<v Speaker 2>lost its strength in the last years to a</v>

188
00:10:00.091 --> 00:10:00.924
<v Speaker 2>system with a similar name but a totally</v>
<v Speaker 2>different essence and that system is </v>

189
00:10:04.741 --> 00:10:09.590
<v Speaker 2>crony capitalism.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Under the British,</v>

190
00:10:09.660 --> 00:10:12.230
<v Speaker 2>the government was pro business but not </v>
<v Speaker 2>of business.</v>

191
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.920
<v Speaker 2>Since 1997 business interests have been </v>
<v Speaker 2>baked into the political system.</v>

192
00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:18.860
<v Speaker 2>Conflicts of interest of multiplied </v>
<v Speaker 2>cronyism has grown,</v>

193
00:10:19.740 --> 00:10:20.000
<v Speaker 1>okay</v>

194
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:20.833
<v Speaker 2>in many sectors,</v>
<v Speaker 2>competition has been replaced by well </v>

195
00:10:22.761 --> 00:10:23.594
<v Speaker 2>connected oligopolies and monopolies and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the worst thing is that things are </v>

196
00:10:26.511 --> 00:10:27.344
<v Speaker 2>getting worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was trying to raise regaining its </v>

197
00:10:29.091 --> 00:10:32.030
<v Speaker 2>power in the city as an example of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>liaison office,</v>

198
00:10:32.031 --> 00:10:32.864
<v Speaker 2>which is like the Chinese delegation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is even giving out loans with </v>

199
00:10:35.751 --> 00:10:40.040
<v Speaker 2>better conditions to friendly companies </v>
<v Speaker 2>in order to increase their influence and</v>

200
00:10:40.041 --> 00:10:40.874
<v Speaker 2>their political power and what to know </v>
<v Speaker 2>what's required in order to get one of </v>

201
00:10:43.401 --> 00:10:44.234
<v Speaker 2>these loans well you need to have </v>
<v Speaker 2>connections and some make all of this </v>

202
00:10:48.591 --> 00:10:49.424
<v Speaker 2>worse.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is all surrounded by the political </v>

203
00:10:50.631 --> 00:10:53.030
<v Speaker 2>conflict that we've already told you </v>
<v Speaker 2>about.</v>

204
00:10:53.120 --> 00:10:55.820
<v Speaker 2>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is carry lambs and mission to address</v>

205
00:10:55.821 --> 00:10:59.150
<v Speaker 2>all these problems.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Her legitimacy is also questionable.</v>

206
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.490
<v Speaker 2>After all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>she wasn't elected by the citizens.</v>

207
00:11:01.610 --> 00:11:06.100
<v Speaker 2>She was elected by a group of people who</v>
<v Speaker 2>are led by Beijing's directive.</v>

208
00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:09.370
<v Speaker 1>It's fine.</v>

209
00:11:09.620 --> 00:11:10.453
<v Speaker 2>There was this time of year when Hong </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kong was thought to be the city on the </v>

210
00:11:13.311 --> 00:11:16.010
<v Speaker 2>hill for China's political change.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Unfortunately,</v>

211
00:11:16.011 --> 00:11:19.580
<v Speaker 2>they things look quite different </v>
<v Speaker 2>nowadays and the question becomes,</v>

212
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:22.160
<v Speaker 2>what will the future of Hong Kong be </v>
<v Speaker 2>like?</v>

213
00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:25.040
<v Speaker 2>Will it be in the light?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What would it be in the shadows?</v>

214
00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.240
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now it's your turn.</v>

215
