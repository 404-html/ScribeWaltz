2
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:09.353
<v Speaker 2>on July the first 1997 after 155 years </v>
<v Speaker 2>of British software and see Hong Kong </v>

3
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.693
<v Speaker 2>returned to China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It did so as a special administrative </v>

4
00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:20.550
<v Speaker 2>region under the one country two systems</v>
<v Speaker 2>model.</v>

5
00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.453
<v Speaker 2>A model whose goal was to ensure that </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong would continue being Hong </v>

6
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.433
<v Speaker 2>Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the freest city on the entire Asian </v>

7
00:00:27.391 --> 00:00:28.224
<v Speaker 2>continent.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That means that thanks to this </v>

8
00:00:29.221 --> 00:00:31.860
<v Speaker 2>particular political model,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong has its own laws,</v>

9
00:00:31.861 --> 00:00:34.440
<v Speaker 2>its own justice system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>its own police force,</v>

10
00:00:34.441 --> 00:00:35.274
<v Speaker 2>its own currency and even has its own </v>
<v Speaker 2>customs and immigration policy that is </v>

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:39.623
<v Speaker 2>very different from the rest of China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in the day to day operations of Hong </v>

12
00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:44.483
<v Speaker 2>Kong it will,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's pretty much as an independent </v>

13
00:00:46.231 --> 00:00:47.064
<v Speaker 2>country and well it's going to remain </v>
<v Speaker 2>that way until at least the year 2047 </v>

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:51.923
<v Speaker 2>maybe that's why he's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since Hong Kong passed into Chinese </v>

15
00:00:53.611 --> 00:00:58.611
<v Speaker 2>hands that things have gone pretty well </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the city over the past 20 years.</v>

16
00:00:59.581 --> 00:01:02.460
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong's economy has grown by an </v>
<v Speaker 2>average of 3.3%</v>

17
00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:02.670
<v Speaker 2>pay.</v>

18
00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.503
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>More than 1 million people have moved </v>

19
00:01:04.711 --> 00:01:05.544
<v Speaker 2>from mainland China to this territory in</v>
<v Speaker 2>search of fortune and the city is still </v>

20
00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.610
<v Speaker 2>an oasis of freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

21
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:13.553
<v Speaker 2>the influence and the interference of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Chinese government's in local </v>

22
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:19.410
<v Speaker 2>politics has grown a lot in recent </v>
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>

23
00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:20.244
<v Speaker 2>Now here on visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we already talked about this for </v>

24
00:01:22.531 --> 00:01:23.364
<v Speaker 2>example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then past videos we discussed the </v>

25
00:01:25.291 --> 00:01:26.124
<v Speaker 2>umbrella revolution and Beijing's </v>
<v Speaker 2>growing interference in local politics </v>

26
00:01:29.431 --> 00:01:30.810
<v Speaker 2>swells the viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the video.</v>

27
00:01:30.811 --> 00:01:34.230
<v Speaker 2>Today we're going to talk about another </v>
<v Speaker 2>standout feature of this place.</v>

28
00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.093
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>did you know that Hong Kong is the city </v>

29
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:40.860
<v Speaker 2>with some of the most expensive and also</v>
<v Speaker 2>the smallest houses in the world?</v>

30
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.890
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen up a rising market,</v>

31
00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.800
<v Speaker 2>seven and a half million inhabitants and</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 1,200</v>

32
00:01:55.801 --> 00:01:56.634
<v Speaker 2>skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>homes and Hong Kong are terribly </v>

33
00:01:58.651 --> 00:02:00.980
<v Speaker 2>expensive and it's not just homes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>garages,</v>

34
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.823
<v Speaker 2>officers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and anything else that has to do with </v>

35
00:02:03.241 --> 00:02:05.940
<v Speaker 2>the real estate sector is incredibly </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive.</v>

36
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.270
<v Speaker 2>So much so that we can find news like </v>
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>

37
00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.680
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong parking spots sold for record,</v>
<v Speaker 2>600,000</v>

38
00:02:13.681 --> 00:02:15.020
<v Speaker 2>US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

39
00:02:15.021 --> 00:02:15.854
<v Speaker 2>so let's assume that you have $1 million</v>
<v Speaker 2>and you wanted to buy apartments in one </v>

40
00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:22.500
<v Speaker 2>of the cities in nicer areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

41
00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:23.334
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd barely be able to afford a 22 </v>

42
00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:25.854
<v Speaker 2>square meters or 236 square feet,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and that's for $1 million when </v>

43
00:02:29.671 --> 00:02:30.504
<v Speaker 2>considering cities with the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>expensive premium homes in the world's </v>

44
00:02:33.331 --> 00:02:36.380
<v Speaker 2>Pong Kong places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Second only behind Monaco,</v>

45
00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.860
<v Speaker 2>Alibaba,</v>
<v Speaker 2>chief biases own Aladdin's cave jack mob</v>

46
00:02:40.861 --> 00:02:41.694
<v Speaker 2>purchases.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong's most expensive home for 193 </v>

47
00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.220
<v Speaker 2>million US dollars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But of course if we take into account,</v>

48
00:02:47.221 --> 00:02:48.054
<v Speaker 2>but all kinds of people live in Hong </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kong and skip and Monica is very </v>

49
00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:51.084
<v Speaker 2>particular case.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong is by far the city with the </v>

50
00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:55.710
<v Speaker 2>most expensive homes in the wells.</v>

51
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.010
<v Speaker 1>It's giving you an</v>

52
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.843
<v Speaker 2>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Since 2003 the price of housing in Hong </v>

53
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:04.143
<v Speaker 2>Kong has risen by 450% and today the </v>
<v Speaker 2>average price per square meter exceeds </v>

54
00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.350
<v Speaker 2>$16,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's the equivalence of $1,486</v>

55
00:03:14.351 --> 00:03:15.470
<v Speaker 2>per square foot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>

56
00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 2>That means that if you want to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 2>normal 90 square meter house,</v>

57
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.803
<v Speaker 2>nothing particularly fancy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you have to pay at the very least one </v>

58
00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 2>point $5 million,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is quite the mortgage.</v>

59
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.150
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's very common to compare which cities</v>

60
00:03:28.151 --> 00:03:28.984
<v Speaker 2>are more or less accessible by counting </v>
<v Speaker 2>how many years of average wages before </v>

61
00:03:32.681 --> 00:03:35.680
<v Speaker 2>taxes we need to buy an average home.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

62
00:03:35.681 --> 00:03:40.681
<v Speaker 2>so let's have a look at Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>According to the latest data,</v>

63
00:03:41.111 --> 00:03:41.944
<v Speaker 2>in order to buy a house in Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you'd need more than 18 years of full </v>

64
00:03:45.881 --> 00:03:49.360
<v Speaker 2>wages for comparison in cities like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Tokyo or Singapore,</v>

65
00:03:49.361 --> 00:03:54.280
<v Speaker 2>one needs less than five years of wages.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

66
00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:58.240
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong's situation is totally crazy </v>
<v Speaker 2>and not only that,</v>

67
00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.020
<v Speaker 2>since prosperity is so expensive and </v>
<v Speaker 2>inaccessible,</v>

68
00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:01.883
<v Speaker 2>the Hong Kong zone citizens,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they've had to buy smaller and smaller </v>

69
00:04:04.511 --> 00:04:05.050
<v Speaker 2>homes.</v>

70
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.080
<v Speaker 2>And speaking of small homes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>could you guess what the average surface</v>

71
00:04:08.081 --> 00:04:10.930
<v Speaker 2>area for a home in Hong Kong,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's,</v>

72
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.400
<v Speaker 2>what would you guess a hundred square </v>
<v Speaker 2>meters,</v>

73
00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.000
<v Speaker 2>80 60 well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all of those figures are sky high.</v>

74
00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.920
<v Speaker 2>The reality is that that's 42 square </v>
<v Speaker 2>meters or 452 square feet.</v>

75
00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:23.410
<v Speaker 2>Can you imagine living in a house that </v>
<v Speaker 2>small?</v>

76
00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.580
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in that case,</v>

77
00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:25.473
<v Speaker 2>check out the latest trends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong is so expensive that </v>

78
00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:33.460
<v Speaker 2>architects are building a hundred square</v>
<v Speaker 2>foot tube homes made from concrete water</v>

79
00:04:33.461 --> 00:04:34.330
<v Speaker 2>pipes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>ra,</v>

80
00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:36.580
<v Speaker 2>ra.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So some of you might now be thinking,</v>

81
00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:37.301
<v Speaker 2>well wow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Simon,</v>

82
00:04:37.301 --> 00:04:38.134
<v Speaker 2>that's really small,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but I'm pretty sure that's because </v>

83
00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:43.930
<v Speaker 2>people live alone in tiny apartments,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which alters the statistics,</v>

84
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.100
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

85
00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.600
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On average,</v>

86
00:04:46.601 --> 00:04:51.601
<v Speaker 2>almost three people live in a 42 square </v>
<v Speaker 2>meter or 425 square feet apartments,</v>

87
00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.350
<v Speaker 2>which is pretty darn insane.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And it's not only the homes.</v>

88
00:04:56.351 --> 00:04:57.880
<v Speaker 2>The same thing happens with officers.</v>

89
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.360
<v Speaker 1>Awesome.</v>

90
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.820
<v Speaker 2>Him skyscrapers sells for record of 5.2</v>
<v Speaker 2>billion US dollars.</v>

91
00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:13.080
<v Speaker 2>But of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having said that,</v>

92
00:05:13.081 --> 00:05:14.640
<v Speaker 2>you might now be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

93
00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:17.850
<v Speaker 2>why the Hell Oh homes so expensive in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong?</v>

94
00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:18.960
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>listen up.</v>

95
00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:29.270
<v Speaker 2>The lack of land,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a myth,</v>

96
00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:32.213
<v Speaker 2>massive skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>tiny end ludicrously expensive </v>

97
00:05:34.561 --> 00:05:35.394
<v Speaker 2>apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how we could pretty much </v>

98
00:05:37.081 --> 00:05:39.060
<v Speaker 2>describe Hong Kong.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Don't you agree?</v>

99
00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:39.781
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>after all,</v>

100
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:43.980
<v Speaker 2>we're talking about one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 2>densely populated places in the world.</v>

101
00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.050
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so many people very,</v>

102
00:05:49.051 --> 00:05:52.710
<v Speaker 2>this'll space pretty much a perfect </v>
<v Speaker 2>combination for super high prices.</v>

103
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:53.573
<v Speaker 2>Right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

104
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.160
<v Speaker 2>hold on just a moment because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

105
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:57.563
<v Speaker 2>this is not the whole truth.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that less than 25% of that </v>

106
00:06:02.861 --> 00:06:03.694
<v Speaker 2>is a quarter of Hong Kong's territory is</v>
<v Speaker 2>urbanized and only 7% of the entire </v>

107
00:06:07.661 --> 00:06:11.650
<v Speaker 2>territory is occupied by urban housing </v>
<v Speaker 2>outside the crowded areas,</v>

108
00:06:11.651 --> 00:06:13.330
<v Speaker 2>we find countryside,</v>
<v Speaker 2>jungle,</v>

109
00:06:13.331 --> 00:06:14.910
<v Speaker 2>old villages,</v>
<v Speaker 2>golf courses,</v>

110
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.560
<v Speaker 2>and many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many single family homes.</v>

111
00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:21.110
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

112
00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:22.740
<v Speaker 2>alrighty.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then so well,</v>

113
00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:25.160
<v Speaker 2>how is this possible?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why don't you see it?</v>

114
00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:26.003
<v Speaker 2>For years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong was considered to be the </v>

115
00:06:27.331 --> 00:06:28.164
<v Speaker 2>freest economy in the entire world </v>
<v Speaker 2>according to the index of economic </v>

116
00:06:32.071 --> 00:06:32.904
<v Speaker 2>freedom.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a place with low </v>

117
00:06:33.781 --> 00:06:35.010
<v Speaker 2>taxes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>free trade,</v>

118
00:06:35.011 --> 00:06:38.910
<v Speaker 2>legal security as a very small amounts </v>
<v Speaker 2>of government intervention.</v>

119
00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.060
<v Speaker 2>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong is a highly capitalist city.</v>

120
00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.230
<v Speaker 2>That's why it's the third largest </v>
<v Speaker 2>financial center in the world after only</v>

121
00:06:46.290 --> 00:06:48.060
<v Speaker 2>London and New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>by the way,</v>

122
00:06:48.061 --> 00:06:49.560
<v Speaker 2>fun fact here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Basic Law.</v>

123
00:06:49.561 --> 00:06:50.394
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong's constitution limits the </v>
<v Speaker 2>government so that it can't spend more </v>

124
00:06:53.341 --> 00:06:54.174
<v Speaker 2>than it makes.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that the government usually </v>

125
00:06:55.831 --> 00:06:58.410
<v Speaker 2>closes every year with a surplus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

126
00:06:58.411 --> 00:06:59.244
<v Speaker 2>this has led it to save so much surplus </v>
<v Speaker 2>that it has over $220 billion in </v>

127
00:07:03.991 --> 00:07:04.830
<v Speaker 2>reserve.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.080
<v Speaker 2>Unlike many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many other countries around the world,</v>

129
00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:09.690
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong does not have public debt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

130
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:12.060
<v Speaker 2>but fun facts assigned,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let us continue.</v>

131
00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:12.983
<v Speaker 2>The fact is that despite so much freedom</v>
<v Speaker 2>and so much commitment to capitalism as </v>

132
00:07:16.681 --> 00:07:17.514
<v Speaker 2>a sector in which the government has </v>
<v Speaker 2>intervenes a lot and I am betting </v>

133
00:07:21.331 --> 00:07:22.164
<v Speaker 2>because you've been watching this video </v>
<v Speaker 2>for some time now that you can probably </v>

134
00:07:24.211 --> 00:07:27.510
<v Speaker 2>guess what that is.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

135
00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:28.373
<v Speaker 2>it is the real estate sector.</v>
<v Speaker 2>You see the government owns practically </v>

136
00:07:31.260 --> 00:07:33.090
<v Speaker 2>all of the lands in Hong Kong.</v>

137
00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:39.970
<v Speaker 2>Governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Authorities control how much land is put</v>

138
00:07:39.971 --> 00:07:40.804
<v Speaker 2>on the market and when it can be built </v>
<v Speaker 2>upon and of course if the development </v>

139
00:07:43.931 --> 00:07:44.764
<v Speaker 2>bureau decides what Cam and what cannot </v>
<v Speaker 2>be built now generally lands </v>

140
00:07:48.491 --> 00:07:50.680
<v Speaker 2>concessions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They're given through auctions.</v>

141
00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.610
<v Speaker 2>These are generally for private homes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>offices or commercial uses.</v>

142
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:55.473
<v Speaker 2>All.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are done directly through </v>

143
00:07:55.961 --> 00:07:56.794
<v Speaker 2>agreements with developers when public </v>
<v Speaker 2>housing with lower rental prices is </v>

144
00:07:59.621 --> 00:08:00.454
<v Speaker 2>going to be built,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is where a large part of Hong </v>

145
00:08:03.070 --> 00:08:03.903
<v Speaker 2>Kong's population live</v>

146
00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.103
<v Speaker 2>and it's normal even in auctions for the</v>
<v Speaker 2>property to continue being government </v>

147
00:08:12.771 --> 00:08:17.570
<v Speaker 2>property as they are granted a right of </v>
<v Speaker 2>use for an unspecified number of years.</v>

148
00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.463
<v Speaker 2>So sure homes being so expensive in Hong</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kong has a lot to do with scarcity but </v>

149
00:08:22.041 --> 00:08:25.070
<v Speaker 2>it's not due to eight geographical </v>
<v Speaker 2>shortage.</v>

150
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:28.040
<v Speaker 2>It's due to governmental decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making.</v>

151
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 2>There's plenty of land to develop new </v>
<v Speaker 2>residential and office areas and there's</v>

152
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.430
<v Speaker 2>always the option of gaining ground at </v>
<v Speaker 2>sea.</v>

153
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.211
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Hong Kong,</v>

154
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:40.940
<v Speaker 2>reclaiming land from the sea is not a </v>
<v Speaker 2>strange thing to do.</v>

155
00:08:40.941 --> 00:08:41.774
<v Speaker 2>Indeed a quarter of all the built up </v>
<v Speaker 2>areas of Hong Kong are on land that was </v>

156
00:08:44.781 --> 00:08:46.970
<v Speaker 2>reclaimed from the seat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the government,</v>

157
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:52.060
<v Speaker 2>they decide absolutely everything.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shortage of land is a myth.</v>

158
00:08:52.850 --> 00:08:53.683
<v Speaker 2>There are over 200 hectares of land </v>
<v Speaker 2>available for building in the urban </v>

159
00:08:56.821 --> 00:08:58.860
<v Speaker 2>areas.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The shortage of housing is real,</v>

160
00:08:58.861 --> 00:08:59.694
<v Speaker 2>but that is because of deliberate </v>
<v Speaker 2>manipulation of the market by the </v>

161
00:09:02.371 --> 00:09:03.204
<v Speaker 2>government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>John Right Barrister and chairman of </v>

162
00:09:05.161 --> 00:09:06.980
<v Speaker 2>Friends of cycle.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

163
00:09:07.050 --> 00:09:09.090
<v Speaker 2>in recent decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as we mentioned before,</v>

164
00:09:09.091 --> 00:09:09.924
<v Speaker 2>Hong Kong's population has grown a lot </v>
<v Speaker 2>because many people have come in from </v>

165
00:09:12.511 --> 00:09:13.620
<v Speaker 2>China.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In addition,</v>

166
00:09:13.621 --> 00:09:17.880
<v Speaker 2>family size has decreased and many </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chinese investors want to invest in this</v>

167
00:09:17.881 --> 00:09:20.130
<v Speaker 2>city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is known for its legal security.</v>

168
00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:22.813
<v Speaker 1>Hello,</v>

169
00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.500
<v Speaker 2>this has led to a rise in demands.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burton not supply.</v>

170
00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:30.250
<v Speaker 2>This is simply because the government </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't want to do it.</v>

171
00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:34.570
<v Speaker 2>Palm prices will continue to grow due to</v>
<v Speaker 2>limited supply.</v>

172
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:37.570
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Lamb,</v>
<v Speaker 2>senior director at night to frank.</v>

173
00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:39.690
<v Speaker 2>Well now the question has to be,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

174
00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:40.533
<v Speaker 2>why is the government interested in </v>
<v Speaker 2>restricting supply and increasing </v>

175
00:09:43.421 --> 00:09:44.620
<v Speaker 2>prices?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

176
00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:45.483
<v Speaker 2>there are at least two reasons.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first is that auctions are a great </v>

177
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:52.120
<v Speaker 2>business for the public pass.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In 2017 for example,</v>

178
00:09:52.121 --> 00:09:52.954
<v Speaker 2>one out of every $5 from public revenues</v>
<v Speaker 2>came from the sale of lands and we're </v>

179
00:09:56.501 --> 00:10:01.501
<v Speaker 2>talking here about $15 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The second reason,</v>

180
00:10:02.051 --> 00:10:02.884
<v Speaker 2>which is much more sinister is that </v>
<v Speaker 2>there are suspicions of not very clean </v>

181
00:10:06.791 --> 00:10:09.820
<v Speaker 2>relations between the authorities and </v>
<v Speaker 2>large promoters,</v>

182
00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.713
<v Speaker 2>and in some cases,</v>
<v Speaker 2>these suspicions have led to </v>

183
00:10:13.700 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 2>convictions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Calm property magnate,</v>

184
00:10:17.311 --> 00:10:20.070
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Kwok back in jail for bribing </v>
<v Speaker 2>cities.</v>

185
00:10:20.100 --> 00:10:20.933
<v Speaker 2>Number two official,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you see the real estate sector in Hong </v>

186
00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:24.083
<v Speaker 2>Kong is held in very few hands,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hands that belonged do </v>

187
00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:28.920
<v Speaker 2>multibillionaires.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

188
00:10:28.921 --> 00:10:33.600
<v Speaker 2>17 of the 14 biggest estate magnates in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Asia are from this city.</v>

189
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:39.273
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

190
00:10:39.620 --> 00:10:40.453
<v Speaker 2>And well these big businessmen preferred</v>
<v Speaker 2>to keep prices sky high and avoid </v>

191
00:10:44.271 --> 00:10:45.104
<v Speaker 2>competition.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's something that happens when the </v>

192
00:10:46.251 --> 00:10:47.084
<v Speaker 2>government brings various Atlanta market</v>
<v Speaker 2>and see in addition increases any new </v>

193
00:10:50.511 --> 00:10:52.220
<v Speaker 2>projects,</v>
<v Speaker 2>bureaucracy that way.</v>

194
00:10:52.221 --> 00:10:53.054
<v Speaker 2>Small and medium sized enterprises,</v>
<v Speaker 2>contents of the market and foreign </v>

195
00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:59.690
<v Speaker 2>companies simply don't dare to because </v>
<v Speaker 2>that have a clear disadvantage.</v>

196
00:10:59.740 --> 00:11:02.090
<v Speaker 2>And of course if you are,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as you might imagine,</v>

197
00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.790
<v Speaker 2>all of this has pretty severe </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

198
00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.393
<v Speaker 2>The consequences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the crazy price of housing has meant </v>

199
00:11:18.781 --> 00:11:21.750
<v Speaker 2>that despite having a lot of employments</v>
<v Speaker 2>in high wages,</v>

200
00:11:21.751 --> 00:11:22.584
<v Speaker 2>many people live in difficult conditions</v>
<v Speaker 2>like families having to live in 40 </v>

201
00:11:25.561 --> 00:11:26.394
<v Speaker 2>square meters,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's 431 square feet homes while </v>

202
00:11:28.841 --> 00:11:30.380
<v Speaker 2>paying exorbitant Morgan.</v>

203
00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:32.380
<v Speaker 1>This is</v>

204
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:33.213
<v Speaker 2>system has also led many people,</v>
<v Speaker 2>especially the youngest ones do depends </v>

205
00:11:36.611 --> 00:11:39.610
<v Speaker 2>on the government's public housing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as you might imagine,</v>

206
00:11:39.611 --> 00:11:40.444
<v Speaker 2>these are particularly small and do </v>
<v Speaker 2>remember that in Hong Kong there's no </v>

207
00:11:43.571 --> 00:11:44.404
<v Speaker 2>chance of living on the outskirts or in </v>
<v Speaker 2>remote areas because that would mean </v>

208
00:11:47.381 --> 00:11:48.214
<v Speaker 2>crossing over to mainland China and </v>
<v Speaker 2>losing all of the freedoms that people </v>

209
00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:56.700
<v Speaker 2>have in this city as if that was not </v>
<v Speaker 2>enough.</v>

210
00:11:56.771 --> 00:11:57.604
<v Speaker 2>The high price of officers and business </v>
<v Speaker 2>buildings has caused many companies and </v>

211
00:12:00.311 --> 00:12:01.144
<v Speaker 2>too many investments do you end up in </v>
<v Speaker 2>other cities if the Powell river delta </v>

212
00:12:03.950 --> 00:12:07.210
<v Speaker 2>such Shenzhen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which poses problems for the future,</v>

213
00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:12.610
<v Speaker 2>but that is a whole of year that we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could do another time.</v>

214
00:12:12.611 --> 00:12:13.630
<v Speaker 2>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's a viewer.</v>

215
00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:14.493
<v Speaker 2>That's how things are in the city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This until now has been one of the most </v>

216
00:12:17.471 --> 00:12:19.900
<v Speaker 2>prominent beacons of prosperity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>freedom in Asia.</v>

217
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:24.250
<v Speaker 2>Only the future is going to tell us </v>
<v Speaker 2>whether this will continue to be,</v>

218
00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:25.210
<v Speaker 2>and you know what?</v>

219
00:12:25.210 --> 00:12:27.910
<v Speaker 2>We're going to be keeping a very close </v>
<v Speaker 2>tie her official politic,</v>

220
00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:28.773
<v Speaker 2>but now it's your turn.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think that Hong Kong's </v>

221
00:12:30.191 --> 00:12:34.060
<v Speaker 2>authorities should encourage growth by </v>
<v Speaker 2>increasing the supply of real estate?</v>
