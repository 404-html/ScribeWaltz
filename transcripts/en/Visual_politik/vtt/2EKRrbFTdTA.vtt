1
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.903
<v Speaker 1>In 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it'll be 70 years since India broke off </v>

2
00:00:11.611 --> 00:00:14.460
<v Speaker 1>from the British empire and became an </v>
<v Speaker 1>independent country,</v>

3
00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.000
<v Speaker 1>which is today actually the largest </v>
<v Speaker 1>democracy in the world.</v>

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:18.923
<v Speaker 1>In these 70 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India has managed to implement a </v>

5
00:00:20.701 --> 00:00:25.320
<v Speaker 1>political system with more than 1000 </v>
<v Speaker 1>parties and high female participation.</v>

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.210
<v Speaker 1>That is totally unprecedented in such a </v>
<v Speaker 1>poor</v>

7
00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.083
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

8
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.323
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we should probably wait before we pop </v>

9
00:00:34.561 --> 00:00:35.394
<v Speaker 1>the champagne because we can't exactly </v>
<v Speaker 1>say that these 70 years of independence </v>

10
00:00:38.641 --> 00:00:39.474
<v Speaker 1>have gone brilliantly in this gigantic </v>
<v Speaker 1>country of more than one point 2 </v>

11
00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.110
<v Speaker 1>billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What's the equality?</v>

12
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:46.944
<v Speaker 1>A terrible cost system and many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many problems with women's rights have </v>

13
00:00:50.641 --> 00:00:54.990
<v Speaker 1>continued to shake this nation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's for wars with Pakistan,</v>

14
00:00:54.991 --> 00:00:57.530
<v Speaker 1>which has become something of a arch </v>
<v Speaker 1>enemy.</v>

15
00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.800
<v Speaker 1>but if you really want to know why we </v>
<v Speaker 1>might claim that India can't be proud of</v>

17
00:01:04.801 --> 00:01:06.270
<v Speaker 1>the last 70 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

18
00:01:06.271 --> 00:01:11.220
<v Speaker 1>we only need to compare this country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>evolution with that of China Sea.</v>

19
00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:15.020
<v Speaker 1>When Dung shopping launched his policy </v>
<v Speaker 1>to open up China to the world and change</v>

20
00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.100
<v Speaker 1>the economic model back in the 19 </v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties,</v>

21
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.850
<v Speaker 1>the sizes of these two economic giants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and India,</v>

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.490
<v Speaker 1>they were similar in 2016.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

23
00:01:23.491 --> 00:01:26.250
<v Speaker 1>the China's GDP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was five times higher.</v>

24
00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.340
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just check out this</v>

25
00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.373
<v Speaker 2>graph</v>

26
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.040
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>these differences repeats in practically</v>

27
00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.260
<v Speaker 1>every statistic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>social and economic and Tobias,</v>

28
00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:40.290
<v Speaker 1>another example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

29
00:01:40.291 --> 00:01:43.870
<v Speaker 1>while China's illiteracy rate affects </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than four percent of the population</v>

30
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.733
<v Speaker 1>in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost a one out of every three people </v>

31
00:01:46.931 --> 00:01:51.931
<v Speaker 1>can't read or write.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Considering all this,</v>

32
00:01:53.611 --> 00:01:54.444
<v Speaker 1>we should almost reached the conclusion </v>
<v Speaker 1>that the only good thing that this </v>

33
00:01:56.581 --> 00:01:58.080
<v Speaker 1>country has achieved,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it hasn't been.</v>

34
00:01:58.081 --> 00:01:59.310
<v Speaker 1>It's democracy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

35
00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:00.653
<v Speaker 1>Just a second,</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it seems that this poverty and </v>

36
00:02:02.581 --> 00:02:07.581
<v Speaker 1>injustice is beginning to shift for </v>
<v Speaker 1>experts,</v>

37
00:02:10.501 --> 00:02:14.910
<v Speaker 1>so betting that the 21st century will be</v>
<v Speaker 1>above all India century.</v>

38
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.950
<v Speaker 1>That is to say that in the next few </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>

39
00:02:16.951 --> 00:02:17.784
<v Speaker 1>we'll witness how this country emerges </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the developing world to become an </v>

40
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.983
<v Speaker 1>economic superpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many companies such as Amazon and apple </v>

41
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.103
<v Speaker 1>already betting on this transformation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends up paying close attention to this </v>

42
00:02:28.381 --> 00:02:32.280
<v Speaker 1>huge market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They understand that if expectations are</v>

43
00:02:32.281 --> 00:02:35.820
<v Speaker 1>mess in the next few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could see one of the biggest business</v>

44
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:37.170
<v Speaker 1>opportunities in history.</v>

45
00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.510
<v Speaker 2>Great,</v>

46
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.593
<v Speaker 1>and it's not just companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Deli government's own expectations </v>

47
00:02:43.611 --> 00:02:44.444
<v Speaker 1>are so high that they expect this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's transformation to be at least </v>

48
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.150
<v Speaker 1>as impressive as that of China in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming decades.</v>

49
00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.380
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they want to be prepared.</v>

50
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.030
<v Speaker 1>They are contemplating,</v>
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>

51
00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:59.120
<v Speaker 1>building 250 airports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>six new macro reports,</v>

52
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 1>and creating more than $150,</v>
<v Speaker 1>million new and accessible homes in the </v>

53
00:03:03.581 --> 00:03:08.470
<v Speaker 1>next 10 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

54
00:03:08.471 --> 00:03:11.440
<v Speaker 1>everything indicates that we may see </v>
<v Speaker 1>India's takeoff,</v>

55
00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.333
<v Speaker 1>which,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

56
00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.020
<v Speaker 1>that's got to be a good thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

57
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.913
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you keep one thing in mind and that </v>

58
00:03:15.551 --> 00:03:18.400
<v Speaker 1>is the Beijing doesn't like this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They don't like it at all.</v>

59
00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.680
<v Speaker 1>Crust and resentment</v>

60
00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:33.770
<v Speaker 1>is India's main trading partner.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

61
00:03:33.771 --> 00:03:34.604
<v Speaker 1>despite this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese authorities look at India's </v>

62
00:03:36.291 --> 00:03:37.910
<v Speaker 1>growing economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

63
00:03:37.911 --> 00:03:40.730
<v Speaker 1>and military capacity with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>distrust.</v>

64
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:41.593
<v Speaker 1>This is because this is a time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>China wants to gain political influence </v>

65
00:03:44.361 --> 00:03:46.910
<v Speaker 1>and this change in India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't suit them at all.</v>

66
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.813
<v Speaker 1>India is perhaps the only country in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia with enough potential to offset </v>

67
00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:53.390
<v Speaker 1>China's political power in the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After all,</v>

68
00:03:53.391 --> 00:03:54.224
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about what will soon be </v>
<v Speaker 1>the most populated country on earth and </v>

69
00:03:57.021 --> 00:04:00.470
<v Speaker 1>there's even some analysts who confirmed</v>
<v Speaker 1>that maybe this has already happened,</v>

70
00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.460
<v Speaker 1>but India has already surpassed China in</v>
<v Speaker 1>terms of population size,</v>

71
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:07.940
<v Speaker 1>but it isn't only that because of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>one child policy that affected China for</v>

72
00:04:07.941 --> 00:04:08.774
<v Speaker 1>so many years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India's population has and will have </v>

73
00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.180
<v Speaker 1>more young people and less elderly </v>
<v Speaker 1>people,</v>

74
00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:17.990
<v Speaker 1>which is quite a significant advantage </v>
<v Speaker 1>given these circumstances.</v>

75
00:04:17.991 --> 00:04:20.930
<v Speaker 1>It's easy to understand Beijing's </v>
<v Speaker 1>distrust of India.</v>

76
00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:26.110
<v Speaker 1>Then you agree India has the fastest </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing economy in the world.</v>

77
00:04:26.331 --> 00:04:27.164
<v Speaker 1>We hope we're going to be catching it </v>
<v Speaker 1>very soon in terms of percentage </v>

78
00:04:29.271 --> 00:04:31.790
<v Speaker 1>increase.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I have to tell you that we're working on</v>

79
00:04:31.791 --> 00:04:32.624
<v Speaker 1>it now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't think that this feeling only </v>

80
00:04:34.551 --> 00:04:37.130
<v Speaker 1>exists in political officers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not at all.</v>

81
00:04:37.131 --> 00:04:37.964
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this growing rivalry is actually also </v>

82
00:04:40.071 --> 00:04:42.550
<v Speaker 1>reflected on the streets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Consider the following data.</v>

83
00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.180
<v Speaker 1>According to a survey published in 2016 </v>
<v Speaker 1>by the Pew Research Center that only one</v>

84
00:04:49.181 --> 00:04:53.590
<v Speaker 1>in four Chinese people have a favorable </v>
<v Speaker 1>opinion of India and in India things are</v>

85
00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:54.424
<v Speaker 1>not more encouraging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seven out of every 10 are worried about </v>

86
00:04:57.251 --> 00:04:58.084
<v Speaker 1>Beijing's military drive and believe </v>
<v Speaker 1>that China's economic influence is </v>

87
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:02.290
<v Speaker 1>hurting them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

88
00:05:02.291 --> 00:05:03.124
<v Speaker 1>it seems that both China and India as </v>
<v Speaker 1>populations know that their neighbors </v>

89
00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.900
<v Speaker 1>are also.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They're great</v>

90
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:07.823
<v Speaker 2>rivals.</v>

91
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.260
<v Speaker 1>In any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>curiously,</v>

92
00:05:12.270 --> 00:05:14.640
<v Speaker 1>it must be said that despite all of this</v>
<v Speaker 1>rivalry,</v>

93
00:05:14.641 --> 00:05:16.890
<v Speaker 1>Bollywood is actually quite popular in </v>
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>

94
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:21.690
<v Speaker 1>This summer we saw how dangle and Indian</v>
<v Speaker 1>blockbuster swept the Chinese box office</v>

95
00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:22.553
<v Speaker 1>and it became one of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>grossing films in China of all time and </v>

96
00:05:26.371 --> 00:05:27.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

97
00:05:27.391 --> 00:05:29.670
<v Speaker 1>this is something that the government in</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing,</v>

98
00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:33.540
<v Speaker 1>they do really like that much in terms </v>
<v Speaker 1>of soft power.</v>

99
00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:34.463
<v Speaker 1>India has done better than China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>although India's economy is not as </v>

100
00:05:36.961 --> 00:05:39.780
<v Speaker 1>developed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've put a huge emphasis on promoting</v>

101
00:05:39.781 --> 00:05:41.920
<v Speaker 1>their culture.</v>
<v Speaker 1>John Jean Cui,</v>

102
00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.230
<v Speaker 1>director of the Southeast Asian Research</v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute at Peking University.</v>

103
00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:47.093
<v Speaker 1>Well anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be great if all tensions </v>

104
00:05:48.511 --> 00:05:50.550
<v Speaker 1>occurred in let's see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>such a peaceful way,</v>

105
00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.443
<v Speaker 1>but unfortunately that is not the case.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Disputes in is while everyone was </v>

106
00:06:05.281 --> 00:06:06.114
<v Speaker 1>looking at Pyong Yang and the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean nuclear crisis occupied every </v>

107
00:06:09.151 --> 00:06:09.984
<v Speaker 1>front page,</v>
<v Speaker 1>another political crisis when it was </v>

108
00:06:11.641 --> 00:06:12.474
<v Speaker 1>about to explode,</v>

109
00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.933
<v Speaker 1>happens in the Himalayas more than 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>meters above sea level in one of the </v>

110
00:06:19.301 --> 00:06:20.134
<v Speaker 1>most remote places on earth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That dockland plateau in this place </v>

111
00:06:24.101 --> 00:06:27.790
<v Speaker 1>between June and August,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of the most serious political crises</v>

112
00:06:27.791 --> 00:06:28.624
<v Speaker 1>between China and India in the last 55 </v>
<v Speaker 1>years occurred when Chinese troops </v>

113
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.870
<v Speaker 1>invaded northern India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

114
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:35.770
<v Speaker 1>on June the eighth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>

115
00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.633
<v Speaker 1>a squad of Chinese border guards into </v>
<v Speaker 1>construction team entered the territory </v>

116
00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.090
<v Speaker 1>that is disputed between China and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small closed kingdom of time.</v>

117
00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:48.280
<v Speaker 1>That is the country with the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>gross national happiness.</v>

118
00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:49.450
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is something.</v>

119
00:06:49.451 --> 00:06:51.530
<v Speaker 1>We will certainly be discussing it a </v>
<v Speaker 1>video someday,</v>

120
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:52.443
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that the Chinese unit's </v>

121
00:06:53.831 --> 00:06:56.920
<v Speaker 1>destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Several bunkers owned by the butan royal</v>

122
00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:59.020
<v Speaker 1>army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and they began to build a road.</v>

123
00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:02.723
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since Bhutan's protection has been in </v>

124
00:07:03.871 --> 00:07:04.560
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam,</v>

125
00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.393
<v Speaker 1>since the 19 forties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Indian troops arrived on June the 16th </v>

126
00:07:08.191 --> 00:07:12.570
<v Speaker 1>and blocked the roads construction so </v>
<v Speaker 1>far a pretty typical border conflict.</v>

127
00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.440
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the tensions,</v>

128
00:07:18.441 --> 00:07:19.274
<v Speaker 1>they didn't dilute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They actually increased as the </v>

129
00:07:21.861 --> 00:07:23.930
<v Speaker 1>discussions between Beijing and New </v>
<v Speaker 1>Delhi.</v>

130
00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:25.610
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they became quite tense.</v>

131
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.533
<v Speaker 1>Chinese state media began to threaten </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Indian government with serious </v>

132
00:07:29.091 --> 00:07:33.350
<v Speaker 1>consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and India are dangerously close to</v>

133
00:07:33.351 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>military conflict in the Himalayas out </v>
<v Speaker 1>at this point,</v>

134
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:37.910
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

135
00:07:37.911 --> 00:07:38.744
<v Speaker 1>why on earth was a land that is </v>
<v Speaker 1>practically frozen for most of the year </v>

136
00:07:40.971 --> 00:07:43.250
<v Speaker 1>given such importance?</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

137
00:07:43.251 --> 00:07:47.300
<v Speaker 1>it seems that Xi Jinping's governments </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to test India and punish them for</v>

138
00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:48.163
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bunch of things for that relationship </v>

139
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.054
<v Speaker 1>with the Dalai Lama and with Tibet for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that growing ties with Washington for </v>

140
00:07:52.551 --> 00:07:53.384
<v Speaker 1>their relations with Pakistan and so on </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so with regard to India because </v>

141
00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:57.583
<v Speaker 1>China's controlling this area with its </v>
<v Speaker 1>military presence in new road would put </v>

142
00:08:00.651 --> 00:08:01.484
<v Speaker 1>China within a stone's throw of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Siliguri corridor and narrow strip of </v>

143
00:08:04.881 --> 00:08:05.714
<v Speaker 1>land is considered strategic because it </v>
<v Speaker 1>connects seven of the states of </v>

144
00:08:08.391 --> 00:08:10.700
<v Speaker 1>northeast India with the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

145
00:08:10.730 --> 00:08:12.410
<v Speaker 1>This is something you'd see well on </v>
<v Speaker 1>this.</v>

146
00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:19.850
<v Speaker 1>It's above all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beyond the tactical issues,</v>

147
00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:23.210
<v Speaker 1>there's another important reason.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same reason why China wanted to test</v>

148
00:08:23.211 --> 00:08:25.580
<v Speaker 1>India and you're going to see what I'm </v>
<v Speaker 1>talking about in just a minute.</v>

149
00:08:28.590 --> 00:08:32.790
<v Speaker 1>Practice that finally on August the 28th</v>
<v Speaker 1>after many threats and a lot of tension,</v>

150
00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:36.750
<v Speaker 1>both sides agreed to withdraw their </v>
<v Speaker 1>troops and return to the starting points</v>

151
00:08:36.751 --> 00:08:39.660
<v Speaker 1>of this entire political muscle.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course years ago,</v>

152
00:08:39.661 --> 00:08:42.480
<v Speaker 1>both powers rivalry.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't as obvious as it is now,</v>

153
00:08:42.481 --> 00:08:44.790
<v Speaker 1>but of course let's not fool ourselves </v>
<v Speaker 1>the doc cam,</v>

154
00:08:44.970 --> 00:08:46.440
<v Speaker 1>so it's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

155
00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.393
<v Speaker 1>it's the least of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm not just saying this because of the </v>

156
00:08:48.901 --> 00:08:49.734
<v Speaker 1>more than 3000 kilometers of border that</v>
<v Speaker 1>have territorial disputes between China </v>

157
00:08:52.801 --> 00:08:57.801
<v Speaker 1>and India that are many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many more a national strategy given them</v>

158
00:09:04.291 --> 00:09:05.124
<v Speaker 1>the possible emergence of India as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superpower at the Chinese governments </v>

159
00:09:07.711 --> 00:09:11.490
<v Speaker 1>have adopted a strategy and that's just </v>
<v Speaker 1>around it and yeah,</v>

160
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:13.350
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty much exactly what it sounds </v>
<v Speaker 1>like.</v>

161
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:14.213
<v Speaker 1>In recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China has tightened its ties with </v>

162
00:09:15.751 --> 00:09:19.380
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan in exchange for $60,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars in infrastructure,</v>

163
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:24.270
<v Speaker 1>especially to connect both countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including a strategic board in China,</v>

164
00:09:24.271 --> 00:09:26.460
<v Speaker 1>will operate until at least the year 20.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fifteen,</v>

165
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:34.263
<v Speaker 1>on the other hand is a Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>government company has taken control of </v>

166
00:09:36.371 --> 00:09:37.204
<v Speaker 1>Hambantota port in Sri Lanka,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country with which Beijing is also </v>

167
00:09:40.061 --> 00:09:43.090
<v Speaker 1>strengthening its political ties </v>
<v Speaker 1>regarding Bangladesh.</v>

168
00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:45.490
<v Speaker 1>China has become the most important arm </v>
<v Speaker 1>supplier.</v>

169
00:09:45.520 --> 00:09:46.353
<v Speaker 1>Last year they sold them to submarines </v>
<v Speaker 1>and finally there's an a poll which is </v>

170
00:09:49.931 --> 00:09:50.764
<v Speaker 1>greatly improved its relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>China off to a political conflict in </v>

171
00:09:53.651 --> 00:09:55.810
<v Speaker 1>2015 with New Delhi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

172
00:09:55.811 --> 00:09:56.740
<v Speaker 1>well let's have a look at it.</v>

173
00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:03.903
<v Speaker 1>You see India is surrounded crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was simply nothing more than a move </v>

174
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:16.520
<v Speaker 1>in a chess game and this is a chess game</v>
<v Speaker 1>in which China has the economic capacity</v>

175
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.250
<v Speaker 1>under the money to make friends very </v>
<v Speaker 1>easily.</v>

176
00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:20.203
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact that China's military </v>

177
00:10:21.231 --> 00:10:24.080
<v Speaker 1>superiority over India is overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

178
00:10:24.081 --> 00:10:27.860
<v Speaker 1>that's also very helpful.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So a question that might arise after all</v>

179
00:10:27.861 --> 00:10:28.850
<v Speaker 1>of this is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

180
00:10:28.851 --> 00:10:29.684
<v Speaker 1>what's India's bet?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Or rather what's their realistic </v>

181
00:10:31.971 --> 00:10:33.460
<v Speaker 1>response as well?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That response,</v>

182
00:10:33.461 --> 00:10:34.294
<v Speaker 1>it basically comes in three words and </v>
<v Speaker 1>those three words aren't the United </v>

183
00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.073
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

184
00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:40.790
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

185
00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:41.623
<v Speaker 1>you heard it in recent years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations between the United States and </v>

186
00:10:43.521 --> 00:10:44.354
<v Speaker 1>India have become pretty close seat </v>
<v Speaker 1>between 2009 and 2016 bilateral trade </v>

187
00:10:49.011 --> 00:10:49.844
<v Speaker 1>has doubled and the sale of military </v>
<v Speaker 1>equipment from the United States to </v>

188
00:10:52.911 --> 00:10:57.660
<v Speaker 1>India has multiplied by 50 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

189
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.990
<v Speaker 1>everything indicates that India is going</v>
<v Speaker 1>to replace that old mig.</v>

190
00:11:00.991 --> 00:11:05.270
<v Speaker 1>Twenty one with a mega contracts have </v>
<v Speaker 1>newly manufactured f six teams,</v>

191
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.500
<v Speaker 1>200 of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and if this is confirmed,</v>

192
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.920
<v Speaker 1>Lockheed Martin's intention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the manufacturer with pentagons approval</v>

193
00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:13.500
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to transfer this plane's worldwide.</v>

194
00:11:13.501 --> 00:11:14.334
<v Speaker 1>Production from Texas to India are </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty unbeatable way to strengthen </v>

195
00:11:17.611 --> 00:11:18.540
<v Speaker 1>alliances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't you think?</v>

196
00:11:21.420 --> 00:11:22.253
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now we can better understand not only </v>

197
00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:27.090
<v Speaker 1>China and India's tense relationship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also for example,</v>

198
00:11:27.091 --> 00:11:29.910
<v Speaker 1>the US is new hard strategy towards </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>

199
00:11:29.911 --> 00:11:32.880
<v Speaker 1>which we discussed in our previous video</v>
<v Speaker 1>about Afghanistan</v>

200
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.220
<v Speaker 2>as of course</v>

201
00:11:40.220 --> 00:11:41.053
<v Speaker 1>all of this starts based on a premise </v>
<v Speaker 1>that India will emulate the economic </v>

202
00:11:43.791 --> 00:11:47.030
<v Speaker 1>success that China has achieved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>recent decades.</v>

203
00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:47.893
<v Speaker 1>Narendra Modi,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the popular Indian Prime Minister of </v>

204
00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:52.550
<v Speaker 1>whom we already talked about is leading </v>
<v Speaker 1>many changes,</v>

205
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:53.443
<v Speaker 1>but not as many as the country needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that is a discussion we can be for </v>

206
00:11:57.131 --> 00:11:57.964
<v Speaker 1>another day and now we want to know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think China will succeed in </v>

207
00:12:00.791 --> 00:12:01.720
<v Speaker 1>beating India?</v>
