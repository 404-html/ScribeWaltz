1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.480
<v Speaker 1>Located in the middle of the Himalayas </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Nepal is one of the most isolated,</v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:05.970
<v Speaker 1>remote and poorest countries in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.833
<v Speaker 1>Traditionally,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been a kinds of protectorates or </v>

4
00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.100
<v Speaker 1>satellites country for India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

5
00:00:11.101 --> 00:00:11.934
<v Speaker 1>at the end of 2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Communist Party of Nepal won the </v>

6
00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:15.354
<v Speaker 1>elections with an overwhelming majority </v>
<v Speaker 1>and they've now set their sights on </v>

7
00:00:18.691 --> 00:00:20.010
<v Speaker 1>Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this video,</v>

8
00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:20.903
<v Speaker 1>we're going to show you what is </v>
<v Speaker 1>happening as a bit about this country's </v>

9
00:00:22.921 --> 00:00:25.560
<v Speaker 1>greatest hidden treasure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So let's get into it.</v>

10
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.113
<v Speaker 1>Alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so I've got a question for you and </v>

11
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:38.150
<v Speaker 1>please don't Google the answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That would be cheating.</v>

12
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.830
<v Speaker 1>Do you know which country Buddha was </v>
<v Speaker 1>born in?</v>

13
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.240
<v Speaker 1>One,</v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

14
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.901
<v Speaker 1>three.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Probably.</v>

15
00:00:41.901 --> 00:00:45.230
<v Speaker 1>Guess it's Nepal,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country located in the Himalayas,</v>

16
00:00:45.231 --> 00:00:48.350
<v Speaker 1>which hosts many of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains in the world,</v>

17
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:49.213
<v Speaker 1>specifically in this country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which covers an area about the size of </v>

18
00:00:51.591 --> 00:00:52.424
<v Speaker 1>Nicaragua.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can find eight out of the 14 summits </v>

19
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.640
<v Speaker 1>in the entire world,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reach more than 8,000</v>

20
00:00:58.641 --> 00:01:00.230
<v Speaker 1>meters,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this includes,</v>

21
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.350
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mount Everest becomes very also boasts a</v>

22
00:01:09.791 --> 00:01:13.750
<v Speaker 1>total of 240 pigs that reach higher than</v>
<v Speaker 1>6,000</v>

23
00:01:13.751 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 1>meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

24
00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.670
<v Speaker 1>Nepal is a absolute paradise for people </v>
<v Speaker 1>who love mountains,</v>

25
00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.830
<v Speaker 1>and by the way Katmandu,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's capital ends,</v>

26
00:01:20.831 --> 00:01:24.450
<v Speaker 1>the largest city in the Himalayas is </v>
<v Speaker 1>also one of backpack.</v>

27
00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:27.310
<v Speaker 1>His favorite cities on the planet and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

28
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.173
<v Speaker 1>why is that?</v>

29
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:29.603
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

30
00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:33.493
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>maybe it does something to do with the </v>

31
00:01:33.801 --> 00:01:37.970
<v Speaker 1>fact that this city is full of temples,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pagodas and Ali's full of life,</v>

32
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.920
<v Speaker 1>like hobbies or were in the 21st </v>
<v Speaker 1>century.</v>

33
00:01:39.921 --> 00:01:42.350
<v Speaker 1>You won't be able to find skyscrapers </v>
<v Speaker 1>wide avenues,</v>

34
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.710
<v Speaker 1>modern buses or practically any luxury </v>
<v Speaker 1>franchise.</v>

35
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:46.793
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

36
00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:49.641
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

37
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:53.920
<v Speaker 1>Like one of those last drops of history </v>
<v Speaker 1>in a totally modern and global world.</v>

38
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.780
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as wonderful as it sounds for a visit,</v>

39
00:01:56.781 --> 00:02:00.860
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that Nepal is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>poorest countries in the world.</v>

40
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.370
<v Speaker 1>According to the United Nations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepal is one of the Asian countries with</v>

41
00:02:04.371 --> 00:02:05.204
<v Speaker 1>the worst human development index.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Scores in Nepal comes in at 144th in </v>

42
00:02:10.371 --> 00:02:12.440
<v Speaker 1>that ranking bands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'll be honest,</v>

43
00:02:12.441 --> 00:02:17.441
<v Speaker 1>this isn't really surprising.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

44
00:02:18.331 --> 00:02:20.970
<v Speaker 1>despite having almost 30 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants,</v>

45
00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:21.804
<v Speaker 1>it's economy is smaller than that of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia whose population belly exceeds </v>

46
00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.770
<v Speaker 1>10 million people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means that in per capita terms,</v>

47
00:02:28.771 --> 00:02:32.160
<v Speaker 1>Bolivia is three times richer than </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepal.</v>

48
00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.640
<v Speaker 1>That's why with everyday that passes </v>
<v Speaker 1>1,500</v>

49
00:02:39.641 --> 00:02:42.190
<v Speaker 1>people move abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>1,500</v>

50
00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:43.230
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if you are,</v>

51
00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.370
<v Speaker 1>this has not made it easy for the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepalese.</v>

52
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:46.810
<v Speaker 1>Do you want to know why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

53
00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:51.811
<v Speaker 1>listen up dominated country.</v>

54
00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:57.660
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

55
00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.373
<v Speaker 1>The political system has been anchored </v>
<v Speaker 1>in the past until practically the day </v>

56
00:03:03.771 --> 00:03:08.771
<v Speaker 1>before yesterday in 2008.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepal was an absolute monarchy under the</v>

57
00:03:08.931 --> 00:03:11.570
<v Speaker 1>exclusive control of the king and by the</v>
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>

58
00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:12.404
<v Speaker 1>fun little tidbit of knowledge right now</v>
<v Speaker 1>despite being the birth place of butter </v>

59
00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.610
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>until 2006,</v>

60
00:03:16.611 --> 00:03:18.670
<v Speaker 1>this was the only country in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>were hidden.</v>

61
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.543
<v Speaker 1>Do Islam was the official religion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also leave that between 1996 and </v>

62
00:03:23.541 --> 00:03:26.030
<v Speaker 1>2006.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The country suffered through a civil war</v>

63
00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:28.220
<v Speaker 1>between governments or forces,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the monarchy,</v>

64
00:03:28.221 --> 00:03:29.054
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship forces and the Maoist </v>
<v Speaker 1>rebels who supported the establishment </v>

65
00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.530
<v Speaker 1>of a communist republic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

66
00:03:36.531 --> 00:03:38.330
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Monarchy,</v>

67
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.350
<v Speaker 1>civil war Maoism probably can understand</v>
<v Speaker 1>now why this country is quite so poor.</v>

68
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:47.380
<v Speaker 1>There has been such a huge amounts of </v>
<v Speaker 1>chaos in the last 30 years,</v>

69
00:03:47.381 --> 00:03:52.381
<v Speaker 1>but the average life expectancy of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>government was wait for it one year.</v>

70
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:00.020
<v Speaker 1>You have you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is certainly not everything.</v>

71
00:04:00.021 --> 00:04:03.230
<v Speaker 1>Nepal has another characteristic that is</v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly conditioned.</v>

72
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:07.140
<v Speaker 1>It's political and economic situation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See as you probably known,</v>

73
00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:07.983
<v Speaker 1>Nepal has no coast and have you noticed </v>
<v Speaker 1>too all that only neighbors exactly in </v>

74
00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.263
<v Speaker 1>Nepal is stuck between two giants </v>
<v Speaker 1>between the two most probable future </v>

75
00:04:19.261 --> 00:04:21.570
<v Speaker 1>great powers of this century.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

76
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.510
<v Speaker 1>that's India and that's China to </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries that Maura,</v>

77
00:04:24.511 --> 00:04:25.344
<v Speaker 1>that don't exactly get on very well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>we have seen previously on visual </v>

78
00:04:29.341 --> 00:04:30.174
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>

79
00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:32.733
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could say that both China and India </v>

80
00:04:34.361 --> 00:04:38.410
<v Speaker 1>are in the forefront of Nepal's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ministry of Foreign Affairs mind.</v>

81
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.060
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that traditionally,</v>

82
00:04:40.061 --> 00:04:40.894
<v Speaker 1>and largely thanks to the geography that</v>
<v Speaker 1>favors at Nepal has been kind of a </v>

83
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:44.673
<v Speaker 1>satellite country for India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something the New Delhi government has </v>

84
00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.770
<v Speaker 1>always been very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very clear about</v>

85
00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:52.043
<v Speaker 3>wants to micromanage Nepal.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to control all government </v>

86
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:55.600
<v Speaker 3>appointments.</v>
<v Speaker 3>They have to know everything.</v>

87
00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.610
<v Speaker 3>They're ambassadors behave like </v>
<v Speaker 3>viceroys,</v>

88
00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:58.900
<v Speaker 3>aren't we?</v>
<v Speaker 3>A sovereign nation,</v>

89
00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:03.100
<v Speaker 3>Kishore Shrestha,</v>
<v Speaker 3>editor of Jonah Asta National Weekly and</v>

90
00:05:03.101 --> 00:05:05.200
<v Speaker 3>a board member of Nepal's press council.</v>

91
00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.083
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps the best proof of how India has </v>
<v Speaker 1>always wanted to control this remote </v>

92
00:05:08.671 --> 00:05:11.640
<v Speaker 1>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Destiny happens in 2015,</v>

93
00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:21.233
<v Speaker 1>but that's the only political forces </v>
<v Speaker 1>were designing the constitution of the </v>

94
00:05:23.831 --> 00:05:27.100
<v Speaker 1>newly created Democratic Federal </v>
<v Speaker 1>Republic of the poll.</v>

95
00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:27.963
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>New Delhi demanded that Nepal create a </v>

96
00:05:29.201 --> 00:05:30.034
<v Speaker 1>separate province for people of Indian </v>
<v Speaker 1>descent who were living in the terrain </v>

97
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.930
<v Speaker 1>planes say region in southern Nepal on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the border with.</v>

98
00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.913
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

99
00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:44.630
<v Speaker 1>This was something that the Nepalese </v>
<v Speaker 1>political forces emphatically opposed.</v>

100
00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:45.493
<v Speaker 1>They wouldn't established political </v>
<v Speaker 1>separations based on identity under any </v>

101
00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.720
<v Speaker 1>circumstances.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

102
00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.150
<v Speaker 1>when New Delhi didn't get an affirmative</v>
<v Speaker 1>answer,</v>

103
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.010
<v Speaker 1>what do you think they did?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

104
00:05:55.011 --> 00:05:58.820
<v Speaker 1>they blocked the borders.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now it was all but provision trucks,</v>

105
00:05:58.821 --> 00:06:00.230
<v Speaker 1>they just stopped crossing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

106
00:06:00.231 --> 00:06:01.550
<v Speaker 1>this would have been bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really,</v>

107
00:06:01.551 --> 00:06:04.460
<v Speaker 1>really bad under any circumstances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but on top of all of that,</v>

108
00:06:04.461 --> 00:06:07.310
<v Speaker 1>this blockade happens when the country </v>
<v Speaker 1>was at its worst,</v>

109
00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:08.173
<v Speaker 1>it adjusts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>suffered a huge wake quake that caused </v>

110
00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:14.540
<v Speaker 1>enormous damage.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The deadly's seven point eight magnitude</v>

111
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:19.310
<v Speaker 1>earthquake struck Nepal in 2015 and </v>
<v Speaker 1>killed thousands of people so powerful.</v>

112
00:06:19.311 --> 00:06:20.144
<v Speaker 1>It moved Mount Everest is he not want.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This hasn't been the only blockade or </v>

113
00:06:23.841 --> 00:06:24.674
<v Speaker 1>the only strategy that India is used to </v>
<v Speaker 1>pressure the Nepalese politicians to </v>

114
00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:29.203
<v Speaker 1>follow their advice offer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All trade with India has traditionally </v>

115
00:06:32.571 --> 00:06:36.470
<v Speaker 1>accounted for almost three quarters of </v>
<v Speaker 1>all Napoli's trade,</v>

116
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.120
<v Speaker 1>the now after centuries of absolute </v>
<v Speaker 1>monarchy and decades of war and chaos.</v>

117
00:06:46.121 --> 00:06:46.954
<v Speaker 1>Things are finally beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>normalize in the polk and democracy is </v>

118
00:06:50.051 --> 00:06:50.884
<v Speaker 1>gaining strength and also China's doors </v>
<v Speaker 1>that are getting to open China's </v>

119
00:07:00.881 --> 00:07:01.714
<v Speaker 1>arrival.</v>

120
00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:02.893
<v Speaker 2>Okay?</v>

121
00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:08.700
<v Speaker 1>China and Nepal share a 1,400</v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometer border and in recent years,</v>

122
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:11.430
<v Speaker 1>this border,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's become quite fashionable.</v>

123
00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:12.323
<v Speaker 1>Commercial relations between both </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries have tripled since 2010 China </v>

124
00:07:15.961 --> 00:07:17.070
<v Speaker 1>results.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It becomes the country.</v>

125
00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:17.963
<v Speaker 1>This invests the most money every year </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Nepal and tourism coming from the </v>

126
00:07:21.391 --> 00:07:25.980
<v Speaker 1>great Asian power is growing rapidly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last 10 years alone,</v>

127
00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:26.814
<v Speaker 1>despite the earthquake,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of Chinese tourists arriving </v>

128
00:07:28.771 --> 00:07:31.690
<v Speaker 1>into poll every year has multiplied by </v>
<v Speaker 1>four</v>

129
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.870
<v Speaker 1>present trying to depaul relations are </v>
<v Speaker 1>developing at the fastest pace.</v>

130
00:07:35.871 --> 00:07:38.960
<v Speaker 1>We've seen you home Chinese ambassador </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Nepal.</v>

131
00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:42.560
<v Speaker 1>That's how relations between Nepal and </v>
<v Speaker 1>China are growing.</v>

132
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.333
<v Speaker 1>Hydro power to cement Chinese businesses</v>
<v Speaker 1>are already all around this small South </v>

133
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:48.823
<v Speaker 1>Asian country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese Internet providers are breaking </v>

134
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:52.940
<v Speaker 1>Indian monopoly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese tourists are flooding Nepal.</v>

135
00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.833
<v Speaker 1>Chinese language institutions are </v>
<v Speaker 1>mushrooming more Nepali students are </v>

136
00:07:56.181 --> 00:07:57.014
<v Speaker 1>traveling to China and to India and </v>
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of Nepali officers are invited </v>

137
00:08:00.381 --> 00:08:05.381
<v Speaker 1>to China every year as part of an </v>
<v Speaker 1>unprecedented charm offensive that's not</v>

138
00:08:05.621 --> 00:08:06.454
<v Speaker 1>all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of 2017 elections were held </v>

139
00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:11.270
<v Speaker 1>to elect a new parliaments and two brand</v>
<v Speaker 1>new government.</v>

140
00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:19.823
<v Speaker 1>The communist party's victory was </v>
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming and this is a communist </v>

141
00:08:22.531 --> 00:08:25.560
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Very much influenced by Beijing.</v>

142
00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.453
<v Speaker 1>Now the new prime minister Cardigan </v>
<v Speaker 1>really has boosted relations with its </v>

143
00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:31.530
<v Speaker 1>northern neighbor to grow trade and </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

144
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.393
<v Speaker 1>but also to gain independence from India</v>
<v Speaker 1>because it's number one priority and </v>

145
00:08:36.061 --> 00:08:36.894
<v Speaker 1>folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beijing clearly doesn't want to miss </v>

146
00:08:38.671 --> 00:08:39.990
<v Speaker 1>this opportunity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

147
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.853
<v Speaker 1>Beijing is putting huge projects on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>table to change the whole situation </v>

148
00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:45.390
<v Speaker 1>forever.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roads,</v>

149
00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:46.890
<v Speaker 1>airports,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the bubble,</v>

150
00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:48.800
<v Speaker 1>the promise of a new railway line.</v>

151
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:54.690
<v Speaker 2>Appreciate because sign up with a other </v>
<v Speaker 2>fields.</v>

152
00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:07.493
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government has announced </v>

153
00:09:08.581 --> 00:09:09.414
<v Speaker 1>that is looking into extending the </v>
<v Speaker 1>railway that connects to best with the </v>

154
00:09:11.761 --> 00:09:12.594
<v Speaker 1>eastern coast all the way to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepalese border and there is little </v>

155
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:16.194
<v Speaker 1>doubt that China would have no problem </v>
<v Speaker 1>financing the railways construction all </v>

156
00:09:19.651 --> 00:09:21.480
<v Speaker 1>the way to cat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Man Do.</v>

157
00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:23.340
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

158
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:24.173
<v Speaker 1>By the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we already know talking about a small </v>

159
00:09:25.591 --> 00:09:27.420
<v Speaker 1>project APP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting Napoleon.</v>

160
00:09:27.421 --> 00:09:31.680
<v Speaker 1>China by rail could mean multiplying the</v>
<v Speaker 1>arrival of Chinese tourists by 10,</v>

161
00:09:31.681 --> 00:09:32.514
<v Speaker 1>15 or even 20 times.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if the train in addition was </v>

162
00:09:35.641 --> 00:09:36.474
<v Speaker 1>connected to the Indian railway network,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we could be speaking of a revolution in </v>

163
00:09:39.841 --> 00:09:42.450
<v Speaker 1>transporting merchandise between the </v>
<v Speaker 1>two.</v>

164
00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:47.480
<v Speaker 1>Great giant.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If we can connect this railway network,</v>

165
00:09:48.890 --> 00:09:49.723
<v Speaker 1>our east West Rail project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it can revolutionize trying to India </v>

166
00:09:52.271 --> 00:09:55.000
<v Speaker 1>trade with Nepal in the Middle Cod,</v>
<v Speaker 1>God prawsaud,</v>

167
00:09:55.510 --> 00:09:56.343
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister of Nepal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course the new government doesn't </v>

168
00:09:58.211 --> 00:09:59.044
<v Speaker 1>intend to break ties with India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it looks like Nepal has stopped </v>

169
00:10:01.391 --> 00:10:02.224
<v Speaker 1>being New Delhi subordinates and most </v>
<v Speaker 1>importantly for the first time it looks </v>

170
00:10:05.381 --> 00:10:08.980
<v Speaker 1>like this country has a clear option for</v>
<v Speaker 1>a better future.</v>

171
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:14.070
<v Speaker 1>You want to know our well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up future water and mountains.</v>

172
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:22.620
<v Speaker 1>Nepal is one of the poorest countries in</v>
<v Speaker 1>the world,</v>

173
00:10:22.621 --> 00:10:25.140
<v Speaker 1>but it doesn't have to continue to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>so.</v>

174
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:26.093
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand in Nepal is a country </v>

175
00:10:27.661 --> 00:10:28.800
<v Speaker 1>with nature,</v>
<v Speaker 1>mountains,</v>

176
00:10:28.801 --> 00:10:31.380
<v Speaker 1>exotic landscapes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and an impressive gastronomy.</v>

177
00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.273
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's no secret that it's tourism </v>

178
00:10:33.181 --> 00:10:34.014
<v Speaker 1>potential is absolutely huge,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if communications with China </v>

179
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.320
<v Speaker 1>improve and just we've seen that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty damn likely to happen.</v>

180
00:10:40.380 --> 00:10:42.570
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who would not like to visit Nepal?</v>

181
00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.690
<v Speaker 1>It's not all in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>far from it.</v>

182
00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:55.750
<v Speaker 1>The Paul's great hidden treasure is </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually water.</v>

183
00:11:04.180 --> 00:11:04.560
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

184
00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:08.100
<v Speaker 1>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's really water as we've already seen.</v>

185
00:11:08.190 --> 00:11:09.023
<v Speaker 1>The pool has huge mountains and steep </v>
<v Speaker 1>valleys that have been carved by large </v>

186
00:11:12.571 --> 00:11:15.450
<v Speaker 1>rivets and what can be done with all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>this natural wealth.</v>

187
00:11:15.480 --> 00:11:16.313
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Studies conducted by the Nepalese </v>

188
00:11:19.151 --> 00:11:19.984
<v Speaker 1>government and show them the pools of </v>
<v Speaker 1>underwater resources can produce huge </v>

189
00:11:23.081 --> 00:11:26.320
<v Speaker 1>amounts of hydroelectric power at a very</v>
<v Speaker 1>low cost.</v>

190
00:11:26.350 --> 00:11:27.183
<v Speaker 1>Basically it's potential power </v>
<v Speaker 1>generation capacity could be almost 50 </v>

191
00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:30.484
<v Speaker 1>percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>half of all the hydro power that is </v>

192
00:11:32.441 --> 00:11:34.540
<v Speaker 1>produced within the United States,</v>

193
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:37.740
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

194
00:11:37.740 --> 00:11:40.750
<v Speaker 1>that is a lot of electricity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

195
00:11:40.770 --> 00:11:43.810
<v Speaker 1>let's not forget,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nepal is located between India and China</v>

196
00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.773
<v Speaker 1>and very close to Bangladesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These all three fast growing economies </v>

197
00:11:48.221 --> 00:11:53.221
<v Speaker 1>whose electricity consumption is </v>
<v Speaker 1>absolutely soaring and the pool,</v>

198
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:55.233
<v Speaker 1>while that may have the capacity to </v>
<v Speaker 1>supply them with the cheapest </v>

199
00:11:57.700 --> 00:11:59.200
<v Speaker 1>electricity of all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

200
00:11:59.201 --> 00:12:01.960
<v Speaker 1>of course so far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>none of this has been exploited,</v>

201
00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:02.823
<v Speaker 1>but everything indicates that this </v>
<v Speaker 1>abandonments can be left behind very </v>

202
00:12:06.221 --> 00:12:08.230
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If the country regain stability,</v>

203
00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.490
<v Speaker 1>investors will line up to finance and </v>
<v Speaker 1>develop this kind of project.</v>

204
00:12:13.270 --> 00:12:15.670
<v Speaker 1>The only resource we have,</v>
<v Speaker 1>like the Arabian countries,</v>

205
00:12:15.671 --> 00:12:19.540
<v Speaker 1>have oil is water chubby guy or project </v>
<v Speaker 1>manager at the rush of what God.</v>

206
00:12:19.541 --> 00:12:20.374
<v Speaker 1>The hydroelectric project,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a 111 megawatt plant under construction </v>

207
00:12:24.011 --> 00:12:27.040
<v Speaker 1>near China's border and the potential it</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't end there.</v>

208
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:27.933
<v Speaker 1>Nepal's new closeness to China could </v>
<v Speaker 1>make Chinese money Russians to the </v>

209
00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:34.210
<v Speaker 1>country in order to finance large </v>
<v Speaker 1>hydroelectric plants.</v>

210
00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.073
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's precisely what the Nepalese </v>

211
00:12:36.161 --> 00:12:36.994
<v Speaker 1>government is thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Depaul's new communist prime minister </v>

212
00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:41.223
<v Speaker 1>will restart a Chinese led two point $5,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion US dollar hydropower project </v>

213
00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.590
<v Speaker 1>that was pulled by the previous </v>
<v Speaker 1>government,</v>

214
00:12:47.591 --> 00:12:49.660
<v Speaker 1>considered friendly towards India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

215
00:12:49.661 --> 00:12:52.630
<v Speaker 1>the situation now is that the pool is </v>
<v Speaker 1>still a very poor country,</v>

216
00:12:52.660 --> 00:12:55.840
<v Speaker 1>but with new policies it could stop </v>
<v Speaker 1>being so.</v>

217
00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:56.733
<v Speaker 1>So will the new government,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the able to leave its ideological </v>

218
00:12:59.051 --> 00:13:01.270
<v Speaker 1>inclinations behind and bet on </v>
<v Speaker 1>stability,</v>

219
00:13:01.330 --> 00:13:03.340
<v Speaker 1>openness and foreign investments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

220
00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.530
<v Speaker 1>only time will tell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

221
00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.433
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that Nepal should bet on </v>
<v Speaker 1>China or should it continue to </v>

222
00:13:09.221 --> 00:13:11.170
<v Speaker 1>strengthen ties with India?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

<v Speaker 1>leave your answer in the comments below </v>
