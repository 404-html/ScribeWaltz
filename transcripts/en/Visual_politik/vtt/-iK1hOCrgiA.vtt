1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.330
<v Speaker 1>History has shown us that sometimes the </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible happens.</v>

2
00:00:03.331 --> 00:00:06.900
<v Speaker 1>Mikhail Gorbachev went from leading of a</v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union,</v>

3
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:18.310
<v Speaker 1>the face as a North American </v>
<v Speaker 1>multinational company.</v>

4
00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.490
<v Speaker 2>Sometimes nothing brings people </v>
<v Speaker 2>together.</v>

5
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.083
<v Speaker 2>Pizza,</v>

6
00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.250
<v Speaker 1>so will we ever see something like this </v>
<v Speaker 1>in North Korea?</v>

7
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.540
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up.</v>

8
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.120
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor country.</v>

9
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.983
<v Speaker 1>The available estimates state that their</v>
<v Speaker 1>per capita production value is 50 times </v>

10
00:00:53.811 --> 00:00:58.010
<v Speaker 1>smaller than that of South Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Less than 1000 kilometers of their roads</v>

11
00:00:58.011 --> 00:00:58.844
<v Speaker 1>are paved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The average life expectancy is the </v>

12
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>lowest in the entire region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and despite having received humanitarian</v>

13
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:08.810
<v Speaker 1>aid for more than 22 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's still poverty all over.</v>

14
00:01:08.811 --> 00:01:09.644
<v Speaker 1>The country</v>

15
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.740
<v Speaker 1>is not even the west of it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The worst is a total lack of respect for</v>

16
00:01:19.741 --> 00:01:20.574
<v Speaker 1>human rights.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The North Koreans live under an iron </v>

17
00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:23.670
<v Speaker 1>pans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship,</v>

18
00:01:23.671 --> 00:01:24.504
<v Speaker 1>and the police state where political </v>
<v Speaker 1>prisoners amounts to tens and tens of </v>

19
00:01:27.901 --> 00:01:29.040
<v Speaker 1>thousands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

20
00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.933
<v Speaker 1>according to the United Nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there could be between 80 and a hundred </v>

21
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.030
<v Speaker 1>and 20,000 political prisoners in </v>
<v Speaker 1>reeducation camps in North Korea.</v>

22
00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.353
<v Speaker 1>The state controls everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on just a moment because in </v>

23
00:01:43.111 --> 00:01:47.640
<v Speaker 1>recent years and important change seems </v>
<v Speaker 1>to have occurred in the country a change</v>

24
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.520
<v Speaker 1>that has a lot to do with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with commerce into,</v>

25
00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:53.400
<v Speaker 1>with the market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see theoretically North Korea as the</v>

26
00:01:53.401 --> 00:01:54.234
<v Speaker 1>last large country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the last launch state with a communist </v>

27
00:01:56.821 --> 00:01:59.880
<v Speaker 1>ideology here practically everything is </v>
<v Speaker 1>directed,</v>

28
00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.440
<v Speaker 1>organized,</v>
<v Speaker 1>manufactured,</v>

29
00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.350
<v Speaker 1>and provided for by the state,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including housing,</v>

30
00:02:04.351 --> 00:02:05.280
<v Speaker 1>health,</v>
<v Speaker 1>education,</v>

31
00:02:05.281 --> 00:02:06.420
<v Speaker 1>food,</v>
<v Speaker 1>employments,</v>

32
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:06.910
<v Speaker 1>access.</v>

33
00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.743
<v Speaker 2>True.</v>

34
00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.320
<v Speaker 1>This is all in theory and the truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is very different.</v>

35
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.213
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the states has a great deal of </v>

36
00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:17.980
<v Speaker 1>limitations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Basically,</v>

37
00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.830
<v Speaker 1>it's becoming less and less able to do </v>
<v Speaker 1>stuff.</v>

38
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:22.540
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of the states,</v>

39
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:23.374
<v Speaker 1>factories and farms productivity levels </v>
<v Speaker 1>are absolutely on the floor and </v>

40
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.360
<v Speaker 1>additionally in many cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as a result of very old machinery,</v>

41
00:02:32.361 --> 00:02:35.000
<v Speaker 1>backwoods production methods,</v>
<v Speaker 1>international sanctions,</v>

42
00:02:35.001 --> 00:02:38.450
<v Speaker 1>and even electrical supply problems for </v>
<v Speaker 1>a great part of their time.</v>

43
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:40.210
<v Speaker 1>Production centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they aren't even open.</v>

44
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:43.250
<v Speaker 2>Did all</v>

45
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.083
<v Speaker 1>of this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A new private economy has gained </v>

46
00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:46.603
<v Speaker 1>strength in recent years from which more</v>
<v Speaker 1>and more North Koreans now depends in </v>

47
00:02:49.911 --> 00:02:52.700
<v Speaker 1>order to survive and improve their </v>
<v Speaker 1>living standards.</v>

48
00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:53.990
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on just a second,</v>

49
00:02:53.991 --> 00:02:58.010
<v Speaker 1>because a private sector in North Korea </v>
<v Speaker 1>with markets and with capitalism,</v>

50
00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.903
<v Speaker 1>it sounds pretty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you absolutely have to write and </v>

51
00:03:01.361 --> 00:03:02.200
<v Speaker 1>listen to this</v>

52
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.850
<v Speaker 3>new North Korean market.</v>

53
00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:10.723
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

54
00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.353
<v Speaker 1>dvr.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Kim Jon was officially declared </v>

55
00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:15.933
<v Speaker 1>supreme leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is the absolute dictator of North </v>

56
00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.680
<v Speaker 1>Korea on December the 28th,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2011,</v>

57
00:03:20.681 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>many analysts thought that things could </v>
<v Speaker 1>change in the country.</v>

58
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.323
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a generational change that was </v>

59
00:03:28.821 --> 00:03:32.930
<v Speaker 1>bringing a 28 year olds in the power </v>
<v Speaker 1>that 28 year olds who had studied abroad</v>

60
00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:34.110
<v Speaker 1>in Switzerland.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

61
00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:37.280
<v Speaker 1>it became clear that some things weren't</v>
<v Speaker 1>going to change.</v>

62
00:03:37.281 --> 00:03:41.040
<v Speaker 1>North Korea's new leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong UN has turned out to be just as</v>

63
00:03:41.041 --> 00:03:43.270
<v Speaker 1>terrible as his father was.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The purges,</v>

64
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.220
<v Speaker 1>the inhuman punishments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the rampant persecution,</v>

65
00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:48.200
<v Speaker 1>the leader centered Coulson's.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In short,</v>

66
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.053
<v Speaker 1>you complete control of citizens' lives </v>
<v Speaker 1>have continued to being this regimes </v>

67
00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:54.290
<v Speaker 1>main characteristics,</v>

68
00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:58.730
<v Speaker 3>religion from birth.</v>
<v Speaker 3>You've learned about the Kim family,</v>

69
00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.623
<v Speaker 3>learned that they are gods,</v>
<v Speaker 3>that you must be absolutely obedient to </v>

70
00:04:03.231 --> 00:04:04.064
<v Speaker 3>the Kim family.</v>
<v Speaker 3>The elites are treated nicely and </v>

71
00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:09.440
<v Speaker 3>because of that they make sure that the </v>
<v Speaker 3>system stays stable,</v>

72
00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.630
<v Speaker 3>but for everyone else it's a reign of </v>
<v Speaker 3>terror.</v>

73
00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.950
<v Speaker 3>A doctor who worked at a hospital in </v>
<v Speaker 3>North Korea and now works as a doctor at</v>

74
00:04:15.951 --> 00:04:17.300
<v Speaker 3>a hospital in South Korea,</v>

75
00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:19.940
<v Speaker 1>however they have you a sentence can.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Johnathan came to power.</v>

76
00:04:19.941 --> 00:04:20.774
<v Speaker 1>Something surprising has happened,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dozens of markets when North Koreans </v>

77
00:04:23.631 --> 00:04:26.210
<v Speaker 1>trade privately have opened throughout </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>

78
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.290
<v Speaker 1>a new class of merchants and </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurs is growing in North Korea.</v>

79
00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:34.413
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>according to the Career Institute for </v>

80
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:40.150
<v Speaker 1>National Unification around 1 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>people working directly in these markets</v>

81
00:04:40.151 --> 00:04:43.180
<v Speaker 1>which have already become one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>main sources of wealth in the country.</v>

82
00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:48.190
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you want me to run during right now,</v>

83
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.880
<v Speaker 1>but Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second.</v>

84
00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.070
<v Speaker 1>How did those markets kind of out?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

85
00:04:52.071 --> 00:04:52.904
<v Speaker 1>let me tell you first that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 1>have the most glamorous or happiest of </v>

86
00:04:56.751 --> 00:05:01.460
<v Speaker 1>beginnings.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see,</v>

87
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:06.140
<v Speaker 1>it all started in the 19 nineties when </v>
<v Speaker 1>famine caused by government mistakes,</v>

88
00:05:06.141 --> 00:05:07.880
<v Speaker 1>lack of resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>weather conditions,</v>

89
00:05:07.881 --> 00:05:11.420
<v Speaker 1>and the collapse of the Soviet Union </v>
<v Speaker 1>reeks absolute havoc.</v>

90
00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.483
<v Speaker 2>Tree</v>

91
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.970
<v Speaker 1>midstate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the between one to 2 million people died</v>

92
00:05:18.971 --> 00:05:19.804
<v Speaker 1>of starvation right at the time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Koreans were struggling to </v>

93
00:05:22.421 --> 00:05:24.040
<v Speaker 1>survive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The first markets arose,</v>

94
00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.033
<v Speaker 1>places where people could exchange </v>
<v Speaker 1>anything they could to get resources </v>

95
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.980
<v Speaker 1>with which they could buy food,</v>

96
00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:33.120
<v Speaker 3>realize that if we did nothing,</v>
<v Speaker 3>we would die of hunger.</v>

97
00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.340
<v Speaker 3>So we started to trade Ju Yung</v>

98
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:36.323
<v Speaker 1>suddenly dozens and dozens of markets </v>
<v Speaker 1>appeared throughout the country saving </v>

99
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.463
<v Speaker 1>thousands and thousands of lives.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's precisely why the regime didn't </v>

100
00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:45.390
<v Speaker 1>persecute to this type of private </v>
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>

101
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:49.160
<v Speaker 1>as you might expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kim Jong,</v>

102
00:05:49.161 --> 00:05:50.430
<v Speaker 1>Il,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the current leaders.</v>

103
00:05:50.431 --> 00:05:51.264
<v Speaker 1>Father,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's just say that sometimes he </v>

104
00:05:52.441 --> 00:05:55.830
<v Speaker 1>tolerated these markets and sometimes he</v>
<v Speaker 1>decided to repress them.</v>

105
00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.710
<v Speaker 1>But since Kim Jong Uhm,</v>
<v Speaker 1>came to power,</v>

106
00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:00.573
<v Speaker 1>the number of private markets is </v>
<v Speaker 1>multiplied and satellite images show </v>

107
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:04.334
<v Speaker 1>that they don't stop growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now the government government's </v>

108
00:06:06.021 --> 00:06:06.854
<v Speaker 1>authorized as many of these markets and </v>
<v Speaker 1>exchange for renting out spaces to the </v>

109
00:06:09.681 --> 00:06:10.514
<v Speaker 1>nutshell.</v>

110
00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.570
<v Speaker 2>Yep,</v>

111
00:06:13.570 --> 00:06:14.403
<v Speaker 1>that's right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Pyongyang government is taking </v>

112
00:06:15.791 --> 00:06:19.010
<v Speaker 1>advantage of this new private economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but well,</v>

113
00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:20.050
<v Speaker 1>how much?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

114
00:06:20.051 --> 00:06:23.200
<v Speaker 1>according to the Career Institute for </v>
<v Speaker 1>National Unification is calculations.</v>

115
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.310
<v Speaker 1>They get more than 220,000 American </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars per day,</v>

116
00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.173
<v Speaker 1>so precisely for this reason recently </v>
<v Speaker 1>the government isn't only promoting </v>

117
00:06:31.211 --> 00:06:32.044
<v Speaker 1>these markets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also granting visas to many </v>

118
00:06:33.731 --> 00:06:34.564
<v Speaker 1>Chinese entrepreneurs and traders to </v>
<v Speaker 1>further stimulate this economic </v>

119
00:06:37.841 --> 00:06:38.674
<v Speaker 1>activity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but to you it does not end that because </v>

120
00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:42.003
<v Speaker 1>while listening to this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's only the activity of regulated </v>

121
00:06:56.731 --> 00:06:59.970
<v Speaker 1>markets that's growing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's also of the unofficial markets.</v>

122
00:06:59.971 --> 00:07:03.300
<v Speaker 1>That is those that don't have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>authorities official approval,</v>

123
00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:04.163
<v Speaker 1>the black market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Seeing this all works in the following </v>

124
00:07:07.531 --> 00:07:08.364
<v Speaker 1>way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in an economic parallel to the public </v>

125
00:07:09.691 --> 00:07:11.310
<v Speaker 1>sector.</v>
<v Speaker 1>People can make everything.</v>

126
00:07:11.311 --> 00:07:14.730
<v Speaker 1>They can choose sweets,</v>
<v Speaker 1>clothes and naturally they tried to sell</v>

127
00:07:14.731 --> 00:07:17.820
<v Speaker 1>these products in the market and to get </v>
<v Speaker 1>money and the currencies,</v>

128
00:07:17.821 --> 00:07:21.420
<v Speaker 1>they're hoping for probably 10 or even </v>
<v Speaker 1>American dollars,</v>

129
00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:23.943
<v Speaker 1>but even so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's estimated that 80 percent of the </v>

130
00:07:25.301 --> 00:07:28.330
<v Speaker 1>product sold in North Korean markets </v>
<v Speaker 1>come from China.</v>

131
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:29.650
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>illegal trade,</v>

132
00:07:29.651 --> 00:07:32.680
<v Speaker 1>which happens behind the government's </v>
<v Speaker 1>back also crosses the border.</v>

133
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:36.610
<v Speaker 1>It's crossing the border in huge and </v>
<v Speaker 1>ever growing volume.</v>

134
00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:42.823
<v Speaker 1>Many of these unofficial markets are </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming a window to the outside world </v>

135
00:07:45.841 --> 00:07:49.020
<v Speaker 1>for many North Koreans because Dvo in </v>
<v Speaker 1>these places,</v>

136
00:07:49.021 --> 00:07:49.854
<v Speaker 1>you can even buy a usb stick full of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign movies and shows including </v>

137
00:07:53.370 --> 00:07:56.550
<v Speaker 1>Hollywood productions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We saw four and programming.</v>

138
00:07:56.551 --> 00:07:57.384
<v Speaker 1>We had to close all the doors and </v>
<v Speaker 1>curtains and pretend that there was </v>

139
00:07:59.731 --> 00:08:02.850
<v Speaker 1>nobody home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Dan became so you might be wondering,</v>

140
00:08:02.851 --> 00:08:04.740
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>contraband crossing borders,</v>

141
00:08:04.741 --> 00:08:08.010
<v Speaker 1>why aren't gods in the security services</v>
<v Speaker 1>doing something about this?</v>

142
00:08:08.011 --> 00:08:10.620
<v Speaker 1>Why are they tolerating this illegal </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade?</v>

143
00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.640
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>basically for two reasons,</v>

144
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:14.213
<v Speaker 2>the</v>

145
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.583
<v Speaker 1>is that in Pyongyang there doesn't seem </v>
<v Speaker 1>to be much pressure to combat these </v>

146
00:08:19.531 --> 00:08:23.160
<v Speaker 1>markets and we're going to see wine and </v>
<v Speaker 1>moments and seconds because the soldiers</v>

147
00:08:23.161 --> 00:08:23.994
<v Speaker 1>and border guards are also a part of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>business and sometimes even lends a </v>

148
00:08:27.501 --> 00:08:32.501
<v Speaker 1>hand.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's right.</v>

149
00:08:32.660 --> 00:08:36.020
<v Speaker 1>A common method of payments according to</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of the traders who now live outside</v>

150
00:08:36.021 --> 00:08:36.854
<v Speaker 1>of North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is to deliver packs of cigarettes </v>

151
00:08:38.211 --> 00:08:40.430
<v Speaker 1>stuffed with money to the police and </v>
<v Speaker 1>soldiers.</v>

152
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.183
<v Speaker 1>While the fact is that these </v>
<v Speaker 1>international merchants byproducts in </v>

153
00:08:45.561 --> 00:08:46.394
<v Speaker 1>the North Korean authorized markets or </v>
<v Speaker 1>the black market and then transfer them </v>

154
00:08:49.161 --> 00:08:49.994
<v Speaker 1>to try and sell them and with that money</v>
<v Speaker 1>they buy Chinese products and take them </v>

155
00:08:52.881 --> 00:08:56.010
<v Speaker 1>back to North Korea to sell.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's the process as oldest</v>

156
00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.193
<v Speaker 2>self</v>

157
00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:04.500
<v Speaker 1>and here within this world of </v>
<v Speaker 1>international trade is where a new class</v>

158
00:09:04.530 --> 00:09:05.363
<v Speaker 1>is emerging.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Individuals who usually have power or </v>

159
00:09:07.351 --> 00:09:08.184
<v Speaker 1>influence or dealings with high </v>
<v Speaker 1>officials who were making serious money </v>

160
00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:11.933
<v Speaker 1>and by the way that driving a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>activities that have nothing to do with </v>

161
00:09:15.001 --> 00:09:18.510
<v Speaker 1>the old socialist model within Pyongyang</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

162
00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:23.100
<v Speaker 1>The salary for doctors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it was about 3,501 a month.</v>

163
00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 1>That was less than a cost by one </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilogram of rice.</v>

164
00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.830
<v Speaker 1>So of course being a doctor was not my </v>
<v Speaker 1>main job.</v>

165
00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:29.873
<v Speaker 1>My main job was smuggling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At night I would send herbal medicine </v>

166
00:09:32.761 --> 00:09:33.594
<v Speaker 1>from North Korea into China with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>money I would import home appliances </v>

167
00:09:36.571 --> 00:09:38.640
<v Speaker 1>back into North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rice cookers,</v>

168
00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:40.830
<v Speaker 1>no tells,</v>
<v Speaker 1>LCD monitors,</v>

169
00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:41.773
<v Speaker 1>that kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A doctor who worked at a hospital in </v>

170
00:09:43.411 --> 00:09:46.470
<v Speaker 1>high San North Korea is an anecdote </v>
<v Speaker 1>today,</v>

171
00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:47.333
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can buy coca cola in the streets of </v>

172
00:09:48.991 --> 00:09:52.080
<v Speaker 1>Pyongyang and according to the South </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean intelligence service,</v>

173
00:09:52.081 --> 00:09:52.914
<v Speaker 1>at least 40 percent of all North Koreans</v>
<v Speaker 1>participate in private activities and </v>

174
00:09:56.671 --> 00:09:58.110
<v Speaker 1>businesses in some way.</v>

175
00:09:58.170 --> 00:10:00.810
<v Speaker 1>That might be surprising to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but there's still more here.</v>

176
00:10:00.870 --> 00:10:03.210
<v Speaker 1>But before we get into all of that is an</v>
<v Speaker 1>important note.</v>

177
00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:07.080
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about a very incipient </v>
<v Speaker 1>process in North Korea.</v>

178
00:10:07.081 --> 00:10:09.240
<v Speaker 1>The government still controls virtually </v>
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>

179
00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:10.103
<v Speaker 1>If these black markets are growing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's because they're being allowed to </v>

180
00:10:12.781 --> 00:10:13.614
<v Speaker 1>grow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is likely because they're more </v>

181
00:10:14.701 --> 00:10:15.690
<v Speaker 1>efficient.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They work,</v>

182
00:10:15.691 --> 00:10:16.524
<v Speaker 1>that's a.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They give the government money and they </v>

183
00:10:17.431 --> 00:10:21.180
<v Speaker 1>allow North Koreans to find a way to </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their living standards.</v>

184
00:10:21.210 --> 00:10:22.043
<v Speaker 1>Something very similar happens in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Soviet Union and in Vietnam and of </v>

185
00:10:25.171 --> 00:10:27.870
<v Speaker 1>course in China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now let's have a look at what else is</v>

186
00:10:27.871 --> 00:10:32.871
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Reforms made in China,</v>

187
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.103
<v Speaker 1>class of merchants and entrepreneurs </v>
<v Speaker 1>that is emerging as a name among North </v>

188
00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:45.930
<v Speaker 1>Koreans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Dome Jew,</v>

189
00:10:46.030 --> 00:10:47.740
<v Speaker 1>and as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many of them,</v>

190
00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.633
<v Speaker 1>especially those who really make money </v>
<v Speaker 1>are people who belong to the Communist </v>

191
00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:52.833
<v Speaker 1>Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ends are well connected in the </v>

192
00:10:53.501 --> 00:10:54.334
<v Speaker 1>government</v>

193
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:00.580
<v Speaker 1>to say they aren't a part of the elite </v>
<v Speaker 1>which they take advantage of,</v>

194
00:11:00.581 --> 00:11:03.150
<v Speaker 1>not only need to get special treatment </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the security forces,</v>

195
00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:06.580
<v Speaker 1>but also to reach advantages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Agreements with public companies.</v>

196
00:11:06.610 --> 00:11:07.443
<v Speaker 1>There are clear suspicions that many </v>
<v Speaker 1>irregular exports are manufactured by </v>

197
00:11:10.571 --> 00:11:11.404
<v Speaker 1>public companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the benefits go to these elite </v>

198
00:11:13.480 --> 00:11:15.850
<v Speaker 1>members.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

199
00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:19.360
<v Speaker 1>this new economic approach isn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>something that bothers the Pyongyang.</v>

200
00:11:19.361 --> 00:11:20.350
<v Speaker 1>Governments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

201
00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:23.710
<v Speaker 1>everything indicates that the North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korean government wants to reproduce the</v>

202
00:11:23.711 --> 00:11:24.544
<v Speaker 1>Chinese model in some way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is to seek foreign investment that </v>

203
00:11:27.161 --> 00:11:31.090
<v Speaker 1>will allow them to grow and develop that</v>
<v Speaker 1>without losing political control.</v>

204
00:11:35.070 --> 00:11:35.340
<v Speaker 2>See,</v>

205
00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:36.173
<v Speaker 1>since Kim Jong came to power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his government has granted more freedom </v>

206
00:11:38.581 --> 00:11:39.414
<v Speaker 1>to public companies so that they can </v>
<v Speaker 1>organize as they wish and to find their </v>

207
00:11:41.940 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>own suppliers and customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is also promoted,</v>

208
00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:45.773
<v Speaker 1>as we've seen private markets.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They turned a blind eye to the black </v>

209
00:11:47.911 --> 00:11:51.420
<v Speaker 1>markets and families and collective </v>
<v Speaker 1>funds now have individual plots assigned</v>

210
00:11:51.421 --> 00:11:53.950
<v Speaker 1>to them who's harvest once they meet the</v>
<v Speaker 1>state.</v>

211
00:11:53.951 --> 00:11:54.784
<v Speaker 1>Criteria can be used as they wish.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They can of course then sell it in the </v>

212
00:11:57.671 --> 00:11:58.504
<v Speaker 1>private market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has even started talking </v>

213
00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:01.233
<v Speaker 1>about special economic zones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I must stress here that this is all </v>

214
00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:05.650
<v Speaker 1>a very new process.</v>

215
00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:09.603
<v Speaker 1>This doesn't mean this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A radical change is going to happen in </v>

216
00:12:11.531 --> 00:12:12.364
<v Speaker 1>the short term.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's due to the official systems in </v>

217
00:12:13.661 --> 00:12:14.494
<v Speaker 1>capacity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The North Koreans are developing an </v>

218
00:12:15.971 --> 00:12:16.804
<v Speaker 1>alternative to improve their standard of</v>
<v Speaker 1>living and even though unfortunately </v>

219
00:12:22.151 --> 00:12:22.984
<v Speaker 1>North Korea is still the totalitarian </v>
<v Speaker 1>and poor country that it was before Kim </v>

220
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.273
<v Speaker 1>Jong Un's arrival.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You contemplate that this new kinds of </v>

221
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.750
<v Speaker 1>parallel economy's growth is somewhat </v>
<v Speaker 1>surprising.</v>

222
00:12:31.810 --> 00:12:32.643
<v Speaker 1>That now is your sound.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think that North Korea will try </v>

223
00:12:34.241 --> 00:12:35.860
<v Speaker 1>to follow the Chinese model?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
