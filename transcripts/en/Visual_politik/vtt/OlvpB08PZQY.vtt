1
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.340
<v Speaker 1>Humans keep developing more and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>powerful weapons and weapons,</v>

2
00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:15.100
<v Speaker 1>the ones they drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then our itinerary came along.</v>

3
00:00:15.101 --> 00:00:18.430
<v Speaker 1>Alan's quite literally blew everything </v>
<v Speaker 1>else out of the water.</v>

4
00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.350
<v Speaker 1>And now today with airplanes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>satellites,</v>

5
00:00:20.351 --> 00:00:21.184
<v Speaker 1>submarines and missiles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have a gain that be changed the way </v>

6
00:00:24.101 --> 00:00:24.934
<v Speaker 1>we make this in facts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>military innovation has produced many </v>

7
00:00:33.211 --> 00:00:36.930
<v Speaker 1>important technological advances,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it all does have a limit.</v>

8
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:37.853
<v Speaker 1>The destructive effects of weapons of </v>
<v Speaker 1>mass destruction or wmds has forced </v>

9
00:00:41.131 --> 00:00:45.370
<v Speaker 1>rules to limit their use of their </v>
<v Speaker 1>production and their storage as well.</v>

10
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.223
<v Speaker 1>This is completely necessary if we don't</v>
<v Speaker 1>want the planet to be well completely </v>

11
00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.480
<v Speaker 1>destroyed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>fight against nuclear proliferation.</v>

12
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.270
<v Speaker 1>Wmds can be biological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>chemical,</v>

13
00:01:03.271 --> 00:01:05.220
<v Speaker 1>radiological,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nuclear,</v>

14
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.000
<v Speaker 1>but the biggest problem we face are </v>
<v Speaker 1>these nuclear weapons.</v>

15
00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.863
<v Speaker 1>This is due to their sheer destructive </v>
<v Speaker 1>power and because thousands and </v>

16
00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>thousands of them were accumulated </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the arms race in the Cold War,</v>

17
00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.180
<v Speaker 1>we will develop a larger and more </v>
<v Speaker 1>accurate c based ballistic missile.</v>

18
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.973
<v Speaker 1>We will also deploy nuclear cruise </v>
<v Speaker 1>missiles in some existing submarines in </v>

19
00:01:26.611 --> 00:01:27.444
<v Speaker 1>the 1960s seventies and eighties art and</v>
<v Speaker 1>music and the civil movements took </v>

20
00:01:30.181 --> 00:01:31.014
<v Speaker 1>action against nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Maybe you remember flower power or at </v>

21
00:01:33.691 --> 00:01:35.210
<v Speaker 1>least you've probably heard of it.</v>

22
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.913
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

23
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.973
<v Speaker 1>Songs which best represents the story of</v>
<v Speaker 1>these years and they do recommend that </v>

24
00:01:41.471 --> 00:01:43.370
<v Speaker 1>you've got to listen to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you haven't already know,</v>

25
00:01:43.371 --> 00:01:45.790
<v Speaker 1>La Gay by orchestral maneuvers in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>dark ends,</v>

26
00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.653
<v Speaker 1>99 red balloons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Real challenge today is keeping North </v>

27
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.373
<v Speaker 1>Korea or Iran from continuing that </v>
<v Speaker 1>programs to develop wmds and further to </v>

28
00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:59.190
<v Speaker 1>keep such weapons out of the hands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorist organizations.</v>

29
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.853
<v Speaker 1>A nuclear crisis in Korea would be a </v>
<v Speaker 1>tragedy and it would certainly affect </v>

30
00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.380
<v Speaker 1>globalization,</v>
<v Speaker 1>trade and all very lifestyles.</v>

31
00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:11.243
<v Speaker 1>Now the problem here is quite condensed </v>
<v Speaker 1>and we should really analyze it from a </v>

32
00:02:13.591 --> 00:02:15.090
<v Speaker 1>global perspective.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As we said,</v>

33
00:02:15.091 --> 00:02:15.924
<v Speaker 1>there are international rules which </v>
<v Speaker 1>limits to the acquisition of nuclear </v>

34
00:02:18.061 --> 00:02:18.894
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These rules are classified into two </v>

35
00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.430
<v Speaker 1>different categories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>horizontal nonproliferation.</v>

36
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
<v Speaker 1>This is meant to prevents countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>which don't have these weapons from </v>

37
00:02:26.431 --> 00:02:27.264
<v Speaker 1>obtaining them and then there is </v>
<v Speaker 1>vertical nonproliferation and this is </v>

38
00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.090
<v Speaker 1>meant to stop states already in </v>
<v Speaker 1>possession of nuclear weapons,</v>

39
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.720
<v Speaker 1>especially the US and Russia from </v>
<v Speaker 1>increasing the number of nuclear weapons</v>

40
00:02:36.721 --> 00:02:40.140
<v Speaker 1>they have and even encouraging,</v>
<v Speaker 1>reducing the stock piles,</v>

41
00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.260
<v Speaker 1>horizontal non-proliferation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The NP</v>

42
00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.560
<v Speaker 2>horizontal</v>

43
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.393
<v Speaker 1>nonproliferation tries to prevent a new </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries from joining the nuclear club </v>

44
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.180
<v Speaker 1>as obviously it's specifically aims to </v>
<v Speaker 1>prevent countries like Iran,</v>

45
00:02:58.270 --> 00:02:59.103
<v Speaker 1>North Korea,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well as terrorist organizations from </v>

46
00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.310
<v Speaker 1>getting these weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

47
00:03:03.311 --> 00:03:04.144
<v Speaker 1>You might remember now that we did </v>
<v Speaker 1>another video on this where we talked </v>

48
00:03:05.891 --> 00:03:06.724
<v Speaker 1>about how the rules aren't really </v>
<v Speaker 1>working so well in the case of North </v>

49
00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:10.150
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

50
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.983
<v Speaker 1>this is what the NPT has achieved since </v>
<v Speaker 1>1968 in the early sixties it was </v>

51
00:03:14.441 --> 00:03:19.441
<v Speaker 1>estimated that by the year 2000 around </v>
<v Speaker 1>20 countries would hold nuclear weapons.</v>

52
00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.260
<v Speaker 1>Many countries like Algeria,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Roger,</v>

53
00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:22.031
<v Speaker 1>Dina,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>

54
00:03:22.031 --> 00:03:22.864
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Sweden had the ability to develop </v>

55
00:03:24.731 --> 00:03:25.870
<v Speaker 1>these weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

56
00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.330
<v Speaker 1>thanks to the NPT and international </v>
<v Speaker 1>leverage,</v>

57
00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.120
<v Speaker 1>very few states are in possession of </v>
<v Speaker 1>these weapons today.</v>

58
00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.053
<v Speaker 3>Yeah,</v>

59
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:34.203
<v Speaker 4>clear non proliferation treaty </v>
<v Speaker 4>established at the five permanent </v>

60
00:03:37.031 --> 00:03:40.510
<v Speaker 4>members of the Security Council,</v>
<v Speaker 4>which at first where the United States,</v>

61
00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.400
<v Speaker 4>the Soviet Union,</v>
<v Speaker 4>China,</v>

62
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.530
<v Speaker 4>France,</v>
<v Speaker 4>and United Kingdom.</v>

63
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:45.453
<v Speaker 4>We're the only nuclear powers and it </v>
<v Speaker 4>forbade other states from acquiring </v>

64
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.170
<v Speaker 4>nuclear weapons.</v>

65
00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.930
<v Speaker 3>It looks great.</v>

66
00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:53.763
<v Speaker 1>The members of the nuclear club,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the five nuclear powers would commit to </v>

67
00:03:56.331 --> 00:03:59.950
<v Speaker 1>help the rest of the countries develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear energy for civil public.</v>

68
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.700
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with time and despite all of this,</v>

69
00:04:05.701 --> 00:04:08.970
<v Speaker 1>some countries have succeeded in </v>
<v Speaker 1>becoming nuclear powers today.</v>

70
00:04:08.971 --> 00:04:11.130
<v Speaker 1>Besides the five powers previously </v>
<v Speaker 1>mentioned,</v>

71
00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.760
<v Speaker 1>four more countries have developed </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons.</v>

72
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.060
<v Speaker 1>That's Israel,</v>
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>

73
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:16.920
<v Speaker 1>Pakistan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to North Korea.</v>

74
00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.560
<v Speaker 1>And then there's Iran,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also try it.</v>

75
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.200
<v Speaker 1>You'll probably know that during the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Ahmadinejad administration,</v>

76
00:04:22.201 --> 00:04:24.270
<v Speaker 1>Iran tried to develop one of these </v>
<v Speaker 1>bombs,</v>

77
00:04:24.271 --> 00:04:25.104
<v Speaker 1>and this would have meant there would be</v>
<v Speaker 1>a significant threat to both Israel as </v>

78
00:04:27.931 --> 00:04:30.090
<v Speaker 1>well as the Middle Eastern Region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But fortunately,</v>

79
00:04:30.091 --> 00:04:30.924
<v Speaker 1>the international community took action </v>
<v Speaker 1>to flank that possibility and the </v>

80
00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.550
<v Speaker 1>sanctions leveled by the Security </v>
<v Speaker 1>Council,</v>

81
00:04:35.551 --> 00:04:36.384
<v Speaker 1>damaged Iran's oil and gas exports and </v>
<v Speaker 1>badly and all of that international </v>

82
00:04:39.721 --> 00:04:40.554
<v Speaker 1>pressure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has an impact because in the next </v>

83
00:04:41.641 --> 00:04:42.474
<v Speaker 1>elections,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Rohani became the president of the </v>

84
00:04:43.651 --> 00:04:44.484
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was a more moderate candidates to </v>

85
00:04:46.411 --> 00:04:47.244
<v Speaker 1>very harsh negotiations.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In 2015 they reached an agreement in </v>

86
00:04:49.831 --> 00:04:52.770
<v Speaker 1>which Iran stopped its nuclear agenda </v>
<v Speaker 1>and in exchange,</v>

87
00:04:52.771 --> 00:04:55.500
<v Speaker 1>the rest of the countries would lift </v>
<v Speaker 1>sanctions on exports,</v>

88
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.550
<v Speaker 1>which was good news in a country like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Iran or wary lack of exports was causing</v>

89
00:04:59.551 --> 00:05:01.740
<v Speaker 1>significant damage to its economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:02.603
<v Speaker 1>now we come to North Korea ans maybe we </v>
<v Speaker 1>should let it to leader speak for </v>

91
00:05:05.911 --> 00:05:06.750
<v Speaker 1>himself.</v>

92
00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.000
<v Speaker 4>Median Kim doing it.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Don't get caught.</v>

93
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.250
<v Speaker 4>Some God that he does.</v>

94
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.273
<v Speaker 1>We don't exactly know what weapons North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea possesses or there's some </v>

95
00:05:15.741 --> 00:05:17.840
<v Speaker 1>estimates say as we mentioned in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>previous video,</v>

96
00:05:17.841 --> 00:05:18.674
<v Speaker 1>could it's from 10 to 20 bombs.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These are unsophisticated but still </v>

97
00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:24.860
<v Speaker 1>powerful enough to trigger a significant</v>
<v Speaker 1>crisis.</v>

98
00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:25.723
<v Speaker 1>For this reason,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the United Nations Security Council has </v>

99
00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.034
<v Speaker 1>strengthened the penalty system for </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea after the last underground </v>

100
00:05:30.681 --> 00:05:35.681
<v Speaker 1>detonation in September of 2016 the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presses even dead to speculates that the</v>

101
00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:37.623
<v Speaker 1>might be preventative and military </v>
<v Speaker 1>action against North Korea by the trump </v>

102
00:05:40.281 --> 00:05:41.480
<v Speaker 1>administration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

103
00:05:41.481 --> 00:05:45.140
<v Speaker 1>American experts are wanting this </v>
<v Speaker 1>military action could trigger a military</v>

104
00:05:45.141 --> 00:05:45.974
<v Speaker 1>response with wmds as well as </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional weaponry or war in the </v>

105
00:05:48.981 --> 00:05:49.814
<v Speaker 1>Korean peninsula would mean a human </v>
<v Speaker 1>catastrophe and it would negatively </v>

106
00:05:52.551 --> 00:05:56.150
<v Speaker 1>affect the world's economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It would most of all affected neighbors,</v>

107
00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.140
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>south,</v>

108
00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.080
<v Speaker 1>and Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the mere existence of this threat of</v>

109
00:06:00.081 --> 00:06:00.914
<v Speaker 1>war could lead to a terrifying arms race</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the region and it could even make </v>

110
00:06:03.531 --> 00:06:04.364
<v Speaker 1>Japan take exceptional measures.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is something we've talked about in </v>

111
00:06:06.741 --> 00:06:07.574
<v Speaker 1>a previous video that you can see here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That is why it's important for China to </v>

112
00:06:10.881 --> 00:06:13.250
<v Speaker 1>end it's friendly relationship with </v>
<v Speaker 1>North Korea.</v>

113
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.960
<v Speaker 1>It's not going to end well for China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>More overwhelmed,</v>

114
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:21.070
<v Speaker 2>general vertical non-proliferation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wow,</v>

115
00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:24.510
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A vertical nonproliferation.</v>

116
00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.353
<v Speaker 1>During the Cold War,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the u s and the Soviet Union developed </v>

117
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:32.080
<v Speaker 1>more and more powerful nuclear weapons </v>
<v Speaker 1>in greater and greater numbers.</v>

118
00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.440
<v Speaker 1>Each country needed to have more into </v>
<v Speaker 1>better weapons than the other two.</v>

119
00:06:35.441 --> 00:06:38.530
<v Speaker 1>These stored thousands and thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear warheads.</v>

120
00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.230
<v Speaker 1>They also increased their means of </v>
<v Speaker 1>delivering aircraft,</v>

121
00:06:41.231 --> 00:06:45.760
<v Speaker 1>missile submarines all to an extent that</v>
<v Speaker 1>had previously not even been imagined</v>

122
00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:48.723
<v Speaker 4>during the cold war arms race.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The global nuclear stockpile peaked in </v>

123
00:06:53.471 --> 00:06:54.304
<v Speaker 4>1986 at about 70,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>nuclear warheads according to the </v>

124
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:00.243
<v Speaker 4>Federation of American scientists,</v>
<v Speaker 4>enough to destroy the earth several </v>

125
00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:03.183
<v Speaker 4>times.</v>

126
00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.153
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

127
00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:06.153
<v Speaker 1>In Louisiana is the woman he tests with </v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear weapons conducted in the </v>

128
00:07:08.231 --> 00:07:09.610
<v Speaker 1>atmosphere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the sea,</v>

129
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.473
<v Speaker 1>in space,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and sometimes whether intentionally or </v>

130
00:07:12.641 --> 00:07:13.474
<v Speaker 1>not,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they used people as Guinea pigs do </v>

131
00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.350
<v Speaker 1>analyze the effects of radioactivity in </v>
<v Speaker 1>humans.</v>

132
00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:18.243
<v Speaker 1>It was all a pretty terrible time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese artist Hashimoto has </v>

133
00:07:21.491 --> 00:07:25.630
<v Speaker 1>prepared a video where you can see the </v>
<v Speaker 1>different nuclear tests since 1945</v>

134
00:07:29.900 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>it looks like a video game,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's not.</v>

135
00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:33.750
<v Speaker 1>Fortunately with the end of the Cold </v>
<v Speaker 1>War,</v>

136
00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:34.584
<v Speaker 1>the United States and Russia agreed to </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce the nuclear arsenals as well as </v>

137
00:07:37.771 --> 00:07:41.250
<v Speaker 1>their means of delivery.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Under President Obama written April,</v>

138
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.440
<v Speaker 1>2010 the staunch treaty was signed in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prague.</v>

139
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:45.810
<v Speaker 1>This treaty agency limit strategic </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons,</v>

140
00:07:45.870 --> 00:07:46.703
<v Speaker 1>so each country would only hold 1,500</v>
<v Speaker 1>nuclear bombs like the year 2018 but </v>

141
00:07:51.241 --> 00:07:52.074
<v Speaker 1>still that is way too many bombers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are also other rules to limit </v>

142
00:07:55.291 --> 00:07:57.510
<v Speaker 1>missiles and means of delivery and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course,</v>

143
00:07:57.511 --> 00:07:58.344
<v Speaker 1>no more nuclear testing is permitted.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So ctbt is a treaty which completely </v>

144
00:08:01.111 --> 00:08:01.944
<v Speaker 1>forbids any nuclear tests and no more </v>
<v Speaker 1>tests have been carried out since 1998 </v>

145
00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:08.100
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of course being North</v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>

146
00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:08.993
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conclusion of all of this is that </v>

147
00:08:10.531 --> 00:08:11.364
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we must definitely stop the </v>

148
00:08:12.361 --> 00:08:16.500
<v Speaker 1>proliferation of nuclear weapons in Iran</v>
<v Speaker 1>or North Korea and we sat and we have to</v>

149
00:08:16.501 --> 00:08:20.100
<v Speaker 1>prevent terrorist groups from laying </v>
<v Speaker 1>their hands on these WMDs,</v>

150
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:20.963
<v Speaker 1>but the nuclear arsenals that still </v>
<v Speaker 1>exist in the u s and Russia should also </v>

151
00:08:24.181 --> 00:08:26.250
<v Speaker 1>keep reducing because among other </v>
<v Speaker 1>things,</v>

152
00:08:26.251 --> 00:08:27.084
<v Speaker 1>the risk of misuse and lack of control </v>
<v Speaker 1>of these weapons is waste presence in </v>

153
00:08:30.751 --> 00:08:34.080
<v Speaker 1>the world we inhabit today and to </v>
<v Speaker 1>dependence and globalized wars.</v>

154
00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:36.000
<v Speaker 1>They don't make any steps.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bernard Brodie,</v>

155
00:08:36.001 --> 00:08:39.270
<v Speaker 1>the North American strategist already </v>
<v Speaker 1>said this after World War II</v>

156
00:08:41.130 --> 00:08:41.963
<v Speaker 4>thus far.</v>
<v Speaker 4>The chief purpose of our military </v>

157
00:08:43.081 --> 00:08:48.081
<v Speaker 4>establishment has been to when Moore's </v>
<v Speaker 4>from now on its chief purpose must be to</v>

158
00:08:48.121 --> 00:08:48.954
<v Speaker 4>avert them</v>

159
00:08:50.060 --> 00:08:50.893
<v Speaker 1>in the u s president John F.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy was a pioneer in the search of </v>

160
00:08:53.421 --> 00:08:54.980
<v Speaker 1>peace and nuclear disarmament.</v>

161
00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:55.973
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

162
00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:03.660
<v Speaker 5>Too many of us think it is impossible to</v>
<v Speaker 5>many think it is unreal,</v>

163
00:09:04.470 --> 00:09:07.590
<v Speaker 5>but that is a dangerous your fetus </v>
<v Speaker 5>believe.</v>

164
00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:12.420
<v Speaker 5>It leads to the conclusion that war is </v>
<v Speaker 5>inevitable,</v>

165
00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.943
<v Speaker 5>that mankind is doomed,</v>
<v Speaker 5>that we are gripped by forces we cannot </v>

166
00:09:18.661 --> 00:09:19.494
<v Speaker 5>control.</v>
<v Speaker 5>We need not accept that view our </v>

167
00:09:23.141 --> 00:09:24.570
<v Speaker 5>problems,</v>
<v Speaker 5>a manmade,</v>

168
00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:27.570
<v Speaker 5>therefore they can be solved by man</v>

169
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.233
<v Speaker 1>in a world dominated by nuclear weapons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kennedy's he refused to conduct any </v>

170
00:09:37.731 --> 00:09:38.564
<v Speaker 1>nuclear tests in the atmosphere and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>was criticized for that in his own </v>

171
00:09:41.121 --> 00:09:41.960
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

172
00:09:41.961 --> 00:09:42.794
<v Speaker 1>we could have avoided so much suffering </v>
<v Speaker 1>and saved a huge amount of money if the </v>

173
00:09:45.861 --> 00:09:49.550
<v Speaker 1>wells had just listened to Kennedy's </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideas on nuclear weapons.</v>

174
00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:51.560
<v Speaker 1>So I really hope you enjoyed that video.</v>
