1
00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:11.540
<v Speaker 1>California is one of the states with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>highest taxes in all of America.</v>

2
00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.000
<v Speaker 1>There's also one of the most expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>places to live.</v>

3
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.953
<v Speaker 1>If this wasn't bad enough,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the California and government is never </v>

4
00:00:17.541 --> 00:00:22.541
<v Speaker 1>ending risk of bankruptcy with a brutal </v>
<v Speaker 1>amounts of debt and to launch fiscal,</v>

5
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:27.523
<v Speaker 1>but despite all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>California is home to the third richest </v>

6
00:00:31.101 --> 00:00:34.340
<v Speaker 1>and most prosperous region on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>planet.</v>

7
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.750
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>dear viewers,</v>

8
00:00:35.751 --> 00:00:36.584
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about the Santa Clara </v>

9
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.530
<v Speaker 1>Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you say?</v>

10
00:00:39.531 --> 00:00:40.610
<v Speaker 1>You've never heard of it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:40.611 --> 00:00:41.444
<v Speaker 1>actually I have because it's better </v>
<v Speaker 1>known by its own official name of </v>

12
00:00:45.201 --> 00:00:46.034
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the place where companies like </v>

13
00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:49.220
<v Speaker 1>Google,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apple,</v>

14
00:00:49.221 --> 00:00:54.221
<v Speaker 1>and facebook were all born in total.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Thirty nine of the 100 biggest companies</v>

15
00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:58.700
<v Speaker 1>in the entire world have their </v>
<v Speaker 1>headquarters in this place,</v>

16
00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.653
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Silicon valley is not a big metropolis </v>

17
00:01:02.331 --> 00:01:04.670
<v Speaker 1>like New York City or London.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.820
<v Speaker 1>the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

19
00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.670
<v Speaker 2>Straight</v>

20
00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:11.093
<v Speaker 1>cities like Cupertino,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Palo Alto and mountain view have a </v>

21
00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.940
<v Speaker 1>little more than 60,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>

22
00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.870
<v Speaker 1>Menlo Park where facebook headquarters </v>
<v Speaker 1>are located as a smaller population than</v>

23
00:01:19.871 --> 00:01:22.720
<v Speaker 1>a small town in Kansas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in this region,</v>

24
00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.900
<v Speaker 1>the average salary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so policy is $10,000</v>

25
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:29.910
<v Speaker 1>a month and it's home to many of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's largest billionaires.</v>

26
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.440
<v Speaker 1>And if you're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer is no.</v>

27
00:01:32.441 --> 00:01:36.460
<v Speaker 1>There is no silicon mine in the Santa </v>
<v Speaker 1>Clara Valley whatsoever.</v>

28
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.473
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the name Silicon Valley was coined in </v>

29
00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:39.364
<v Speaker 1>the 19 seventies because this is when </v>
<v Speaker 1>microchips and semiconductors made out </v>

30
00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:44.340
<v Speaker 1>of silicon manufacturer.</v>

31
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.353
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

32
00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:50.343
<v Speaker 1>Don't go looking for any natural </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources in this part of the world </v>

33
00:01:52.571 --> 00:01:53.404
<v Speaker 1>because you won't find any.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now we come to the real question of </v>

34
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.330
<v Speaker 1>why here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

35
00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.223
<v Speaker 1>what's so special about this area?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Why not northern California or why not </v>

36
00:02:02.831 --> 00:02:06.010
<v Speaker 1>New York or Chicago or any other place </v>
<v Speaker 1>for that matter?</v>

37
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.370
<v Speaker 1>That was easy to understand why </v>
<v Speaker 1>somewhere like Switzerland is so rich,</v>

38
00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:10.204
<v Speaker 1>they have low taxes and an excellent </v>
<v Speaker 1>political system than Saudi Arabia and </v>

39
00:02:13.691 --> 00:02:14.524
<v Speaker 1>they're rich because they've got oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The silicon valley is very different </v>

40
00:02:16.391 --> 00:02:19.450
<v Speaker 1>from those places and it's very </v>
<v Speaker 1>different from other places in America.</v>

41
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.343
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's got those high taxes we mentioned </v>

42
00:02:21.461 --> 00:02:23.320
<v Speaker 1>and believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the taxes are really,</v>

43
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:24.580
<v Speaker 1>really high.</v>

44
00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.030
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 3>imagine that you a top executive and you</v>

45
00:02:29.031 --> 00:02:32.120
<v Speaker 3>make half a million bucks a year.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If you lived in Texas,</v>

46
00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.180
<v Speaker 3>you'd pay around 32 percent in income </v>
<v Speaker 3>tax.</v>

47
00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.670
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

48
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.510
<v Speaker 3>However,</v>
<v Speaker 3>in California you would pay 42 percent.</v>

49
00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.940
<v Speaker 3>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the difference is meaningful.</v>

50
00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:46.023
<v Speaker 1>So again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why Silicon Valley and North Texas or </v>

51
00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.353
<v Speaker 1>Delaware or Nevada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what makes this region quite so special </v>

52
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.410
<v Speaker 1>for startup,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and even more importantly than that,</v>

53
00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.263
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is a start up and how is created </v>

54
00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.970
<v Speaker 1>well in today's we're going to answer </v>
<v Speaker 1>all of those questions,</v>

55
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.640
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look back at the history.</v>

56
00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.153
<v Speaker 1>The trader is there all times in history</v>
<v Speaker 1>when several coincidences happen all at </v>

57
00:03:12.991 --> 00:03:15.840
<v Speaker 1>once and this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the miracle of cylinder.</v>

58
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.113
<v Speaker 1>Our story starts in the year 1956 with a</v>
<v Speaker 1>company called Shockley semiconductor </v>

59
00:03:21.151 --> 00:03:21.984
<v Speaker 1>lab.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the first company in the </v>

60
00:03:23.611 --> 00:03:26.290
<v Speaker 1>valley to manufacturers silicon based </v>
<v Speaker 1>micro jets.</v>

61
00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:29.730
<v Speaker 1>Their offices were in a little village </v>
<v Speaker 1>with no more than 7,000</v>

62
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:30.564
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was a village called mountain view </v>

63
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.370
<v Speaker 1>located on the outskirts of San </v>
<v Speaker 1>Francisco.</v>

64
00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.640
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nobody talked about silicon valley,</v>

65
00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:43.503
<v Speaker 1>but of course the San Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 1>Peninsula was one of the tech capitals </v>

66
00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:46.753
<v Speaker 1>of America night.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's actually the radon is used by the </v>

67
00:03:48.941 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>army were manufactured by a company that</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might have heard of,</v>

68
00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:53.710
<v Speaker 1>Hewlett Packard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

69
00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:54.603
<v Speaker 1>Stanford University generated skilled </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals ready to work in rocket </v>

70
00:03:58.001 --> 00:03:59.850
<v Speaker 1>science,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but let's get back to art.</v>

71
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:00.693
<v Speaker 1>Friends are shopping.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were the most advanced company in </v>

72
00:04:02.981 --> 00:04:05.680
<v Speaker 1>their fields and perhaps this company </v>
<v Speaker 1>could have gone very,</v>

73
00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:07.000
<v Speaker 1>very far.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bonds,</v>

74
00:04:07.001 --> 00:04:07.834
<v Speaker 1>they had a big problem,</v>
<v Speaker 1>apparently people in the company who </v>

75
00:04:09.851 --> 00:04:11.610
<v Speaker 1>felt that their boss was a bit of a</v>

76
00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:12.573
<v Speaker 2>Dick,</v>

77
00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.480
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

78
00:04:17.481 --> 00:04:19.310
<v Speaker 1>one day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>eight of the youngest work isn't.</v>

79
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:23.200
<v Speaker 1>The company went to Mr Shockley his </v>
<v Speaker 1>office and essentially said Shockley,</v>

80
00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.080
<v Speaker 1>you could take your stupid ass company </v>
<v Speaker 1>and stick it up your ass.</v>

81
00:04:27.081 --> 00:04:29.000
<v Speaker 1>We're the ones who designed your </v>
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>

82
00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.930
<v Speaker 1>We're the brains of this business,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're going to get outta here,</v>

83
00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:35.990
<v Speaker 1>start our own business and kick ass </v>
<v Speaker 1>without you.</v>

84
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.883
<v Speaker 1>These eight,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and then became known as the traitorous </v>

85
00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 1>eight.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Their average age was 30,</v>

86
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.283
<v Speaker 1>they had no money whatsoever and they </v>
<v Speaker 1>wanted to start a state of the art </v>

87
00:04:44.721 --> 00:04:49.721
<v Speaker 1>technology company that required a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>of investments and you might be thinking</v>

88
00:04:52.271 --> 00:04:52.841
<v Speaker 1>now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

89
00:04:52.841 --> 00:04:57.250
<v Speaker 1>which banks lend the money and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>answer to that is absolutely not.</v>

90
00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.353
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pay attention here because this was the </v>

91
00:05:00.191 --> 00:05:03.730
<v Speaker 1>beginning of something really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>really big in 1959,</v>

92
00:05:03.731 --> 00:05:05.770
<v Speaker 1>the first venture capital funded </v>
<v Speaker 1>company.</v>

93
00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:06.733
<v Speaker 1>It was born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a second year because I do </v>

94
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:09.970
<v Speaker 1>want to explain what that actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>means.</v>

95
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.940
<v Speaker 1>You have an idea since the beginning of </v>
<v Speaker 1>capitalism,</v>

96
00:05:16.941 --> 00:05:17.774
<v Speaker 1>there have been people with money </v>
<v Speaker 1>willing to partner with people who had </v>

97
00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.020
<v Speaker 1>ideas and together they started </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

98
00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:25.560
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless.</v>
<v Speaker 1>After World War Two,</v>

99
00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.473
<v Speaker 1>lots of soldiers came home from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>battlefields and one out of every two </v>

100
00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:31.280
<v Speaker 1>veterans they wanted to start a company</v>

101
00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:36.440
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

102
00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.540
<v Speaker 1>all of a sudden there was a spike in </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand for financing.</v>

103
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:40.583
<v Speaker 1>This is why many of the people with </v>
<v Speaker 1>money started rethinking the way that </v>

104
00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:45.510
<v Speaker 1>businesses use to work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>

105
00:05:45.511 --> 00:05:48.990
<v Speaker 1>there's Laurance Rockefeller from the </v>
<v Speaker 1>famous Rockefeller family.</v>

106
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:51.900
<v Speaker 1>This man had something more than lots of</v>
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

107
00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:56.990
<v Speaker 1>He also knew other people who had money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so essentially one day in 1959,</v>

108
00:05:57.591 --> 00:06:00.380
<v Speaker 1>he called them all up and said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>listen up ditch chops,</v>

109
00:06:00.381 --> 00:06:03.320
<v Speaker 1>put down your champagne glasses and your</v>
<v Speaker 1>caviar for a second,</v>

110
00:06:03.321 --> 00:06:04.154
<v Speaker 1>the shy and your monocle and pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention because I just found eight </v>

111
00:06:06.891 --> 00:06:10.160
<v Speaker 1>guys in California who have a great </v>
<v Speaker 1>business idea that very,</v>

112
00:06:10.161 --> 00:06:10.994
<v Speaker 1>very clever and they want to develop </v>
<v Speaker 1>some weird stuff with lots of </v>

113
00:06:14.061 --> 00:06:14.894
<v Speaker 1>technology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's got silicone and other things I </v>

114
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:19.790
<v Speaker 1>don't understand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but if you fancy this idea,</v>

115
00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.610
<v Speaker 1>give me your money invested in said </v>
<v Speaker 1>business,</v>

116
00:06:22.611 --> 00:06:26.240
<v Speaker 1>and if it all goes well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>will become even richer than we are now.</v>

117
00:06:26.241 --> 00:06:27.074
<v Speaker 1>Pip,</v>
<v Speaker 1>pip,</v>

118
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.380
<v Speaker 1>and say it wasn't was sad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it was done.</v>

119
00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:37.410
<v Speaker 1>This is how in 1959,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the traitorous eight from Silicon Valley</v>

120
00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.283
<v Speaker 1>started fairchild semiconductors with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the money from Rockefeller and his </v>

121
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:44.080
<v Speaker 1>billionaire friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was the first time.</v>

122
00:06:44.081 --> 00:06:44.914
<v Speaker 1>It wasn't just one rich dude investing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but a collective society of rich dudes </v>

123
00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.920
<v Speaker 1>instead,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this.</v>

124
00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.903
<v Speaker 1>This is how the first venture capital </v>
<v Speaker 1>fund called Venn rock associated was </v>

125
00:06:55.421 --> 00:06:56.254
<v Speaker 1>born,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and guess where they have their </v>

126
00:06:57.881 --> 00:06:59.350
<v Speaker 1>headquarters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

127
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.900
<v Speaker 1>that's Palo Alto.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This was silicon,</v>

128
00:07:06.350 --> 00:07:07.183
<v Speaker 1>so this was a really risky idea and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that's why these funds are call of </v>

129
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.630
<v Speaker 1>venture capital funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

130
00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:14.030
<v Speaker 1>if you put your money into a big company</v>
<v Speaker 1>like Coca Cola,</v>

131
00:07:14.031 --> 00:07:16.760
<v Speaker 1>you'll lose or win a little bit of </v>
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>

132
00:07:16.761 --> 00:07:19.790
<v Speaker 1>but it's really hard to go fully </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankrupt nonetheless,</v>

133
00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.380
<v Speaker 1>giving money to a guy with nothing but </v>
<v Speaker 1>an idea that's a pretty risky Joel.</v>

134
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.240
<v Speaker 1>So well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the advantage?</v>

135
00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.660
<v Speaker 1>Then?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course it's that if it goes right,</v>

136
00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:35.420
<v Speaker 1>you get stupidly rich and so then we </v>
<v Speaker 1>have to answer the question,</v>

137
00:07:35.421 --> 00:07:37.640
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the secret of success?</v>

138
00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.480
<v Speaker 1>Of course you do want to invest in lots </v>
<v Speaker 1>of different companies at the same time.</v>

139
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:45.860
<v Speaker 1>You need just one out of 10 to be </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful to make it worthwhile.</v>

140
00:07:45.950 --> 00:07:46.783
<v Speaker 1>And the truth is that Rockefeller and </v>
<v Speaker 1>his other fellows made a hell of an </v>

141
00:07:49.221 --> 00:07:50.270
<v Speaker 1>investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Actually,</v>

142
00:07:50.271 --> 00:07:54.950
<v Speaker 1>the company still exists today and has </v>
<v Speaker 1>offices all over the world,</v>

143
00:07:55.070 --> 00:07:58.820
<v Speaker 1>and so what happens when one person gets</v>
<v Speaker 1>stupidly rich by doing something?</v>

144
00:07:58.820 --> 00:07:59.653
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a lot of copycats spring up out of the </v>

145
00:08:01.671 --> 00:08:03.740
<v Speaker 1>blue trying to do the same thing by the </v>
<v Speaker 1>year.</v>

146
00:08:03.741 --> 00:08:04.574
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 82.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were already 12 vc funds in </v>

147
00:08:07.551 --> 00:08:09.110
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley,</v>
<v Speaker 1>their philosophy,</v>

148
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.200
<v Speaker 1>it was simple,</v>
<v Speaker 1>get private money from investors,</v>

149
00:08:12.201 --> 00:08:13.034
<v Speaker 1>pension plans,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and of course all those rich dudes and </v>

150
00:08:15.051 --> 00:08:15.884
<v Speaker 1>then a team of specialized professionals</v>
<v Speaker 1>meet entrepreneurs and startups looking </v>

151
00:08:18.831 --> 00:08:20.570
<v Speaker 1>for good ideas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>

152
00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:23.870
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley has an old car of guys </v>
<v Speaker 1>who study at Stanford.</v>

153
00:08:23.871 --> 00:08:25.760
<v Speaker 1>Clever guys.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You study somewhere else,</v>

154
00:08:25.761 --> 00:08:27.950
<v Speaker 1>but eventually emigrated till the </v>
<v Speaker 1>valley.</v>

155
00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:31.030
<v Speaker 1>A network of companies that make it easy</v>
<v Speaker 1>to start any business.</v>

156
00:08:31.580 --> 00:08:33.800
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a ton of money.</v>

157
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:34.461
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

158
00:08:34.461 --> 00:08:35.294
<v Speaker 1>so this all sounds pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but what does a Silicon Valley company </v>

159
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:39.343
<v Speaker 1>actually look like?</v>
<v Speaker 1>How does this startup system and VC </v>

160
00:08:41.481 --> 00:08:43.250
<v Speaker 1>funds actually work?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

161
00:08:43.310 --> 00:08:44.330
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shall We?</v>

162
00:08:48.030 --> 00:08:50.870
<v Speaker 1>Silicon Valley way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know I know the word stars.</v>

163
00:08:50.871 --> 00:08:51.704
<v Speaker 1>I'm has already become another buzzword </v>
<v Speaker 1>that stupid people used to sound </v>

164
00:08:53.941 --> 00:08:55.080
<v Speaker 1>smarter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So then.</v>

165
00:08:55.260 --> 00:08:56.093
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the difference between a normal </v>

166
00:08:57.301 --> 00:08:59.220
<v Speaker 1>company and a startup?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

167
00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:04.520
<v Speaker 1>here's a good definition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a company designed to grow fast.</v>

168
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:08.253
<v Speaker 1>Paul Graham,</v>
<v Speaker 1>founder of Yahoo Store and venture </v>

169
00:09:10.601 --> 00:09:11.950
<v Speaker 1>capital investor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

170
00:09:11.951 --> 00:09:13.780
<v Speaker 1>so now I can probably guess what you're </v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking.</v>

171
00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.030
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>company is designed to grow fast.</v>

172
00:09:16.210 --> 00:09:20.290
<v Speaker 1>Well actually no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>just look at Ikea is a good example.</v>

173
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.710
<v Speaker 1>Ikea is one of the most successful </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies of all time,</v>

174
00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.220
<v Speaker 1>but his main principles since the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning has been to grow only with its</v>

175
00:09:27.221 --> 00:09:29.890
<v Speaker 1>own funds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No debt from banks or hedge fund</v>

176
00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.290
<v Speaker 1>that unlike other companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ikea took a long time to grow,</v>

177
00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:39.990
<v Speaker 1>but he was healthy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consistent growth.</v>

178
00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:43.530
<v Speaker 1>So now the question still remains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>What is a startup?</v>

179
00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:46.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook would be a great example here.</v>

180
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:47.280
<v Speaker 1>Why?</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

181
00:09:47.310 --> 00:09:48.143
<v Speaker 1>because it's a scalable business.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means it doesn't matter if they </v>

182
00:09:50.971 --> 00:09:55.200
<v Speaker 1>have one or a million uses.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The spending is almost the same,</v>

183
00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.153
<v Speaker 1>but not only that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook is the perfect example of what </v>

184
00:09:57.931 --> 00:10:02.180
<v Speaker 1>we know as the startup financing cycle </v>
<v Speaker 1>and pay attention here because this.</v>

185
00:10:02.181 --> 00:10:05.040
<v Speaker 1>This is really key in understanding how </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley</v>

186
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.523
<v Speaker 2>wow</v>

187
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.630
<v Speaker 1>first step is what we know as the valley</v>
<v Speaker 1>of death.</v>

188
00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:14.050
<v Speaker 1>Why is it called this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

189
00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:17.310
<v Speaker 1>because this is the stage when most </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects don't survive.</v>

190
00:10:17.430 --> 00:10:18.930
<v Speaker 1>In the case of facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have our friends,</v>

191
00:10:18.931 --> 00:10:22.800
<v Speaker 1>Mark Zuckerberg and Edwardo Savrin who </v>
<v Speaker 1>had a great business idea,</v>

192
00:10:22.890 --> 00:10:26.250
<v Speaker 1>but an idea by itself has little or no </v>
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>

193
00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.680
<v Speaker 1>You have to execute on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So these new friends,</v>

194
00:10:28.681 --> 00:10:32.520
<v Speaker 1>they put down money out of their own </v>
<v Speaker 1>pockets to launch their first prototype,</v>

195
00:10:32.521 --> 00:10:35.730
<v Speaker 1>which was the facebook.com</v>
<v Speaker 1>and well,</v>

196
00:10:35.830 --> 00:10:38.670
<v Speaker 1>you know the rest of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Suddenly all of the students,</v>

197
00:10:38.700 --> 00:10:41.550
<v Speaker 1>Harvard University,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had an account next stage.</v>

198
00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:42.413
<v Speaker 1>Well that was to become a serious </v>
<v Speaker 1>company with work as officers and other </v>

199
00:10:45.841 --> 00:10:48.270
<v Speaker 1>important stuff like that and valeant </v>
<v Speaker 1>bought and stuff.</v>

200
00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:51.630
<v Speaker 1>You need money as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they have any money?</v>

201
00:10:51.870 --> 00:10:52.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

202
00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:53.753
<v Speaker 1>So what did they do while they went to </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley and they met this guy at </v>

203
00:10:56.350 --> 00:10:58.780
<v Speaker 1>that you see here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>his name is Peter</v>

204
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:07.420
<v Speaker 2>and</v>

205
00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.253
<v Speaker 1>listen up here because this is the first</v>
<v Speaker 1>difference between the valley and the </v>

206
00:11:11.171 --> 00:11:12.004
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a teal is what we know as an angel </v>

207
00:11:14.711 --> 00:11:15.544
<v Speaker 1>investor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He's a guy with a lot of money and he's </v>

208
00:11:17.231 --> 00:11:18.064
<v Speaker 1>willing to invest in companies that are </v>
<v Speaker 1>still in this valley of death at this </v>

209
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:22.780
<v Speaker 1>moment,</v>
<v Speaker 1>2004.</v>

210
00:11:22.781 --> 00:11:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Facebook was an idea with a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 1>potential,</v>

211
00:11:25.121 --> 00:11:25.954
<v Speaker 1>but almost no profit investment.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was so risky that no bank woodlands </v>

212
00:11:29.591 --> 00:11:31.890
<v Speaker 1>any money to them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead Peter Teal,</v>

213
00:11:31.920 --> 00:11:35.050
<v Speaker 1>but $500,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>into facebook with this,</v>

214
00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.770
<v Speaker 1>he was buying 10 percent of the company </v>
<v Speaker 1>and now you might be wondering,</v>

215
00:11:38.771 --> 00:11:39.604
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why just 10 percent at the end of the </v>

216
00:11:41.021 --> 00:11:42.130
<v Speaker 1>day?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Back then facebook,</v>

217
00:11:42.131 --> 00:11:44.880
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't worth anything with so much </v>
<v Speaker 1>money invested.</v>

218
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:48.550
<v Speaker 1>Peter Teal could have demanded a bigger </v>
<v Speaker 1>share of the company and to be fair,</v>

219
00:11:48.551 --> 00:11:52.360
<v Speaker 1>that is absolutely true if they were </v>
<v Speaker 1>located somewhere like Alabama.</v>

220
00:11:52.510 --> 00:11:56.060
<v Speaker 1>So they began offering competing good </v>
<v Speaker 1>conditions to the entrepreneur nurse.</v>

221
00:11:56.110 --> 00:11:56.943
<v Speaker 1>So if he asks for too many shares of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>company is knocking bag and sovereign </v>

222
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:02.040
<v Speaker 1>would just have gone to somebody else.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Don't worry there.</v>

223
00:12:02.050 --> 00:12:02.883
<v Speaker 1>Everybody.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Peter Thiel is still extraordinarily </v>

224
00:12:05.171 --> 00:12:05.981
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

225
00:12:05.981 --> 00:12:08.920
<v Speaker 1>so you're probably beginning to </v>
<v Speaker 1>understand why it's a good idea to start</v>

226
00:12:08.921 --> 00:12:09.754
<v Speaker 1>companies yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute because you ain't </v>

227
00:12:11.261 --> 00:12:13.430
<v Speaker 1>seen nothing yet with all million </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

228
00:12:13.550 --> 00:12:16.720
<v Speaker 1>facebook's founders could start building</v>
<v Speaker 1>something big,</v>

229
00:12:16.721 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 1>something that could be sold to the mass</v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

230
00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:21.880
<v Speaker 1>Really,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this is the moment when a company proves</v>

231
00:12:21.881 --> 00:12:22.714
<v Speaker 1>itself successful or not.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The moment when they survive the valley </v>

232
00:12:25.841 --> 00:12:27.430
<v Speaker 1>of death,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while they don't.</v>

233
00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:31.540
<v Speaker 1>If facebook was founded in Alabama,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they would have probably stopped here.</v>

234
00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:35.620
<v Speaker 1>They had a product it worked out and the</v>
<v Speaker 1>money to live on and the story,</v>

235
00:12:35.710 --> 00:12:36.543
<v Speaker 1>but remember this is a startup and it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>goal is to grow as fast as it possibly </v>

236
00:12:40.751 --> 00:12:41.380
<v Speaker 1>can.</v>

237
00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.990
<v Speaker 1>This is where those vc funds came into </v>
<v Speaker 1>the shop.</v>

238
00:12:44.020 --> 00:12:46.450
<v Speaker 1>We're not talking about a Peter Teal guy</v>
<v Speaker 1>with a lot of money here.</v>

239
00:12:46.451 --> 00:12:51.250
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about companies with even </v>
<v Speaker 1>more money and the team of advisors.</v>

240
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.203
<v Speaker 1>This is important because in many cases </v>
<v Speaker 1>vc funders can make vital decisions in </v>

241
00:12:55.781 --> 00:12:56.614
<v Speaker 1>the company and even tell the founders </v>
<v Speaker 1>how they have to design their corporate </v>

242
00:12:59.501 --> 00:13:00.334
<v Speaker 1>structure,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who they can partner with or even how </v>

243
00:13:02.681 --> 00:13:05.020
<v Speaker 1>and when to expand internationally.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

244
00:13:05.021 --> 00:13:07.740
<v Speaker 1>so coming back to our facebook story,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the year 2005,</v>

245
00:13:07.741 --> 00:13:11.770
<v Speaker 1>a vc fund called Excel partners put 12 </v>
<v Speaker 1>point $7,000,000</v>

246
00:13:11.771 --> 00:13:15.070
<v Speaker 1>into facebook with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They owned 13 percent of the company.</v>

247
00:13:20.040 --> 00:13:20.873
<v Speaker 4>As an aside,</v>
<v Speaker 4>if you remember Peter Teal bought 10 </v>

248
00:13:22.861 --> 00:13:23.694
<v Speaker 4>percent of facebook with half a million </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars and the less excel partners </v>

249
00:13:26.941 --> 00:13:31.080
<v Speaker 4>subsequently paid 12 point $7,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 4>for 13 percent of the company.</v>

250
00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:34.020
<v Speaker 4>If you do the math,</v>
<v Speaker 4>you see that from one day to the next,</v>

251
00:13:34.140 --> 00:13:37.860
<v Speaker 4>facebook is now valued at $98 million </v>
<v Speaker 4>dollars.</v>

252
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:38.723
<v Speaker 4>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 4>in just one year Peter teals investment </v>

253
00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:42.690
<v Speaker 4>increased by 2000 percent.</v>

254
00:13:42.810 --> 00:13:43.770
<v Speaker 1>Pretty impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

255
00:13:43.771 --> 00:13:45.530
<v Speaker 1>But again,</v>
<v Speaker 1>hold on because yes,</v>

256
00:13:45.531 --> 00:13:46.364
<v Speaker 1>still haven't seen anything yet.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This ansel partners investment is what </v>

257
00:13:49.201 --> 00:13:52.240
<v Speaker 1>we call a series a investments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And if there's a series a,</v>

258
00:13:52.241 --> 00:13:55.770
<v Speaker 1>it's because later we have a series B,</v>
<v Speaker 1>series c.</v>

259
00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:57.510
<v Speaker 1>alright,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in the case of facebook,</v>

260
00:13:57.511 --> 00:14:02.511
<v Speaker 1>the series c funding was Microsoft.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He paid $240,000,000</v>

261
00:14:03.391 --> 00:14:04.224
<v Speaker 1>in 2007 for this $240,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They were getting just one point six </v>

262
00:14:09.451 --> 00:14:10.284
<v Speaker 1>percent of facebook,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let's return to our maths because </v>

263
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:13.643
<v Speaker 1>it's pretty mind blowing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Facebook is now valued at </v>

264
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.410
<v Speaker 1>$15,000,000,000.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means that that 10 percent,</v>

265
00:14:19.411 --> 00:14:24.411
<v Speaker 1>the Pto ball for half a million dollars </v>
<v Speaker 1>is now worth 300 percent more.</v>

266
00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:28.473
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>

267
00:14:30.450 --> 00:14:32.470
<v Speaker 1>alright.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So this means that if you regular viewer</v>

268
00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:36.210
<v Speaker 1>had invested just a hundred dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>facebook in the year 2004,</v>

269
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:37.163
<v Speaker 1>you'd now have enough money to buy a </v>
<v Speaker 1>waterfront house with a swimming pool </v>

270
00:14:40.140 --> 00:14:42.110
<v Speaker 1>and a mini golf course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

271
00:14:42.111 --> 00:14:44.490
<v Speaker 1>so hold on a moment because at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>point you might be wondering,</v>

272
00:14:44.491 --> 00:14:45.810
<v Speaker 1>well hold on a second.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

273
00:14:45.811 --> 00:14:48.420
<v Speaker 1>was facebook actually worth </v>
<v Speaker 1>$15,000,000,000</v>

274
00:14:48.421 --> 00:14:49.254
<v Speaker 1>at that moment?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Did they really make enough money to </v>

275
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:54.590
<v Speaker 1>that crazy $240,000,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>investments?</v>

276
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.710
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

277
00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:01.310
<v Speaker 1>but you see by investing all that money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you get lots and lots of things,</v>

278
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:05.660
<v Speaker 1>things that sooner or later what ends up</v>
<v Speaker 1>making you a profit and this,</v>

279
00:15:05.690 --> 00:15:08.420
<v Speaker 1>this is when we get to the final stage </v>
<v Speaker 1>of a startup,</v>

280
00:15:08.630 --> 00:15:11.810
<v Speaker 1>but we sell it to a big company or do we</v>
<v Speaker 1>go public?</v>

281
00:15:11.900 --> 00:15:13.910
<v Speaker 1>Facebook?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They decided to enter the stock market,</v>

282
00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:17.630
<v Speaker 1>but many other startups will typically </v>
<v Speaker 1>be sold to big multinational company.</v>

283
00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:24.350
<v Speaker 5>I pull back exam in $400,000,000</v>

284
00:15:24.480 --> 00:15:27.750
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I know what you are going to tell me.</v>

285
00:15:27.751 --> 00:15:29.730
<v Speaker 1>All right Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this sounds really,</v>

286
00:15:29.731 --> 00:15:30.564
<v Speaker 1>really good,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but I just don't believe it's that easy </v>

287
00:15:32.550 --> 00:15:36.960
<v Speaker 1>and why you'd be absolutely Ryan's </v>
<v Speaker 1>because nine out of 10 startups fail,</v>

288
00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:37.853
<v Speaker 1>but importantly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you just need one to succeed to make a </v>

289
00:15:41.101 --> 00:15:43.740
<v Speaker 1>lot of people crazy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>crazy,</v>

290
00:15:43.741 --> 00:15:44.574
<v Speaker 1>rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why the goal of so many </v>

291
00:15:45.781 --> 00:15:49.340
<v Speaker 1>politicians now is to make that own </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley</v>

292
00:15:52.490 --> 00:15:56.190
<v Speaker 5>white Bernadine silicon alley is </v>
<v Speaker 5>Europe's new silicon,</v>

293
00:16:00.730 --> 00:16:02.090
<v Speaker 5>the Mexicans,</v>
<v Speaker 5>silicon</v>

294
00:16:02.190 --> 00:16:03.023
<v Speaker 2>volume</v>

295
00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:07.720
<v Speaker 5>Africa near Silicon Valley's.</v>

296
00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:08.673
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Everybody wants to have their own </v>

297
00:16:09.851 --> 00:16:12.280
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley in their own back yard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

298
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:15.580
<v Speaker 1>everybody except for those people who </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually lived in silicon</v>

299
00:16:18.990 --> 00:16:22.560
<v Speaker 5>lit are abandoning silicon valley in </v>
<v Speaker 5>droves,</v>

300
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.200
<v Speaker 1>but that is something we're going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>actually talk about in our next video.</v>

301
00:16:26.201 --> 00:16:28.270
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the big question is this,</v>

302
00:16:28.271 --> 00:16:32.190
<v Speaker 1>do you think we can replicate the </v>
<v Speaker 1>silicon valley model in other countries?</v>

303
