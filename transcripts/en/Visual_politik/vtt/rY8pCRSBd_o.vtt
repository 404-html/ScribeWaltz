1
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.720
<v Speaker 1>Francis,</v>
<v Speaker 1>probably the only country that makes the</v>

2
00:00:09.721 --> 00:00:10.554
<v Speaker 1>Americans look humble.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ego of the French is so colossal </v>

3
00:00:13.591 --> 00:00:16.530
<v Speaker 1>that it doesn't even fit within its own </v>
<v Speaker 1>country's borders,</v>

4
00:00:16.531 --> 00:00:21.531
<v Speaker 1>which explains why the French spends the</v>
<v Speaker 1>19th century colonizing other countries.</v>

5
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Almost half of Africa was a French </v>
<v Speaker 1>colony as I bet you could probably guess</v>

6
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:26.094
<v Speaker 1>now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The most widely spoken language in </v>

7
00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:28.650
<v Speaker 1>Subsaharan Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

8
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.740
<v Speaker 1>That would be French,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only that,</v>

9
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.060
<v Speaker 1>you will probably heard that Latin </v>
<v Speaker 1>America is the United States,</v>

10
00:00:38.061 --> 00:00:39.860
<v Speaker 1>his back yard rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

11
00:00:39.861 --> 00:00:43.520
<v Speaker 1>we could say the Africa is kind of like </v>
<v Speaker 1>the backyard of the French.</v>

12
00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.940
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2011,</v>

13
00:00:44.941 --> 00:00:47.700
<v Speaker 2>France led every military operation </v>
<v Speaker 2>against Gaddafi.</v>

14
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.953
<v Speaker 2>Francois Salons,</v>
<v Speaker 2>government sent troops to defend the </v>

15
00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:57.990
<v Speaker 2>president of the Central African </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republic.</v>

16
00:00:57.991 --> 00:00:58.824
<v Speaker 2>While at the same time,</v>
<v Speaker 2>French soldiers were also fighting </v>

17
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.510
<v Speaker 2>Islamic terrorists in Mali.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Basically,</v>

18
00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:07.770
<v Speaker 2>the French army has been present in </v>
<v Speaker 2>virtually every African armed conflict</v>

19
00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:08.813
<v Speaker 1>prompts even actually controls the </v>
<v Speaker 1>currency that many African countries </v>

20
00:01:10.981 --> 00:01:12.270
<v Speaker 1>use.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

21
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.860
<v Speaker 1>even though African countries gained </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence from from decades ago,</v>

22
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.550
<v Speaker 1>it still maintains a strong influence on</v>
<v Speaker 1>their governments.</v>

23
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.430
<v Speaker 1>You can call it soft power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can call it diplomacy.</v>

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.860
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you could simply call it colonialism.</v>

25
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.980
<v Speaker 1>Two point nine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and I probably know what many of you are</v>

26
00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:32.460
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>France has got to be getting rich off.</v>

27
00:01:32.461 --> 00:01:33.630
<v Speaker 1>It's two point.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

28
00:01:33.631 --> 00:01:35.610
<v Speaker 1>African colonies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

29
00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.640
<v Speaker 1>Well actually nothing could be further </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the truth.</v>

30
00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:39.543
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

31
00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.910
<v Speaker 2>The last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

32
00:01:43.911 --> 00:01:47.510
<v Speaker 2>trade with Africa has dropped from 10 to</v>
<v Speaker 2>four point seven percent</v>

33
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.723
<v Speaker 1>had that right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even though from dominates African </v>

34
00:01:50.741 --> 00:01:51.574
<v Speaker 1>politics,</v>
<v Speaker 1>its economy is an entirely different </v>

35
00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:55.540
<v Speaker 1>story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

36
00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:56.403
<v Speaker 1>often centuries of colonialism and </v>
<v Speaker 1>neocolonialism African countries have </v>

37
00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.443
<v Speaker 1>barely evolved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hardly any new companies have emerged </v>

38
00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.440
<v Speaker 1>due to French investments and meanwhile </v>
<v Speaker 1>francis spending billions of euros every</v>

39
00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.273
<v Speaker 1>year to maintain its influence over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>continent even though ultimately it </v>

40
00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.550
<v Speaker 1>barely gets any benefit at all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bus.</v>

41
00:02:15.551 --> 00:02:16.384
<v Speaker 1>I,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you can guess who's reaping all of </v>

42
00:02:17.711 --> 00:02:20.740
<v Speaker 1>the benefits from this collaboration </v>
<v Speaker 1>with Africa?</v>

43
00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.030
<v Speaker 1>Yep,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>

44
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.010
<v Speaker 1>We will be talking about China.</v>

45
00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.430
<v Speaker 2>Companies and Africa need each other </v>
<v Speaker 2>like never before.</v>

46
00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:32.463
<v Speaker 1>For the last 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese investment has changed the </v>

47
00:02:35.081 --> 00:02:39.190
<v Speaker 1>skyline of almost all African cities.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Some countries like Ethiopia,</v>

48
00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.200
<v Speaker 1>at becoming industrial powers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially in the textile sac,</v>

49
00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:44.034
<v Speaker 1>sac,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese companies aren't only taking </v>

50
00:02:45.341 --> 00:02:46.174
<v Speaker 1>advantage of the cheap labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they've also found a new market to sell </v>

51
00:02:49.121 --> 00:02:49.954
<v Speaker 1>that product to.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese mobiles are sweeping across </v>

52
00:02:52.331 --> 00:02:55.840
<v Speaker 1>Africa and is more and more people are </v>
<v Speaker 1>learning Chinese.</v>

53
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.570
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while France sends soldiers,</v>

54
00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.673
<v Speaker 1>China sends businessmen and it looks </v>
<v Speaker 1>like it's actually working out pretty </v>

55
00:03:02.411 --> 00:03:04.960
<v Speaker 1>well for them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the question remains,</v>

56
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:09.340
<v Speaker 1>why is France failed to capitalize on </v>
<v Speaker 1>its influence in Africa and what can the</v>

57
00:03:09.341 --> 00:03:13.870
<v Speaker 1>new French President Emmanuel macron do </v>
<v Speaker 1>to improve the situation today?</v>

58
00:03:13.871 --> 00:03:15.460
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to answer this question,</v>

59
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.680
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at the history.</v>

60
00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.090
<v Speaker 2>Disadvantages of paternalism.</v>

61
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.063
<v Speaker 1>Those of you who've been following </v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic for awhile know that </v>

62
00:03:26.231 --> 00:03:29.020
<v Speaker 1>after World War Two,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every African country became independent</v>

63
00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:34.170
<v Speaker 1>from its colonizers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Make no mistake,</v>

64
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.010
<v Speaker 1>not every colonizer behave the same way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

65
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.970
<v Speaker 1>Spain had two colonies in Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sahara and Equatorial Guinea.</v>

66
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.420
<v Speaker 1>So when these new countries decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>become independent,</v>

67
00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.130
<v Speaker 1>the Spanish government's reaction was </v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much weight.</v>

68
00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.023
<v Speaker 1>We have colonies in Africa and then they</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty much just let them go because </v>

69
00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:56.040
<v Speaker 1>they had enough to worry about back </v>
<v Speaker 1>home.</v>

70
00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.913
<v Speaker 1>Something similar happens with they </v>
<v Speaker 1>invaded Ethiopia during miscellaneous </v>

71
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.410
<v Speaker 1>time and weren't in a position to resist</v>
<v Speaker 1>any decolonization.</v>

72
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.160
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>from sue was very different,</v>

73
00:04:10.161 --> 00:04:12.740
<v Speaker 1>so at that time the French president was</v>
<v Speaker 1>this guy,</v>

74
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.633
<v Speaker 1>Charles,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to goal to goal was how can we define </v>

75
00:04:16.281 --> 00:04:17.720
<v Speaker 1>it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was kind of Donald Trump,</v>

76
00:04:17.721 --> 00:04:20.000
<v Speaker 1>but a little bit more politically smart.</v>

77
00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.830
<v Speaker 2>CanNot Be France without its greatness.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Charleston</v>

78
00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:27.763
<v Speaker 3>cool.</v>

79
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:29.853
<v Speaker 1>Now on the one hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Charles de Gaulle had pretty much no </v>

80
00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:35.380
<v Speaker 1>choice but to allow its African colonies</v>
<v Speaker 1>to become independence.</v>

81
00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.393
<v Speaker 1>Maintaining colonies is really expensive</v>
<v Speaker 1>and from Santa focus on rebuilding </v>

82
00:04:39.731 --> 00:04:41.230
<v Speaker 1>itself,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as you can imagine,</v>

83
00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:44.440
<v Speaker 1>a government with so much ego wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to give up.</v>

84
00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.730
<v Speaker 1>It's old possessions from skeptics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ami in all of its former colonies.</v>

85
00:04:48.731 --> 00:04:53.731
<v Speaker 1>Sands from the Elysee Palace decided to </v>
<v Speaker 1>support everyone of the political elites</v>

86
00:04:54.731 --> 00:04:57.640
<v Speaker 1>that had begun governing these new </v>
<v Speaker 1>African countries.</v>

87
00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1964,</v>

88
00:05:04.291 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>the French army,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's supported acu in Gabon.</v>

89
00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.300
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the country was governed by Oma bongos.</v>

90
00:05:09.301 --> 00:05:10.134
<v Speaker 1>Dictatorship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For more than 40 years and you supplied </v>

91
00:05:12.841 --> 00:05:13.674
<v Speaker 1>all the weapons,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well of course it would be France and </v>

92
00:05:15.601 --> 00:05:16.434
<v Speaker 1>resigned and gambling and follows French</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign policy to the and is its main </v>

93
00:05:20.341 --> 00:05:22.080
<v Speaker 1>uranium supplier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you probably know,</v>

94
00:05:22.081 --> 00:05:22.914
<v Speaker 1>France is one of the countries with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most nuclear power plants in the whole </v>

95
00:05:25.441 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 1>world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

96
00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:27.293
<v Speaker 1>the Uranian they use it comes almost </v>
<v Speaker 1>entirely from gambling and of course </v>

97
00:05:31.291 --> 00:05:33.270
<v Speaker 1>they get it at a favorable price.</v>

98
00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:38.090
<v Speaker 2>Gabon was out.</v>
<v Speaker 2>France is like a car without a driver.</v>

99
00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:41.540
<v Speaker 2>France without Gabon is like a car with </v>
<v Speaker 2>no fuel,</v>

100
00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.930
<v Speaker 2>well more Bunco,</v>
<v Speaker 2>president of Gabon for 42 years</v>

101
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.893
<v Speaker 1>and the same goes for other countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>such as the Ivory Coast who's president </v>

102
00:05:48.721 --> 00:05:49.554
<v Speaker 1>was also placed by France in 2011.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The previous presidents left the palace </v>

103
00:05:53.341 --> 00:05:54.174
<v Speaker 1>under cannon shots and guests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He was pulling the trigger of those </v>

104
00:05:56.611 --> 00:05:57.500
<v Speaker 1>canons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

105
00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:58.393
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be French soldiers and </v>

106
00:05:59.391 --> 00:06:00.224
<v Speaker 1>resigned.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Ivory Coast is Francis made coffee </v>

107
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.163
<v Speaker 1>and cocoa supplier.</v>
<v Speaker 1>French influence in the region is so </v>

108
00:06:05.211 --> 00:06:06.044
<v Speaker 1>complete.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's even the currency they use is </v>

109
00:06:07.611 --> 00:06:08.810
<v Speaker 1>controlled by froms,</v>

110
00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.713
<v Speaker 2>so called CFA franc is the currency </v>
<v Speaker 2>being used in 15 of west African </v>

111
00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800
<v Speaker 2>countries such as Mali,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast,</v>

112
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:24.780
<v Speaker 2>and it turns out that the central bank </v>
<v Speaker 2>that issues this currency is required to</v>

113
00:06:24.781 --> 00:06:28.320
<v Speaker 2>keep at least half of its foreign </v>
<v Speaker 2>currency reserves in the French treasury</v>

114
00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:29.533
<v Speaker 2>and since its creation,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CFA franc has been linked to the </v>

115
00:06:31.591 --> 00:06:32.424
<v Speaker 2>French currency.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He used to be the French franc and now </v>

116
00:06:34.051 --> 00:06:34.884
<v Speaker 2>it's the euro.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that when the euro rises or </v>

117
00:06:36.451 --> 00:06:38.640
<v Speaker 2>falls,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the CFA franc follow.</v>

118
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.173
<v Speaker 1>Wait a moment because there's some fine </v>
<v Speaker 1>print here and now find brands is the </v>

119
00:06:45.931 --> 00:06:47.580
<v Speaker 1>productive economy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

120
00:06:47.581 --> 00:06:48.414
<v Speaker 1>France has been running,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's former colonies policies for </v>

121
00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:51.294
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but these countries have remained just </v>

122
00:06:53.241 --> 00:06:56.820
<v Speaker 1>as poor as when they were independence </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the exception of the Ivory Coast.</v>

123
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:57.683
<v Speaker 1>The French influenced countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa tend to have underdeveloped </v>

124
00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:03.120
<v Speaker 1>agricultural and virtually stagnant </v>
<v Speaker 1>economies.</v>

125
00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.073
<v Speaker 1>No French company has bothered to open </v>
<v Speaker 1>factories in Africa and the money that </v>

126
00:07:06.991 --> 00:07:07.824
<v Speaker 1>came from the Elisa was invested in </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons or extracting natural resources </v>

127
00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:14.580
<v Speaker 1>after all who wants to do business in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Africa?</v>

128
00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.623
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you probably already know the answer to </v>

129
00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:19.810
<v Speaker 1>that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China,</v>

130
00:07:19.830 --> 00:07:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we've told you a thousand times.</v>

131
00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:22.840
<v Speaker 1>Aaron Fisher,</v>
<v Speaker 1>politic.</v>

132
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:23.733
<v Speaker 1>China is Africa's main trading.</v>
<v Speaker 1>These China grew economically like </v>

133
00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:35.120
<v Speaker 1>there's no tomorrow and when one starts </v>
<v Speaker 1>grabbing one needs resources.</v>

134
00:07:35.180 --> 00:07:36.013
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing new because unlike France or </v>

135
00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:38.323
<v Speaker 1>many other Western power,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China realize that Africa was more than </v>

136
00:07:41.151 --> 00:07:43.220
<v Speaker 1>mines and oil fields.</v>

137
00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:47.550
<v Speaker 4>I believe Africa is going to become the </v>
<v Speaker 4>next manufacturer.</v>

138
00:07:47.551 --> 00:07:48.384
<v Speaker 4>Flow,</v>
<v Speaker 4>photo work and poverty will not be a </v>

139
00:07:51.181 --> 00:07:55.980
<v Speaker 4>destiny and millions of people you </v>
<v Speaker 4>Africa will escape poverty.</v>

140
00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.120
<v Speaker 4>Thank you all.</v>

141
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:03.710
<v Speaker 1>The woman you just heard is Helen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

142
00:08:03.711 --> 00:08:04.544
<v Speaker 1>And she's a Chinese businesswoman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That company is Gian and it makes shoes </v>

143
00:08:08.211 --> 00:08:11.180
<v Speaker 1>for big brands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you have gas or Calvin Klein shoes,</v>

144
00:08:11.181 --> 00:08:12.014
<v Speaker 1>it's very likely that they were made by </v>
<v Speaker 1>this company and I bet you can't guess </v>

145
00:08:14.691 --> 00:08:16.520
<v Speaker 1>where it's biggest factor is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

146
00:08:16.521 --> 00:08:19.340
<v Speaker 1>it's actually located not in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but in Addis Ababa.</v>

147
00:08:19.430 --> 00:08:20.540
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia is capital.</v>

148
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.240
<v Speaker 3>Let me</v>

149
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.740
<v Speaker 1>think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the nineties,</v>

150
00:08:26.741 --> 00:08:27.574
<v Speaker 1>China was the Mecca of cheap labor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>every large American or European </v>

151
00:08:30.761 --> 00:08:31.594
<v Speaker 1>company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which that of its factories in cities </v>

152
00:08:32.981 --> 00:08:34.950
<v Speaker 1>such as Shenzhen or Guangzhou,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so,</v>

153
00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.660
<v Speaker 1>but as the country grew salaries group </v>
<v Speaker 1>two,</v>

154
00:08:37.740 --> 00:08:39.700
<v Speaker 1>and it's by the year 2011,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

155
00:08:39.701 --> 00:08:41.980
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Realized that if she wanted to cut costs</v>

156
00:08:41.981 --> 00:08:42.814
<v Speaker 1>in terms of salaries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she needed to find another country and </v>

157
00:08:45.401 --> 00:08:48.060
<v Speaker 1>that country was Ethiopia once more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Helen,</v>

158
00:08:48.080 --> 00:08:49.510
<v Speaker 1>hi.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Wasn't traveling alone.</v>

159
00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:50.463
<v Speaker 1>She had the Chinese government support </v>
<v Speaker 1>which address the Ethiopian political </v>

160
00:08:53.411 --> 00:08:55.120
<v Speaker 1>elites and told them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>look guys,</v>

161
00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:59.700
<v Speaker 1>if you just let us do things our way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we can cover the country with factories,</v>

162
00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.380
<v Speaker 1>with money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs,</v>

163
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.440
<v Speaker 1>and as we often say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>visual politic as it will said.</v>

164
00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:05.370
<v Speaker 1>So it was done.</v>

165
00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:11.703
<v Speaker 1>Industrial Park is already operational </v>
<v Speaker 1>and Ethiopia wants it to become a </v>

166
00:09:14.851 --> 00:09:15.684
<v Speaker 1>manufacturing hub,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're not just talking about </v>

167
00:09:17.521 --> 00:09:18.354
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia here.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are Chinese factories in many </v>

168
00:09:20.251 --> 00:09:21.084
<v Speaker 1>other countries twice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is a company that manufactures </v>

169
00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:27.300
<v Speaker 1>ceramic tiles and it's main plant is on </v>
<v Speaker 1>the outskirts of Nairobi in Kenya,</v>

170
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:31.510
<v Speaker 1>and we can also find new industrial </v>
<v Speaker 1>parks and other countries like Ghana.</v>

171
00:09:31.830 --> 00:09:34.620
<v Speaker 1>Even though Chinese companies are </v>
<v Speaker 1>supported by the governments,</v>

172
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:35.573
<v Speaker 1>we're mostly talking about private </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments here and I probably can </v>

173
00:09:38.491 --> 00:09:39.324
<v Speaker 1>guess what you're thinking right now </v>
<v Speaker 1>that these companies are making cheap </v>

174
00:09:41.821 --> 00:09:44.400
<v Speaker 1>things so they can sell them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So rich countries,</v>

175
00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:46.950
<v Speaker 1>Rice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well actually not really.</v>

176
00:09:47.160 --> 00:09:50.220
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Star Times is a company in Tanzania made</v>

177
00:09:50.221 --> 00:09:51.054
<v Speaker 1>with Chinese capital and it provides </v>
<v Speaker 1>cable television since they reached the </v>

178
00:09:53.401 --> 00:09:55.590
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Cable TV prices have dropped by 95.</v>

179
00:09:57.990 --> 00:09:58.340
<v Speaker 3>Thanks.</v>

180
00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.620
<v Speaker 1>That more than $10 million Africans can </v>
<v Speaker 1>enjoy a service.</v>

181
00:10:01.621 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 1>That was a luxury and the same is going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on with telecom.</v>

182
00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.370
<v Speaker 1>Companies like Huawei have flooded the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market with cheap mobile phones.</v>

183
00:10:08.430 --> 00:10:09.263
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nowadays the same amount of Kenyans use </v>

184
00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:15.330
<v Speaker 1>mobile phones as Europeans and of course</v>
<v Speaker 1>to connect all these industrial centers,</v>

185
00:10:15.331 --> 00:10:18.450
<v Speaker 1>the Chinese government has spared no </v>
<v Speaker 1>expense.</v>

186
00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.373
<v Speaker 1>Do you?</v>
<v Speaker 1>To the new Silk Road we talked about </v>

187
00:10:20.461 --> 00:10:22.260
<v Speaker 1>previously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the so called one belt,</v>

188
00:10:22.261 --> 00:10:24.510
<v Speaker 1>one road project that Xi Jinping </v>
<v Speaker 1>launched.</v>

189
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:25.403
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the same thing is happening in Africa </v>

190
00:10:26.701 --> 00:10:27.534
<v Speaker 1>and we're talking about thousands of </v>
<v Speaker 1>kilometers of railroads and roads that </v>

191
00:10:31.051 --> 00:10:34.590
<v Speaker 1>have changed the landscape of several </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas of the continent.</v>

192
00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.280
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unlike France,</v>

193
00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:46.840
<v Speaker 1>China hasn't tried to colonize Africa,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but instead has turns them into business</v>

194
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.693
<v Speaker 1>partners and thanks to that they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>managed and more money and more </v>

195
00:10:50.831 --> 00:10:51.664
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Fucious institutes are raising </v>

196
00:10:56.691 --> 00:10:57.524
<v Speaker 1>generations of pro Chinese mandarin </v>
<v Speaker 1>speakers throughout Africa and now </v>

197
00:11:01.101 --> 00:11:02.360
<v Speaker 1>you're wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

198
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.253
<v Speaker 1>what conference do about this?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Are they just going to sit by while </v>

199
00:11:05.511 --> 00:11:07.640
<v Speaker 1>China and gulfs the market?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

200
00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.563
<v Speaker 1>we'll see common interests.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It probably won't surprise you to learn </v>

201
00:11:13.751 --> 00:11:14.584
<v Speaker 1>that a large number of African countries</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't exactly legal safety paradises </v>

202
00:11:17.860 --> 00:11:18.693
<v Speaker 1>that have a lot of respect for the law.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're often talking about dictatorships </v>

203
00:11:21.761 --> 00:11:22.780
<v Speaker 1>out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Others,</v>

204
00:11:22.810 --> 00:11:23.643
<v Speaker 1>I'll simply failed states that can </v>
<v Speaker 1>barely contain the fights of various </v>

205
00:11:26.651 --> 00:11:27.484
<v Speaker 1>tribes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means setting up a factory in a </v>

206
00:11:29.681 --> 00:11:32.560
<v Speaker 1>country like Gavin is much more </v>
<v Speaker 1>complicated than setting one up.</v>

207
00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:34.600
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in a place like the United States,</v>

208
00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:39.130
<v Speaker 3>it isn't</v>

209
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:43.150
<v Speaker 1>enough to buy land and get a permit.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You need to have government contracts.</v>

210
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:47.410
<v Speaker 1>That means in these cases,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomacy plays a fundamental role.</v>

211
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:50.680
<v Speaker 1>Or in the how I told you that froms </v>
<v Speaker 1>controls its former colonies governments</v>

212
00:11:50.681 --> 00:11:51.970
<v Speaker 1>with an iron fist.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

213
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.800
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine the rest of the story.</v>

214
00:11:53.830 --> 00:11:54.663
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

215
00:11:57.580 --> 00:11:58.413
<v Speaker 2>French companies must go on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>offensive and fight to the growing </v>

216
00:12:00.701 --> 00:12:01.534
<v Speaker 2>influence of rival China for a stake in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Africa's increasingly competitive </v>

217
00:12:04.931 --> 00:12:06.190
<v Speaker 2>markets.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>

218
00:12:06.191 --> 00:12:08.710
<v Speaker 2>minister pro Muscovy chief said on </v>
<v Speaker 2>Saturday,</v>

219
00:12:08.990 --> 00:12:09.823
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if France doesn't want China to invest </v>

220
00:12:11.421 --> 00:12:12.254
<v Speaker 1>in its former colonies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has enough tools to prevent it and </v>

221
00:12:14.721 --> 00:12:17.900
<v Speaker 1>that's why Chinese money has banny </v>
<v Speaker 1>reached these countries.</v>

222
00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:18.883
<v Speaker 1>Of course Beijing has paid for some </v>
<v Speaker 1>projects in countries like the Ivory </v>

223
00:12:21.530 --> 00:12:22.363
<v Speaker 1>Coast and Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and there's little in comparison to </v>

224
00:12:24.471 --> 00:12:26.470
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia or Kenya.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

225
00:12:26.570 --> 00:12:29.570
<v Speaker 1>things could start to change.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The new French President Emmanuel Macron</v>

226
00:12:29.750 --> 00:12:30.583
<v Speaker 1>has promised to turn the African </v>
<v Speaker 1>situation around and it looks like it's </v>

227
00:12:33.741 --> 00:12:34.574
<v Speaker 1>already started.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Revives Francis Partnership with China </v>

228
00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:42.150
<v Speaker 1>in Africa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As mccrone said at the press conference,</v>

229
00:12:42.180 --> 00:12:45.510
<v Speaker 1>China has the money and we have the </v>
<v Speaker 1>knowledge of the region.</v>

230
00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:46.463
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>France would be willing to allow the </v>

231
00:12:48.151 --> 00:12:48.984
<v Speaker 1>African politicians they control except </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese investments in return that </v>

232
00:12:52.801 --> 00:12:54.810
<v Speaker 1>require a piece of the pie.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

233
00:12:54.811 --> 00:12:55.644
<v Speaker 1>this news is from January 2018,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so there's still a lot to do before we </v>

234
00:12:59.221 --> 00:13:01.140
<v Speaker 1>can see how this agreement turns out.</v>

235
00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:07.663
