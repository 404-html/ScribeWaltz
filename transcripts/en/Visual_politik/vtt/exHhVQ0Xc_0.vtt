<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.460
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood's it's the world's most famous</v>
<v Speaker 2>neighborhoods spans.</v>

3
00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:11.241
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I said that.</v>

4
00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:13.730
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood is a neighborhood.</v>

5
00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.890
<v Speaker 2>It's not a city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's not even a village.</v>

6
00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.600
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood is a district inside the city </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Los Angeles with a population of less</v>

7
00:00:20.601 --> 00:00:21.920
<v Speaker 2>than 90,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>people.</v>

8
00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.950
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>here is where most of the movie industry</v>

9
00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:25.784
<v Speaker 2>has concentrated.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Wait just a minute because I know what </v>

10
00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.560
<v Speaker 2>you're going to say.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Come on.</v>

11
00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.090
<v Speaker 2>Signer,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and I know better than this.</v>

12
00:00:33.091 --> 00:00:35.920
<v Speaker 2>This isn't a tall tree.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The biggest movie production centered.</v>

13
00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.740
<v Speaker 2>The world is Bollywood in India.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well my dear viewers,</v>

14
00:00:38.741 --> 00:00:42.210
<v Speaker 2>you up sort of right here,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but there is a pretty significant,</v>

15
00:00:42.211 --> 00:00:43.044
<v Speaker 2>but now despite the fact that the Indian</v>
<v Speaker 2>movie industry makes more movies than </v>

16
00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.190
<v Speaker 2>anyone of their income is tiny compared </v>
<v Speaker 2>to that of Hollywood,</v>

17
00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.550
<v Speaker 2>I think just think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>How many Indian movies have you actually</v>

18
00:00:56.551 --> 00:00:57.384
<v Speaker 2>seen?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I bet the answer to that is number or </v>

19
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.200
<v Speaker 2>lost and undone less.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course your Indian,</v>

20
00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:02.160
<v Speaker 2>in which case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello,</v>

21
00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:04.830
<v Speaker 2>dear Indian viewers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now with a few exceptions,</v>

22
00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:05.723
<v Speaker 2>Bollywood movies are made to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>domestic market and the same goes for </v>

23
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:10.194
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigeria is actually the second largest </v>

24
00:01:12.481 --> 00:01:14.790
<v Speaker 2>movie producer in the world behind </v>
<v Speaker 2>Bollywood.</v>

25
00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.773
<v Speaker 2>But I'm sure hardly any of you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>actually seen a film made in this </v>

26
00:01:18.541 --> 00:01:20.860
<v Speaker 2>country and you are of course in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Nigerian,</v>

27
00:01:20.861 --> 00:01:22.920
<v Speaker 2>in which case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>hello Nigerian viewers.</v>

28
00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.530
<v Speaker 2>So when it comes to the raw economics of</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all,</v>

29
00:01:25.531 --> 00:01:28.530
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood is undoubtedly the world's </v>
<v Speaker 2>movie capitol.</v>

30
00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.120
<v Speaker 2>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

31
00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.520
<v Speaker 2>Simon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we talking about cinema here?</v>

32
00:01:32.521 --> 00:01:33.354
<v Speaker 2>A visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Isn't this channel all about politics </v>

33
00:01:35.161 --> 00:01:36.360
<v Speaker 2>and economics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

34
00:01:36.361 --> 00:01:38.250
<v Speaker 2>what's the connection here?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

35
00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.500
<v Speaker 2>actually there are a lot of connection.</v>

36
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.630
<v Speaker 2>First there is the fact that there is a </v>
<v Speaker 2>political reason why he's so much of the</v>

37
00:01:50.631 --> 00:01:53.210
<v Speaker 2>movie world is centered in Hollywood and</v>
<v Speaker 2>the end of the day,</v>

38
00:01:53.211 --> 00:01:54.044
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why as Hollywood in Los Angeles and not </v>

39
00:01:55.941 --> 00:01:59.120
<v Speaker 2>in New York or London or somewhere else </v>
<v Speaker 2>entirely.</v>

40
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.013
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of you might think that California </v>

41
00:02:01.101 --> 00:02:05.840
<v Speaker 2>has always been an important state in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the u s with innovative companies,</v>

42
00:02:05.841 --> 00:02:09.560
<v Speaker 2>prestigious universities and celebrities</v>
<v Speaker 2>just walking down the street.</v>

43
00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:12.320
<v Speaker 2>But the truth is that at the beginning </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the 20th century,</v>

44
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:15.620
<v Speaker 2>La had less of an 100,000</v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants.</v>

45
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:16.573
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first movie producers were born on </v>

46
00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:21.860
<v Speaker 2>the other side of the country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then cities like New York or Chicago.</v>

47
00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:24.620
<v Speaker 2>So the question we have to ask now is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

48
00:02:24.621 --> 00:02:25.454
<v Speaker 2>why did they decide to move to la?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What does Hollywood have the Manhattan </v>

49
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.190
<v Speaker 2>doesn't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>And the most important question of all,</v>

50
00:02:31.191 --> 00:02:33.620
<v Speaker 2>what does immigration have to do with </v>
<v Speaker 2>any of this?</v>

51
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.770
<v Speaker 2>Well today we are going to answer all of</v>
<v Speaker 2>those questions,</v>

52
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:37.604
<v Speaker 2>but before we do as usual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's take a look at the history art by </v>

53
00:02:45.621 --> 00:02:47.990
<v Speaker 2>and for immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The first question of all when it has to</v>

54
00:02:47.991 --> 00:02:50.030
<v Speaker 2>be who invented movies in the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>place?</v>

55
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.190
<v Speaker 2>The Lumiere brothers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

56
00:02:52.191 --> 00:02:56.570
<v Speaker 2>not exactly what the Lumiere brothers </v>
<v Speaker 2>invented was the system to project films</v>

57
00:02:56.571 --> 00:02:57.404
<v Speaker 2>onto a big screen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But years before that the company of </v>

58
00:03:00.041 --> 00:03:00.874
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Edison had already discovered a </v>
<v Speaker 2>system to record and play short movies </v>

59
00:03:05.081 --> 00:03:05.914
<v Speaker 2>and this was called a kinetoscope.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It was a device where you would put a </v>

60
00:03:08.711 --> 00:03:11.980
<v Speaker 2>coin into a slot and watch movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>through AP poll.</v>

61
00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:15.513
<v Speaker 2>He is later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This system would be improved so that </v>

62
00:03:17.561 --> 00:03:20.980
<v Speaker 2>these short films could be projected </v>
<v Speaker 2>onto a big screen as well.</v>

63
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.963
<v Speaker 2>But the big difference between Edison </v>
<v Speaker 2>and the Lumiere brothers was that the </v>

64
00:03:24.851 --> 00:03:29.260
<v Speaker 2>American businessmen knew that these </v>
<v Speaker 2>could make big time money.</v>

65
00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.410
<v Speaker 3>Anything that won't sell,</v>
<v Speaker 3>I don't want to invent it.</v>

66
00:03:34.411 --> 00:03:39.170
<v Speaker 3>Sale is proof of utility and utility is </v>
<v Speaker 3>success.</v>

67
00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.090
<v Speaker 3>Thomas Alva Edison,</v>

68
00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.670
<v Speaker 2>so while the Lumiere brothers showed off</v>
<v Speaker 2>their invention at scientific fairs,</v>

69
00:03:44.671 --> 00:03:45.504
<v Speaker 2>Edison made a profit from it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>His business consisted of selling these </v>

70
00:03:48.601 --> 00:03:49.434
<v Speaker 2>machines,</v>
<v Speaker 2>taking a royalty for their use and </v>

71
00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:53.700
<v Speaker 2>supplying movie theaters with lots and </v>
<v Speaker 2>lots of films.</v>

72
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.200
<v Speaker 2>It just two decades,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edison made more than 1,200</v>

73
00:03:58.201 --> 00:03:59.820
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like now you might be wondering,</v>

74
00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:02.940
<v Speaker 2>what kind of movies did Edison produce?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

75
00:04:02.941 --> 00:04:03.774
<v Speaker 2>as bizarre,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more not as it possibly sounds as many </v>

76
00:04:05.821 --> 00:04:09.510
<v Speaker 2>of these first films in history were </v>
<v Speaker 2>about women getting undressed,</v>

77
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.540
<v Speaker 2>but movies were bigger opportunity and </v>
<v Speaker 2>just a few years,</v>

78
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.980
<v Speaker 2>cities like New York and Chicago became </v>
<v Speaker 2>flooded with movie theaters.</v>

79
00:04:16.981 --> 00:04:17.814
<v Speaker 2>The so called Nickelodeon's.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Here you find a great show at a lower </v>

80
00:04:22.141 --> 00:04:23.850
<v Speaker 2>price in another theaters.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Plus,</v>

81
00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:24.713
<v Speaker 2>since the movies were silent,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you didn't need to speak English to </v>

82
00:04:27.481 --> 00:04:28.314
<v Speaker 2>understand them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means movies became the perfect </v>

83
00:04:30.001 --> 00:04:33.600
<v Speaker 2>entertainments for all the immigrants </v>
<v Speaker 2>arriving to the lands of opportunity.</v>

84
00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:34.493
<v Speaker 2>All of this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was happening in the first decade of </v>

85
00:04:35.611 --> 00:04:38.490
<v Speaker 2>the 20th century men's while France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>since interestingly,</v>

86
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.130
<v Speaker 2>Denmark already were producing that own </v>
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>

87
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:44.340
<v Speaker 2>No other country had a bigger audience </v>
<v Speaker 2>than America.</v>

88
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:48.213
<v Speaker 2>How is that Thomas Edison?</v>
<v Speaker 2>He wasn't able to see all of the </v>

89
00:04:50.101 --> 00:04:52.950
<v Speaker 2>opportunities behind his invention.</v>
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>

90
00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:56.220
<v Speaker 2>he was the typical wasp and d despised </v>
<v Speaker 2>immigrants.</v>

91
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:58.530
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was happy to be money from them,</v>

92
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:01.140
<v Speaker 2>but he didn't really like them and so </v>
<v Speaker 2>now you might be asking,</v>

93
00:05:01.141 --> 00:05:03.090
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why didn't he invests money in improving</v>

94
00:05:03.091 --> 00:05:04.560
<v Speaker 2>the quality of his films?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

95
00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:05.423
<v Speaker 2>at the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>his company had a monopoly over the </v>

96
00:05:06.811 --> 00:05:08.730
<v Speaker 2>production and distribution of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>films.</v>

97
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.810
<v Speaker 2>It's like he really didn't have any </v>
<v Speaker 2>incentive to</v>

98
00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:15.230
<v Speaker 3>all those nickelodeon's paid royalties </v>
<v Speaker 3>to Edison's company and bought his films</v>

99
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:17.630
<v Speaker 3>without even looking at the titles are </v>
<v Speaker 3>plots.</v>

100
00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.180
<v Speaker 3>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 3>nobody thought those German,</v>

101
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:23.560
<v Speaker 3>Italian or Hungarian immigrants would </v>
<v Speaker 3>appreciate the details.</v>

102
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:29.593
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this was until this man you see on the </v>

103
00:05:31.311 --> 00:05:32.144
<v Speaker 2>screen right now came along.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course I'm talking about call Lemley </v>

104
00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.490
<v Speaker 2>Emily.</v>
<v Speaker 2>He was one of these German immigrants.</v>

105
00:05:42.491 --> 00:05:45.400
<v Speaker 2>He worked at a nickelodeon in Chicago </v>
<v Speaker 2>business.</v>

106
00:05:45.401 --> 00:05:46.234
<v Speaker 2>It was great,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but he was sick of paying so much money </v>

107
00:05:47.831 --> 00:05:51.160
<v Speaker 2>if they that a sense movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So he asked himself the question wrong,</v>

108
00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:53.560
<v Speaker 2>can just,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I make my own movies and as well,</v>

109
00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:55.060
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he absolutely could.</v>

110
00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:59.750
<v Speaker 2>I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'll say Lenley.</v>

111
00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 2>He knew other nickelodeon owners.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of them were immigrants too,</v>

112
00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.720
<v Speaker 2>as they knew the tastes and aspirations </v>
<v Speaker 2>of their audiences.</v>

113
00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.703
<v Speaker 2>They knew that movies,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they could become something much more </v>

114
00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:12.810
<v Speaker 2>than just cheap jokes and girls with not</v>
<v Speaker 2>very many clothes.</v>

115
00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.260
<v Speaker 2>They could create stars like those seen </v>
<v Speaker 2>on Broadway.</v>

116
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.093
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

117
00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:23.113
<v Speaker 2>These cinema pioneers were the first </v>
<v Speaker 2>ones to include the actor's name on the </v>

118
00:06:26.361 --> 00:06:27.194
<v Speaker 2>posters and in the credits this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many more artists were willing to work </v>

119
00:06:30.651 --> 00:06:31.484
<v Speaker 2>for them.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their films became famous among </v>

120
00:06:33.020 --> 00:06:35.660
<v Speaker 2>immigrants who came.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They came from all over the worlds,</v>

121
00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.130
<v Speaker 2>and this is why they named their company</v>
<v Speaker 2>universal.</v>

122
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:42.723
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

123
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.330
<v Speaker 2>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the success of this new company,</v>

124
00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.550
<v Speaker 2>they didn't spot others to follow suit,</v>
<v Speaker 2>for instance,</v>

125
00:06:47.551 --> 00:06:49.550
<v Speaker 2>and other Hungarian immigrants named </v>
<v Speaker 2>adults.</v>

126
00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 2>Zucker made another partnership with </v>
<v Speaker 2>other nickelodeon owners.</v>

127
00:06:53.031 --> 00:06:56.670
<v Speaker 2>Zahn started another studio,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which was called paramount pictures,</v>

128
00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.890
<v Speaker 2>southernly New York,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and in general,</v>

129
00:06:58.891 --> 00:07:01.950
<v Speaker 2>the east coast became sort of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>primitive version of Hollywood.</v>

130
00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.800
<v Speaker 2>The hold on for just a minute because </v>
<v Speaker 2>Thomas Edison,</v>

131
00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:12.110
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he was not willing to lose this battle.</v>

132
00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:14.090
<v Speaker 2>Don't forget,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he had the fame,</v>

133
00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:15.320
<v Speaker 2>the money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>am's,</v>

134
00:07:15.321 --> 00:07:18.110
<v Speaker 2>the patterns.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So in less than five years,</v>

135
00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.710
<v Speaker 2>Lemley and his partner's feast over 200 </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawsuits.</v>

136
00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:24.980
<v Speaker 2>The same happens with the rest of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>small studios and as well,</v>

137
00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:30.040
<v Speaker 2>many of them went bankrupt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yeah.</v>

138
00:07:31.561 --> 00:07:34.340
<v Speaker 2>This was a pretty bad side.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The movie studios is bad.</v>

139
00:07:34.341 --> 00:07:36.690
<v Speaker 2>It was pretty much a golden era for </v>
<v Speaker 2>lawyers,</v>

140
00:07:42.330 --> 00:07:43.163
<v Speaker 2>and if all of this was not enough,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Edison had enough power to force all of </v>

141
00:07:46.351 --> 00:07:50.820
<v Speaker 2>the nickelodeons from New York and </v>
<v Speaker 2>Chicago to sign exclusivity contracts.</v>

142
00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.900
<v Speaker 2>If they wanted Addison's technology,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it couldn't buy movies from his rivals.</v>

143
00:07:57.420 --> 00:07:58.253
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the moment when our friend </v>

144
00:07:58.951 --> 00:07:59.784
<v Speaker 2>called Lemley,</v>
<v Speaker 2>asked himself another important </v>

145
00:08:01.681 --> 00:08:02.580
<v Speaker 2>question,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

146
00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.870
<v Speaker 2>why should they stay on the east coast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Addison,</v>

147
00:08:04.950 --> 00:08:05.783
<v Speaker 2>he was a powerful man in ds,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it's influence didn't reach </v>

148
00:08:08.281 --> 00:08:09.114
<v Speaker 2>everywhere.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There was a place far out of his reach </v>

149
00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:13.410
<v Speaker 2>and that place it was California</v>

150
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:17.820
<v Speaker 2>birth of an industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the end,</v>

151
00:08:17.821 --> 00:08:18.654
<v Speaker 2>90 15 California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there was the place to be thousands of </v>

152
00:08:21.311 --> 00:08:22.144
<v Speaker 2>young immigrants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The perfect audience for these would </v>

153
00:08:23.891 --> 00:08:24.724
<v Speaker 2>arrive every year.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Houses and properties were cheaper than </v>

154
00:08:27.161 --> 00:08:30.130
<v Speaker 2>anywhere else in America.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as if this was not enough,</v>

155
00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:32.560
<v Speaker 2>if the weather was pretty fantastic in </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York,</v>

156
00:08:32.561 --> 00:08:34.990
<v Speaker 2>it rains a ray of the day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you wanted to make movies,</v>

157
00:08:34.991 --> 00:08:38.080
<v Speaker 2>you'd better have a studio and spend </v>
<v Speaker 2>thousands of dollars on lights.</v>

158
00:08:38.230 --> 00:08:39.063
<v Speaker 2>In California,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there's plenty of sunshine all year </v>

159
00:08:40.301 --> 00:08:42.630
<v Speaker 2>round,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so it's really easy to shoot outside.</v>

160
00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.113
<v Speaker 2>This is why all those big studios from </v>
<v Speaker 2>New York and Chicago moved into a </v>

161
00:08:52.021 --> 00:08:54.420
<v Speaker 2>neighborhood on the outskirts of Los </v>
<v Speaker 2>Angeles,</v>

162
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.690
<v Speaker 2>a small with less or more than 500 </v>
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants.</v>

163
00:08:57.930 --> 00:09:01.290
<v Speaker 2>And as you've probably guessed by now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that tiny place,</v>

164
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:02.220
<v Speaker 2>it was Hollywood,</v>

165
00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.630
<v Speaker 2>but the story,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it doesn't end here.</v>

166
00:09:07.900 --> 00:09:09.130
<v Speaker 2>You might now be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

167
00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:12.490
<v Speaker 2>how did California conquer audiences all</v>
<v Speaker 2>around the world?</v>

168
00:09:12.610 --> 00:09:13.443
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>don't forget that back in the day that </v>

169
00:09:14.231 --> 00:09:15.064
<v Speaker 2>United States,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it wasn't the big powerhouse that it </v>

170
00:09:16.721 --> 00:09:18.450
<v Speaker 2>would become later.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And don't forget,</v>

171
00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:20.560
<v Speaker 2>countries like France,</v>
<v Speaker 2>countries like Denmark,</v>

172
00:09:20.561 --> 00:09:21.394
<v Speaker 2>they already had a well funded industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So why did Hollywood achieve so much </v>

173
00:09:25.510 --> 00:09:27.940
<v Speaker 2>success and do it so quickly?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

174
00:09:27.941 --> 00:09:30.440
<v Speaker 2>the answer lies in something called the </v>
<v Speaker 2>network effects,</v>

175
00:09:30.441 --> 00:09:32.550
<v Speaker 2>and if you've been subscribed to this </v>
<v Speaker 2>channel for a while,</v>

176
00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:33.403
<v Speaker 2>you should do that by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>then the chances aren't even know what </v>

177
00:09:35.261 --> 00:09:36.130
<v Speaker 2>this thing is.</v>

178
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.063
<v Speaker 3>All those Hollywood studios attracted </v>
<v Speaker 3>the best investors and professionals </v>

179
00:09:39.921 --> 00:09:40.754
<v Speaker 3>from all around the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This explains why in 1915 Hollywood was </v>

180
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:51.000
<v Speaker 3>the setting for the first super </v>
<v Speaker 3>production in history,</v>

181
00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:54.780
<v Speaker 3>the birth of a nation,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a cost around a hundred thousand dollars</v>

182
00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:55.643
<v Speaker 3>at that time.</v>

183
00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:56.770
<v Speaker 2>That's miscellanea.</v>
<v Speaker 2>By the way,</v>

184
00:09:56.771 --> 00:09:57.604
<v Speaker 2>this movie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was extremely controversial because </v>

185
00:09:59.071 --> 00:10:02.280
<v Speaker 2>essentially it portrayed the KKK as the </v>
<v Speaker 2>good guys,</v>

186
00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:03.173
<v Speaker 2>but I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that's an entire story for a different </v>

187
00:10:04.561 --> 00:10:06.900
<v Speaker 2>day.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The truth is that in less than 10 years,</v>

188
00:10:06.901 --> 00:10:10.320
<v Speaker 2>the population of Hollywood grew to more</v>
<v Speaker 2>than 30,000</v>

189
00:10:10.321 --> 00:10:11.550
<v Speaker 2>inhabitants.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Most of them,</v>

190
00:10:11.551 --> 00:10:14.310
<v Speaker 2>they were immigrants like Francisco </v>
<v Speaker 2>alias this span.</v>

191
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:16.830
<v Speaker 2>He came to Hollywood to work as a </v>
<v Speaker 2>production assistant.</v>

192
00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:24.240
<v Speaker 2>Soon he realized he could translate the </v>
<v Speaker 2>titles of movies into Spanish this way,</v>

193
00:10:24.241 --> 00:10:27.150
<v Speaker 2>the good export them to Spain and Latin </v>
<v Speaker 2>America,</v>

194
00:10:27.240 --> 00:10:29.550
<v Speaker 2>other immigrants with other mother </v>
<v Speaker 2>tongues did the same,</v>

195
00:10:29.551 --> 00:10:33.510
<v Speaker 2>and all of a sudden Hollywood movies </v>
<v Speaker 2>could be understood everywhere.</v>

196
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.253
<v Speaker 4>Oh,</v>

197
00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.530
<v Speaker 2>but hold on just a second because I can </v>
<v Speaker 2>guess what you're thinking.</v>

198
00:10:40.650 --> 00:10:41.483
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens to the movies when they </v>

199
00:10:42.481 --> 00:10:43.560
<v Speaker 2>have sounds?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

200
00:10:43.561 --> 00:10:44.394
<v Speaker 2>actually this was a crucial turning </v>
<v Speaker 2>points in the history of American </v>

201
00:10:46.561 --> 00:10:49.050
<v Speaker 2>movies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I blog now flows.</v>

202
00:10:50.430 --> 00:10:53.610
<v Speaker 2>Let's have a quick look as an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>During the times of Nazi Germany,</v>

203
00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:54.473
<v Speaker 2>the government,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're invested a fortune in </v>

204
00:10:55.861 --> 00:10:56.694
<v Speaker 2>subsidizing German studios,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and of course those companies trying to </v>

205
00:10:59.821 --> 00:11:01.860
<v Speaker 2>export their films to other countries </v>
<v Speaker 2>like Spain.</v>

206
00:11:01.890 --> 00:11:06.030
<v Speaker 2>Spain mounted the dictatorship of </v>
<v Speaker 2>Francisco Franco was a close ally of the</v>

207
00:11:06.031 --> 00:11:07.500
<v Speaker 2>Third Reich.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

208
00:11:07.501 --> 00:11:10.770
<v Speaker 2>almost no Spanish movie theaters </v>
<v Speaker 2>projected a German movie.</v>

209
00:11:10.850 --> 00:11:12.210
<v Speaker 2>That's why was this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

210
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.970
<v Speaker 2>the reason is not as idealistic as you </v>
<v Speaker 2>might hope.</v>

211
00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:15.893
<v Speaker 2>It was a pure technological reason.</v>
<v Speaker 2>German studios sent their movies in the </v>

212
00:11:18.931 --> 00:11:21.390
<v Speaker 2>German language and they didn't have </v>
<v Speaker 2>good systems</v>

213
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.510
<v Speaker 4>out of my shell.</v>

214
00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:30.560
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood studios instead had state of </v>
<v Speaker 2>the art methods for Darby plus.</v>

215
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.870
<v Speaker 2>Since they have such a high immigrant </v>
<v Speaker 2>population,</v>

216
00:11:32.990 --> 00:11:35.990
<v Speaker 2>it was easier for them to find </v>
<v Speaker 2>translators and voice actors.</v>

217
00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.390
<v Speaker 2>Some countries even had their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>offices in Spain,</v>

218
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:39.283
<v Speaker 2>so they sent the cellular Lloyd ready to</v>
<v Speaker 2>be replaced with the Spanish audio </v>

219
00:11:41.841 --> 00:11:42.430
<v Speaker 2>track.</v>

220
00:11:42.430 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 5>There you go.</v>
<v Speaker 5>Yeah.</v>

221
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.040
<v Speaker 5>They don't know about [inaudible].</v>

222
00:11:56.590 --> 00:11:57.423
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>American movies were cheaper to </v>

223
00:11:58.601 --> 00:12:00.840
<v Speaker 2>projections and those from any other </v>
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>

224
00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:01.813
<v Speaker 3>How did this,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the peerless talent of those movie </v>

225
00:12:02.971 --> 00:12:06.960
<v Speaker 3>geniuses like John Ford who came from </v>
<v Speaker 3>Ireland and Ernst Lubitsch who came from</v>

226
00:12:06.961 --> 00:12:07.794
<v Speaker 3>Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 3>those were the ultimate weapons that </v>

227
00:12:09.061 --> 00:12:11.760
<v Speaker 3>drove America to surpass any other </v>
<v Speaker 3>countries.</v>

228
00:12:11.761 --> 00:12:12.594
<v Speaker 3>Movie Industry.</v>

229
00:12:15.570 --> 00:12:19.510
<v Speaker 6>I sit at you liberty.</v>
<v Speaker 6>You pick it up.</v>

230
00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:21.210
<v Speaker 2>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Oh yes.</v>

231
00:12:21.211 --> 00:12:22.044
<v Speaker 2>Hollywood was born.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Thanks to those who came from outside </v>

232
00:12:23.971 --> 00:12:24.804
<v Speaker 2>America and Hollywood grew up thanks to </v>
<v Speaker 2>selling their movies to the people </v>

233
00:12:28.111 --> 00:12:28.720
<v Speaker 2>outside.</v>

234
00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.760
<v Speaker 3>If America at her,</v>
