1
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.490
<v Speaker 1>In the next few decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the wells as we know it,</v>

2
00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.413
<v Speaker 1>will change the loss.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This will of course bring many </v>

3
00:00:14.371 --> 00:00:17.490
<v Speaker 1>opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also many challenges more precisely.</v>

4
00:00:17.491 --> 00:00:18.324
<v Speaker 1>Most of developed countries are facing </v>
<v Speaker 1>such a large threats that that response </v>

5
00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:23.730
<v Speaker 1>may determine in economic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>political,</v>

6
00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:26.970
<v Speaker 1>and social times which countries succeed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and which fail.</v>

7
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.833
<v Speaker 1>Folks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm talking about population aging of </v>

8
00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:33.570
<v Speaker 1>the demographic pyramids.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred and 80 degree turn.</v>

9
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.990
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure this isn't news to you.</v>

10
00:00:40.991 --> 00:00:43.600
<v Speaker 1>Most of you have probably already heard </v>
<v Speaker 1>about this subject.</v>

11
00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:44.463
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>have you stopped to think about the </v>

12
00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.533
<v Speaker 1>processes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences on your government's doing </v>

13
00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.863
<v Speaker 1>something about it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have they come up with something like a </v>

14
00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.760
<v Speaker 1>contingency plan so you face the risks </v>
<v Speaker 1>that lie ahead?</v>

15
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.850
<v Speaker 1>I'll listen up world facing a new state</v>

16
00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.020
<v Speaker 1>about a hundred years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Our world has changed a lot.</v>

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.060
<v Speaker 1>It has changed so much that if we got a </v>
<v Speaker 1>time machines,</v>

18
00:01:13.061 --> 00:01:17.220
<v Speaker 1>they some sort of special delorean and </v>
<v Speaker 1>traveled back two or three centuries for</v>

19
00:01:17.221 --> 00:01:20.670
<v Speaker 1>a season sooner rather than later.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of us,</v>

20
00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.100
<v Speaker 1>if not all of us,</v>
<v Speaker 1>would want to go back home really,</v>

21
00:01:23.101 --> 00:01:25.410
<v Speaker 1>really fast.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd be missing loads of things.</v>

22
00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.244
<v Speaker 1>Would be horrified by the day to day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we'd be forced to work intensely harder </v>

23
00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.590
<v Speaker 1>just to survive and we'd be afraid of </v>
<v Speaker 1>getting sick because we might die and we</v>

24
00:01:34.591 --> 00:01:37.620
<v Speaker 1>might not even be able to eat.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But let's stay on topic.</v>

25
00:01:37.621 --> 00:01:42.220
<v Speaker 1>Here it is.</v>
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the 19th century,</v>

26
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:45.610
<v Speaker 1>the world's population surpass the one </v>
<v Speaker 1>point 5 billion person.</v>

27
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:47.563
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.710
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>100 years later during the 20th century,</v>

29
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.740
<v Speaker 1>the world's population has multiplied by</v>
<v Speaker 1>four and past 6 billion of course,</v>

30
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.200
<v Speaker 1>considering the enormous speed with </v>
<v Speaker 1>which the world population group,</v>

31
00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.170
<v Speaker 1>we can't be surprised by the fact that </v>
<v Speaker 1>many experts began to worry about of the</v>

32
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.023
<v Speaker 1>population and do you not think that </v>
<v Speaker 1>this was just a thing among mediocre </v>

33
00:02:12.561 --> 00:02:17.561
<v Speaker 1>expert scientists and politicians?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nineteen 74,</v>

34
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.223
<v Speaker 1>a report by the Secretary of State,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon's </v>

35
00:02:22.121 --> 00:02:25.450
<v Speaker 1>government to consider birth control in </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries such as Brazil,</v>

36
00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:26.261
<v Speaker 1>India,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

37
00:02:26.261 --> 00:02:27.340
<v Speaker 1>Columbia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Ethiopia,</v>

38
00:02:27.341 --> 00:02:29.590
<v Speaker 1>and Thailand as a top priority.</v>

39
00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.510
<v Speaker 2>Cool.</v>

40
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:32.343
<v Speaker 1>Coming to the report,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the demographic explosion that was </v>

41
00:02:34.031 --> 00:02:38.770
<v Speaker 1>taking place posed a serious threat to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the security of the United States.</v>

42
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.420
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With</v>

43
00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.263
<v Speaker 1>so many people consuming resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Kissinger thought we were heading </v>

44
00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:48.480
<v Speaker 1>towards a world of scarcity and fear </v>
<v Speaker 1>struggles for resources.</v>

45
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.450
<v Speaker 1>Have you noticed how Malthusian </v>
<v Speaker 1>arguments come up again and again,</v>

46
00:02:51.451 --> 00:02:53.410
<v Speaker 1>even though they never actually </v>
<v Speaker 1>happened?</v>

47
00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:56.603
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that while guys like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Kissinger try to think about how to </v>

48
00:02:59.020 --> 00:02:59.853
<v Speaker 1>control the world's population and </v>
<v Speaker 1>influence their decisions to change was </v>

49
00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:05.410
<v Speaker 1>already taking place.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Such a huge change that it would turn an</v>

50
00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:10.411
<v Speaker 1>entirely new points in the debate.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the last 50 years.</v>

51
00:03:17.461 --> 00:03:18.294
<v Speaker 1>Welds fertility has halved so much so </v>
<v Speaker 1>that nowadays Western governments no </v>

52
00:03:21.331 --> 00:03:25.080
<v Speaker 1>longer think about overpopulation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but rather about aging today,</v>

53
00:03:25.081 --> 00:03:29.160
<v Speaker 1>European countries and even the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States tend to lose native inhabitants.</v>

54
00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.420
<v Speaker 1>Check this out.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In Germany,</v>

55
00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:34.370
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 1972,</v>

56
00:03:34.371 --> 00:03:37.730
<v Speaker 1>there have been 5 million more deaths </v>
<v Speaker 1>than births.</v>

57
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:38.623
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the most extreme case has been that of </v>

58
00:03:40.331 --> 00:03:44.450
<v Speaker 1>Russia were in just 20 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Between 1991 and 2011.</v>

59
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.313
<v Speaker 1>Then we're at 13 point one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three more deaths than there were </v>

60
00:03:48.651 --> 00:03:51.230
<v Speaker 1>births.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Future projections show that in the next</v>

61
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:53.750
<v Speaker 1>50 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Europe's native population will decrease</v>

62
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.360
<v Speaker 1>fire rounds.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One hundred million people.</v>

63
00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.340
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

64
00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.353
<v Speaker 1>just that the other effect of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>entire process is that the world's </v>

65
00:04:03.001 --> 00:04:03.834
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially if out of the most developed </v>

66
00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>countries is aging at full speed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>that my friends,</v>

67
00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.830
<v Speaker 1>it's posing many,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many challenges,</v>

68
00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:12.450
<v Speaker 1>pensions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>healthcare expenses,</v>

69
00:04:12.451 --> 00:04:14.310
<v Speaker 1>dependence,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and the question is now,</v>

70
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.173
<v Speaker 1>how on earth can we finance this </v>
<v Speaker 1>gigantic expense to give you an idea of </v>

71
00:04:18.691 --> 00:04:19.524
<v Speaker 1>what we're talking about here is </v>
<v Speaker 1>estimated that in many European </v>

72
00:04:21.091 --> 00:04:23.850
<v Speaker 1>countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the percentage of the population over 65</v>

73
00:04:23.851 --> 00:04:24.684
<v Speaker 1>years old will be around 40 percent by </v>
<v Speaker 1>2050 and one of those most effected </v>

74
00:04:28.561 --> 00:04:33.561
<v Speaker 1>countries is actually Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So listen up country of retired people.</v>

75
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.330
<v Speaker 1>Here's an exercise for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's assume that fertility in Spain and</v>

76
00:04:45.331 --> 00:04:46.164
<v Speaker 1>the European Union remains within the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rates that they've had since the year </v>

77
00:04:48.931 --> 00:04:52.050
<v Speaker 1>2000 and that's in addition.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No immigrants arrive.</v>

78
00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.730
<v Speaker 1>You want to know what's going to happen?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

79
00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:54.720
<v Speaker 1>check out the following week,</v>

80
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:55.653
<v Speaker 2>Ralph</v>

81
00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.710
<v Speaker 1>and see if the population aged between </v>
<v Speaker 1>18 and 40 years,</v>

82
00:05:00.711 --> 00:05:01.544
<v Speaker 1>which is the population that works the </v>
<v Speaker 1>most and the population that has the </v>

83
00:05:03.471 --> 00:05:05.990
<v Speaker 1>most children.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's going to take a huge dip.</v>

84
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.790
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the number of inhabitants,</v>

85
00:05:07.791 --> 00:05:10.000
<v Speaker 1>just a decade later that followed the </v>
<v Speaker 1>same trap.</v>

86
00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.473
<v Speaker 1>Spain is one of the countries that's </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning to suffer the most from this </v>

87
00:05:16.721 --> 00:05:20.950
<v Speaker 1>demographic crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The demographic crisis is getting worse.</v>

88
00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:24.490
<v Speaker 1>Spain suffers it's biggest population </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss in 2017.</v>

89
00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:27.730
<v Speaker 1>If we take a look at the average number </v>
<v Speaker 1>of children per women,</v>

90
00:05:27.731 --> 00:05:28.564
<v Speaker 1>we can truly understand what was going </v>
<v Speaker 1>on here and this is taking into account </v>

91
00:05:41.251 --> 00:05:45.390
<v Speaker 1>that the arrival of immigrants in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>last 20 years has boosted birthrates.</v>

92
00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:46.283
<v Speaker 1>Nowadays,</v>
<v Speaker 1>23 percent of all children born in </v>

93
00:05:47.971 --> 00:05:50.790
<v Speaker 1>Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost one in four have a foreign</v>

94
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.820
<v Speaker 2>mother fucker boss.</v>

95
00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:58.173
<v Speaker 1>The most important data to predict </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's going to happen will come from </v>

96
00:06:00.341 --> 00:06:03.430
<v Speaker 1>looking at how the number of people of </v>
<v Speaker 1>working age will evolve.</v>

97
00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.480
<v Speaker 1>They after all other ones who generate </v>
<v Speaker 1>the vast majority of resources,</v>

98
00:06:07.481 --> 00:06:08.910
<v Speaker 1>both public and private.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

99
00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:12.430
<v Speaker 1>if we assume that there's no immigration</v>
<v Speaker 1>in just 30 years,</v>

100
00:06:12.431 --> 00:06:16.000
<v Speaker 1>the working age population would </v>
<v Speaker 1>decrease by 10 million people.</v>

101
00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.853
<v Speaker 1>It's according to the projections of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>Institute of Statistics of the </v>

102
00:06:19.151 --> 00:06:19.984
<v Speaker 1>government of Spain.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Spaniards will face this panorama by </v>

103
00:06:22.331 --> 00:06:23.210
<v Speaker 1>2015.</v>

104
00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.433
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

105
00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:28.320
<v Speaker 1>30 million people of working age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of whom,</v>

106
00:06:28.321 --> 00:06:32.370
<v Speaker 1>of course not a world work and almost 22</v>
<v Speaker 1>million children and retirees.</v>

107
00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.263
<v Speaker 1>That is the dependent population would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be greater than the working age </v>

108
00:06:36.121 --> 00:06:36.954
<v Speaker 1>population.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

109
00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.440
<v Speaker 1>Now we're talking about Spain </v>
<v Speaker 1>specifically here,</v>

110
00:06:43.441 --> 00:06:46.590
<v Speaker 1>but this scenario is very familiar to </v>
<v Speaker 1>most developed countries.</v>

111
00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:49.410
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of this has many consequences.</v>

112
00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:56.853
<v Speaker 1>The consequences in recent times there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>been a lot of talk about the risk of </v>

113
00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:04.193
<v Speaker 1>automation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but perhaps the most imminent risk that </v>

114
00:07:06.331 --> 00:07:09.960
<v Speaker 1>developed countries have to face is that</v>
<v Speaker 1>quick aging process.</v>

115
00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.023
<v Speaker 1>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's clear that an agent population has </v>

116
00:07:15.521 --> 00:07:17.260
<v Speaker 1>several consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>

117
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:19.360
<v Speaker 1>it's foreseeable that if nothing </v>
<v Speaker 1>changes,</v>

118
00:07:19.361 --> 00:07:22.210
<v Speaker 1>public spending will skyrockets to pay </v>
<v Speaker 1>pensions,</v>

119
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:24.750
<v Speaker 1>healthcare expenses assistance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Kathy,</v>

120
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:26.950
<v Speaker 1>the elderly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>among many other things.</v>

121
00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Pension spending increases by 50 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>in Spain in 10 years,</v>

122
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:33.363
<v Speaker 1>and no doubt,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this will be very clear as a politician </v>

123
00:07:35.001 --> 00:07:35.834
<v Speaker 1>and sleep hygiene,</v>
<v Speaker 1>many have retired voters will be </v>

124
00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:40.480
<v Speaker 1>overwhelming.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simply a matter of votes,</v>

125
00:07:43.210 --> 00:07:46.280
<v Speaker 1>but at the same time as we've seen,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are going to be off.</v>

126
00:07:46.281 --> 00:07:47.114
<v Speaker 1>You are working age people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so the question is how on earth are we </v>

127
00:07:49.631 --> 00:07:50.464
<v Speaker 1>going to pay for this huge expense?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Will the already high taxes be raised </v>

128
00:07:53.891 --> 00:07:54.724
<v Speaker 1>even further damaging the </v>
<v Speaker 1>competitiveness of countries with as </v>

129
00:07:57.101 --> 00:07:59.800
<v Speaker 1>many economic problems as Spain or </v>
<v Speaker 1>perhaps Italy?</v>

130
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.870
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the reality is that's a recipe that just</v>

131
00:08:01.871 --> 00:08:03.280
<v Speaker 1>doesn't work.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now at this point,</v>

132
00:08:03.281 --> 00:08:05.440
<v Speaker 1>I think we need to answer a mandatory </v>
<v Speaker 1>question.</v>

133
00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.120
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what the hell can we do?</v>

134
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:15.250
<v Speaker 1>We need a plan.</v>

135
00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:18.000
<v Speaker 3>I know</v>

136
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:20.860
<v Speaker 1>and politicians don't usually like to </v>
<v Speaker 1>think about the future.</v>

137
00:08:20.861 --> 00:08:24.610
<v Speaker 1>Especially future problems probably goes</v>
<v Speaker 1>a little something like this.</v>

138
00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.473
<v Speaker 1>What I need to think about problems that</v>
<v Speaker 1>will happen in 20 years from now when </v>

139
00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:29.800
<v Speaker 1>the risk losing votes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>

140
00:08:29.801 --> 00:08:30.071
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

141
00:08:30.071 --> 00:08:30.311
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>

142
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:31.000
<v Speaker 1>no,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no.</v>

143
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.440
<v Speaker 1>Let someone else take care of that.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:08:32.441 --> 00:08:34.660
<v Speaker 1>if we don't want to see headlines like </v>
<v Speaker 1>this developed,</v>

145
00:08:34.661 --> 00:08:35.494
<v Speaker 1>countries are going to need a plan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan's finance minister tells elderly </v>

146
00:08:40.571 --> 00:08:44.350
<v Speaker 1>they should hurry up and die to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>reduce countries rising.</v>

147
00:08:44.351 --> 00:08:45.184
<v Speaker 1>Welfare bill.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The time to make decisions is now in </v>

148
00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:51.640
<v Speaker 1>countries that decide to look the other </v>
<v Speaker 1>way and do nothing will face many,</v>

149
00:08:51.790 --> 00:08:56.790
<v Speaker 1>many problems in the future.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see lately here on visual politic,</v>

150
00:08:57.771 --> 00:09:02.090
<v Speaker 1>we've talked a lot about immigration.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While experience tells us that this is a</v>

151
00:09:02.091 --> 00:09:06.590
<v Speaker 1>good way to stop population aging and </v>
<v Speaker 1>buy time to make new reform.</v>

152
00:09:08.350 --> 00:09:09.890
<v Speaker 4>As Australia,</v>
<v Speaker 4>Hong Kong,</v>

153
00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:10.783
<v Speaker 4>New Zealand and Singapore have shown </v>
<v Speaker 4>integration can soften the blow from </v>

154
00:09:13.851 --> 00:09:15.590
<v Speaker 4>rapid aging.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Sean Young Rhee,</v>

155
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.850
<v Speaker 4>director of Asia Pacific Department at </v>
<v Speaker 4>the International Monetary Fund.</v>

156
00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.660
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Despite many politicians discourse,</v>

157
00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:23.583
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that developed countries </v>
<v Speaker 1>will need many people to arrive from </v>

158
00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:27.880
<v Speaker 1>abroad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so folks,</v>

159
00:09:27.881 --> 00:09:30.820
<v Speaker 1>instead of thinking about building walls</v>
<v Speaker 1>and closing borders,</v>

160
00:09:30.821 --> 00:09:31.654
<v Speaker 1>it would be much more advisable to start</v>
<v Speaker 1>a system that manages to attract people </v>

161
00:09:35.231 --> 00:09:39.370
<v Speaker 1>from outside in an orderly fashion and </v>
<v Speaker 1>facilitates the integration,</v>

162
00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:40.233
<v Speaker 1>but of course that's not all as public </v>
<v Speaker 1>pension systems will almost certainly </v>

163
00:09:46.851 --> 00:09:49.810
<v Speaker 1>become much less generous because they </v>
<v Speaker 1>won't have as much of a budget.</v>

164
00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.683
<v Speaker 1>Governments should also be promoting </v>
<v Speaker 1>saving both from the governments </v>

165
00:09:53.691 --> 00:09:55.730
<v Speaker 1>themselves and from families.</v>

166
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:58.393
<v Speaker 4>Any Spanish political party warning </v>
<v Speaker 4>citizens of the next cut in their </v>

167
00:10:02.061 --> 00:10:03.350
<v Speaker 4>pensions.</v>
<v Speaker 4>No,</v>

168
00:10:03.410 --> 00:10:05.390
<v Speaker 4>they're all silent about our true </v>
<v Speaker 4>future,</v>

169
00:10:05.450 --> 00:10:06.283
<v Speaker 4>giving a false impression that one </v>
<v Speaker 4>doesn't need to save to guarantee a </v>

170
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.590
<v Speaker 4>fairly dignified retirement.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Quander,</v>

171
00:10:11.591 --> 00:10:15.710
<v Speaker 4>I'm on an IO economist and director of </v>
<v Speaker 4>the one day Marianna Institute,</v>

172
00:10:15.870 --> 00:10:16.703
<v Speaker 1>and along with all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course governments should promote </v>

173
00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.473
<v Speaker 1>policies that attract companies that </v>
<v Speaker 1>promote entrepreneurship and the bubble </v>

174
00:10:22.270 --> 00:10:23.103
<v Speaker 1>that favor productivity investments in </v>
<v Speaker 1>machines and technology and in research </v>

175
00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:28.120
<v Speaker 1>and developments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

176
00:10:28.121 --> 00:10:31.180
<v Speaker 1>I think robots are actually going to </v>
<v Speaker 1>greatly help with this problem.</v>

177
00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.330
<v Speaker 1>Unfortunately,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in many of the affected countries,</v>

178
00:10:37.331 --> 00:10:39.610
<v Speaker 1>including Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>nothing has been done.</v>

179
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:42.670
<v Speaker 1>And finally before we finish,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd like to throw out an idea.</v>

180
00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:46.780
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the effects of aging is accompanied by a</v>

181
00:10:46.781 --> 00:10:48.910
<v Speaker 1>longevity effects.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want me to explain this.</v>

182
00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.720
<v Speaker 1>Thanks to medical advances that </v>
<v Speaker 1>nutrition into quality of life mortality</v>

183
00:10:52.721 --> 00:10:53.554
<v Speaker 1>rates for all ages,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so have decreased that his people a </v>

184
00:10:56.140 --> 00:11:00.710
<v Speaker 1>younger for long see in the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

185
00:11:00.711 --> 00:11:01.544
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the 75 year old person has the same </v>

186
00:11:03.201 --> 00:11:08.120
<v Speaker 1>mortality rate today as a 65 year old </v>
<v Speaker 1>person had in the 19 fifties in Japan.</v>

187
00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 1>80 is the new 65</v>

188
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:15.060
<v Speaker 1>and also thanks to medical and </v>
<v Speaker 1>technological advances,</v>

189
00:11:15.061 --> 00:11:17.190
<v Speaker 1>this evolution,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it continues to grow and grow,</v>

190
00:11:17.191 --> 00:11:19.500
<v Speaker 1>which the humanity is fantastic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>

191
00:11:19.501 --> 00:11:22.170
<v Speaker 1>if people have a longer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more productive life,</v>

192
00:11:22.171 --> 00:11:23.004
<v Speaker 1>wouldn't it be wise to encourage them to</v>
<v Speaker 1>continue working for longer and you've </v>

193
00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:26.864
<v Speaker 1>even partially or in more comfortable </v>
<v Speaker 1>roles and that's where I'm going to </v>

194
00:11:29.651 --> 00:11:31.710
<v Speaker 1>leave today's video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but now it's your turn.</v>

195
00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:34.920
<v Speaker 1>Would you be in favor of increasing your</v>
<v Speaker 1>country's retirement age?</v>
