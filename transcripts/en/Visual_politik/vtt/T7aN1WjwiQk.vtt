<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.373
<v Speaker 2>so a few weeks ago,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I told you the story of the Tokyo </v>

3
00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:13.660
<v Speaker 2>Olympics in 2020 and all the problems </v>
<v Speaker 2>that they're facing,</v>

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.653
<v Speaker 2>any of the Olympic Games are one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most expensive events that a city can </v>

5
00:00:17.441 --> 00:00:18.550
<v Speaker 2>host.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

6
00:00:18.551 --> 00:00:23.050
<v Speaker 2>usually city hauls go crazy to get a </v>
<v Speaker 2>chance to organize the limbics.</v>

7
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:23.973
<v Speaker 2>Usually they always have the support of </v>
<v Speaker 2>their national governments and their </v>

8
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.310
<v Speaker 2>citizens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

9
00:00:32.541 --> 00:00:33.374
<v Speaker 2>each time they'd make a survey,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of the people are happy about </v>

10
00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.470
<v Speaker 2>hosting the Olympic Games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The main opinion is that's an event.</v>

11
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.313
<v Speaker 2>It's lengthy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics brings a lot of good into the </v>

12
00:00:42.411 --> 00:00:44.150
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It increases tourism.</v>

13
00:00:44.151 --> 00:00:44.984
<v Speaker 2>The host city gets renovators and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country becomes fashionable attracting </v>

14
00:00:48.051 --> 00:00:50.900
<v Speaker 2>investors and businessmen from all over </v>
<v Speaker 2>the world.</v>

15
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.180
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you've seen our video about Tokyo,</v>

16
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.450
<v Speaker 2>you know that this isn't exactly true.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

17
00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.300
<v Speaker 2>the Olympics can create big problems in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Japan,</v>

18
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.160
<v Speaker 2>might end up going bankrupt from going </v>
<v Speaker 2>so far over budget.</v>

19
00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:09.213
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we can say that is a big debate about </v>

20
00:01:10.841 --> 00:01:13.480
<v Speaker 2>whether it's goods or bad.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's a host,</v>

21
00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.220
<v Speaker 2>the Olympic Games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and guess what?</v>

22
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:16.203
<v Speaker 2>The Olympic excitements is not exactly </v>
<v Speaker 2>having its best hour until 2012 each </v>

23
00:01:20.441 --> 00:01:24.700
<v Speaker 2>time the International Olympic Committee</v>
<v Speaker 2>met to choose the next host city.</v>

24
00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.730
<v Speaker 2>There were around five candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

25
00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.380
<v Speaker 2>the 2024 games had just two candidates,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles and Paris.</v>

26
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.263
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

27
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Many capitals like boot of hash or Rome </v>
<v Speaker 2>retired their bid at the last minute and</v>

28
00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:42.464
<v Speaker 2>others like Hamburg and Germany organize</v>
<v Speaker 2>a referendum or citizens voted against </v>

29
00:01:46.491 --> 00:01:48.380
<v Speaker 2>hosting the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

30
00:01:48.381 --> 00:01:49.214
<v Speaker 2>you heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>There is the general disappointments </v>

31
00:01:50.961 --> 00:01:51.794
<v Speaker 2>about the Olympics and this might be a </v>
<v Speaker 2>big problem for the International </v>

32
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.620
<v Speaker 2>Olympic Committee if nobody wants to </v>
<v Speaker 2>host.</v>

33
00:01:57.621 --> 00:01:58.454
<v Speaker 2>I mean what could happen to the future </v>
<v Speaker 2>of the Olympic Games and the bigger </v>

34
00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.080
<v Speaker 2>question of course is,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

35
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:03.973
<v Speaker 2>is this the end of the Olympics spirits?</v>
<v Speaker 2>So what could we do to keep the Olympic </v>

36
00:02:08.001 --> 00:02:09.230
<v Speaker 2>flame burning?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

37
00:02:09.231 --> 00:02:11.080
<v Speaker 2>today we're going to answer those </v>
<v Speaker 2>questions,</v>

38
00:02:11.081 --> 00:02:13.000
<v Speaker 2>but before we do that is take a look </v>
<v Speaker 2>back at the history.</v>

39
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.843
<v Speaker 1>Great.</v>

40
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:17.683
<v Speaker 2>Vic Breakfast.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm sure that every one of you knows </v>

41
00:02:19.641 --> 00:02:22.370
<v Speaker 2>that the Olympic Games work she did in </v>
<v Speaker 2>ancient Greece,</v>

42
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:23.204
<v Speaker 2>but the truth is that the muzzle </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympics has nothing to do with Mount </v>

43
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.893
<v Speaker 2>Olympus.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It really started in the 1896 with a </v>

44
00:02:28.581 --> 00:02:31.040
<v Speaker 2>French born baron named Pierre to cook a</v>
<v Speaker 2>tall,</v>

45
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.710
<v Speaker 2>along with a Greek man named evangelist </v>
<v Speaker 2>Zapper.</v>

46
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.603
<v Speaker 2>They convince the Greek government to </v>
<v Speaker 2>organize some games the same way that </v>

47
00:02:36.951 --> 00:02:40.310
<v Speaker 2>the ancient Greeks sat back then,</v>
<v Speaker 2>nationalism was high in Greece,</v>

48
00:02:40.311 --> 00:02:41.144
<v Speaker 2>so everything that helps to inflame the </v>
<v Speaker 2>national pride was seen as a good idea </v>

49
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:45.614
<v Speaker 2>by the government.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how the first modern Olympics </v>

50
00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.750
<v Speaker 2>we're organized in Athens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

51
00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.673
<v Speaker 2>he had to keep,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it all had bigger plans than simple </v>

52
00:02:53.331 --> 00:02:57.320
<v Speaker 2>nationalist propaganda.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This could be an international events.</v>

53
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.810
<v Speaker 2>What's in order to achieve this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The host city had to rotate.</v>

54
00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.670
<v Speaker 2>This is how the International Olympic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Committee also known as I oh c was born.</v>

55
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.803
<v Speaker 2>The IOC is an organization responsible </v>
<v Speaker 2>for ensuring that every four years we </v>

56
00:03:14.081 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>have the winter Olympics,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the summer Olympics,</v>

57
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.550
<v Speaker 2>and the Paralympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Put it another way.</v>

58
00:03:18.551 --> 00:03:22.840
<v Speaker 2>This committee's mission is to promote </v>
<v Speaker 2>sports and tolerance among nations.</v>

59
00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:27.580
<v Speaker 2>And this was a pretty wonderful idea,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but do hold on for just a second because</v>

60
00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.340
<v Speaker 2>we are just getting started with our </v>
<v Speaker 2>story.</v>

61
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.353
<v Speaker 2>The first Olympic Games were pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>modest events that were organized next </v>

62
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:34.684
<v Speaker 2>to international exhibitions,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but things really changed in the year </v>

63
00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:38.980
<v Speaker 2>1936</v>

64
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:43.373
<v Speaker 1>okay.</v>

65
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.120
<v Speaker 2>As you know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>

66
00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:47.070
<v Speaker 2>Nazi Germany,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

67
00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.973
<v Speaker 2>they were about to start their world </v>
<v Speaker 2>conquest to this end is they needed to </v>

68
00:03:50.771 --> 00:03:51.604
<v Speaker 2>improve that image abroad and is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>idea of wrapping themselves with the </v>

69
00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:54.964
<v Speaker 2>flag of sports excellence and tolerance </v>
<v Speaker 2>between nations sounded like heaven to </v>

70
00:03:58.601 --> 00:03:59.434
<v Speaker 2>the ears of adult headlock and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>why the Bellin Olympic Games in 1936 </v>

71
00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:07.060
<v Speaker 2>became the first Olympic super reduction</v>
<v Speaker 2>in history.</v>

72
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.720
<v Speaker 2>It cost more than 30 million US dollars </v>
<v Speaker 2>at the time,</v>

73
00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.810
<v Speaker 2>and that was an insane amount of money </v>
<v Speaker 2>back in the day.</v>

74
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.733
<v Speaker 2>The precedent for hosted cities </v>
<v Speaker 2>overspending on the Olympic Games while </v>

75
00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:19.540
<v Speaker 2>it all came from Nazi Germany.</v>

76
00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:27.563
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

77
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.460
<v Speaker 2>But the first big economic catastrophe,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that came many years later with the</v>

78
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.870
<v Speaker 2>Montreal Olympics in 1976</v>

79
00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:37.833
<v Speaker 3>those games ended up costing eight times</v>
<v Speaker 3>more than the initial budget and they </v>

80
00:04:41.981 --> 00:04:42.814
<v Speaker 3>had lasting financial consequences.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Canada didn't finish paying the debt in </v>

81
00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:47.064
<v Speaker 3>incurred to finance those games until </v>
<v Speaker 3>2006 they even had to create a new </v>

82
00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:54.050
<v Speaker 3>special tax for tobacco in order to </v>
<v Speaker 3>cover the costs.</v>

83
00:04:57.370 --> 00:04:59.110
<v Speaker 2>I'm the story here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's really simple.</v>

84
00:04:59.111 --> 00:05:02.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean there were lots of cities who </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to host the Olympics,</v>

85
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.830
<v Speaker 2>but first they need to be chosen by the </v>
<v Speaker 2>IOC.</v>

86
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.590
<v Speaker 2>And as you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the more you are willing to spend,</v>

87
00:05:08.591 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 2>the higher your chances of winning the </v>
<v Speaker 2>bid.</v>

88
00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.973
<v Speaker 2>And listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I can probably guess what you're </v>

89
00:05:12.821 --> 00:05:13.654
<v Speaker 2>thinking right now.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Why is money that's important to the </v>

90
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.310
<v Speaker 2>International Olympic Committee?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you know what I mean?</v>

91
00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:21.220
<v Speaker 2>Didn't we just say that what matters </v>
<v Speaker 2>here is the tolerance,</v>

92
00:05:21.221 --> 00:05:23.800
<v Speaker 2>the excellence and the sports.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

93
00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:24.970
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you are right,</v>

94
00:05:24.971 --> 00:05:25.804
<v Speaker 2>but the budget is not the only element </v>
<v Speaker 2>that the IOC takes into account when it </v>

95
00:05:28.751 --> 00:05:29.584
<v Speaker 2>chooses a host sissy.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There are plenty of other factors that </v>

96
00:05:32.261 --> 00:05:33.130
<v Speaker 2>they need to keep in mind.</v>

97
00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:37.490
<v Speaker 1>Okay.</v>

98
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.960
<v Speaker 3>Bribery scandal threatens to shrink 2002</v>
<v Speaker 3>Winter Games,</v>

99
00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.170
<v Speaker 2>man,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that is just one example.</v>

100
00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:47.380
<v Speaker 2>According to the AISC manual,</v>
<v Speaker 2>each time they visit one candidate city,</v>

101
00:05:47.381 --> 00:05:48.214
<v Speaker 2>the town hall must pay for a four or </v>
<v Speaker 2>five star hotel and international </v>

102
00:05:51.011 --> 00:05:54.430
<v Speaker 2>breakfast and luxury private cars for </v>
<v Speaker 2>each of their members.</v>

103
00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:55.323
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is actually specified in the </v>

104
00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>guidelines and listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>according to recent investigations,</v>

105
00:06:00.111 --> 00:06:00.944
<v Speaker 2>the parties that are held to entertain </v>
<v Speaker 2>the IOC members would pretty much make </v>

106
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:07.250
<v Speaker 2>Berlusconi's orgies look like Sunday </v>
<v Speaker 2>mass.</v>

107
00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:08.223
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so you might think that with that last </v>

108
00:06:09.051 --> 00:06:10.730
<v Speaker 2>statement,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm exaggerating a little,</v>

109
00:06:10.731 --> 00:06:12.070
<v Speaker 2>but really I,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I</v>

110
00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.083
<v Speaker 1>no</v>

111
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.713
<v Speaker 3>to IOC members accepted offers of </v>
<v Speaker 3>prostitution from the Amsterdam </v>

112
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.610
<v Speaker 3>Committee that bid for the 1992 summer </v>
<v Speaker 3>games.</v>

113
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:28.673
<v Speaker 2>As you can see,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not like the IOC members live like </v>

114
00:06:30.211 --> 00:06:31.170
<v Speaker 2>rockstars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Indeed,</v>

115
00:06:31.171 --> 00:06:34.470
<v Speaker 2>I would say that rock stars who wished </v>
<v Speaker 2>they lived like IOC members.</v>

116
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.803
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>do you know what the best parts of all </v>

117
00:06:37.081 --> 00:06:37.914
<v Speaker 2>of this as well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>their organization makes millions of </v>

118
00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:41.183
<v Speaker 2>dollars every year,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but they aren't even registered as a </v>

119
00:06:43.501 --> 00:06:44.334
<v Speaker 2>company.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The IOC is technically a nonprofit </v>

120
00:06:45.931 --> 00:06:48.390
<v Speaker 2>organization headquartered in </v>
<v Speaker 2>Switzerland.</v>

121
00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.670
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so what does that actually mean?</v>

122
00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:51.593
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>essentially it means that they don't </v>

123
00:06:52.561 --> 00:06:55.710
<v Speaker 2>need to pay taxes and they can use all </v>
<v Speaker 2>kinds of strategies.</v>

124
00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.420
<v Speaker 2>Do you honey their accounting book?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

125
00:06:57.430 --> 00:06:58.263
<v Speaker 2>it essentially means that they don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to pay taxes and they can use all </v>

126
00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:03.420
<v Speaker 2>kinds of strategies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you hype their accounting books?</v>

127
00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:07.930
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

128
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:08.763
<v Speaker 2>Now you may remember that we previously </v>
<v Speaker 2>did a video about e sports where we </v>

129
00:07:11.141 --> 00:07:14.740
<v Speaker 2>talked about Formula One Formula One.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While that's a publicly traded company,</v>

130
00:07:14.741 --> 00:07:15.574
<v Speaker 2>and that's why on visual politic we </v>
<v Speaker 2>could give you accurate numbers for how </v>

131
00:07:18.251 --> 00:07:20.470
<v Speaker 2>much money they make.</v>
<v Speaker 2>With the Olympics.</v>

132
00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:22.690
<v Speaker 2>It's far,</v>
<v Speaker 2>far more difficult.</v>

133
00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.553
<v Speaker 2>You can make estimations based on how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much they charge for the broadcasting </v>

134
00:07:26.501 --> 00:07:27.760
<v Speaker 2>rights are.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's,</v>

135
00:07:27.790 --> 00:07:29.860
<v Speaker 2>that's pretty much it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So now you may be wondering,</v>

136
00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:30.723
<v Speaker 2>why am I sticking quite so much on how </v>
<v Speaker 2>much money the IOC actually makes look </v>

137
00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.533
<v Speaker 2>vast?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because when somebody has a good income </v>

138
00:07:36.611 --> 00:07:37.444
<v Speaker 2>and almost no spending,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean don't forget that the Games are </v>

139
00:07:39.131 --> 00:07:41.560
<v Speaker 2>pretty much paid almost entirely by </v>
<v Speaker 2>local governments.</v>

140
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:45.190
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Then you can invest in things like this.</v>

141
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:49.943
<v Speaker 3>Astroturfing is the practice of masking </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sponsors of a message or </v>

142
00:07:53.671 --> 00:07:55.560
<v Speaker 3>organization.</v>
<v Speaker 3>For example,</v>

143
00:07:55.561 --> 00:07:59.130
<v Speaker 3>political advertising,</v>
<v Speaker 3>religious or public relations to make it</v>

144
00:07:59.131 --> 00:08:04.131
<v Speaker 3>appear as though it originates from and </v>
<v Speaker 3>is supported by grassroots participants.</v>

145
00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:05.873
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you can pay for things like the Olympic </v>

146
00:08:07.371 --> 00:08:08.204
<v Speaker 2>studies centers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which have a presence in several </v>

147
00:08:10.231 --> 00:08:11.064
<v Speaker 2>universities all around the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That job is basically to produce </v>

148
00:08:13.711 --> 00:08:14.544
<v Speaker 2>academic research to prove with </v>
<v Speaker 2>scientific research and data that </v>

149
00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 2>hosting the Olympics is as good as </v>
<v Speaker 2>winning the lottery.</v>

150
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.860
<v Speaker 2>But listen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is not the end of the story here.</v>

151
00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:26.210
<v Speaker 2>I told you some of the reasons why a </v>
<v Speaker 2>city is chosen to host the Olympic,</v>

152
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:28.740
<v Speaker 2>but this is still not the end of our </v>
<v Speaker 2>story today.</v>

153
00:08:28.741 --> 00:08:31.980
<v Speaker 2>I told you some of the reasons </v>
<v Speaker 2>previously why a city would be chosen to</v>

154
00:08:31.981 --> 00:08:33.360
<v Speaker 2>host the Olympics.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

155
00:08:33.420 --> 00:08:37.200
<v Speaker 2>another one is what they call the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Olympic feeling among the citizens.</v>

156
00:08:37.350 --> 00:08:38.183
<v Speaker 2>This means how much people in the city </v>
<v Speaker 2>or country are actually in favor of </v>

157
00:08:42.001 --> 00:08:42.834
<v Speaker 2>hosting the Games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So if you're watching this video from </v>

158
00:08:44.341 --> 00:08:45.174
<v Speaker 2>London,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you probably have some idea of what I'm </v>

159
00:08:46.771 --> 00:08:47.640
<v Speaker 2>talking about.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

160
00:08:47.670 --> 00:08:49.920
<v Speaker 2>all of a sudden the local media is </v>
<v Speaker 2>talking about it,</v>

161
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:50.754
<v Speaker 2>your friends,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the Olympic logo on their facebook </v>

162
00:08:52.441 --> 00:08:54.960
<v Speaker 2>profile picture,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and it's almost impossible.</v>

163
00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:57.410
<v Speaker 2>Find critics on any talk show.</v>

164
00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:02.583
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's really in the interest of the </v>

165
00:09:03.431 --> 00:09:07.420
<v Speaker 2>entire governments and the sponsors to </v>
<v Speaker 2>silence all of the discordant voices.</v>

166
00:09:07.421 --> 00:09:09.250
<v Speaker 2>So this is probably why this happens.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And then,</v>

167
00:09:09.251 --> 00:09:10.084
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what's the conclusion we can draw from </v>

168
00:09:11.081 --> 00:09:12.010
<v Speaker 2>all of this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

169
00:09:12.011 --> 00:09:12.844
<v Speaker 2>in a city like Madrid,</v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 85% of citizens wanted the </v>

170
00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:20.260
<v Speaker 2>Olympic Games according to a survey.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And a similar thing happens in Tokyo and</v>

171
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.123
<v Speaker 2>in pretty much any other host city.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So all of this explains partly the rush </v>

172
00:09:23.861 --> 00:09:26.440
<v Speaker 2>to organize the Olympics that pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>much any cost.</v>

173
00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:27.333
<v Speaker 2>Japan has already announced that they </v>
<v Speaker 2>were spending over 20 billion United </v>

174
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:31.563
<v Speaker 2>States dollars for that Tokyo Olympics </v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2020 Rio de Janeiro in 2012 costs </v>

175
00:09:36.011 --> 00:09:39.490
<v Speaker 2>more than $12 billion for the Brazilian </v>
<v Speaker 2>taxpayer.</v>

176
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.020
<v Speaker 2>And then there's grease.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

177
00:09:41.021 --> 00:09:43.480
<v Speaker 2>that's still paying their debts from </v>
<v Speaker 2>Athens.</v>

178
00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:47.430
<v Speaker 2>And 2004 nonetheless though things they </v>
<v Speaker 2>aren't changing.</v>

179
00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:48.323
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

180
00:09:55.110 --> 00:09:58.350
<v Speaker 2>Is there any future for the Olympics?</v>
<v Speaker 2>As we said before,</v>

181
00:09:58.351 --> 00:10:01.050
<v Speaker 2>in the nineties and the first decade of </v>
<v Speaker 2>this century,</v>

182
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:04.980
<v Speaker 2>anytime the IOC and match,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there were around five candidate cities.</v>

183
00:10:05.010 --> 00:10:05.843
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless in the vote for the Olympics</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 2020 the one that Tokyo one there </v>

184
00:10:09.151 --> 00:10:12.930
<v Speaker 2>were just three candidates in the last </v>
<v Speaker 2>two beds for the Olympics.</v>

185
00:10:12.931 --> 00:10:13.764
<v Speaker 2>2024 and 2028 there wasn't even a single</v>
<v Speaker 2>vote because there was only one </v>

186
00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:21.060
<v Speaker 2>candidate city,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Los Angeles in one case,</v>

187
00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:25.080
<v Speaker 2>and Paris in the other cities like Rome,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Budapest in Stockholm,</v>

188
00:10:25.170 --> 00:10:26.003
<v Speaker 2>which once bid for the Olympics have </v>
<v Speaker 2>already simply retired from the race </v>

189
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:30.850
<v Speaker 2>bay.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just don't think it's worth</v>

190
00:10:30.950 --> 00:10:31.783
<v Speaker 1>money.</v>

191
00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:36.753
<v Speaker 2>And to all of those economists who were </v>
<v Speaker 2>once silenced while they're starting to </v>

192
00:10:39.861 --> 00:10:41.240
<v Speaker 2>appear in the media.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Meanwhile,</v>

193
00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:42.093
<v Speaker 2>the An indie games,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sir losing a lot of their appeal for </v>

194
00:10:43.971 --> 00:10:44.804
<v Speaker 2>audiences,</v>
<v Speaker 2>there are less and less viewers every </v>

195
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.400
<v Speaker 2>time it runs.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Platforms like Netflix,</v>

196
00:10:49.401 --> 00:10:50.234
<v Speaker 2>HBO,</v>
<v Speaker 2>or even indeed Youtube are becoming big </v>

197
00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:52.813
<v Speaker 2>competition for traditional television.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that by the time it Tokyo </v>

198
00:10:55.851 --> 00:10:56.684
<v Speaker 2>2020 years health,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many of you will be watching a TV show </v>

199
00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.200
<v Speaker 2>or official politic video instead of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>synchronized swimming competition.</v>

200
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:04.093
<v Speaker 2>And so well now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well how did the International Olympic </v>

201
00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:09.860
<v Speaker 2>Committee react to this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

202
00:11:09.861 --> 00:11:11.810
<v Speaker 2>the answer is probably going to </v>
<v Speaker 2>disappoint you,</v>

203
00:11:11.811 --> 00:11:12.644
<v Speaker 2>but I see it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

204
00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.960
<v Speaker 2>Ioc Agenda 2020 allows the Olympics in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different host countries.</v>

205
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.320
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I'm not saying this is a bad idea,</v>

206
00:11:24.321 --> 00:11:25.154
<v Speaker 2>but it does make little sense if your </v>
<v Speaker 2>goal is to reduce wasted money when </v>

207
00:11:28.011 --> 00:11:29.690
<v Speaker 2>organizing the Olympic Games.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I mean,</v>

208
00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:30.553
<v Speaker 2>yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it is good now that the spending could </v>

209
00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:35.090
<v Speaker 2>be divided among the taxpayers have two </v>
<v Speaker 2>different countries,</v>

210
00:11:35.270 --> 00:11:37.580
<v Speaker 2>but then also have twice as many venues </v>
<v Speaker 2>as before.</v>

211
00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:41.450
<v Speaker 2>So in other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not actually that great of an idea.</v>

212
00:11:41.540 --> 00:11:42.373
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>wait just a second here because this is </v>

213
00:11:43.641 --> 00:11:44.474
<v Speaker 2>not the only proposal you see lately.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's a movement that suggesting </v>

214
00:11:47.481 --> 00:11:51.920
<v Speaker 2>something a bit more revolutionary.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They wanted to get rid of city rotation.</v>

215
00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:56.353
<v Speaker 2>This would mean that the Olympic Games </v>
<v Speaker 2>would always be organized in the same </v>

216
00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:02.750
<v Speaker 2>city this way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which is neat to buy one stadium and one</v>

217
00:12:02.751 --> 00:12:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Olympic villa that could be reused every</v>
<v Speaker 2>single time.</v>

218
00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.793
<v Speaker 2>Some economists like Andrew's Marlis </v>
<v Speaker 2>suggest Los Angeles is the perfect city </v>

219
00:12:10.220 --> 00:12:11.053
<v Speaker 2>to become the eternal Olympic host.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's big enough they have an </v>

220
00:12:13.791 --> 00:12:14.624
<v Speaker 2>international airport and they can </v>
<v Speaker 2>receive all the tourists and they also </v>

221
00:12:17.421 --> 00:12:19.160
<v Speaker 2>have a pretty solid media industry.</v>

222
00:12:19.380 --> 00:12:20.213
<v Speaker 3>The solution has a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 3>If there is no competition among cities </v>

223
00:12:23.910 --> 00:12:28.500
<v Speaker 3>to host the Olympics and the IOC would </v>
<v Speaker 3>lose its negotiating leverage,</v>

224
00:12:32.840 --> 00:12:33.673
<v Speaker 3>be no incentive to bribe or provide </v>
<v Speaker 3>luxury to IOC leaders and sooner or </v>

225
00:12:38.541 --> 00:12:39.374
<v Speaker 3>later Los Angeles or some other city </v>
<v Speaker 3>that would become the permanent host </v>

226
00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:43.693
<v Speaker 3>would start demanding things like a </v>
<v Speaker 3>greater share of the money from the </v>

227
00:12:46.161 --> 00:12:46.994
<v Speaker 3>broadcasting.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Right.</v>

228
00:12:50.520 --> 00:12:51.353
<v Speaker 2>So now the question comes around too.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you think the International Olympic </v>

229
00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.253
<v Speaker 2>Committee,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we'll find an alternative solution to </v>

230
00:12:56.581 --> 00:12:57.414
<v Speaker 2>get back their lost prestige or perhaps </v>
<v Speaker 2>we will see the ends of the Olympic </v>

231
00:13:01.410 --> 00:13:02.370
<v Speaker 2>Games as we know it's,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

232
00:13:02.371 --> 00:13:05.340
<v Speaker 2>please leave your answer in the comment </v>
<v Speaker 2>section below.</v>

233
