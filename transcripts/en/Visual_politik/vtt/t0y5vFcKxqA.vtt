WEBVTT

1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:00.913
<v Speaker 1>Here are the real politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We love talking about Asia and do you </v>

2
00:00:03.481 --> 00:00:04.314
<v Speaker 1>probably know that by now and we like it</v>
<v Speaker 1>because there were certain things that </v>

3
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:09.870
<v Speaker 1>this region has the can contribute a </v>
<v Speaker 1>loss to the improvements of all.</v>

4
00:00:09.871 --> 00:00:10.020
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

5
00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:10.853
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.173
<v Speaker 1>How was it?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Everything is as good as it sounds </v>

7
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.973
<v Speaker 1>it Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>While we can certainly see plenty of </v>

8
00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:19.394
<v Speaker 1>lights,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are also lots of shadows and the </v>

9
00:00:21.501 --> 00:00:22.334
<v Speaker 1>largest shadow is that without any doubt</v>
<v Speaker 1>the area has become a huge powder keg </v>

10
00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.170
<v Speaker 1>ready to blow.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

11
00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.460
<v Speaker 1>the area is spending more and more in </v>
<v Speaker 1>weapons.</v>

12
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.353
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is expected that by 2020 the region </v>

13
00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:37.850
<v Speaker 1>will accounts for more than 30% of all </v>
<v Speaker 1>of the welds military spending.</v>

14
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.010
<v Speaker 1>On top of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's also becoming a chess board for geo</v>

15
00:00:44.011 --> 00:00:44.844
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China and India are big emerging powers </v>

16
00:00:47.691 --> 00:00:48.524
<v Speaker 1>and with time they are demanding a </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger and larger international </v>

17
00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:52.094
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Putin's Russia has started to feel </v>

18
00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:55.610
<v Speaker 1>concerned by the Pacific hands.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

19
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.780
<v Speaker 1>so as the United States,</v>

20
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.850
<v Speaker 1>this area is extremely important.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now on the other hands,</v>

21
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.703
<v Speaker 1>there are many disagreements between the</v>
<v Speaker 1>different countries in this region and </v>

22
00:01:06.591 --> 00:01:11.300
<v Speaker 1>it seems that lately they have been </v>
<v Speaker 1>looking for any reason to start a fight.</v>

23
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.820
<v Speaker 1>We can find all kinds of conflicts here </v>
<v Speaker 1>back in.</v>

24
00:01:13.821 --> 00:01:16.180
<v Speaker 1>I'll make territorial historical,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean China,</v>

25
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.300
<v Speaker 1>China's conflict with Vietnam here with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan over there,</v>

26
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.233
<v Speaker 1>and then there is India.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The situation with Taiwan and the </v>

27
00:01:22.131 --> 00:01:22.964
<v Speaker 1>problems between Japan and Russia,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not even considering the </v>

28
00:01:25.431 --> 00:01:26.264
<v Speaker 1>situation in Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean the list just grows longer and </v>

29
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.160
<v Speaker 1>longer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We own stalk about many of these,</v>

30
00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:35.690
<v Speaker 1>but today we're going to focus on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>sleeping giants and that's Japan.</v>

31
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:38.930
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

32
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.270
<v Speaker 3>Two nightmares of Japan.</v>

33
00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.730
<v Speaker 1>It is the world's third largest economy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but despite that,</v>

34
00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:46.564
<v Speaker 1>this country has a modest role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>international politics and it's been </v>

35
00:01:49.391 --> 00:01:51.310
<v Speaker 1>that way for the last few decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

36
00:01:51.311 --> 00:01:55.300
<v Speaker 1>the situation is changing particularly </v>
<v Speaker 1>for two reasons.</v>

37
00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.760
<v Speaker 1>China and North Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>

38
00:01:57.761 --> 00:02:00.190
<v Speaker 1>there is the emergence of China as a </v>
<v Speaker 1>superpower,</v>

39
00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.340
<v Speaker 1>but why does Japan care about that?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

40
00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.203
<v Speaker 1>basically because the emergence of China</v>
<v Speaker 1>has led to sets Max in Japan's regional </v>

41
00:02:07.991 --> 00:02:08.824
<v Speaker 1>influence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Both countries maintain a bit of </v>

42
00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:11.403
<v Speaker 1>conflict.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Over a small archipelago known as the </v>

43
00:02:13.061 --> 00:02:14.620
<v Speaker 1>Senkaku islands.</v>

44
00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:15.723
<v Speaker 3>Senkaku islands are abandoned,</v>
<v Speaker 3>but they're still a key area in the </v>

45
00:02:19.281 --> 00:02:22.160
<v Speaker 3>fishing industry,</v>
<v Speaker 3>be called large deposits,</v>

46
00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.203
<v Speaker 3>petrol and gas,</v>
<v Speaker 3>and there are also strategic in sea </v>

47
00:02:25.911 --> 00:02:26.744
<v Speaker 3>trade.</v>

48
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.973
<v Speaker 1>Just take a look at this chart to see </v>
<v Speaker 1>how the military budget of both </v>

49
00:02:30.501 --> 00:02:32.630
<v Speaker 1>countries has evolved in the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

50
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:33.493
<v Speaker 1>He'll give you a better understanding of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan is concerned about China's </v>

51
00:02:36.291 --> 00:02:41.291
<v Speaker 1>emergent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Second Zahn more recently there is North</v>

52
00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:44.493
<v Speaker 1>Korea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>How's it been obsessed for the last 20 </v>

53
00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:49.900
<v Speaker 1>years about developing unconventional </v>
<v Speaker 1>walk capacities.</v>

54
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.140
<v Speaker 1>These are mainly being its nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>capability for now.</v>

55
00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:56.770
<v Speaker 1>North Korea has managed to create it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Atomic bomb 30 Keela tons,</v>

56
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.760
<v Speaker 1>which is comparable,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do twice the bomb that was on her Russia</v>

57
00:02:59.761 --> 00:03:00.594
<v Speaker 1>map.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've also succeeded in making </v>

58
00:03:01.451 --> 00:03:04.480
<v Speaker 1>ballistic missiles which can reach not </v>
<v Speaker 1>only South Korea.</v>

59
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.940
<v Speaker 1>There's also Japan.</v>

60
00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:08.443
<v Speaker 3>March,</v>
<v Speaker 3>2017 North Korea launched for ballistic </v>

61
00:03:11.151 --> 00:03:16.151
<v Speaker 3>missiles and Japan's direction it was </v>
<v Speaker 3>successful and three out of four of them</v>

62
00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:17.323
<v Speaker 3>reached Japanese territorial waters,</v>
<v Speaker 3>less than 200 miles from the Japanese </v>

63
00:03:21.261 --> 00:03:21.900
<v Speaker 3>code</v>

64
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:22.733
<v Speaker 2>Si.</v>

65
00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.680
<v Speaker 1>All of this is producing a real </v>
<v Speaker 1>psychosis in Japan.</v>

66
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:27.603
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese government itself has </v>
<v Speaker 1>started to conduct evacuation drills in </v>

67
00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:34.480
<v Speaker 1>the event of a hypothetical attack and </v>
<v Speaker 1>does either distributed a detailed guide</v>

68
00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:35.314
<v Speaker 1>to explain how Japanese citizens should </v>
<v Speaker 1>respond to to a North Korean nuclear </v>

69
00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:41.170
<v Speaker 1>attack.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Tokyo says that people should have about</v>

70
00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.700
<v Speaker 1>10 minutes to react to that might be an </v>
<v Speaker 1>overestimation.</v>

71
00:03:44.701 --> 00:03:45.534
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

72
00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.770
<v Speaker 2>Ms.</v>
<v Speaker 2>May</v>

73
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.100
<v Speaker 3>not be detected as soon as it leaves </v>
<v Speaker 3>launchpad pending on the case.</v>

74
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.993
<v Speaker 3>The warnings and alarms might only sound</v>
<v Speaker 3>four or five minutes before a missile </v>

75
00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.313
<v Speaker 3>arrives.</v>

76
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.883
<v Speaker 1>With all of this going on,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we shouldn't be surprised to find out </v>

77
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:01.314
<v Speaker 1>that Japan is acquiring many nuclear </v>
<v Speaker 1>shelters as well as equipment for </v>

78
00:04:03.721 --> 00:04:06.750
<v Speaker 1>purifying the air,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which all designed to fight radiation as</v>

79
00:04:06.751 --> 00:04:08.280
<v Speaker 1>well as poisonous gas</v>

80
00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.100
<v Speaker 3>lobby the Japanese prime minister has </v>
<v Speaker 3>confirmed.</v>

81
00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.450
<v Speaker 3>North Korea also has the ability to </v>
<v Speaker 3>launch serin gas missiles,</v>

82
00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.550
<v Speaker 1>so ignoring whether the North Korean </v>
<v Speaker 1>threat is real on us.</v>

83
00:04:19.551 --> 00:04:24.350
<v Speaker 1>The reality is that China and North </v>
<v Speaker 1>Korea are perceived as being significant</v>

84
00:04:24.351 --> 00:04:25.184
<v Speaker 1>threats by Tokyo before explaining how </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country is planning to fight these </v>

85
00:04:28.881 --> 00:04:29.714
<v Speaker 1>threats.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Let's have a look at what has been the </v>

86
00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:34.490
<v Speaker 1>foundation of their defense policy in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the last few decades.</v>

87
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.360
<v Speaker 3>Pat a passivist country,</v>

88
00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.010
<v Speaker 1>Japan was one of the countries that lost</v>
<v Speaker 1>World War II.</v>

89
00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:46.933
<v Speaker 1>As a consequence of this defeats the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country had to establish a constitution </v>

90
00:04:49.971 --> 00:04:54.971
<v Speaker 1>in 1940 700 that constitution is still </v>
<v Speaker 1>enforced today in this constitution.</v>

91
00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.143
<v Speaker 1>It states that war and the use of force </v>
<v Speaker 1>is not to be used unless in self </v>

92
00:04:59.751 --> 00:05:00.584
<v Speaker 1>defense.</v>

93
00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.010
<v Speaker 3>Firing sincerely to an international </v>
<v Speaker 3>piece based on justice and order.</v>

94
00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.213
<v Speaker 3>The Japanese people forever renounced </v>
<v Speaker 3>war as a sovereign right of the nation </v>

95
00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.910
<v Speaker 3>in order to accomplish the aim of the </v>
<v Speaker 3>preceding paragraph,</v>

96
00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.200
<v Speaker 3>land,</v>
<v Speaker 3>sea,</v>

97
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.260
<v Speaker 3>and air forces as well as other war </v>
<v Speaker 3>potential will never be maintained.</v>

98
00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:23.120
<v Speaker 3>Article Nine of the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 3>Constitution.</v>

99
00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:27.310
<v Speaker 1>This means that at first the idea was </v>
<v Speaker 1>that Japan couldn't even have an army.</v>

100
00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.090
<v Speaker 1>The country protection was the </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsibility of the u s however,</v>

101
00:05:31.091 --> 00:05:35.290
<v Speaker 1>the Korean War and the tensions suffered</v>
<v Speaker 1>during the years of the Cold War changed</v>

102
00:05:35.291 --> 00:05:36.580
<v Speaker 1>everything.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All of a sudden,</v>

103
00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:37.414
<v Speaker 1>both Tokyo as well as Washington </v>
<v Speaker 1>understood it was essential to form a </v>

104
00:05:40.241 --> 00:05:41.074
<v Speaker 1>support force for the American army.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In case Japan and needed defense and </v>

105
00:05:44.531 --> 00:05:47.410
<v Speaker 1>that is how the Japanese self defense </v>
<v Speaker 1>forces were born.</v>

106
00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.280
<v Speaker 1>This is an army whose only possible </v>
<v Speaker 1>purpose is defense,</v>

107
00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:52.173
<v Speaker 1>but one thing is tree.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Formerly the U s still takes cat of </v>

108
00:05:55.301 --> 00:05:58.250
<v Speaker 1>Japan's protection and keeps more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>40,000</v>

109
00:05:58.251 --> 00:05:59.084
<v Speaker 1>soldiers deployed in the country and </v>
<v Speaker 1>also maintains some of its largest </v>

110
00:06:01.881 --> 00:06:04.580
<v Speaker 1>military bases in Japan.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a forced,</v>

111
00:06:04.581 --> 00:06:07.010
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that is co financed by the government of</v>

112
00:06:07.011 --> 00:06:07.844
<v Speaker 1>Japan itself.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could even say the Japan is the </v>

113
00:06:09.651 --> 00:06:12.740
<v Speaker 1>largest spearhead of the U S in Asia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

114
00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.640
<v Speaker 1>the new threats Japan perceives in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>region from China runs North Korea,</v>

115
00:06:16.670 --> 00:06:17.503
<v Speaker 1>of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan's and no longer be satisfied with </v>

116
00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:19.904
<v Speaker 1>this protection.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the big question is how is Japan </v>

117
00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:23.780
<v Speaker 1>responding to these threats?</v>

118
00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:29.080
<v Speaker 3>Are these new diplomacy?</v>

119
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:31.063
<v Speaker 1>It's the beginning with the Japanese </v>
<v Speaker 1>Prime Minister Shinzo all they has </v>

120
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:33.983
<v Speaker 1>started an unusual diplomatic race who </v>
<v Speaker 1>work against the growing influence of </v>

121
00:06:37.171 --> 00:06:38.010
<v Speaker 1>China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For now,</v>

122
00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:38.893
<v Speaker 1>he has managed to improve the country's </v>
<v Speaker 1>relations with South Korea and to </v>

123
00:06:41.221 --> 00:06:42.054
<v Speaker 1>strengthen its bonds with the u s and </v>
<v Speaker 1>even bridge the gap existing with </v>

124
00:06:44.791 --> 00:06:45.840
<v Speaker 1>Putin's Russia.</v>

125
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:46.803
<v Speaker 3>Japan maintains an intense dispute over </v>
<v Speaker 3>the sovereignty of a small archipelago </v>

126
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:52.203
<v Speaker 3>known as the Kuril islands,</v>
<v Speaker 3>which Russia claims is now under their </v>

127
00:06:55.091 --> 00:06:55.840
<v Speaker 3>sovereignty.</v>

128
00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:57.290
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the diplomacy are,</v>

129
00:06:57.291 --> 00:06:58.124
<v Speaker 1>they has started is so intense that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is now competing with China in </v>

130
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:02.313
<v Speaker 1>Africa,</v>

131
00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:05.430
<v Speaker 3>Japan and China Compete for African </v>
<v Speaker 3>market.</v>

132
00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:06.793
<v Speaker 1>I'm just a curious fact.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Shinzo all bay was also the first </v>

133
00:07:08.631 --> 00:07:09.464
<v Speaker 1>international leader to meet with trump </v>
<v Speaker 1>and the famous residents the American </v>

134
00:07:12.201 --> 00:07:13.034
<v Speaker 1>President owns in Florida.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It seems like after this encounter all </v>

135
00:07:16.871 --> 00:07:17.704
<v Speaker 1>bay manage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you win over the president's and </v>

136
00:07:18.711 --> 00:07:19.544
<v Speaker 1>Macon?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Forget all the attacks made against </v>

137
00:07:20.871 --> 00:07:25.490
<v Speaker 1>Japan when he was still a candidate for </v>
<v Speaker 1>the presidency because one thing is true</v>

138
00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.570
<v Speaker 1>from complained quite a lot about Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but you know,</v>

139
00:07:28.610 --> 00:07:29.690
<v Speaker 1>things can change.</v>

140
00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:35.210
<v Speaker 3>Made it to the security of Japan and all</v>
<v Speaker 3>areas under its administrative control.</v>

141
00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.420
<v Speaker 3>The friendship between our two peoples </v>
<v Speaker 3>runs a very,</v>

142
00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:39.530
<v Speaker 3>very deep,</v>

143
00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.530
<v Speaker 1>of course diplomacy is not always enough</v>

144
00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:48.740
<v Speaker 3>and we are.</v>

145
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.350
<v Speaker 1>And so finally we reached the key </v>
<v Speaker 1>points.</v>

146
00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:53.213
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese Self Defense Forces often </v>
<v Speaker 1>thought of as some sort of small bands </v>

147
00:07:56.401 --> 00:07:57.234
<v Speaker 1>of men,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but really nothing is further from the </v>

148
00:07:58.981 --> 00:07:59.814
<v Speaker 1>truth.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Japanese army is larger than the </v>

149
00:08:01.261 --> 00:08:04.170
<v Speaker 1>army of France and the UK combined.</v>

150
00:08:06.450 --> 00:08:07.830
<v Speaker 1>No,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is true that given their name,</v>

151
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:09.690
<v Speaker 1>you may not think that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>important,</v>

152
00:08:09.691 --> 00:08:12.450
<v Speaker 1>but the abilities and capacity of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>stream,</v>

153
00:08:12.451 --> 00:08:15.300
<v Speaker 1>Jami is impressive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many analysts,</v>

154
00:08:15.301 --> 00:08:17.460
<v Speaker 1>they are still the best army in all of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asia,</v>

155
00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:20.750
<v Speaker 1>although China certainly competes for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that top spot antidote.</v>

156
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:25.080
<v Speaker 1>Japan's investment in defense is quite </v>
<v Speaker 1>low with less than 1% of its GDP,</v>

157
00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:28.260
<v Speaker 1>but that is still a lot of money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Take a look at this.</v>

158
00:08:28.320 --> 00:08:33.090
<v Speaker 1>In 2016 Japan was the country with the </v>
<v Speaker 1>seventh highest spending on defense.</v>

159
00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:34.013
<v Speaker 1>In 2017 the governments will give,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the force is the largest budget in its </v>

160
00:08:37.591 --> 00:08:40.110
<v Speaker 1>history,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than 5 trillion yen,</v>

161
00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:44.880
<v Speaker 1>which is around $45 billion and of </v>
<v Speaker 1>course such a quantity in such a small,</v>

162
00:08:44.881 --> 00:08:45.714
<v Speaker 1>and by the way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very well trained army is enough for </v>

163
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:50.490
<v Speaker 1>them to acquire some of the most modern </v>
<v Speaker 1>systems available.</v>

164
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:51.383
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the f 35 the best American </v>

165
00:08:53.011 --> 00:08:54.870
<v Speaker 1>drones,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Zulu Pass aircraft,</v>

166
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.200
<v Speaker 1>or even the new fifth generation fighter</v>
<v Speaker 1>jets,</v>

167
00:08:58.230 --> 00:08:59.750
<v Speaker 1>which Mitsibushi is developing.</v>

168
00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:04.140
<v Speaker 1>Japan reveals the prototype of it's </v>
<v Speaker 1>splashed furtive fighters.</v>

169
00:09:04.290 --> 00:09:05.123
<v Speaker 1>The thing is that since all they became </v>
<v Speaker 1>prime minister in 2012 he has had to </v>

170
00:09:08.001 --> 00:09:08.834
<v Speaker 1>declare idea of leaving behind the </v>
<v Speaker 1>pacifist character sent by the Japanese </v>

171
00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:14.573
<v Speaker 1>Constitution Ams.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This has happened in 2014 the Chinese </v>

172
00:09:16.231 --> 00:09:17.064
<v Speaker 1>government decided to stop all </v>
<v Speaker 1>restrictions on the export of warfare </v>

173
00:09:19.830 --> 00:09:20.663
<v Speaker 1>material with the goal of starting a new</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japanese military industry a bit later </v>

174
00:09:24.391 --> 00:09:25.224
<v Speaker 1>in 2015 are they all say ladder reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So for the self defense forces could </v>

175
00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:33.951
<v Speaker 1>operate abroad and today they even have </v>
<v Speaker 1>a military base in Djibouti brands.</v>

176
00:09:35.531 --> 00:09:37.620
<v Speaker 1>Of course the military budget has </v>
<v Speaker 1>increased again,</v>

177
00:09:37.621 --> 00:09:40.260
<v Speaker 1>often many years of budget cuts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but not only this,</v>

178
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.590
<v Speaker 1>they aren't even thinking about changing</v>
<v Speaker 1>the constitution.</v>

179
00:09:44.730 --> 00:09:49.730
<v Speaker 1>The radical military shift of Japan </v>
<v Speaker 1>echoes the ghost of World War Two so now</v>

180
00:09:51.541 --> 00:09:53.940
<v Speaker 1>it comes to the point in the video where</v>
<v Speaker 1>we ask what you think.</v>

181
00:09:53.941 --> 00:09:56.370
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Japan should leave?</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's pacifism aside,</v>

182
00:09:56.490 --> 00:09:59.090
<v Speaker 1>should Japan given to Beijing?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Which country?</v>

183
00:09:59.091 --> 00:10:02.220
<v Speaker 1>He seems like a better ally for you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan or China?</v>
