1
00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.263
<v Speaker 1>It's so good just for one week,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one week was really all the time that </v>

2
00:00:11.221 --> 00:00:12.054
<v Speaker 1>was needed for this man.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The president of the United States stab </v>

3
00:00:14.721 --> 00:00:18.870
<v Speaker 1>his first diplomatic crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So who was this crisis with?</v>

4
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:19.823
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can probably guess the answer is </v>

5
00:00:21.331 --> 00:00:22.950
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>

6
00:00:22.951 --> 00:00:25.260
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is the new China.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is killing us.</v>

7
00:00:25.261 --> 00:00:28.950
<v Speaker 1>The country of Mexico is killing us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Donald trump is well,</v>

8
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:29.843
<v Speaker 1>let's say unique.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He might be the only head of state </v>

9
00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:34.950
<v Speaker 1>capable of defying in public a foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents in this case.</v>

10
00:00:34.951 --> 00:00:35.950
<v Speaker 1>That's opinion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yet though,</v>

11
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.833
<v Speaker 1>like telling him on twitter if doesn't </v>
<v Speaker 1>travel to Washington with the idea of </v>

12
00:00:39.751 --> 00:00:42.480
<v Speaker 1>paying for the wall,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he may as well stay at home.</v>

13
00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.180
<v Speaker 1>Needless to say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the visit never happens.</v>

14
00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:50.310
<v Speaker 1>Live Travis Mikiko,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but don't worry.</v>

15
00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:51.864
<v Speaker 1>View as we've had enough trump talk to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the donald is not going to be the main </v>

16
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:55.794
<v Speaker 1>character in this video.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Today we're going to focus on the Nafta </v>

17
00:00:58.411 --> 00:00:59.244
<v Speaker 1>agreement and especially on the </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship between Mexico and the </v>

18
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.973
<v Speaker 1>United States of America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Laughter is a free trade agreements </v>

19
00:01:09.741 --> 00:01:11.060
<v Speaker 1>between the US,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>

20
00:01:11.061 --> 00:01:14.540
<v Speaker 1>and Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was negotiated by President George H,</v>

21
00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:15.374
<v Speaker 1>w Bush in 1992,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it was ratified and implemented by </v>

22
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.120
<v Speaker 1>Bill Clinton in 1995.</v>

23
00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.023
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

24
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.190
<v Speaker 1>Nafta has been supported both by </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democrats and the Republicans,</v>

25
00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.770
<v Speaker 1>but let's take a look back and analyze </v>
<v Speaker 1>which events took place.</v>

26
00:01:32.771 --> 00:01:34.120
<v Speaker 1>South of the Bravo Riverton.</v>

27
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.993
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

28
00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.550
<v Speaker 1>let's travel back and tell him to the 19</v>
<v Speaker 1>eighties.</v>

29
00:01:38.551 --> 00:01:41.250
<v Speaker 1>It's telling.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When Mexico was exhausted,</v>

30
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.143
<v Speaker 1>the country's economic model was a worn </v>
<v Speaker 1>out closed economy and they were in a </v>

31
00:01:45.331 --> 00:01:46.950
<v Speaker 1>state of crisis.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

32
00:01:46.951 --> 00:01:47.784
<v Speaker 1>it was a dance hall.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Him with a massive immigration from </v>

33
00:01:49.471 --> 00:01:53.970
<v Speaker 1>Mexico to the US started to happen and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't just any migratory wave.</v>

34
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.870
<v Speaker 1>It was one of the biggest migration </v>
<v Speaker 1>waves of all time</v>

35
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.093
<v Speaker 1>and all of this happens in a time when </v>
<v Speaker 1>Americans weren't particularly liked in </v>

36
00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:16.340
<v Speaker 1>Mexico since the war with the US from </v>
<v Speaker 1>easy 46 to 18,</v>

37
00:02:16.341 --> 00:02:19.610
<v Speaker 1>48 when Mexico lost more than half of </v>
<v Speaker 1>its territory.</v>

38
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.473
<v Speaker 1>The popular sentiment in the country was</v>
<v Speaker 1>that the US was a great villain and an </v>

39
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.790
<v Speaker 1>enemy that Mexico was facing by 1988.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was clear that Mexico is closed.</v>

40
00:02:28.791 --> 00:02:31.070
<v Speaker 1>System was worn out and the president of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico,</v>

41
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.610
<v Speaker 1>who at the time was Carlos Salinas,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a Harvard graduate by the way,</v>

42
00:02:34.611 --> 00:02:35.444
<v Speaker 1>decided to end this and opted for </v>
<v Speaker 1>opening up Mexico to the outside world </v>

43
00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.700
<v Speaker 1>in his own words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the US is not the worst threat that have</v>

44
00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:43.534
<v Speaker 1>the best opportunity and the leaders in </v>
<v Speaker 1>North America decided they didn't want </v>

45
00:02:46.641 --> 00:02:49.730
<v Speaker 1>to waste this chops.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They got down to business and decided to</v>

46
00:02:49.731 --> 00:02:54.140
<v Speaker 1>bet on extending to Mexico a free trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>agreements that they had recently signed</v>

47
00:02:54.141 --> 00:02:56.870
<v Speaker 1>with Canada with this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nafta was born.</v>

48
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:57.763
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>relations between the U S and have </v>

49
00:02:59.561 --> 00:03:00.394
<v Speaker 1>expanded a great deal.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is estimated the trade between the </v>

50
00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.430
<v Speaker 1>two countries today exceeds half </v>
<v Speaker 1>$8,000,000,000,000.</v>

51
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.260
<v Speaker 1>Now a half a trillion,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is $500.</v>

52
00:03:08.261 --> 00:03:09.094
<v Speaker 1>Million dollars is quite a hard number </v>
<v Speaker 1>to get your head around in more </v>

53
00:03:11.831 --> 00:03:12.664
<v Speaker 1>relatable terms each minute.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So that means more than a million </v>

54
00:03:15.101 --> 00:03:17.840
<v Speaker 1>dollars worth of products crosses the </v>
<v Speaker 1>border of the U,</v>

55
00:03:17.841 --> 00:03:18.940
<v Speaker 1>s and Mexico,</v>

56
00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.690
<v Speaker 1>or to put it in a more international </v>
<v Speaker 1>context,</v>

57
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:28.573
<v Speaker 1>trade between the US and Mexico is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>equivalence of the Chilean economy and </v>

58
00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:34.910
<v Speaker 1>does more than the entire economy of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina.</v>

59
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.110
<v Speaker 1>The Gardens,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American President,</v>

60
00:03:36.111 --> 00:03:36.944
<v Speaker 1>Donald Trump threatens this agreement.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Sam does even considered putting an end </v>

61
00:03:39.441 --> 00:03:40.274
<v Speaker 1>to it because according to him,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is the worst agreements that the US </v>

62
00:03:42.831 --> 00:03:43.664
<v Speaker 1>has ever signed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nafta is the worst trade deal ever </v>

63
00:03:47.181 --> 00:03:48.014
<v Speaker 1>signed anywhere,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but certainly ever signed in this </v>

64
00:03:49.251 --> 00:03:50.084
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now that's just what he says and the </v>

65
00:03:51.231 --> 00:03:52.060
<v Speaker 1>reality.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

66
00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.920
<v Speaker 1>bits rob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The difference after has in general been</v>

67
00:03:54.921 --> 00:03:57.320
<v Speaker 1>something of a goldmine for the United </v>
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>

68
00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.610
<v Speaker 1>It has been said that whenever trump has</v>
<v Speaker 1>a nightmare,</v>

69
00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.060
<v Speaker 1>it's always the same thing he sees and </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexicans stealing.</v>

70
00:04:10.061 --> 00:04:15.061
<v Speaker 1>Here's what your company anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we don't know if this is true bits,</v>

71
00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:16.563
<v Speaker 1>probably nice,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it would explain his obsession with </v>

72
00:04:18.431 --> 00:04:21.240
<v Speaker 1>Mexico and also why whenever he thinks </v>
<v Speaker 1>of Nafta,</v>

73
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.220
<v Speaker 1>he thinks of the American people getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>robbed,</v>

74
00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.520
<v Speaker 1>but zone thing that it is only the </v>
<v Speaker 1>president you holds in his opinion,</v>

75
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.403
<v Speaker 1>they need defenders of protectionism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In the US stated that Mexican and </v>

76
00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:36.340
<v Speaker 1>Canadian workers are causing American </v>
<v Speaker 1>jobs to disappear because of free trade.</v>

77
00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.400
<v Speaker 1>Specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they claimed that imports exceed exports</v>

78
00:04:39.401 --> 00:04:41.410
<v Speaker 1>by almost $80,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion dollars,</v>

79
00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.323
<v Speaker 1>and that's a lot of money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is that these figures </v>

80
00:04:45.221 --> 00:04:48.160
<v Speaker 1>are about as reliable as a chocolate </v>
<v Speaker 1>teapot.</v>

81
00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:49.023
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are two goods that twists those </v>

82
00:04:50.321 --> 00:04:52.570
<v Speaker 1>numbers which have nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>Nafta,</v>

83
00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:53.523
<v Speaker 1>petrol and natural gas.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And this is really important because if </v>

84
00:04:56.591 --> 00:04:57.424
<v Speaker 1>we don't consider those products that </v>
<v Speaker 1>treat all that trump is talking about </v>

85
00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:01.690
<v Speaker 1>pretty much disappears.</v>

86
00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.210
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>some of you are probably thinking,</v>

87
00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.900
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Simon,</v>

88
00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:13.600
<v Speaker 1>why wouldn't you consider petrol and </v>
<v Speaker 1>natural gas?</v>

89
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.310
<v Speaker 1>And that's a good question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

90
00:05:15.311 --> 00:05:19.210
<v Speaker 1>that's because unless trump wants to </v>
<v Speaker 1>take the United States back to the Stone</v>

91
00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:20.043
<v Speaker 1>Age,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he will have to keep getting all the </v>

92
00:05:21.011 --> 00:05:23.690
<v Speaker 1>petrol the country needs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether that's from Mexico,</v>

93
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:25.120
<v Speaker 1>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Saudi Arabia,</v>

94
00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:26.380
<v Speaker 1>Orwell,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well anywhere else,</v>

95
00:05:26.381 --> 00:05:28.420
<v Speaker 1>but these budget figures aren't the only</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones.</v>

96
00:05:28.421 --> 00:05:31.240
<v Speaker 1>The protection is dreamers also fudged </v>
<v Speaker 1>the biggest for.</v>

97
00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.420
<v Speaker 1>They also do this by not considering </v>
<v Speaker 1>service businesses.</v>

98
00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:36.670
<v Speaker 1>This includes things like the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>

99
00:05:36.671 --> 00:05:38.320
<v Speaker 1>the insurance sector,</v>
<v Speaker 1>traveling,</v>

100
00:05:38.321 --> 00:05:39.490
<v Speaker 1>consulting,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Internet,</v>

101
00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.270
<v Speaker 1>etc. And etc. Etc.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But ignoring these things is like sAying</v>

102
00:05:43.271 --> 00:05:46.840
<v Speaker 1>the banks don't make money and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>google simply doesn't exist.</v>

103
00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:51.310
<v Speaker 1>So if we adjust these two figures,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it turns out that the us' results is not</v>

104
00:05:51.311 --> 00:05:52.144
<v Speaker 1>a deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's actually a surplus that's true </v>

105
00:05:54.071 --> 00:05:55.960
<v Speaker 1>for both Mexico runs,</v>
<v Speaker 1>whether it's Canada,</v>

106
00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:58.750
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a surplus of more than $40</v>
<v Speaker 1>billion</v>

107
00:05:58.810 --> 00:05:59.643
<v Speaker 2>donuts.</v>

108
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:04.703
<v Speaker 1>The americans are really the ones who </v>
<v Speaker 1>are making off like bandits in this </v>

109
00:06:07.441 --> 00:06:08.880
<v Speaker 1>trade relationship.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All right,</v>

110
00:06:08.881 --> 00:06:12.030
<v Speaker 1>but in mExico it's a bit different </v>
<v Speaker 1>because even correcting the numbers,</v>

111
00:06:12.031 --> 00:06:14.820
<v Speaker 1>the us still gets the deficits in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

112
00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.670
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what is the actual number?</v>

113
00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:18.900
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>waiver,</v>

114
00:06:18.901 --> 00:06:19.734
<v Speaker 1>it's approximately in drum roll.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Please zero point five percent of its </v>

115
00:06:24.361 --> 00:06:25.740
<v Speaker 1>gdp.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

116
00:06:25.741 --> 00:06:28.650
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry to disappoint you.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is really that missile.</v>

117
00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:30.630
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the deficit is actually smaller than the</v>

118
00:06:30.631 --> 00:06:32.880
<v Speaker 1>one they have with China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Japan or Germany.</v>

119
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:40.463
<v Speaker 1>Almost all american industries export to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico more than the emBossed with the </v>

120
00:06:44.191 --> 00:06:45.024
<v Speaker 1>exception of autism.</v>

121
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.780
<v Speaker 1>You can guess where the profits are </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to end up,</v>

122
00:06:58.840 --> 00:06:59.673
<v Speaker 1>but there is more.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It is said that the main reason for the </v>

123
00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:05.110
<v Speaker 1>company's moving that factories to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is because the wages are lower,</v>

124
00:07:05.111 --> 00:07:08.950
<v Speaker 1>but that's only half the truth and </v>
<v Speaker 1>certainly isn't the main reason.</v>

125
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:09.813
<v Speaker 1>What's interesting about Mexico for car </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies is that Mexico has many more </v>

126
00:07:13.151 --> 00:07:13.984
<v Speaker 1>free trade agreements with other </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries than the us does and this </v>

127
00:07:16.421 --> 00:07:17.254
<v Speaker 1>allows them to produce and sell their </v>
<v Speaker 1>cars in other markets like Brazil and </v>

128
00:07:19.811 --> 00:07:23.140
<v Speaker 1>the european union without terrorists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which saves them a lot of money.</v>

129
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:24.930
<v Speaker 1>About $700,000,000 a year.</v>

130
00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.350
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

131
00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.250
<v Speaker 1>The benefits of these operations getting</v>
<v Speaker 1>to end dump.</v>

132
00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.360
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Once again,</v>

133
00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.120
<v Speaker 1>back in the pockets of the United States</v>
<v Speaker 1>of America,</v>

134
00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:39.990
<v Speaker 1>john salon cabins with casinos.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The house always wins,</v>

135
00:07:40.050 --> 00:07:40.883
<v Speaker 1>so thanks to Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Car companies in the usa are more </v>

136
00:07:43.081 --> 00:07:45.030
<v Speaker 1>competitive and to have more profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

137
00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:47.510
<v Speaker 1>consumers in America combine much </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper.</v>

138
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:51.943
<v Speaker 1>All of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>americans have more money to go to the </v>

139
00:07:53.421 --> 00:07:55.040
<v Speaker 1>senator,</v>
<v Speaker 1>to buy clothes,</v>

140
00:07:55.041 --> 00:07:55.874
<v Speaker 1>to change their small phones more often </v>
<v Speaker 1>and take part in all that consumer </v>

141
00:07:58.371 --> 00:07:59.204
<v Speaker 1>spending that we all love so much.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This all makes the economic wheels spin </v>

142
00:08:02.491 --> 00:08:03.324
<v Speaker 1>them faster.</v>

143
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:04.983
<v Speaker 2>Boss</v>

144
00:08:11.460 --> 00:08:12.820
<v Speaker 1>now probably seems to you,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

145
00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:15.230
<v Speaker 1>Mexico is actually pretty important to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the usa,</v>

146
00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:16.093
<v Speaker 1>but imagine the other way round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Almost 80 percent of mexican exports </v>

147
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:20.293
<v Speaker 1>ends up in northern neighbor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it's no surprise that the threat of </v>

148
00:08:22.971 --> 00:08:23.804
<v Speaker 1>the ends of nafta has reminded many of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the famous quotes attributed to </v>

149
00:08:26.121 --> 00:08:27.290
<v Speaker 1>porfirio,</v>
<v Speaker 1>diaz,</v>

150
00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:28.363
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's so far from god and so near the </v>

151
00:08:30.621 --> 00:08:31.454
<v Speaker 1>usa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nafta has been incredibly positive than </v>

152
00:08:33.291 --> 00:08:34.730
<v Speaker 1>Mexico.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As a quick example,</v>

153
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:37.340
<v Speaker 1>do you know which is the biggest </v>
<v Speaker 1>employer in Mexico?</v>

154
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:38.413
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's</v>

155
00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:42.750
<v Speaker 2>unfortunately really</v>

156
00:08:42.750 --> 00:08:43.583
<v Speaker 1>this huge investment by us companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>hasn't actually given the growth that </v>

157
00:08:46.261 --> 00:08:48.150
<v Speaker 1>was expected and for the reason for </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

158
00:08:48.151 --> 00:08:52.230
<v Speaker 1>so we need to look at responsibility </v>
<v Speaker 1>inside Mexico itself.</v>

159
00:08:52.290 --> 00:08:53.123
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the truth is the mexican politicians </v>

160
00:08:54.091 --> 00:08:54.924
<v Speaker 1>don't know how to advantaGe of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fantastic opportunity to make Mexico </v>

161
00:08:58.351 --> 00:08:59.184
<v Speaker 1>more modern and more competitive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and does he know bad politics equals </v>

162
00:09:02.521 --> 00:09:02.950
<v Speaker 1>bad,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right</v>

163
00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:03.980
<v Speaker 2>results.</v>

164
00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:12.010
<v Speaker 1>All of this means that Mexico has to </v>
<v Speaker 1>kneel in front of Donald Trump.</v>

165
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:13.080
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sesame,</v>

166
00:09:13.090 --> 00:09:13.923
<v Speaker 1>not</v>

167
00:09:18.870 --> 00:09:19.470
<v Speaker 2>Donald Trump,</v>

168
00:09:19.470 --> 00:09:21.990
<v Speaker 1>threatens Mexico with high tariffs on </v>
<v Speaker 1>their products.</v>

169
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.780
<v Speaker 1>If they refuse to pay for the wall to be</v>
<v Speaker 1>specific,</v>

170
00:09:24.781 --> 00:09:25.614
<v Speaker 1>trump's administration is threatened.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A 20 percent tariff increase for </v>

171
00:09:28.621 --> 00:09:31.170
<v Speaker 1>starters weld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be illegal.</v>

172
00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:32.033
<v Speaker 1>There are rules in the world trade </v>
<v Speaker 1>organization that prevent this from </v>

173
00:09:34.141 --> 00:09:34.974
<v Speaker 1>happening.</v>
<v Speaker 1>One of these is known as the most </v>

174
00:09:36.271 --> 00:09:37.104
<v Speaker 1>favored nation,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that one member of the wto </v>

175
00:09:39.151 --> 00:09:41.340
<v Speaker 1>cannot discriminate against another,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

176
00:09:41.341 --> 00:09:44.340
<v Speaker 1>to this means that the maximum tariff </v>
<v Speaker 1>would be limited to three percent in the</v>

177
00:09:44.341 --> 00:09:45.174
<v Speaker 1>case that nafta were abolished.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This would be a tax for consumers and </v>

178
00:09:47.911 --> 00:09:51.630
<v Speaker 1>american companies and wouldn't affect </v>
<v Speaker 1>the trade between the two nations,</v>

179
00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:52.493
<v Speaker 1>but even if the u s with the approval of</v>
<v Speaker 1>congress were willing to ignore </v>

180
00:09:55.321 --> 00:09:58.950
<v Speaker 1>international law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico has enough resources to fight and</v>

181
00:09:58.951 --> 00:09:59.784
<v Speaker 1>try and stop this first at Mexico would </v>
<v Speaker 1>be able to take advantage of the </v>

182
00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.790
<v Speaker 1>influence of the multinational </v>
<v Speaker 1>corporations operating in Mexico,</v>

183
00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:06.653
<v Speaker 1>which could stand to lose billions of </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars and this is not just the </v>

184
00:10:09.331 --> 00:10:12.840
<v Speaker 1>influence of a few rich men were talking</v>
<v Speaker 1>about all of these companies,</v>

185
00:10:12.841 --> 00:10:13.674
<v Speaker 1>workers and their shareholders as well </v>
<v Speaker 1>as millions of individual savers </v>

186
00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:19.410
<v Speaker 1>throughout the United States and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>second reason,</v>

187
00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.310
<v Speaker 1>well relations between Mexico and theu ,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s on just commercial immigration,</v>

188
00:10:23.311 --> 00:10:24.660
<v Speaker 1>drug trafficking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism.</v>

189
00:10:24.690 --> 00:10:27.060
<v Speaker 1>TheSe are just a few aspects of that </v>
<v Speaker 1>relationship.</v>

190
00:10:27.090 --> 00:10:30.030
<v Speaker 1>If trump attacks economically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mexico could find back,</v>

191
00:10:30.031 --> 00:10:30.864
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by letting the us drown in drugs and </v>

192
00:10:32.881 --> 00:10:36.090
<v Speaker 1>immigration waves from countries all </v>
<v Speaker 1>across latin America.</v>

193
00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.953
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that the u,</v>
<v Speaker 1>s and Mexico need each other more than </v>

194
00:10:39.661 --> 00:10:40.494
<v Speaker 1>it seems,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and Mexico is not seen as weak of a </v>

195
00:10:42.061 --> 00:10:42.894
<v Speaker 1>position as trump thinks.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the president is in Mexico is </v>

196
00:10:45.301 --> 00:10:46.134
<v Speaker 1>unpredictable.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It does look like he understands this </v>

197
00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:50.040
<v Speaker 1>and the message from his government is </v>
<v Speaker 1>clear.</v>

198
00:10:50.070 --> 00:10:52.950
<v Speaker 1>Let's talk about nafta.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We can renegotiate this treaty,</v>

199
00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:53.813
<v Speaker 1>but then all these other treaties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so we're also going to be open to </v>

200
00:10:55.681 --> 00:10:56.514
<v Speaker 1>negotiation.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's like this is what we think's going </v>

201
00:10:57.901 --> 00:10:59.490
<v Speaker 1>to happen here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a visual politic,</v>

202
00:10:59.491 --> 00:11:02.400
<v Speaker 1>and we'd love to know what you think.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Mexico should defend itself</v>

203
00:11:02.401 --> 00:11:03.234
<v Speaker 1>tooth and nail even with the risk of </v>
<v Speaker 1>triggering a trade war with the United </v>

204
00:11:06.210 --> 00:11:07.043
<v Speaker 1>States,</v>
<v Speaker 1>or do you think the nation should be </v>

205
00:11:07.291 --> 00:11:10.590
<v Speaker 1>patient to let things go and look for a </v>
<v Speaker 1>solution elsewhere?</v>
