1
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:08.903
<v Speaker 1>Does he know there is a country in South</v>
<v Speaker 1>America when most of its population are </v>

2
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:15.780
<v Speaker 1>of Indian origin and where the official </v>
<v Speaker 1>language is English.</v>

3
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.513
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you don't know which country I'm </v>

4
00:00:21.421 --> 00:00:22.254
<v Speaker 1>talking about,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry because this is one of the </v>

5
00:00:24.061 --> 00:00:26.910
<v Speaker 1>least known countries in the region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and to be fair,</v>

6
00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:29.880
<v Speaker 1>the media doesn't really pay that much </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention to it,</v>

7
00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.850
<v Speaker 1>so really small as a country that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>media don't talk about very much.</v>

8
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.210
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that sounds like the perfect ingredients</v>

9
00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:36.044
<v Speaker 1>for a visual politic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Talking about Guyana that owns British </v>

10
00:00:43.241 --> 00:00:46.870
<v Speaker 1>colony,</v>
<v Speaker 1>who didn't get independence until 1966.</v>

11
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:49.120
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly at the moment of </v>
<v Speaker 1>independence,</v>

12
00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.013
<v Speaker 1>both the government's [inaudible] </v>
<v Speaker 1>popular opinion was generally in favor </v>

13
00:00:52.811 --> 00:00:55.840
<v Speaker 1>of turning guy on it into a socialist </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

14
00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.030
<v Speaker 1>It was this mindset which gave the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>

15
00:00:58.031 --> 00:01:02.440
<v Speaker 1>It's Pinto ask official name,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Cooperative Republic of Guyana,</v>

16
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.500
<v Speaker 1>but let's focus on the country today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Diana is one of the poorest countries in</v>

17
00:01:07.601 --> 00:01:08.434
<v Speaker 1>South America and violence rates that </v>
<v Speaker 1>are some of the highest in the entire </v>

18
00:01:15.901 --> 00:01:18.300
<v Speaker 1>region,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and that's saying a lot.</v>

19
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.480
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if going on,</v>

20
00:01:19.481 --> 00:01:20.314
<v Speaker 1>it is known for anything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it would be for its place in the </v>

21
00:01:22.051 --> 00:01:24.660
<v Speaker 1>international supply of cocaine.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

22
00:01:24.661 --> 00:01:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and also for having one of the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>suicide rates in the world,</v>

23
00:01:27.721 --> 00:01:30.540
<v Speaker 1>so not exactly brilliant things.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

24
00:01:30.541 --> 00:01:31.374
<v Speaker 1>with all of this information,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you'd be forgiven for not being </v>

25
00:01:33.421 --> 00:01:36.780
<v Speaker 1>optimistic about the future of this </v>
<v Speaker 1>Caribbean country,</v>

26
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.110
<v Speaker 1>but they may be about to get a lot </v>
<v Speaker 1>luckier.</v>

27
00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.690
<v Speaker 1>Oh yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Signs pointed to.</v>

28
00:01:47.691 --> 00:01:48.524
<v Speaker 1>Guiana becoming an oil power for there's</v>
<v Speaker 1>only being this small republic with a </v>

29
00:01:51.921 --> 00:01:52.754
<v Speaker 1>population of about 750,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>inhabitants has already got the </v>

30
00:01:56.031 --> 00:02:00.160
<v Speaker 1>attention and dollars of multinational </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies such as Exxon or</v>

31
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.750
<v Speaker 2>that's</v>

32
00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:08.110
<v Speaker 1>after several years exploring the area.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On January the 13th,</v>

33
00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:08.944
<v Speaker 1>2017 things to powerful oil companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>announced the discovery of water they </v>

34
00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:14.223
<v Speaker 1>think could be one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>significant oil and gas reserves found </v>

35
00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:18.813
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oil reserves have been found in deep </v>

36
00:02:20.681 --> 00:02:21.514
<v Speaker 1>waters in the scene.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Menzel under the coastal waters of </v>

37
00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:28.000
<v Speaker 1>Deanna early calculations estimate that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the amount of oil which can be exploited</v>

38
00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:28.834
<v Speaker 1>in the country is no less than 4,000</v>
<v Speaker 1>million barrels and many experts from </v>

39
00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.563
<v Speaker 1>this could be a much larger quantity,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so it seems that this country holds a </v>

40
00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:39.124
<v Speaker 1>huge fortune just off it's shores.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the question really is how much </v>

41
00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.690
<v Speaker 1>is this all really worth considering the</v>
<v Speaker 1>price of oil nowadays,</v>

42
00:02:46.691 --> 00:02:50.170
<v Speaker 1>we're talking about roughly </v>
<v Speaker 1>$200,000,000,000,</v>

43
00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>so leaving other natural resources </v>
<v Speaker 1>asides and considering only petrol.</v>

44
00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.300
<v Speaker 1>This would result in the equivalent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>$250,000</v>

45
00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.163
<v Speaker 1>per citizen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's important to note that the oil </v>

46
00:03:00.971 --> 00:03:03.750
<v Speaker 1>reserves can be much bigger than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>early calculations in.</v>

47
00:03:03.751 --> 00:03:04.584
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

48
00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.170
<v Speaker 2>no,</v>

49
00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:08.003
<v Speaker 1>it is true that oil exploitation is </v>
<v Speaker 1>expensive and requires enormous </v>

50
00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:12.474
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this could still be the first step </v>

51
00:03:14.461 --> 00:03:15.294
<v Speaker 1>in a new era of prosperity 40 on it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far of the oil companies I've </v>

52
00:03:19.291 --> 00:03:24.291
<v Speaker 1>mentioned Exxon mobile and has have </v>
<v Speaker 1>committed to investing $900,000,000</v>

53
00:03:24.511 --> 00:03:25.344
<v Speaker 1>a year in Ghana over the next few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government is investing to with </v>

54
00:03:28.861 --> 00:03:31.500
<v Speaker 1>plans to start exporting oil in 20,</v>
<v Speaker 1>20.</v>

55
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.363
<v Speaker 1>This means Guiana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it could be on the cusp of becoming one </v>

56
00:03:34.501 --> 00:03:38.670
<v Speaker 1>of the greatest economic developments </v>
<v Speaker 1>that South America has ever.</v>

57
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:47.230
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

58
00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.170
<v Speaker 1>Ghana,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that poor violence country.</v>

59
00:03:49.171 --> 00:03:50.004
<v Speaker 1>You could become the kinds of country </v>
<v Speaker 1>which other people in South America who </v>

60
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:56.320
<v Speaker 1>are unemployed might look at and think,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to change my life.</v>

61
00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>I once opportunities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to go to Ghana.</v>

62
00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:01.900
<v Speaker 1>Ghana could become that big hope for </v>
<v Speaker 1>many.</v>

63
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.410
<v Speaker 1>I'm employed South American people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>

64
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.980
<v Speaker 1>before they start packing a,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we have to say that it's not going to be</v>

65
00:04:08.981 --> 00:04:09.814
<v Speaker 1>that easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The road ahead is going to be fraught </v>

66
00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.700
<v Speaker 1>with difficulties.</v>

67
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.040
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

68
00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:18.530
<v Speaker 1>with Venezuela,</v>

69
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.040
<v Speaker 2>much better.</v>

70
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.873
<v Speaker 1>The oil exploration is happening in </v>
<v Speaker 1>areas that have been claimed by </v>

71
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:23.964
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela and is the part they have </v>
<v Speaker 1>claimed is not exactly small Madora who </v>

72
00:04:28.261 --> 00:04:30.450
<v Speaker 1>considers the region known as Guiana </v>
<v Speaker 1>asset.</v>

73
00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:31.293
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] burned to be vast and this </v>
<v Speaker 1>region represents more than 70 percent </v>

74
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:35.110
<v Speaker 1>of</v>

75
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:35.943
<v Speaker 2>surface,</v>

76
00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:38.773
<v Speaker 1>so essentially Venezuela is claiming the</v>
<v Speaker 1>entire country as their own and as if </v>

77
00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:43.664
<v Speaker 1>this wasn't bad enough and other area </v>
<v Speaker 1>which makes up seven percent of its </v>

78
00:04:46.311 --> 00:04:49.280
<v Speaker 1>territory is claimed by their neighbors </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Suriname.</v>

79
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.173
<v Speaker 1>If their neighbors had their way,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guiana would have been carved up and </v>

80
00:04:52.401 --> 00:04:53.234
<v Speaker 1>split between them a long time ago.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The thing is this conflict over </v>

81
00:04:56.421 --> 00:04:58.790
<v Speaker 1>territory seemed to have been forgotten </v>
<v Speaker 1>for years.</v>

82
00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:59.653
<v Speaker 1>This was likely a consequence of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>good relations that the government's </v>

83
00:05:02.061 --> 00:05:02.894
<v Speaker 1>kept with Cuba,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a country that holds a lot of influence </v>

84
00:05:05.121 --> 00:05:05.954
<v Speaker 1>over this part of the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was also likely because Venezuela </v>

85
00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.200
<v Speaker 1>wanted the support of organizations such</v>
<v Speaker 1>as Caricom,</v>

86
00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:17.360
<v Speaker 1>the Caribbean Community of which Guiana </v>
<v Speaker 1>is a member.</v>

87
00:05:17.361 --> 00:05:21.500
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is Agi on a Caribbean country or is it a</v>

88
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.030
<v Speaker 1>South American country?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

89
00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.640
<v Speaker 1>it's sort of both geographically </v>
<v Speaker 1>speaking,</v>

90
00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:29.060
<v Speaker 1>the country is in South America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but politically,</v>

91
00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.290
<v Speaker 1>culturally and socially speaking.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guiana is a Caribbean country.</v>

92
00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:34.213
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Guiana was one of the countries which </v>

93
00:05:35.691 --> 00:05:36.524
<v Speaker 1>used to benefits from petro an </v>
<v Speaker 1>initiative by Hugo Chavez that we're </v>

94
00:05:39.721 --> 00:05:40.554
<v Speaker 1>supplying cheap,</v>
<v Speaker 1>high quality oil to those countries </v>

95
00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:43.273
<v Speaker 1>which were deemed France,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it all changed when on May the 11th </v>

96
00:05:46.251 --> 00:05:47.084
<v Speaker 1>of 2005,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the left wing governments of the </v>

97
00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:50.743
<v Speaker 1>People's Progressive Party lost the </v>
<v Speaker 1>general election to a coalition headed </v>

98
00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:54.860
<v Speaker 1>by their new president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>David granger.</v>

99
00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:55.753
<v Speaker 1>A man who was closer to Washington and </v>
<v Speaker 1>who to end once and for all the claims </v>

100
00:05:59.571 --> 00:06:00.404
<v Speaker 1>coming from</v>

101
00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.293
<v Speaker 3>way less,</v>

102
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.983
<v Speaker 1>it was at that moment that the long </v>
<v Speaker 1>ignored conflict to defrost it and </v>

103
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:10.000
<v Speaker 1>things really started to heat up.</v>

104
00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.150
<v Speaker 3>It's still carrying a monkey on its </v>
<v Speaker 3>back.</v>

105
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:18.270
<v Speaker 3>That monkey is the unbearable burden of </v>
<v Speaker 3>an oppressive and obnoxious Cleveland on</v>

106
00:06:18.811 --> 00:06:20.100
<v Speaker 3>land and sea space.</v>

107
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.013
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the conflict is in the hands of the </v>

108
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.920
<v Speaker 1>United Nations,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but whatever the solution might be,</v>

109
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:25.813
<v Speaker 1>if there is any,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's important to be aware of this </v>

110
00:06:27.561 --> 00:06:30.520
<v Speaker 1>threat to the potential prosperous </v>
<v Speaker 1>future after gone.</v>

111
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.500
<v Speaker 2>Racial conflict.</v>

112
00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:40.330
<v Speaker 1>Important risk is the recurrence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Racial conflicts in Guyana,</v>

113
00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.240
<v Speaker 1>which is a continuous presence in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>countries media.</v>

114
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:47.080
<v Speaker 1>Deanna is a complex country </v>
<v Speaker 1>demographically around 50 percent of its</v>

115
00:06:47.081 --> 00:06:51.190
<v Speaker 1>population is of Indian origin,</v>
<v Speaker 1>while 40 percent is of African origin.</v>

116
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.760
<v Speaker 1>Those are two big groups who are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>exactly on the friendliest of terms.</v>

117
00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:02.460
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the black minority claims that for years</v>

118
00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:03.294
<v Speaker 1>the Indian majority has obtained </v>
<v Speaker 1>privileges from the government and </v>

119
00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:06.743
<v Speaker 1>always got that way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is triggered recurrence waves of </v>

120
00:07:08.911 --> 00:07:09.744
<v Speaker 1>violence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Luckily the situation seems to have </v>

121
00:07:11.371 --> 00:07:13.410
<v Speaker 1>improved.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact is the winning coalition,</v>

122
00:07:13.411 --> 00:07:15.070
<v Speaker 1>governments is quite multiracial.</v>

123
00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:20.233
<v Speaker 1>There is still the possibility that </v>
<v Speaker 1>further internal conflict will flare up </v>

124
00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.083
<v Speaker 1>in any case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>not only does this new governments have </v>

125
00:07:25.531 --> 00:07:27.900
<v Speaker 1>an opportunity to overcome decades of </v>
<v Speaker 1>conflict,</v>

126
00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:28.734
<v Speaker 1>it's once and for all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but it's also being looked to to find </v>

127
00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:31.553
<v Speaker 1>violence and corruption in the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that Ganas certainly needs to </v>

128
00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:35.903
<v Speaker 1>be one of the most corrupt countries in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world according to Transparency </v>

129
00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.313
<v Speaker 1>International.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the new government has quite a few </v>

130
00:07:41.191 --> 00:07:43.680
<v Speaker 1>major tasks ahead of them,</v>
<v Speaker 1>oil exploitation,</v>

131
00:07:43.681 --> 00:07:47.160
<v Speaker 1>as well as the fight against corruption </v>
<v Speaker 1>and criminality and the country.</v>

132
00:07:47.190 --> 00:07:49.350
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if they achieved their goals,</v>

133
00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.223
<v Speaker 1>Guiana will attract great attention and </v>
<v Speaker 1>me become one of the richest countries </v>

134
00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:54.713
<v Speaker 1>in South America,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but this will only be if they use their </v>

135
00:07:57.061 --> 00:08:00.450
<v Speaker 1>resources well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the question is will that happen?</v>

136
00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:04.140
<v Speaker 1>And it's certainly a big question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we've given you our opinion,</v>

137
00:08:04.141 --> 00:08:06.390
<v Speaker 1>here are visual politics and now we'd </v>
<v Speaker 1>love to know what you think.</v>

138
00:08:06.390 --> 00:08:10.110
<v Speaker 1>Do you think Guiana will successfully </v>
<v Speaker 1>take advantage of their newly discovered</v>

139
00:08:10.111 --> 00:08:12.930
<v Speaker 1>oil and what position do you think </v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuela should adopt?</v>
