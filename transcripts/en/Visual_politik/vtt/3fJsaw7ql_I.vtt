1
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:09.233
<v Speaker 1>In the last few years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile has become the Christiana Renaldo </v>

2
00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.243
<v Speaker 1>last in America.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It was the country with the highest </v>

3
00:00:14.071 --> 00:00:14.904
<v Speaker 1>growth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>had the most success and sticking with </v>

4
00:00:16.561 --> 00:00:17.394
<v Speaker 1>our metaphor here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it scored the most goals also for many </v>

5
00:00:19.801 --> 00:00:20.634
<v Speaker 1>classical liberals,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile has been the benchmark for years </v>

6
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.293
<v Speaker 1>we can say they considered the Chilean </v>
<v Speaker 1>models something of a dream in a world </v>

7
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.860
<v Speaker 1>full of dark nightmares,</v>

8
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.473
<v Speaker 1>and it was true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There were good reasons for celebration </v>

9
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:37.723
<v Speaker 1>Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which ones was the poorest Spanish </v>

10
00:00:38.961 --> 00:00:41.930
<v Speaker 1>country in Latin America became the </v>
<v Speaker 1>richest in the region.</v>

11
00:00:41.931 --> 00:00:42.764
<v Speaker 1>It became the country with the highest </v>
<v Speaker 1>life expectancy in the country with the </v>

12
00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.600
<v Speaker 1>best social services in the entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>region.</v>

13
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.270
<v Speaker 1>It is true that inequality is very high </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chile,</v>

14
00:00:50.271 --> 00:00:51.104
<v Speaker 1>but the entire population of Chile has </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefited from the prosperity that the </v>

15
00:00:53.901 --> 00:00:56.750
<v Speaker 1>country has achieved over the past few </v>
<v Speaker 1>decades.</v>

16
00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:58.143
<v Speaker 1>For the past 25 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the income of the poorest people in the </v>

17
00:01:00.411 --> 00:01:04.310
<v Speaker 1>country has increased far more than the </v>
<v Speaker 1>income of the wealthiest people as their</v>

18
00:01:04.311 --> 00:01:07.410
<v Speaker 1>purchasing power has grown six times </v>
<v Speaker 1>larger.</v>

19
00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.930
<v Speaker 1>All of this compares very favorably to </v>
<v Speaker 1>other Latin American nations.</v>

20
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.610
<v Speaker 1>As an example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 1950,</v>

21
00:01:13.611 --> 00:01:14.444
<v Speaker 1>the average income was around a third of</v>
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelan income in a manner of </v>

22
00:01:18.111 --> 00:01:20.870
<v Speaker 1>speaking and Venezuelans were three </v>
<v Speaker 1>times richer.</v>

23
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:21.763
<v Speaker 1>A lot has changed since then and today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chileans are much richer than </v>

24
00:01:25.161 --> 00:01:28.460
<v Speaker 1>Venezuelans.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They also have a longer life expectancy,</v>

25
00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.660
<v Speaker 1>hla and lives in average of eight years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more than a person born in Venezuela.</v>

26
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.990
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

27
00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.460
<v Speaker 1>Comparing Chile to Venezuela or </v>
<v Speaker 1>Argentina shore makes Chilean look good,</v>

28
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.640
<v Speaker 1>but when the comparison is made with </v>
<v Speaker 1>other more distant countries,</v>

29
00:01:44.641 --> 00:01:46.170
<v Speaker 1>for example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>those in Asia,</v>

30
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.320
<v Speaker 1>the figures aren't nearly so nice and </v>
<v Speaker 1>further.</v>

31
00:01:49.321 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>It seems as if the country has stopped </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing,</v>

32
00:01:51.511 --> 00:01:52.850
<v Speaker 1>which is certainly well,</v>

33
00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.753
<v Speaker 2>yes,</v>

34
00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.520
<v Speaker 3>the Chilean slow down</v>

35
00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.500
<v Speaker 1>last few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The optimism and success,</v>

36
00:02:03.501 --> 00:02:05.570
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's come to an end in San Diego,</v>

37
00:02:05.571 --> 00:02:08.810
<v Speaker 1>the capital of the country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the displays of wealth and prosperity of</v>

38
00:02:08.811 --> 00:02:12.620
<v Speaker 1>left making room instead for </v>
<v Speaker 1>demonstrations and protests,</v>

39
00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.470
<v Speaker 1>anger and despair have taken over and </v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

40
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.393
<v Speaker 1>it's only logical economic growth has </v>
<v Speaker 1>fallen for the last few years and in </v>

41
00:02:21.651 --> 00:02:22.484
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>unemployment increased while salaries </v>

42
00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.270
<v Speaker 1>remains frozen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>

43
00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:27.133
<v Speaker 1>the youth can't find jobs in both </v>
<v Speaker 1>investment and exports have fallen and </v>

44
00:02:30.201 --> 00:02:31.034
<v Speaker 1>the thing is that things aren't looking </v>
<v Speaker 1>like they're going to get any better </v>

45
00:02:33.411 --> 00:02:34.244
<v Speaker 1>anytime soon.</v>

46
00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.520
<v Speaker 3>Twenty 16,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the Chilean economy grew by one point,</v>

47
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:40.354
<v Speaker 3>five percent.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Truly central banks forecast for 2017 </v>

48
00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:43.803
<v Speaker 3>are not a whole lot better.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Increasing to two percent from one </v>

49
00:02:46.481 --> 00:02:47.314
<v Speaker 3>percent.</v>

50
00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.130
<v Speaker 1>Just want me to all of the growth of the</v>
<v Speaker 1>last decades.</v>

51
00:02:50.131 --> 00:02:54.120
<v Speaker 1>Three out of every four Chileans make </v>
<v Speaker 1>less than $700 a month,</v>

52
00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.430
<v Speaker 1>so now you can probably understand their</v>
<v Speaker 1>anger.</v>

53
00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.160
<v Speaker 1>These aren't the salaries that belonged </v>
<v Speaker 1>to a rich country,</v>

54
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.003
<v Speaker 1>so all in all,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Chilean model seems to be failing </v>

55
00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:04.510
<v Speaker 1>and there is one person who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>responsible for this slow down.</v>

56
00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.690
<v Speaker 1>And that's Miquel Baca.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's the current president of Chile.</v>

57
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:15.320
<v Speaker 3>Evolution of Bachelot Michelle</v>

58
00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.360
<v Speaker 1>backlash was the president of Chile for </v>
<v Speaker 1>March,</v>

59
00:03:17.361 --> 00:03:19.550
<v Speaker 1>2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>March 2010,</v>

60
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:23.420
<v Speaker 1>but essentially a president can be </v>
<v Speaker 1>elected to two consecutive terms,</v>

61
00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.283
<v Speaker 1>so bankers have to wait four years </v>
<v Speaker 1>before she could run again for Lamanita </v>

62
00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.930
<v Speaker 1>the name of the presidential palace in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile.</v>

63
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.793
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after gaining the support of almost all </v>

64
00:03:32.061 --> 00:03:32.894
<v Speaker 1>the left wing parties,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including the Socialist Party and the </v>

65
00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:36.463
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>won the elections in November of 2013 </v>

66
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:41.810
<v Speaker 1>and a few months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I'd been march of 2014,</v>

67
00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.150
<v Speaker 1>she became the president of the Republic</v>
<v Speaker 1>of Chile again</v>

68
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.123
<v Speaker 1>in the second time back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let decided to go through with reforms </v>

69
00:03:50.291 --> 00:03:51.124
<v Speaker 1>which were much more aggressive than the</v>
<v Speaker 1>ones she came up with at the time </v>

70
00:03:53.531 --> 00:03:54.364
<v Speaker 1>around.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her first decision was to increase </v>

71
00:03:55.751 --> 00:03:58.870
<v Speaker 1>taxation on companies by almost 40 </v>
<v Speaker 1>percent.</v>

72
00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:59.733
<v Speaker 1>Quite a dramatic move.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He did it by raising rates on profits </v>

73
00:04:02.381 --> 00:04:03.214
<v Speaker 1>and also by eliminating a bonus,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means companies could reduce </v>

74
00:04:05.891 --> 00:04:09.020
<v Speaker 1>taxation if the profits were reinvested </v>
<v Speaker 1>in Chile.</v>

75
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.420
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That was all about reinvestment,</v>

76
00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.910
<v Speaker 1>was actually a really reasonable </v>
<v Speaker 1>incentive.</v>

77
00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.250
<v Speaker 1>A country like China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is far from being rich,</v>

78
00:04:18.251 --> 00:04:19.870
<v Speaker 1>needs factories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>machines,</v>

79
00:04:19.871 --> 00:04:22.180
<v Speaker 1>businesses,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology and investments,</v>

80
00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:25.660
<v Speaker 1>and this incentive encouraged the growth</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all of these things.</v>

81
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.480
<v Speaker 1>So the question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>what's the point of publishing companies</v>

82
00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:29.314
<v Speaker 1>providing this much needed investments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And in addition to all of this taxation </v>

83
00:04:32.321 --> 00:04:34.660
<v Speaker 1>on companies wasn't exactly low.</v>
<v Speaker 1>To begin with,</v>

84
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.523
<v Speaker 1>take a look at how things are now off </v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco that has punished these </v>

85
00:04:37.811 --> 00:04:38.644
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

86
00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.563
<v Speaker 3>Chile has the second highest corporate </v>
<v Speaker 3>taxes in the world surpassed only by </v>

87
00:04:43.351 --> 00:04:44.184
<v Speaker 3>Japan,</v>
<v Speaker 3>a much richer country with much larger </v>

88
00:04:46.441 --> 00:04:47.274
<v Speaker 3>companies,</v>

89
00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:49.830
<v Speaker 1>and would you like to know the </v>
<v Speaker 1>consequences of this measure?</v>

90
00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.703
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>investment has fallen by 30 percent </v>

91
00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.630
<v Speaker 1>since backer lead came back to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidential palace and of course,</v>

92
00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.190
<v Speaker 1>less investment means ness job's less </v>
<v Speaker 1>growth and therefore less tax revenue.</v>

93
00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:03.190
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they decided to eat the cake before they</v>

94
00:05:03.191 --> 00:05:06.490
<v Speaker 1>could even bake us and weld.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That rarely works.</v>

95
00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:07.383
<v Speaker 1>That is why there has been a clear </v>
<v Speaker 1>international tendency to reduce </v>

96
00:05:09.971 --> 00:05:12.940
<v Speaker 1>taxation on companies over the last few </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

97
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:16.293
<v Speaker 3>Canada,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the UK and Ireland are some examples of </v>

98
00:05:19.271 --> 00:05:21.580
<v Speaker 3>countries where corporate taxes has been</v>
<v Speaker 3>reduced.</v>

99
00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.220
<v Speaker 3>The new president of France,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Emmanuel Macron,</v>

100
00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:26.770
<v Speaker 3>has also promised to reduce taxes</v>

101
00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:28.521
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>surely.</v>

102
00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:30.350
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's headed in the opposite direction,</v>

103
00:05:30.351 --> 00:05:33.980
<v Speaker 1>but do wait a second here because well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's not the other two main reforms.</v>

104
00:05:33.981 --> 00:05:34.814
<v Speaker 1>Bachelors is put through.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You have resulted in a very similar </v>

105
00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.233
<v Speaker 1>outcome.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Labor reform as made recruitment more </v>

106
00:05:39.861 --> 00:05:43.130
<v Speaker 1>expensive and has given more power to </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade unions.</v>

107
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.750
<v Speaker 1>Some,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I liked the sounds of this,</v>

108
00:05:44.751 --> 00:05:45.584
<v Speaker 1>but it means more costs for companies </v>
<v Speaker 1>which when added to the increase on </v>

109
00:05:48.171 --> 00:05:50.760
<v Speaker 1>taxation means there is even less </v>
<v Speaker 1>investments,</v>

110
00:05:50.761 --> 00:05:53.510
<v Speaker 1>less competition and less exports.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Essentially.</v>

111
00:05:53.511 --> 00:05:55.790
<v Speaker 1>All of this has caused,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well the whole lot of problems.</v>

112
00:05:55.791 --> 00:05:56.624
<v Speaker 1>On the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>tobacco ads tried to pass an ambitious </v>

113
00:05:58.101 --> 00:05:58.934
<v Speaker 1>reform.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you turn the private college </v>

114
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:03.050
<v Speaker 1>education system into a public free of </v>
<v Speaker 1>charge service?</v>

115
00:06:03.051 --> 00:06:05.030
<v Speaker 1>The problem is the visual politic view </v>
<v Speaker 1>of that.</v>

116
00:06:05.031 --> 00:06:05.864
<v Speaker 1>This model is very expensive and some </v>
<v Speaker 1>say the solution to the problems of </v>

117
00:06:08.871 --> 00:06:09.704
<v Speaker 1>education is to improve the quality of </v>
<v Speaker 1>the universities themselves instead of </v>

118
00:06:12.951 --> 00:06:15.320
<v Speaker 1>making them into factories,</v>
<v Speaker 1>printing deployments.</v>

119
00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:16.183
<v Speaker 1>But anyway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the thing is back in that couldn't pass </v>

120
00:06:17.451 --> 00:06:18.284
<v Speaker 1>this reform and in her attempt to do so,</v>
<v Speaker 1>she turns the whole education system </v>

121
00:06:21.891 --> 00:06:23.090
<v Speaker 1>upside down.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

122
00:06:23.091 --> 00:06:26.570
<v Speaker 1>she has reduced the amount of investment</v>
<v Speaker 1>that was plans to improve the quality of</v>

123
00:06:26.571 --> 00:06:28.280
<v Speaker 1>these universities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but okay,</v>

124
00:06:28.281 --> 00:06:29.870
<v Speaker 1>well now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

125
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.600
<v Speaker 1>what are the citizens of Chile?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Think about all of this.</v>

126
00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.160
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's look closely.</v>

127
00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:36.843
<v Speaker 3>Percent of Chileans believe that </v>
<v Speaker 3>Michelle Bachelet government must delay </v>

128
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:41.013
<v Speaker 3>or at least moderate some of the reforms</v>
<v Speaker 3>that have recently taken place in the </v>

129
00:06:44.411 --> 00:06:46.540
<v Speaker 3>country,</v>
<v Speaker 3>especially educational reform.</v>

130
00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:53.030
<v Speaker 1>It feels as if I was working towards an </v>
<v Speaker 1>ideological change rather than a formula</v>

131
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.520
<v Speaker 1>which could actually sold national </v>
<v Speaker 1>problems.</v>

132
00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:59.793
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all these reforms and the hostility </v>

133
00:07:00.821 --> 00:07:01.654
<v Speaker 1>towards private corporations have led to</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile to suffer the worst economic </v>

134
00:07:04.451 --> 00:07:05.284
<v Speaker 1>period for decades as well.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you know who is most negatively </v>

135
00:07:08.081 --> 00:07:09.880
<v Speaker 1>affected by the situation?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

136
00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:10.743
<v Speaker 1>that's the poor and the working class </v>
<v Speaker 1>after all the wealthy already have a </v>

137
00:07:13.571 --> 00:07:14.500
<v Speaker 1>good standard of living.</v>

138
00:07:17.270 --> 00:07:18.220
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

139
00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:20.770
<v Speaker 1>The thing is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>backlit leaves the country with a crisis</v>

140
00:07:20.771 --> 00:07:21.604
<v Speaker 1>with the growing public deficit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>with the highest public spending of the </v>

141
00:07:23.651 --> 00:07:26.740
<v Speaker 1>last 26 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and frankly with the damage to economy.</v>

142
00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:29.290
<v Speaker 1>But now that you know all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you might be wondering,</v>

143
00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.390
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>besides backlash,</v>

144
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:33.070
<v Speaker 1>one of the biggest weaknesses in Chile.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

145
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:33.933
<v Speaker 1>let's have a look.</v>

146
00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:41.430
<v Speaker 3>Chili's.</v>
<v Speaker 3>Weaknesses,</v>

147
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.343
<v Speaker 2>yes.</v>

148
00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:47.000
<v Speaker 1>The shelly doesn't like foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>

149
00:07:47.030 --> 00:07:47.863
<v Speaker 1>It's a bit strange for a country like </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chile because they seem to have been </v>

150
00:07:50.061 --> 00:07:52.610
<v Speaker 1>incapable of attracting foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>professionals.</v>

151
00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:55.700
<v Speaker 1>Immigration is only two percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and while that's a problem,</v>

152
00:07:55.701 --> 00:07:58.630
<v Speaker 1>because it affects entrepreneurship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>innovation and trait,</v>

153
00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:03.320
<v Speaker 3>why won't Chili grow?</v>
<v Speaker 3>Because it is full of Chileans.</v>

154
00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:08.390
<v Speaker 3>Ricardo Hausmann,</v>
<v Speaker 3>director of the Center for International</v>

155
00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:08.500
<v Speaker 3>Development of Harvard University.</v>

156
00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.333
<v Speaker 1>Generally speaking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>foreign professionals tend to be more </v>

157
00:08:11.051 --> 00:08:13.960
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurial,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which helps the economy too diverse.</v>

158
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:16.163
<v Speaker 3>In Chile,</v>
<v Speaker 3>the rate of entrepreneurship among </v>

159
00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:22.270
<v Speaker 3>immigrants is four times higher than </v>
<v Speaker 3>that among native Chileans.</v>

160
00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:25.930
<v Speaker 1>The second problem is that the so called</v>
<v Speaker 1>social data is not working.</v>

161
00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.793
<v Speaker 1>That is deceived.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There are new changes in the social </v>

162
00:08:27.851 --> 00:08:28.960
<v Speaker 1>classes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're born boy,</v>

163
00:08:28.961 --> 00:08:30.310
<v Speaker 1>you die poor.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you're born rich,</v>

164
00:08:30.311 --> 00:08:31.590
<v Speaker 1>you'd die rich.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>

165
00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:32.443
<v Speaker 1>the country is really controlled by </v>
<v Speaker 1>seven families whose wealth is </v>

166
00:08:34.361 --> 00:08:37.390
<v Speaker 1>equivalent to 17 percent of the national</v>
<v Speaker 1>GDP.</v>

167
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:38.283
<v Speaker 1>This might seem unimportant,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but when the social ladder in </v>

168
00:08:40.701 --> 00:08:41.534
<v Speaker 1>competition don't work,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it means the family name is more </v>

169
00:08:44.051 --> 00:08:48.280
<v Speaker 1>important than talent and effort.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The opportunity costs for the country is</v>

170
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:52.450
<v Speaker 1>huge and these families usually have </v>
<v Speaker 1>quite special relationships with power.</v>

171
00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.433
<v Speaker 1>Consider this</v>

172
00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.790
<v Speaker 4>bachelet son was charged with corruption</v>
<v Speaker 4>and Ronica look,</v>

173
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.910
<v Speaker 4>which one of the most powerful men in </v>
<v Speaker 4>Chile and the owner of the Bank of Chile</v>

174
00:09:04.940 --> 00:09:06.410
<v Speaker 4>was also involved in the scandal.</v>

175
00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.343
<v Speaker 1>Yup.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Even the back of that name has been </v>

176
00:09:08.401 --> 00:09:11.310
<v Speaker 1>spoiled with corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Then there's the bureaucracy.</v>

177
00:09:11.340 --> 00:09:13.890
<v Speaker 1>I'm sure you've heard that Chile is a </v>
<v Speaker 1>very free economy.</v>

178
00:09:13.891 --> 00:09:15.360
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you take a closer look,</v>

179
00:09:15.361 --> 00:09:20.070
<v Speaker 1>you can see it's also very bureaucratic.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It has all kinds of regulations.</v>

180
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:20.933
<v Speaker 1>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Chiney can't import secondhand cars and </v>

181
00:09:22.651 --> 00:09:25.740
<v Speaker 1>foreign workers don't have access to a </v>
<v Speaker 1>bank accounts so well.</v>

182
00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.560
<v Speaker 1>It certainly seems as if it could be </v>
<v Speaker 1>more free.</v>

183
00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.440
<v Speaker 1>Mark Twain said that all three kinds of </v>
<v Speaker 1>lies,</v>

184
00:09:31.470 --> 00:09:33.930
<v Speaker 1>lies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Damn lies and statistics.</v>

185
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.830
<v Speaker 1>The thing is initially,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well they probably have some of that</v>

186
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:42.100
<v Speaker 1>selections in the country will take </v>
<v Speaker 1>place on the 19th of November,</v>

187
00:09:42.101 --> 00:09:45.850
<v Speaker 1>2017,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and one thing is for sure if Jenny wants</v>

188
00:09:45.851 --> 00:09:49.290
<v Speaker 1>to go back to the good times,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they must change direction.</v>

189
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:49.751
<v Speaker 1>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

190
00:09:49.751 --> 00:09:51.370
<v Speaker 1>that's our opinion here,</v>
<v Speaker 1>official policy Polish.</v>

191
00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:53.260
<v Speaker 1>Now.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'd love to know what you think.</v>

192
00:09:53.261 --> 00:09:56.800
<v Speaker 1>What is your opinion of backlash?</v>
<v Speaker 1>What do you think of the Chilean model?</v>

193
