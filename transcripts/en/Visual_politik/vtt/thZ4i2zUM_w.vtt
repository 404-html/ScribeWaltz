<v Speaker 1>because this number may make more than </v>

5
00:00:08.671 --> 00:00:13.080
<v Speaker 1>one of you jumped out of your chair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to data from the World Tourism</v>

<v Speaker 1>that's more than 1.3 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>international tourists.</v>

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:26.843
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this gigantic industry generated more </v>

10
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.350
<v Speaker 1>than one point $2 trillion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I want to,</v>

<v Speaker 1>many of you have actually used us </v>

17
00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.070
<v Speaker 1>because of course we're talking about </v>

<v Speaker 1>implications does this have?</v>

21
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.180
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's dive in,</v>

22
00:01:12.181 --> 00:01:13.014

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Everything that has to do with Airbnb is</v>
<v Speaker 1>pretty impressive and no,</v>

25
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.280
<v Speaker 1>I'm really not exaggerating.</v>

26
00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.173
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

27

<v Speaker 1>companies in the ranking combined,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Marriott,</v>

<v Speaker 1>Airbnb alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more than 4 million.</v>

34
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:00.053
<v Speaker 1>We're actually talking about almost 5 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million rooms spread over more than 190 </v>

<v Speaker 1>different cities.</v>

37
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.113
<v Speaker 1>These data,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can imagine the huge panic that </v>

38
00:02:15.981 --> 00:02:16.814
<v Speaker 1>heavy and B has caused in the boards of </v>
<v Speaker 1>directors of the largest hotel </v>

39
00:02:19.691 --> 00:02:20.524
<v Speaker 1>companies.</v>

40
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.430
<v Speaker 2>Sure.</v>

41
00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.670
<v Speaker 1>BNB is a mortal threat to the US hotel </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry.</v>

42
00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:25.593
<v Speaker 1>Ian Schrager,</v>
<v Speaker 1>American entrepreneur hotelier and real </v>

43
00:02:28.121 --> 00:02:29.950
<v Speaker 1>estate developer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

44
00:02:29.951 --> 00:02:34.951
<v Speaker 1>the reality is while we have every </v>
<v Speaker 1>reason to panic since it was launched,</v>

45
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.080
<v Speaker 1>Airbnb as managed 300 million </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservations,</v>

46
00:02:42.081 --> 00:02:43.890
<v Speaker 1>but if that sounds like a lot,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

47
00:02:43.891 --> 00:02:44.724
<v Speaker 1>keep listening because the numbers are </v>
<v Speaker 1>growing so fast is that the company </v>

48
00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:51.770
<v Speaker 1>expects to surpass 1 billion </v>
<v Speaker 1>reservations as of 2028 a year.</v>

49
00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:58.183
<v Speaker 2>Wow.</v>

50
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:00.040
<v Speaker 1>Before we continue,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is</v>

51
00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:01.720
<v Speaker 2>one note here.</v>
<v Speaker 2>As you may know,</v>

52
00:03:01.721 --> 00:03:02.554
<v Speaker 2>most technology companies lose money,</v>
<v Speaker 2>sometimes a lot of money in the first </v>

53
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.140
<v Speaker 2>years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is because they have to spend a lot</v>

54
00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.450
<v Speaker 2>to start up the company,</v>
<v Speaker 2>acquire technology,</v>

55
00:03:10.451 --> 00:03:12.070
<v Speaker 2>build a brand,</v>
<v Speaker 2>get customers,</v>

56
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.933
<v Speaker 2>et cetera.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That's of course someone has to make </v>

57
00:03:14.561 --> 00:03:16.540
<v Speaker 2>that investment because while at the end</v>
<v Speaker 2>of the day,</v>

58
00:03:16.541 --> 00:03:20.470
<v Speaker 2>given minds that many times the founders</v>
<v Speaker 2>of these companies are students,</v>

59
00:03:20.471 --> 00:03:21.910
<v Speaker 2>engineers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>designers,</v>

60
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.540
<v Speaker 2>etc. Generally young people who are not </v>
<v Speaker 2>exactly billion as,</v>

61
00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.433
<v Speaker 2>that's why in silicon valley it's </v>
<v Speaker 2>practically throughout the entire </v>

62
00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:29.524
<v Speaker 2>technological worlds.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's an instrument that has become </v>

63
00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.060
<v Speaker 2>something like the holy grail of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>industry.</v>

64
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.350
<v Speaker 2>That's the financing round.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hello.</v>

65
00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:39.183
<v Speaker 1>Let me to explain how this works.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A startup when it's not listed on the </v>

66
00:03:41.681 --> 00:03:42.514
<v Speaker 1>stock market,</v>
<v Speaker 1>meets with a bunch of venture capital </v>

67
00:03:43.991 --> 00:03:44.824
<v Speaker 1>investors and presents their projects </v>
<v Speaker 1>and then the investor or investors who </v>

68
00:03:48.071 --> 00:03:48.904
<v Speaker 1>put money on the table or services such </v>
<v Speaker 1>as contacts and legal or technological </v>

69
00:03:52.541 --> 00:03:55.450
<v Speaker 1>support,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are given a part of the company and</v>

70
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.313
<v Speaker 1>when the startup needs more resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they have more financing rounds just </v>

71
00:04:00.071 --> 00:04:00.904
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

72
00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.393
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

73
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.493
<v Speaker 1>And its latest financing round.</v>
<v Speaker 1>AIRBNB got $1 billion for about 3% of </v>

74
00:04:11.721 --> 00:04:12.554
<v Speaker 1>its shares.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That means the investors valued the </v>

75
00:04:14.271 --> 00:04:15.104
<v Speaker 1>entire company at $31 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad for something that's 10 years </v>

76
00:04:18.621 --> 00:04:19.070
<v Speaker 1>old.</v>

77
00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.903
<v Speaker 2>Right.</v>

78
00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.853
<v Speaker 1>You said that you might now be wondering</v>
<v Speaker 1>how enough did a company founded by two </v>

79
00:04:28.071 --> 00:04:32.000
<v Speaker 1>young graduates managed to become such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>huge empire in such little time?</v>

80
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:32.923
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we're going to take a look at this and </v>

81
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.603
<v Speaker 1>where and how it all began.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And I'll tell you now that if the </v>

82
00:04:36.861 --> 00:04:40.400
<v Speaker 1>current numbers are impressive,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that origins are not far behind.</v>

83
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.383
<v Speaker 1>So listen up</v>

84
00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:49.803
<v Speaker 2>the roots.</v>

85
00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.670
<v Speaker 1>I imagine it's the year 2007 and your 26</v>
<v Speaker 1>years old,</v>

86
00:04:56.671 --> 00:05:00.570
<v Speaker 1>you've just finished your studies and </v>
<v Speaker 1>you've moved to seek your fortune in the</v>

87
00:05:00.571 --> 00:05:02.880
<v Speaker 1>Capitol of technological </v>
<v Speaker 1>entrepreneurship,</v>

88
00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:03.753
<v Speaker 1>San Francisco.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But of course you've got to pay a lot's </v>

89
00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:06.314
<v Speaker 1>to live in such a fashionable city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so you get an apartment for $1,200 a </v>

90
00:05:09.991 --> 00:05:12.210
<v Speaker 1>month,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which you can still barely a force.</v>

91
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.320
<v Speaker 1>The question is,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

92
00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.310
<v Speaker 1>what would you do now?</v>

93
00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.323
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>

94
00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:22.320
<v Speaker 1>well that's precisely the question that </v>
<v Speaker 1>Brian Chesky and Joe Gibeah to have.</v>

95
00:05:22.321 --> 00:05:26.860
<v Speaker 1>Airbnb is three parents to answer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When an opportunity presented itself,</v>

96
00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.560
<v Speaker 1>there was a conference in the city,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a designer's congress,</v>

97
00:05:29.561 --> 00:05:32.470
<v Speaker 1>and the hotels were full.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if these two guys had an idea,</v>

98
00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:33.363
<v Speaker 1>they said,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why don't we buy a couple of their </v>

99
00:05:34.201 --> 00:05:36.820
<v Speaker 1>mattresses but them in the living room </v>
<v Speaker 1>and rent them out?</v>

100
00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:38.110
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>ask precisely what they did.</v>

101
00:05:38.111 --> 00:05:41.740
<v Speaker 1>They offered a mattress to sleep on and </v>
<v Speaker 1>breakfast in the morning in exchange for</v>

102
00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:42.603
<v Speaker 1>some money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which they would use to pay their rent </v>

103
00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:44.883
<v Speaker 1>to find customers.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They set up a website app at and </v>

104
00:05:46.721 --> 00:05:50.380
<v Speaker 1>breakfast dotcom where customers could </v>
<v Speaker 1>book a mattress in their living room.</v>

105
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:54.010
<v Speaker 1>They got three customers and made $80 on</v>
<v Speaker 1>the first night of the conference.</v>

106
00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:55.653
<v Speaker 1>Funny.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But we didn't think air bed and </v>

107
00:05:56.681 --> 00:05:58.220
<v Speaker 1>breakfast would be a big idea.</v>

108
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.113
<v Speaker 3>You thought it might be able to pay the </v>
<v Speaker 3>rent until we could think of the big </v>

109
00:06:00.921 --> 00:06:01.754
<v Speaker 3>idea.</v>
<v Speaker 3>One thing I learned is big ideas sound </v>

110
00:06:03.711 --> 00:06:05.880
<v Speaker 3>stupid in the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Brian Chesky,</v>

111
00:06:05.881 --> 00:06:08.270
<v Speaker 3>the founder and CEO of Airbnb,</v>

112
00:06:08.390 --> 00:06:10.820
<v Speaker 1>well little by little they notice that </v>
<v Speaker 1>the idea,</v>

113
00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:11.683
<v Speaker 1>it wasn't say far fetched in February of</v>
<v Speaker 1>2008 Nathan Bashas can architect by </v>

114
00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:19.910
<v Speaker 1>profession and joins the project as the </v>
<v Speaker 1>third co founder and do with that Airbnb</v>

115
00:06:19.911 --> 00:06:20.860
<v Speaker 1>was well on its way.</v>

116
00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.110
<v Speaker 4>Oh cool.</v>

117
00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:27.543
<v Speaker 1>It was not going to be easy.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The concept was nearly an embryo and </v>

118
00:06:29.851 --> 00:06:32.760
<v Speaker 1>idea that many investors thought who is </v>
<v Speaker 1>completely crazy.</v>

119
00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:35.490
<v Speaker 1>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a service to rent out a bed,</v>

120
00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.850
<v Speaker 1>an air mattress or even a sofa in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>stranger's house.</v>

121
00:06:38.851 --> 00:06:41.250
<v Speaker 1>I mean it's a pretty bizarre idea.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So we were,</v>

122
00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:44.720
<v Speaker 1>all they had was their credit cards and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their own ingenuity.</v>

123
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:45.713
<v Speaker 5>Even said the other day that you would </v>
<v Speaker 5>not meet a potentially with the prime </v>

124
00:06:49.071 --> 00:06:49.904
<v Speaker 5>minister of Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm not going to shut the White House </v>

125
00:06:51.801 --> 00:06:54.530
<v Speaker 5>visitors scheduled before.</v>
<v Speaker 5>I'm pressure the United States.</v>

126
00:06:54.531 --> 00:06:58.310
<v Speaker 5>I don't even have a seal yet.</v>
<v Speaker 5>You hear one thing and speeches and then</v>

127
00:06:58.311 --> 00:07:02.090
<v Speaker 5>you see a campaign that has the worst </v>
<v Speaker 5>kind of tactics.</v>

128
00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:04.160
<v Speaker 5>Shame on you,</v>
<v Speaker 5>Barack Obama.</v>

129
00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:07.970
<v Speaker 5>You can actually see Russia from land </v>
<v Speaker 5>here in Alaska.</v>

130
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.770
<v Speaker 1>This first,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a bit of luck came in the summer of 2008</v>

131
00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:14.633
<v Speaker 1>it was the election year and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Democratic Party and Republican Party </v>

132
00:07:16.711 --> 00:07:19.020
<v Speaker 1>primaries coming to an end.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you know,</v>

133
00:07:19.021 --> 00:07:22.380
<v Speaker 1>they ended with a great convention where</v>
<v Speaker 1>each party appoints the candidates.</v>

134
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:23.303
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the nominees when Barack Obama and John </v>

135
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.123
<v Speaker 1>Mccain,</v>

136
00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:27.440
<v Speaker 2>wow,</v>

137
00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:28.273
<v Speaker 1>do you advertise and raise funds?</v>
<v Speaker 1>They released a breakfast cereal with </v>

138
00:07:31.071 --> 00:07:33.290
<v Speaker 1>the pictures of the candidates in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>

139
00:07:33.350 --> 00:07:36.710
<v Speaker 1>The best part is they caught the </v>
<v Speaker 1>attention of venture capital company.</v>

140
00:07:36.740 --> 00:07:39.080
<v Speaker 1>There's only a few months later,</v>
<v Speaker 1>gave them $20,000</v>

141
00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:43.720
<v Speaker 1>from that [inaudible].</v>
<v Speaker 1>That growth was unstoppable,</v>

142
00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:45.100
<v Speaker 1>and today,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a decade later,</v>

143
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.050
<v Speaker 1>these two guys who couldn't afford their</v>
<v Speaker 1>rents have more than $3 billion each and</v>

144
00:07:50.051 --> 00:07:52.900
<v Speaker 1>a pen and the ranking of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>richest people.</v>

145
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.793
<v Speaker 1>Indeed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a pretty amazing example of the </v>

146
00:07:55.271 --> 00:07:56.104
<v Speaker 1>American dream coming true.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that throughout this </v>

147
00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:00.430
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>
<v Speaker 1>technology played a big role,</v>

148
00:08:00.460 --> 00:08:03.400
<v Speaker 1>but so did the philosophy of the project</v>
<v Speaker 1>itself.</v>

149
00:08:03.430 --> 00:08:05.080
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as I'm sure you all know,</v>

150
00:08:05.081 --> 00:08:06.970
<v Speaker 1>airbnb,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it doesn't own apartments.</v>

151
00:08:06.971 --> 00:08:07.804
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't own hotels.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's simply an intermediary in a very </v>

152
00:08:10.361 --> 00:08:11.194
<v Speaker 1>synthetic way.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The idea of the company is something </v>

153
00:08:13.780 --> 00:08:14.613
<v Speaker 1>like this.</v>

154
00:08:15.220 --> 00:08:15.750
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

155
00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:16.583
<v Speaker 1>In the wells that are many unused </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources such as empty rooms and empty </v>

156
00:08:20.101 --> 00:08:20.934
<v Speaker 1>apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So if instead of investing in new </v>

157
00:08:22.651 --> 00:08:23.484
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>
<v Speaker 1>we give the owners of those unused </v>

158
00:08:25.081 --> 00:08:27.960
<v Speaker 1>resources the opportunity to make or </v>
<v Speaker 1>improve their income,</v>

159
00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:30.100
<v Speaker 1>we can invest the money that we have in </v>
<v Speaker 1>tech</v>

160
00:08:30.350 --> 00:08:31.183
<v Speaker 2>Jay,</v>

161
00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:34.443
<v Speaker 1>and now airbnb is going a step further.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It wants to do the same with people's </v>

162
00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:38.923
<v Speaker 1>ingenuity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They've decided to launch an experience </v>

163
00:08:41.201 --> 00:08:42.034
<v Speaker 1>service.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Allow me to explain how about some </v>

164
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:45.190
<v Speaker 1>performance and activity.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You like bike riding,</v>

165
00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.110
<v Speaker 1>visiting monuments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wine tasting,</v>

166
00:08:47.111 --> 00:08:50.680
<v Speaker 1>whatever has airbnb offers this </v>
<v Speaker 1>experience to its customers.</v>

167
00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.070
<v Speaker 1>What are their best known experiences is</v>
<v Speaker 1>the one you're seeing here?</v>

168
00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:57.600
<v Speaker 1>It's an adventure in which you can get </v>
<v Speaker 1>to know the world of wolves.</v>

169
00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:01.470
<v Speaker 1>It's creator has already raised more </v>
<v Speaker 1>than $300,000.</v>

170
00:09:11.880 --> 00:09:12.460
<v Speaker 2>The truth</v>

171
00:09:12.460 --> 00:09:16.100
<v Speaker 1>is that if you think about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>connecting and exploiting under utilized</v>

172
00:09:16.101 --> 00:09:20.270
<v Speaker 1>assets and people services and </v>
<v Speaker 1>creativity isn't only a great idea.</v>

173
00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.133
<v Speaker 1>It also implies taking advantage of </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources in a very efficient way while </v>

174
00:09:24.890 --> 00:09:27.770
<v Speaker 1>generating lots of benefits for society </v>
<v Speaker 1>that,</v>

175
00:09:27.771 --> 00:09:29.810
<v Speaker 1>hold on a second because you're probably</v>
<v Speaker 1>thinking right now,</v>

176
00:09:29.811 --> 00:09:32.360
<v Speaker 1>benefits society,</v>
<v Speaker 1>airbnb rarely Simon,</v>

177
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:33.380
<v Speaker 1>I mean the shore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>our road.</v>

178
00:09:33.381 --> 00:09:34.214
<v Speaker 1>Lots of politicians out there who are </v>
<v Speaker 1>saying that we need to pass the cute or </v>

179
00:09:35.961 --> 00:09:39.230
<v Speaker 1>at least limit these types of companies,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is yes,</v>

180
00:09:39.231 --> 00:09:41.060
<v Speaker 1>there are benefits and I'm going to tell</v>
<v Speaker 1>you about them.</v>

181
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.453
<v Speaker 2>The benefits,</v>

182
00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:55.530
<v Speaker 1>why the bad publicity that has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>having lately and D has brought a lot of</v>

183
00:09:55.531 --> 00:09:57.690
<v Speaker 1>benefits to society as a whole.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The one,</v>

184
00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.240
<v Speaker 1>it's making travel more affordable for </v>
<v Speaker 1>everyone.</v>

185
00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:01.973
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the u s the average rooms offered by </v>

186
00:10:03.991 --> 00:10:04.824
<v Speaker 1>this platform are between 35% and 47% </v>
<v Speaker 1>cheaper than the average rooms offered </v>

187
00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:14.300
<v Speaker 1>by hotels in the same city.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have a much wider offer.</v>

188
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:18.700
<v Speaker 1>You can find almost anything that suits </v>
<v Speaker 1>your preferences on Airbnb,</v>

189
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:19.673
<v Speaker 1>even if,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I don't know if you wanted perhaps a </v>

190
00:10:21.121 --> 00:10:21.954
<v Speaker 1>tree house.</v>

191
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:24.060
<v Speaker 2>Okay,</v>

192
00:10:24.060 --> 00:10:26.170
<v Speaker 1>sneak.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a pretty inexhaustible source of</v>

193
00:10:26.171 --> 00:10:27.220
<v Speaker 1>wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more tourism,</v>

194
00:10:27.221 --> 00:10:28.900
<v Speaker 1>more services,</v>
<v Speaker 1>more jobs.</v>

195
00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:29.763
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this platform is user spends on average </v>

196
00:10:31.570 --> 00:10:33.700
<v Speaker 1>twice as much as other tourists.</v>

197
00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:35.800
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

198
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:36.633
<v Speaker 1>Perhaps and Andy's greatest overall </v>
<v Speaker 1>benefit has been that it's allowed </v>

199
00:10:39.371 --> 00:10:40.204
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of thousands of people,</v>
<v Speaker 1>usually middle class people to become </v>

200
00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.340
<v Speaker 1>real entrepreneurs in the tourism </v>
<v Speaker 1>sector,</v>

201
00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:49.693
<v Speaker 1>thanks to Airbnb.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many families that had free rooms or an </v>

202
00:10:51.801 --> 00:10:52.634
<v Speaker 1>apartment or bought an old one to </v>
<v Speaker 1>restore it and exploited now have a new </v>

203
00:10:55.971 --> 00:10:58.520
<v Speaker 1>source of income since it was launched </v>
<v Speaker 1>to the posts.</v>

204
00:10:58.521 --> 00:10:59.354
<v Speaker 1>The owners who runs their rooms and </v>
<v Speaker 1>their houses cover received more than </v>

205
00:11:01.671 --> 00:11:03.990
<v Speaker 1>$41 billion.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And the data,</v>

206
00:11:04.010 --> 00:11:04.843
<v Speaker 1>it's very clear about this.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Most of the beneficiaries and middle </v>

207
00:11:06.871 --> 00:11:11.871
<v Speaker 1>class families and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>don't worry.</v>

208
00:11:18.571 --> 00:11:21.000
<v Speaker 1>I know that not everything is quite so </v>
<v Speaker 1>rosy.</v>

209
00:11:21.030 --> 00:11:23.910
<v Speaker 1>AIRBNB has also generated some problems.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>

210
00:11:23.911 --> 00:11:24.744
<v Speaker 1>in the busiest cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>average rent has increased and some </v>

211
00:11:26.941 --> 00:11:30.480
<v Speaker 1>neighborhoods have become very busy to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the displeasure of the kneaders.</v>

212
00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:35.993
<v Speaker 2>Okay.</v>

213
00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:38.490
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>aren't city's supposed to be dynamic?</v>

214
00:11:38.520 --> 00:11:42.390
<v Speaker 1>Is it bad for city to come alive and </v>
<v Speaker 1>create jobs and create wealth?</v>

215
00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.253
<v Speaker 1>Isn't the real problem in how expensive </v>
<v Speaker 1>houses often driven by politics as we </v>

216
00:11:46.741 --> 00:11:48.210
<v Speaker 1>saw in this video?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

217
00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.073
<v Speaker 1>we're going to talk about that in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>future video as well because this is </v>

218
00:11:51.171 --> 00:11:54.100
<v Speaker 1>certainly a lot to say about it,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but for now it's your turn.</v>

219
00:11:54.101 --> 00:11:56.110
<v Speaker 1>What do you think should be done with </v>
