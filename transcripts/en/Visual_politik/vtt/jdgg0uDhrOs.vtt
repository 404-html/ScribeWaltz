<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.980
<v Speaker 2>Israel does not have the world's biggest</v>
<v Speaker 2>army bus.</v>

3
00:00:09.981 --> 00:00:11.740
<v Speaker 2>It is the most effective.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Think about it,</v>

4
00:00:11.741 --> 00:00:15.280
<v Speaker 2>we are talking about the country with </v>
<v Speaker 2>less than 9 million inhabitants.</v>

5
00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:16.293
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have won wars against countries 10 </v>

6
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.110
<v Speaker 2>times bigger.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>

7
00:00:20.111 --> 00:00:20.944
<v Speaker 2>during the six days war,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel confronted a coalition that </v>

8
00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:24.970
<v Speaker 2>included Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Syria and Jordan.</v>

9
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.153
<v Speaker 2>These countries put together sums up to </v>
<v Speaker 2>more than 130 million people and they </v>

10
00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:37.791
<v Speaker 2>sent over 240,000 soldiers twice as many</v>
<v Speaker 2>as the Israeli army debt.</v>

11
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.263
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>
<v Speaker 2>no one would expect a victory for </v>

12
00:00:40.681 --> 00:00:41.514
<v Speaker 2>Israel.</v>
<v Speaker 2>That history was rather difference in </v>

13
00:00:45.731 --> 00:00:50.110
<v Speaker 2>just six days of the Israeli defense </v>
<v Speaker 2>forces also known as IDF wiped out their</v>

14
00:00:50.111 --> 00:00:52.960
<v Speaker 2>enemies and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>I know where you're going to say now the</v>

15
00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.360
<v Speaker 2>Israelis have the best technology and </v>
<v Speaker 2>weaponry,</v>

16
00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.253
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

17
00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.360
<v Speaker 2>that is true now,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it wasn't back then.</v>

18
00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.180
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in 1973 during the Yom Kippur war,</v>

19
00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.360
<v Speaker 2>Israel's weapons where as modern as </v>
<v Speaker 2>those of their main rivals,</v>

20
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:07.280
<v Speaker 2>Syria.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

21
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.163
<v Speaker 2>the IDF had some combat jets </v>
<v Speaker 2>manufactured in the 1950s the famous a </v>

22
00:01:12.011 --> 00:01:13.510
<v Speaker 2>four Skyhawk.</v>
<v Speaker 2>However,</v>

23
00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:14.344
<v Speaker 2>the Syrians,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they had state of the art anti aircraft </v>

24
00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.550
<v Speaker 2>to isles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They were given to the Soviets just five</v>

25
00:01:18.551 --> 00:01:20.710
<v Speaker 2>years before.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And you won that wall.</v>

26
00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.880
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it was Israel.</v>

27
00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:22.511
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

28
00:01:22.511 --> 00:01:23.860
<v Speaker 2>so I can hear something you're saying </v>
<v Speaker 2>no.</v>

29
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:24.431
<v Speaker 2>Oh,</v>
<v Speaker 2>come on.</v>

30
00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.590
<v Speaker 2>Sign.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But Israel has the sport of America.</v>

31
00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.240
<v Speaker 2>That's a really big help.</v>

32
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.930
<v Speaker 2>And yes,</v>
<v Speaker 2>at this point you are right.</v>

33
00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.080
<v Speaker 2>Israel is the country that receives the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most help from Uncle Sam.</v>

34
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.370
<v Speaker 2>But do you know of any other country who</v>
<v Speaker 2>buys the best weaponry from America?</v>

35
00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.020
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that would be Saudi Arabia.</v>

36
00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.800
<v Speaker 2>The Saudi's have an army as big and as </v>
<v Speaker 2>modern as the Israeli one.</v>

37
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.860
<v Speaker 2>But if you've been subscribed to visual </v>
<v Speaker 2>politic for a while and you already know</v>

38
00:01:49.861 --> 00:01:53.280
<v Speaker 2>that the big failure of the Saudi army </v>
<v Speaker 2>was fighting guerrilla warriors,</v>

39
00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:56.730
<v Speaker 2>namely those who see rebels from Yemen.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

40
00:01:56.731 --> 00:02:00.450
<v Speaker 2>neither the technology nor the </v>
<v Speaker 2>American's support are enough to explain</v>

41
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.150
<v Speaker 2>why the Israeli army is such a fearful.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

42
00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.030
<v Speaker 2>So the question of the day is why is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israeli army so powerful?</v>

43
00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.720
<v Speaker 2>What are the key elements explaining </v>
<v Speaker 2>such military success?</v>

44
00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:14.703
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>today we are going to tell you the five </v>

45
00:02:16.121 --> 00:02:21.121
<v Speaker 2>key facts that explain this fast </v>
<v Speaker 2>decision making.</v>

46
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:26.060
<v Speaker 2>Every almay is based on hierarchy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>authority,</v>

47
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.170
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

48
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.690
<v Speaker 2>some of them,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they're more flexible than others.</v>

49
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:30.583
<v Speaker 2>In this other video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>we explained how the Saudi army and has </v>

50
00:02:32.871 --> 00:02:33.704
<v Speaker 2>a bigger sense of hierarchy and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>officials don't have much power to make </v>

51
00:02:36.771 --> 00:02:37.604
<v Speaker 2>their own decisions.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same goes with other Arabic </v>

52
00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.980
<v Speaker 2>countries like Syria or Egypt.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>

53
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.833
<v Speaker 2>here is an example.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Imagine a Syrian unit defending a </v>

54
00:02:44.781 --> 00:02:45.614
<v Speaker 2>position.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's say the headquarters have been </v>

55
00:02:46.941 --> 00:02:49.490
<v Speaker 2>destroyed before the soldiers in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>front line are aware of it.</v>

56
00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.333
<v Speaker 1>That's</v>

57
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.210
<v Speaker 2>if they have to follow the normal </v>
<v Speaker 2>procedure.</v>

58
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.600
<v Speaker 2>They will have to wait until someone </v>
<v Speaker 2>gives them an order during this time,</v>

59
00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.290
<v Speaker 2>they don't know if they should retreat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>strike back,</v>

60
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.110
<v Speaker 2>or coordinate with other military units.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

61
00:03:02.111 --> 00:03:03.370
<v Speaker 2>so now you might be wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>

62
00:03:03.371 --> 00:03:05.740
<v Speaker 2>why are Arab armies so centralized?</v>
<v Speaker 2>No,</v>

63
00:03:05.741 --> 00:03:06.574
<v Speaker 2>don't forget the,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most of these countries aren't </v>

64
00:03:07.451 --> 00:03:08.284
<v Speaker 2>dictatorships or absolute monarchies.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you are a higher and you want your </v>

65
00:03:11.561 --> 00:03:12.394
<v Speaker 2>army to be under control in order to </v>
<v Speaker 2>micromanage every little decision in </v>

66
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.740
<v Speaker 2>order to prevent acute attack,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he is rainy.</v>

67
00:03:19.741 --> 00:03:23.940
<v Speaker 2>Ami is way different from that.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's look back to our previous example.</v>

68
00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:24.833
<v Speaker 2>In this case,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the is rainy commander on the front </v>

69
00:03:26.281 --> 00:03:28.260
<v Speaker 2>line.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Would it need to wait for orders?</v>

70
00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.760
<v Speaker 2>He has a degree of his own decision </v>
<v Speaker 2>making power so he can react immediately</v>

71
00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.770
<v Speaker 2>and seize opportunities.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

72
00:03:34.771 --> 00:03:37.650
<v Speaker 2>this is pretty normal in almost all </v>
<v Speaker 2>western armies.</v>

73
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.340
<v Speaker 2>The big planning is centralized,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the execution is decentralized.</v>

74
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.310
<v Speaker 2>This way the organization is more </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexible and can react more right</v>

75
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:45.243
<v Speaker 1>quickly.</v>

76
00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:49.543
<v Speaker 2>Unlike the western countries,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israel has something unique in that </v>

77
00:03:51.921 --> 00:03:52.754
<v Speaker 2>culture.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We all talking about a pretty unknown </v>

78
00:03:54.351 --> 00:03:55.690
<v Speaker 2>fact about this country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

79
00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.490
<v Speaker 2>it is a very,</v>
<v Speaker 2>very important one.</v>

80
00:03:58.520 --> 00:03:59.353
<v Speaker 2>Israel is the least hierarchical country</v>
<v Speaker 2>on the planet and you can feel this in </v>

81
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.560
<v Speaker 2>every aspect of their culture inside of </v>
<v Speaker 2>an Israeli company.</v>

82
00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:07.394
<v Speaker 2>It's pretty normal for an average worker</v>
<v Speaker 2>to have a discussion with his boss </v>

83
00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.180
<v Speaker 2>debate site a common thing and there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a pretty small sense of authority.</v>

84
00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.343
<v Speaker 2>Actually in the 1970s of Dutch </v>
<v Speaker 2>anthropologist named Geert Hofstetter </v>

85
00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.710
<v Speaker 2>studied the power relationships in </v>
<v Speaker 2>different countries.</v>

86
00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.603
<v Speaker 2>Over the course of six years,</v>
<v Speaker 2>he surveyed ibm workers in different </v>

87
00:04:27.311 --> 00:04:31.810
<v Speaker 2>offices around the globe.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is how the power distance index was</v>

88
00:04:31.811 --> 00:04:33.760
<v Speaker 2>born,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and among all those countries,</v>

89
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.623
<v Speaker 2>Israel has the lowest power distance.</v>
<v Speaker 2>While the Arab countries like Egypt or </v>

90
00:04:38.291 --> 00:04:41.680
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia rank among the highest.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

91
00:04:41.681 --> 00:04:45.650
<v Speaker 2>Israeli citizens are educated in </v>
<v Speaker 2>flexibility more than any other nation.</v>

92
00:04:45.651 --> 00:04:46.484
<v Speaker 2>Yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>internal cohesion in Israel military </v>

93
00:04:49.701 --> 00:04:50.534
<v Speaker 2>service is mandatory for every citizen </v>
<v Speaker 2>regardless of their social condition or </v>

94
00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:55.790
<v Speaker 2>that gender.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both men and women,</v>

95
00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:57.810
<v Speaker 2>rich and poor start from the very</v>

96
00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:58.733
<v Speaker 1>awesome.</v>

97
00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:04.463
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually this is not entirely true </v>

98
00:05:05.521 --> 00:05:06.354
<v Speaker 2>because the ultra orthodox Jews don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>need to do military service and neither </v>

99
00:05:09.091 --> 00:05:09.924
<v Speaker 2>does Israel's Palestinian population,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but the rest of Israel citizens must </v>

100
00:05:13.261 --> 00:05:16.590
<v Speaker 2>serve in the military and fall into a </v>
<v Speaker 2>meritocratic scheme.</v>

101
00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.970
<v Speaker 2>This means everyone must follow the same</v>
<v Speaker 2>rules in order to be promoted,</v>

102
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:24.120
<v Speaker 2>and this is not as common as you might </v>
<v Speaker 2>think.</v>

103
00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:25.650
<v Speaker 2>For instance,</v>
<v Speaker 2>during World War II,</v>

104
00:05:25.651 --> 00:05:26.484
<v Speaker 2>the aristocrats grants who joined the </v>
<v Speaker 2>British army started with higher </v>

105
00:05:28.441 --> 00:05:31.200
<v Speaker 2>positions and the peasants and the </v>
<v Speaker 2>working class.</v>

106
00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:37.890
<v Speaker 2>As of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's such elitism,</v>

107
00:05:37.891 --> 00:05:41.490
<v Speaker 2>it tends to destroy an army's morale and</v>
<v Speaker 2>make it harder for it to function.</v>

108
00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:42.383
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Saudi army consists of both civil </v>

109
00:05:44.161 --> 00:05:46.500
<v Speaker 2>sevenths ams,</v>
<v Speaker 2>members of the royal family.</v>

110
00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:54.603
<v Speaker 2>As hierarchy matters a lot.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The son of the Saudi prince will be a </v>

111
00:05:57.531 --> 00:05:59.240
<v Speaker 2>soldier,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and as you can imagine,</v>

112
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.360
<v Speaker 2>this classist structure has negative </v>
<v Speaker 2>consequences.</v>

113
00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:07.990
<v Speaker 1>Combat</v>

114
00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:09.220
<v Speaker 2>morale.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In the,</v>

115
00:06:09.221 --> 00:06:13.630
<v Speaker 2>in 1973 Israel forced the Egyptian and </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Syrian army at the same time.</v>

116
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:15.790
<v Speaker 2>As we said at the beginning,</v>
<v Speaker 2>back then,</v>

117
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.240
<v Speaker 2>Israel was not the technological </v>
<v Speaker 2>powerhouse that it is today.</v>

118
00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.133
<v Speaker 2>Syrians had those antiaircraft guns,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Sdu hundreds that we mentioned </v>

119
00:06:22.661 --> 00:06:24.520
<v Speaker 2>before,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and during the first days,</v>

120
00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:28.870
<v Speaker 2>those anti aircraft missiles destroyed a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of Israeli combat jets,</v>

121
00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:33.670
<v Speaker 2>Israel answer retreat.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

122
00:06:33.671 --> 00:06:34.504
<v Speaker 2>Uncle Sam was here to help.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The White House sends a package of </v>

123
00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:39.520
<v Speaker 2>weapons so they could neutralize the Sdu</v>
<v Speaker 2>hundreds and the radars,</v>

124
00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:40.533
<v Speaker 2>things like flags that could confuse the</v>
<v Speaker 2>smart missiles that would guide it by </v>

125
00:06:43.121 --> 00:06:43.954
<v Speaker 2>temperature this way.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Israeli struck back and in a short </v>

126
00:06:48.361 --> 00:06:51.480
<v Speaker 2>amount of time they finished off the </v>
<v Speaker 2>Syrian defenses as well.</v>

127
00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:53.040
<v Speaker 2>Guess what happened next?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

128
00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:56.460
<v Speaker 2>the loss of those Arab soldiers scared </v>
<v Speaker 2>of being wiped out from the air.</v>

129
00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they defected.</v>

130
00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:03.870
<v Speaker 2>If you look at the picture on the </v>
<v Speaker 2>screen,</v>

131
00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.260
<v Speaker 2>you will see seven Syrian tanks.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They are not moving,</v>

132
00:07:07.290 --> 00:07:12.290
<v Speaker 2>but not one of them is destroyed.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

133
00:07:12.751 --> 00:07:15.300
<v Speaker 2>it means that the soldiers that were </v>
<v Speaker 2>inside of those tanks,</v>

134
00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.193
<v Speaker 2>they decided to run away.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Defection is a common problem when </v>

135
00:07:19.141 --> 00:07:19.974
<v Speaker 2>morale is low,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and this is a common problem for Arab </v>

136
00:07:22.351 --> 00:07:22.730
<v Speaker 2>army</v>

137
00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:23.563
<v Speaker 1>s</v>

138
00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:28.210
<v Speaker 2>Syrian troops defect to southern Turkish</v>
<v Speaker 2>province of Hottie.</v>

139
00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:29.163
<v Speaker 2>Think about it.</v>
<v Speaker 2>If you aren't an Israeli soldier or an </v>

140
00:07:30.911 --> 00:07:31.744
<v Speaker 2>American one,</v>
<v Speaker 2>you know you must be loyal to your </v>

141
00:07:33.731 --> 00:07:36.850
<v Speaker 2>country,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but Arab soldiers have too many ethnic,</v>

142
00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.580
<v Speaker 2>national,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and religious identity.</v>

143
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:42.733
<v Speaker 2>Imagine you are a Syrian soldiers and at</v>
<v Speaker 2>the same time you are occurs or you </v>

144
00:07:45.891 --> 00:07:46.724
<v Speaker 2>belong to the Muslim Brotherhood.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Both groups aren't chased by the Syrian </v>

145
00:07:49.371 --> 00:07:51.590
<v Speaker 2>government so well.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Who were your loyalty?</v>

146
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.753
<v Speaker 2>Of course the army pays your bills,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but when your life is a risk and </v>

147
00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:57.080
<v Speaker 2>everything is lost,</v>
<v Speaker 2>when what's more important?</v>

148
00:07:57.470 --> 00:07:58.303
<v Speaker 2>Your salary,</v>

149
00:07:58.530 --> 00:07:59.363
<v Speaker 1>life,</v>

150
00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.760
<v Speaker 2>no matter your wealth and your </v>
<v Speaker 2>technology.</v>

151
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:07.160
<v Speaker 2>If your soldiers are not strongly </v>
<v Speaker 2>motivated,</v>

152
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.380
<v Speaker 2>you've already lost ans the Israelis,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know that better than anyone.</v>

153
00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:19.380
<v Speaker 2>Capitol old tanks place their engines on</v>
<v Speaker 2>the backside,</v>

154
00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.410
<v Speaker 2>but why is this?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Because usually the rocket center on the</v>

155
00:08:22.411 --> 00:08:23.244
<v Speaker 2>front side,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Angie wants your tank to keep working </v>

156
00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:25.913
<v Speaker 2>even after being hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why all the models from the </v>

157
00:08:28.231 --> 00:08:32.640
<v Speaker 2>German leopards do the Russian tea </v>
<v Speaker 2>nineties keep that engine's in the back.</v>

158
00:08:32.730 --> 00:08:33.563
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Israeli army doesn't value the </v>

159
00:08:34.981 --> 00:08:35.814
<v Speaker 2>vehicle as much as their soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why the Israeli mccarver is the </v>

160
00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:42.360
<v Speaker 2>only one of its kinds of,</v>
<v Speaker 2>that has the engine's in the front.</v>

161
00:08:45.950 --> 00:08:46.130
<v Speaker 1>This</v>

162
00:08:46.130 --> 00:08:47.540
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a rocket will destroy the tank,</v>

163
00:08:47.541 --> 00:08:50.120
<v Speaker 2>but it will protect the soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Putting aside the ethics,</v>

164
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:51.073
<v Speaker 2>Israel has a really small population.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This means that they can't allow </v>

165
00:08:53.481 --> 00:08:54.314
<v Speaker 2>themselves to lose too many soldiers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why they receive much more </v>

166
00:08:57.421 --> 00:09:00.630
<v Speaker 2>intense training with real bullets and </v>
<v Speaker 2>better equipment.</v>

167
00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:03.630
<v Speaker 2>And don't forget that this is the </v>
<v Speaker 2>country where craft mudguard one,</v>

168
00:09:03.631 --> 00:09:05.790
<v Speaker 2>it's the most advanced martial arts was </v>
<v Speaker 2>born.</v>

169
00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:09.630
<v Speaker 2>You can also see this human capital </v>
<v Speaker 2>doctrine reflected in their intelligence</v>

170
00:09:09.631 --> 00:09:10.740
<v Speaker 2>service.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The massage,</v>

171
00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:13.710
<v Speaker 2>it is considered one of the best in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>entire world.</v>

172
00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:14.693
<v Speaker 1>Wow.</v>

173
00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:18.123
<v Speaker 2>One day you happen to travel to Israel </v>
<v Speaker 2>and you should know that they will take </v>

174
00:09:20.621 --> 00:09:24.490
<v Speaker 2>your phone number and other data because</v>
<v Speaker 2>they know information is power.</v>

175
00:09:26.610 --> 00:09:26.900
<v Speaker 1>Yep.</v>

176
00:09:26.900 --> 00:09:27.561
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right.</v>

177
00:09:27.561 --> 00:09:28.520
<v Speaker 2>I know what you want to hit.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now,</v>

178
00:09:28.580 --> 00:09:29.413
<v Speaker 2>you came to this video because you </v>
<v Speaker 2>wanted to hear about state of the art </v>

179
00:09:31.701 --> 00:09:32.720
<v Speaker 2>weaponry,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Rice.</v>

180
00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:34.010
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Hey,</v>

181
00:09:34.011 --> 00:09:34.844
<v Speaker 2>you have this made in Israel during the </v>
<v Speaker 2>1980 it's the Israeli government wanted </v>

182
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:45.943
<v Speaker 2>a secret weapon,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a weapon no one had ever heard of until </v>

183
00:09:48.801 --> 00:09:49.634
<v Speaker 2>recently.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So they met our local manufacturer or </v>

184
00:09:51.801 --> 00:09:55.610
<v Speaker 2>company called Rafael.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Do you design a very special vehicle?</v>

185
00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.810
<v Speaker 2>The so called para.</v>

186
00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.100
<v Speaker 2>This is a vehicle that looks like a </v>
<v Speaker 2>tank,</v>

187
00:10:02.101 --> 00:10:02.934
<v Speaker 2>but in fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as a tank hunter weapon with a big </v>

188
00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:06.840
<v Speaker 2>rocket launch chat,</v>
<v Speaker 2>if you know about weapons,</v>

189
00:10:06.841 --> 00:10:09.730
<v Speaker 2>you know there's a big difference.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Tank weaponry has to reach a distance of</v>

190
00:10:09.731 --> 00:10:10.564
<v Speaker 2>between two and four kilometers.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Perrier rockets can travel and distance </v>

191
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:14.333
<v Speaker 2>of 30 so imagine the situation.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The enemies would take satellite </v>

192
00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.384
<v Speaker 2>pictures to see the Israeli weaponry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>And as they would see a lot of normal </v>

193
00:10:20.941 --> 00:10:23.640
<v Speaker 2>tax based on this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they would turn their strategy,</v>

194
00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:24.563
<v Speaker 2>but then surprise,</v>
<v Speaker 2>surprise those tanks on not tanks and </v>

195
00:10:26.841 --> 00:10:27.601
<v Speaker 2>bars.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

196
00:10:27.601 --> 00:10:29.820
<v Speaker 2>something with a much,</v>
<v Speaker 2>much bigger,</v>

197
00:10:29.821 --> 00:10:30.070
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

198
00:10:30.070 --> 00:10:30.903
<v Speaker 1>Sure.</v>

199
00:10:34.420 --> 00:10:35.253
<v Speaker 2>The decades this para was one of the </v>
<v Speaker 2>most mysterious weapons if the Israeli </v>

200
00:10:38.341 --> 00:10:42.120
<v Speaker 2>army and their main strength was that no</v>
<v Speaker 2>one knew anything about them.</v>

201
00:10:42.210 --> 00:10:43.043
<v Speaker 2>So now the question is how come Israel </v>
<v Speaker 2>makes it's own secret weapons and other </v>

202
00:10:46.321 --> 00:10:47.460
<v Speaker 2>countries don't?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

203
00:10:47.461 --> 00:10:48.294
<v Speaker 2>the answer is that in Israel there are a</v>
<v Speaker 2>lot of rocket science companies that </v>

204
00:10:50.731 --> 00:10:51.564
<v Speaker 2>give it a worldclass defense industry.</v>
<v Speaker 2>So a while ago we did a video about </v>

205
00:10:54.750 --> 00:10:56.280
<v Speaker 2>Israeli startups.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well.</v>

206
00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:57.143
<v Speaker 2>In the 1980s the Israeli government </v>
<v Speaker 2>created a special program which was </v>

207
00:10:59.881 --> 00:11:03.330
<v Speaker 2>called a yells map.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This program consisted of 10 hedge funds</v>

208
00:11:03.331 --> 00:11:05.730
<v Speaker 2>with both private and government money </v>
<v Speaker 2>in them.</v>

209
00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.893
<v Speaker 2>Those funds helps to create a lot of </v>
<v Speaker 2>tech companies and you know what the </v>

210
00:11:09.691 --> 00:11:11.970
<v Speaker 2>favorite industry for those brand new </v>
<v Speaker 2>startups was?</v>

211
00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.730
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>of course it was the military industry.</v>

212
00:11:14.970 --> 00:11:16.470
<v Speaker 2>At the end of the day,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the army,</v>

213
00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:19.140
<v Speaker 2>it was a rich and reliable clients.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All of a sudden,</v>

214
00:11:19.290 --> 00:11:20.123
<v Speaker 2>dozens of weapons manufacturers were </v>
<v Speaker 2>born companies that created customized </v>

215
00:11:22.710 --> 00:11:26.540
<v Speaker 2>products that met the exact needs of the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Israeli army at every</v>

216
00:11:26.640 --> 00:11:27.473
<v Speaker 1>moment.</v>

217
00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.370
<v Speaker 2>Iron don't defense system to the Merkaba</v>
<v Speaker 2>tanks or the parade we mentioned before.</v>

218
00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:37.010
<v Speaker 2>Now you might be wondering what happens </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the other countries.</v>

219
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>let's first consider Saudi Arabia.</v>

220
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:40.370
<v Speaker 2>As you note,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the sound of your economy.</v>

221
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.430
<v Speaker 2>It's got a problem.</v>
<v Speaker 2>It relies heavily on the oil industry.</v>

222
00:11:43.550 --> 00:11:45.080
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 2>thanks to the dinosaur juice.</v>

223
00:11:45.081 --> 00:11:45.914
<v Speaker 2>The Saudis have become a rich and they </v>
<v Speaker 2>can pay for the third biggest army in </v>

224
00:11:49.191 --> 00:11:52.130
<v Speaker 2>the world,</v>
<v Speaker 2>only surpassed by China and America.</v>

225
00:11:56.040 --> 00:12:00.500
<v Speaker 2>Expensive is not a synonym for good.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The Saudi army buys their tanks from the</v>

226
00:12:00.501 --> 00:12:01.334
<v Speaker 2>USA ends.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Those are customized for the needs of </v>

227
00:12:03.021 --> 00:12:05.750
<v Speaker 2>the American army.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Like does that makes it harder to have a</v>

228
00:12:05.751 --> 00:12:06.584
<v Speaker 2>secret weapon because everyone knows </v>
<v Speaker 2>what you bought on the international </v>

229
00:12:08.991 --> 00:12:13.620
<v Speaker 2>market.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All right,</v>

230
00:12:13.621 --> 00:12:14.820
<v Speaker 2>so I probably know what you're thinking.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now.</v>

231
00:12:14.821 --> 00:12:17.340
<v Speaker 2>It seems that we're really talking up </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Israelis rice,</v>

232
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.353
<v Speaker 2>but do you make no mistake,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the Israeli army certainly has its weak </v>

233
00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:21.510
<v Speaker 2>points.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

234
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:24.270
<v Speaker 2>there is an organization that could make</v>
<v Speaker 2>their life even harder,</v>

235
