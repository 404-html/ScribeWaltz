00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.060
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible]</v>

2
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.323
<v Speaker 2>Kuwait's is alone with guitar,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the only country in the Arabian </v>

3
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.850
<v Speaker 2>peninsula where elections are hells.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yep.</v>

4
00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:14.773
<v Speaker 2>You heard that right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Many of you might know this country </v>

5
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:17.654
<v Speaker 2>because of the oil reserves that wealth,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all the facts that they were invaded by </v>

6
00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:25.580
<v Speaker 2>Saddam Hussein in the 90s but Kuwait is </v>
<v Speaker 2>much more than that.</v>

7
00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:30.380
<v Speaker 2>It is one of the most tolerant nations </v>
<v Speaker 2>in the Islamic world's women can vote.</v>

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.410
<v Speaker 2>They can run for office and they even </v>
<v Speaker 2>have a female</v>

9
00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.533
<v Speaker 1>paint</v>

10
00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.850
<v Speaker 2>lots and all of these apps.</v>
<v Speaker 2>For decades,</v>

11
00:00:39.851 --> 00:00:44.230
<v Speaker 2>the Kuwaiti royal family has been </v>
<v Speaker 2>America's best friends in the Gulf.</v>

12
00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.093
<v Speaker 2>This is why when they were invaded in </v>
<v Speaker 2>1990 uncle Sam didn't hesitate for a </v>

13
00:00:48.521 --> 00:00:50.890
<v Speaker 2>moment and sent in their troops </v>
<v Speaker 2>immediately.</v>

14
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.123
<v Speaker 3>This will not stand.</v>
<v Speaker 3>This will not stand this aggression </v>

15
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.600
<v Speaker 3>against a Kuwait.</v>

16
00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.660
<v Speaker 2>Now you might wonder,</v>
<v Speaker 2>why are we talking today about Kuwait?</v>

17
00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.673
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>this is the only Arab country alongside </v>

18
00:01:03.991 --> 00:01:07.900
<v Speaker 2>a man that hasn't joined the diplomatic </v>
<v Speaker 2>of block of Qatar.</v>

19
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:09.703
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

20
00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.030
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Bahrain,</v>

21
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:12.923
<v Speaker 2>Egypt,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and the United Arab Emirates broke off </v>

22
00:01:14.791 --> 00:01:15.624
<v Speaker 2>relations with Qatar in the worst </v>
<v Speaker 2>diplomatic crisis to hit the Gulf Arab </v>

23
00:01:18.961 --> 00:01:19.794
<v Speaker 2>states in decades.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The three Gulf countries and Egypt </v>

24
00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.850
<v Speaker 2>accused Qatar of supporting terrorism </v>
<v Speaker 2>and destabilizing the region and now the</v>

25
00:01:26.851 --> 00:01:27.684
<v Speaker 2>big question is why is Kuwait is not on </v>
<v Speaker 2>this list of nations who have cut ties </v>

26
00:01:31.171 --> 00:01:32.004
<v Speaker 2>with Qatar?</v>
<v Speaker 2>What kind of interest and does this </v>

27
00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:36.750
<v Speaker 2>country have in this diplomatic crisis?</v>
<v Speaker 2>How does that been?</v>

28
00:01:36.751 --> 00:01:37.584
<v Speaker 2>This has to work well today.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We are going to answer these questions </v>

29
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.363
<v Speaker 2>before we do.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Let's get to know a bit more about this </v>

30
00:01:43.231 --> 00:01:48.231
<v Speaker 2>particular part of the planet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Ooh,</v>

31
00:01:48.411 --> 00:01:49.244
<v Speaker 2>in the Persian Gulf,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the first country we need to know about </v>

32
00:01:51.081 --> 00:01:53.930
<v Speaker 2>in the Arabian peninsula is Saudi </v>
<v Speaker 2>Arabia.</v>

33
00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.320
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia is the biggest country in </v>
<v Speaker 2>the region,</v>

34
00:01:57.321 --> 00:02:00.050
<v Speaker 2>both in terms of population and </v>
<v Speaker 2>territory,</v>

35
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.000
<v Speaker 2>but it is not the only</v>

36
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:02.900
<v Speaker 1>country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yeah,</v>

37
00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.910
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>
<v Speaker 2>We have for United Arab Emirates,</v>

38
00:02:07.911 --> 00:02:12.080
<v Speaker 2>which Dubai and Abu Dhabi are a part of.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This country has its own government,</v>

39
00:02:12.081 --> 00:02:12.914
<v Speaker 2>its own laws and its own currency and </v>
<v Speaker 2>this absolutely independent from the </v>

40
00:02:16.851 --> 00:02:18.770
<v Speaker 2>Saudis.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The same goes for Qatar,</v>

41
00:02:18.771 --> 00:02:19.604
<v Speaker 2>which has its own foreign policy and </v>
<v Speaker 2>holds better public relations with </v>

42
00:02:22.371 --> 00:02:25.550
<v Speaker 2>enemies of the Saudis like the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 2>Republic of Iran.</v>

43
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.253
<v Speaker 2>And now you might be thinking that all </v>
<v Speaker 2>of these countries have one important </v>

44
00:02:31.841 --> 00:02:32.674
<v Speaker 2>thing in common.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The fact that they are all incredibly </v>

45
00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:36.790
<v Speaker 2>oil rich,</v>
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>

46
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.740
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>actually that's pretty wrong.</v>

47
00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.880
<v Speaker 2>Here we have the Republic of Yemen,</v>
<v Speaker 2>a country that is extremely poor.</v>

48
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.870
<v Speaker 2>Now of course it will if these countries</v>
<v Speaker 2>have a common history,</v>

49
00:02:48.871 --> 00:02:52.740
<v Speaker 2>common traditions as well as religion,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but make no mistake,</v>

50
00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.320
<v Speaker 2>each of them have their own </v>
<v Speaker 2>peculiarities.</v>

51
00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.273
<v Speaker 2>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the United Arab Emirates was the first </v>

52
00:02:57.871 --> 00:02:58.704
<v Speaker 2>country who realized oil is not forever </v>
<v Speaker 2>and therefore they decided to diversify </v>

53
00:03:02.691 --> 00:03:04.420
<v Speaker 2>their economy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so they accrued,</v>

54
00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:05.254
<v Speaker 2>represents just 3% of the total economy </v>
<v Speaker 2>of Cuba is also a totally different </v>

55
00:03:11.871 --> 00:03:12.710
<v Speaker 2>animal.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

56
00:03:12.711 --> 00:03:14.780
<v Speaker 2>they have a monarchy,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called apnea,</v>

57
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.420
<v Speaker 2>but he is controlled buying eight </v>
<v Speaker 2>constitution.</v>

58
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.510
<v Speaker 2>The parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

59
00:03:21.511 --> 00:03:22.344
<v Speaker 2>hold on for just a second because this </v>
<v Speaker 2>doesn't mean they are a 100% democratic </v>

60
00:03:26.131 --> 00:03:26.941
<v Speaker 2>country.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>

61
00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:29.370
<v Speaker 2>their system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's way more complicated than that.</v>

62
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.380
<v Speaker 2>So,</v>
<v Speaker 2>well that's,</v>

63
00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.290
<v Speaker 2>I'm looking at it now.</v>

64
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.103
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.960
<v Speaker 2>Does semi democracy work in Kuwait?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kuwait is known as a semi democracy.</v>

66
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:47.590
<v Speaker 2>I'm like Saudi Arabia.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kuwait has a freedom of religion.</v>

67
00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:51.600
<v Speaker 2>This is why you can even find a catholic</v>
<v Speaker 2>church in the middle of Kuwait</v>

68
00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.553
<v Speaker 1>City.</v>

69
00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.163
<v Speaker 2>Things like the hit job on north </v>
<v Speaker 2>mandatory and even the laws regarding </v>

70
00:03:59.081 --> 00:03:59.914
<v Speaker 2>alcohol.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Beth fairly liberal in comparison with </v>

71
00:04:01.841 --> 00:04:03.960
<v Speaker 2>their neighbors.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course it's still forbidden.</v>

72
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.230
<v Speaker 2>Nz buy and sell alcohol,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but it is legal to drink in privates.</v>

73
00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.123
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the main peculiarity about Kuwait are </v>

74
00:04:10.841 --> 00:04:13.540
<v Speaker 2>their elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>All the adult natural born citizens have</v>

75
00:04:13.541 --> 00:04:15.850
<v Speaker 2>the right to vote their parliament every</v>
<v Speaker 2>four years.</v>

76
00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:18.520
<v Speaker 2>This includes women in these elections.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Political parties are</v>

77
00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.490
<v Speaker 1>a bit,</v>
<v Speaker 1>doesn't it</v>

78
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:22.583
<v Speaker 2>mean candidates have no ideology at all?</v>
<v Speaker 2>They can also campaign freely and have </v>

79
00:04:25.831 --> 00:04:27.210
<v Speaker 2>debates.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Needless to say,</v>

80
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.073
<v Speaker 2>the political debate here is totally </v>
<v Speaker 2>different compared to that in the UK or </v>

81
00:04:31.651 --> 00:04:32.484
<v Speaker 2>the u s yeah,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the political spectrum is not only a </v>

82
00:04:34.711 --> 00:04:35.544
<v Speaker 2>right wing or left wing kind of thing.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course some kinds of ads are highly </v>

83
00:04:38.281 --> 00:04:40.860
<v Speaker 2>conservative and others are more liberal</v>
<v Speaker 2>and open.</v>

84
00:04:40.861 --> 00:04:41.700
<v Speaker 2>Z Western culture</v>

85
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.593
<v Speaker 1>sure</v>

86
00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:47.360
<v Speaker 2>is not the only thing that divides </v>
<v Speaker 2>Kuwaiti society.</v>

87
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.380
<v Speaker 2>There is also this never ending fights </v>
<v Speaker 2>between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims.</v>

88
00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.360
<v Speaker 2>This is because,</v>
<v Speaker 2>as I said before,</v>

89
00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:54.253
<v Speaker 2>that is freedom of religion and that </v>
<v Speaker 2>means the creed of the candidates is as </v>

90
00:04:58.041 --> 00:05:00.700
<v Speaker 2>important as his tax plan.</v>
<v Speaker 2>There's Mazzoni.</v>

91
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:05.530
<v Speaker 2>That bear is a nother big divide between</v>
<v Speaker 2>the so called urban voters am's,</v>

92
00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:08.690
<v Speaker 2>the so called tribal once.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Just think about it for a moment.</v>

93
00:05:08.691 --> 00:05:09.524
<v Speaker 2>This is a country with a long nomadic </v>
<v Speaker 2>tradition with half of the population </v>

94
00:05:13.281 --> 00:05:14.114
<v Speaker 2>still living in tribes and these tribes </v>
<v Speaker 2>that own primaries to choose that own </v>

95
00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.860
<v Speaker 2>candles.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well said.</v>

96
00:05:25.570 --> 00:05:30.300
<v Speaker 2>Elections are used to choose a national </v>
<v Speaker 2>assembly with the power to make laws and</v>

97
00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.510
<v Speaker 2>even put a veto on the policies taken by</v>
<v Speaker 2>the executive branch.</v>

98
00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:36.730
<v Speaker 2>But now you might be wondering how old </v>
<v Speaker 2>are the trees,</v>

99
00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.593
<v Speaker 2>the prime minister,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all they voted for by mds as they do a </v>

100
00:05:39.851 --> 00:05:40.684
<v Speaker 2>European countries or do they hold </v>
<v Speaker 2>presidential elections like they do in </v>

101
00:05:43.241 --> 00:05:43.930
<v Speaker 2>the US?</v>

102
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.890
<v Speaker 4>Sorry.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Well</v>

103
00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:48.980
<v Speaker 2>it's actually nothing like either of </v>
<v Speaker 2>those.</v>

104
00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:52.040
<v Speaker 2>As I said,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kuwait is a semiotic democracy.</v>

105
00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.053
<v Speaker 2>This means that the head of state is the</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amea and he chooses the prime minister </v>

106
00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.493
<v Speaker 2>and his,</v>
<v Speaker 2>so maybe this sounds like those </v>

107
00:05:59.421 --> 00:06:00.470
<v Speaker 2>European.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Absolutely.</v>

108
00:06:00.471 --> 00:06:03.170
<v Speaker 2>Monica is that you studied about in </v>
<v Speaker 2>history lessons?</v>

109
00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:05.870
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>it's not really exactly like that.</v>

110
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.190
<v Speaker 2>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 2>in Arab monarchies,</v>

111
00:06:07.191 --> 00:06:08.024
<v Speaker 2>the position of India is not inherited.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is why in Saudi Arabia they have </v>

112
00:06:11.661 --> 00:06:16.130
<v Speaker 2>big internal battles to choose their </v>
<v Speaker 2>leaders and as I explained in a previous</v>

113
00:06:16.131 --> 00:06:18.710
<v Speaker 2>video,</v>
<v Speaker 2>royal families in this part of the wells</v>

114
00:06:18.711 --> 00:06:20.180
<v Speaker 2>can have thousands of members.</v>

115
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:22.783
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

116
00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.940
<v Speaker 2>So in the case of Kuwait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the members of the royal family,</v>

117
00:06:26.941 --> 00:06:30.150
<v Speaker 2>the so called Al Subar House can vote </v>
<v Speaker 2>for the EMEA,</v>

118
00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:31.163
<v Speaker 2>but right after the national assembly it</v>
<v Speaker 2>has to vote on whether they can accept </v>

119
00:06:34.801 --> 00:06:37.890
<v Speaker 2>this decision or not.</v>
<v Speaker 2>But it's a hold on now for just a second</v>

120
00:06:37.891 --> 00:06:40.650
<v Speaker 2>because just in case the system wasn't </v>
<v Speaker 2>complicated enough.</v>

121
00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.603
<v Speaker 2>Here is another extra fact.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The constitution allows the air to </v>

122
00:06:45.421 --> 00:06:48.600
<v Speaker 2>dissolve the parliaments many time he </v>
<v Speaker 2>wants fans.</v>

123
00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.600
<v Speaker 2>Well that's something he does pretty </v>
<v Speaker 2>often.</v>

124
00:06:54.210 --> 00:06:54.580
<v Speaker 1>Amir</v>

125
00:06:54.580 --> 00:06:55.413
<v Speaker 2>of Kuwait dissolves parliament.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The move announced on state media after </v>

126
00:06:58.841 --> 00:07:02.530
<v Speaker 2>an emergency government meeting sets the</v>
<v Speaker 2>stage for early elections.</v>

127
00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:03.453
<v Speaker 2>And believe me,</v>
<v Speaker 2>parliamentary debates in Kuwait are far </v>

128
00:07:05.801 --> 00:07:06.634
<v Speaker 2>from being quiet.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Emergency meetings are a common thing </v>

129
00:07:08.711 --> 00:07:11.950
<v Speaker 2>and sometimes it's really hard to get </v>
<v Speaker 2>any kind of consensus.</v>

130
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.250
<v Speaker 2>For some analysts.</v>
<v Speaker 2>This is one of the reasons that explains</v>

131
00:07:15.251 --> 00:07:20.251
<v Speaker 2>this.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The halakha economy,</v>

132
00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.823
<v Speaker 2>we all know oil rich countries have so </v>
<v Speaker 2>much money they can spend as if there </v>

133
00:07:25.341 --> 00:07:26.174
<v Speaker 2>was no tomorrow,</v>
<v Speaker 2>most natural born Qac citizens work on </v>

134
00:07:29.221 --> 00:07:32.330
<v Speaker 2>civil sevens for the governments.</v>
<v Speaker 2>They pay no income tax,</v>

135
00:07:32.331 --> 00:07:35.810
<v Speaker 2>their energy bills and subsidized and </v>
<v Speaker 2>best salary as well.</v>

136
00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:37.000
<v Speaker 2>Then neutrik Christie,</v>
<v Speaker 2>yeah.</v>

137
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:37.923
<v Speaker 1>Hi.</v>

138
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:41.630
<v Speaker 2>Do people who work on oil rigs?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

139
00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.523
<v Speaker 2>they're the foreigners,</v>
<v Speaker 2>but this is not only a rihanna see four </v>

140
00:07:45.171 --> 00:07:49.040
<v Speaker 2>key ways it happens all over the region </v>
<v Speaker 2>like goals is allowed to,</v>

141
00:07:49.041 --> 00:07:51.110
<v Speaker 2>all of these countries do enjoy this </v>
<v Speaker 2>way,</v>

142
00:07:51.111 --> 00:07:56.111
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>The question is,</v>

143
00:07:58.951 --> 00:08:00.060
<v Speaker 2>well,</v>
<v Speaker 2>what happens now,</v>

144
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:00.953
<v Speaker 2>as you probably know,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the market price for crude oil has </v>

145
00:08:02.461 --> 00:08:03.294
<v Speaker 2>fallen in recent years.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Of course these oil Monica is are still </v>

146
00:08:06.031 --> 00:08:06.864
<v Speaker 2>making profits but not enough to keep </v>
<v Speaker 2>that system going and this is why today </v>

147
00:08:10.560 --> 00:08:13.140
<v Speaker 2>all of these countries have fiscal </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficits.</v>

148
00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.710
<v Speaker 2>This means they're spending is way </v>
<v Speaker 2>higher than their income.</v>

149
00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:23.840
<v Speaker 1>Hey</v>

150
00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:26.190
<v Speaker 2>to the chart.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even the USA I come through,</v>

151
00:08:26.191 --> 00:08:27.024
<v Speaker 2>which is really worried about his </v>
<v Speaker 2>deficits is doing better than these </v>

152
00:08:29.791 --> 00:08:32.840
<v Speaker 2>countries.</v>
<v Speaker 2>I now you might wonder,</v>

153
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.310
<v Speaker 2>what does this figure actually mean?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

154
00:08:35.340 --> 00:08:39.450
<v Speaker 2>this means that if the Kuwaitis don't </v>
<v Speaker 2>want to go bankrupt in just a few years,</v>

155
00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:41.790
<v Speaker 2>they better find some alternative </v>
<v Speaker 2>incomes,</v>

156
00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:44.760
<v Speaker 2>not rely entirely on oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Nonetheless,</v>

157
00:08:44.761 --> 00:08:47.280
<v Speaker 2>despite two ways,</v>
<v Speaker 2>having the most to modern and democratic</v>

158
00:08:47.281 --> 00:08:48.114
<v Speaker 2>political system,</v>
<v Speaker 2>they have the highest dependence on </v>

159
00:08:50.191 --> 00:08:55.191
<v Speaker 2>crude oil.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Even Saudi Arabia regressive as they all</v>

160
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.250
<v Speaker 2>is better prepared for a plummet in the </v>
<v Speaker 2>price of oil,</v>

161
00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.113
<v Speaker 2>and this is a surprise for everybody </v>
<v Speaker 2>because during the 1970s Kuwait was the </v>

162
00:09:05.530 --> 00:09:06.363
<v Speaker 2>Rockstar of the region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Now this title goes to Dubai despite it </v>

163
00:09:09.561 --> 00:09:11.720
<v Speaker 2>being an absolute monarchy and this is </v>
<v Speaker 2>left him in.</v>

164
00:09:11.721 --> 00:09:15.290
<v Speaker 2>The Arab is wondering whether democracy </v>
<v Speaker 2>is compatible with economics.</v>

165
00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:16.683
<v Speaker 1>Cool.</v>

166
00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:21.840
<v Speaker 2>Wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>has stagnated,</v>

167
00:09:21.841 --> 00:09:26.040
<v Speaker 2>frustrating the people of a country once</v>
<v Speaker 2>seen as a Middle East trailblazer,</v>

168
00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:29.460
<v Speaker 2>let's say that you want to start a </v>
<v Speaker 2>logistics company in Dubai.</v>

169
00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:31.950
<v Speaker 2>You just need to buy some land and build</v>
<v Speaker 2>the facilities,</v>

170
00:09:32.010 --> 00:09:32.940
<v Speaker 2>right?</v>
<v Speaker 2>Well,</v>

171
00:09:32.970 --> 00:09:33.803
<v Speaker 2>in Kuwait this is almost impossible.</v>
<v Speaker 2>The government's owns 90% of the </v>

172
00:09:37.711 --> 00:09:38.544
<v Speaker 2>territory.</v>
<v Speaker 2>On the other hand is bureaucracy as </v>

173
00:09:40.021 --> 00:09:40.854
<v Speaker 2>reached insane levels according to the </v>
<v Speaker 2>world about in kids is easy to get to </v>

174
00:09:43.531 --> 00:09:48.420
<v Speaker 2>start a business in countries like </v>
<v Speaker 2>Ukraine or El Salvador than it is in Qa.</v>

175
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.453
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

176
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.820
<v Speaker 2>and all of this is despite the fact that</v>
<v Speaker 2>Kuwait has a lower corporate tax rate of</v>

177
00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.673
<v Speaker 2>the Luxembourg added to this,</v>
<v Speaker 2>all these sky high salaries of civil </v>

178
00:10:00.281 --> 00:10:02.260
<v Speaker 2>workers,</v>
<v Speaker 2>which rise year after year,</v>

179
00:10:02.410 --> 00:10:03.243
<v Speaker 2>and you can probably imagine that no one</v>
<v Speaker 2>is going to become an entrepreneur and </v>

180
00:10:06.611 --> 00:10:07.444
<v Speaker 2>to leave behind the comfort and safety </v>
<v Speaker 2>of a government job to even the quiches </v>

181
00:10:11.171 --> 00:10:14.700
<v Speaker 2>and transfer the money outside because </v>
<v Speaker 2>they cannot do business.</v>

182
00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.950
<v Speaker 2>They're taught to do the short term,</v>
<v Speaker 2>the short term,</v>

183
00:10:18.310 --> 00:10:19.143
<v Speaker 2>but now all of a sudden the Qatari </v>
<v Speaker 2>crisis has offered Kuwait a chance to </v>

184
00:10:22.061 --> 00:10:25.690
<v Speaker 2>emerge as a regional leader.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Their royal house has good relationships</v>

185
00:10:25.691 --> 00:10:28.930
<v Speaker 2>with all the countries involved,</v>
<v Speaker 2>including the United States,</v>

186
00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.793
<v Speaker 2>Saudi Arabia and Qatar plus step </v>
<v Speaker 2>analytical system is the most open and </v>

187
00:10:35.281 --> 00:10:37.230
<v Speaker 2>democratic in the region.</v>
<v Speaker 2>In other words,</v>

188
00:10:37.260 --> 00:10:41.190
<v Speaker 2>they have the best chance of becoming a </v>
<v Speaker 2>mediator in this crisis.</v>

189
00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:46.390
<v Speaker 2>And they're well aware of wait,</v>
<v Speaker 2>Amir to travel to Saudi for Qatar talks.</v>

190
00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:50.690
<v Speaker 2>It's like,</v>
<v Speaker 2>now the question becomes,</v>

191
00:10:50.691 --> 00:10:54.440
<v Speaker 2>do you think Kuwait's can take back its </v>
<v Speaker 2>role as a regional leader?</v>

192
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.250
<v Speaker 2>Can this crisis help them to showcase </v>
<v Speaker 2>that country for foreign investments?</v>

193
00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.233
