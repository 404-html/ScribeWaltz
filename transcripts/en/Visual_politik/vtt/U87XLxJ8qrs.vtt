1
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.443
<v Speaker 1>In recent decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it has been normal to consider the </v>

2
00:00:10.741 --> 00:00:11.574
<v Speaker 1>tenants of the White House,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of the United States has </v>

3
00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:18.981
<v Speaker 1>the most powerful person in the world </v>
<v Speaker 1>give you a things they might be changing</v>

4
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.270
<v Speaker 1>or maybe they've actually already </v>
<v Speaker 1>changed.</v>

5
00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.890
<v Speaker 1>Have you heard about the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>presidents?</v>

6
00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:34.733
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>of course you have because I'm sure </v>

7
00:00:35.511 --> 00:00:38.300
<v Speaker 1>you're a very avid visual politic view </v>
<v Speaker 1>app now.</v>

8
00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.134
<v Speaker 1>You see Donald Trump himself in </v>
<v Speaker 1>statements collected by the Washington </v>

9
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:42.523
<v Speaker 1>Post describes the Chinese president,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping as the most powerful leader </v>

10
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:46.753
<v Speaker 1>that China has had in the last century,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is as good as saying that Xi </v>

11
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.610
<v Speaker 1>Jinping is the most powerful Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>leader of all time.</v>

12
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.763
<v Speaker 1>More and more analysts wondering if he </v>
<v Speaker 1>isn't in fact the most powerful </v>

13
00:01:00.841 --> 00:01:03.000
<v Speaker 1>political leader in the world.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

14
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.240
<v Speaker 1>it's true now while trying is economy </v>
<v Speaker 1>and its army are still on a second level</v>

15
00:01:07.241 --> 00:01:08.074
<v Speaker 1>of to the United States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump seems to consistently be losing </v>

16
00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.980
<v Speaker 1>his influence over the world and indeed </v>
<v Speaker 1>his own country,</v>

17
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.130
<v Speaker 1>and so when you go over to China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you can see that the situation is pretty</v>

18
00:01:17.131 --> 00:01:18.930
<v Speaker 1>much the opposite.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We'll wait,</v>

19
00:01:18.931 --> 00:01:19.321
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>

20
00:01:19.321 --> 00:01:19.620
<v Speaker 1>wait,</v>
<v Speaker 1>wait.</v>

21
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:21.750
<v Speaker 1>Trump is losing his influence in the US.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>

22
00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:24.030
<v Speaker 1>how could this possibly be the case?</v>
<v Speaker 1>He wants to be.</v>

23
00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:24.864
<v Speaker 1>Everyone's friends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Have one scene is rather sweet tweets </v>

24
00:01:26.901 --> 00:01:27.734
<v Speaker 1>lately.</v>

25
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:31.763
<v Speaker 1>Why would Kim Jong UN insult me by </v>
<v Speaker 1>calling me old when I would never call </v>

26
00:01:35.491 --> 00:01:36.810
<v Speaker 1>him short and fat?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Oh,</v>

27
00:01:36.811 --> 00:01:39.480
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>I try so hard to be his friend and maybe</v>

28
00:01:39.481 --> 00:01:41.040
<v Speaker 1>someday that will happen.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>

29
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.903
<v Speaker 1>It's definitely no surprise that the </v>
<v Speaker 1>United States is losing its influence </v>

30
00:01:44.611 --> 00:01:45.444
<v Speaker 1>over the world in just a few months.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has gone from nuclear war to </v>

31
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.220
<v Speaker 1>school,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the odd fights.</v>

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.000
<v Speaker 1>All right.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Anyway,</v>

33
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.700
<v Speaker 1>back to the serious stuff.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fact is that although Tszujing thing</v>

34
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>isn't the president of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>leading power,</v>

35
00:01:55.921 --> 00:01:58.500
<v Speaker 1>he does control China's leadership </v>
<v Speaker 1>tightly,</v>

36
00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.440
<v Speaker 1>a country which is one of the most </v>
<v Speaker 1>important economic engines on the</v>

37
00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:03.783
<v Speaker 2>onyx.</v>

38
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.703
<v Speaker 1>Of course for Beijing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Trump has been something like the </v>

39
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.853
<v Speaker 1>lottery Jackpot.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nationalism and Donald Trump's mistakes </v>

40
00:02:18.481 --> 00:02:19.314
<v Speaker 1>have allowed Xi Jinping,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president of the world's largest </v>

41
00:02:21.631 --> 00:02:22.464
<v Speaker 1>dictatorship to present his candidacy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has this sort of global political </v>

42
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:26.700
<v Speaker 1>leader.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In January,</v>

43
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.534
<v Speaker 1>2017 of the Davis Forum,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping promised that China would </v>

44
00:02:30.601 --> 00:02:33.600
<v Speaker 1>become nothing less than the champion of</v>
<v Speaker 1>globalization,</v>

45
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.930
<v Speaker 1>of free trade and even the fight against</v>
<v Speaker 1>climate change,</v>

46
00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.823
<v Speaker 1>thus Beijing aspirants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but its grasp on the terrain that has </v>

47
00:02:40.111 --> 00:02:45.111
<v Speaker 1>been lost by watching it to mention,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

48
00:02:46.231 --> 00:02:47.064
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>freedom and so all those other sorts of </v>

49
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.790
<v Speaker 1>apparently unimportant things,</v>

50
00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.470
<v Speaker 3>Adi,</v>
<v Speaker 3>by,</v>

51
00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.810
<v Speaker 3>by the sun,</v>
<v Speaker 3>Shins are,</v>

52
00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.870
<v Speaker 3>you'll push out and</v>

53
00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.843
<v Speaker 1>comes off.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now what happened in the last Chinese </v>

54
00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.473
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party Congress,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how much power does Xi Jinping have and </v>

55
00:03:09.491 --> 00:03:10.630
<v Speaker 1>what does he wants?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

56
00:03:10.631 --> 00:03:13.270
<v Speaker 1>we're going to discuss all of this,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but first,</v>

57
00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.640
<v Speaker 1>let's take a look at China today,</v>

58
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.150
<v Speaker 2>but new China.</v>

59
00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:27.923
<v Speaker 1>You think that China is still a country </v>
<v Speaker 1>where people live in deplorable </v>

60
00:03:30.001 --> 00:03:30.834
<v Speaker 1>conditions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>breaking them backs been miserable </v>

61
00:03:32.461 --> 00:03:33.390
<v Speaker 1>wages.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

62
00:03:33.391 --> 00:03:34.224
<v Speaker 1>I'm sorry,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the reality is you're actually </v>

63
00:03:34.921 --> 00:03:35.754
<v Speaker 1>pretty wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If you think that 2018 will be the 40th </v>

64
00:03:38.131 --> 00:03:41.610
<v Speaker 1>anniversary of China's reform and open </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy in this country.</v>

65
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:46.410
<v Speaker 1>It's changed a lot in that time.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China is no longer a low income country,</v>

66
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.130
<v Speaker 1>but indeed a middle income country</v>

67
00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:49.083
<v Speaker 2>tree</v>

68
00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.930
<v Speaker 1>taking price differences into account is</v>
<v Speaker 1>it that purchasing power parity of about</v>

69
00:03:59.931 --> 00:04:00.764
<v Speaker 1>$16,000,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is bigger than both Columbia and </v>

70
00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:08.680
<v Speaker 1>Brazil,</v>
<v Speaker 1>comedy has changed and nowadays services</v>

71
00:04:10.751 --> 00:04:15.751
<v Speaker 1>are the most important activity example </v>
<v Speaker 1>in electronic commerce,</v>

72
00:04:17.901 --> 00:04:18.734
<v Speaker 1>the sector in which the country is </v>
<v Speaker 1>beating Europe and even the United </v>

73
00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.070
<v Speaker 1>States.</v>
<v Speaker 1>China represents no less than 40 percent</v>

74
00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.993
<v Speaker 1>of all global transactions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The same can be said of a mobile </v>

75
00:04:28.761 --> 00:04:29.594
<v Speaker 1>payments which is so popular in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that it's market reached five </v>

76
00:04:31.881 --> 00:04:32.714
<v Speaker 1>point $5,000,000,000,000 in 2016,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is 50 times more than the United </v>

77
00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.910
<v Speaker 1>States could be described as.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not Bad.</v>

78
00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.830
<v Speaker 1>I mean that growth has been so large,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but just in the last six years,</v>

79
00:04:53.831 --> 00:04:54.664
<v Speaker 1>China's private consumption is growing </v>
<v Speaker 1>by two point $5,000,000,000,000 and </v>

80
00:04:57.171 --> 00:05:00.640
<v Speaker 1>announced that equals India's entire </v>
<v Speaker 1>GDP.</v>

81
00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.533
<v Speaker 1>Therefore,</v>
<v Speaker 1>when you visit one of those giant </v>

82
00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:03.663
<v Speaker 1>Chinese cities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's not at all uncommon to find a city </v>

83
00:05:05.651 --> 00:05:07.900
<v Speaker 1>full of skyscrapers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>billionaires,</v>

84
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.823
<v Speaker 1>and high speed trains.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Hold on just a second because China's </v>

85
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.753
<v Speaker 1>poverty continues and in general,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is a really large difference </v>

86
00:05:15.761 --> 00:05:17.650
<v Speaker 1>between the countries,</v>
<v Speaker 1>cities and the countries,</v>

87
00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.980
<v Speaker 1>rural areas which remained poor,</v>
<v Speaker 1>very poor.</v>

88
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:26.160
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they're so poor that 43 million people,</v>

89
00:05:26.161 --> 00:05:28.770
<v Speaker 1>almost the entire population of Spain,</v>
<v Speaker 1>by the way,</v>

90
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.390
<v Speaker 1>still live in extreme poverty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>earning less than $1 a day,</v>

91
00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:34.313
<v Speaker 1>and not only that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>almost 40 percent of Chinese people </v>

92
00:05:36.361 --> 00:05:37.194
<v Speaker 1>still live at fairly low economic level.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Although the situation is much better </v>

93
00:05:40.741 --> 00:05:41.940
<v Speaker 1>than a few decades ago.</v>

94
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.690
<v Speaker 1>This is all true,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as I said before,</v>

95
00:05:46.691 --> 00:05:47.524
<v Speaker 1>things are changing very quickly and we </v>
<v Speaker 1>can no longer think of China as we did </v>

96
00:05:50.561 --> 00:05:53.030
<v Speaker 1>2010,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even just five years ago.</v>

97
00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:00.110
<v Speaker 2>Way</v>

98
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.250
<v Speaker 1>You talking about poverty is an </v>
<v Speaker 1>interesting fact.</v>

99
00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:06.220
<v Speaker 1>Do you know how the Chinese government </v>
<v Speaker 1>fights against poverty?</v>

100
00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:07.143
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one of its main strategies is actually </v>

101
00:06:08.351 --> 00:06:11.980
<v Speaker 1>creating new businesses and cooperatives</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the poorest of communities.</v>

102
00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.843
<v Speaker 1>To this ends.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The government has granted almost </v>

103
00:06:13.841 --> 00:06:14.674
<v Speaker 1>$400,000,000,000 in small loans to help </v>
<v Speaker 1>launch several companies and they not </v>

104
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.060
<v Speaker 1>only focus on money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but also unculture.</v>

105
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:22.323
<v Speaker 1>The evening news is filled with tales of</v>
<v Speaker 1>rejuvenated communities and villagers </v>

106
00:06:25.451 --> 00:06:26.284
<v Speaker 1>turned entrepreneurs heaping praise on </v>
<v Speaker 1>Mr c dot and the government for </v>

107
00:06:28.841 --> 00:06:32.290
<v Speaker 1>providing loans and new apartments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Javier Hernandez,</v>

108
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.420
<v Speaker 1>China correspondent for the New York </v>
<v Speaker 1>Times.</v>

109
00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:38.081
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes.</v>

110
00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:38.914
<v Speaker 1>I know Xi Jinping in practically every </v>
<v Speaker 1>country leader talk a lot about Chinese </v>

111
00:06:42.521 --> 00:06:43.354
<v Speaker 1>style socialism.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The truth is that this is just a </v>

112
00:06:45.461 --> 00:06:49.030
<v Speaker 1>reference to a kind of capitalist model </v>
<v Speaker 1>locked up within a dictatorship.</v>

113
00:06:49.060 --> 00:06:51.790
<v Speaker 1>China isn't an ideological dictatorship,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Norris,</v>

114
00:06:51.791 --> 00:06:55.330
<v Speaker 1>socialist or communist one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's just simply a dictatorship.</v>

115
00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.223
<v Speaker 1>Having said that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>now let's talk a little bit about aging </v>

116
00:06:58.031 --> 00:06:58.864
<v Speaker 1>thing.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The person leading this new China with </v>

117
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.970
<v Speaker 1>almost total power CGMP,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader</v>

118
00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:16.890
<v Speaker 1>born in 1953.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We could say that Xi Jinping is a pretty</v>

119
00:07:16.891 --> 00:07:18.570
<v Speaker 1>interesting dude.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

120
00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:21.840
<v Speaker 1>he's probably the Chinese leader who's </v>
<v Speaker 1>had the most contact with the West.</v>

121
00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:24.750
<v Speaker 1>His daughter studied at Harvard.</v>
<v Speaker 1>His sister even lives in Canada,</v>

122
00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:27.720
<v Speaker 1>and he has visited the United States </v>
<v Speaker 1>several times.</v>

123
00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:28.613
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in 2012 when he visited the United </v>

124
00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:34.140
<v Speaker 1>States as vice president of China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he made a somewhat peculiar stop.</v>

125
00:07:34.141 --> 00:07:35.730
<v Speaker 1>He went to Iowa.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

126
00:07:35.731 --> 00:07:37.050
<v Speaker 1>at this point you're probably wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

127
00:07:37.051 --> 00:07:38.550
<v Speaker 1>why did he go to Iowa?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

128
00:07:38.551 --> 00:07:41.670
<v Speaker 1>the fact is that in 1985 when she drink </v>
<v Speaker 1>thing was a young party,</v>

129
00:07:41.671 --> 00:07:42.504
<v Speaker 1>county secretary in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he traveled to Iowa to investigate </v>

130
00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:45.743
<v Speaker 1>agriculture related issues,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so in 2010 we went to see the family </v>

131
00:07:48.751 --> 00:07:51.690
<v Speaker 1>that had stayed with at the time and he </v>
<v Speaker 1>brought them presence.</v>

132
00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:52.620
<v Speaker 1>Pretty cool,</v>
<v Speaker 1>right?</v>

133
00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.790
<v Speaker 1>In addition,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the president,</v>

134
00:07:53.791 --> 00:07:56.040
<v Speaker 1>she's Yankee side.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It doesn't end there.</v>

135
00:07:56.070 --> 00:07:58.530
<v Speaker 1>He's also known to love Hollywood </v>
<v Speaker 1>movies.</v>

136
00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.920
<v Speaker 1>There is also another side to this since</v>
<v Speaker 1>he became China's highest authority five</v>

137
00:08:04.921 --> 00:08:05.754
<v Speaker 1>years ago because government has been </v>
<v Speaker 1>characterized for having the most </v>

138
00:08:07.831 --> 00:08:10.860
<v Speaker 1>censorship and repression for a very </v>
<v Speaker 1>long time.</v>

139
00:08:10.890 --> 00:08:13.980
<v Speaker 1>We only need to take a look at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>latest cybersecurity law,</v>

140
00:08:13.981 --> 00:08:14.814
<v Speaker 1>which seeks to control even more of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Internet in China by restricting </v>

141
00:08:17.911 --> 00:08:22.140
<v Speaker 1>anonymity in doing this is to such an </v>
<v Speaker 1>extent that also social network accounts</v>

142
00:08:22.141 --> 00:08:25.260
<v Speaker 1>have to be backed by ANA identifying </v>
<v Speaker 1>citizen further.</v>

143
00:08:25.261 --> 00:08:28.050
<v Speaker 1>It's been decades since China saw such a</v>
<v Speaker 1>strong leader.</v>

144
00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:29.680
<v Speaker 1>We could say that all this propaganda as</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

145
00:08:29.681 --> 00:08:30.514
<v Speaker 1>it greatly,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's not really surprising now is </v>

146
00:08:32.251 --> 00:08:33.084
<v Speaker 1>that</v>

147
00:08:38.730 --> 00:08:39.030
<v Speaker 2>the fact</v>

148
00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:39.863
<v Speaker 1>is that in these five years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping has made several changes in </v>

149
00:08:42.331 --> 00:08:46.590
<v Speaker 1>China starting with the army reform and </v>
<v Speaker 1>they're very active foreign policy.</v>

150
00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:47.483
<v Speaker 1>We saw it here at visual politic,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how Xi Jingping has done invested </v>

151
00:08:49.921 --> 00:08:52.110
<v Speaker 1>national resources towards foreign </v>
<v Speaker 1>policy.</v>

152
00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.003
<v Speaker 1>A good example is this new silk road </v>
<v Speaker 1>macro project which aims to invest </v>

153
00:08:55.801 --> 00:08:58.620
<v Speaker 1>hundreds of billions of dollars in </v>
<v Speaker 1>several countries,</v>

154
00:08:58.650 --> 00:08:59.483
<v Speaker 1>but generally that greatest commitments </v>
<v Speaker 1>has definitely been the fight against </v>

155
00:09:02.881 --> 00:09:05.150
<v Speaker 1>corruption and this is seriously,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yeah,</v>

156
00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:07.483
<v Speaker 2>sure.</v>

157
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:08.393
<v Speaker 1>Aging thing came to power.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If a one and a half million members of </v>

158
00:09:10.351 --> 00:09:11.184
<v Speaker 1>the Communist Party have been sanctioned</v>
<v Speaker 1>and nearly 300,000 different </v>

159
00:09:14.660 --> 00:09:15.493
<v Speaker 1>prosecutors,</v>
<v Speaker 1>including 43 members of the central </v>

160
00:09:17.611 --> 00:09:18.444
<v Speaker 1>committee,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's more within the framework of </v>

161
00:09:19.921 --> 00:09:22.620
<v Speaker 1>this fight against corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>$13,000.</v>

162
00:09:22.630 --> 00:09:23.463
<v Speaker 1>The officers have been dismissed and </v>
<v Speaker 1>it's more than 50 generals have been in </v>

163
00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:27.720
<v Speaker 1>prisons.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

164
00:09:27.721 --> 00:09:28.554
<v Speaker 1>as you might expect.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Not everyone sees this battle as clean </v>

165
00:09:30.571 --> 00:09:31.404
<v Speaker 1>and honest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's a selective anticorruption </v>

166
00:09:34.201 --> 00:09:35.034
<v Speaker 1>campaign.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's nature is the selective protection </v>

167
00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:39.480
<v Speaker 1>of corruption.</v>
<v Speaker 1>When you purge some corrupt officials,</v>

168
00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:40.433
<v Speaker 1>you're protecting the others,</v>
<v Speaker 1>you protect the corrupt system and you </v>

169
00:09:42.691 --> 00:09:46.440
<v Speaker 1>protect correct people who support you </v>
<v Speaker 1>about tall Chinese activist.</v>

170
00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:47.513
<v Speaker 1>Yes.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Xi Jinping has mostly relieved his </v>

171
00:09:49.261 --> 00:09:51.660
<v Speaker 1>political rivals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Coincidence,</v>

172
00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:52.583
<v Speaker 1>of course.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It's very clear that teaching thing has </v>

173
00:09:53.491 --> 00:09:55.560
<v Speaker 1>gained a lot of power in these five </v>
<v Speaker 1>years.</v>

174
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.280
<v Speaker 1>This was certainly observed in the last </v>
<v Speaker 1>Chinese Communist Party Congress,</v>

175
00:09:59.281 --> 00:10:01.410
<v Speaker 1>the most important political event in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the country,</v>

176
00:10:01.440 --> 00:10:03.000
<v Speaker 1>which is held every five years.</v>

177
00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:03.863
<v Speaker 2>Yes,</v>

178
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.290
<v Speaker 1>19th congress.</v>

179
00:10:13.650 --> 00:10:14.483
<v Speaker 1>The Chinese Communist Party,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Congress held between October the 18th </v>

180
00:10:17.061 --> 00:10:17.894
<v Speaker 1>and 24th 2017 was quite peculiar,</v>
<v Speaker 1>especially because it may have been the </v>

181
00:10:21.801 --> 00:10:25.880
<v Speaker 1>most austere congress that the Chinese </v>
<v Speaker 1>Communist Party is celebrated in many,</v>

182
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:27.680
<v Speaker 1>many years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On this occasion,</v>

183
00:10:27.681 --> 00:10:29.670
<v Speaker 1>some amenities,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they were removed out.</v>

184
00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.620
<v Speaker 1>Some examples.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

185
00:10:30.621 --> 00:10:33.490
<v Speaker 1>among other things,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there was no lavish buffets.</v>

186
00:10:33.530 --> 00:10:36.680
<v Speaker 1>There was no hairdressing facials and </v>
<v Speaker 1>tailoring services.</v>

187
00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:38.990
<v Speaker 1>I mean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>all of these used to be offered for free</v>

188
00:10:38.991 --> 00:10:41.390
<v Speaker 1>to participants and it's almost become a</v>
<v Speaker 1>tradition,</v>

189
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:42.253
<v Speaker 1>but if this was the congress at which Xi</v>
<v Speaker 1>Jinping's adoration reached its highest </v>

190
00:10:46.131 --> 00:10:47.390
<v Speaker 1>point,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something that,</v>

191
00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.313
<v Speaker 1>as you can imagine in China,</v>
<v Speaker 1>means being put on an almost now like </v>

192
00:10:51.471 --> 00:10:54.380
<v Speaker 1>level years ago.</v>

193
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:57.500
<v Speaker 1>I said he would be China's most powerful</v>
<v Speaker 1>leader since dms helping.</v>

194
00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:58.513
<v Speaker 1>I was wrong.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He is now China's most powerful leader </v>

195
00:11:00.331 --> 00:11:04.460
<v Speaker 1>since Kevin Rudd,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Australia's former prime minister.</v>

196
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:05.353
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this congress led to the decision that </v>

197
00:11:06.651 --> 00:11:07.484
<v Speaker 1>these so called Xi Jinping thought </v>
<v Speaker 1>should be included in the communist </v>

198
00:11:10.551 --> 00:11:14.030
<v Speaker 1>party constitution.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This may seem a bit strange,</v>

199
00:11:14.031 --> 00:11:17.390
<v Speaker 1>but it actually means that Xi Jinping is</v>
<v Speaker 1>no longer just another leader.</v>

200
00:11:17.391 --> 00:11:18.224
<v Speaker 1>He is in fact the leader,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the leader whose words formed the </v>

201
00:11:21.081 --> 00:11:25.700
<v Speaker 1>parties own ideology.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It means see is essentially unassailable</v>

202
00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:26.780
<v Speaker 1>if you challenge.</v>
<v Speaker 1>See,</v>

203
00:11:26.830 --> 00:11:27.663
<v Speaker 1>you are challenging the party and you </v>
<v Speaker 1>would never want to be against the </v>

204
00:11:29.391 --> 00:11:30.440
<v Speaker 1>party.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bill Bishop,</v>

205
00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.080
<v Speaker 1>publisher of the Sinocism newsletter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So far,</v>

206
00:11:33.081 --> 00:11:36.110
<v Speaker 1>only males and Dong has received such an</v>
<v Speaker 1>honor in life,</v>

207
00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:36.973
<v Speaker 1>but that's not all.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Apparently a president's mandate is </v>

208
00:11:38.661 --> 00:11:39.494
<v Speaker 1>limited to 10 years,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which means that this would be Xi </v>

209
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:43.740
<v Speaker 1>Jinping's last time,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but during the military,</v>

210
00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:46.700
<v Speaker 1>because no successor was considered </v>
<v Speaker 1>during the congress,</v>

211
00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:47.563
<v Speaker 1>which leads us to believe that Xi </v>
<v Speaker 1>Jinping may be at least aspiring to a </v>

212
00:11:51.111 --> 00:11:51.944
<v Speaker 1>third term Chinese universities </v>
<v Speaker 1>scrambled to open centers to study </v>

213
00:11:59.401 --> 00:12:01.800
<v Speaker 1>president and Ping thought,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but anyway,</v>

214
00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.693
<v Speaker 1>but he owns the Chinese border.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This congress helps define three major </v>

215
00:12:05.461 --> 00:12:07.980
<v Speaker 1>priorities for the Chinese government in</v>
<v Speaker 1>upcoming years.</v>

216
00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:09.180
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the economy,</v>

217
00:12:09.181 --> 00:12:12.100
<v Speaker 1>which means fighting poverty and opening</v>
<v Speaker 1>up more to the world.</v>

218
00:12:12.150 --> 00:12:12.983
<v Speaker 1>Seconds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's the idea of launching even </v>

219
00:12:14.311 --> 00:12:16.440
<v Speaker 1>stronger foreign policies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And third,</v>

220
00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:19.270
<v Speaker 1>start worrying about the environments </v>
<v Speaker 1>and you know,</v>

221
00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.123
<v Speaker 1>even though I said there were three </v>
<v Speaker 1>priorities that is kind of a fourth and </v>

222
00:12:22.621 --> 00:12:23.454
<v Speaker 1>it's actually a pretty clear one.</v>
<v Speaker 1>And that's consolidate the communist </v>

223
00:12:26.041 --> 00:12:26.930
<v Speaker 1>party's power.</v>

224
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:33.930
<v Speaker 1>And this is because we know two things </v>
<v Speaker 1>for sure on the one hand that Xi Jinping</v>

225
00:12:33.931 --> 00:12:36.990
<v Speaker 1>and the Chinese Communist Party will </v>
<v Speaker 1>stay for a long time.</v>

226
00:12:37.050 --> 00:12:37.883
<v Speaker 1>And on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>China will reclaim its role as a </v>

227
00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:42.120
<v Speaker 1>superpower.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So the reality is we're going to have to</v>

228
00:12:42.121 --> 00:12:45.390
<v Speaker 1>get used to taking Beijing into accounts</v>
<v Speaker 1>and now it's your turn.</v>

229
00:12:45.391 --> 00:12:47.790
<v Speaker 1>We've got an important question.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Who Do you think will leave power first?</v>

230
00:12:47.791 --> 00:12:50.370
<v Speaker 1>Will it be Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

231

<v Speaker 1>you can leave your answer in the </v>
