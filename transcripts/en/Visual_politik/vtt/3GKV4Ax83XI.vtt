1
00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.790
<v Speaker 1>So everyone knows that Santa Claus lives</v>
<v Speaker 1>at the North Pole,</v>

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:03.683
<v Speaker 1>more specifically,</v>
<v Speaker 1>he actually lives in these full bod </v>

3
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.263
<v Speaker 1>archipelago,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is the northern most human </v>

4
00:00:07.771 --> 00:00:08.604
<v Speaker 1>settlement in the world is the only </v>
<v Speaker 1>place on earth where you don't need a </v>

5
00:00:20.171 --> 00:00:21.460
<v Speaker 1>visa to ends up.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

6
00:00:21.461 --> 00:00:25.960
<v Speaker 1>there are 2,600 inhabitants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>must be totally self sufficient and they</v>

7
00:00:25.961 --> 00:00:28.710
<v Speaker 1>also have to carry a gun whenever they </v>
<v Speaker 1>leave the main town.</v>

8
00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.530
<v Speaker 1>This isn't a defending themselves from </v>
<v Speaker 1>each other,</v>

9
00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.020
<v Speaker 1>but rather to defend themselves from the</v>
<v Speaker 1>polar bears,</v>

10
00:00:38.021 --> 00:00:38.854
<v Speaker 1>which tends to roam around the region.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Bones which belongs to the Kingdom of </v>

11
00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:42.903
<v Speaker 1>Norway,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the hot spot of a political dispute </v>

12
00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:45.940
<v Speaker 1>with Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Interestingly,</v>

13
00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:50.470
<v Speaker 1>this frozen region has a pretty good </v>
<v Speaker 1>chance of becoming the next Dubai,</v>

14
00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.190
<v Speaker 1>although certainly not when it comes to </v>
<v Speaker 1>the web,</v>

15
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.080
<v Speaker 1>Svalbard has one of the biggest oil beds</v>
<v Speaker 1>in the world.</v>

16
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.973
<v Speaker 1>Further,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are the gateway to the Arctic </v>

17
00:01:00.181 --> 00:01:01.014
<v Speaker 1>routes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which might just become one of the most </v>

18
00:01:02.401 --> 00:01:04.920
<v Speaker 1>important pathways for international </v>
<v Speaker 1>trade.</v>

19
00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.740
<v Speaker 1>And this is why small bond is more than </v>
<v Speaker 1>an ordinary territorial disputes.</v>

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.140
<v Speaker 2>We're talking about a potential new cold</v>
<v Speaker 2>war involving the United States,</v>

21
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:22.063
<v Speaker 2>Canada and even China,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and today that's the story we're going </v>

22
00:01:25.121 --> 00:01:25.954
<v Speaker 2>to tell you about</v>

23
00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.593
<v Speaker 1>once.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Imagine alarms with open doors for </v>

24
00:01:35.731 --> 00:01:37.470
<v Speaker 1>immigrants,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where they come from.</v>

25
00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:38.363
<v Speaker 1>A place where a military presence is </v>
<v Speaker 1>forbidden because it's a demilitarized </v>

26
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.053
<v Speaker 1>zone.</v>
<v Speaker 1>A place which is a fiscal haven has the </v>

27
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:46.680
<v Speaker 1>average salary of Norway.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

28
00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.940
<v Speaker 1>this place that exists,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and it's called SFO boss Andy.</v>

29
00:01:49.941 --> 00:01:51.510
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's at the North Pole.</v>

30
00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.430
<v Speaker 1>Also,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if you want to go to svalbard bad,</v>

31
00:01:53.431 --> 00:01:55.920
<v Speaker 1>there's no need to worry about catching </v>
<v Speaker 1>a cold or the flu.</v>

32
00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.873
<v Speaker 1>The extremely cold temperatures make it </v>
<v Speaker 1>impossible for viruses and bacteria to </v>

33
00:01:59.521 --> 00:02:03.210
<v Speaker 1>stay.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Didn't that cap?</v>

34
00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.100
<v Speaker 1>It's a long year.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The and you can find the world's biggest</v>

35
00:02:06.101 --> 00:02:06.934
<v Speaker 1>sneaker collection wants to try cognac </v>
<v Speaker 1>from the 19th century or maybe a </v>

36
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:10.820
<v Speaker 1>whiskey.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

37
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.260
<v Speaker 1>Colin's Burger pub is the place to go,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so let me introduce you to it's owner,</v>

38
00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.290
<v Speaker 1>Steve Dorfman.</v>

39
00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.183
<v Speaker 2>Many,</v>
<v Speaker 2>many different people from many </v>

40
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.440
<v Speaker 2>different nations working with many </v>
<v Speaker 2>different things.</v>

41
00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.293
<v Speaker 2>First of all,</v>
<v Speaker 2>one of the biggest is absolutely the </v>

42
00:02:26.701 --> 00:02:27.534
<v Speaker 2>coal mining company take have been the </v>
<v Speaker 2>coal mining company for 100 years </v>

43
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.783
<v Speaker 2>actually,</v>
<v Speaker 2>and today there is more and more people </v>

44
00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:40.480
<v Speaker 2>working with the tourist business </v>
<v Speaker 2>service like a restaurant,</v>

45
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.440
<v Speaker 2>but also there is a lot of science going</v>
<v Speaker 2>on on a small board,</v>

46
00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:47.463
<v Speaker 1>so at the beginning of the 20th century </v>
<v Speaker 1>that was a no man's land and only some </v>

47
00:02:50.951 --> 00:02:53.320
<v Speaker 1>whale fishing and with daggers at this </v>
<v Speaker 1>place.</v>

48
00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.303
<v Speaker 1>Nevertheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>after the first world war and not all </v>

49
00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:56.374
<v Speaker 1>countries signed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something called the small batch Tracy </v>

50
00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.160
<v Speaker 1>in treaty,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it is written,</v>

51
00:03:00.161 --> 00:03:02.740
<v Speaker 1>the Norway hold sovereignty over the </v>
<v Speaker 1>territory,</v>

52
00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:05.860
<v Speaker 1>bounce them off some restrictions.</v>
<v Speaker 1>For one,</v>

53
00:03:05.861 --> 00:03:07.260
<v Speaker 1>they consented,</v>
<v Speaker 1>met Rami.</v>

54
00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.133
<v Speaker 1>They also can't build a headquarters </v>
<v Speaker 1>already strongholds as they must allow </v>

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.583
<v Speaker 1>every citizen and every company,</v>
<v Speaker 1>no matter where they are from to enter </v>

56
00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:17.560
<v Speaker 1>the island and exploited snapple </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources,</v>

57
00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.970
<v Speaker 1>and this is how to cities were born.</v>
<v Speaker 1>On the one hand,</v>

58
00:03:21.971 --> 00:03:25.840
<v Speaker 1>we have long year billion where the </v>
<v Speaker 1>majority of the population is Norwegian.</v>

59
00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.153
<v Speaker 1>On the other hands,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is Barrons Burg with a Russian </v>

60
00:03:28.811 --> 00:03:30.700
<v Speaker 1>majority.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In both of these cases,</v>

61
00:03:30.701 --> 00:03:32.950
<v Speaker 1>these started as coal mining settlements</v>

62
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.883
<v Speaker 2>that every year there is a or two times </v>
<v Speaker 2>a year there's like a sports contest </v>

63
00:03:37.631 --> 00:03:39.810
<v Speaker 2>between the settlements.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Between bars.</v>

64
00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.193
<v Speaker 3>Yeah.</v>

65
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.140
<v Speaker 1>Tonight you might be wondering where </v>
<v Speaker 1>executives of these mining companies pay</v>

66
00:03:48.141 --> 00:03:49.760
<v Speaker 1>their taxes in Svalbard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

67
00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:52.180
<v Speaker 1>despite being a Norwegian territory this</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall about trees,</v>

68
00:03:52.181 --> 00:03:54.740
<v Speaker 1>he forbids any country from taxing the </v>
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>

69
00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:55.723
<v Speaker 1>This means that citizens pay the minimum</v>
<v Speaker 1>required amount to finance their own </v>

70
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.440
<v Speaker 1>governance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

71
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.433
<v Speaker 1>fall could be considered a fiscal haven.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have no VAT in their corporate tax </v>

72
00:04:04.821 --> 00:04:08.050
<v Speaker 1>goes up to 16 percent,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which is even lower than seeing a pause</v>

73
00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:12.663
<v Speaker 2>the last 10,</v>
<v Speaker 2>15 years have been a lot of people </v>

74
00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.250
<v Speaker 2>coming from many different places.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Today.</v>

75
00:04:17.251 --> 00:04:20.780
<v Speaker 2>There is like 46 different nations </v>
<v Speaker 2>living in,</v>

76
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.570
<v Speaker 2>in settlement along all these different </v>
<v Speaker 2>nations.</v>

77
00:04:24.571 --> 00:04:26.690
<v Speaker 2>Live very good together with each other.</v>
<v Speaker 2>Um,</v>

78
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:27.623
<v Speaker 2>and Namibia we have every year there is </v>
<v Speaker 2>a lawyer as a title on a celebrating </v>

79
00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.170
<v Speaker 2>there you have the Russian and you have </v>
<v Speaker 2>the Swedish one,</v>

80
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.040
<v Speaker 1>but make no mistake.</v>
<v Speaker 1>All those tie,</v>

81
00:04:39.041 --> 00:04:39.874
<v Speaker 1>Russian and Swedish people are not </v>
<v Speaker 1>coming to a folder just for the low </v>

82
00:04:42.071 --> 00:04:44.560
<v Speaker 1>taxes or the coal mines,</v>
<v Speaker 1>as you might imagine,</v>

83
00:04:44.561 --> 00:04:45.394
<v Speaker 1>getting cold from the North Pole to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>rest of the world is pretty expensive </v>

84
00:04:48.191 --> 00:04:49.580
<v Speaker 1>and it's not a very profitable business.</v>

85
00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:50.473
<v Speaker 3>Yes,</v>

86
00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.290
<v Speaker 1>small barred coal mine halts production </v>
<v Speaker 1>and so now you might be wondering,</v>

87
00:04:55.291 --> 00:04:56.124
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>if Kohl's nonprofitable while there so </v>

88
00:04:57.661 --> 00:04:58.494
<v Speaker 1>many people going back,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's probably not for the balmy weather </v>

89
00:05:01.021 --> 00:05:03.750
<v Speaker 1>during winter.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Svalbard has a never ending night.</v>

90
00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:06.870
<v Speaker 1>Weather is not even a single minute of </v>
<v Speaker 1>daylight.</v>

91
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:10.463
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>
<v Speaker 1>several people who live that work in </v>

92
00:05:11.311 --> 00:05:14.070
<v Speaker 1>science research centers,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which are based on the archipelago.</v>

93
00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:15.023
<v Speaker 1>Indeed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>since 2008 Svalbard has hosted the </v>

94
00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:19.650
<v Speaker 1>global seed vault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is a storage location,</v>

95
00:05:19.651 --> 00:05:20.484
<v Speaker 1>people mainly by the bill and Melinda </v>
<v Speaker 1>Gates Foundation and Microsoft in this </v>

96
00:05:23.971 --> 00:05:26.430
<v Speaker 1>vault.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They restored a vast collection of seeds</v>

97
00:05:26.431 --> 00:05:27.264
<v Speaker 1>from most of the plants that exist in </v>
<v Speaker 1>the world in case of a nuclear </v>

98
00:05:29.881 --> 00:05:30.714
<v Speaker 1>holocaust.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Mankind would be able to reply on the </v>

99
00:05:32.131 --> 00:05:34.140
<v Speaker 1>planet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>thanks to this great volt,</v>

100
00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:38.040
<v Speaker 1>but this is still not the reason why </v>
<v Speaker 1>[inaudible] is so important.</v>

101
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:39.810
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is something more interesting than</v>

102
00:05:39.811 --> 00:05:42.540
<v Speaker 1>cold polar bears,</v>
<v Speaker 1>science or even Santa Claus Sense.</v>

103
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:51.000
<v Speaker 1>The Arctic holds an estimated 13 percent</v>
<v Speaker 1>or $90,</v>

104
00:05:51.001 --> 00:05:51.834
<v Speaker 1>billion barrels of the world's </v>
<v Speaker 1>undiscovered conventional oil resources </v>

105
00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:59.120
<v Speaker 1>and 30 percent of its undiscovered </v>
<v Speaker 1>conventional natural gas resources.</v>

106
00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.620
<v Speaker 1>Ah,</v>
<v Speaker 1>yes,</v>

107
00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.020
<v Speaker 1>they have oil.</v>
<v Speaker 1>That's not only that.</v>

108
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.973
<v Speaker 1>Let's imagine for a second that you want</v>
<v Speaker 1>to ship some goods from London to Tokyo </v>

109
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.143
<v Speaker 1>today.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The fullest discreet would be to take </v>

110
00:06:09.111 --> 00:06:09.944
<v Speaker 1>this one,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but imagine you could instead do it </v>

111
00:06:15.361 --> 00:06:20.361
<v Speaker 1>using this room.</v>
<v Speaker 1>You see what's going on here.</v>

112
00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:21.963
<v Speaker 1>This is almost half of the distance.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This means less spending and faster </v>

113
00:06:25.991 --> 00:06:30.070
<v Speaker 1>logistics technology and climate change </v>
<v Speaker 1>are making it possible to travel through</v>

114
00:06:30.071 --> 00:06:30.904
<v Speaker 1>the Arctic Ocean,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and this would be a turning point in </v>

115
00:06:33.431 --> 00:06:37.420
<v Speaker 1>international trade and one day this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>going to be a reality,</v>

116
00:06:37.421 --> 00:06:38.254
<v Speaker 1>and on this day,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Svalbard has the highest chance of </v>

117
00:06:40.211 --> 00:06:41.740
<v Speaker 1>becoming the architect capital.</v>

118
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:47.310
<v Speaker 1>The rest of the islands belonged to </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia and to have no human population.</v>

119
00:06:47.311 --> 00:06:49.890
<v Speaker 1>Greenland's on the other hand,</v>
<v Speaker 1>has a chaotic legal system.</v>

120
00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:53.280
<v Speaker 1>Svalbard has a strong political system </v>
<v Speaker 1>and good infrastructure.</v>

121
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:55.380
<v Speaker 1>The proof is in this very interview with</v>
<v Speaker 1>Steve,</v>

122
00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:59.010
<v Speaker 1>which was conducted through skype,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but do we just a moment because the best</v>

123
00:06:59.011 --> 00:07:00.270
<v Speaker 1>pass,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's yet to come.</v>

124
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.250
<v Speaker 1>The frozen war for the Arctic Arctic oil</v>
<v Speaker 1>is under the seat.</v>

125
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:10.203
<v Speaker 1>This means the above.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The ground lands of Svalbard has no oil </v>

126
00:07:12.851 --> 00:07:14.440
<v Speaker 1>beds,</v>
<v Speaker 1>at least that we know of.</v>

127
00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:18.160
<v Speaker 1>All their wealth is on these so called </v>
<v Speaker 1>continental shelf.</v>

128
00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:19.053
<v Speaker 1>This is the underwater lands maps,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which extends from a continence no </v>

129
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.550
<v Speaker 1>deeper than 200 meters.</v>
<v Speaker 1>According to international law,</v>

130
00:07:24.551 --> 00:07:25.384
<v Speaker 1>the continental shelf belongs to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country that is attached to and of </v>

131
00:07:28.211 --> 00:07:30.610
<v Speaker 1>course this includes all of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>resources beneath,</v>

132
00:07:30.700 --> 00:07:33.910
<v Speaker 1>so it should be the government of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country who decides whether they want to</v>

133
00:07:33.911 --> 00:07:35.670
<v Speaker 1>exploit this resource or what</v>

134
00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:36.583
<v Speaker 3>not,</v>

135
00:07:38.580 --> 00:07:41.090
<v Speaker 1>and yes,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both Norway and small bonds archipelagos</v>

136
00:07:41.091 --> 00:07:44.610
<v Speaker 1>are on the same continental shelf.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Therefore in normal conditions,</v>

137
00:07:44.611 --> 00:07:47.580
<v Speaker 1>the Norwegian government would have </v>
<v Speaker 1>sovereignty over this oil.</v>

138
00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.170
<v Speaker 1>But remember what we said about this </v>
<v Speaker 1>fall.</v>

139
00:07:49.171 --> 00:07:52.980
<v Speaker 1>Barge treating every country can exploit</v>
<v Speaker 1>the resources and Norway.</v>

140
00:07:52.981 --> 00:07:56.310
<v Speaker 1>You can do nothing to stop them.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So what exactly is the problem here?</v>

141
00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.173
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>that's the treaty actually says nothing </v>

142
00:07:58.681 --> 00:08:01.710
<v Speaker 1>about the continental shelf or anything </v>
<v Speaker 1>under the water at all,</v>

143
00:08:01.770 --> 00:08:02.603
<v Speaker 1>at the end of the day when it was signed</v>
<v Speaker 1>and no one was really thinking about </v>

144
00:08:04.531 --> 00:08:06.360
<v Speaker 1>extracting oil from the bottom of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>ocean,</v>

145
00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.390
<v Speaker 1>and this is why news like this makes </v>
<v Speaker 1>people so nervous.</v>

146
00:08:10.950 --> 00:08:13.860
<v Speaker 1>Russia believes no way is violating the </v>
<v Speaker 1>small bird treaty.</v>

147
00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:14.873
<v Speaker 1>When the Norwegian government opens </v>
<v Speaker 1>three blocks for oil drilling in the </v>

148
00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:20.530
<v Speaker 1>Barents Sea close to the Arctic Arctic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Pelican.</v>

149
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.013
<v Speaker 1>In summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Russia says the continental shelf of </v>

150
00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:28.273
<v Speaker 1>small bald.</v>
<v Speaker 1>It shouldn't be ruled by the treaty and </v>

151
00:08:30.131 --> 00:08:30.964
<v Speaker 1>to be exploited by any country,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but nobody claims that since the legal </v>

152
00:08:33.821 --> 00:08:35.830
<v Speaker 1>texts didn't contain anything about </v>
<v Speaker 1>this,</v>

153
00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.723
<v Speaker 1>the oil and the rights to extract it </v>
<v Speaker 1>belong to them and now we come to </v>

154
00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.193
<v Speaker 1>Russia.</v>
<v Speaker 1>I might still be thinking that this </v>

155
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:48.940
<v Speaker 1>North Pole thing,</v>
<v Speaker 1>business more story.</v>

156
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:49.893
<v Speaker 1>One of the things for backup remix and </v>
<v Speaker 1>diplomats to have discussions about </v>

157
00:08:52.451 --> 00:08:54.970
<v Speaker 1>while having dinner,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but the truth is that Vladimir Putin,</v>

158
00:08:55.410 --> 00:08:57.530
<v Speaker 1>vice prime minister Dmitry ragas </v>
<v Speaker 1>intimate,</v>

159
00:08:57.630 --> 00:08:59.610
<v Speaker 1>a controversial visit to the </v>
<v Speaker 1>archipelago.</v>

160
00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.880
<v Speaker 4>It's the Cold War in the Arctic.</v>
<v Speaker 4>Russia says it's deputy prime minister.</v>

161
00:09:03.881 --> 00:09:07.330
<v Speaker 4>Had every right to visit a Norwegian </v>
<v Speaker 4>island near the North Pole,</v>

162
00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:11.470
<v Speaker 4>despite travel restrictions imposed on </v>
<v Speaker 4>him over the conflict in Ukraine,</v>

163
00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:14.950
<v Speaker 4>Norway has condemned the trip and ask </v>
<v Speaker 4>for an explanation.</v>

164
00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:18.513
<v Speaker 1>This visit turns fall bald in we </v>
<v Speaker 1>fashionable tourist destination about </v>

165
00:09:21.461 --> 00:09:23.770
<v Speaker 1>the Russians and the last two years it's</v>
<v Speaker 1>fall bumps.</v>

166
00:09:23.771 --> 00:09:26.740
<v Speaker 1>Tourism has increased 100 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

167
00:09:26.741 --> 00:09:29.770
<v Speaker 1>as I mentioned at the beginning that all</v>
<v Speaker 1>to villages on the main islands.</v>

168
00:09:29.771 --> 00:09:31.810
<v Speaker 1>One is Norwegian ends,</v>
<v Speaker 1>one is Russian,</v>

169
00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.673
<v Speaker 1>the Russian one is gold Barron's bag and</v>
<v Speaker 1>there's a population of less than 500 </v>

170
00:09:35.681 --> 00:09:36.880
<v Speaker 1>people.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Incredibly.</v>

171
00:09:36.881 --> 00:09:41.470
<v Speaker 1>In 2015 alone,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they had more than 60,000 tourists.</v>

172
00:09:41.471 --> 00:09:42.031
<v Speaker 1>Visited.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Designer.</v>

173
00:09:42.031 --> 00:09:42.864
<v Speaker 1>Yeah.</v>

174
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:46.230
<v Speaker 3>Sorry.</v>

175
00:09:47.690 --> 00:09:48.523
<v Speaker 1>Now you might be wondering why is the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian tourism is so important to </v>

176
00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:51.980
<v Speaker 1>Svalbard?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

177
00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.320
<v Speaker 1>that's because it helps to retain </v>
<v Speaker 1>population,</v>

178
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:55.350
<v Speaker 1>but did it in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In,</v>

179
00:09:55.351 --> 00:09:56.390
<v Speaker 1>in Boris,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bu there are,</v>

180
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:58.330
<v Speaker 1>there are,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there are more on the,</v>

181
00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.323
<v Speaker 1>like a system very heavy there where the</v>
<v Speaker 1>coal company is everything and you're </v>

182
00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.780
<v Speaker 1>eating in the content and it's not </v>
<v Speaker 1>necessarily to buy your food so face.</v>

183
00:10:06.781 --> 00:10:09.440
<v Speaker 1>So for a better understanding and the </v>
<v Speaker 1>Russian sentiments,</v>

184
00:10:09.441 --> 00:10:11.640
<v Speaker 1>there is no currency.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The mining company,</v>

185
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:12.474
<v Speaker 1>it takes care of everything,</v>
<v Speaker 1>something like this didn't used to </v>

186
00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.373
<v Speaker 1>happen in the Norwegian settlements to </v>
<v Speaker 1>but then tourism staunton that brought </v>

187
00:10:18.410 --> 00:10:21.170
<v Speaker 1>all new kinds of businesses and as many </v>
<v Speaker 1>different people.</v>

188
00:10:21.171 --> 00:10:23.130
<v Speaker 1>So they are in the beginning of a </v>
<v Speaker 1>process,</v>

189
00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:26.020
<v Speaker 1>on the same way as we have been doing it</v>
<v Speaker 1>in longer beyond the last,</v>

190
00:10:26.021 --> 00:10:27.020
<v Speaker 1>uh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>25,</v>

191
00:10:27.050 --> 00:10:27.883
<v Speaker 1>30 years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But do you watch out because here we're </v>

192
00:10:29.271 --> 00:10:31.660
<v Speaker 1>talking about oil and influence in </v>
<v Speaker 1>what's my,</v>

193
00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:34.880
<v Speaker 1>it's become one of the main ocean </v>
<v Speaker 1>shipping routes in the world.</v>

194
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:35.893
<v Speaker 1>In fact,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even China is trying to buy property </v>

195
00:10:37.371 --> 00:10:38.204
<v Speaker 1>yet,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but that's a whole different issue and </v>

196
00:10:39.141 --> 00:10:41.260
<v Speaker 1>that's something we're going to talk </v>
<v Speaker 1>about in a future video.</v>
