1
00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.293
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh is the only country with an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic majority whose president is a </v>

2
00:00:11.181 --> 00:00:13.550
<v Speaker 1>woman.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Her name is Shankar on ads.</v>

3
00:00:13.551 --> 00:00:14.384
<v Speaker 1>This is not a literal example.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We're talking about the third biggest </v>

4
00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:20.330
<v Speaker 1>Muslim country with more than 160 </v>
<v Speaker 1>million inhabitants.</v>

5
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:22.200
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>
<v Speaker 1>there is one Bangladeshi,</v>

6
00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.030
<v Speaker 1>even more famous than shake Asina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is Mohammed,</v>

7
00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.883
<v Speaker 1>you know,</v>
<v Speaker 1>sees the Nobel Peace Prize winner as </v>

8
00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:30.050
<v Speaker 1>well as the inventor of micro credits is</v>
<v Speaker 1>also from Bangalore</v>

9
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.883
<v Speaker 2>Dash.</v>

10
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.870
<v Speaker 1>This is surprising given that in this </v>
<v Speaker 1>country,</v>

11
00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.800
<v Speaker 1>only at one out of every three citizens </v>
<v Speaker 1>has a bank accounts.</v>

12
00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:42.663
<v Speaker 1>It's like Bangladesh is one of the </v>
<v Speaker 1>fastest growing economies of the last </v>

13
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.513
<v Speaker 1>few years.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They have reduced poverty faster than </v>

14
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.883
<v Speaker 1>anyone else and they are also the </v>
<v Speaker 1>world's second largest textile </v>

15
00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:54.020
<v Speaker 1>manufacturer,</v>
<v Speaker 1>only surpassed by China.</v>

16
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:55.033
<v Speaker 1>But despite all of that,</v>
<v Speaker 1>most of the Bangladeshi people still </v>

17
00:00:57.561 --> 00:00:59.930
<v Speaker 1>keep them money at home.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So now you might be wondering,</v>

18
00:00:59.931 --> 00:01:00.800
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>why is this,</v>

19
00:01:00.801 --> 00:01:01.634
<v Speaker 1>what exactly is going on in Bangladesh </v>
<v Speaker 1>that causes people not to trust the </v>

20
00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:05.384
<v Speaker 1>bank?</v>

21
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.310
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the answer to this,</v>

22
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.630
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it's religion.</v>

23
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.020
<v Speaker 1>According to Islam.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Lending money with interest is a sin and</v>

24
00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.630
<v Speaker 1>90 percent of the Bangladeshi people are</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim,</v>

25
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.493
<v Speaker 1>but wait just a minute here because </v>
<v Speaker 1>things are changing in the last few </v>

26
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.873
<v Speaker 1>decades,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muslim countries have created a system </v>

27
00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.673
<v Speaker 1>that allows saving and lending money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>which also meets that Islamic </v>

28
00:01:28.501 --> 00:01:29.700
<v Speaker 1>principles.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Yes,</v>

29
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.563
<v Speaker 1>dear viewer.</v>
<v Speaker 1>We are talking of course about Islamic </v>

30
00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:33.624
<v Speaker 1>banking,</v>
<v Speaker 1>a phenomenon that is becoming more and </v>

31
00:01:35.101 --> 00:01:35.934
<v Speaker 1>more important in Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>and you might think that this is great </v>

32
00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:40.530
<v Speaker 1>news for the governments of shakers </v>
<v Speaker 1>scene of rice.</v>

33
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.490
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>in fact,</v>

34
00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:42.900
<v Speaker 1>the opposite is actually true.</v>

35
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.800
<v Speaker 1>Islami back Bangladesh is most watched </v>
<v Speaker 1>bankers,</v>

36
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.693
<v Speaker 1>so now the question becomes why does the</v>
<v Speaker 1>government of Bangladesh distrust </v>

37
00:01:52.821 --> 00:01:54.770
<v Speaker 1>Islamic banking?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And it's more importantly,</v>

38
00:01:54.771 --> 00:01:57.710
<v Speaker 1>what role might Islamic banking having </v>
<v Speaker 1>the future of Bangladesh?</v>

39
00:01:57.711 --> 00:01:58.544
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>today we're going to answer those </v>

40
00:01:59.031 --> 00:02:00.590
<v Speaker 1>questions,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but before we do,</v>

41
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.740
<v Speaker 1>let's answer the most important question</v>
<v Speaker 1>of all Islamic banking all about.</v>

42
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.133
<v Speaker 1>Okay,</v>
<v Speaker 1>so imagine we have a thousand American </v>

43
00:02:10.821 --> 00:02:11.654
<v Speaker 1>dollars and they're just sitting in a </v>
<v Speaker 1>savings accounts are western bank can </v>

44
00:02:13.791 --> 00:02:16.550
<v Speaker 1>give you an interest rate of say,</v>
<v Speaker 1>three percent.</v>

45
00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.530
<v Speaker 1>Now unsure.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Many of you have wondered,</v>

46
00:02:18.531 --> 00:02:19.364
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>
<v Speaker 1>how is it possible that a bank just </v>

47
00:02:20.091 --> 00:02:22.520
<v Speaker 1>gives us money for money that is simply </v>
<v Speaker 1>sitting in it,</v>

48
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.050
<v Speaker 1>but where's the profit here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

49
00:02:24.051 --> 00:02:25.520
<v Speaker 1>the truth is that that a thousand </v>
<v Speaker 1>dollars,</v>

50
00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:26.383
<v Speaker 1>it's not just staying in the bank safe.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Instead they use that money to lend to </v>

51
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.700
<v Speaker 1>companies and individuals.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Those lanes,</v>

52
00:02:31.701 --> 00:02:32.534
<v Speaker 1>they simply have a higher interest rate </v>
<v Speaker 1>so the bank makes money and gives us </v>

53
00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.373
<v Speaker 1>little sheriff that profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is the basic mechanism of the </v>

54
00:02:39.291 --> 00:02:40.470
<v Speaker 1>entire system of western</v>

55
00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:41.413
<v Speaker 2>banking.</v>

56
00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:45.543
<v Speaker 1>Now obviously this carries some degree </v>
<v Speaker 1>of risk because the bank can lose the </v>

57
00:02:48.491 --> 00:02:50.230
<v Speaker 1>money,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but depending on the country we live in,</v>

58
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.940
<v Speaker 1>the is forced by law to keep a small </v>
<v Speaker 1>percentage of that $1,000,</v>

59
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.730
<v Speaker 1>that percentage,</v>
<v Speaker 1>it cannot be humans and it's schools.</v>

60
00:02:57.731 --> 00:02:59.500
<v Speaker 1>The cash ratio.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Now,</v>

61
00:02:59.501 --> 00:03:00.334
<v Speaker 1>according to Sharia law,</v>
<v Speaker 1>this system is sinful because lending </v>

62
00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:05.620
<v Speaker 1>money with interest is seen as unfair.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Of course,</v>

63
00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.570
<v Speaker 1>there is no problem with keeping your </v>
<v Speaker 1>client's money,</v>

64
00:03:07.571 --> 00:03:10.830
<v Speaker 1>but you simply can't lend it to anyone </v>
<v Speaker 1>in economic jargon.</v>

65
00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.100
<v Speaker 1>This means that Sharia law demands a 100</v>
<v Speaker 1>percent cash ratio.</v>

66
00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:23.890
<v Speaker 1>So this in summary,</v>
<v Speaker 1>is the way that Islamic banks work,</v>

67
00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.330
<v Speaker 1>and I love you wondering,</v>
<v Speaker 1>well,</v>

68
00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.460
<v Speaker 1>why don't exactly is the business here?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

69
00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:30.970
<v Speaker 1>mainly Islamic banks will make money by </v>
<v Speaker 1>two means.</v>

70
00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.923
<v Speaker 1>First,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the banks charge their clients </v>

71
00:03:32.861 --> 00:03:33.694
<v Speaker 1>commissions for keeping the money.</v>
<v Speaker 1>So instead of giving you an interest </v>

72
00:03:36.221 --> 00:03:38.950
<v Speaker 1>rate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic banks can only give you a little</v>

73
00:03:38.951 --> 00:03:40.990
<v Speaker 1>symbolic presence.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This president,</v>

74
00:03:40.991 --> 00:03:41.824
<v Speaker 1>it's called the hip Bob.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Another business practice that is </v>

75
00:03:43.391 --> 00:03:46.150
<v Speaker 1>allowed by Sharia law is adding over </v>
<v Speaker 1>costs.</v>

76
00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:48.790
<v Speaker 1>For example,</v>
<v Speaker 1>let's say we buy a house with an Islamic</v>

77
00:03:48.791 --> 00:03:49.810
<v Speaker 1>bank.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In this case,</v>

78
00:03:49.811 --> 00:03:54.100
<v Speaker 1>the bank will buy the house for us and </v>
<v Speaker 1>then sell it to us at a higher price.</v>

79
00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:56.010
<v Speaker 1>And this price is called the mercer </v>
<v Speaker 1>rocket runs.</v>

80
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:56.853
<v Speaker 1>We can pay for it in installments.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If for whatever reason we can't compete </v>

81
00:04:00.221 --> 00:04:01.054
<v Speaker 1>the payments,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the bank will sell the house on the </v>

82
00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:03.094
<v Speaker 1>market.</v>
<v Speaker 1>If they do get some profit from the </v>

83
00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:05.383
<v Speaker 1>selling weed,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the clients can take a share of the </v>

84
00:04:06.881 --> 00:04:09.370
<v Speaker 1>profits.</v>
<v Speaker 1>But wait just a minute here because this</v>

85
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.860
<v Speaker 1>is not the end of the story.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The current bands,</v>

86
00:04:11.861 --> 00:04:12.694
<v Speaker 1>banks from investing in what they </v>
<v Speaker 1>considered dirty businesses such as </v>

87
00:04:15.431 --> 00:04:20.431
<v Speaker 1>tobacco weapons or productive.</v>
<v Speaker 1>There's even a special index.</v>

88
00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:27.290
<v Speaker 1>The Dow Jones Islamic markets has 1400 </v>
<v Speaker 1>companies from the New York stock market</v>

89
00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.020
<v Speaker 1>where Islamic banks can invest.</v>
<v Speaker 1>As you can imagine,</v>

90
00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:34.010
<v Speaker 1>these things are becoming really </v>
<v Speaker 1>successful in several Muslim countries,</v>

91
00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.460
<v Speaker 1>but well in Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>they are absolutely kicking off.</v>

92
00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:41.783
<v Speaker 1>Islamic banking is growing rapidly in </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh with a market share of about </v>

93
00:04:44.581 --> 00:04:46.500
<v Speaker 1>20 percent.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do they vent already?</v>

94
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.730
<v Speaker 1>AIDS banks have this kind of Bangladesh,</v>
<v Speaker 1>even Western banks like Citi on starting</v>

95
00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.564
<v Speaker 1>to offer banking services for those who </v>
<v Speaker 1>demand them in a country where brides </v>

96
00:04:55.091 --> 00:04:55.924
<v Speaker 1>are a thing everywhere Islamic banks are</v>
<v Speaker 1>famous for their transparency and good </v>

97
00:04:59.431 --> 00:05:01.530
<v Speaker 1>practices.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic banks for instance,</v>

98
00:05:01.531 --> 00:05:04.290
<v Speaker 1>a famous of having nothing to do with </v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bangladeshi government,</v>

99
00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:14.740
<v Speaker 1>so if you want to get a loan from an </v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic Bank,</v>

100
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:15.574
<v Speaker 1>you have to demonstrate the you are a </v>
<v Speaker 1>reliable clients willing to pay back </v>

101
00:05:18.851 --> 00:05:19.684
<v Speaker 1>your debts,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but hold on a minute here because well </v>

102
00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:25.600
<v Speaker 1>things they are not as good as they </v>
<v Speaker 1>might seem for these banks.</v>

103
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:31.480
<v Speaker 1>Good Bank,</v>
<v Speaker 1>bad bank,</v>

104
00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:32.493
<v Speaker 1>Islamic banking arrived in Bangladesh in</v>
<v Speaker 1>1983 when some Saudi and Kuwaiti hedge </v>

105
00:05:36.081 --> 00:05:38.860
<v Speaker 1>funds decided to create the Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bank.</v>

106
00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:43.030
<v Speaker 1>This bank played a crucial role in </v>
<v Speaker 1>turning an agricultural country into the</v>

107
00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.040
<v Speaker 1>textile powerhouse that it is today.</v>

108
00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.850
<v Speaker 2>Yeah.</v>

109
00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:46.683
<v Speaker 1>Today clothes make up 80 percent of </v>
<v Speaker 1>Bangladeshi exports and Islamic Bank is </v>

110
00:05:50.171 --> 00:05:52.090
<v Speaker 1>the biggest bank in the country.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Nonetheless,</v>

111
00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:55.150
<v Speaker 1>the growth of Islamic banking in the </v>
<v Speaker 1>country is not clear enough.</v>

112
00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.560
<v Speaker 1>Talk about our central bank is not </v>
<v Speaker 1>giving new Islamic banking licenses.</v>

113
00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.760
<v Speaker 1>Even those western banks that once to </v>
<v Speaker 1>give Islamic banking services must wait.</v>

114
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:08.773
<v Speaker 1>They clean.</v>
<v Speaker 1>They need to create a brand new </v>

115
00:06:09.801 --> 00:06:12.260
<v Speaker 1>regulations on the matter of Islamic </v>
<v Speaker 1>banking.</v>

116
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:13.213
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the governments of shake and CIENA has </v>

117
00:06:14.391 --> 00:06:15.224
<v Speaker 1>send inspectors to the Islamic bank </v>
<v Speaker 1>officers and they are surveying all of </v>

118
00:06:18.051 --> 00:06:18.884
<v Speaker 1>their movements.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Government initiates a coo at </v>

119
00:06:27.391 --> 00:06:30.030
<v Speaker 1>Bangladesh.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has biggest bank board members receive a</v>

120
00:06:30.031 --> 00:06:31.470
<v Speaker 1>visit from military intelligence?</v>

121
00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:32.660
<v Speaker 2>Yes.</v>

122
00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:35.603
<v Speaker 1>So now you might wonder what is wrong </v>
<v Speaker 1>with the Islamic banks and the </v>

123
00:06:37.981 --> 00:06:38.880
<v Speaker 1>governments?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

124
00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.370
<v Speaker 1>shake a scene of claims that they are </v>
<v Speaker 1>financing terrorism.</v>

125
00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.353
<v Speaker 1>As we explained in another video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Islamic terrorism is becoming a real </v>

126
00:06:44.701 --> 00:06:45.534
<v Speaker 1>threat to the country and many people </v>
<v Speaker 1>think some of these banks might be </v>

127
00:06:48.001 --> 00:06:53.001
<v Speaker 1>financing terrorist groups.</v>
<v Speaker 1>However,</v>

128
00:06:57.870 --> 00:07:00.720
<v Speaker 1>there are several reasons to make us </v>
<v Speaker 1>believe that at the end of the day,</v>

129
00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.440
<v Speaker 1>this is nothing but a power struggle </v>
<v Speaker 1>shake us.</v>

130
00:07:03.441 --> 00:07:04.274
<v Speaker 1>He loves to take things under her </v>
<v Speaker 1>control and the fact that the biggest </v>

131
00:07:06.661 --> 00:07:07.494
<v Speaker 1>bank in the country sympathizes with the</v>
<v Speaker 1>proposals of the opposition party </v>

132
00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:11.243
<v Speaker 1>certainly does not help.</v>
<v Speaker 1>This is why on January 2017 has seen an </v>

133
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:15.483
<v Speaker 1>interview,</v>
<v Speaker 1>interviewed the Islamic Bank and change </v>

134
00:07:16.561 --> 00:07:21.561
<v Speaker 1>the board of managers by her own son.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Since then,</v>

135
00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:23.003
<v Speaker 1>loans have skyrocketed.</v>
<v Speaker 1>The Bangladesh Central Bank itself has </v>

136
00:07:25.681 --> 00:07:27.690
<v Speaker 1>warned that some of these loans are too </v>
<v Speaker 1>risky.</v>

137
00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:28.583
<v Speaker 1>Meanwhile,</v>
<v Speaker 1>both Saudi and Qac hedge funds that </v>

138
00:07:30.271 --> 00:07:33.900
<v Speaker 1>created the bank 35 years ago and now </v>
<v Speaker 1>taking back their money,</v>

139
00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.330
<v Speaker 1>they simply don't think it is safe </v>
<v Speaker 1>anymore,</v>

140
00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.540
<v Speaker 1>but wait just a minute because this is </v>
<v Speaker 1>not the first time that shake his senior</v>

141
00:07:39.541 --> 00:07:42.160
<v Speaker 1>is trying to control the financial </v>
<v Speaker 1>industry in her.</v>

142
00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.770
<v Speaker 1>You want the guy we mentioned at the </v>
<v Speaker 1>beginning,</v>

143
00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:50.910
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Yunus.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Well,</v>

144
00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.570
<v Speaker 1>he is in.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has Seen as cross as to in the year 2006</v>

145
00:07:54.571 --> 00:07:55.404
<v Speaker 1>after some terrorist attacks,</v>
<v Speaker 1>the Bangladeshi army organized acute </v>

146
00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:01.260
<v Speaker 1>Atar and created a technocratic </v>
<v Speaker 1>governments.</v>

147
00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:02.153
<v Speaker 1>Back then,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Yunus was a favorite </v>

148
00:08:03.541 --> 00:08:04.374
<v Speaker 1>candidates.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you lead that government in the end </v>

149
00:08:06.330 --> 00:08:07.230
<v Speaker 1>though?</v>
<v Speaker 1>That didn't happen,</v>

150
00:08:07.350 --> 00:08:11.760
<v Speaker 1>but Hasina learned a vital lesson.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Beware of the bankers.</v>

151
00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:14.190
<v Speaker 1>Sometimes they like to get involved in </v>
<v Speaker 1>politics.</v>

152
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:15.083
<v Speaker 1>This is why has seen his first priority </v>
<v Speaker 1>after taking position in 2008 was to </v>

153
00:08:18.541 --> 00:08:20.490
<v Speaker 1>take care of Eunice.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First of all,</v>

154
00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.190
<v Speaker 1>she forced him to resign as the chairman</v>
<v Speaker 1>of his own bag,</v>

155
00:08:23.191 --> 00:08:24.024
<v Speaker 1>the grommet.</v>

156
00:08:33.190 --> 00:08:33.560
<v Speaker 2>Of course,</v>

157
00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:35.840
<v Speaker 1>some of our claims were true and make no</v>
<v Speaker 1>mistake.</v>

158
00:08:35.841 --> 00:08:36.674
<v Speaker 1>Muhammad Yunus is not a perfect guy,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but we're going to talk about this in </v>

159
00:08:39.411 --> 00:08:40.244
<v Speaker 1>another video,</v>
<v Speaker 1>but as if making him resigned was not </v>

160
00:08:41.811 --> 00:08:42.644
<v Speaker 1>enough.</v>
<v Speaker 1>Has also started a campaign to diminish </v>

161
00:08:44.871 --> 00:08:46.880
<v Speaker 1>his image in Bangladeshi society.</v>

162
00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:50.340
<v Speaker 2>No Nobel</v>

163
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:51.173
<v Speaker 1>laureate,</v>
<v Speaker 1>Eunice Got Hillary Clinton to stop web </v>

164
00:08:53.581 --> 00:08:56.880
<v Speaker 1>funding for Padma says Hasina.</v>
<v Speaker 1>In other words,</v>

165
00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:57.763
<v Speaker 1>shake us.</v>
<v Speaker 1>He knows how to beat her political </v>

166
00:08:59.221 --> 00:09:00.990
<v Speaker 1>enemies.</v>
<v Speaker 1>First it was eunice,</v>

167
00:09:01.110 --> 00:09:02.430
<v Speaker 1>now it's the Islamic Bank.</v>

168
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.693
<v Speaker 1>So the question is now,</v>
<v Speaker 1>do you think there is an actual </v>

169
00:09:13.711 --> 00:09:16.540
<v Speaker 1>connection between Islamic banks and </v>
<v Speaker 1>terrorism for.</v>

170
00:09:16.541 --> 00:09:17.374
<v Speaker 1>Is this just an excuse made on by shake </v>
<v Speaker 1>Asina in order to keep the finance </v>

171
00:09:20.461 --> 00:09:21.294
<v Speaker 1>industry under control?</v>
<v Speaker 1>And shouldn't Bangladesh allow Islamic </v>

172
00:09:23.941 --> 00:09:24.774
<v Speaker 1>banks?</v>
<v Speaker 1>Do you operate in the country without </v>

<v Speaker 1>restrictions?</v>
