1
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,990
Imagine in a country with a population 
of Manhattan,

2
00:00:09,991 --> 00:00:14,940
but with huge reserves of oil and gas,
the country surrounded by the wealthiest

3
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,940
oil rich monarchies,
or am I talking about?

4
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:19,043
Well,
that would be Bahrain so tiny that we 

5
00:00:21,481 --> 00:00:26,481
almost can't see it on the map.
Yes,

6
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:28,240
yes,
I know what you're thinking.

7
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:30,610
Life must be wonderful hair,
right?

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,990
Money for everybody.
A prosperous economy and amazing growth.

9
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:36,700
Right?
Well,

10
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:39,550
the opposite is in fact,
true

11
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,260
brain downgraded to junk as political 
crackdown continues unabated.

12
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:51,120
Yeah,
you heard that right?

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,890
Bahrain debt is considered to be a junk 
bonds on the international market.

14
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,963
This means investors are so hesitant 
about their economy that they don't 

15
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,480
believe Bahrain.
We'll be able to give back those loans.

16
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:06,150
The truth is things in Bahrain,
they're getting really,

17
00:01:06,151 --> 00:01:06,984
really sour.
If you've followed visual politic for a 

18
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:10,650
long time,
you already know that within the Islamic

19
00:01:10,651 --> 00:01:15,651
world there are two big groups,
Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims and well,

20
00:01:16,350 --> 00:01:18,420
they really hate each other.
As you know,

21
00:01:18,421 --> 00:01:19,254
Saudi Arabia is something like the Sunni
Muslim Hollywood and the Islamic 

22
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,340
Republic of Iran is of the same,
but for the sheer Muslims,

23
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,470
this is why they've been in a state of 
cold war for decades,

24
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:34,980
but

25
00:01:34,980 --> 00:01:35,813
in the context of this Cold War,
Bahrain is actually in the funniest 

26
00:01:38,821 --> 00:01:40,710
position of all.
Basically in this country,

27
00:01:40,711 --> 00:01:42,890
the majority of the population is Shia 
Muslim.

28
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:46,290
At the Royal House that rules the 
country is Sunni Muslim.

29
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:47,213
This is why that monarchs stuff turns 
political oppression into something of 

30
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,470
an art form.
All right,

31
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:56,580
so so far nothing in this video has 
probably surprised you're that much.

32
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:57,443
But then again,
the title of this video is why Bahrain 

33
00:01:59,431 --> 00:02:02,400
rain could become the world's wealthiest
country or something like that.

34
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:03,720
Honestly,
at the time of recording,

35
00:02:03,721 --> 00:02:06,330
we haven't actually decided the title of
this video,

36
00:02:06,331 --> 00:02:08,940
but so why don't we say something like 
that?

37
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:09,983
Well,
because of this rate discovers largest 

38
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:19,320
oil field in countries since 1932.
Yes,

39
00:02:19,321 --> 00:02:21,660
dear viewer.
They already had dinosaur juice,

40
00:02:21,661 --> 00:02:22,494
but now they have even more.
Basically Bahrain could have more oil 

41
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,200
than Russia and with a fraction of 
Russia's population,

42
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,710
so basically this means that there are 
less people to split the money with,

43
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:35,723
but the question is,
is this enough to be the wealthiest 

44
00:02:38,731 --> 00:02:39,690
country on the planet?

45
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:40,553
Why even with sonar trial,
are Bahrain's data barns still 

46
00:02:44,341 --> 00:02:47,580
considered to be junk?
What the hell is going on in Bahrain?

47
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:48,473
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

48
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:51,900
those questions,
but as always,

49
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:57,230
let's take a look back at the history 
cage.

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:02,280
All right.
If any of you out there,

51
00:03:02,281 --> 00:03:05,770
once it become a dictator one day,
here are some pro tips.

52
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:08,380
Basically,
there are two ways to make people follow

53
00:03:08,381 --> 00:03:09,310
you.
The first one,

54
00:03:09,460 --> 00:03:10,293
good old oppression.
The problem with that though is that if 

55
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,560
you go too crazy with the oppression,
you're gonna risk.

56
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,320
A popular uprising and maybe ending up 
with Gaddafi.

57
00:03:17,550 --> 00:03:20,770
There was a band that involved.
It's not a good time.

58
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:24,010
Don't watch that video.
We've told you thousands of times,

59
00:03:24,011 --> 00:03:27,400
Aaron visual politics,
being a dictator is a risky job.

60
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:29,740
Not many of them go and die of old age.

61
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,140
Sure,

62
00:03:34,180 --> 00:03:35,013
but there is an alternative and it's 
healthier and it's more sustainable and 

63
00:03:37,481 --> 00:03:40,090
is what we're calling the money for 
nothing.

64
00:03:40,091 --> 00:03:40,924
Strategy.
Basically you shower all of your 

65
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,300
citizens in gold if that wealthy and 
they don't need to get a job,

66
00:03:46,301 --> 00:03:51,301
they don't worry about politics.
All right,

67
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:53,694
so the Al Khalifa family,
the ruling family in Bahrain has 

68
00:03:56,011 --> 00:03:59,070
combined both of these methods in a very
effective fashion.

69
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:01,050
In fact,
the prime minister who happens to be the

70
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:01,884
kings uncle,
holds the world record for the longest 

71
00:04:03,931 --> 00:04:07,020
lasting ruler.
He has been in power since 1971.

72
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:11,633
Nonetheless,
how can I Sunni Muslim families stay in 

73
00:04:13,771 --> 00:04:14,604
power for such a long time in the 
country with a sheer majority 

74
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:21,740
population?
Well,

75
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:22,603
let's be honest,
before we have the good old iron fist 

76
00:04:24,690 --> 00:04:26,610
protest against the government,
hey,

77
00:04:26,640 --> 00:04:27,473
great.
You'll automatically be considered a 

78
00:04:28,531 --> 00:04:29,364
terrorist.
You'll go to jail and you're probably 

79
00:04:31,081 --> 00:04:33,660
either be given the death penalty or 
exiles,

80
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,940
and we're not talking about an isolated 
example here.

81
00:04:35,941 --> 00:04:36,774
This is something that happens.
Every single rain strips 115 of 

82
00:04:46,081 --> 00:04:46,914
nationality over terrorism allocations.
Over 700 people in Bahrain have had 

83
00:04:51,961 --> 00:04:54,440
their citizenship revoked since 2010.

84
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:55,303
Well,

85
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:01,620
and yes,
I know what you're going to say.

86
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:02,520
Oh,
come on,

87
00:05:02,521 --> 00:05:03,354
Simon.
Don't be such a snowflake and other 

88
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:08,200
democratic countries that Retalia 
citizenship too,

89
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,900
and of course,
well,

90
00:05:10,290 --> 00:05:13,710
you're right,
but the difference is the proportions.

91
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,693
For example,
in the United Kingdom there are some 

92
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:16,950
examples,
sure,

93
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:21,030
but in fall rain we're talking about 
hundreds are so now you might say,

94
00:05:21,031 --> 00:05:22,890
well,
things are changing Simon.

95
00:05:22,891 --> 00:05:24,990
I mean the world is evolving.
The Middle East,

96
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:27,160
it's getting more modern.
Well,

97
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,680
I'm sorry to say,
but in this case,

98
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,090
that's not true at all.
In fact,

99
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,040
the opposite is true.
In 2011,

100
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:35,480
the Shia citizens took to the streets as
part of the Arabs,

101
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:36,720
right?

102
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,480
Rabia,
along with the United Arab Emirates sent

103
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:47,620
troops to help the Bahraini government 
to suppress these demonstrations.

104
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:48,873
Today,
one out of every 500 people in Bahrain 

105
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:54,360
are political prisoners among them,
many leaders,

106
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,353
but on any of that,
since 2011 Bahrain passed new laws to 

107
00:05:58,101 --> 00:06:00,410
make it easier to retire one 
citizenship.

108
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:01,483
And believe me,
losing Bahraini citizenship is a big 

109
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,293
shame.
Citizenship means that you lose all of 

110
00:06:10,421 --> 00:06:11,254
your rights.

111
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,550
Yes,

112
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:17,100
you'll have to give up your passport,
your driver's license.

113
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,140
You cannot own a house,
a car,

114
00:06:19,141 --> 00:06:21,060
a phone,
or a bank account.

115
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,970
You cannot marry in the country.
And if you decide to leave,

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,090
you cannot go back.
If you happen to stay well,

117
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,890
you can't leave.
In summary,

118
00:06:28,891 --> 00:06:32,250
opposing the government tends you into a
second class citizen and well,

119
00:06:32,251 --> 00:06:35,910
this is a big shame because being a 
first lawsuit as an embodied brain,

120
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:38,040
it's actually pretty great.
And this,

121
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:41,040
this is where that money for nothing 
policy comes into play.

122
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:44,250
This is what we call Bahrain's social 
contract.

123
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,320
Basically,
if you forget about politics,

124
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:49,050
you don't have to worry about anything 
looking for a job,

125
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,580
you can get one.
Even the governments,

126
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:51,623
don't worry,
nobody's going to check if you even go 

127
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:54,414
to the office,

128
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,820
need to pick up some things in the 
supermarket.

129
00:06:59,821 --> 00:07:00,654
Don't worry.
Everything is super cheap because it's 

130
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:04,290
all subsidized.
Need fuel for your car.

131
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:06,530
Well,
that's also crazy cheap.

132
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:08,130
All right,
so now you might be wondering,

133
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:09,330
well,
what happens if I don't want to work for

134
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,081
the government,
Simon?

135
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:12,900
I don't like it.
I want to work in a private business.

136
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:14,280
Well still,
no problem.

137
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:16,680
The government guarantees quotas for 
local workers,

138
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:19,170
so no immigrants is gonna take away your
job.

139
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:22,530
This is actually the funniest part of 
all the immigrant quote.

140
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:25,750
Basically they're there to reserve the 
coolest jobs for the local.

141
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:26,940
Yeah.

142
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:32,093
For example,
50 percent of bank workers have to be 

143
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,420
from Bahrain in the cool,
fancy shops.

144
00:07:36,421 --> 00:07:39,000
It's 30 percent,
but construction work as well.

145
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,500
That's just five.
Why?

146
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,020
Because he wants to lay bricks under the
hot bar,

147
00:07:43,021 --> 00:07:43,854
rainy son.
This is why it 55 percent of the 

148
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:47,253
Bahraini population are immigrants and 
they are the ones who actually get the 

149
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:52,770
countries work done and well,
to be fair,

150
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:54,510
I need to make an aside here.
Look,

151
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,720
having more immigrants than locals is 
very common in the Middle East.

152
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,583
For example,
foreign citizens make up 75 percent of 

153
00:08:00,331 --> 00:08:04,170
Qatar's population,
but Bahrain is a pioneer in another way.

154
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:08,490
They are one of the few countries that 
ban the socorro and so.

155
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:10,050
Well,
what is the godfather roller balance?

156
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,560
Well,
this is a sort of modern day slavery.

157
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:17,490
The Catholicism links foreign workers 
with a national who is that patron?

158
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:18,503
This patron can decide whether the 
immigrants can change his or her job or 

159
00:08:21,750 --> 00:08:23,730
even leave the country at all.
So well.

160
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,880
Bahrain has actually abolished this 
inhuman practice so.

161
00:08:26,881 --> 00:08:28,560
Well that's good.
Nonetheless,

162
00:08:28,561 --> 00:08:29,394
despite all of this,
what you might wonder as well kind of 

163
00:08:31,051 --> 00:08:35,490
country where nobody works actually 
prosper and the answer is,

164
00:08:35,970 --> 00:08:37,200
well of course not

165
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,750
$120 living without working is 
expensive.

166
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:53,550
They already manages in Bahrain because 
of one thing,

167
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,113
oil makes up more than 60 percent of 
their exports in 75 percent of the 

168
00:09:02,411 --> 00:09:05,250
government's income.
Plus in order to cover all of the costs,

169
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,130
the government needs the oil barrel 
price at $120 less than that.

170
00:09:09,310 --> 00:09:11,440
They didn't make enough profit to make 
ends meet.

171
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:13,000
And now you might be wondering,
well,

172
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:18,100
is $120 too much or too little?
Well look at it's historic.

173
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,310
That happens

174
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:26,650
in July of 2008 when oil was $147,
but as you know,

175
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:31,651
in 2014 oil prices fell in January 2016,
they went down a dozen little as $26.

176
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,400
And this explains news like

177
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:37,533
yes,

178
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:41,383
p cuts Bahrain rating b plus.
So what did they do with low prices and 

179
00:09:45,261 --> 00:09:46,094
lack of income.
Of course they took on more and more 

180
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:51,320
debt and the results it speaks for 
itself.

181
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:52,213
In just two years,
public debt has gone from seven percent 

182
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,380
to 70 percent and despite crude oil 
prices going up again,

183
00:09:57,381 --> 00:10:01,700
it seems pretty unlikely that it will 
reach $120 a barrel anytime soon.

184
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,810
So far Bahrain has already revoked 
subsidies on meat products and.

185
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:08,480
Well this is only the beginning.

186
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:17,670
We'll introduce VAT by end of 2018 says 
finance minister.

187
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,070
Yeah.
You had that right.

188
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:19,904
In Bahrain there is no income tax and so
far they didn't even have indirect 

189
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:23,954
taxation,
but the situation is desperate and they 

190
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:29,600
need to create a new taxes that simply 
didn't even exist before.

191
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:32,210
But what does this mean for Bar rain?
Well,

192
00:10:32,211 --> 00:10:34,850
do you remember how this particular 
authoritarian rule works?

193
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:35,713
Well,
they've sheer population except Sony 

194
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:39,140
oppression in exchange for money for 
nothing.

195
00:10:39,141 --> 00:10:44,141
So when the economics fail,
politics fails to now only a miracle can

196
00:10:44,151 --> 00:10:44,984
save the outcome for family and well,
that miracle is this one oil miracle so 

197
00:10:56,121 --> 00:10:58,820
far,
Bahrain produces 200,000 barrels a day.

198
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:02,660
This is nothing compared with the tens 
of millions in Saudi Arabia.

199
00:11:02,661 --> 00:11:05,930
But it's insane when we take into 
account in the country's size,

200
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:06,853
as I said before,
Bahrain has just discovered a big old 

201
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:10,693
oil that.
And they could start pumping dinosaur 

202
00:11:12,141 --> 00:11:17,141
juice in as little as five years 
according to optimistic analysts.

203
00:11:19,071 --> 00:11:21,860
This could double production and ends 
the deficit problem.

204
00:11:22,070 --> 00:11:22,903
Alright,
so this all sounds fantastic and 

205
00:11:23,601 --> 00:11:25,430
wonderful.
So what exactly is the problem?

206
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:26,323
Well,
if you watch visual politic often you 

207
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,453
probably have guessed and that's that 
not every type of oil costs the same to 

208
00:11:31,911 --> 00:11:32,744
extract.

209
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,210
And

210
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:40,810
this new oil that has all the 
ingredients needed to be very,

211
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:42,730
very expensive.
First of all,

212
00:11:42,731 --> 00:11:43,564
it's underwater.
That means that Bahrain has to build 

213
00:11:44,891 --> 00:11:47,740
platforms on the sea floor.
Second is shale oil,

214
00:11:47,741 --> 00:11:48,574
which means it's under a rock.
You need fracking technology to break 

215
00:11:51,581 --> 00:11:55,150
that rock and that fracking is really 
expensive.

216
00:11:58,520 --> 00:11:59,353
In this chart you can see the cost of 
production of a barrel of oil in 

217
00:12:02,361 --> 00:12:03,194
different countries.
We don't know how much fracking would 

218
00:12:05,691 --> 00:12:06,524
cost in Bahrain,
but we can look to see how much it 

219
00:12:08,481 --> 00:12:09,650
costs.
For example,

220
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,650
in the United States,
if you pay attention to the chart,

221
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,633
you can see that fracking,
shale oil is significantly more 

222
00:12:16,281 --> 00:12:20,210
expensive than extracting oil in more 
conventional methods.

223
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,870
If Bahrain wants to make a profit,
the barrels should cost over $60,

224
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:27,260
but since they need a huge profit to 
cover all of their expenses,

225
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:30,860
they need an even higher market price.
So wait a second.

226
00:12:30,861 --> 00:12:33,050
What?
What can save Bahrain from ruin?

227
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,153
Well,
the answer is the same as other Middle 

228
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,730
Eastern countries and that's 
diversification.

229
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,480
They need to produce other things that's
not just oil and this explains news.

230
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:43,133
Yes,

231
00:12:47,250 --> 00:12:48,083
La opens $90,
million dollar factory of the future in 

232
00:12:51,241 --> 00:12:52,074
Bahrain,
but of course if you really want to 

233
00:12:53,641 --> 00:12:57,900
attract business from other industries,
you need something other than oil beds.

234
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:58,763
You need rule of law,
you need clear taxes and you need a 

235
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:03,270
government that doesn't send people to 
jail without a trial.

236
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:04,133
We've told you several times on this 
channel do buying and generally 

237
00:13:06,481 --> 00:13:07,314
speaking,
the United Arab Emirates started down 

238
00:13:08,731 --> 00:13:11,190
this path of years ago.
Now Saudi Arabia,

239
00:13:11,191 --> 00:13:12,024
it's probably going to follow suit,
although we're not really sure about 

240
00:13:14,071 --> 00:13:14,970
that.
And look,

241
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:18,390
it's only a matter of time before 
Bahrain's dance doing the same,

242
00:13:18,690 --> 00:13:19,523
but of course,
if those economic reforms mean that the 

243
00:13:21,061 --> 00:13:23,550
Bahraini people have to pay taxes or 
even,

244
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,533
you know,
work hard than the ruling family is 

245
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,560
going to be in.
Right?

246
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,433
So the big question now becomes,
do you think the Bahraini citizens are 

247
00:13:36,171 --> 00:13:38,720
going to accept such an authoritarian 
governments?

248
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:41,870
If they no longer enjoying the money for
nothing policy,

249
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:42,823
do you think they're going to find a way
to reform the system while please leave
