1
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:13,060
We know immigration is a hot topic in 
the United States,

2
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:16,110
and of course it's a polarizing subject.
You might be in favor of it,

3
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:18,930
we might be against it,
but you're unlikely to be neutral.

4
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:19,793
You're probably also think that 
immigration is either an opportunity or 

5
00:00:22,261 --> 00:00:23,094
it's a threat,

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,123
and Jane Migration Ending Chain 
Migration and canceling the visa 

7
00:00:29,621 --> 00:00:30,454
lottery.
President trump has railed against the 

8
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:35,530
immigration family reunification program
since 2016,

9
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:38,590
making it a centerpiece of his campaign 
for president,

10
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:39,543
but now that the first lady's parents,
his in laws have used the program to 

11
00:00:42,530 --> 00:00:43,363
have to become US citizens.
Critics are the ones having the field 

12
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:49,390
day.
Shane migration is one of the disasters.

13
00:00:49,391 --> 00:00:52,700
Chain migration is a disaster.
Disaster.

14
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:57,100
A total disaster chain migration,
however,

15
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,360
was in the United States.
There's another kind of immigration that

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:04,140
isn't talked about very much,
but which involves a huge flow of people

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,900
moving from one territory to another.
Every single.

18
00:01:06,901 --> 00:01:07,734
Yeah,
I'm talking about interstate 

19
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:09,983
immigration,
the kind of immigration that happens 

20
00:01:11,371 --> 00:01:14,250
between the states that make up the 
entire country.

21
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:16,940
This is something that creates winners 
and losers.

22
00:01:16,941 --> 00:01:17,210
Steak,

23
00:01:17,210 --> 00:01:19,690
sweet have losers.
We have losers.

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:20,603
Also,
folks after Donald Trump and the 

25
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:22,164
republican party's latest fiscal reform 
and everything indicates that this type 

26
00:01:24,901 --> 00:01:27,150
of immigration is going to grow.
Obviously,

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:28,043
as you can imagine,
people tend to immigrate to the most 

28
00:01:29,851 --> 00:01:30,684
prosperous territories.
So here are a few questions that you 

29
00:01:33,211 --> 00:01:34,044
might now be asking yourselves.
What interstate immigration trends are 

30
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:37,463
happening in the United States?
What does this type of integration 

31
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,313
entail?
Which states are the winners and which 

32
00:01:41,731 --> 00:01:43,950
are the losers?
Why and well,

33
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:45,640
what can we expect in the future?
Well,

34
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:46,950
let someone look at all of that.
Shall We?

35
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:57,650
Winners and losers.
Yeah.

36
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:00,830
Millions of Americans pack up their bags
and move to another state.

37
00:02:04,390 --> 00:02:07,350
Some states have positive immigration 
balances every year.

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,480
That is to say year after year more 
compatriots arrive,

39
00:02:10,580 --> 00:02:13,020
then leave,
and also of course the opposite happens.

40
00:02:13,050 --> 00:02:16,110
Some states see many residents move to 
another state every year,

41
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:20,310
many more than the number who arrive.
This is because states compete with each

42
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:22,680
other.
Of course,

43
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:25,830
each state has its own characteristics.
It's own regulations,

44
00:02:25,831 --> 00:02:27,270
its own taxes,
policies,

45
00:02:27,271 --> 00:02:28,104
and logically.
This makes some states much more 

46
00:02:29,551 --> 00:02:30,384
prosperous than others.
Obviously people tend to move to more 

47
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,520
prosperous places to states where 
there's more work,

48
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
there's better living conditions and 
where more companies are being 

49
00:02:38,611 --> 00:02:39,444
established.
Well according to data from the irs or 

50
00:02:41,551 --> 00:02:42,384
internal revenue service,
the federal government agency 

51
00:02:44,221 --> 00:02:49,221
responsible for collecting taxes between
the end of 2015 and the start of 2016 to

52
00:02:49,361 --> 00:02:52,230
two point eight percent of taxpayers and
moved to another state.

53
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,153
According to this information now,
and I assure you that the irs has the 

54
00:02:55,351 --> 00:02:58,110
best data in the United States,
the migration rates,

55
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:58,944
the internal mobility in the United 
States is very and I mean very high 

56
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,590
compared to other developed countries.
Having said this,

57
00:03:10,221 --> 00:03:13,280
do you want to know which states that 
the greatest migration read deficit that

58
00:03:13,281 --> 00:03:16,910
is the states with the greatest 
difference between Americans leaving and

59
00:03:16,911 --> 00:03:17,870
arriving pay?
Yeah.

60
00:03:17,990 --> 00:03:18,920
Well,
check this out.

61
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,640
Yes.
As you can see,

62
00:03:27,641 --> 00:03:28,474
New York is in the lead as the least 
attractive state for Americans to stay 

63
00:03:32,021 --> 00:03:32,854
in in net terms only in 2016 and 
discounting arrivals more than 150,000 

64
00:03:37,391 --> 00:03:37,880
Americans

65
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,713
left.

66
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,410
It's followed by other states such as 
Illinois,

67
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,330
New Jersey,
and California,

68
00:03:45,390 --> 00:03:47,700
and really could anyone imagine the 
California,

69
00:03:47,701 --> 00:03:48,534
the land of technology,
gorgeous beaches in good weather would 

70
00:03:50,701 --> 00:03:51,870
be on this list.
Well,

71
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:54,240
there it is.
And now the opposite question.

72
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,290
What are the states with the greatest 
migratory surplus of Americans?

73
00:03:58,291 --> 00:03:59,124
Well,
check this out.

74
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:11,170
Florida with a positive balance of about
200,000 Americans has become the big

75
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,043
winner.

76
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,010
Mind you,
this information is from 2016,

77
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:20,620
but if instead of taking the data from 
the last available,

78
00:04:20,621 --> 00:04:22,660
yeah,
we looked at a longer period of time.

79
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:24,840
For example,
since the beginning of the 19 nineties,

80
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,100
the result is practically the same.
New York,

81
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,790
California,
and Illinois last,

82
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,000
the most Americans while Florida,
Arizona,

83
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,590
and Texas one the most.

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,273
And hold on a second here because this 
is really much more important than you 

85
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:40,564
might be thinking during the video we 
made recently about the hidden debts of 

86
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:45,040
the different states in America.
Well folks,

87
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:48,880
every time estate loses Americans,
it loses a bit of wealth.

88
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:51,190
For example,
the almost 200,000 Americans,

89
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,024
he moved to Florida in net terms in 2016
as an income of more than 

90
00:04:55,001 --> 00:04:55,834
$17,000,000,000 a year.
This is an income that from now on will 

91
00:04:59,411 --> 00:05:00,244
be produced within Florida positive.
This will be saved in the state's 

92
00:05:02,981 --> 00:05:03,814
financial entities while another part 
will be spent in its stores and 

93
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:07,270
supermarkets,
cinemas,

94
00:05:07,271 --> 00:05:08,104
restaurants and gas stations,
and another part that will be invested 

95
00:05:10,721 --> 00:05:13,870
in new businesses that will be mainly 
located within Florida.

96
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,580
All of this means more wealth,
more work,

97
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,473
and what tax revenues for the state.
So at this point you might be beginning 

98
00:05:23,851 --> 00:05:26,700
to see why this is quite so important.
However,

99
00:05:26,701 --> 00:05:28,870
having seen all this,
the question does remain well,

100
00:05:28,871 --> 00:05:31,830
what variables?
They explained this movement of people.

101
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,783
Well listen up competition.
There are many reasons why people move 

102
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:47,540
from one place to another.
This family work,

103
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,410
climate opportunities,
universities,

104
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:50,860
plenty of things.
However,

105
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,990
if we take all of the data into our 
accounts,

106
00:05:52,991 --> 00:05:55,540
there are a couple of factors that 
really stand out.

107
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:56,650
One of them is taxes

108
00:05:58,630 --> 00:05:59,463
in 2016,
almost 600,000 people moved from the 25 

109
00:06:02,381 --> 00:06:06,490
states with the highest access to the 25
states with the lowest taxes.

110
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:08,860
In fact,
the 25 states with the highest taxes,

111
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:13,861
no less than 24 has a net immigration.
That is they so more Americans leaving.

112
00:06:14,141 --> 00:06:19,090
Then arriving,
displaying while sometimes said internal

113
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:22,810
migration isn't motivated by the weather
or things like that.

114
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,110
Well,
California does suffer from this deficit

115
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,370
to state like New Hampshire,
which is small,

116
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,480
cold,
mountainous,

117
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:29,314
and has a narrow coastline.
They've recorded a surplus since the 

118
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,690
year 2000 and listen up because Rhode 
Island for Mon said,

119
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,553
Massachusetts all have much higher taxes
and they lose Americans every year and 

120
00:06:39,941 --> 00:06:41,560
yes,
New Hampshire is the state.

121
00:06:41,561 --> 00:06:44,140
We're the second lowest taxes in the 
United States.

122
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,790
Coincidence,
oh no.

123
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:51,190
Runs in the Midwest.
While South Dakota generally registers a

124
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:54,010
surplus of immigrants from year to year.
It's neighboring states,

125
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:55,120
Nebraska,
Iowa,

126
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,920
and Minnesota,
which has higher taxes,

127
00:06:56,921 --> 00:07:00,520
have had migration deficits for five 
consecutive years,

128
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:03,970
and then this Kentucky versus Tennessee 
or California versus Nevada,

129
00:07:03,971 --> 00:07:04,804
Texas versus Washington states with 
higher taxes lose and states with lower 

130
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:09,780
taxes.

131
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:10,613
When

132
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:12,873
Morris study done by economists from the
Treasury Department estimated that when 

133
00:07:15,371 --> 00:07:19,450
New Jersey raised at state income tax in
2004 by almost two point five points,

134
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:23,200
it caused more than $80 million as to 
change residences every year.

135
00:07:23,290 --> 00:07:24,123
That might not seem like much,
but the truth is that residents with 

136
00:07:26,231 --> 00:07:28,900
higher rates,
they pay proportionately more taxes.

137
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:31,150
Now,
hold on a second because with taxes come

138
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:34,900
regulations for example,
and perhaps especially those that affect

139
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:37,600
housing,
see a combination of high property taxes

140
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,740
and several regulations and limitations 
make living in one particular state,

141
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,780
much more expensive than living in 
another.

142
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:44,673
This is what happens in California.
California is fed up with housing costs 

143
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:52,780
and taxes are fleeing state in big 
numbers.

144
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,440
Folks renting an apartment in Las Vegas 
or phoenix costs on average,

145
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,303
less than half of the cost of an 
apartment in Los Angeles or San 

146
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,770
Francisco.
Not much housing and a lot of demand led

147
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:07,771
to incredibly high price and of course 
this makes moving to another state worth

148
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:13,310
it for many people,
even if they learn less.

149
00:08:13,370 --> 00:08:16,970
So this has been the case so far and we 
can see that the effect that all of this

150
00:08:16,971 --> 00:08:20,180
has is very important.
States with a migration,

151
00:08:20,181 --> 00:08:21,014
sepsis,
this have also been able to grow more 

152
00:08:22,221 --> 00:08:25,130
public because they have more attractive
policies for companies,

153
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:29,000
entrepreneurs and we've also seen yes,
but from now on,

154
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:31,580
everything indicates that the effects 
will be even greater.

155
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,360
This is all thanks to Donald Trump and 
the republican party's tax reform.

156
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,283
Listen up

157
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,530
more competition.

158
00:08:45,030 --> 00:08:45,210
This

159
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:47,670
may be one of the best things that 
Donald trump has done,

160
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:50,690
the fiscal reform at the end of 2017.
Not only humans,

161
00:08:50,700 --> 00:08:51,533
improving taxation for companies,
but also boosting competition among the 

162
00:08:54,331 --> 00:08:55,410
states.
Until now,

163
00:08:55,411 --> 00:08:58,380
the federal government subsidized parts 
of estates taxes.

164
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,243
This is because they weren't deductible,
but what you paid to the state was 

165
00:09:01,831 --> 00:09:04,770
deducted from the taxes that you have to
pay to the federal government.

166
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,340
This is something that worked as an 
incentive for states to raise taxes.

167
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:13,743
Tax Reform has limited the situation so 
that the number of households that can 

168
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,010
deduct so local and state taxes has 
dropped from 42 million homes in 2017 to

169
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:21,844
about $70,
million in 2018 all while having a 

170
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:25,023
smaller deduction amounts.
This has been the equivalent of an 

171
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,534
automatic tax increase in the states 
with higher taxes because now that 

172
00:09:31,091 --> 00:09:35,170
taxpayers will have to pay the state tax
and practically the entire federal tax.

173
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:39,563
For example,
according to the calculations of the 

174
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,950
Cato Foundation,
a tax plan from the state of New York in

175
00:09:43,951 --> 00:09:44,784
2017 would have received a rate of 33 
percent on federal income tax and 

176
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:49,463
$30,000 on state and local taxes.
It could have decreased federal taxes 

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,830
like $10,000.
That is thanks to his deduction at state

178
00:09:55,831 --> 00:09:59,220
and local taxes would have cost $20,000.
However,

179
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:00,054
with the new tax reform though now I 
have to pay $30,000 for state and local 

180
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,400
taxes,
which is 33 percent more.

181
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:06,650
And people really feel that asking,

182
00:10:09,110 --> 00:10:09,943
so now the differences between the 
states with the highest taxes in the 

183
00:10:12,171 --> 00:10:13,004
states with the lowest taxes is going to
be much greater perhaps at the high tax 

184
00:10:17,031 --> 00:10:17,864
states,
didn't have this federal crutch to prop 

185
00:10:19,611 --> 00:10:20,444
up their big spending.
They might have to cut taxes to stay 

186
00:10:22,491 --> 00:10:25,550
competitive.
Ronald Reagan as the Wall Street Journal

187
00:10:25,551 --> 00:10:26,384
recently published as a boom in Florida 
for wealthy boss who wants to purchase 

188
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:31,850
real estate and to establish their 
residents there.

189
00:10:31,910 --> 00:10:33,020
And you know why?
Well,

190
00:10:33,021 --> 00:10:33,854
it probably has something to do with the
fact that Florida doesn't have a state 

191
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:39,890
income tax and that it's property taxes 
are also relatively low.

192
00:10:42,710 --> 00:10:44,270
Anyway,
she knew what this all means.

193
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,133
Well,
it means no less than a new era of 

194
00:10:47,091 --> 00:10:50,600
competition between the states of the 
USA has begun from now on.

195
00:10:50,601 --> 00:10:54,440
State governments will feel a lot more 
pressure to manage their budgets well.

196
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,560
The good news is that the evidence 
points to this being good for everyone.

197
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,603
Basically,
a growing rivalry between states is 

198
00:10:59,991 --> 00:11:00,824
beginning to develop behind the scenes a
rivalry to be the most desirable and 

199
00:11:03,741 --> 00:11:06,200
affordable place for US citizens to 
live.
