1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,550
On this channel,
we talk about politics.

2
00:00:02,650 --> 00:00:03,483
Are you prepared to accept the truth?
Because that's what I'm going to tell 

3
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:08,820
these people are out to make your lives 
a living hell.

4
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:10,330
You are fake news,
okay?

5
00:00:10,331 --> 00:00:12,090
Okay,
but not this kind of politics.

6
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:12,924
In this channel,
we want to know the why of politics and 

7
00:00:14,941 --> 00:00:18,090
the why of economics.
When the whole world needs your oil,

8
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,240
you have all of the deal making power.
We want to understand why some countries

9
00:00:24,781 --> 00:00:25,614
are poor.
How did the government destroy the 

10
00:00:27,241 --> 00:00:28,074
economy in such a short amount of time 
and how good politics can make good 

11
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:32,993
countries.
Switzerland has one of the world's best 

12
00:00:34,801 --> 00:00:35,634
political systems and we believe that 
this is the reason that they are 

13
00:00:38,551 --> 00:00:42,000
successful and to understand how the 
world is changing.

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,223
In other words,
Estonia has invented a brands new 

15
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:48,390
concepts,
the concept of liquid citizenship.

16
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:51,240
In fact,
this has nothing to do with the politics

17
00:00:51,241 --> 00:00:53,880
that you see in the traditional media.
It's real.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,160
It's informative,
it's visual or politic,

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:57,570
and welcome to our channel.
