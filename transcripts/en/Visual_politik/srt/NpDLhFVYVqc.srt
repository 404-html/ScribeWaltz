1
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,090
Let us start two days video with having 
a look at a question.

2
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,953
If you could choose between living like 
the richest and most powerful person in 

3
00:00:15,571 --> 00:00:18,250
the world,
save three or 400 years ago and say,

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,093
ah,
like George Washington or living today 

5
00:00:20,971 --> 00:00:24,600
as a normal middle class person from a 
country like New Zealand,

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,770
Denmark,
or Canada,

7
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:27,870
well,
which one would you choose?

8
00:00:32,690 --> 00:00:33,523
Well,
many of you watching right now might be 

9
00:00:34,101 --> 00:00:36,830
tempted to choose all of that power and 
influence.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,640
Right?
Well,

11
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:40,640
if you chose that option,
my dear friends,

12
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,460
I don't think you have thought it 
through quite enough.

13
00:00:43,490 --> 00:00:44,630
Okay.
Allow me to explain.

14
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:45,493
Choosing one of those historical super 
fourteens would involve giving up basic 

15
00:00:48,411 --> 00:00:49,880
things like AC,
internet,

16
00:00:49,881 --> 00:00:50,810
mobile phones,
movies,

17
00:00:50,811 --> 00:00:51,770
pizza hands.
Well,

18
00:00:51,771 --> 00:00:55,520
a whole other number of things that are 
indispensable in our lives today.

19
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:56,773
Like pizza.

20
00:00:59,910 --> 00:01:00,743
No,

21
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,280
no,
as of course,

22
00:01:02,281 --> 00:01:04,110
then there's the fact that you'd have to
deal with a much,

23
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,690
much shorter life expectancy.
For example,

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,570
let's take a look at the description 
that economists,

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,210
Xavier Salah,
El Martin made of Mansa Musa,

26
00:01:12,211 --> 00:01:13,044
the first of Molly's life,
who at current prices would be 

27
00:01:15,061 --> 00:01:18,510
considered the richest person of all 
time.

28
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:22,680
It took several months for a Mansa Musa 
to travel the 5,000

29
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,340
kilometers that separate molly from 
Mecca on horseback,

30
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,060
a trip that my modern plane,
I take about six and a half hours.

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:34,860
His palaces had no air conditioning,
no access to Google and his children can

32
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:38,250
play with a playstation or we 
communicate with his colleague,

33
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:40,980
the Sultan on a series of Cairo,
Mansa,

34
00:01:40,981 --> 00:01:42,690
Musa,
I know whatsapp,

35
00:01:42,810 --> 00:01:45,000
facebook or mobile phone.
Of course,

36
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:46,043
he was never able to cure a headache 
with an aspirin and I don't think that 

37
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:52,380
100 years ago things were really much 
better and that's fine.

38
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,273
John Rockefeller,
the well known oil magnates couldn't 

39
00:01:55,081 --> 00:01:58,290
even watch television and listen to the 
radio or use antibiotic.

40
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:04,300
These luxury is simply did not exist.
Yes,

41
00:02:04,301 --> 00:02:07,540
that is absolutely right.
If it is me making this decision on,

42
00:02:07,541 --> 00:02:08,374
you know what I would choose,
I would absolutely choose a current 

43
00:02:11,350 --> 00:02:12,610
middle class life.

44
00:02:20,740 --> 00:02:21,060
Indeed

45
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,893
I would avoid going back to the past as 
much as I possibly could because saying 

46
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:27,080
things were better back then simply 
isn't.

47
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:28,640
Of course

48
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:31,490
all of this shouldn't really surprise 
you either.

49
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:33,860
After all innovation,
technological development,

50
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:37,400
they've always been the main drivers for
improving people's quality of life

51
00:02:37,510 --> 00:02:40,320
picture and sound coming together.
It's just like that.

52
00:02:44,250 --> 00:02:44,500
Well,

53
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,333
regarding this,
I do have some good news for you and 

54
00:02:47,291 --> 00:02:49,990
also unfortunately I've got some bad 
news.

55
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,883
The good news is the all evidence 
suggests we are on the threshold of a 

56
00:02:53,951 --> 00:02:54,784
new era of revolutionary changes,
changes that only seems possible in 

57
00:02:58,541 --> 00:02:59,510
science,
novels,

58
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,280
previous

59
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,113
slate

60
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:05,080
and trucks that drive themselves.
Biotechnology,

61
00:03:05,090 --> 00:03:06,600
robotics,
nano technology,

62
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:07,434
artificial intelligence for simply the 
ability to share knowledge on a massive 

63
00:03:10,641 --> 00:03:14,900
scale through the clouds.
These are just a few of the huge changes

64
00:03:14,901 --> 00:03:15,734
that are absolutely going to be coming.
The bad news is that several experts 

65
00:03:19,641 --> 00:03:24,110
state that both the speed and depth of 
these changes have been slowing down for

66
00:03:24,111 --> 00:03:25,240
decades.
This means,

67
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,074
but all of these technological miracles 
could take a long time to arrive or 

68
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,030
actually might never even arrive at all.

69
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,230
The big rake.

70
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:44,360
The last 20 years of the 19th century 
and the first 50 of the 20th century for

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:46,680
something like a golden age of 
innovation.

72
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:47,543
The changes that occurred in those few 
decades was so great that even today 

73
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,640
they seem like magic.
See,

74
00:03:53,641 --> 00:03:56,580
many technologies were developed in 
those times such as the automobile,

75
00:03:56,581 --> 00:03:57,600
airplanes,
antibiotics,

76
00:03:57,601 --> 00:03:58,860
electricity,
nuclear energy,

77
00:03:58,861 --> 00:04:00,570
insecticides,
and many,

78
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:01,463
many,
many more things that really did change 

79
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:04,914
people's lives forever.
With all of these changes in a little 

80
00:04:07,891 --> 00:04:08,724
more than 50 years,
humanity has stopped riding on horses 

81
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:14,250
and found themselves able to travel to 
the moon.

82
00:04:26,310 --> 00:04:27,143
Things into perspective.
Let's have a look at the airplanes 

83
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,040
evolution.
This went from being something like this

84
00:04:32,041 --> 00:04:32,874
at the beginning of the 20th century to 
something like this in the 50 

85
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:36,744
[inaudible].

86
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:39,943
Okay,

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:42,533
let's take a look at how cars changed.
This is how they were at first and then 

88
00:04:46,141 --> 00:04:49,070
this is how they were in the 1950s no 
mama.

89
00:04:50,030 --> 00:04:50,863
Oh good.

90
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:55,670
Do you guys are gene?

91
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,370
We could

92
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,203
even mentioned the microwave.
It's technology that in a short time 

93
00:05:03,491 --> 00:05:04,324
went from being a theory to being used 
in large rate panels and in virtually 

94
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:08,950
every

95
00:05:08,950 --> 00:05:09,783
kitchen.

96
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,653
The electricity.
We went from candles to light bulbs and 

97
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:16,874
in a short amount of time communications
went from carrier pigeons to the First 

98
00:05:19,551 --> 00:05:22,280
Telegraph and the telephone.
It came soon after that.

99
00:05:22,370 --> 00:05:23,203
In other words,
we are talking about eight spectacular 

100
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:29,180
rates of technological developments 
since then.

101
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,410
Let's just say that things they've 
improved but not really so much

102
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,440
playing planes.

103
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,273
They are basically still the same.
Now they are safer and they are more 

104
00:05:41,591 --> 00:05:44,950
comfortable,
but it's still the same technology.

105
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,873
In fact,
we could say that the only field where 

106
00:05:47,081 --> 00:05:51,220
several disruptive innovations have 
occurred has been in the digital world.

107
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:53,063
So now for you,
the only question we really need to 

108
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:56,020
answer is,
well,

109
00:05:56,050 --> 00:05:56,883
what actually happens?
Why are things going full steam in the 

110
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:02,630
digital wells and not so much in the 
other fields?

111
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,880
Well,
some people like Peter Teal have a clear

112
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,830
idea why I'm check this out.

113
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:10,090
We've had a lot of innovation in 
computers,

114
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:12,190
information technology,
Internet,

115
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,440
mobile,
Internet in the world of bits,

116
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:17,950
not so much in the world of Adam's 
supersonic travel space,

117
00:06:17,951 --> 00:06:19,750
travel,
new forms of energy,

118
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:22,390
new forms of medicine,
new medical devices,

119
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,523
et cetera.
I would say that we lived in a world in 

120
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:29,320
which bits were unregulated and Adams 
were regulated.

121
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:30,363
Peter Teal.

122
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:30,860
All right,
sir,

123
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,451
said,
wait a minute.

124
00:06:31,451 --> 00:06:36,070
Is Pizza deal saying that some bad 
regulations are holding innovation back?

125
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:36,963
Well,
you know he's not actually the only one 

126
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,814
who's saying this.
Many experts argue the innovation has 

127
00:06:44,321 --> 00:06:48,400
been facing what can be called an almost
a perfect storm for years.

128
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:50,830
This is a storm composed of,
among other things,

129
00:06:50,831 --> 00:06:54,040
excessive regulations,
patterns and way too much

130
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:54,963
predict

131
00:06:56,970 --> 00:06:59,340
post.
When we talk about holding innovation,

132
00:06:59,341 --> 00:07:00,174
we need to know we are talking about 
nothing all ask the whole thing 

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:03,833
progress.
We are slowing down technologies that 

134
00:07:05,971 --> 00:07:06,804
could greatly improve our lives from 
taking planes in space to the cure for 

135
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:10,420
yeah,

136
00:07:10,420 --> 00:07:15,420
cancer paralyzed by fear.

137
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,210
Yes,
so it is true.

138
00:07:23,211 --> 00:07:27,320
Regulations do aim to improve safety and
the quality of life for citizens,

139
00:07:27,350 --> 00:07:30,050
but intentions are one thing and 
results.

140
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:30,913
That's something completely different.
Politicians often forget that 

141
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:33,674
regulations also have negative 
consequences and of course if there are 

142
00:07:36,441 --> 00:07:39,440
a lot of regulations,
consequences can be quite negative.

143
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,940
Let's take a look at,
for example,

144
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:44,420
what is happening in the pharmaceutical 
research industry in the European Union,

145
00:07:44,421 --> 00:07:47,720
which is of course a world leader in 
Samsung regulations.

146
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:53,450
No,
how important medical and pharmaceutical

147
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,720
research is and how it can improve our 
lives.

148
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,583
Well,
these huge regulations because the 

149
00:07:59,121 --> 00:07:59,954
development of new medicines to take 
more than 10 years and we're not only 

150
00:08:03,261 --> 00:08:04,910
talking about the time it takes for 
laboratories,

151
00:08:04,911 --> 00:08:05,744
do comply with all the regulations here,
even after they finally obtained 

152
00:08:08,630 --> 00:08:11,000
authorization from the European 
medicines agency,

153
00:08:11,001 --> 00:08:11,834
if they still have to wait one more year
to launch their product into the market 

154
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,430
simply because of bureaucracy.
Of course,

155
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:22,620
this all has pretty major consequences 
for one,

156
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,650
they on greatly to lengthy innovative 
process,

157
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,460
which is extensively based on past 
experience for another.

158
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,353
They make research incredibly expensive.
We're talking about 10 or 12 years 

159
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:36,970
investing a lot of money without the 
chance of earning anything right

160
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,340
now.
Of course,

161
00:08:43,341 --> 00:08:46,700
prudence and ensuring safety is 
absolutely important,

162
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,370
but 10 to 12 years because of excessive 
bureaucracy.

163
00:08:49,371 --> 00:08:51,680
I mean maybe that playing it a bit too 
safe here.

164
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,340
Okay.
And there's

165
00:08:53,630 --> 00:08:55,590
another detail that we absolutely cannot
here.

166
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:56,473
The monopolization that in some way all 
these regulations create for big 

167
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,800
pharmaceutical multinationals.
Yes,

168
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:02,730
you heard that,
right.

169
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,840
Those who benefit the most from this 
hyper regulation are precisely the large

170
00:09:06,870 --> 00:09:08,340
pharmaceutical companies themselves.

171
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:13,980
Of course,

172
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,813
if small authorities can't cope with all
these costs in the market is changing 

173
00:09:17,851 --> 00:09:21,090
less because there's less innovation to 
the large companies have a secure,

174
00:09:21,210 --> 00:09:22,450
large and stable.
Yeah,

175
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:28,120
and the pharmaceutical industry,
this is just one example.

176
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,270
Let me reiterate here because I don't 
want to be mistaken.

177
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,104
Regulations are absolutely important,
but we need to be very careful about 

178
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:38,320
piper regulation because when we pile on
too many demands,

179
00:09:38,321 --> 00:09:39,154
we increased prices and we hope the 
progress that improves people's lives 

180
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:43,630
the most,
which is of course

181
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,120
innovation.
Who gets it?

182
00:09:45,121 --> 00:09:47,280
Who gets to write the regular 
regulations?

183
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,600
The bureaucrats,
right?

184
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:50,520
The regulations,
but who writes the laws?

185
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:51,533
The lobbyists have controls,
so it's a lobbyists from the drug 

186
00:09:53,761 --> 00:09:56,550
industry has control of writing.
The regulations.

187
00:10:03,260 --> 00:10:05,730
Example of the,
of all of this is mobile technology.

188
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:10,260
Did you know that this technology was 
first developed in the 1940s yeah,

189
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,580
that's right.
Mobile communication,

190
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:12,443
it's really not as new as it seems and 
the 1940s the mts mobile telephone 

191
00:10:16,501 --> 00:10:18,450
service began to be developed.
It was a standard.

192
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,090
They use radio waves to connect to a 
landline with a mobile phone,

193
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,740
but of course now you may be wondering,
well,

194
00:10:22,741 --> 00:10:25,770
why the hell did it take so long for 
this technology to mature?

195
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,641
I mean,
at the end of the day,

196
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,474
the first modern mobile phones didn't 
appear until the late eighties I didn't 

197
00:10:30,241 --> 00:10:32,790
become popular until the late nineties 
well,

198
00:10:32,791 --> 00:10:37,050
the answer to view at comes from 
political class and regulations.

199
00:10:39,350 --> 00:10:41,900
If we are to ignore the cost of 
regulations,

200
00:10:41,901 --> 00:10:46,790
if we are to ignore the relationship 
between regulations and job loss,

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,833
there is basically no limit to the 
fervor and ferocity that will be 

202
00:10:51,261 --> 00:10:55,910
unleashed by bureaucrats who's perpetual
mandate is to regulate.

203
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,560
See

204
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,393
the US federal communications commission
and managers by law and grants licenses 

205
00:11:01,211 --> 00:11:02,044
to the so-called radio spectrum.
This is how electromagnetic radio 

206
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:06,544
frequencies are transmitted.
That is the signals that allow for 

207
00:11:09,551 --> 00:11:13,710
telecommunication.
Well,

208
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,460
when companies were investing in 
developing mobile technology back in the

209
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:19,980
1950s the federal communications 
commission,

210
00:11:19,981 --> 00:11:20,814
which is after all a political body,
decided that all mobile phones 

211
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:27,480
technology wasn't very important and 
that the radio spectrum,

212
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:31,440
how to be used to boost another nascent 
technology television.

213
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:34,410
The idea here that television was indeed
much more useful.

214
00:11:36,540 --> 00:11:37,920
Totally.
I'm fantastical.

215
00:11:37,921 --> 00:11:39,930
I'd met all know all the PV industry.

216
00:11:40,110 --> 00:11:40,943
Now,
this is something that today we can 

217
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:44,310
debate,
but the fact is that a large part of the

218
00:11:44,311 --> 00:11:48,510
spectrum was assigned to television so 
much more than was actually needed.

219
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:51,480
That means that those technologies could
have been developed at the same time,

220
00:11:51,481 --> 00:11:55,870
but the regulator simply did not see a 
future in mobile communications.

221
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,390
That's not it.
In in 1973 in motor read,

222
00:11:59,391 --> 00:12:00,224
the Vice President Marty Cooper,
who is considered the father of mobile 

223
00:12:02,291 --> 00:12:06,070
phones to make the first call with one 
of these devices that we all use today.

224
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,450
Yes,
you did not miss any of that date.

225
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:08,284
The first mobile phone call actually 
happened way back in the 1970s but once 

226
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:12,783
a game,
the regulator intervened and decided 

227
00:12:14,711 --> 00:12:19,360
that competition wasn't possible in 
mobile telephones and assigns the entire

228
00:12:19,361 --> 00:12:20,830
monopoly to a t.
And.

229
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:21,664
T.

230
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:24,010
Yes,

231
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:24,843
I think we can say that politicians and 
regulators didn't hit the market tool 

232
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,683
and ended up delaying the development of
mobile communications by more than 40 

233
00:12:33,671 --> 00:12:34,810
years.
All right,

234
00:12:34,811 --> 00:12:37,180
so that was the case in the United 
States,

235
00:12:37,181 --> 00:12:39,530
but in Europe things they were also 
going down a similar

236
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:43,840
entity

237
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:44,850
for you.
Think about it,

238
00:12:44,851 --> 00:12:45,684
it's actually quite normal because 
research and innovation are for 

239
00:12:47,911 --> 00:12:51,270
scientists and entrepreneurs and not for
politicians.

240
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:52,790
In fact,
this is the problem.

241
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,673
Many public r and D programs face who 
cannot work because their work is 

242
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:00,920
determined by politicians and by 
bureaucrats are visual politic.

243
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:01,763
We've already discussed how governments 
can play a prominent role in research 

244
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:04,674
development and investing,
but need to do so while being aware of 

245
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:08,814
their limitations.
This is actually what has happened in 

246
00:13:14,901 --> 00:13:16,760
Israel as we saw with,
he yells in my program,

247
00:13:16,790 --> 00:13:17,623
which gave leadership to investors,
entrepreneurs and scientists who worked 

248
00:13:21,201 --> 00:13:23,330
in a competitive market.
If this isn't done,

249
00:13:23,331 --> 00:13:26,300
programs and public aid can actually be 
really counterproductive.

250
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,223
They can raise the costs of r and D and 
I hinder startups progress and 

251
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,330
ultimately holtz technological 
developments and innovations,

252
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,610
which are the best ways,
as we've mentioned,

253
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:36,380
to improve everyone's quality of life.

254
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,291
All right,
well,

255
00:13:39,291 --> 00:13:40,760
having settled with that,
now it's your turn.

256
00:13:40,790 --> 00:13:41,623
Which countries do you think are going 
to lead the future of the technological 

257
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:45,704
race?
