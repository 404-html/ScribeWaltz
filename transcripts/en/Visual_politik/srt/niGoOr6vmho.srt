1
00:00:08,030 --> 00:00:08,700
Okay.

2
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:11,580
Located between the Pacific Ocean and 
the Caribbean Sea.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:12,443
We could say Columbia is something like 
the entry and exit door of South 

4
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:17,760
America.
You know what?

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:20,040
Well this,
this is Columbia,

6
00:00:20,130 --> 00:00:22,920
the long and it's cheerful beaches of 
Santa Marta.

7
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:23,953
The lower he red desert,
the inaccessible the teeth.capital of 

8
00:00:27,361 --> 00:00:31,780
the leafy Colombian Amazon rain forest.
Then there are the islands of San Andres

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,740
and providence.
Yeah,

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:33,623
the coffee bells of Quinn Dio,
cal drows and raise Eraldo and then 

11
00:00:36,361 --> 00:00:39,970
there are of course the vibrant cities 
of Midean Kelly or baron Quia,

12
00:00:42,140 --> 00:00:42,973
and we can't forget about the historical
and proud Carter he know or the Frantic 

13
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:46,520
Bogus,

14
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,353
Huh?

15
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,070
Very good.
I'll be in the great capital city of the

16
00:00:50,071 --> 00:00:50,904
country that dear viewers with its 
candelaria and it's incredible museums 

17
00:00:53,971 --> 00:00:57,210
of Golden Arch.
We'll leave you absolutely speechless.

18
00:00:57,240 --> 00:00:58,073
Yes.
We can't really be surprised that more 

19
00:00:58,891 --> 00:01:03,891
and more travel companies are making 
Columbia a 100% must visit destination.

20
00:01:03,950 --> 00:01:05,520
Right.
As you might've guessed this video,

21
00:01:05,521 --> 00:01:08,190
it's not going to be about tourism in 
Colombia.

22
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:09,083
Not at all.
It's politics that we do here at visual 

23
00:01:11,071 --> 00:01:13,010
politic.
I mean it's right there in the name.

24
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:17,283
May,
2018 Columbia will have its next 

25
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:20,433
presidential election and by August 7th 
whoever wind will have begun his new 

26
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:26,020
job.
Juan Manuel Santos,

27
00:01:26,230 --> 00:01:30,190
the current president cannot run again 
as he has reached his two term limit.

28
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,290
Santos is tying is coming to an end with
this video.

29
00:01:34,291 --> 00:01:38,190
We want to take a look ahead and to find
out what kind of Columbia he is going to

30
00:01:38,191 --> 00:01:39,024
leave to his successor.
We're going to have a look at the great 

31
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:42,750
things.
Well,

32
00:01:42,760 --> 00:01:43,593
there's the not so great.

33
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,193
Yeah.

34
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:47,530
Days.
Columbia,

35
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,563
a gambling man,
a great poker player and part of one of 

36
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:53,690
the most influential families in 
Colombia.

37
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:55,940
This is Juan Manuel Santos.

38
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:57,703
Even his great uncle at the water though
Santos was President of Columbia in the 

39
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,710
late thirties his family also owned a 
temple,

40
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:07,400
the most influential newspaper in the 
country.

41
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:11,690
It's the very same.
Juan Manuel Santos was for a long time.

42
00:02:11,691 --> 00:02:14,570
Deputy director ans a colonist apps,
the newspaper.

43
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,050
What do we are trying to say is that 
this family,

44
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:20,210
they've never lacked influence money or 
power.

45
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:25,210
Sorry,

46
00:02:25,210 --> 00:02:26,043
off to two times the 7th of August,
2017 marks the end of his time as 

47
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:31,300
president.
And to be honest,

48
00:02:31,490 --> 00:02:35,360
his level of popularity,
it's pretty much shot rock in Boston.

49
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,273
This is even after winning the Nobel 
Peace Prize due to the deal that he got 

50
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,174
with FARC.
The latest poll numbers when we're 

51
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,273
making this video showed that 65 to 75% 
of Columbian people disapprove of his 

52
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,520
governance.
So the question now is,

53
00:02:48,521 --> 00:02:49,354
how does the Nobel prize winning leader 
have such strong disapproval ratings 

54
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:54,034
from his own?
Perhaps it has to do with this broken 

55
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:00,100
promise about

56
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,140
the peace deal with foc.
Remember,

57
00:03:02,141 --> 00:03:05,710
he assured them that it was going to be 
the Colombian people and no one else.

58
00:03:05,711 --> 00:03:09,520
You were going to have the last word on 
the deal and well,

59
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:12,580
let's just say that Santos forgot all 
about that.

60
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:16,820
Columbia referendum voters reject peace,
deal with bark,

61
00:03:16,821 --> 00:03:18,260
gorillas,
Colombia,

62
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,540
the FARC sign,
new peace deal.

63
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:22,610
This time skipping voters

64
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:24,000
bosses.
Apart from all of this.

65
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:27,420
If there is really something that can 
make an assumption low ratings,

66
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:29,790
well,
while I won't have to be via economy.

67
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:31,140
Yep.
During the last decade,

68
00:03:31,141 --> 00:03:33,480
this Pacific Kuma called Columbia,
well,

69
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,373
you know,
it used to have quite strong grief and 

70
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:39,300
it even became one of the most thriving 
of the Latin American countries.

71
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,150
However,
lately things have been emailed a little

72
00:03:42,151 --> 00:03:46,140
bit difference that actually they've 
been really quite a lot different.

73
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,880
I mean,
have a look at this chart.

74
00:03:52,210 --> 00:03:55,810
Columbia is facing a situation of slow 
down,

75
00:03:55,811 --> 00:03:59,170
which is really much closer to what we'd
call stagnation.

76
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,033
The latest growth figures show a year on
year increase of slightly above 1% and 

77
00:04:03,821 --> 00:04:07,840
2017 forecasts don't seem to be that 
much better at all

78
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:14,330
be as economic growth rate will be 1.5% 
in 2017 according to bb va research.

79
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:18,410
As you can see,
this is really not a good figure,

80
00:04:18,430 --> 00:04:19,263
especially if we consider that most of 
the richest countries are growing at 

81
00:04:22,531 --> 00:04:24,210
higher rates.
The United States,

82
00:04:24,211 --> 00:04:24,901
Canada,
Spain,

83
00:04:24,901 --> 00:04:25,590
Germany,
UK,

84
00:04:25,590 --> 00:04:30,500
all of them will grow more than Columbia
in 2017 as well.

85
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,650
It's kind of supposed to be that when 
you're a poorer country you grow more.

86
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,310
This is because of something that is 
called economic convergence.

87
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,173
So well now the question has to become 
what's going on in Colombia and he 

88
00:04:42,331 --> 00:04:43,164
blamed the situation on the fall of oil 
and commodity prices and you know in a 

89
00:04:47,251 --> 00:04:48,084
way this is sort of rice,
but there are some nuances that we do 

90
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,920
need to consider.
Now,

91
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:54,754
it is true that it,
its climax in 2013 oil did represent 

92
00:04:57,581 --> 00:05:00,310
more than 50% of all the country's 
exports.

93
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,203
More than 30% of all foreign direct 
investments has more than 20% of public 

94
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:06,154
reserve.

95
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:08,330
But it's

96
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:11,390
also true that for many years,
thanks to the high oil prices,

97
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:12,224
the governance of Columbia has had more 
resources than it's ever happened 

98
00:05:14,921 --> 00:05:15,754
before.
Resources that could have been used to 

99
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:18,074
boost a productive and competitive 
economy unrelated to those original 

100
00:05:21,591 --> 00:05:22,424
commodities.
And this is something if at the Santos 

101
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,350
Administration seems to not really have 
done,

102
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,570
perhaps this is because they've been 
dedicated.

103
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:33,290
This is almost exclusively to that peace
deal with fuck.

104
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:34,273
Anyway,
let's now have a look at what are the 

105
00:05:35,930 --> 00:05:38,780
main weaknesses of the Colombian 
economy?

106
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:46,930
Disastrous infrastructure.
For years Columbia's been,

107
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:51,410
I'll should we say it's almost a failed 
state in many areas.

108
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,260
These are areas that were controlled by 
warlords,

109
00:05:54,261 --> 00:05:57,890
gorillas and militias and narchos.
All of those things,

110
00:05:57,950 --> 00:05:58,783
so now imagine how difficult it would be
to manage such a country ans build 

111
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,744
complex infrastructure there.
But really the reality is that that's 

112
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:05,920
not the whole school,

113
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:06,753
Laurie.

114
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:11,143
The reality is that infrastructure has 
never been a major priority for any 

115
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:17,330
Colombian government and the results of 
this,

116
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:20,270
it's pretty obvious.
The infrastructure in Colombia,

117
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:23,540
it's really,
really bad today to describe Columbia is

118
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,030
infrastructure that we can use.
Really any other word,

119
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,520
the dreadful,
most of their paved roads,

120
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:31,150
they're in a state of total disrepair as
well.

121
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,550
Was the result of all of this and do you
pay close attention to this?

122
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:36,440
Because while there's almost 
unbelievable

123
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,833
football

124
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:41,473
container within the country is twice as
expensive as in Mexico or Bolivia and 

125
00:06:45,561 --> 00:06:49,430
four times more expensive than in 
Argentina Gla or,

126
00:06:49,780 --> 00:06:50,613
and in fact the situation is so 
disastrous that free transport between 

127
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,010
the Colombian ports of,
of interior around Bogota is three times

128
00:06:58,011 --> 00:07:01,220
more expensive than moving the same load
from a rotterdam,

129
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,203
Frank Franklin.

130
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:06,010
Interestingly,
there are some reports that claimed that

131
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:06,844
sending a container from Carta Haina is 
a blue guitar costs three times more 

132
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:11,680
than sending it to Shanghai.

133
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,613
Hi,

134
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:18,133
so now you can probably imagine all of 
the effects that this has on supply 

135
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:21,404
costs,
prices and the competitiveness of 

136
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:27,530
Colombian companies.
According to a recent OACD report,

137
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:28,393
Columbia is the third world's most 
expensive country from which to export 

138
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:32,804
containers after Venezuela and Russia.
That's why Hahnemann well sent us 

139
00:07:36,771 --> 00:07:41,771
decided in 2010 to make changing.
This is top priority and it is true.

140
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:42,734
That is government has just released the
biggest infrastructure plan in the 

141
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:49,220
history of Columbia.
A private co-funded plan,

142
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:53,060
which under a concessionary system is 
actually pretty attractive.

143
00:07:56,100 --> 00:08:01,100
Bye.
[inaudible] must which three study?

144
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:07,370
Yes.

145
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,203
This plan,
it actually seems to be well designed 

146
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:10,423
bars after seven years.
It's just a bit too late and it still 

147
00:08:13,671 --> 00:08:16,520
comes with many problems.
Is that the honest during his two terms,

148
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:17,354
Santos achievements are really haven't 
been as good as he promised that they 

149
00:08:20,391 --> 00:08:21,670
were going to be.

150
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,380
Your rocker C and taxes

151
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:31,650
both the World Economic Forum,
I'm the world's bank,

152
00:08:31,651 --> 00:08:32,484
confirmed the Columbia is one of the 
countries with the highest taxes on 

153
00:08:35,331 --> 00:08:36,164
companies in the wells,
which is obviously something that 

154
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:39,734
doesn't help companies to grow and 
develop according to the paying taxes 

155
00:08:42,981 --> 00:08:45,770
reports that every year price waterhouse
coopers publishers,

156
00:08:45,830 --> 00:08:46,663
the total of all taxes,
the declan via and the company has to 

157
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:53,020
pay is 69.8% of their pre tax port.

158
00:08:57,370 --> 00:09:02,080
That's almost 70% which is significantly
higher than in countries like Germany,

159
00:09:02,081 --> 00:09:03,520
Spain,
the United States.

160
00:09:03,521 --> 00:09:05,470
To be honest,
it's pretty insane.

161
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:08,260
I think that's not even mentioning the 
bureaucracy,

162
00:09:08,261 --> 00:09:11,680
which has an almost equal level of pure 
insanity.

163
00:09:11,710 --> 00:09:12,543
Once they were really gonna have to make
a video about the passion for 

164
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,390
bureaucracy.
The last in America seems to have a book

165
00:09:16,391 --> 00:09:17,224
because it would be really long.
We're not going to touch on it in 

166
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:21,520
today's video.
It's just too huge of a topic.

167
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:24,330
But what we can say is that on an 
average day in Columbia,

168
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:27,370
15 rules and three decrees are issued.

169
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:30,680
Okay?

170
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,830
Yes,
really every single day,

171
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:34,963
not just that,
but according to research conducted by 

172
00:09:36,231 --> 00:09:37,064
the University of last banner,
more than 30% of the laws passed are 

173
00:09:40,221 --> 00:09:41,054
useless.
Tans just create costs for Colombian 

174
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:44,054
society.
And so what is quantum mainwell Santos 

175
00:09:46,241 --> 00:09:48,400
has done to solve all of these issues?
Well,

176
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,810
he's done almost nothing.
In fact,

177
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:55,811
he has made the situation even worse.
Persistence,

178
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,823
violence.
It is true that many aspects where they 

179
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,530
to do security are improving in 
Colombia.

180
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,393
The uptick in the tourism industry in 
the country is pretty good evidence of 

181
00:10:08,981 --> 00:10:10,800
bass.
In 2016 fundings,

182
00:10:10,810 --> 00:10:11,643
million tourists visited the country,
which is twice the number from 2010 and 

183
00:10:14,490 --> 00:10:19,090
almost 10 times the number from 2000 
which is certainly not bad.

184
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,953
However,
despite this in many areas of the 

185
00:10:21,551 --> 00:10:23,530
country,
the situation,

186
00:10:23,590 --> 00:10:25,110
it's not really improving.

187
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,470
Okay.

188
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:27,303
Cording to the United Nations and the 
Colombian conflict analysis resource 

189
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:31,684
center,
there is still violence in the most 

190
00:10:33,101 --> 00:10:33,934
affected areas of the country.
That is the FARC peace deal has not 

191
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,880
substantially improved the situation in 
these areas.

192
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:42,213
For example,
kept on growing and cocaine refining is 

193
00:10:44,731 --> 00:10:47,910
at its absolute highest.
Me Just have a look at this chart,

194
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:52,573
so well now you might be wondering how 
is it possible that violence levels and 

195
00:10:55,731 --> 00:10:56,564
the production of illicit substances has
not been reduced since the governments 

196
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:00,734
deal with fuck?
Well that's because responding to all 

197
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,060
the marketing from the government's 
Indwell,

198
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,903
the violence by FARC was huge.
It actually represents it less than 10% 

199
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:09,643
of the nation's total violence and more 
over the areas that FARC have left have 

200
00:11:13,071 --> 00:11:16,640
not been occupied by government 
institutions but by other Naco ends,

201
00:11:16,641 --> 00:11:17,474
militia groups,
some of them even having a mutual 

202
00:11:19,251 --> 00:11:22,130
agreement with fog after all the 
business,

203
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:22,993
it's still very attractive.
Now the peace deal left and many things 

204
00:11:25,461 --> 00:11:26,294
up in the APP and that's why these so 
called peace dividends is not giving 

205
00:11:29,301 --> 00:11:31,490
results as big as the government 
promised.

206
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,353
Now to be fair though,
not everything has been totally bad 

207
00:11:34,491 --> 00:11:36,170
under Santos,
his presidency,

208
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:47,030
the best of the centers administration,
we have to admit that Juan Manuel Santos

209
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:48,384
has achieved some pretty good things is 
government actually brought Columbia to 

210
00:11:51,151 --> 00:11:54,520
the Pacific alliance and this is another
thing going to talk about in an upcoming

211
00:11:54,521 --> 00:11:56,410
video,
so do not forget to subscribe,

212
00:11:56,411 --> 00:11:58,820
hit that button below.
Of course it's foreign agenda.

213
00:11:58,821 --> 00:12:01,210
It has been a great strength of his 
government.

214
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:04,510
Columbia today is more open to the world
than it ever has been before,

215
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,403
so that poverty has been reduced 
considerably and the country has 

216
00:12:07,961 --> 00:12:09,910
attracted lots of foreign investment.

217
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,150
Bye.

218
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:15,983
Despite all of this,
our impression here at visual politic 

219
00:12:17,521 --> 00:12:18,354
isn't the arrival of a new government 
can really be a positive turning point 

220
00:12:21,901 --> 00:12:24,540
for Columbia.
When one manual Santos took office,

221
00:12:24,570 --> 00:12:25,403
the country seemed to be ready to tackle
a real process of transformation and 

222
00:12:28,891 --> 00:12:32,040
their oil resources meds that they have 
the ability to pay for us.

223
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:33,690
However,
this as of yes,

224
00:12:33,691 --> 00:12:35,760
it simply hasn't been achieved.
In fact,

225
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,594
it's kind of been the opposite.
Santos leaves a weak economic Columbia 

226
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,510
and many more future prospects than 
current realities.

227
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:46,380
So now we'd love to know your opinion.
What do you think the future of Columbia

228
00:12:46,381 --> 00:12:47,214
will be?
How would you rate Santos as a 

229
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,320
president?
Well,
