1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:12,300
The situation has been tense for years.
It's on June the fifth,

2
00:00:12,301 --> 00:00:13,134
2017.
Suddenly the conflict reached another 

3
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:20,180
dimension,
Arabia,

4
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,073
the Arab Emirates,
Bahrain and Egypt announced the 

5
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:26,600
fulminating rupture of their relations 
with the emirate of Qatar,

6
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:27,434
including the closing of borders and the
prohibition of the use of ports of 

7
00:00:30,741 --> 00:00:31,220
asked.

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:32,053
Nice.

9
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:37,190
Certainly old communication was cut off.
It was practically a total block aid.

10
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:38,053
The next night planes and cargo ships 
bound for Qatar were forced to change 

11
00:00:41,451 --> 00:00:43,580
course,
not even the camels were spared.

12
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:46,670
The Saudis immediately expelled is no 
less than 12,000

13
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:48,620
camels that were grazing in that 
country.

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:50,180
Yep.
You heard that right?

15
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:52,910
So were there any land border closed up 
in practical terms,

16
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:56,870
the emirate of Qatar went from being a 
peninsula to becoming an island,

17
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,090
threatens by its neighbors,
by land,

18
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,500
sea,
and air.

19
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:03,470
At the time this was happening,
these questions were asked,

20
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:04,333
how long can guitar hold on for?
Are we facing the preview to a military 

21
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,670
intervention and has this emirate 
splendor reached its end?

22
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:11,533
Well,
today in this video we're going to see 

23
00:01:12,141 --> 00:01:14,270
exactly what happens,
how things are today,

24
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:19,300
and what we can expect in the future 
results.

25
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,570
Now we are going to see the results,
but first,

26
00:01:29,571 --> 00:01:31,000
what you might be wondering,
bow,

27
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,350
did they get into this situation in the 
first place?

28
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:38,380
What the hell happened as an almost all 
disputes.

29
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:43,250
There are lots of reasons on the table,
but the truth is that the regardance Abu

30
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,083
Dhabi government swept tires.
If Guitar always being free than to 

31
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:47,523
bubble,
they wanted to cast off their growing 

32
00:01:49,131 --> 00:01:53,150
relations with Iran and closed down Al 
Jazeera once and for all.

33
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:55,220
In fact,

34
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:58,760
these were the basic conditions that 
were imposed on guitar in order to start

35
00:01:58,761 --> 00:01:59,594
a dialogue after agreeing on the 
blockades conditions that Doha outright 

36
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:05,540
rejects it.
But having said all of that,

37
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:06,374
let's get right to the point at first,
everyone bed that this whole mess would 

38
00:02:09,801 --> 00:02:14,240
be temporary and that it would resolve 
relatively quickly one way or another.

39
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,133
After all,
who would think that such a small 

40
00:02:16,101 --> 00:02:16,934
country,
the country that has barely 2 million 

41
00:02:18,321 --> 00:02:20,600
inhabitants and that is practically a 
desert,

42
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:23,860
would be able to resist for very long 
without simply giving up.

43
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,730
It seems pretty impossible,
right?

44
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:26,623
Well,
to view it,

45
00:02:26,630 --> 00:02:27,463
that's precisely what is happening.
It has not resulted in the way they 

46
00:02:31,881 --> 00:02:32,714
wanted it to.
They wanted to take control of our 

47
00:02:34,311 --> 00:02:38,120
decisions and get us to comply with 
their demands that has failed.

48
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:42,170
Katara will never be for sale to the 
blockade in countries or to anyone else.

49
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:46,250
We are a sovereign country.
We will remain a sovereign country safe.

50
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,113
I'll punny,
director of Qatar's government 

51
00:02:48,621 --> 00:02:50,630
communications office.
As you can imagine,

52
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:53,480
throughout the first few hours,
the emirate underwent a very,

53
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:54,343
very tense situation.
Many supplies including basic products 

54
00:02:57,231 --> 00:03:00,730
such as food stopped arriving,
the stock market collapsed,

55
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,650
and even the option of military 
intervention didn't seem far fetched.

56
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:06,543
After all,
the smoke Itsari army was no match for 

57
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,380
the billion dollar war machines of its 
neighboring countries.

58
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:13,660
Now,
a successful intervention that dependent

59
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:14,523
on the approval of the United States,
which has one of its most important 

60
00:03:17,441 --> 00:03:20,360
military bases in the world located in 
guitar,

61
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:21,483
even though this approval was likely 
just in case heart decided to ask for 

62
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,134
Istanbul's help,
Turkish parliament approved spill to 

63
00:03:38,691 --> 00:03:41,660
deploy troops in Qatar the situation 
well,

64
00:03:41,661 --> 00:03:44,750
it was looking to be quite difficult and
quite complex,

65
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:47,360
but hold on a moment because Qatar well 
bad,

66
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,860
another ace up their sleeve as we told 
you,

67
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:52,720
you in a previous video in recent years,
the Emirates,

68
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,623
they've done their homework thanks to 
its oil and especially natural gas 

69
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:58,490
exploitation.
If the country has managed to accumulate

70
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,383
a fortune of more than $300,000,000,000
a fortune by the way that they've 

71
00:04:03,321 --> 00:04:04,910
invested all over the planet.

72
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,870
Yes,

73
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,233
and not only that,
but it also managed to become a country 

74
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:11,543
that's much more open to the world as a 
country with a foreign policy that's 

75
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,263
independent of its.
It's precisely what made this blockade 

76
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:23,310
total failure.

77
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:24,143
Yeah.

78
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:25,463
Blockade Strategy was corner us 
economically that has completely failed 

79
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:30,510
and it will not work.
Alisha reef,

80
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,880
I'll mid finance,
minister of Qatar.

81
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:33,853
You see,
in recent months the stock market has 

82
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,474
recovered investors,
they've stopped running away and even 

83
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:40,620
though many prices rose due to the 
blockade,

84
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:44,820
even the international monetary funds in
a report published on March the fifth,

85
00:04:44,821 --> 00:04:45,654
2018 stated that the Qatari economy 
would grow by almost three percent this 

86
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:50,140
year.

87
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:50,973
Yeah,

88
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,330
x is that the country hasn't only 
managed to open new commercial rates and

89
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,940
achieve alternatives to transport it's 
merchandise.

90
00:04:59,941 --> 00:05:03,330
Many multinationals like aged in Dubai,
you can no longer send that.

91
00:05:03,331 --> 00:05:07,680
People by playing to Doha have decided 
to open that own officers there.

92
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:09,060
This means that,
for example,

93
00:05:09,061 --> 00:05:09,894
the number of companies in the financial
center has grown by 70 percent in the 

94
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:19,400
last year,
past 15 years.

95
00:05:22,991 --> 00:05:25,540
We were the fastest growing economy on 
the planet.

96
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:30,420
You're talking about a $6,000,000,000
economy in 2000 turning into a $200,

97
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:31,263
billion dollar economy in 2015.
The blockading countries tried to make 

98
00:05:34,511 --> 00:05:36,940
businesses decide between them and 
Qatar,

99
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,310
but they backed away.
Yusuf Mohammed,

100
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:40,144
al Qaeda,
the head of the Qatar financial 

101
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:42,784
authority to view it.
It might actually seem that this 

102
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:48,430
blockade might actually ends up helping 
Qatar if you don't believe me well,

103
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:53,460
perhaps listens to this in Qatar.
Kate,

104
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:09,480
it has clearly been a challenge for the 
Qatari economy and their society.

105
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:10,343
Having an isolated country like that.
It's generally a really terrible deal 

106
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,160
now,
precisely due to that during this time,

107
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:18,053
one of the Emirates government's biggest
priorities has been to compensate for 

108
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:22,650
the blockades,
negative consequences,

109
00:06:22,651 --> 00:06:27,240
and convince investors that cutoff is 
still a good country to invest in

110
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,240
and to try and gain a lot of influence 
around the world.

111
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,133
This is something that's indispensable 
to prevent it to nate as especially 

112
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:39,320
Saudi Arabia from guessing future 
expansionist temptations,

113
00:06:39,350 --> 00:06:40,490
but now you may be wondering,
well,

114
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,960
how can they achieve out of this?

115
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:51,163
Well,

116
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:52,313
one way is by pushing reformance and 
that's something they've done in recent 

117
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:57,023
months.
The Qatari government has promoted 

118
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,523
several changes to improve the country's
image in the world and to be more 

119
00:07:01,561 --> 00:07:03,870
competitive for international investors.

120
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:09,530
For example,
visas have been removed for more than 80

121
00:07:09,531 --> 00:07:10,364
countries.
The rights of foreign residents have 

122
00:07:11,421 --> 00:07:14,600
increased and more free zones have been 
established.

123
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:18,410
Further two very important changes have 
been announced for one,

124
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,273
they called for elections for the very 
first time to elect members for the 

125
00:07:22,190 --> 00:07:25,370
consultive assembling something like a 
local parliaments.

126
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,830
Now this is a pretty limited 
parliaments,

127
00:07:27,831 --> 00:07:28,664
but at least it's a step in the right 
direction and this is a particularly 

128
00:07:31,311 --> 00:07:34,670
important step when we account for the 
fact that we're talking about is a place

129
00:07:34,671 --> 00:07:35,504
that still works with a political system
based on absolute monarchy and for 

130
00:07:38,871 --> 00:07:40,880
another.
The more than reprehensible could follow

131
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:41,723
system will be coming to an end.
This is a system that makes foreign 

132
00:07:43,791 --> 00:07:45,290
workers,
especially the poorest,

133
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,153
have to rely on their employers for that
visa and legal status and has very few 

134
00:07:49,671 --> 00:07:52,250
legal repercussions for exploitation 
making,

135
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,530
working conditions very,
very bad.

136
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:57,470
In some cases,
you've probably heard of the allegations

137
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,930
about slave workers in the Persian Gulf.
Well,

138
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:01,820
this is what we're talking about.
However,

139
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,683
now with the latest labor changes,
all of these workers will have better 

140
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:05,984
protected rights and we'll be able to 
change jobs or leave the country 

141
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:09,433
whenever they want.
All of these reforms would have taken a 

142
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:14,960
lot longer were it not?
For the blockade,

143
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:17,570
it's been a blessing in disguise when it
comes to business.

144
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,670
You see Mohammed algae,
Aida,

145
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:22,280
head of the Qatar financial authority.
In other words,

146
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:23,114
the blockade is achieving things that 
the international community has been 

147
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:28,250
demanding for years,
but having said that,

148
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,670
we still have a very,
very important question to answer.

149
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,533
Do you know what Qatar strategy has been
to gain influence in the world and 

150
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:37,250
strengthen its position?
Well,

151
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,173
listen up

152
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:50,810
the strategy.
We

153
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,000
all know that there are very economic 
sectors in the welds.

154
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,740
Well,
two industries in particular,

155
00:08:58,810 --> 00:08:59,643
standout one due to its ability to 
influence politics and another due to 

156
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:05,310
its ability to influence society.
Yes,

157
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:06,623
I'm talking about the military industry 
and the entertainment industry and you 

158
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,954
know what?
It's precisely in these industries that 

159
00:09:11,641 --> 00:09:13,770
Qatar has concentrated its strategy.

160
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:20,303
In recent months,
the Qatari government has announced 

161
00:09:22,231 --> 00:09:26,010
military contracts for more than 
$25,000,000,000

162
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:28,680
and yes,
one of their objectives is to equip that

163
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,240
army to,
if necessary,

164
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:34,560
make invasions more difficult.
But the truth is that no matter how much

165
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:35,394
they invest in weapons,
Catala Williams be able to replicate 

166
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,693
Saudi Arabia's military power.
But wait just a moment because there's 

167
00:09:41,491 --> 00:09:42,324
another objective,
what better way to influence Washington 

168
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:45,264
and get support than by making an 
industry that practically every 

169
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:50,370
government in the world consider 
strategic happy.

170
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:54,060
In this case,
most of the contracts went to the United

171
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:54,893
States and European countries that 
didn't support the blockade is whether 

172
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:59,280
United Kingdom,
France and Germany,

173
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,270
planes,
tanks,

174
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:03,450
helicopters,
Ms Dot [inaudible] is buying everything.

175
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:06,720
Of course it's never going to be able to
reach Saudi Arabia's level,

176
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:09,960
but it hasn't suddenly become a very 
prominent clients.

177
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:10,883
Yes.
The truth is that Qataris are really 

178
00:10:12,211 --> 00:10:14,700
experts in contracting security 
policies.

179
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,341
Hello,
by the way,

180
00:10:21,341 --> 00:10:22,174
don't hire resorts to announced that he 
wants to invest more money in our 

181
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,333
indies,

183
00:10:29,381 --> 00:10:32,540
soldiers and 100 deployed aircrafts 
including b,

184
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,120
Fifty two bombers.
As we mentioned,

185
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:38,140
it is one of the most important to 
United States spaces in the world.

186
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:42,340
Yes,

187
00:10:42,340 --> 00:10:46,150
it's really from Qatar where the United 
States projects it strengthened the area

188
00:10:46,210 --> 00:10:48,400
and this includes Fritz incursions into 
Iraq,

189
00:10:48,401 --> 00:10:49,570
Afghanistan,
Syria,

190
00:10:49,630 --> 00:10:50,980
etc.
Etc.

191
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,180
Etc.
By the way,

192
00:10:52,181 --> 00:10:53,014
the base cost a billion dollars and was 
a gift from the qatari government who 

193
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:59,380
also contributes to their expenses for.
YEah,

194
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:00,273
so yeah,
suffice to say it was really quite a 

195
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:02,110
bargain for washing

196
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:04,190
for us.
Thanks.

201
00:11:19,011 --> 00:11:21,980
naval base in its territory.
Now in the other industry,

202
00:11:21,981 --> 00:11:22,814
the entertainment industry,
guitar has Been moving like a fish in 

203
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:26,834
water for years,
especially as far as sports are 

204
00:11:28,971 --> 00:11:29,804
concerned.

205
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,510
In 2022,

206

competition broadcasting rights owners 
in the world.

212
00:11:53,710 --> 00:11:55,240
Well,
after announcing the blockades,

213
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:58,150
the qatari authorities decided to 
reinforce the strategy,

214
00:11:58,180 --> 00:11:59,013
which for example,
there's the psg to spend billions and 

215

with football and by pouring millions of

225
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:38,990
dollars into Washington lobbyists,
the Qatari government hopes to reinforce

226
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,480
its position and improve its image.
Now,

227

that rivals are also beginning to make 

228
00:12:43,881 --> 00:12:46,340
moves.
Say the battle is not over yet,

229
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,830
but that's something we can talk about 
another day.
