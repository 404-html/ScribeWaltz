1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
It's an image that will go down in 
history for the first time since plating

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:06,180
ends and in 1953 and North Korean leader
in this case,

3
00:00:06,181 --> 00:00:07,014
the ruthless dictator can Jong Uhmm 
Pacet ports in South Korea to declare 

4
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:13,830
his supposed intentions for peace and 
denuclearization.

5
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:16,140
Now the questions are,
is this really a moments of peace?

6
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:16,974
What can we expect?
Why does everything seem to suddenly be 

7
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:20,550
going so smoothly?
I mean,

8
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:24,060
is North Korea really willing to give up
that nuclear bomb?

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:24,913
Well,
it's a view of these are some of the 

10
00:00:25,201 --> 00:00:28,380
questions that I'm sure you are all 
thinking.

11
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:29,970
Well,
that's what we look at it.

12
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:30,804
Shall We?

13
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,160
Okay,
okay.

14
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:43,490
Humming while walking and even holding 
hands toasting and dining together.

15
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:44,353
This is how we were able to witness the 
north and South Korean leaders last 

16
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:52,960
Friday on April the 27th 2018 we're 
talking about the latest into Korea.

17
00:00:59,071 --> 00:00:59,904
Summit's in which both countries 
committed to seeking a definitive peace 

18
00:01:02,431 --> 00:01:03,390
agreements.
Technically,

19
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:04,224
both careers are still at Wachter 
rebuild their relations and pursue the 

20
00:01:06,931 --> 00:01:09,270
denuclearization of the Korean 
Peninsula.

21
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:10,153
There's something took place in the 
demilitarized zone in the town of Pam 

22
00:01:12,671 --> 00:01:16,190
and John in the exact place where the 
Korean War armistice was signed.

23
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:21,970
Okay.

24
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:25,480
Both the North Korean leader,
Kim Jong and South Korean president moon

25
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:26,343
giant displays a level of complicity 
that would have been very hard to 

26
00:01:29,231 --> 00:01:34,231
imagine only a few months ago pictures 
from that day.

27
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:40,190
They are going to go down in history,
and I'm really not exaggerating here.

28
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:41,083
The scenes that we saw of walks,
handshakes and whispers between the two 

29
00:01:43,851 --> 00:01:44,684
leaders,
what ends have been out of place in a 

30
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:46,730
romance movie.

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,240
Do you remember the honeymoon?
I promise you we're going to have it.

32
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,773
And you know what,
in a way that was precisely what was 

33
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,280
happening.
It was a political courtship between two

34
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:14,740
leaders who really couldn't be more 
different.

35
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,780
On the one hand you have the South 
Korean president,

36
00:02:20,781 --> 00:02:21,614
Moon Jan,
a lawyer who specialized in human 

37
00:02:23,181 --> 00:02:25,070
rights,
a man of humble origins,

38
00:02:25,071 --> 00:02:25,904
whose parents managed to flee from North
Korea and she was an activist for 

39
00:02:28,101 --> 00:02:29,450
democracy during his youth.

40
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:30,960
Okay.

41
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:31,793
And on the other hands we have Kim John 
and one of the worst tyrants on the 

42
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:34,974
planet's.
He's the omnipresent leader of one of 

43
00:02:36,001 --> 00:02:38,780
the most terrible countries that anyone 
could possibly imagine

44
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:40,770
because

45
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:43,930
my friends,
despite the summit's images in which Kim

46
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,070
Jong Un almost looked like a cab app,
let's not forget who we really is.

47
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,090
Let's not forget that the North Korean 
leader heads a regime of terror in which

48
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:54,630
human rights violations are part of the 
state's routine function.

49
00:02:56,010 --> 00:02:56,360
Cool.
Almost

50
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:00,400
forgotten the allegations that he had 
his half brother with a chemical weapon

51
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:04,600
just last year and then he had his uncle
ripped apart with anti aircraft guns.

52
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:07,600
Gary Samore,
Obama's White House coordinator for arms

53
00:03:07,601 --> 00:03:09,220
control and weapons of mass destruction.

54
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:10,243
In spite of that,
and thanks to the images we saw as the 

55
00:03:12,291 --> 00:03:13,124
declaration,
both governments agreed on most of the 

56
00:03:14,691 --> 00:03:17,420
press described this meeting as a 
historic day,

57
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:19,870
the day when,
once and for all peace tribe.

58
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,450
All right,
so now the question really has to be,

59
00:03:31,451 --> 00:03:32,980
well,
how true is all of this?

60
00:03:32,981 --> 00:03:35,670
Are things really going that well?
In other words,

61
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:36,504
are we facing east sincere exercise in 
diplomacy or simply a big marketing 

62
00:03:40,121 --> 00:03:42,940
scam?
Has Pyongyang roadmap actually changed?

63
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:46,890
Dialogue is certainly better than a 
march to war.

64
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,813
That said,
we all need to keep our expectations in 

65
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:51,270
check.
When Dr.

66
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:53,760
Sherman,
US Undersecretary of State for Political

67
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:54,594
Affairs from 2011 to 2015 and in North 
Korea policy coordinator in the Clinton 

68
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:58,914
administration,

69
00:03:58,930 --> 00:03:59,763
we'll explore this,
but first here's a question that I'm 

70
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,224
sure many of us have asked.
How the hell did we go in just a few 

71
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:06,970
months from hearing the drums of war?

72
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:08,560
Have you got time

73
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,790
assumption?
Well cordio and harmonious meeting.

74
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,123
Okay,

75
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:37,680
well we can come up with three different
explanations.

76
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:41,250
That's still compliments.
The North Korean regime is new behavior,

77
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,113
which in a very short time it wins from 
it threatening the United States to 

78
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:47,700
suspending its nuclear and missile 
tests.

79
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,530
Korea threatened to turn us into see a 
flames.

80
00:04:52,310 --> 00:04:55,880
North Korea says it will suspend nuclear
and missile tests.

81
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:59,020
So let's take a look at the possible 
reasons for this change.

82
00:04:59,021 --> 00:05:02,560
And let me tell you things are not as 
simple as they seem.

83
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:08,670
Okay?

84
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:10,440
Pyongyang.
We have a problem.

85
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:12,700
Okay.

86
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,533
The first possible explanation,
according to several analysts from the 

87
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:19,180
United States and South Korea in two 
studies by Chinese researchers,

88
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,043
the Pong,
every nuclear tests sensor located in 

89
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,384
the heart of a 2,200
meter high mountains in known as 

90
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:24,964
mountains man's hap could have collapsed
after the last atomic test in which the 

91
00:05:27,770 --> 00:05:28,603
thermonuclear bomb of 250 kilos tons 
with designated by North Korea and this 

92
00:05:32,231 --> 00:05:34,770
area on September the third 2017

93
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,453
yeah,

94
00:05:42,190 --> 00:05:45,070
explosion was so strong that it calls 
the 6.3

95
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,570
magnitude earthquake.
Well,

96
00:05:46,571 --> 00:05:47,404
the collapse,
it seems to have been confirmed and it 

97
00:05:48,461 --> 00:05:52,460
isn't clear whether the center is 
operational a lot based

98
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,293
on the severity of the initial blast,
the post test tremors and the extent of 

99
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:58,364
observable surface disturbances,
we have to assume that there must have 

100
00:06:01,371 --> 00:06:05,470
been substantial damage to the existing 
tunnel network under mount man tap,

101
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,640
Frank v,
pay Bian and Jack Lew.

102
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:10,480
If it isn't operational or if it's too 
badly damaged,

103
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:11,343
it could take some time for the regime 
to rebuild it enough to be able to hold 

104
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:17,080
new tests in a safe manner.
This could have definitely been a factor

105
00:06:17,081 --> 00:06:19,480
that could have altered the deadlines,
but it doesn't seem like this could have

106
00:06:19,481 --> 00:06:21,310
been the main cause for the change of 
discourse

107
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:29,750
economy's stupid.

108
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:33,473
Another hypothesis has to do with the 
effects of international sanctions on 

109
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:37,830
the North Korean economy.
As you all know,

110
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:40,530
North Korea is a very,
very poor country.

111
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,400
You see,
for years,

112
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:45,030
a large part of the international 
community has imposed sanctions on North

113
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,860
Korea,
but these have generally not effective.

114
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:48,840
The country's main partners,
China,

115
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,430
Russia,
and Vietnam.

116
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,763
However,
all of this began to change with the 

117
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:54,714
sanctions that the United Nations began 
imposing on North Korea in 2017 in 

118
00:06:58,201 --> 00:07:01,050
response to its continued nuclear tests 
for the first time,

119
00:07:01,051 --> 00:07:01,884
these sanctions were greatly fulfilled 
by China and that was a very hard blow 

120
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:06,923
to North Korea.
The vast majority of North Korean trade 

121
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:11,880
happens with China.
If that's cut well,

122
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:14,310
Pyongyang has a very serious

123
00:07:14,350 --> 00:07:15,183
problem

124
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,460
multiplied when in September after the 
last them a nuclear test,

125
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:22,470
the United Nations Security Council 
bands,

126
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:25,320
all of North Korea's key exports 
including coal,

127
00:07:25,370 --> 00:07:26,910
iron and textiles.

128
00:07:27,010 --> 00:07:27,843
This resolution is the single largest 
economic sanctions package ever leveled 

129
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:33,543
against the North Korean regime.
The price the North Korean leadership 

130
00:07:36,521 --> 00:07:37,354
will pay for its continued nuclear and 
missile development will be the loss of 

131
00:07:40,631 --> 00:07:43,990
one third of its exports and hard 
currency.

132
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:44,923
An old lady that was in December,
the same body agreed to limit their 

133
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:50,040
refined oil imports do half a million 
barrels per year,

134
00:07:50,070 --> 00:07:54,900
a 90% reduction compared to the amount 
of refined oil North Korea had purchased

135
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:57,240
over the previous year.
And what was the result of all of this?

136
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,103
Well,
several factories had to close due to a 

137
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:00,474
lack of raw materials and the army due 
to a lack of gasoline had to resort to 

138
00:08:03,511 --> 00:08:05,600
coal engines.
And even oxcarts.

139
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:07,873
And although it may surprise you,
this situation doesn't only accentuate 

140
00:08:11,311 --> 00:08:12,144
North Korea's weaknesses,
but it also is a hard blow to Kim Jong 

141
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:15,923
Un's governments making economic 
development's a big priority as of 

142
00:08:18,661 --> 00:08:19,494
course these sanctions are also 
affecting the level of life the elite 

143
00:08:21,931 --> 00:08:23,970
sends the incipient middle class.
Enjoy.

144
00:08:25,740 --> 00:08:26,840
Well,
hold on a moment.

145
00:08:26,841 --> 00:08:28,980
So an emerging middle class in North 
Korea.

146
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,300
Well yeah,
you had it right.

147
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,620
In fact,
here's a question for you.

148
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:32,483
Do you think they've,
a capitalist market can be developing 

149
00:08:34,111 --> 00:08:36,000
within present day North Korea?
Well,

150
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:39,210
stay tuned for an upcoming video that we
have on that.

151
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,950
Even though all of this is important and
to certainly influenced the situation,

152
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:46,740
it doesn't sound like something that 
could put the regime at risk,

153
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:49,610
at least not for the moment.
You

154
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,443
think the North Koreans would revolt 
where the regime would collapse because 

155
00:08:53,451 --> 00:08:54,920
of sanctions.
You don't know anything.

156
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,800
The North Koreans user,
people who survived the famine by eating

157
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,663
wheat came mission.
A North Korean defector who works for 

158
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,350
South Korea's Essential Bank of Korea.

159
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:08,110
So then why is Pyongyang changed its 
discourse so much?

160
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:11,080
Barb has it really just actually 
changed.

161
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:29,230
North Korea is a nuclear power that is 
simply a fax.

162
00:09:29,231 --> 00:09:30,064
If according to American intelligence,
this country currently could have 

163
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:35,590
between 20 and 60 warheads ready for use
stan.

164
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:38,600
Otherwise Pyongyang has already achieved
it's great goal.

165
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:39,453
It has its insurance,
it has the best deterrent that has ever 

166
00:09:42,651 --> 00:09:47,651
been built.
Now,

167
00:09:49,521 --> 00:09:52,100
it is true that in the last April 27th 
into Korea,

168
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:55,250
some is North Korea promise to 
denuclearize the peninsula,

169
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:58,610
but Paul's on a moment because that 
doesn't mean it's willing to give up its

170
00:09:58,611 --> 00:09:59,444
nuclear weapons first because North 
Korea has already promised many things 

171
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:03,920
that they did and do.
For example,

172
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,400
the negotiations and agreements of 1991 
1990 40,000

173
00:10:07,401 --> 00:10:12,401
2007 2012 north grand promises not 
exactly something new and so far they've

174
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:18,070
always been rather flimsy.
You see,

175
00:10:20,021 --> 00:10:20,854
in 1994 Kim Jong UN's father Kim Jong Il
even went so far as to started 

176
00:10:24,350 --> 00:10:25,183
dismantling the nuclear program,
allowing international inspectors to 

177
00:10:27,691 --> 00:10:28,524
visit the country to verify the process.
This was all in exchange for some 

178
00:10:31,291 --> 00:10:33,480
generous health in the United States.
However,

179
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:36,420
years later the world found out that it 
had been a scam.

180
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:39,210
The program had continued to developing 
clandestinely.

181
00:10:39,211 --> 00:10:40,044
Yeah.

182
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:43,123
In 2000 South Korean President Kim Die 
Junge announced that a new day would 

183
00:10:46,371 --> 00:10:47,204
come after returning from his visit with
Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang in 2007 South 

184
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:56,090
Korean President Romeo Horn stated 
during his visit to North Korea,

185
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:59,220
Kim Jong Il has shown a will to restore 
people.

186
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,253
And the second reason we can't assume 
North Korea will give up its nuclear 

187
00:11:06,361 --> 00:11:07,194
weapons is that we may not be on the 
same page about what constitutes 

188
00:11:09,361 --> 00:11:12,390
denuclearization allow me to explain for
beyond Yang.

189
00:11:12,391 --> 00:11:14,910
This time has got a lot to do,
not only with its nuclear weapons,

190
00:11:14,911 --> 00:11:18,450
but also with the u s military is 
capabilities in the peninsula and in the

191
00:11:18,451 --> 00:11:19,680
region.
And in any case,

192
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,573
the truth is that it seems very 
difficult for Kim Jong Un to be willing 

193
00:11:22,801 --> 00:11:24,840
to part with his best life insurance.

194
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:29,230
We must remember,
North Korea is still North Korea.

195
00:11:29,260 --> 00:11:32,800
Kim is still at the same person he was 
when he purged potential rivals,

196
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:35,860
imprisoned thousands of his people and 
had his relatives killed.

197
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:39,250
This was a hopeful moment,
but extreme caution as well.

198
00:11:39,251 --> 00:11:40,084
Warranted Abraham Denmark,
director of the Asian program at the 

199
00:11:42,611 --> 00:11:43,444
Woodrow Wilson Center and former US 
assistant secretary of defense for East 

200
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:47,220
Asia.

201
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:49,400
In fact,
this is something that intercepted North

202
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,233
Korea.
Communications have definitely shown 

203
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:55,210
everything seems to be part of some kind
of roadmap.

204
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:57,250
First,
ensure the survival of the regime,

205
00:11:57,251 --> 00:11:58,084
something he has achieved with its 
nuclear arsenal and seconds negotiate 

206
00:12:01,181 --> 00:12:05,060
with the international community to ends
the sanctions to launch a reform program

207
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:07,630
that can attract investment from China 
and South Korea.

208
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,603
Yeah,

209
00:12:12,210 --> 00:12:13,043
that means although far from how things 
might seem at first to Pyongyang could 

210
00:12:16,200 --> 00:12:20,280
simply be following our well outlines 
plan was the insecurity or some summit,

211
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,203
a big marketing exercise.
Then this in a way explains why South 

212
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:24,953
Koreans,
it's so skeptical of the North's 

213
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:28,050
promises.
I mean just check out this survey,

214
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,153
but now well it's your turn.
Do you think North Korea will actually 

215
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,124
give up its nuclear program?
