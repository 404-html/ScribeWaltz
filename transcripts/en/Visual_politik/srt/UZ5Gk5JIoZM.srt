1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:01,690
Yeah,

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:07,673
we have to be clear.
The world has never been better than it 

3
00:00:10,001 --> 00:00:13,060
is right now.
Thanks mostly to globalization.

4
00:00:13,061 --> 00:00:13,894
There are less and less wars.
Global poverty is falling markedly and 

5
00:00:17,011 --> 00:00:18,910
it's quality of life is generally 
improved,

6
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:25,240
is obviously not happening in a uniform 
way across all countries.

7
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,400
Burdened globally,
everything is improving.

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:28,263
Many western countries have decided to 
rebel and refuse openness as well as 

9
00:00:32,021 --> 00:00:34,540
understanding among the nations in 
Europe,

10
00:00:34,541 --> 00:00:35,374
for example,
far right parties are spreading 

11
00:00:36,791 --> 00:00:38,920
uncertainty.
This is Le Pen in France.

12
00:00:38,921 --> 00:00:41,650
There's violence is in the Netherlands 
as hoffer in Austria.

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:42,750
Yeah.

14
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:45,823
These are all good examples of a new 
wave of politics that is also affecting 

15
00:00:48,561 --> 00:00:50,330
countries like Finland,
Denmark,

16
00:00:50,331 --> 00:00:51,530
Germany,
and Hungary,

17
00:00:51,531 --> 00:00:52,610
among others.
Further,

18
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:56,180
it is also partly responsible for the 
brexit victory in the United States.

19
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:03,973
It is a movement that is taking 
advantage of fear despite the fact that 

20
00:01:07,041 --> 00:01:10,130
we are living in societies that are 
becoming safer and safer.

21
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:11,163
As you well know,
these ideas are not something that is 

22
00:01:12,621 --> 00:01:13,454
exclusive to Europe.
Donald Trump won the US election and he 

23
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,694
has spoken about his views which are 
clearly contrary to globalization and 

24
00:01:20,121 --> 00:01:21,440
immigration.
At this point,

25
00:01:21,441 --> 00:01:22,274
the best question we can ask is,
are there any developed countries left 

26
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:29,840
that still believe in open borders and 
the globalization?

27
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,000
Well,
the answer to that question is yes,

28
00:01:32,001 --> 00:01:32,834
there are,
and then the video today we're going to 

29
00:01:34,251 --> 00:01:37,730
be looking at one of the most 
significance of those countries.

30
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:42,930
Cannabis openness.
Yeah.

31
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:46,920
Two Thousand and 16 alone.
Canada admitted to its country more than

32
00:01:46,921 --> 00:01:49,340
300,000
immigrants.

33
00:01:49,610 --> 00:01:53,100
It's close to one percent of Canada's 
total population.

34
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:53,993
Further,
this is a greater proportion than any 

35
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:58,620
other developed country and do note here
that this is nothing new.

36
00:01:58,621 --> 00:02:00,940
This is something that's been going on 
for two decades,

37
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:02,910
is a result of this,
is that today,

38
00:02:02,911 --> 00:02:06,000
one in every five Canadians was born 
abroad.

39
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:10,110
This is a percentage that is almost 
double that of the US and the UK.

40
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:15,053
Yeah.

41
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:16,010
Took.
The matter is,

42
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:19,520
is that this hasn't led to any sort of 
national tragedy.

43
00:02:19,521 --> 00:02:21,000
In fact,
quite the opposite,

44
00:02:21,050 --> 00:02:21,883
and Canadians well notice according to 
the prestigious and Veronica's 

45
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:25,774
institute's most citizens,
almost 80 percent of them consider 

46
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:29,414
immigration.
To be good for the economy and think 

47
00:02:31,091 --> 00:02:31,924
that it is one of the best ways to deal 
with some of the issues facing Canada 

48
00:02:34,940 --> 00:02:35,900
such as its aging.

49
00:02:44,270 --> 00:02:44,450
If

50
00:02:44,450 --> 00:02:47,150
you really think about it,
it does make sense.

51
00:02:47,210 --> 00:02:49,670
Employment is the country's most 
productive assets,

52
00:02:49,700 --> 00:02:53,660
so why would they want to prevent it 
from growing in the context of a dynamic

53
00:02:53,661 --> 00:02:54,494
economy?
What's the harm of immigrants who are 

54
00:02:55,611 --> 00:02:56,444
willing to work?
We're willing to set up companies and 

55
00:02:58,041 --> 00:03:00,400
once you get an education,
it is something that we have.

56
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:02,680
Visual politic thing is actually pretty 
good.

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:11,840
First Year in 2015 just introduced 
became Canada's prime minister.

58
00:03:12,810 --> 00:03:16,410
He defeated against all odds.
The conservative at Stephen Harper.

59
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:18,840
Harper had held the office for almost 10
years.

60
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,703
Since then,
the political agenda has been dominated 

61
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:25,920
by a determination to deepen the 
country's pro globalization policies.

62
00:03:25,921 --> 00:03:27,630
Trudeau himself,
a left winger,

63
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,200
has been quite an advocate of promoting 
free trade and social mobility.

64
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,093
In his first year,
he signed a free trade agreement with 

65
00:03:33,781 --> 00:03:37,380
the European Union and confirmed 
Canada's adherence to the TPP.

66
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:40,680
Although trump's first action in office 
was to destroy the TPP,

67
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,563
was going to be the biggest commercial 
agreements in history in just the year 

68
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:48,510
Canada has built up free trade 
agreements with nearly 60 percent of the

69
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:51,450
global economy.
Further Trudeau wants to expand this and

70
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:55,500
increased trade with China.
We've agreed to launch exploratory talks

71
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,820
towards a potential free trade agreement
between Canada and China.

72
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,420
As the government is doing more of the 
same concerning immigration,

73
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:04,283
they've even set the goal of increasing 
the number of immigrants they get 50 

74
00:04:07,081 --> 00:04:07,914
percent every single year for my refugee
fleeing Somalia to becoming a member of 

75
00:04:11,941 --> 00:04:12,774
parliament in Canada.
I've met as once again a med history 

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,233
this week after it was named Canada's 
Minister of Immigration by Prime 

77
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:21,930
Minister Justin Trudeau in a major 
cabinet reshuffle.

78
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:22,913
Given these principles,
it probably shouldn't surprise you to 

79
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:25,194
learn that Canada is one of the 
countries that are most committed to 

80
00:04:26,881 --> 00:04:31,500
receiving Syrian refugees.
Canada has received more than 33,000

81
00:04:31,501 --> 00:04:34,980
Syrian refugees since Trudeau took 
office in his first year.

82
00:04:34,981 --> 00:04:38,790
Trudeau himself went to Toronto's 
airport to welcome the refugees into the

83
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:39,624
country

84
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,973
migration policy.
Let's hold on a second because 

85
00:04:49,771 --> 00:04:52,290
immigration to Canada isn't totally 
free,

86
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,480
in fact,
it's not as free as we're visual politic

87
00:04:54,481 --> 00:04:55,314
would like,
but what's really important here is not 

88
00:04:56,761 --> 00:05:00,090
whether or whether there are not 
excessive administrative difficulties,

89
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,933
so rather than citizens shouldn't 
automatically view those who are 

90
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:05,700
immigrating into the country as 
criminals,

91
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,090
and this is precisely why Canada is so 
successful,

92
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,720
they are a country that takes pride in 
looking for additional citizens.

93
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,260
They are not looking for temporary 
immigrants since 1967.

94
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:19,530
Immigration to Canada has been based on 
a points system.

95
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:23,400
This system considers qualifications,
experience professional skills,

96
00:05:23,401 --> 00:05:26,310
and the knowledge of either French or 
English in the same way.

97
00:05:26,311 --> 00:05:30,360
The system also gives priority to those 
who are needed by Canada's companies.

98
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:31,223
Canada will lift the Mexican visa 
requirement that has restricted travel 

99
00:05:35,281 --> 00:05:36,114
to Canada.
This move will make it easier for our 

100
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:38,694
Mexican friends to visit Canada wild 
growing our local economies and 

101
00:05:42,571 --> 00:05:43,404
strengthening our communities.
The tendency seems to be to make these 

102
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,214
procedures easier,
but what is really important is the 

103
00:05:49,621 --> 00:05:53,670
social recognition and the integration 
of immigrants into the country.

104
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:54,563
The Canadian bill of rights itself 
recognizes the concept of multicultural 

105
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,633
patrimony.
There are solid policies to encourage 

106
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:01,700
integration,
which by the way,

107
00:06:01,701 --> 00:06:05,630
don't focus on stripping the immigrants 
of their original cultural identity,

108
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,880
but rather see that as an enriching

109
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,293
snowball in Canadian schools.
It is easy to find classes that are 

110
00:06:17,361 --> 00:06:21,710
taught in Spanish or Ukrainian and the 
results support these policies.

111
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:25,280
In deed in the last decade,
Canada's growth has been bigger than the

112
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:26,480
US,
the UK,

113
00:06:26,481 --> 00:06:30,200
and Germany and its citizens in dry,
a very high standard of living.

114
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
Now.
Hopefully it might be more clear as to 

115
00:06:32,001 --> 00:06:34,700
why Canada's immigration website 
collapsed after trump's.

116
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:34,840
Yeah,

117
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,673
victory.

118
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,873
I understand why the economists has also
had cover pages highlighting Canada's 

119
00:06:41,911 --> 00:06:42,744
no,

120
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,310
no.

121
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:49,420
Of course,
the Canadian model is not perfect boss.

122
00:06:49,470 --> 00:06:53,100
Compared to the new nationalist and 
populist tendencies of other countries,

123
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:57,600
Canada has shown what a desirable 
alternative openness can really be.

124
00:06:57,690 --> 00:06:58,523
The key takeaway that we hope this video
really puts across is to try and make 

125
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:02,214
things better in your country rather 
than isolated from the rest of the 

126
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:06,520
world.
The latter of which is an argument.

127
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:08,790
There's many politicians like trump are 
defending,

128
00:07:08,820 --> 00:07:09,653
well,
this isn't our opinion here at visual 

129
00:07:10,351 --> 00:07:13,050
politic and now we would love to know 
yours.

130
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:16,170
Do you think immigration causes as many 
problems as people claim?

131
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:19,830
Would you like to live in a culturally 
diverse country like Canada?
