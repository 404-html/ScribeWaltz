1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,520
So have you guys have requested faster,
make a video about France now Francis,

2
00:00:11,521 --> 00:00:13,740
one of the wealthiest countries in the 
welds.

3
00:00:13,741 --> 00:00:15,540
Yes.
One with some of the artists,

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:16,374
economic problems today.
France is the second largest economic 

5
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:23,400
power in the European Union bus that 
might not last for much longer.

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:27,840
They youth unemployment rate is over 23 
percent in their public debt is twice as

7
00:00:27,841 --> 00:00:32,841
big as that entire GDP.
Ten years ago,

8
00:00:34,061 --> 00:00:38,470
the entire world was buying Renno cars 
or Alcatel mobile phones,

9
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:39,483
but today French experts of almonds are 
half of what they used to be just a 

10
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:43,444
short time ago.
Their companies are simply unable to 

11
00:00:45,191 --> 00:00:47,080
face the competition that's coming from 
China,

12
00:00:47,081 --> 00:00:48,130
from South Korea,
rob,

13
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,160
even from the United States in general.
And as you can imagine,

14
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,970
this economic crisis has had a great 
effect on French society.

15
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,863
If you don't believe me,
let's just have a look at the 

16
00:01:02,841 --> 00:01:06,460
presidential elections of this year.
That's 2017.

17
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,743
None of the candidates from the 
traditional parties have made it to the 

18
00:01:09,851 --> 00:01:10,684
second rounds.
French voters are simply fed up with 

19
00:01:12,821 --> 00:01:13,654
their political establishment,
and this is why they've chosen a 

20
00:01:15,971 --> 00:01:18,720
politician who wants to make a one 80 
shift in the French

21
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,643
system.

22
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,313
You might be wondering what are the 
reasons behind this French crisis and 

23
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:29,240
more importantly,
what is macron propose in order to solve

24
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,220
it all today,
we're going to answer that question,

25
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,110
but before we get started,
as usual,

26
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:34,340
let's take a look at the history,

27
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:38,220
right

28
00:01:38,830 --> 00:01:41,550
is to the French people.
Right after World War Two,

29
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,080
all the European powers were on the 
verge of bankruptcy men.

30
00:01:45,081 --> 00:01:45,914
This included France,
half the country was destroyed by 

31
00:01:48,220 --> 00:01:51,340
bombing and this included houses as well
as factories.

32
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,233
Luckily enough though,
Uncle Sam was there and then he was 

33
00:01:54,131 --> 00:01:54,520
ready to

34
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:57,640
hell no

35
00:01:59,010 --> 00:01:59,843
states was interested in having a strong
Europe say that the consonants could 

36
00:02:02,311 --> 00:02:04,410
purchase goods from them.
This lead duty,

37
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:06,840
so called Marshall Plan being put into 
place.

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:10,020
It was a cash injection of billions of 
dollars,

39
00:02:10,021 --> 00:02:13,170
which would lead to the reconstruction 
of the European nations,

40
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:14,103
but do hold on just a minute because 
each of these countries use the finance 

41
00:02:16,741 --> 00:02:18,360
in very different ways.
For instance,

42
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:22,770
the German government created that 
political theory called auto liberalism,

43
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:23,643
a gay social liberalism.
This was a combination of social 

44
00:02:26,221 --> 00:02:29,010
programs and free enterprise.
In other words,

45
00:02:29,070 --> 00:02:32,850
the government would provide a safety 
net for their citizens and subsidize the

46
00:02:32,851 --> 00:02:35,520
companies as well,
but on the other hand is these companies

47
00:02:35,521 --> 00:02:37,680
were privates as they could compete with
them.

48
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,680
A very,
very different case.

49
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:44,543
Back then,
the president was general Charles de 

50
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:48,300
Gaulle,
and he was no friend of free enterprise,

51
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:52,170
so his political theory,
Deer Ridge Ism was pretty different from

52
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:53,004
that of the gym.

53
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,360
His cabinet

54
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,193
is not giving proposals,
but to give so used all of this money 

55
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:04,570
from the United States do nationalize 
the big corporations,

56
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,490
steel factories,
electric companies,

57
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:07,324
phone companies,
even the car making them off like Renno 

58
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,803
and citron.
They all had the government as their 

59
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:14,590
biggest shareholder,
but not only that,

60
00:03:14,591 --> 00:03:15,424
they also created a deregister system on
society where the state would play a 

61
00:03:18,731 --> 00:03:19,564
major role in all areas,
including conditions for hiring workers 

62
00:03:22,421 --> 00:03:25,810
as well as the minimum wage.
This is a really important point because

63
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,690
not all welfare states that created the 
same in Germany.

64
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,524
There was no minimum wage and there was 
a bigger space for trade unions and 

65
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:34,210
companies do negotiate contract 
conditions.

66
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:35,243
Further,
healthcare was provided by private 

67
00:03:36,311 --> 00:03:37,144
insurance and regional governments has a
lot to say when it came to the laws and 

68
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:41,290
regulations.
Nevertheless,

69
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:44,110
in France,
all of the social policies came from the

70
00:03:44,111 --> 00:03:46,120
central authority,
in other words,

71
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,700
to go represents kind of the opposite of
what we like era,

72
00:03:48,701 --> 00:03:49,130
visual,

73
00:03:49,130 --> 00:03:49,963
holistic,

74
00:03:54,170 --> 00:03:57,350
but despite all of that,
during these first few years after World

75
00:03:57,350 --> 00:04:01,460
War Two from center to these so called 
glorious 30 for three decades,

76
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:02,294
the average wage triples and those 
companies sponsored by the governments 

77
00:04:05,210 --> 00:04:06,290
became a global leader.

78
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:13,313
Give some context.
This was way before American companies 

79
00:04:15,511 --> 00:04:19,320
started moving their factories to China.
Renu initial inward opening factories in

80
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:22,440
Spain where salaries were much lower,
but let's be honest,

81
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,333
during that time,
every European country was growing at 

82
00:04:25,351 --> 00:04:27,080
the same rate.
Just think about it.

83
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:27,953
We're talking about the 19 sixties.
That was not the economic powerhouse 

84
00:04:30,871 --> 00:04:31,704
that it is today.
Latin America was full of dictatorships 

85
00:04:33,931 --> 00:04:34,764
of all kinds,
and the Soviet Union was simply unable 

86
00:04:36,691 --> 00:04:40,140
to produce high enough quality goods to 
be sold in the international market.

87
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:41,303
Nonetheless,
France had unimportant industrial 

88
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:45,570
tradition.
They've had a well educated society,

89
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,930
and overall it had good rule of law and 
stable political system

90
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,853
companies.

91
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:56,560
Not only that,
in 1958,

92
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:59,410
so those countries already rebuilds by 
the Marshall Plan,

93
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:00,393
decided to create a free trade union 
which would eventually become the 

94
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:04,921
European Union.
At this time,

95
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:07,750
if France had the largest population of 
these countries,

96
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,250
and I don't forget the back in that 
time,

97
00:05:09,251 --> 00:05:13,360
Germany was still divided into two hops.
All of this meant that France was in the

98
00:05:13,361 --> 00:05:16,590
strongest position.
Do you negotiate that entry conditions?

99
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:18,160
And as I said before,
Charles,

100
00:05:18,161 --> 00:05:18,994
the goal was no fan of free trade.
He used his negotiating how to make 

101
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:25,630
France the dominant country in certain 
industries such as aggregate

102
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:26,563
culture,

103
00:05:28,890 --> 00:05:29,900
Europe,
Europe,

104
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,033
Europe.
It doesn't help anything nor means 

105
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:33,984
anything.
So if you are watching this video from 

106
00:05:35,401 --> 00:05:36,234
anywhere in Europe,
you might have heard about the common 

107
00:05:37,771 --> 00:05:38,604
agricultural policy.
This is a policy created to keep 

108
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,553
European consumers from buying 
agricultural goods from the developing 

109
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:45,630
world,
but not only that,

110
00:05:45,631 --> 00:05:50,010
it also imposes production quotas inside
of the European economic area.

111
00:05:50,130 --> 00:05:50,963
This means Polish or Spanish.
Farmers cannot sell enough that they 

112
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,534
want to sell.
There is a maximum quota imposed by 

113
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:58,790
Brussels and you can probably guess 
that,

114
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:00,830
Oh yes,
this was a French invention.

115
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,650
It helps explain things like,

116
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:03,643
yes,

117
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,540
price value of 70 point 4 billion euros 
in 2011.

118
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:11,600
French agricultural production is the 
leader in Europe.

119
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:16,323
The goal held power for decades and the 
following French presidents kept this 

120
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:22,540
dirigiste model at the end of the day,
during the 19 sixties and seventies,

121
00:06:22,541 --> 00:06:25,390
France was on fire,
so if something works,

122
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,830
why would you fix it?
Oh,

123
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:30,130
well actually now I'm going to tell you 
exactly why you should fix it,

124
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,210
st

125
00:06:33,090 --> 00:06:33,923
to a different problem.
The problem starts when the rest of the 

126
00:06:36,251 --> 00:06:38,410
world is running faster than you were.
Of course.

127
00:06:38,411 --> 00:06:41,230
Talking about the eighties and nineties,
the Berlin Wall came down.

128
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:45,580
China started opening up their economy 
and lots of new countries like Spain and

129
00:06:45,581 --> 00:06:47,520
Greece became members of the European.
Yeah,

130
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:48,443
union,

131
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:52,510
and of course all of these countries 
wanted to sell their products.

132
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:55,300
In other words,
all of the sudden France had rifles,

133
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:58,870
and this is what explains why this kind 
of news is quite so common,

134
00:06:59,080 --> 00:06:59,913
furious French farmers who have been 
attacking Spanish fruit and vegetable 

135
00:07:02,840 --> 00:07:05,530
deliveries has affects of the e coli 
crisis,

136
00:07:05,531 --> 00:07:06,364
continue to bite Spanish producers of 
slash their prices to make up for huge 

137
00:07:10,511 --> 00:07:15,190
losses and now up to forty cents a kilo 
cheaper than their French counterparts.

138
00:07:15,910 --> 00:07:16,743
The same happens with other industries.
Take a look at this chart that 

139
00:07:19,151 --> 00:07:24,151
represents the trade balance in France.
Pay Attention.

140
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:29,480
You can see how often the nineties 
exports on dropping slowly.

141
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,200
This trend is especially true after the 
financial crisis,

142
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:36,640
so maybe you under the Alcatel mobile 
phones,

143
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,503
these were mobile phones that were 
really popular when mobile phones were 

144
00:07:39,821 --> 00:07:40,654
just becoming a thing.
Alcatel was an absolute juggernaut in 

145
00:07:43,961 --> 00:07:44,794
this area and now they've said 
disappeared in a market dominated by 

146
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:52,940
American Chinese and South Korean 
companies,

147
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,180
and this is just one example of how 
France is losing their ability to

148
00:07:57,410 --> 00:07:58,243
innovative.

149
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,573
Now you might be wondering what of all 
the French government's done to tackle 

150
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,300
this problem?
Well,

151
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:08,150
really they just protected the companies
from the rest of the welds.

152
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,920
For an opposite example,
let's have a look at Sweden.

153
00:08:09,921 --> 00:08:13,340
He makes Volvo cars where the Chinese 
company wanted to buy this from.

154
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:16,730
The Swedish government didn't intervene 
at all in Sweden.

155
00:08:16,731 --> 00:08:20,150
There was a clear separation between 
business and the state,

156
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:23,980
but we cannot say the same of France.
Just have a look at what happens when it

157
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:26,400
Pepsi wanted to buy the new moon in 2000
and

158
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,333
fine

159
00:08:29,270 --> 00:08:30,103
barlow.
The labor minister said the government 

160
00:08:32,091 --> 00:08:35,840
will do all we can to oppose a bid and 
Terry Britain,

161
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:39,110
the finance minister,
pledge to protect Donald,

162
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:41,270
but this is not the only thing that 
doesn't change.

163
00:08:41,271 --> 00:08:42,104
In France.
They're social spending is still the 

164
00:08:43,611 --> 00:08:44,444
highest in the European Union.
Even larger than that of the Nordic 

165
00:08:47,241 --> 00:08:49,940
countries and further the French 
administration employees,

166
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,783
more civil sevens than any other 
European country and their salaries are 

167
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,603
also pretty enormous.
So basically France has a lower income 

168
00:08:58,741 --> 00:08:59,574
than they had in the past,
but they keep spending like they did 

169
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,364
during the glory days.
This explains why their public debt is 

170
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,874
quite as large as it is,
what things they might just be on the 

171
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:09,510
verge of change.

172
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,180
Crones,
quiet revolution.

173
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,103
Alright,
so politicians do you promise a lot 

174
00:09:16,461 --> 00:09:19,940
during elections and they don't do 
always deliver on those promises,

175
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:23,400
but there is something we have to admit.
In the case of Kronk,

176
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:26,770
his program is a complete break with the
French dirigisme.

177
00:09:26,870 --> 00:09:28,910
All the political analysts have labeled 
this man,

178
00:09:28,911 --> 00:09:29,744
is it motor a politician?
He wants to continue the work of his 

179
00:09:31,611 --> 00:09:33,980
predecessors,
but the big question is,

180
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:37,130
is that really true?
The truth is that some of his proposals,

181
00:09:37,131 --> 00:09:37,964
they've never even been put forward by 
another French presidents from any side 

182
00:09:41,091 --> 00:09:41,924
of the political spectrum is precisely a
big reform program to open up a series 

183
00:09:46,971 --> 00:09:51,971
of services and increased competition in
terms of products.

184
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:52,844
And good markets,
transportation on some for the better 

185
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:56,844
understanding in an electoral campaign 
that became famous because of the 

186
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:00,053
populous tone of Mrs [inaudible],
Mr Macron is proposing to retire over 

187
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:03,834
120,000 civil sevens know many of you 
might think that this is a pretty 

188
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:08,364
horrible idea,
but there is something we must admit 

189
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,103
he's being on it.

190
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:13,513
Yes.

191
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,340
No,
the politician who would suggest such an

192
00:10:17,341 --> 00:10:19,950
unpopular thing during an election.
Nonetheless,

193
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:20,813
macron has won this election by often 
doing the opposite of what a candidate 

194
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:26,580
should supposedly do.
On his manifesto,

195
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:30,060
he promised that he would never reduce 
the return and sage and other words,

196
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:33,010
macron is really committed to reducing 
French publix

197
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,640
ending

198
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:39,870
on the other hands.
Macron combines all of these budget cuts

199
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:43,100
with lowering taxes and helping small 
companies in his own words.

200
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:43,963
Macron wants to substitute the French 
dirigisme with something closer to the 

201
00:10:46,471 --> 00:10:47,304
model of Germany or Sweden where welfare
states coexist with the free market 

202
00:10:50,791 --> 00:10:52,650
economy.
So now you might be wondering,

203
00:10:52,651 --> 00:10:53,484
even after winning the elections,
does he have any actual power to make 

204
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,700
this happen?
In France?

205
00:10:56,701 --> 00:11:00,420
The president doesn't have as much power
as the American president sends.

206
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:01,283
Every lawyer wants to pass,
has to go through parliaments and now 

207
00:11:03,991 --> 00:11:07,870
the question has to be who is the 
biggest force in parliaments weld.

208
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:11,700
That is something we're not going to 
know until the summer of 2017 in June.

209
00:11:11,701 --> 00:11:12,534
French people are going to go back to 
the voting stations and this time 

210
00:11:14,821 --> 00:11:15,654
they're voting and legislative elections
and it is here that the party of Marine 

211
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:20,010
Le Pen,
the national front,

212
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,140
has a better chance of becoming the main
four.

213
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:28,120
What does the French for our rights 
actually want?

214
00:11:28,210 --> 00:11:29,620
Well,
if you'd like to know more about that,

215
00:11:29,621 --> 00:11:31,810
you should definitely check out one of 
our previous videos,

216

which you can click on,
right?

217
00:11:33,330 --> 00:11:34,163
Yeah.

218
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:38,213
And now the question is,
do you really believe in this quiet 

219
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:40,794
revolution of Emmanuel Macron?
Do you believe that he can pull from 

220
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:43,973
sound of the whole?
Do you think French stagnation has a 

221
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,704
solution?
Well,
