1
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:05,940
Democracy,
it's a tricky concept now.

2
00:00:05,941 --> 00:00:08,100
Yes,
we all agree that people must have a say

3
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:08,934
on governmental decisions,
but on the other hands were kind of 

4
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:12,294
scared to see what happens when the 
citizens are manipulated by a populist 

5
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:16,314
politician.
This is why direct democracy and 

6
00:00:18,961 --> 00:00:23,961
referendums are quite so controversial.
In theory it seems like a great idea,

7
00:00:28,891 --> 00:00:33,210
so I'll ask the voters directionally 
about the very laws that affect them,

8
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:37,230
but what happens when we actually put 
something like this into practice?

9
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:38,073
Yes.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,993
Well,
occasionally you do get a rather nasty 

11
00:00:43,621 --> 00:00:45,570
surprise,
but not always.

12
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:46,493
Indeed,
there is one country that needed direct 

13
00:00:48,451 --> 00:00:51,840
democracy,
a cornerstone of that political system,

14
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:53,760
no war.
Despite what you might think.

15
00:00:53,761 --> 00:00:54,594
We are not talking about Switzerland 
here this time we're talking about 

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,030
liquidity

17
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,863
shine.

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:07,620
All right.
All right.

19
00:01:07,660 --> 00:01:08,411
I know.
I know.

20
00:01:08,411 --> 00:01:09,244
I mean,
why should you care about such a small 

21
00:01:11,261 --> 00:01:12,270
country?
Well,

22
00:01:12,340 --> 00:01:13,430
look,
Lichtenstein,

23
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:16,750
it has a population of less than 38,000
inhabitants,

24
00:01:16,751 --> 00:01:20,470
but despite their size,
their political system is one of a kind.

25
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,393
Despite being a constitutional monarchy,
most of the political decisions in this 

26
00:01:25,001 --> 00:01:29,630
principality done through referendums.
This includes economic policy.

27
00:01:29,631 --> 00:01:33,160
Social spending and even citizenship,
yes,

28
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:34,023
that is right.
If you wanted to become a lichtenstein 

29
00:01:35,551 --> 00:01:36,384
or your neighbors get to choose whether 
to accept or reject you through a 

30
00:01:39,581 --> 00:01:42,760
popular vote.
Even the right to self determination can

31
00:01:42,761 --> 00:01:43,594
be guaranteed by referendum.
This means that any of the 11 

32
00:01:46,691 --> 00:01:47,524
municipalities in sight of Lichtenstein 
can hold a popular vote to decide 

33
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:51,574
whether they want to stay in the country
or become an independent nation or 

34
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:57,190
sounds pretty crazy,
right?

35
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,233
Well,
it certainly seems to have served 

36
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,050
Lichtenstein incredibly well along with 
Qatar.

37
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:04,930
Lichtenstein is the wealthiest country 
on the planet,

38
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:08,740
at least when it comes to GDP per capita
at purchasing power parity.

39
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,290
This country is also known for its 
political stability.

40
00:02:11,291 --> 00:02:15,340
It's rule of law and its business 
friendly policies and well at this point

41
00:02:15,341 --> 00:02:17,350
in the video you might be beginning to 
wonder,

42
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:19,270
well,
how is all of this possible?

43
00:02:19,271 --> 00:02:20,104
How can you manage the guarantees such a
stable political system when people can 

44
00:02:24,101 --> 00:02:28,090
vote in any crazy law they want simply 
with a referendum?

45
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:28,983
Well,
this is what we were wondering here at 

46
00:02:30,161 --> 00:02:33,670
visual politic to and to figure out the 
answer to this question.

47
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,270
We decided that the best thing was to go
to the country and last,

48
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:38,433
so we did just that.
A Gal is a village with no more than 

49
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:03,994
2000 inhabitants that technically it 
could become an independent sovereign 

50
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:08,074
country if it wanted to,
so we wanted to find out exactly how 

51
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:17,600
that would happen.
So we spoke with the mayor of the town.

52
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:19,320
Great.
Thank you for joining us today.

53
00:03:19,321 --> 00:03:20,154
I appreciate you taking the time to meet
with us and just answer a few a few 

54
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:26,280
questions.
If we could start off,

55
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:27,143
if I could ask,
what is the legal way for the town of 

56
00:03:30,361 --> 00:03:35,361
regale could separate from the country 
of Lichtenstein and how could,

57
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,550
how could regale hold a self 
referendums?

58
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:44,230
Does he facetune Dank part?
It's very does to be focused on.

59
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,130
Then now her very smugly say,
does he say dish?

60
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:59,550
I was making the seat somehow taken say 
punked room.

61
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:02,310
Yeah,
deceased tank,

62
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:07,311
but we had food and survive that Suki 
hertich lunchtime leaking shine.

63
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:13,850
Eastern client owned a escaped came and 
good wound.

64
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,500
To me.
I can type austism for boondoggles,

65
00:04:17,510 --> 00:04:18,343
so shaken

66
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:19,223
and as far as far as I can see here,
we've been in Lichtenstein for a couple 

67
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,810
of days.
The prince is very well respected here,

68
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:25,190
isn't it?

69
00:04:25,190 --> 00:04:26,250
Yeah.
Uh,

70
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,093
the first is to actually any respects 
persona owned via seen doc be counted 

71
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,580
toward Houston House just recently in 
Lichtenstein.

72
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:42,680
Andrea Dane can the first tower we see 
owning his students.

73
00:04:42,681 --> 00:04:46,020
A start over helped me to see Owen.
And when does he start?

74
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,190
Sean oft to go to get common,
some beige.

75
00:04:49,191 --> 00:04:54,191
Bill Boehm to bay St Louis,
the OPS team for the rights to give food

76
00:04:56,810 --> 00:05:01,810
to at rallies rights,
wilted on neat by threaten dim on the BS

77
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,460
in Tobago.
Klauber positive.

78
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:10,970
Our we act on the is not nearby.

79
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:15,991
Prince Hans,
Adam.

80
00:05:15,991 --> 00:05:16,824
The second is the wealthiest monique in 
all of Europe with a net worth of more 

81
00:05:19,981 --> 00:05:22,980
than 4 billion American dollars.
But make no mistake here.

82
00:05:22,981 --> 00:05:25,380
His wealth doesn't come from his 
political role,

83
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,333
but instead from his business career,
he is the owner of the lgbt banking 

84
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:30,864
group.
One of the biggest asset management 

85
00:05:32,161 --> 00:05:32,570
firms.

86
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,403
Europe.

87
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:41,710
He inherited the principality in 1989 
and you can say that he is the father of

88
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,650
the direct democracy system here in 
Lichtenstein.

89
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:46,990
In his book the state in the third 
millennium.

90
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,370
He outlined a way to implement this 
system in a larger country and well,

91
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:53,130
this is what we wanted to talk to him

92
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:56,270
about yesterday and Highness.
Thank you once again for being here.

93
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:59,540
I really appreciate taking time to talk 
to us and inviting us to your home.

94
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,710
What,
what do you mean?

95
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:01,983
It's a really broad question,
but what do you mean by the state as a 

96
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:06,110
service provider?

97
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:10,350
I think the state should really 
concentrate on those jobs,

98
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:11,803
uh,
which the state can do better than 

99
00:06:13,021 --> 00:06:18,021
private industry or a better than the 
local communities.

100
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,170
And for me,
it also important when a,

101
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,343
uh,
uh,

102
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,920
proposals,
changes of the,

103
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:27,063
uh,
of the constitution to all also 

104
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:33,580
introduced a right of self determination
at every village in leakage.

105
00:06:33,581 --> 00:06:38,220
Dan Has the right to leave the standard 
principality,

106
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,413
if they think that they get a better 
offer from another country or if they 

107
00:06:43,021 --> 00:06:45,400
can make more money,
uh,

108
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:49,770
or lower taxation or God knows what,
if they become independent.

109
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,880
And that was for me also important,
you know,

110
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,013
also for my successes and for the 
politician to really to deliver very 

111
00:07:01,141 --> 00:07:06,141
good service on low cost and therefore 
low cost with low taxation.

112
00:07:07,870 --> 00:07:08,460
Do you think that

113
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,900
lower cost is driven by competition?
Yeah.

114
00:07:12,901 --> 00:07:13,734
Between the,
my understanding is the local 

115
00:07:16,201 --> 00:07:18,640
governments have of Lichtenstein is,
you know,

116
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:23,040
they have a lot of self determination.
They're also competing with each other.

117
00:07:23,530 --> 00:07:24,480
Is that,
could you,

118
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:26,010
could you tell me a little how that 
works?

119
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,700
Yeah,
the different.

120
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,310
We have 11 villages,
basically a,

121
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:35,860
they compete on,
on,

122
00:07:35,861 --> 00:07:38,710
on taxation.
Uh,

123
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,720
they compete on the way how they offer 
the infrastructure.

124
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:47,753
For instance,
give building sites to some industry 

125
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,073
knows what.
So there is a certain competition 

126
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,530
services or whatever.
So.

127
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,160
So they compete on this issues 
basically.

128
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,153
So if I was a Vichtenstein Ian and I was
living here and I was looking at 11 

129
00:08:07,721 --> 00:08:10,600
different villages,
I feel,

130
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:11,470
you know,
again,

131
00:08:11,471 --> 00:08:12,810
relating to my experience,
you know,

132
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:13,644
I,
I basically have like one country where 

133
00:08:14,441 --> 00:08:16,510
I grew up so I'm always going to relate 
things to the UK.

134
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,880
But I think about it if I,
if I,

135
00:08:17,881 --> 00:08:18,714
I grew up in a village called 
headquarters and if like I guess in the 

136
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:23,200
next village over town or Canterbury or 
whatever,

137
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,470
I get pretty much the same deal is,
it's not going to be any different,

138
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,333
you know,
whether I'm working for someone or 

139
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,110
starting a business or applying to the 
government for a permit to do something,

140
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:32,973
it's always going to be the same.
But here in Lichtenstein fi I can look 

141
00:08:35,621 --> 00:08:38,020
at what the different villages are 
offering and make a decision.

142
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:42,930
So religious said,
oh,

143
00:08:42,931 --> 00:08:46,270
we have now enough manufacturing 
industry all,

144
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:50,550
uh,
also enough foreignness.

145
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:55,580
It was also quite an issue because if 
you attract being the service,

146
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:00,880
the service instead of manufacturing 
industry with it,

147
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:05,640
you attract also workforce also from 
outside.

148
00:09:05,641 --> 00:09:08,220
Because we cannot provide all the 
workforce here.

149
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,950
Not the specialist and so on.
So basically,

150
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:12,860
so there was no resistance.
No,

151
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:17,050
we have to stop and others took up the 
chances and uh,

152
00:09:17,430 --> 00:09:18,263
we're able to attract a manufacturing or
service industries and therefore get 

153
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:28,191
more income for the village and then off
of,

154
00:09:29,250 --> 00:09:30,083
oh,
lower taxation or build a new road or a 

155
00:09:33,601 --> 00:09:38,601
new school or a renovated church or God 
knows whatever ideas they had.

156
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:41,303
This works fantastically here,
but in a country as large as the United 

157
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:45,563
States,
the UK,

158
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:47,280
Spain.
Do you think this,

159
00:09:47,281 --> 00:09:50,200
is that right?
To self sovereignty and that right?

160
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,410
That works so well here in a small 
country.

161
00:09:52,411 --> 00:09:55,800
Do you think they can work in,
in the constitution of,

162
00:09:55,890 --> 00:09:57,570
of a,
of a much larger country?

163
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,570
Yes.
I think,

164
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:03,480
yes,
I've seen it in Switzerland.

165
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:07,050
They have it,
they have this direct democracy,

166
00:10:07,530 --> 00:10:12,530
they have this decentralization 
sometimes depending on the can't on down

167
00:10:12,661 --> 00:10:17,490
to the small villages.
I've seen it to a certain degree also in

168
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,580
United States,
of course they're from state to state.

169
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:23,740
It's a little bit different.
Uh,

170
00:10:24,050 --> 00:10:24,883
but that influenced me very much and 
thought that's basically a good system 

171
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:36,810
and a to give the people some say 
because usually,

172
00:10:36,811 --> 00:10:39,870
especially in a very centralized states,
uh,

173
00:10:39,871 --> 00:10:44,420
as a politician or has a monarch or a 
monitor,

174
00:10:44,530 --> 00:10:45,363
a ga or president or prime minister,
it takes so long until you realize that 

175
00:10:51,421 --> 00:10:56,421
there's a problem and with that problems
pop up and suddenly you'll see,

176
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,800
oh,
I didn't realize that they suddenly have

177
00:11:01,801 --> 00:11:05,430
an initiative being locally being on a 
statewide level.

178
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,120
And then you can solve those problems 
bunch earlier

179
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:13,420
and Lichtenstein for reference about 
40,000

180
00:11:13,421 --> 00:11:15,280
people.
So you go out there,

181
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,114
you can gather these things.
It's interesting because I feel this 

182
00:11:20,530 --> 00:11:25,060
should be something if I can get a 
thousand of my friends together and then

183
00:11:25,061 --> 00:11:27,790
put something forward and then 
parliament have to discuss it.

184
00:11:27,791 --> 00:11:32,260
And if it's quite a smart idea of a 
constitutional change at 1,500

185
00:11:32,261 --> 00:11:33,094
could happen,
which,

186
00:11:33,570 --> 00:11:35,020
you know,
Primo Fasc,

187
00:11:35,230 --> 00:11:38,170
you think this is going to be less 
stable,

188
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:38,800
right?
You know,

189
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,633
the immediate thought that comes into 
the mind because anyone can change this 

190
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:42,814
right away.
But this doesn't happen here and it 

191
00:11:45,191 --> 00:11:47,890
doesn't seem to happen in other places 
that have a similar thing.

192
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:49,473
Why do you think that is?
Because many of those things are on the 

193
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,250
local

194
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,083
basis and you have people who are in 
favor of it against it and so all those 

195
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,390
things are much more discussed within 
the population,

196
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:09,391
within the voting with the voters,
and I think that has turned out to be an

197
00:12:11,051 --> 00:12:13,780
advantage,
edited the stability.

198
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,970
If I look at Switzerland,
for instance,

199
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,043
nevertheless I think that we have even a
vest assist in this was the possibility 

200
00:12:23,561 --> 00:12:25,840
of a veto power,
but the reigning prince,

201
00:12:28,290 --> 00:12:29,123
just to clarify the Swiss system,
they also have a similar system of 

202
00:12:31,471 --> 00:12:35,470
direct democracy,
but obviously in a prince two visa,

203
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:36,323
it's now before continuing with this 
interview where you wanted to get in 

204
00:12:42,871 --> 00:12:45,420
touch with some politicians from 
parliaments.

205
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:46,283
The Flyer list,
the party is the most critical voice 

206
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:50,790
inside of Lichtenstein's political 
system

207
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:57,300
only has bonds actually used just sweet 
to power.

208
00:12:57,301 --> 00:13:00,540
In 1961,
it was a hunting law.

209
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,090
I have no idea,
but it goes a little baby then,

210
00:13:03,091 --> 00:13:03,924
but it was about the hunting lawyers and
she didn't like that and he didn't 

211
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,110
signed the,
the law and that was it.

212
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:13,650
He doesn't even have to say why he 
doesn't sign.

213
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:14,783
It just doesn't sign.
And since then it hasn't really been 

214
00:13:17,041 --> 00:13:18,600
necessary.
Of course,

215
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:23,880
a threat to have to,
to make use of the Meta powers of course

216
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,070
has an effect on the working soft 
department.

217
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,850
So you have to get over,
you have to reach a consensus.

218
00:13:29,851 --> 00:13:30,684
It in Indiana.

219
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:35,320
I thought that it will be worthwhile to 
keep,

220
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:36,723
uh,
the veto power of the reigning prince 

221
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,233
except for an initiative.
The people want to abolish the monarchy 

222
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:50,290
because I saw that sometimes you had in 
Switzerland votes,

223
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:54,520
which were perhaps not in the long term 
interest of the country,

224
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:57,660
of the people,
the reigning prince.

225
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,710
We think in generations.

226
00:14:00,290 --> 00:14:01,123
We had 15 or 20 years ago,
we had discussions about this dualism 

227
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:09,170
system and people wanted more power,
but at the end there was a,

228
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:12,950
there was a referendum and 65 percent of
the people said,

229
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:15,020
no,
let's keep it like it is.

230
00:14:15,380 --> 00:14:20,380
You could argue that democracy should 
overrule the Monitor Archaic System,

231
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:24,470
but it's the other way around at the 
moment.

232
00:14:24,471 --> 00:14:29,471
And that has been decided by the people 
referendums they often are,

233
00:14:35,090 --> 00:14:36,710
you know,
with Brexit,

234
00:14:36,711 --> 00:14:37,544
it was like you just had the people who 
wanted to leave calling the people who 

235
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,850
wanted to stay calling the people who 
wanted to leave.

236
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:47,180
And it was kind of this ongoing theme in
relations to that.

237
00:14:47,350 --> 00:14:49,130
Um,
how do you think,

238
00:14:49,131 --> 00:14:49,964
you know,
in a country that has so many 

239
00:14:50,391 --> 00:14:54,230
referendums that people can make 
informed decisions

240
00:14:54,410 --> 00:14:58,550
at two things which we have to take.
You have to take into account before you

241
00:14:58,551 --> 00:14:59,384
introduce it.
One is that you have to start on the 

242
00:15:04,341 --> 00:15:07,630
local basis that people read,
really,

243
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:10,860
uh,
get trained indoors,

244
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:14,560
kind of direct democracy referendums.
Initiative said,

245
00:15:14,561 --> 00:15:19,561
saw where they can see what's the effect
of a stupid decision on the village.

246
00:15:22,041 --> 00:15:23,330
And the city,
whatever,

247
00:15:23,870 --> 00:15:25,980
so that they're seeing is,
is,

248
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:27,103
is one aspect.
The other aspect is that you will have 

249
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:37,810
to inform the people quite a lot we have
in the law and also Switzerland that you

250
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:41,603
as a Jew did to inform,
give the order information to have 

251
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,090
enough time for people to,
uh,

252
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:51,400
before vote,
uh,

253
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:54,350
discussions and so on,
so that,

254
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:59,380
that's very important and you have to 
hand out all the information and neutral

255
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,583
basis.

256
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:02,173
I wanted to ask about that because it 
seems often the information at least 

257
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:11,380
I've seen is handed out by whichever 
newspaper you tend to subscribe to a how

258
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:12,404
does that,
how is that neutral information 

259
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:14,870
disseminated to the population

260
00:16:15,100 --> 00:16:17,860
government?
All the village administration,

261
00:16:17,861 --> 00:16:20,840
if it's just on the local vote,
um,

262
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:22,833
has to hand out the information and 
neutral information where both sides 

263
00:16:28,391 --> 00:16:29,400
can,
uh,

264
00:16:29,410 --> 00:16:32,830
put this information.
There's a,

265
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:37,270
then they can also put their own view 
into there.

266
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:43,080
So that's handed out to all the voters 
so they can look it up.

267
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:48,810
They organize meetings and so on.
So before such a vote,

268
00:16:48,850 --> 00:16:52,990
it's really.
That seems people are well informed.

269
00:16:53,350 --> 00:16:53,970
Yeah.

270
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:55,750
Those,
I don't know,

271
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:58,310
whenever I tend to read stuff written by
government,

272
00:16:58,311 --> 00:16:59,144
it's as an,
I think of myself as reasonably 

273
00:17:01,071 --> 00:17:04,790
intelligence and I read some of this 
stuff,

274
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,990
but I'm like,
uh,

275
00:17:07,790 --> 00:17:08,623
like it's governments can be verbose and
they're not perhaps the best at writing 

276
00:17:13,131 --> 00:17:13,964
things in an easy to understand way.
Is this information presented in a way 

277
00:17:17,241 --> 00:17:17,960
that,
you know,

278
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:19,940
it doesn't require a degree to 
understand.

279
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:23,030
It's kind of like his how it is for the 
every man

280
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:25,873
in your own interest.
If you read in a stupid way or the 

281
00:17:29,811 --> 00:17:33,230
highway which nobody understands is 
going to be rejected,

282
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:36,160
right?
The people writing this,

283
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:44,350
of course you have to check that the,
the right correct way and you can appeal

284
00:17:44,871 --> 00:17:45,704
to the,
to,

285
00:17:45,890 --> 00:17:46,790
to,
to court.

286
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:53,110
So if there's wrong information in,
there was cool.

287
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:56,320
Separation of powers now,
right

288
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:18,420
as I mentioned,
Lichtenstein by by various measures,

289
00:18:18,421 --> 00:18:21,270
the highest GDP per capita in the world.
So very,

290
00:18:21,271 --> 00:18:22,104
very wealthy country and we've been 
walking around and it's reflected in 

291
00:18:25,820 --> 00:18:29,550
beautifully clean streets.
Just a lovely looking place.

292
00:18:29,730 --> 00:18:32,490
But it wasn't always like this was it,
it was,

293
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,990
it was quite different.
So,

294
00:18:34,190 --> 00:18:35,023
uh,
I think I read kind of agrarian was the 

295
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:40,500
time.
Can you tell me a little bit about,

296
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,750
about the history of,
of Lichtenstein,

297
00:18:42,751 --> 00:18:44,400
kind of before,
you know,

298
00:18:44,401 --> 00:18:47,370
it's,
it's relatively recent economic success,

299
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,713
what will know from my predecessor 
around 1700 bought the governing the 

300
00:18:53,211 --> 00:18:54,044
rights of those.
There were two counties in the holy 

301
00:18:56,911 --> 00:18:57,744
Roman Empire.
It was basically have a road bike 

302
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:03,240
exercise because you voted to the 
emperor.

303
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,020
And so for him to get more influence in 
the holy Roman Empire as a prince of the

304
00:19:10,111 --> 00:19:14,820
holy Roman Empire,
a he bold those voting rights because it

305
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,190
was very poor.
And,

306
00:19:16,230 --> 00:19:20,160
and the families who were raining then 
went bankrupt.

307
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:24,060
He could have cross support by his huge 
estates.

308
00:19:24,090 --> 00:19:25,710
It was no problem.
Uh,

309
00:19:25,711 --> 00:19:26,544
those,
uh,

310
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:30,240
two counties and put them together,
made the principality,

311
00:19:30,241 --> 00:19:30,970
artificial.

312
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:33,880
So if he,
he buys the lands because the possession

313
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,860
of the land is what gives him the voting
rights.

314
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:37,813
Not traded the procession of the lag,
but it was the reigning powers over the 

315
00:19:45,621 --> 00:19:47,840
land.
Okay.

316
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:52,460
So the land will still be partly in 
private ownership.

317
00:19:54,250 --> 00:19:55,083
That was separated.
It was some kind of private who bought 

318
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:07,930
some counties have accounts here who 
went bankrupt and to pay for the.

319
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:12,080
For the people who vote,
they owed money.

320
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,693
Then there was a court in the holy Roman
Empire where they just sort of 

321
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:22,650
auctioning off the governing rights and 
my free says a 17 century laws,

322
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,840
very rich,
and he paid the highest price for that.

323
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,133
So it wasn't.
In a way it was still private lands 

324
00:20:35,991 --> 00:20:36,631
ownership.
It was.

325
00:20:36,631 --> 00:20:40,560
He was buying the governing rights or 
you for what is today?

326
00:20:40,561 --> 00:20:41,520
Lichtenstein?
Yes.

327
00:20:42,380 --> 00:20:45,050
Nobody was really interested here in the
land.

328
00:20:45,470 --> 00:20:50,470
The first one to move here to finish,
that was my father in 1938 and the first

329
00:20:52,691 --> 00:20:56,960
of all to wizard what one of his answers
to the predecessor bought.

330
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,023
He came there,
I think when the railway was built 

331
00:21:02,410 --> 00:21:03,243
throughout Australia,
sometimes in the middle of the 19th 

332
00:21:05,651 --> 00:21:07,090
century,
so

333
00:21:07,270 --> 00:21:12,270
hundreds of now I could go visit.
It's not that I've purchased.

334
00:21:13,430 --> 00:21:14,263
What's that?

335
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:16,621
They?
Of course,

336
00:21:16,621 --> 00:21:17,454
they always.
They nominate someone to represent them 

337
00:21:19,681 --> 00:21:24,110
and they paid for the people.
They introduced reforms.

338
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:24,983
They paid for dedication of people.
One of the first countries to introduce 

339
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:34,850
a bonus free educational educational on 
a statewide basis.

340
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,800
So yeah,
we'll try to develop it.

341
00:21:38,070 --> 00:21:38,903
Yeah.

342
00:21:38,970 --> 00:21:41,070
So it,
it existed at that point in your,

343
00:21:41,071 --> 00:21:43,350
you said your father was the first one 
to move here.

344
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:44,491
What,
why?

345
00:21:44,491 --> 00:21:45,324
What changed is,
was it around the time of the war or 

346
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:48,630
whatever?

347
00:21:48,630 --> 00:21:50,160
Of course it,
what?

348
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:53,040
Basically the family lived on the huge 
estates,

349
00:21:53,041 --> 00:21:57,960
what is now the Czech Republic and all 
the palace in Vienna,

350
00:21:58,550 --> 00:22:01,970
whole summer states in Australia still.
Uh,

351
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:03,270
but then,
uh,

352
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:05,130
when,
uh,

353
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:07,800
Hitler,
uh,

354
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:12,860
took over Australia,
well,

355
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:13,933
didn't know what would happen with 
lifting and when the German troops 

356
00:22:17,481 --> 00:22:22,481
marched into Austria by a father who was
not yet during prince,

357
00:22:24,010 --> 00:22:29,010
his,
his great uncle was married to a Jewish,

358
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,780
a barrow nes family was very much anti 
Nazi for

359
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:42,260
see what the married to a baron.
It's probably not best friends.

360
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,440
The randy prints flat to Czechoslovakia 
over the boulder.

361
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:54,010
And my father drove his car,
met the German troops marching towards a

362
00:22:57,020 --> 00:23:00,420
Vienna and try to stabilize it here.
Yeah.

363
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:03,350
Luckily he succeeded that,
uh,

364
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:06,950
we were not the next.
There was a small,

365
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:08,283
uh,
there was a small attempt of a coup 

366
00:23:09,901 --> 00:23:14,770
d'etat he unleashed when Nazi party,
uh,

367
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:19,340
when my father,
I think in 1938 just before the outbreak

368
00:23:19,341 --> 00:23:21,500
of World War Two,
the small,

369
00:23:21,510 --> 00:23:26,300
not Nazi party by the support of some 
Nazi people outside,

370
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:31,430
I seem to governor have to roll and fall
back or southern Germany support that.

371
00:23:32,780 --> 00:23:37,490
They tried to make a mark on the dots 
like the march on Rome,

372
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,020
but to do cheer.
Wow.

373
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:45,140
Was a bad copy.
Bold boat.

374
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:48,760
Yeah.
But then the people heard about it stuff

375
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:51,710
because you couldn't keep it secret.
Uh,

376
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:55,490
so people came together.
The farmers at that time,

377
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,000
you know,
with all the instruments there,

378
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:03,130
hydrocodone forks and all the lawsuits 
on this around the country.

379
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:08,600
Wow.
I failed.

380
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:10,813
Fascinating.

381
00:24:11,170 --> 00:24:12,003
Your father was,
was here and he established what exists 

382
00:24:15,821 --> 00:24:16,660
today,
essentially.

383
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:17,773
That's right when the reigning princes 
came to visit before they build a villa 

384
00:24:23,301 --> 00:24:25,290
up here.
Uh,

385
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:26,353
but they came with settlement.
It was only built in the second half of 

386
00:24:29,151 --> 00:24:31,730
the 19th century when the first came to 
visit.

387
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,043
Uh,
but then the people wanted to have the 

388
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,250
costal,
uh,

389
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,153
which was before a museum adapted so 
that it will be residents or three 

390
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,930
prints and this is where we are and 
that's where we are

391
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:52,170
now.
Most people think that Lichtenstein just

392
00:24:52,171 --> 00:24:56,040
became rich because of that low taxes 
and their secret banking laws.

393
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,440
But this couldn't be further from 
reality.

394
00:24:58,470 --> 00:25:00,810
Now,
of course the financial sector does play

395
00:25:00,811 --> 00:25:04,290
a big role here,
but in fact the industrial sector is the

396
00:25:04,291 --> 00:25:05,124
biggest economic power in Lichtenstein.
Have you heard of the company Hilti or 

397
00:25:08,191 --> 00:25:09,610
Ivr called Viva dense?
Well,

398
00:25:09,611 --> 00:25:12,180
if you haven't heard of that latter one,
the next time you go into the dentist,

399
00:25:12,181 --> 00:25:14,250
have a look at the brands of tools they 
use,

400
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:16,800
most likely they were made in 
Lichtenstein

401
00:25:19,570 --> 00:25:22,880
to hitting system of the company that is
still in the Buckingham Palace.

402
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:23,723
I,
I'm guessing that they updated it from 

403
00:25:24,861 --> 00:25:26,630
this version already,
but yes,

404
00:25:26,631 --> 00:25:30,250
the Buckingham Palace is heated by a 
heating system out of leakage Stein.

405
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,920
So we were,
we were kind of talking and we,

406
00:25:32,930 --> 00:25:33,763
we spoke with other people as well about
the employment situation in licked 

407
00:25:37,060 --> 00:25:38,460
strikes.
It's about 40,000

408
00:25:38,461 --> 00:25:42,810
people in the country,
but a lot of people come from around two

409
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,090
to work here kind of as a commute.
Right.

410
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:49,650
Lichtenstein actually has more.
I'm working places.

411
00:25:49,651 --> 00:25:53,160
Then we have inhabitants.
So we have roughly 38,000

412
00:25:53,161 --> 00:25:55,880
inhabitants and 39,000
chops.

413
00:25:56,610 --> 00:25:57,443
That means we are heavily dependent on 
commuters that come into the country 

414
00:26:00,001 --> 00:26:01,860
each day.
I think it's about 20,000

415
00:26:01,861 --> 00:26:02,694
people that come here each day.
And what are these people typically 

416
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:07,560
doing?
Um,

417
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:12,590
most of them work in the industries in 
like a 40 biggest companies like Hilti,

418
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:16,690
like the evil Claude or the to some 
crooked presta

419
00:26:16,990 --> 00:26:19,990
related to the economy of Lichtenstein.
And you know,

420
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:22,810
I appreciate the history.
Things I didn't,

421
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,750
didn't even know after doing the 
research role of this.

422
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,310
Um,
what,

423
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:32,380
what kind of drove the change from the 
Agrarian Lichtenstein from I suppose,

424
00:26:32,381 --> 00:26:33,214
how it was before your father arrived in
and set things up here to Lichtenstein 

425
00:26:36,581 --> 00:26:40,450
as it is today because while it was at 
60 or 70 years,

426
00:26:40,451 --> 00:26:41,500
it's,
in a way,

427
00:26:41,501 --> 00:26:43,040
it's,
that seems like a lot of time.

428
00:26:43,270 --> 00:26:47,040
It's and not a lot of time for such a 
dramatic transformation.

429
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,973
I think there are several factors which 
were important are one factor was 

430
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,413
already in the 19th century when one of 
my predecessors introduced a general 

431
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:06,090
schooling career,
one of the first states to introduce it,

432
00:27:06,091 --> 00:27:11,091
I think worldwide a thing in Europe 
because on thought because it was a poor

433
00:27:12,181 --> 00:27:16,140
country relying on the subsidies of the 
reigning prints.

434
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:17,333
So at least we should educate the people
so they can find a job outside of Stan 

435
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,620
if they don't find one.
Insight.

436
00:27:24,180 --> 00:27:28,560
One kept the uh,
taxation as low as possible.

437
00:27:28,561 --> 00:27:33,500
So to attract business one was then able
to make a way of Allah.

438
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:34,673
The customers treat you with the Austin 
Hungarian Empire that opened up the big 

439
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:42,990
market before for the local market.
Hopeless,

440
00:27:43,490 --> 00:27:44,323
small too small.
So with access to this large market or 

441
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:53,340
one could attract a Swiss textile 
industry.

442
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,700
Yeah,
because it's a across the border,

443
00:27:56,760 --> 00:28:00,150
but next to it.
But there was a free trade with that.

444
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,400
Otherwise they would have had to pay 
taxes.

445
00:28:02,630 --> 00:28:03,463
It's,
I'm just thinking of the similarities 

446
00:28:05,811 --> 00:28:08,720
with today,
kind of how in the past it was,

447
00:28:09,170 --> 00:28:11,660
we're a very small country.
We want to trade with Austria,

448
00:28:11,661 --> 00:28:12,494
Hungary,
and now it's like European Union in a 

449
00:28:15,821 --> 00:28:16,820
way,
a similar thing.

450
00:28:16,821 --> 00:28:20,240
You have your small country and we,
we saw a healthy,

451
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:22,340
the tool manufacturers,
the dental stuff,

452
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:24,170
of course,
a low taxation,

453
00:28:24,171 --> 00:28:25,610
which is something we'll discuss in a 
bit.

454
00:28:26,030 --> 00:28:29,690
People I think often have these,
these notions where they're like,

455
00:28:29,691 --> 00:28:31,250
they think of something and they're 
like,

456
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:32,113
why is the place rich and Switzerland 
rather than the Lichtenstein as an 

457
00:28:34,911 --> 00:28:36,230
example,
low taxes.

458
00:28:36,231 --> 00:28:37,064
Right.
But the reality is that it's often more 

459
00:28:38,781 --> 00:28:40,900
than that,
whether it's education of an education.

460
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:45,950
Yeah.
And then also access to the markets.

461
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:49,140
Yeah.
If you don't have access to market.

462
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,970
We couldn't even feed our own people.
They were dependent on subsidies,

463
00:28:53,971 --> 00:28:58,590
better any prints,
and of course it became better.

464
00:28:59,010 --> 00:29:04,010
Result really was fine with anger an 
empire and then after it collapsed.

465
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,213
Luckily we got the same three d with 
Switzerland and I was able to push 

466
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:14,331
through thanks to the Eric Democracy,
the European economic market,

467
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,413
because there was a lot of resistance,
a government and parliament and would 

468
00:29:20,421 --> 00:29:21,254
not have gotten through that.
But with direct democracy I was able to 

469
00:29:24,811 --> 00:29:28,100
put it into to a popular vote.
So I brought this.

470
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:30,960
We have several advantages here in 
Lichtenstein.

471
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:32,123
One is that the taxes are not too high.
The other is we are actually in the 

472
00:29:36,450 --> 00:29:37,370
middle of Europe.
Well,

473
00:29:37,710 --> 00:29:42,400
you've seen the distance since you're.
You're everywhere within no time,

474
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:44,260
right?
We're staying in Switzerland while we're

475
00:29:44,261 --> 00:29:46,380
here in Lichtenstein,
just over the border,

476
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:49,420
as you were mentioning the people 
commuting from Austria and Germany,

477
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:50,583
so race in the middle.
We are also located in two different 

478
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:58,660
economic areas at the same time,
so we have very easy access to the Swiss

479
00:29:58,661 --> 00:29:59,494
economic area and.
But we're also part of the European 

480
00:30:02,171 --> 00:30:03,400
economic area.
Right,

481
00:30:03,490 --> 00:30:07,360
right next door to the EU,
right next door to Switzerland.

482
00:30:07,810 --> 00:30:08,643
And we have both.
We have contracts that makes it very 

483
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:12,660
easy.
So if you like,

484
00:30:13,090 --> 00:30:13,923
for example,
if you have an insurance company and it 

485
00:30:16,271 --> 00:30:17,104
is based in Lichtenstein,
you just need one office to work in 

486
00:30:19,961 --> 00:30:20,794
Switzerland and in the EU.
Well if you don't have it in 

487
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:26,710
Lichtenstein and then you need two 
separate offices,

488
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:50,470
I think that the removal of the secret 
banking that was who was here before.

489
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,123
Do you think that.
Do you think that affected 

490
00:30:53,061 --> 00:30:55,400
Lichtenstein's economy much?

491
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:56,773
What it reduced for short terms a tax 
income against my more pessimistic look 

492
00:31:10,531 --> 00:31:11,364
at it,
I was very much in favor of opening it 

493
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,454
up because it exposes so much criticism 
of those banks or the financial 

494
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:24,090
industry.
They recovered after two,

495
00:31:24,091 --> 00:31:28,410
three years perhaps also because they 
always said,

496
00:31:28,560 --> 00:31:29,393
oh,
we're not going to be able to apportion 

497
00:31:31,620 --> 00:31:32,453
this begging secrecy,
which was introduced sometime before 

498
00:31:35,941 --> 00:31:38,250
world war two,
but Swiss and so on.

499
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:42,700
So that that's changing though.
You will have really two,

500
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:43,703
two,
if you want to survive in the long term 

501
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:46,403
as a bank or in the financial industry,
you will have to offer good service for 

502
00:31:51,570 --> 00:31:56,570
people who are willing to pay also that 
taxes in their home country.

503
00:31:57,270 --> 00:31:58,470
I think that's another thing that

504
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:01,550
that I picked up on was with these 
smaller states,

505
00:32:01,551 --> 00:32:03,800
you can really focus on,
you know,

506
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:05,203
instead of like you say,
the reality is this is the way the 

507
00:32:08,331 --> 00:32:09,164
world's going.
People need to be open with their 

508
00:32:10,911 --> 00:32:12,770
finances.
This is how it's going to,

509
00:32:13,040 --> 00:32:13,873
how it's going to be,
and then you could switch to a focus on 

510
00:32:16,071 --> 00:32:20,060
let's do really good banking.
Let's be really excellent banks.

511
00:32:20,061 --> 00:32:20,894
Let's not be generic.
Giant Bank won't pick up the phone on 

512
00:32:25,130 --> 00:32:26,540
Saturday morning,
so you,

513
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:30,670
that's be really good at this.
Which is important.

514
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:32,193
Do you think that's another one of the 
reasons why you know Lichtenstein is an 

515
00:32:35,001 --> 00:32:35,834
economy has done so well because you can
focus on doing things really rather 

516
00:32:39,771 --> 00:32:40,604
than.

517
00:32:41,030 --> 00:32:42,290
I think so,
yes.

518
00:32:42,291 --> 00:32:46,040
I think it was the education system.
It was low taxation.

519
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:51,700
It was the realization that you would 
only be able to survive in a small,

520
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:58,880
a small country in an economy with no 
whole market.

521
00:32:58,990 --> 00:33:03,990
You had to compete on the world markets 
to survive and nobody's going to protect

522
00:33:05,271 --> 00:33:06,104
you.
The government cannot afford to support 

523
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:12,460
one of our larger manufacturing 
companies that we read.

524
00:33:12,650 --> 00:33:13,483
We just,
then we would have to raise taxes and 

525
00:33:17,091 --> 00:33:18,720
there will be immediately,
uh,

526
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,390
uh,
uh,

527
00:33:20,391 --> 00:33:23,390
an initiative but the people in the 
popular vote.

528
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:24,343
Why,
why should we pay more taxes to support 

529
00:33:29,300 --> 00:33:30,800
Mr Archbold,
Mr Hill,

530
00:33:31,040 --> 00:33:32,210
Mr Mayor,
Mr.

531
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:33,490
whatever Mueller.

532
00:33:34,340 --> 00:33:39,340
This is why like your system,
because I feel this sometimes happens in

533
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:42,140
other countries.
Maybe my is.

534
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,080
We didn't really get to say it's like A.
Yeah,

535
00:33:45,081 --> 00:33:45,880
we,
um,

536
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,720
we,
we just gave them loads of money because

537
00:33:47,721 --> 00:33:49,330
they were in trouble.
Um,

538
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:51,890
Le Pen,
trump,

539
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,080
UKIP.
Why now do you,

540
00:33:54,081 --> 00:33:56,870
do you have an opinion on why?
Why do you think this is happening now?

541
00:33:56,930 --> 00:34:01,930
We see changes in the whole system of 
indirect democracy.

542
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:08,150
People get more detached.
Everything has become more complicated.

543
00:34:08,151 --> 00:34:08,984
You have globalization.
There's not so much possibility to 

544
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:13,783
decide only for your state.
All that makes people very unhappy and 

545
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:21,853
therefore populism easy solutions that 
people never really had looked much and 

546
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:30,350
why this law or that law like 
Switzerland or here,

547
00:34:30,830 --> 00:34:34,580
there was also in Switzerland,
populist movements to certain degree on,

548
00:34:35,240 --> 00:34:36,073
on immigration,
but that quietened down when it will 

549
00:34:38,871 --> 00:34:39,704
solve more or less and here divorce,
but not much and that I think is 

550
00:34:45,411 --> 00:34:50,411
something that has somehow tried me for 
quite some time.

551
00:34:54,190 --> 00:34:55,023
Those states who are,
in my opinion to certainly over 

552
00:34:57,431 --> 00:34:58,264
centralized an ultra filling anymore the
duties which are expected from the 

553
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:08,200
people and that creates populism and,
and,

554
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,053
and easy.
So you and things like this and I think 

555
00:35:12,460 --> 00:35:16,230
I've seen a lot of easy solutions.
The appeal of easy solution,

556
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,510
is it a solution?
And very often they're catastrophists.

557
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,373
Yes.

558
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:27,120
Narrowly avoided sometimes.
Do you think increasing globalization,

559
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:34,540
you know,
maybe really is going to lead to more of

560
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:35,374
this.
Do you think this is something we're 

561
00:35:36,101 --> 00:35:38,070
going to see continue?
Do you think this is

562
00:35:38,070 --> 00:35:38,903
kind of a something we're going to see 
fade away as people perhaps realize 

563
00:35:42,751 --> 00:35:43,584
that,
you know,

564
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,023
once we've elected a populous,
they're not all they're cracked up to 

565
00:35:46,531 --> 00:35:47,550
be,
it's,

566
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:48,443
I don't think it's going to fade away 
because globalization is going to 

567
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:54,160
increase,
uh,

568
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:59,300
you really think you have to adapt to 
this new situation and really know their

569
00:36:03,151 --> 00:36:03,984
ordination state and social state told 
the people that we are going to produce 

570
00:36:09,601 --> 00:36:13,980
heaven here on earth and that doesn't 
turn out like that.

571
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:14,963
And so there's resentment on that and 
people have the feeling that the people 

572
00:36:18,861 --> 00:36:22,260
up there,
the adult contact anymore with us,

573
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:23,133
they're detached,
they're just looking for their own 

574
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,234
position,
they own money and that creates this 

575
00:36:30,331 --> 00:36:33,090
kind of populism.
And uh,

576
00:36:33,091 --> 00:36:34,050
and that's,
I think,

577
00:36:34,051 --> 00:36:38,600
a danger for democracy and that worries 
me.

578
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,310
That's one of the reasons why I wrote my
book.

579
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,460
I just want to say it's been a real 
pleasure to,

580
00:36:43,550 --> 00:36:44,383
to ask you this.
Have you given me your thoughts and 

581
00:36:46,021 --> 00:36:48,390
everything.
It's been a pleasure.

582
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:51,990
It was an interesting discussion for me.
Tall glass.

583
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,180
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

584
00:37:03,290 --> 00:37:05,000
Now,
as we often say here,

585
00:37:05,001 --> 00:37:05,834
official policy of not everything is 
perfect and despite the success of 

586
00:37:08,931 --> 00:37:12,260
Lichtenstein's model,
there are still many questions.

587
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:16,070
Is it legitimate that the head of state 
is not chosen by his citizens?

588
00:37:16,071 --> 00:37:19,460
Could this system really be implemented 
in big nations?

589
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:20,750
Well,
now it's your turn.

590
00:37:20,780 --> 00:37:23,450
Please do leave your answer in the 
comment section below.

591
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,940
We'd love to hear from you and perhaps 
many of you right now,

592
00:37:25,941 --> 00:37:27,500
you're hungry for a little bit more.
Well,

593
00:37:27,501 --> 00:37:30,200
if that is the case,
we do have a bonus for you.

594
00:37:30,230 --> 00:37:33,980
You can watch the entire interview with 
the prince and it has many,

595
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:35,750
many more questions in it's in that 
video.

596
00:37:35,751 --> 00:37:39,430
We talk about history of the war on 
drugs and of course immigration.

597
00:37:39,431 --> 00:37:39,490
Yeah,

598
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:44,490
especially the rich people moved in 
before we put those restrictions because

599
00:37:44,861 --> 00:37:45,694
of the low taxation,
they would buy nice houses and Nice 

600
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:54,220
building places where as the local paper
