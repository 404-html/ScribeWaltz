1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:11,120
the full rights and Germany are two 
things that sound pretty scary.

3
00:00:11,121 --> 00:00:11,954
You when you put them together.
This is why even though Angela Merkel 

4
00:00:14,151 --> 00:00:16,160
has won the elections with a high 
margin,

5
00:00:16,250 --> 00:00:18,560
it has been a bittersweet victory.
The facts,

6
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:20,870
the alternative for Germany,
a Zena phobic,

7
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:21,733
ultra conservative party has become the 
third largest political force is bad 

8
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:29,300
enough to make merkel rather uneasy.
We don't need to beat around the bush.

9
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:31,370
We wanted a better result.
That is clear.

10
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,413
Angela Merkel it revision policy,
what we plan to do a video this week 

11
00:00:34,881 --> 00:00:36,680
about Germany,
but the current news,

12
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:37,820
forster,
stupid spoon,

13
00:00:37,821 --> 00:00:38,654
that video so we could have time to 
prepare this one explaining what's an 

14
00:00:41,421 --> 00:00:46,070
alternative for journey or afd as it's 
known in Germany is all about and yes,

15
00:00:46,071 --> 00:00:47,930
I probably know what you're thinking 
right now.

16
00:00:47,931 --> 00:00:48,764
You're probably thinking,
come on Simon and how could you not 

17
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:54,230
predict that the far right would be a 
big hit in Germany because well,

18
00:00:54,231 --> 00:00:55,064
at the end of the day,
Zena phobic parties that pretty much in 

19
00:00:56,481 --> 00:01:01,370
fashion all across Europe plus afd did 
great in previous local elections.

20
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,220
Nevertheless,
most of the polls said that Germans love

21
00:01:10,221 --> 00:01:11,054
moderation above all else,
and that's not just the electoral polls 

22
00:01:13,671 --> 00:01:15,860
talking,
but also sociological studies.

23
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:17,240
For instance,
while in France,

24
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,074
only 50% of the population places 
themselves on the center of the 

25
00:01:20,481 --> 00:01:23,840
spectrum.
This number in Germany is as high as 76%

26
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:26,660
for the Germans have many reasons to be 
happy.

27
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:27,613
They almost didn't suffer at all during 
the economic crisis and now that our 

28
00:01:30,801 --> 00:01:33,470
economy is doing better than ever,
it's salaries are rising,

29
00:01:33,471 --> 00:01:34,304
there's almost full employment and 
companies export abroad as if there was 

30
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:38,054
no tomorrow.
So the big question here becomes who 

31
00:01:40,521 --> 00:01:44,330
votes for the far right wing in Germany 
and most important of all,

32
00:01:44,331 --> 00:01:46,250
what is the alternative for Germany 
wants?

33
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:49,910
Are they really a radical party or is 
the media exaggerating?

34
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:51,830
Well,
today we're going to answer all of those

35
00:01:51,831 --> 00:01:54,560
questions,
but as usual before we get started,

36
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:55,790
let's have a look at the history.

37
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:00,250
A party on the divide.
Yes,

38
00:02:00,251 --> 00:02:02,200
it is true today alternative for 
Germany.

39
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,034
They are a populist political party with
a big focus on rejecting immigrants and 

40
00:02:07,031 --> 00:02:07,864
refugees specifically.
They want to reject those who come from 

41
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,850
Islamic countries,
but just by all of this,

42
00:02:12,851 --> 00:02:16,060
it's origins couldn't be more different 
than what it is today.

43
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:19,030
Let's go back to the year 2013 now.
Back then,

44
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:19,923
all the European media talks about was 
the debt crisis that was happening in 

45
00:02:22,781 --> 00:02:24,430
countries like Spain,
Italy,

46
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:28,150
and it's specially Greece now.
In case you don't know the history here,

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,013
let's have a quick summary.
Before 2008 German banks invested a lot 

48
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,320
of money in lending to companies and 
governments in the south of Europe,

49
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:39,183
and it's after the financial crisis of 
2008 these countries couldn't give the 

50
00:02:42,251 --> 00:02:43,510
money back.
In fact,

51
00:02:43,511 --> 00:02:47,050
they needed even more cash so that they 
could afford their current spending.

52
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:49,750
This included things like the salaries 
of civil servants,

53
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:52,690
highways and hospitals,
and as you can imagine,

54
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,620
paying day to day spending with debt.
It's a far from ideal situation.

55
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,190
So this is where Angela Merkel comes 
along and says,

56
00:03:02,191 --> 00:03:04,290
all right guys,
I'm going to lend you the money.

57
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:06,930
I will even let you give it back 
whenever you want,

58
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:10,830
but you've got to make some reforms.
See your economic systems.

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,380
These reforms,
they were known as austerity.

60
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:14,273
Germany,
alongside with other northern European 

61
00:03:15,811 --> 00:03:17,850
countries,
wanted to lend money to Italy,

62
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,140
Spain,
and Greece,

63
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,033
while at the same time demanding some 
budget cuts so that these countries 

64
00:03:22,711 --> 00:03:26,910
would no longer need to borrow as much 
money in the future and so that they can

65
00:03:26,911 --> 00:03:28,740
pay back their debts.
Those conditions.

66
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:29,574
They were seen as pretty draconian by 
most of those southern European 

67
00:03:32,011 --> 00:03:33,690
countries.
They were asking the question,

68
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:34,524
well,
whose Germany to tell us how we should 

69
00:03:35,671 --> 00:03:37,110
spend our money?
Meanwhile,

70
00:03:37,111 --> 00:03:37,944
some Germans,
they were also pretty mad at their 

71
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:39,870
governments.
I mean,

72
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:40,704
they were thinking,
who are you merkel to go around giving 

73
00:03:42,181 --> 00:03:44,400
money to everyone?
This is the European Union,

74
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:48,230
not an NGO.
Now,

75
00:03:48,231 --> 00:03:51,590
among those angry Germans,
there were three famous economists,

76
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:53,900
Alexander Garlands,
Burn luck,

77
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:54,763
and Conrad Adam.
These were the founders of the party 

78
00:03:56,690 --> 00:04:01,640
electorial alternative 2013 which would 
later become an alternative for Germany.

79
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,523
Any of these first supporters were 
bankers and university professors from 

80
00:04:05,601 --> 00:04:08,210
the western part of Germany,
cities like Frankfurt,

81
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:10,370
Cologne and bond,
and do you remember this?

82
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:12,630
Because it's going to become really 
important later on

83
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:20,850
now in the electoral roll manifesto,
they suggested that Germany should leave

84
00:04:20,851 --> 00:04:24,000
the euro and go back to the German mark 
as well.

85
00:04:24,001 --> 00:04:24,751
Why was that?
Well,

86
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:28,020
this is because they believe that they 
could avoid bailouts to porter economies

87
00:04:28,021 --> 00:04:28,854
by doing so and even more importantly,
they could protect their economy from a 

88
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:35,910
luckily devaluation of the euro.
As we've said in previous videos,

89
00:04:35,911 --> 00:04:38,790
Germany success was partly due to their 
strong currency

90
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:44,703
pain and Greece.
They were pushing the European central 

91
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,233
banks print more money so that they 
could pay their debts back and as you 

92
00:04:50,061 --> 00:04:51,530
probably know,
economists,

93
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:52,364
they thought that was a pretty bad idea.
The first stereotypical afd voters 

94
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,240
weren't like the stereotype of an 
extreme right wing hooligan.

95
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,850
They were considered to be businessmen,
economists,

96
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:02,743
and university teachers.
This is why the media started calling 

97
00:05:04,941 --> 00:05:05,774
this party,
that quote to Teachers Party and why 

98
00:05:06,981 --> 00:05:11,810
they couldn't win a single MP during the
federal elections of 2013 I mean,

99
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,644
think about it,
and monetary policy has not exactly a 

100
00:05:14,391 --> 00:05:15,224
sexy topic for an electoral campaign.
I mean pretty much only you're going to 

101
00:05:18,651 --> 00:05:20,720
be watching this video care about that 
kind of stuff.

102
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:26,370
Okay.
Nonetheless,

103
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:30,900
the phase of alternative for Germany,
it was to change in July of 2015 at that

104
00:05:30,901 --> 00:05:31,734
moment,
the economist burn lot of course the 

105
00:05:33,091 --> 00:05:35,850
chairman bar to the brand new leader,
frauke petry,

106
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,760
she had other plants.
I'd like the previous Cedars Petrie came

107
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:39,594
from the eastern part of the country and
this means she brought eight hopefully 

108
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:44,093
different political culture for her 
monetary policy deficits and fiscal 

109
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:49,800
responsibility wasn't really,
that's important.

110
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:50,843
Instead,
she knew there was a big Nisha voters 

111
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:57,270
who wanted an iron fist on things like 
immigration and national identity.

112
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,183
Besides these kinds of suggestions would
give her the support of other leaders 

113
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:03,050
like Nigel Farrage from Britain's Ukip 
Party,

114
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:05,510
Marine Le Pen from the National Front in
France,

115
00:06:05,630 --> 00:06:09,020
and of course our favorite politician 
than the visual politic mascot.

116
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,180
Yes,
my dear viewer.

117
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:13,220
Of course we are talking about the one 
and only

118
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:16,170
you up

119
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,210
Germany's far right wing party meets 
Putin allies in,

120
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:19,300
yeah,

121
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,133
Moscow.

122
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:26,540
I know,
I know Vladimir Putin is an ever popular

123
00:06:26,541 --> 00:06:28,340
topic here at visual politic.
That's what I mean.

124
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:30,820
How can we resist talking about him?
No.

125
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:33,440
During this time,
thousands of refugees from Syria,

126
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:35,330
Iraq and Libya,
they came to Germany,

127
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:36,613
Angela Merkel,
she welcomes them with arms wide open 

128
00:06:39,650 --> 00:06:42,530
and well some Germans,
they didn't really like this,

129
00:06:42,590 --> 00:06:45,650
so in the regional elections of 2016 
I'll tell him this.

130
00:06:45,651 --> 00:06:48,110
If the Germany launched an electoral 
platform,

131
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,740
which had nothing to do with what the 
founders had in mind at the beginning,

132
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:55,530
this is why many of those economists,
they jumped ship among them.

133
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,540
Luck.
It was the first presidents,

134
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,530
pardon,

135
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:05,590
has fallen irretrievably into the wrong 
hands band.

136
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:06,424
Luca since then,
alternative for Germany has had two 

137
00:07:08,251 --> 00:07:10,500
factions fighting each other.
On the one hand,

138
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,720
we have the people leftover from the 
first group,

139
00:07:12,750 --> 00:07:14,990
but they are less and less important to 
everyday ends.

140
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,833
On the other hand,
we have those who came under the 

141
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:20,310
leadership of Frauke petry.
This new political structure.

142
00:07:20,311 --> 00:07:23,220
It does mean more voters,
but it also means more problems.

143
00:07:23,470 --> 00:07:24,303
Sorry.

144
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:27,203
The ftes,
current crisis was triggered in mid 

145
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:32,100
January through a tableau breaking 
speech by right when you're bjorn hookah

146
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:36,450
who in a beer hall and dressed in call 
for 180 degree turn in Germany's culture

147
00:07:36,451 --> 00:07:40,370
of remembering and atoning for the Nazi 
era regardless of how far right when you

148
00:07:40,371 --> 00:07:41,204
want it to be.
These kinds of things then not really 

149
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:46,260
cool in Germany and this created many 
problems from this is patrick.

150
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:50,340
There are some investigations open 
because apparently some of the proposals

151
00:07:50,341 --> 00:07:51,174
on her program might be illegal.
Remember that German law is made to 

152
00:07:54,391 --> 00:07:55,224
avoid any resurgence of Nazis.
The issues in this party are big enough 

153
00:07:59,161 --> 00:07:59,994
that even Fralca pitcher you herself had
to resign one day after this last 

154
00:08:03,781 --> 00:08:08,100
election due to in fighting with some of
the more extreme factions of things

155
00:08:08,150 --> 00:08:08,983
party.

156
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,810
Nevertheless,
with or without the unfortunate quote,

157
00:08:12,811 --> 00:08:14,340
Sam's,
the internal division,

158
00:08:14,490 --> 00:08:15,420
Alzheimer's.
If for Germany,

159
00:08:15,421 --> 00:08:17,700
it has become the big surprise from this
election.

160
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,020
So the question now becomes,
oh,

161
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:21,600
voted for them.
Well,

162
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:26,630
let's take a look at this history of 
two.

163
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:32,610
Germany's for the past few years,
the German economy has been on fire,

164
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:33,503
salaries are growing,
companies are exporting and inequality 

165
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:38,250
is almost nonexistent.
Well,

166
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:41,280
actually just hold on for my own because
that last bit,

167
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:45,030
it's not exactly sure.
Now of course there is almost no poverty

168
00:08:45,031 --> 00:08:47,520
on the streets and that our factories 
all over the country,

169
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,550
but when we look at the income 
distribution by regions,

170
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:54,300
do you see a clear division?
If you pay attention to this map,

171
00:08:54,301 --> 00:08:56,370
you'll see a part,
the red part,

172
00:09:04,090 --> 00:09:05,780
it's a bleed.
Pause is the wealthiest.

173
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,860
The red part is the poorest.
The blue part is what used to be western

174
00:09:09,861 --> 00:09:13,250
Germany and the red part is what used to
be eastern Germany,

175
00:09:13,340 --> 00:09:16,130
communist Germany or that eastern part 
of the country is the Germany,

176
00:09:16,131 --> 00:09:20,540
the wing capitalist in 1989 but still 
doesn't have the same standard of living

177
00:09:20,541 --> 00:09:21,374
as the west.
If you visit a city like Dresden in 

178
00:09:23,031 --> 00:09:23,864
eastern Germany,
you will see lots of construction going 

179
00:09:25,851 --> 00:09:26,684
on.
Most of the buildings they were 

180
00:09:27,261 --> 00:09:28,094
completed just a couple of years ago,
this is indicative that the 

181
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:33,740
reunification of Germany,
it's still very much an ongoing process.

182
00:09:33,860 --> 00:09:34,491
Now,
of course,

183
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:35,324
if we compare these standards of living 
of an eastern German with a Greek or a 

184
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:40,130
Spaniard,
it doesn't look that bad,

185
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:40,983
but it's Germans.
They like to be compared with other 

186
00:09:42,441 --> 00:09:44,840
Germans,
and when you do that,

187
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:45,750
things look,
wait,

188
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:46,460
wes,

189
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,293
she made,
doesn't have enough industrial 

190
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:51,800
opportunity and it lacks proper 
educational facilities.

191
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,253
A large sport and cultural center aren't
enough to keep people from leaving the 

192
00:09:55,971 --> 00:09:58,790
city.
It's dead quiet in the town center.

193
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,300
Young people have left in droves for 
bigger cities in the west.

194
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:07,520
A sculpture on the riverbank mirrors the
city's troubled hopes for the future.

195
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,573
In this city,
the city of sweat alternative for 

196
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,004
Germany got over 20% of the votes and 
Julissa further south in the state of 

197
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,234
Saxony.
Most people are voting for the far 

198
00:10:17,101 --> 00:10:17,934
right,
but hold on a minute because we're not 

199
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:19,644
just talking about the economy here.
We're talking about a totally different 

200
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,580
culture.
Think about it.

201
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,473
East Germans lived for entire 
generations under a totally different 

202
00:10:28,081 --> 00:10:30,750
political system.
This means a different education,

203
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:34,110
a different lifestyle and different 
values here.

204
00:10:34,170 --> 00:10:36,270
Moderation.
It's not really a good thing.

205
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,920
In fact,
of the left wing party day,

206
00:10:37,921 --> 00:10:40,830
Linka gets most of its votes in eastern 
Berlin,

207
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:45,120
but there's more than that.
Well,

208
00:10:45,121 --> 00:10:48,120
western German spent decades remembering
their Nazi past.

209
00:10:48,150 --> 00:10:48,983
The government of the Democratic 
Republic of Germany tried to create a 

210
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:55,110
new sense of national pride.
So when an afd candidate says that,

211
00:10:55,111 --> 00:10:55,944
we must appreciate the courage of the 
German soldiers during World War Two 

212
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,190
Germans from Cologne or frightened,
but Germans from Leipzig say,

213
00:11:02,250 --> 00:11:02,911
well,
okay,

214
00:11:02,911 --> 00:11:03,840
whatever.
All right,

215
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:06,030
but now there is a really important 
question.

216
00:11:06,150 --> 00:11:10,140
Why is eastern Germany is so much 
against refugees and immigrants?

217
00:11:10,350 --> 00:11:11,183
Well,
many of you might think this is because 

218
00:11:12,121 --> 00:11:15,090
they are tired of Muslims who don't want
to integrate into their culture.

219
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:16,200
Right?
Well,

220
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,470
here comes a number that is going to 
absolutely blow your minds.

221
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,680
There aren't 9 million immigrants living
in Germany and less than 500,000 in East

222
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:26,233
German.

223
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:31,040
And when you're ready,
think about it.

224
00:11:31,041 --> 00:11:32,600
This makes total sense.
I mean those,

225
00:11:32,601 --> 00:11:33,434
he moved to Germany,
they want to be in the wealthiest 

226
00:11:34,941 --> 00:11:35,774
regions.
So if you walked down the streets of 

227
00:11:36,981 --> 00:11:37,814
Dresden,
you're hardly ever going to see a woman 

228
00:11:38,781 --> 00:11:39,614
covering her head with a hijab.
And then guess who is the biggest 

229
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:44,240
immigrant community in eastern Germany?
While surprise,

230
00:11:44,241 --> 00:11:46,100
surprise,
that would be the Russians.

231
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:48,700
Well then half of the immigrants living 
on this side of the country,

232
00:11:48,701 --> 00:11:52,310
it come from the lands of Putin and of 
course they are the biggest audience for

233
00:11:52,311 --> 00:11:53,144
German,
Russia,

234
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:56,110
Allan's well,
this explains things like this.

235
00:11:58,570 --> 00:12:02,230
FD Deploys Double Headed Eagle to snare 
Russian German voters.

236
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:05,350
So now the question becomes,
do you think alternative for Germany can

237
00:12:05,351 --> 00:12:06,184
keep growing in the next election or 
we'll it's internal divisions end up 

238
00:12:09,041 --> 00:12:09,874
destroying the party.
And what do you think this part you can 

239
00:12:11,291 --> 00:12:12,124
achieve over the next four years?
