1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,273
I'm going to start off today's video by 
asking you a question and please don't 

2
00:00:10,651 --> 00:00:13,980
Google it overwhelmed you just read the 
title of the episode,

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,470
but it doesn't really matter anyway.
We're betting for you didn't know,

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,690
but I can go into with the world's most 
expensive country and if you did well,

5
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:22,780
well done to you.
Well,

6
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:24,240
when it comes to expensive places to 
live,

7
00:00:24,241 --> 00:00:27,040
most people think of New York or Hong 
Kong or is uric.

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:30,090
Well,
that's not even close to right.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:31,013
The world's most expensive sitting is 
Luanda the capital city of Angola and 

10
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,620
Yep.
That's an African

11
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:37,870
country.

12
00:00:40,190 --> 00:00:41,023
So rented apartments in Luanda.
You can end up paying over $5,000 a 

13
00:00:43,891 --> 00:00:45,730
month.
How about the cost of a big Mac menu?

14
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:46,730
Mackey,
Ds,

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:50,280
well bounce.
Nineteen American donors and if you want

16
00:00:50,281 --> 00:00:51,114
to have an internet connection at home,
well you better hope you've got a 

17
00:00:53,161 --> 00:00:57,870
healthy bank balance because that's 
going to cost you around $300 a month.

18
00:00:57,900 --> 00:00:59,250
And they were not kidding.
All right,

19
00:00:59,251 --> 00:00:59,881
so 91,
five.

20
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:01,980
You wondering what that was going on in 
Angola?

21
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:04,590
Is this some sort of extremely wealthy 
country that.

22
00:01:04,591 --> 00:01:09,591
No one knows about.
Well No.

23
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:14,950
The Republic of Angola is one of the 
world's biggest oil exporters,

24
00:01:14,980 --> 00:01:17,680
surpassing other oil rich countries like
Qatar.

25
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,573
Nevertheless,
half of its population has no access to 

26
00:01:21,431 --> 00:01:21,850
clean

27
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:22,683
modern.

28
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:28,703
Every three children suffer from 
malnutrition and one out of every six 

29
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,620
dies before reaching five years ago,

30
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:35,553
a

31
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:39,803
on the other ends of the spectrum and to
is home to one of the wealthiest women 

32
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,760
on the planet.
That would be Isabelle dos Santos,

33
00:01:45,761 --> 00:01:48,590
who by the way is the daughter of former
presidents and Jay said,

34
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:53,890
sounds awesome.
Yeah.

35
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,940
Might be figuring out what's going on 
here.

36
00:01:58,140 --> 00:01:59,670
Oh yes,
I go,

37
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:03,350
La is one of the most corrupt countries 
on the planets.

38
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,363
Indeed,
it was home to one of the biggest 

39
00:02:05,391 --> 00:02:06,224
financial fiascos in reason years with 
several companies losing billions of 

40
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:11,053
dollars in this country.
While perhaps this is no surprise to 

41
00:02:12,861 --> 00:02:14,450
you,
I mean at the end of the day and go,

42
00:02:14,451 --> 00:02:19,451
there is still a third world country.
Nevertheless,

43
00:02:21,111 --> 00:02:24,170
that is a question that must be asked 
here.

44
00:02:24,380 --> 00:02:27,900
How did they get here?
How could the country possibly have such

45
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:30,950
a bizarre economy?
And more importantly,

46
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:31,843
how is it possible that the ruling party
managers to keep control of this 

47
00:02:34,641 --> 00:02:35,750
country?
Well,

48
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:37,610
today we're going to answer those 
questions,

49
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:39,820
but first we do need to have a look at 
it.

50
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:40,983
Great.

51
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,733
And diplomacy.
First thing we need to understand when 

52
00:02:49,241 --> 00:02:50,074
we talk about Africa is the most of the 
African countries were colonies in past 

53
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,023
centuries.

54
00:02:58,390 --> 00:02:59,223
European

55
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,340
like Belgium,

56
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,173
France and Portugal,
invaded and most of the continents 

57
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:04,203
imposing rules and treating the natives 
like animals and go to it wasn't an 

58
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:12,040
exception until 1975.
Portugal made a fortune with its diamond

59
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,110
mines in the country.
Nevertheless,

60
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,960
in that city,
the Portuguese government push to by the

61
00:03:16,961 --> 00:03:21,160
UN and its own people recognized and 
Gunas self determination.

62
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:25,240
And then the question was,
what happens after a country stops being

63
00:03:25,241 --> 00:03:26,074
a colony who takes care of the 
governmental affairs after the European 

64
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,123
colonizers?

65
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:35,673
Well,
instead of answering this question by 

66
00:03:37,211 --> 00:03:38,044
calling for elections,
the many angerland trines created 

67
00:03:40,481 --> 00:03:42,640
different from zen started the civil 
war.

68
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:44,280
Well,
that was a conflict that then when's the

69
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:46,390
last 25 years?
And there are still parts of the country

70
00:03:46,391 --> 00:03:47,224
today where you call them go because 
they're just covered in lamb's mind is 

71
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:53,570
in case you don't know what landmine is,
it is a bomb that you bury underground.

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:56,710
Then when someone steps on,
it explodes as well.

73
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:57,573
Now you might be wondering how is it 
possible that such a poor country could 

74
00:03:59,711 --> 00:04:02,650
afford all of these weapons and it was a
big long civil.

75
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,443
Well,
we almost have that one lies in the 

76
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:11,214
diamonds that we previously mentioned.
All signs of the conflict sold diamonds 

77
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:19,320
and in exchange God arms.
But we've provided these arms will often

78
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:20,011
19,
76.

79
00:04:20,011 --> 00:04:22,920
When true civil war kicks off,
there were two sides.

80
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,680
On the one hand,
there was the units agreed who dominated

81
00:04:25,681 --> 00:04:26,514
the south of the country,
units that were supported by South 

82
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:28,890
Africa,
China,

83
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,020
and to a lesser extent,
the United States,

84
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,713
the days of the Cold War and every war 
in any parts of the globe was seen as a 

85
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:40,300
good opportunity to weaken Soviet 
influence.

86
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:43,450
Plus it was known that Angola had oil 
reserves.

87
00:04:43,510 --> 00:04:47,560
It's also explains why the Soviet Union 
wanted to take part in the conflict too.

88
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:51,610
They were supporters of the Angolan 
People's liberation movements or as they

89
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:53,080
called it,
the MPLA,

90
00:04:53,140 --> 00:04:55,710
but most of the world leader of the Mpla
was Josie,

91
00:04:55,770 --> 00:05:00,100
Eduardo dos Santos Santos did have the 
support of the Soviet Union,

92
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,053
but interestingly,
the country that offered the most 

93
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,360
support was actually cute

94
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,100
and we're following our treatment 
nationalists duty,

95
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:15,970
but don't.
Right.

96
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:18,530
He didn't stop at selling weapons to dos
Santos.

97
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:20,630
He sends over 30,000 troops to the 
country.

98
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,900
Let's not only that,
during the lengthy macy's,

99
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:23,743
the area that was under the MPLA control
received a lot of doctors and engineers 

100
00:05:27,141 --> 00:05:27,974
from Ivana.

101
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:30,020
This explain.

102
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:32,770
That's partly why dos Santos one,
the conflict.

103
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:33,813
In fact,
despite the war still be ongoing during 

104
00:05:35,681 --> 00:05:36,514
the 19 nineties,
this man had taken control of most of 

105
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,460
the country.
However,

106
00:05:39,461 --> 00:05:40,720
that Cuban help,
well,

107
00:05:40,721 --> 00:05:43,590
it wasn't as useful as you might think.
For example,

108
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,300
the agriculture experts in from Cuba 
tried to grow sugarcane on Angolan soil,

109
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,253
but there's apparently those seeds were 
not good for the kind of soil that you 

110
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:52,630
find in Angola.

111
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:57,980
And this

112
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
is why within just a few years,
most of the farming lands in the 

113
00:06:00,861 --> 00:06:02,730
country,
it became totally infertile.

114
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,370
This meant stole vacation for Angolans 
and an anger towards the Cuban help.

115
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:09,830
Alright,
so as if this really wasn't enough after

116
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:12,820
the collapse of the Soviet Union at 
Water Dot Santos,

117
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:15,260
realize that it's a good idea to the 
friends,

118
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:20,261
the capitalist country,
at the end of the day,

119
00:06:21,470 --> 00:06:24,020
these were the countries which would buy
their oil.

120
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,960
On the other hand is America was not 
helping eunice hair anymore.

121
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:27,823
So what does this country need to do to 
become an ally of the so called free 

122
00:06:30,981 --> 00:06:32,030
wealth?
Well,

123
00:06:32,031 --> 00:06:32,864
BEC was only one thing to do when that 
was removed the word Marxist from their 

124
00:06:35,751 --> 00:06:39,830
vocabulary and swap it out for free 
market democracy.

125
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:40,813
And yes,
I do say that with a touch of sarcasm 

126
00:06:42,411 --> 00:06:44,660
because Angolan capitalism.
Well,

127
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:49,661
that's certainly one of a kind.
You're seeing the Angolan way yet.

128
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:55,143
Two thousand and two,
it was a turning point in [inaudible] 

129
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:57,553
history.
Eduardo Cental signed the peace 

130
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:01,220
agreements with his adversaries since 
then,

131
00:07:01,221 --> 00:07:06,200
unit has become a political party with a
right to run for elections for the first

132
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:08,750
time in history and garlands.
Could enjoy democracy,

133
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:11,120
but not so many vast.
In the very same year.

134
00:07:11,121 --> 00:07:12,410
Another meaningful thing

135
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:20,340
makes burst ultra deep water,
oil discovery off the coast of Angola.

136
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:24,310
Suddenly I'm Buddha,
became an oil juggernaut selling tons of

137
00:07:24,311 --> 00:07:27,910
dinosaur juice to China in the United 
States in just five years.

138
00:07:27,911 --> 00:07:30,760
I can go to the multiplied by four

139
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,070
and go let's.
Capital was being rebuilt.

140
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:34,233
The varied architecture from the fifties
and sixties is giving way to new office 

141
00:07:38,051 --> 00:07:38,884
towers that are being built between the 
national corporate sector and then and 

142
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,443
government

143
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:44,453
companies like Exxon mobile in the U.
S or bp and the UK invested heavily in 

144
00:07:48,151 --> 00:07:52,440
Angola and of course they sent engineers
and workers to live in the capital.

145
00:07:52,450 --> 00:07:56,130
All the little ones up and of course 
these people wanted good quality houses,

146
00:07:56,131 --> 00:07:59,460
cool bars and these same kinds of goods 
that they could fly back home.

147
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,370
But all of those things that have the 
fines in the country that years,

148
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:04,890
the fort was having a big old civil war.
In other words,

149
00:08:04,891 --> 00:08:07,040
the supply was small man's yet the 
demand.

150
00:08:07,070 --> 00:08:09,000
We didn't stop growing.
As a result,

151
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:13,650
the prices of Western goods went 
absolutely sky high,

152
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:14,803
built for 500,000 people.
The angerland capitalists now 

153
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,373
accommodating an estimated 5 million.
Even civil servants with comfortable 

154
00:08:23,391 --> 00:08:24,224
salaries have

155
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,880
well making ends meet was wait just a 
minute because there's more.

156
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:28,803
Imagine we have a construction company 
in China and we want to build a housing 

157
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:32,830
block in new enza.
Well,

158
00:08:32,831 --> 00:08:35,130
the first thing we want to do is 
register a company,

159
00:08:35,550 --> 00:08:36,440
right?
Well,

160
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:39,190
that process can take six months during 
that time.

161
00:08:39,191 --> 00:08:40,024
That's perfectly normal that the 
government fines and lots of problems 

162
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,620
and they ask me for this paper,
that registry,

163
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:45,633
and that's how the report that you 
probably don't have the sort of report 

164
00:08:48,971 --> 00:08:52,170
that a nice stack of cash and they do a 
sweaty palm under a table,

165
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,013
could probably

166
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:54,770
and

167
00:08:57,250 --> 00:08:58,083
does have a reports made by 
organizations like Transparency 

168
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:01,983
International.
Almost every company who does business 

169
00:09:03,821 --> 00:09:06,910
in Angola has had to do with some sort 
of bribery.

170
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:07,803
The government's official,
but wait just a minute because this is 

171
00:09:10,271 --> 00:09:11,350
still not the end of it.

172
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,253
Those oil companies like Exxon Mobil or 
British Petroleum that we're willing to 

173
00:09:15,051 --> 00:09:15,884
do business in Angola as they were,
had to establish partnerships with the 

174
00:09:19,071 --> 00:09:21,530
government or so and goal the Angola 
state

175
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:22,683
company

176
00:09:26,550 --> 00:09:28,620
now have a guest who is the head of that
company.

177
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:29,131
Well,
and yes,

178
00:09:29,131 --> 00:09:30,600
that was all friend we mentioned 
earlier,

179
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:33,390
Isabelle dos Santos,
the daughter of the former presidents of

180
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:34,224
the country.
This explains why Isabelle tell became 

181
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:39,030
the wealthiest women in Africa in so

182
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,043
every major Angolan investment held by 
dos Santos stemmed from taking a chunk 

183
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:48,424
of a company that wants to do business 
in the country or from a stroke of the 

184
00:09:51,041 --> 00:09:53,350
president's pen that cut her into the 
action

185
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,430
for all of this.
On the governments have dos Santos,

186
00:09:55,431 --> 00:09:59,120
the father of restricted access to the 
country for international journalists.

187
00:09:59,121 --> 00:10:01,070
In fact,
most of the corruption scandals,

188
00:10:01,071 --> 00:10:04,750
we know what else I've been discovered 
by the governments of the US.

189
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:06,103
Okay.

190
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:11,270
Of course,
with a political kind of like this,

191
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,170
no,
I can go then wanted to start a company,

192
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,033
but at the end of the day,
the reality was that you needed to be a 

193
00:10:15,451 --> 00:10:17,640
millionaire in order to pay those 
barriers.

194
00:10:17,641 --> 00:10:20,700
Brian's men's.
Even if we would put the cost of bribery

195
00:10:20,701 --> 00:10:21,534
aside just with the basic bureaucracy,
you need a thousand US dollars to start 

196
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:26,394
a normal bar in windsor in the country,
as poor as I can get under a thousand 

197
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:30,743
dollars isn't absolutely not only that,
these international companies were not 

198
00:10:36,031 --> 00:10:39,660
willing to invest in the country more 
than the absolute minimum required

199
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:40,613
to extract the oil.
So now you might wonder what were the 

200
00:10:42,751 --> 00:10:43,584
consequences of all this well outcome is
that dinosaur juice is the only and 

201
00:10:47,491 --> 00:10:48,324
Golan export back in the last decade,
the only new and Golan businesses were 

202
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:57,240
crude oil extraction plants and houses 
for its workers.

203
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:02,220
By the year 2014 oil represented 97 
percent of end goal exports.

204
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,730
No.

205
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:08,053
This point,
if you're a regular visual politic via 

206
00:11:09,140 --> 00:11:11,480
you might be thinking,
this sounds pretty familiar to me.

207
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,900
That's probably because you've seen on 
videos on Venezuela,

208
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:17,390
a country with a similar economic 
system.

209
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:18,740
John's like,
what happens in Nicolas?

210
00:11:18,741 --> 00:11:22,320
Maduro has country.
When the oil market price went down,

211
00:11:22,321 --> 00:11:26,480
then Garla went right along with it.
So now let's get onto the example of the

212
00:11:26,481 --> 00:11:27,314
Chinese construction companies.
Many companies from China invested 

213
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:30,523
millions building entire neighborhoods,
facts that professionals coming to the 

214
00:11:33,321 --> 00:11:34,154
country,
but now there's no more oil industry 

215
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:38,600
then therefore there's no more workers.

216
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,733
Four lane highways without cause schools
with no pupils and under five years a 

217
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:48,930
Chinese company built Columbia using oil
credit lines with China,

218
00:11:49,590 --> 00:11:53,290
but parts of Columbia,
I feel like a ghost town in summary,

219
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:54,400
that is only

220
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,233
one winner in that story,
and that person is who sandwell dude or 

221
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,293
Santos and his daughter Isabelle,
who has already invested these enormous 

222
00:12:01,931 --> 00:12:02,764
profits overseas.
Most of the big Portuguese firms from 

223
00:12:05,381 --> 00:12:09,250
galp to Unitel.
Now under the control of this family.

224
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:11,920
If Portugal was a colonizer in the past,
well,

225
00:12:11,921 --> 00:12:12,754
they've now become Angola's money 
launderer out and golden elites have 

226
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:20,200
sent an estimated $119,000,000,000 out 
of the country.

227
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:22,780
And while the entire country is having a
crisis,

228
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:23,643
Isabelle dos Santos,
who identifies herself as entrepreneur 

229
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:27,303
on our twitter account,
goes out with celebrities like Kim 

230
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,200
called Dashi,
and all of this being said,

231
00:12:32,201 --> 00:12:35,800
you might have guessed the dos Santos 
family is not that popular here.

232
00:12:35,801 --> 00:12:36,634
Now you go there,

233
00:12:36,870 --> 00:12:37,703
right?

234
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:42,760
Really,
in fact,

235
00:12:42,761 --> 00:12:43,594
that political party,
the MPLA keeps stealing the show 

236
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:46,773
election after election getting over 70 
percent of the votes this past August 

237
00:12:50,951 --> 00:12:54,640
2017.
Angola held an electric despite the fact

238
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,760
that juice Eduardo Dot Santos was not a 
does anymore.

239
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:01,330
His party at one end game.
I'm so now you might be wondering,

240
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,500
well,
why does this happen?

241
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,393
Well,
I'm afraid that we're probably never 

242
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:09,871
going to need rejects.
EU election observers.

243
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,910
And now the question really becomes,
is it going to be possible for Angola to

244
00:13:13,911 --> 00:13:14,744
get rid of this corrupt ruling class?
Can lead follow the trends of those 

245
00:13:17,841 --> 00:13:20,010
African lions like gone or older ones 
that.

246
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:20,893
