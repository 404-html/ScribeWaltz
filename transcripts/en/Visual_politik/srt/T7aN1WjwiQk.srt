1
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:05,190
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,373
so a few weeks ago,
I told you the story of the Tokyo 

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:13,660
Olympics in 2020 and all the problems 
that they're facing,

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,653
any of the Olympic Games are one of the 
most expensive events that a city can 

5
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:18,550
host.
Nonetheless,

6
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:23,050
usually city hauls go crazy to get a 
chance to organize the limbics.

7
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:23,973
Usually they always have the support of 
their national governments and their 

8
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:32,310
citizens.
In fact,

9
00:00:32,541 --> 00:00:33,374
each time they'd make a survey,
most of the people are happy about 

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,470
hosting the Olympic Games.
The main opinion is that's an event.

11
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,313
It's lengthy.
Olympics brings a lot of good into the 

12
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:44,150
country.
It increases tourism.

13
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:44,984
The host city gets renovators and the 
country becomes fashionable attracting 

14
00:00:48,051 --> 00:00:50,900
investors and businessmen from all over 
the world.

15
00:00:51,020 --> 00:00:53,180
Well,
if you've seen our video about Tokyo,

16
00:00:53,390 --> 00:00:56,450
you know that this isn't exactly true.
In fact,

17
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,300
the Olympics can create big problems in 
Japan,

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:04,160
might end up going bankrupt from going 
so far over budget.

19
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:09,213
In fact,
we can say that is a big debate about 

20
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:13,480
whether it's goods or bad.
It's a host,

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:15,220
the Olympic Games,
and guess what?

22
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:16,203
The Olympic excitements is not exactly 
having its best hour until 2012 each 

23
00:01:20,441 --> 00:01:24,700
time the International Olympic Committee
met to choose the next host city.

24
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:27,730
There were around five candidates.
However,

25
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,380
the 2024 games had just two candidates,
Los Angeles and Paris.

26
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,263
Yes.

27
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:41,630
Many capitals like boot of hash or Rome 
retired their bid at the last minute and

28
00:01:41,631 --> 00:01:42,464
others like Hamburg and Germany organize
a referendum or citizens voted against 

29
00:01:46,491 --> 00:01:48,380
hosting the Olympics.
Yes,

30
00:01:48,381 --> 00:01:49,214
you heard that right?
There is the general disappointments 

31
00:01:50,961 --> 00:01:51,794
about the Olympics and this might be a 
big problem for the International 

32
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,620
Olympic Committee if nobody wants to 
host.

33
00:01:57,621 --> 00:01:58,454
I mean what could happen to the future 
of the Olympic Games and the bigger 

34
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,080
question of course is,
well,

35
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:03,973
is this the end of the Olympics spirits?
So what could we do to keep the Olympic 

36
00:02:08,001 --> 00:02:09,230
flame burning?
Well,

37
00:02:09,231 --> 00:02:11,080
today we're going to answer those 
questions,

38
00:02:11,081 --> 00:02:13,000
but before we do that is take a look 
back at the history.

39
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:13,843
Great.

40
00:02:16,850 --> 00:02:17,683
Vic Breakfast.
I'm sure that every one of you knows 

41
00:02:19,641 --> 00:02:22,370
that the Olympic Games work she did in 
ancient Greece,

42
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:23,204
but the truth is that the muzzle 
Olympics has nothing to do with Mount 

43
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:26,893
Olympus.
It really started in the 1896 with a 

44
00:02:28,581 --> 00:02:31,040
French born baron named Pierre to cook a
tall,

45
00:02:31,130 --> 00:02:33,710
along with a Greek man named evangelist 
Zapper.

46
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:34,603
They convince the Greek government to 
organize some games the same way that 

47
00:02:36,951 --> 00:02:40,310
the ancient Greeks sat back then,
nationalism was high in Greece,

48
00:02:40,311 --> 00:02:41,144
so everything that helps to inflame the 
national pride was seen as a good idea 

49
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:45,614
by the government.
This is how the first modern Olympics 

50
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:50,750
we're organized in Athens.
Nonetheless,

51
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,673
he had to keep,
it all had bigger plans than simple 

52
00:02:53,331 --> 00:02:57,320
nationalist propaganda.
This could be an international events.

53
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,810
What's in order to achieve this?
The host city had to rotate.

54
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,670
This is how the International Olympic 
Committee also known as I oh c was born.

55
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:10,803
The IOC is an organization responsible 
for ensuring that every four years we 

56
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:16,540
have the winter Olympics,
the summer Olympics,

57
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:18,550
and the Paralympics.
Put it another way.

58
00:03:18,551 --> 00:03:22,840
This committee's mission is to promote 
sports and tolerance among nations.

59
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:27,580
And this was a pretty wonderful idea,
but do hold on for just a second because

60
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:30,340
we are just getting started with our 
story.

61
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,353
The first Olympic Games were pretty 
modest events that were organized next 

62
00:03:33,851 --> 00:03:34,684
to international exhibitions,
but things really changed in the year 

63
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:38,980
1936

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,373
okay.

65
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,120
As you know,
back then,

66
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,070
Nazi Germany,
well,

67
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,973
they were about to start their world 
conquest to this end is they needed to 

68
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:51,604
improve that image abroad and is the 
idea of wrapping themselves with the 

69
00:03:54,131 --> 00:03:54,964
flag of sports excellence and tolerance 
between nations sounded like heaven to 

70
00:03:58,601 --> 00:03:59,434
the ears of adult headlock and this is 
why the Bellin Olympic Games in 1936 

71
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:07,060
became the first Olympic super reduction
in history.

72
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:10,720
It cost more than 30 million US dollars 
at the time,

73
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,810
and that was an insane amount of money 
back in the day.

74
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:14,733
The precedent for hosted cities 
overspending on the Olympic Games while 

75
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:19,540
it all came from Nazi Germany.

76
00:04:26,730 --> 00:04:27,563
Okay.

77
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:34,460
But the first big economic catastrophe,
well that came many years later with the

78
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,870
Montreal Olympics in 1976

79
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,833
those games ended up costing eight times
more than the initial budget and they 

80
00:04:41,981 --> 00:04:42,814
had lasting financial consequences.
Canada didn't finish paying the debt in 

81
00:04:46,231 --> 00:04:47,064
incurred to finance those games until 
2006 they even had to create a new 

82
00:04:51,251 --> 00:04:54,050
special tax for tobacco in order to 
cover the costs.

83
00:04:57,370 --> 00:04:59,110
I'm the story here.
It's really simple.

84
00:04:59,111 --> 00:05:02,320
I mean there were lots of cities who 
want to host the Olympics,

85
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:05,830
but first they need to be chosen by the 
IOC.

86
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:08,590
And as you can imagine,
the more you are willing to spend,

87
00:05:08,591 --> 00:05:10,900
the higher your chances of winning the 
bid.

88
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:11,973
And listen,
I can probably guess what you're 

89
00:05:12,821 --> 00:05:13,654
thinking right now.
Why is money that's important to the 

90
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,310
International Olympic Committee?
Do you know what I mean?

91
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:21,220
Didn't we just say that what matters 
here is the tolerance,

92
00:05:21,221 --> 00:05:23,800
the excellence and the sports.
Well,

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:24,970
yeah,
you are right,

94
00:05:24,971 --> 00:05:25,804
but the budget is not the only element 
that the IOC takes into account when it 

95
00:05:28,751 --> 00:05:29,584
chooses a host sissy.
There are plenty of other factors that 

96
00:05:32,261 --> 00:05:33,130
they need to keep in mind.

97
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,490
Okay.

98
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:41,960
Bribery scandal threatens to shrink 2002
Winter Games,

99
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,170
man,
that is just one example.

100
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:47,380
According to the AISC manual,
each time they visit one candidate city,

101
00:05:47,381 --> 00:05:48,214
the town hall must pay for a four or 
five star hotel and international 

102
00:05:51,011 --> 00:05:54,430
breakfast and luxury private cars for 
each of their members.

103
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,323
And yes,
this is actually specified in the 

104
00:05:57,320 --> 00:06:00,110
guidelines and listen,
according to recent investigations,

105
00:06:00,111 --> 00:06:00,944
the parties that are held to entertain 
the IOC members would pretty much make 

106
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:07,250
Berlusconi's orgies look like Sunday 
mass.

107
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:08,223
All right,
so you might think that with that last 

108
00:06:09,051 --> 00:06:10,730
statement,
I'm exaggerating a little,

109
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:12,070
but really I,
I

110
00:06:12,250 --> 00:06:13,083
no

111
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,713
to IOC members accepted offers of 
prostitution from the Amsterdam 

112
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:27,610
Committee that bid for the 1992 summer 
games.

113
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,673
As you can see,
it's not like the IOC members live like 

114
00:06:30,211 --> 00:06:31,170
rockstars.
Indeed,

115
00:06:31,171 --> 00:06:34,470
I would say that rock stars who wished 
they lived like IOC members.

116
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:35,803
Well,
do you know what the best parts of all 

117
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:37,914
of this as well,
their organization makes millions of 

118
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:41,183
dollars every year,
but they aren't even registered as a 

119
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,334
company.
The IOC is technically a nonprofit 

120
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:48,390
organization headquartered in 
Switzerland.

121
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:50,670
All right,
so what does that actually mean?

122
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,593
Well,
essentially it means that they don't 

123
00:06:52,561 --> 00:06:55,710
need to pay taxes and they can use all 
kinds of strategies.

124
00:06:55,711 --> 00:06:57,420
Do you honey their accounting book?
Well,

125
00:06:57,430 --> 00:06:58,263
it essentially means that they don't 
need to pay taxes and they can use all 

126
00:07:00,661 --> 00:07:03,420
kinds of strategies.
Do you hype their accounting books?

127
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:07,930
Yeah.

128
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:08,763
Now you may remember that we previously 
did a video about e sports where we 

129
00:07:11,141 --> 00:07:14,740
talked about Formula One Formula One.
While that's a publicly traded company,

130
00:07:14,741 --> 00:07:15,574
and that's why on visual politic we 
could give you accurate numbers for how 

131
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:20,470
much money they make.
With the Olympics.

132
00:07:20,530 --> 00:07:22,690
It's far,
far more difficult.

133
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,553
You can make estimations based on how 
much they charge for the broadcasting 

134
00:07:26,501 --> 00:07:27,760
rights are.
That's,

135
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:29,860
that's pretty much it.
So now you may be wondering,

136
00:07:29,890 --> 00:07:30,723
why am I sticking quite so much on how 
much money the IOC actually makes look 

137
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,533
vast?
Because when somebody has a good income 

138
00:07:36,611 --> 00:07:37,444
and almost no spending,
I mean don't forget that the Games are 

139
00:07:39,131 --> 00:07:41,560
pretty much paid almost entirely by 
local governments.

140
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:45,190
Well.
Then you can invest in things like this.

141
00:07:49,110 --> 00:07:49,943
Astroturfing is the practice of masking 
the sponsors of a message or 

142
00:07:53,671 --> 00:07:55,560
organization.
For example,

143
00:07:55,561 --> 00:07:59,130
political advertising,
religious or public relations to make it

144
00:07:59,131 --> 00:08:04,131
appear as though it originates from and 
is supported by grassroots participants.

145
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,873
In other words,
you can pay for things like the Olympic 

146
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:08,204
studies centers,
which have a presence in several 

147
00:08:10,231 --> 00:08:11,064
universities all around the globe.
That job is basically to produce 

148
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:14,544
academic research to prove with 
scientific research and data that 

149
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:20,490
hosting the Olympics is as good as 
winning the lottery.

150
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:22,860
But listen,
this is not the end of the story here.

151
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,210
I told you some of the reasons why a 
city is chosen to host the Olympic,

152
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:28,740
but this is still not the end of our 
story today.

153
00:08:28,741 --> 00:08:31,980
I told you some of the reasons 
previously why a city would be chosen to

154
00:08:31,981 --> 00:08:33,360
host the Olympics.
Well,

155
00:08:33,420 --> 00:08:37,200
another one is what they call the 
Olympic feeling among the citizens.

156
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,183
This means how much people in the city 
or country are actually in favor of 

157
00:08:42,001 --> 00:08:42,834
hosting the Games.
So if you're watching this video from 

158
00:08:44,341 --> 00:08:45,174
London,
you probably have some idea of what I'm 

159
00:08:46,771 --> 00:08:47,640
talking about.
I mean,

160
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:49,920
all of a sudden the local media is 
talking about it,

161
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:50,754
your friends,
but the Olympic logo on their facebook 

162
00:08:52,441 --> 00:08:54,960
profile picture,
and it's almost impossible.

163
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,410
Find critics on any talk show.

164
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:02,583
I mean,
it's really in the interest of the 

165
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:07,420
entire governments and the sponsors to 
silence all of the discordant voices.

166
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:09,250
So this is probably why this happens.
And then,

167
00:09:09,251 --> 00:09:10,084
I mean,
what's the conclusion we can draw from 

168
00:09:11,081 --> 00:09:12,010
all of this?
Well,

169
00:09:12,011 --> 00:09:12,844
in a city like Madrid,
more than 85% of citizens wanted the 

170
00:09:16,540 --> 00:09:20,260
Olympic Games according to a survey.
And a similar thing happens in Tokyo and

171
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,123
in pretty much any other host city.
So all of this explains partly the rush 

172
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,440
to organize the Olympics that pretty 
much any cost.

173
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,333
Japan has already announced that they 
were spending over 20 billion United 

174
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:31,563
States dollars for that Tokyo Olympics 
in 2020 Rio de Janeiro in 2012 costs 

175
00:09:36,011 --> 00:09:39,490
more than $12 billion for the Brazilian 
taxpayer.

176
00:09:39,730 --> 00:09:41,020
And then there's grease.
I mean,

177
00:09:41,021 --> 00:09:43,480
that's still paying their debts from 
Athens.

178
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:47,430
And 2004 nonetheless though things they 
aren't changing.

179
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,323
Sure.

180
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,350
Is there any future for the Olympics?
As we said before,

181
00:09:58,351 --> 00:10:01,050
in the nineties and the first decade of 
this century,

182
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:04,980
anytime the IOC and match,
there were around five candidate cities.

183
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:05,843
Nonetheless in the vote for the Olympics
in 2020 the one that Tokyo one there 

184
00:10:09,151 --> 00:10:12,930
were just three candidates in the last 
two beds for the Olympics.

185
00:10:12,931 --> 00:10:13,764
2024 and 2028 there wasn't even a single
vote because there was only one 

186
00:10:18,510 --> 00:10:21,060
candidate city,
Los Angeles in one case,

187
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:25,080
and Paris in the other cities like Rome,
Budapest in Stockholm,

188
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:26,003
which once bid for the Olympics have 
already simply retired from the race 

189
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,850
bay.
Just don't think it's worth

190
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:31,783
money.

191
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:36,753
And to all of those economists who were 
once silenced while they're starting to 

192
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:41,240
appear in the media.
Meanwhile,

193
00:10:41,260 --> 00:10:42,093
the An indie games,
sir losing a lot of their appeal for 

194
00:10:43,971 --> 00:10:44,804
audiences,
there are less and less viewers every 

195
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,400
time it runs.
Platforms like Netflix,

196
00:10:49,401 --> 00:10:50,234
HBO,
or even indeed Youtube are becoming big 

197
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,813
competition for traditional television.
This means that by the time it Tokyo 

198
00:10:55,851 --> 00:10:56,684
2020 years health,
many of you will be watching a TV show 

199
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:03,200
or official politic video instead of the
synchronized swimming competition.

200
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,093
And so well now you might be wondering,
well how did the International Olympic 

201
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,860
Committee react to this?
Well,

202
00:11:09,861 --> 00:11:11,810
the answer is probably going to 
disappoint you,

203
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:12,644
but I see it.
Yeah.

204
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,960
Ioc Agenda 2020 allows the Olympics in 
different host countries.

205
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:24,320
I mean,
I'm not saying this is a bad idea,

206
00:11:24,321 --> 00:11:25,154
but it does make little sense if your 
goal is to reduce wasted money when 

207
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,690
organizing the Olympic Games.
I mean,

208
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,553
yeah,
it is good now that the spending could 

209
00:11:31,791 --> 00:11:35,090
be divided among the taxpayers have two 
different countries,

210
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:37,580
but then also have twice as many venues 
as before.

211
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:41,450
So in other words,
it's not actually that great of an idea.

212
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:42,373
Now,
wait just a second here because this is 

213
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:44,474
not the only proposal you see lately.
There's a movement that suggesting 

214
00:11:47,481 --> 00:11:51,920
something a bit more revolutionary.
They wanted to get rid of city rotation.

215
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:56,353
This would mean that the Olympic Games 
would always be organized in the same 

216
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:02,750
city this way,
which is neat to buy one stadium and one

217
00:12:02,751 --> 00:12:05,870
Olympic villa that could be reused every
single time.

218
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,793
Some economists like Andrew's Marlis 
suggest Los Angeles is the perfect city 

219
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:11,053
to become the eternal Olympic host.
It's big enough they have an 

220
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:14,624
international airport and they can 
receive all the tourists and they also 

221
00:12:17,421 --> 00:12:19,160
have a pretty solid media industry.

222
00:12:19,380 --> 00:12:20,213
The solution has a problem.
If there is no competition among cities 

223
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:28,500
to host the Olympics and the IOC would 
lose its negotiating leverage,

224
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:33,673
be no incentive to bribe or provide 
luxury to IOC leaders and sooner or 

225
00:12:38,541 --> 00:12:39,374
later Los Angeles or some other city 
that would become the permanent host 

226
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,693
would start demanding things like a 
greater share of the money from the 

227
00:12:46,161 --> 00:12:46,994
broadcasting.
Right.

228
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:51,353
So now the question comes around too.
Do you think the International Olympic 

229
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,253
Committee,
we'll find an alternative solution to 

230
00:12:56,581 --> 00:12:57,414
get back their lost prestige or perhaps 
we will see the ends of the Olympic 

231
00:13:01,410 --> 00:13:02,370
Games as we know it's,
well,
