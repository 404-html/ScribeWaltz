1
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,720
Romania might be the first country in 
the world to legalized corruption.

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:13,310
Yes.
You heard that writes,

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:14,203
in January 2017,
the Romanian parliaments passed an 

4
00:00:16,611 --> 00:00:19,370
ordinance which allow politicians to 
accept bribes,

5
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:20,323
have almost $50,000.
These bribes can happen without any 

6
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,570
kinds of legal repercussions whatsoever.
Now,

7
00:00:26,571 --> 00:00:29,240
as you can imagine,
this infamous ordinance triggered one of

8
00:00:29,241 --> 00:00:30,074
the biggest political demonstrations 
that the country has seen for over 20 

9
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:38,921
years just to the government suspending 
them temporarily,

10
00:00:42,501 --> 00:00:45,770
but even after this protests continued 
Romanians role,

11
00:00:45,860 --> 00:00:48,100
the used to living in Europe's most 
corrupt country,

12
00:00:48,130 --> 00:00:52,640
and this ignominious decree was the 
final straw that broke the camel's back.

13
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:54,770
But the big question is,
how did they get to this point?

14
00:00:54,771 --> 00:00:55,604
So what's going on in a country that 
could make its governments passed this 

15
00:00:58,101 --> 00:01:00,920
cleans of law without feeling any sort 
of shape?

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:01,873
Well,
today we're going to answer this 

17
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:04,250
question.
Before we do that.

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:09,430
Let's take a look at the history.
The European,

19
00:01:10,771 --> 00:01:11,320
North Korea.

20
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:12,153
Maria,

21
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,160
understand Romanian history without 
knowing it out,

22
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:17,290
Nicolae Ceausescu,
the European,

23
00:01:17,291 --> 00:01:18,124
Kim Jong.
Now other neighboring countries like 

24
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:28,080
Hungary or Bulgaria have suffered 
communist dictatorships too.

25
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,970
But the story of Romania is quite 
special since Ceausescu came to power in

26
00:01:32,971 --> 00:01:33,804
1974,
his country has been isolated from the 

27
00:01:35,941 --> 00:01:38,460
rest and even from the Soviet Union 
itself.

28
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,860
Can even food started to become scary.

29
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,043
Yes.

30
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:46,430
While citizens had the meals rations by 
the state Ceausescu,

31
00:01:46,431 --> 00:01:49,040
it spends money building Pharaoh's 
palaces.

32
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,340
For instance,
here is the parliaments of Bucharest.

33
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:52,183
The built in 1983 ends and names of the 
biggest administrative building in the 

34
00:01:55,401 --> 00:01:56,234
entire world.
This is especially amazing if we take 

35
00:01:58,941 --> 00:01:59,774
into account is that the Romanian 
population is no bigger than 22 million 

36
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:06,110
inhabitants during the construction of 
the building.

37
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:09,350
More than 20,000 people were employed in
the reynolds.

38
00:02:09,351 --> 00:02:12,700
3,000 died of exhaustion,
but not only that,

39
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,180
Ceausescu forced as citizens to 
participate in parades and massive shows

40
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,010
to praise his own image.

41
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,500
Are they chicken activist?
I've met yet.

42
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:33,880
It's

43
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,713
just like is North Korea and comrades.
Ceausescu was a master in the art of 

44
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,050
political repression during the 19 
eighties,

45
00:02:41,110 --> 00:02:46,110
an estimate of one in every 30 Romanians
along stevie political police.

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:51,020
It could be a neighbor your or anyone 
really leaning any solid.

47
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,873
You said something bad about the leader,
you could end up spending the rest of 

48
00:02:55,121 --> 00:02:59,170
your days in jail simply just disappear 
nonetheless,

49
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:02,820
despite all of this being a dictator,
it's not a safe.

50
00:03:02,950 --> 00:03:03,783
Joel

51
00:03:06,950 --> 00:03:07,783
footage is from Ceausescu's last speech 
which took place on the 21st of 

52
00:03:10,971 --> 00:03:13,130
December,
1989 look good.

53
00:03:13,131 --> 00:03:16,220
His facial expression and how it starts 
to tremble.

54
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:19,160
It was at this moment the audience 
started

55
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:20,503
him.

56
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,050
This is how the biggest protest in 
Romanian history started.

57
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:28,913
Thousands of citizens stepped out on the
streets with national flags or the 

58
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,933
Communists symbols had been cut out.
Three days later on Christmas Day of 

59
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:37,600
that year,
Nikolai,

60
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:42,150
coca school died next to his wife,
killed by his own party colleagues.

61
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:47,240
His last words were history will,
and so now you might be wondering,

62
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,000
well,
what happens next?

63
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:56,870
The truth is in such an oppressive 
regime is Ceausescu's.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,760
There were no opposition leaders 
whatsoever.

65
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:03,060
Just to make a comparison in Poland's 
when the communist regime fell,

66
00:04:03,090 --> 00:04:05,270
there were powerful leaders like Les 
Waylay,

67
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,530
some popular support and helps write a 
brand new constitution for the country.

68
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,513
Nevertheless,
who do you think succeeded Ceausescu in 

69
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,770
Romania?
Well,

70
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,790
what would be his own party comrades 
more?

71
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,560
Exactly.
That would be the man who you see on the

72
00:04:19,561 --> 00:04:20,394
screen now and his name is young.
Imagine this government was not willing 

73
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:33,030
to give up the luxuries that they had 
during Ceausescu's times,

74
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:36,200
so I was always happens in cases like 
this.

75
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,470
The Romanian regime changed,
but just a little,

76
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,363
of course,
the new constitution allow the other 

77
00:04:41,691 --> 00:04:42,524
parties to run for elections and the old
communist party changed its name to the 

78
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:47,623
Social Democratic Party,
but the high ranking officials that 

79
00:04:48,681 --> 00:04:49,514
ruled the country during the 
dictatorship caps that power during the 

80
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:55,820
19 nineties and two thousands.
So as you probably know,

81
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:59,240
if power corrupts,
absolute power corrupts absolutely.

82
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,950
That's understanding of this.
In 1995,

83
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:10,060
50 percent of the Polish economy was 
already in private hands.

84
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,680
But in Romania this figure was only 35 
percent.

85
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,450
So that's something like,
as an example,

86
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:21,340
let's take two common terrorists.
Czechoslovakia had a state owned factory

87
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,203
Skoda that was privatized in 1992.
By sharing the ownership among the 

88
00:05:26,261 --> 00:05:28,330
workers,
it's Romanian counterpart.

89
00:05:28,370 --> 00:05:33,370
Dacia was not privatized until 1997 and 
instead of doing it by sharing it,

90
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,190
it was simply sold to Renner.
In other words,

91
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:37,780
during the nineties and the two 
thousands,

92
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,633
the ruling elite in Romania did whatever
they could in order to keep control of 

93
00:05:42,311 --> 00:05:43,144
the economy and the country.
It was only through these actions that 

94
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,791
they were able to keep a hold on that.
Wait,

95
00:05:58,201 --> 00:06:01,020
just a second tip,
because corruption was presence at lower

96
00:06:01,021 --> 00:06:04,590
levels as well in the country that had 
been so used to scarcity,

97
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:08,520
it was impossible to get anything 
without a little brian.

98
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,080
I want to go to the doctor.
Well,

99
00:06:10,081 --> 00:06:14,070
bring a box of cigarettes with you and 
what about to have electricity at home?

100
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
A whiskey bottle bends everything sorted
out and that is how in this country 

101
00:06:18,751 --> 00:06:20,390
corruption became a way of life

102
00:06:20,490 --> 00:06:21,360
life.

103
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:25,803
Now you might be wondering,
is it really possible for a country to 

104
00:06:28,391 --> 00:06:31,790
work this way?
And the answer is well no.

105
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,790
Remaining and saw how the former 
communist republic,

106
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,700
such as the Czech Republic,
Poland,

107
00:06:36,701 --> 00:06:41,080
started enjoying a western standard of 
living while they kept surviving on less

108
00:06:41,081 --> 00:06:41,914
than $400 a month.
This is why in the middle of 2000 

109
00:06:44,630 --> 00:06:45,463
Romania requested you become a member of
the European Union so that they could 

110
00:06:48,831 --> 00:06:49,664
get access to some of those sweet,
sweet EU funds and Brussels basically 

111
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,710
said,
okay man,

112
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:55,603
I'll let you in,
but there's one condition and that 

113
00:06:57,921 --> 00:06:58,754
condition was the national 
anticorruption directorate in the year 

114
00:07:05,231 --> 00:07:06,064
2002,
the Romanian government founded an 

115
00:07:07,781 --> 00:07:08,614
agency to chase corruption.
The national anticorruption direct 

116
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:12,664
service for its best few years.
This agency was directed by prosecutors 

117
00:07:16,091 --> 00:07:16,924
connected to the party leaders,
so this was basically the Romanian way 

118
00:07:19,661 --> 00:07:20,494
of saying,
hey,

119
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:22,410
look at us.
We're doing great liquid.

120
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,450
All this corruption we're tackling with 
cleaning up everything.

121
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:27,790
But then again,
not surprisingly,

122
00:07:27,791 --> 00:07:32,791
nothing changed.
That was until the year 2013,

123
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:39,960
that is the year when a woman came to 
Leeds,

124
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:40,794
the director of risk,
a women ready to face everything and 

125
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:47,760
every one and her name is Laura Cod.
Router pervasy

126
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,090
seemed to have been impressed by the 
activities of the DNA.

127
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,133
According to one recent poll,
60 percent of people said they trusted 

128
00:08:00,901 --> 00:08:01,734
the agency while only 11 percent say 
they trusted problem in just two years 

129
00:08:05,731 --> 00:08:08,030
because they see his jails more than 
1000.

130
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:11,540
100 politicians accused of corruption 
during these years.

131
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,413
Romanians have discovered all of the 
dirty things that ruling class were 

132
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:19,710
hiding and these are no small things.
According to an estimate,

133
00:08:19,711 --> 00:08:24,090
corruption accounts for 15 percent of 
Romanian GDP.

134
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:28,290
Virtually all the public sales had some 
kind of running involved.

135
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,273
Even the Microsoft licenses that the 
civil servants used has a cost of over 

136
00:08:32,521 --> 00:08:33,780
$3,
million dollars,

137
00:08:33,781 --> 00:08:37,020
which we use to pay bribes to different 
government officials.

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:43,033
Then there was the case of a judge who 
was paint around $700,000 in order to 

139
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:51,320
declare someone innocent.
He was actually guilty and this list,

140
00:08:51,321 --> 00:08:52,154
it just goes on and on and on,
and I don't want to make that the rest 

141
00:08:54,231 --> 00:08:57,030
of this video,
but since the year 2013,

142
00:08:57,031 --> 00:08:57,864
basically all of these criminals,
they've been filling up the Romanian 

143
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,924
jails.
To the point that some of the prisons 

144
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,474
have no space anymore,
but not only that Romanian society 

145
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:10,680
itself has started to realize just how 
damaging corruption is,

146
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:15,180
but the real turning points came a 
little bit later with this news.

147
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,113
Armenian nightclub fire leaves 27 dead.
This news triggered a wave of protests 

148
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:23,663
all across Romania.
Apparently this could have been avoided 

149
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,160
if the club would have met safety 
regulations.

150
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:31,860
That seems the owner,
red bribes the local authorities.

151
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:34,590
He could open the club without breaking 
the rules.

152
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,453
This is how a platform came to be called
the corrupted cheat day or corruption 

153
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:40,254
kills in English through social media.
Romanian started to organize themselves 

154
00:09:44,161 --> 00:09:46,830
in protest groups against corruption.
Oh,

155
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:49,470
but just hold on for a minute because 
the best.

156
00:09:49,471 --> 00:09:50,304
It's really yet to come.
The biggest demonstrations in Romanian 

157
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:59,870
history on January the 18th,
2017 at 10:00 PM.

158
00:09:59,871 --> 00:10:03,320
The social democratic government and 
it's prime minister does or in grinned.

159
00:10:03,321 --> 00:10:06,500
Deanna passed an emergency.
Bill Pan's.

160
00:10:06,501 --> 00:10:07,334
Yes,
they did do it at night when everyone 

161
00:10:08,691 --> 00:10:12,500
was about to go to bed.
So what did this decrease say?

162
00:10:12,770 --> 00:10:13,603
Well,
it said the politicians who accepted 

163
00:10:14,811 --> 00:10:19,280
bribes for less than 44,000 euros did 
not have to face jail time,

164
00:10:19,281 --> 00:10:22,100
more pay any fines,
nothing at all.

165
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:25,820
It was absolutely fine with the law to 
be bribed up to that.

166
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:26,843
No.

167
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:32,400
It should also be noted that they 
discussed this little welder beating the

168
00:10:32,401 --> 00:10:36,120
national budget as normal so no one 
would notice the change.

169
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:40,800
So now you might be wondering who can 
possibly data passed such a law.

170
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,753
I mean,
what could possibly be the official 

171
00:10:43,351 --> 00:10:46,620
reason behind the decriminalization of 
embroidery?

172
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,110
Well,
this is the reason given by the Romanian

173
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,944
prime minister

174
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:56,900
wants to pass the ordinances into law to
ease overcrowding in prisons.

175
00:10:57,050 --> 00:10:57,883
Yes,
this was the actual reason given by the 

176
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:03,830
Romanian government and Bam,
just like that.

177
00:11:03,890 --> 00:11:07,620
Over 3000 corrupt politicians could be 
freed and he has.

178
00:11:07,650 --> 00:11:08,483
Well,
it is true that remaining jails were 

179
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:10,223
overcrowded,
is in a country where money is drained 

180
00:11:11,811 --> 00:11:12,644
from the system by bribery.
It shouldn't be too difficult to find 

181
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,810
new funds for new prisons.
Also,

182
00:11:17,811 --> 00:11:19,490
the fact that the majority of the 
generals,

183
00:11:19,491 --> 00:11:21,240
politicians belong to the government 
pass.

184
00:11:21,250 --> 00:11:24,200
It does make it slightly more 
suspicious.

185
00:11:24,201 --> 00:11:25,970
Date your thing.
Well,

186
00:11:25,971 --> 00:11:26,804
half a million Romanians thought so too,
and they took to the streets of 

187
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,930
Bucharest to minutes after the decree 
was.

188
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,610
People will feel that they've been 
cheated,

189
00:11:34,611 --> 00:11:35,580
that David

190
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,740
obviously established corruption kills 
platform.

191
00:11:38,741 --> 00:11:39,574
Its citizens learned about this news 
instantly and boy they did not like it 

192
00:11:43,601 --> 00:11:44,434
at all,
and that is how the biggest protest in 

193
00:11:46,361 --> 00:11:47,700
Romanian streets.

194
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,010
I never dare to think that

195
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
this was possible.
I've always thought there was some 

196
00:11:56,561 --> 00:11:57,394
logic,
some commonsense that would lead to a 

197
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,510
valid law,
but when I saw what happened,

198
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:05,680
I knew I was wrong.
Protest kept going for days,

199
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:08,950
not only in Bucharest about in most 
Romanian cities,

200
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:09,813
the first victim of the unrest was the 
justice minister who was forced to 

201
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:15,490
resign on the ninth of February 2017.
As we mentioned,

202
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:18,370
the protests led to the government to 
retiring this new law.

203
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,490
Although they have already admitted that
this is just temporary.

204
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,353
Further,
the brand new justice minister to 

205
00:12:23,441 --> 00:12:24,274
derailed soda has a clear mission to 
justifying the firing of the general 

206
00:12:27,881 --> 00:12:28,714
prosecutor.
Laura could recheck a basing women who 

207
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:31,643
are jailed over 1000 politicians.
The government claimed that her agency 

208
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:35,914
is running a witch hunt,
but they still haven't found a way to 

209
00:12:38,861 --> 00:12:41,020
legally far her yet

210
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:48,840
valuating constitutionality,
legality and opportunity factors.

211
00:12:48,930 --> 00:12:49,763
I determined that at the moment it's not
advisable to start the institutional 

212
00:12:53,971 --> 00:12:58,650
mechanism to revoke the general 
prosecutor and the DNA chief prosecutor.

213
00:12:58,780 --> 00:12:59,613
At the same time Grimsey all news.
Government is confronted going to 

214
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:03,460
different sites.
On the one hand,

215
00:13:03,461 --> 00:13:05,530
civil society is surveying his 
movements.

216
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,453
On the other hand,
the European Union is demanding that he 

217
00:13:08,201 --> 00:13:09,034
stopped at striking the anticorruption 
prosecutor and of course all of the 

218
00:13:11,831 --> 00:13:12,664
political elite inheritors of 
Ceausescu's regime are turning to 

219
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,090
classic conspiracy theories do protect 
themselves according to them,

220
00:13:19,091 --> 00:13:24,040
George Soros and the Rothschild family 
behind the protesters and they say,

221
00:13:24,041 --> 00:13:24,874
of course,
that corruption is not actually a big 

222
00:13:26,741 --> 00:13:28,210
deal in Romania at all.
Well,

223
00:13:28,211 --> 00:13:29,044
with or without conspiracies,
we are still talking about an 

224
00:13:30,911 --> 00:13:33,820
existential crisis in Europe,
the poorest

225
00:13:33,860 --> 00:13:34,693
country.

226
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,293
Now the question is,
do you think Romania should jail all of 

227
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:44,294
their corrupted politicians,
or do you think that instead the prime 

228
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:49,400
minister is actually doing something 
right by Ge criminalizing bribery?

229
00:13:49,610 --> 00:13:52,790
