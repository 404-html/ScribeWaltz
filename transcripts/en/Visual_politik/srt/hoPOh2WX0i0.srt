1
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:12,710
We wanted flying cars instead of,
we got 140 characters with these words.

2
00:00:12,711 --> 00:00:13,544
Peter Thiel,
the famous Silicon Valley investor who 

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:17,570
we've talked about before,
joins the legions of people.

4
00:00:17,571 --> 00:00:20,990
You consider that innovation in the past
few years has slowed down somewhat,

5
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:21,853
although most of the time of great 
revolutionary inventions seems to have 

6
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:25,550
been left behind.

7
00:00:33,490 --> 00:00:35,350
Who else could have done it?
Start Trek,

8
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,440
Christy.
So competent.

9
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,590
Okay.
Things on that.

10
00:00:40,130 --> 00:00:40,963
Yes.

11
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,433
Example,
if this slowdown can be found in the 

12
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,713
automobile industry,
an industry that has been pretty static 

13
00:00:47,971 --> 00:00:49,080
for decades,
yes,

14
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:51,840
cars nowadays are better than 10 to 20 
years ago,

15
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,420
that's for sure,
but they are basically the same and they

16
00:00:55,421 --> 00:00:57,360
launch any work in the same way.
In fact,

17
00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:58,253
there is nothing substantial that you 
can do with a car today that you 

18
00:01:00,301 --> 00:01:05,220
couldn't do 20 or 30 years ago,
and of course cars still don't fly.

19
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,880
Maybe we present the top 95 you on,
you being,

20
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:08,753
Huh?

21
00:01:20,540 --> 00:01:23,300
Sierra Alpha.
Bravo.

22
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,590
I'm Wendy was talking about a simple 
industry here,

23
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,110
but one of the biggest industries in the
world.

24
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:34,771
However,
I do,

25
00:01:34,771 --> 00:01:37,950
hold on a second here because everything
suggests that finally,

26
00:01:37,951 --> 00:01:41,620
we are on the verge of a great 
revolution in the realm of cars or trans

27
00:01:41,621 --> 00:01:42,454
formation that many experts have 
compared to the one in the early 20th 

28
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:46,134
century that was engineered by Henry 
Ford where he began to use assembly 

29
00:01:48,871 --> 00:01:50,850
lines to mass produce cars.

30
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:58,150
Wow.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:02:01,160
Make this new revolution seems to have 
two key features,

32
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,210
the electric car and the autonomous car.
And here we have an unquestionable star,

33
00:02:06,211 --> 00:02:10,130
a company that isn't managed to start 
changing things and knows how to win the

34
00:02:10,131 --> 00:02:14,780
admiration of the many people who see us
as an example of a new era that is about

35
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:17,300
to begin.
We are of course talking about Tesla.

36
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,143
The company have electric cars that has 
managed to dazzle investors as well as 

37
00:02:21,231 --> 00:02:22,064
governments.
And that in this video we are going to 

38
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:31,470
see you what kind of challenges Tesla is
going to face in the coming years.

39
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,930
So let's dive in.
Okay.

40
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:37,970
Okay.

41
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:40,400
History of wine and roses.

42
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:42,160
That's

43
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:42,993
what is a very young company.
It was born in 2003 with the mission of 

44
00:02:45,971 --> 00:02:46,804
producing an electric car capable of 
competing and defeating combustion 

45
00:02:50,201 --> 00:02:51,400
engines.
Since then,

46
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:54,460
it has managed to basically put on the 
market for models,

47
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,200
the Tesla roadster,
the model s,

48
00:02:56,201 --> 00:02:57,940
the model x hands,
the newcomer,

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
the model three seems to be around the 
few rights.

50
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:06,880
Well,
despite this,

51
00:03:06,881 --> 00:03:09,940
in 2010 the company went public and you 
know what happens?

52
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:10,810
Well,
Tesla,

53
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:13,570
it's become one of the markets stars in 
these years.

54
00:03:13,571 --> 00:03:17,320
The price of their shares has multiplied
by 18 yes.

55
00:03:17,321 --> 00:03:20,170
Just like that.
In 2010 if you had invested $1,000

56
00:03:20,171 --> 00:03:23,560
in Teslas shares today,
you would have $18,000

57
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,394
a pretty amazing investments.
All this growth has led tesla to fight 

58
00:03:27,011 --> 00:03:30,430
for first place among the most valuable 
companies in the United States.

59
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:31,313
Yes.

60
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:37,160
Time of publishing this video,
if you want to buy us well,

61
00:03:37,161 --> 00:03:41,870
prepare your wallet because Tesla is 
worth more than $50 billion.

62
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,600
This is more than the value of forward,
by the way,

63
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,270
Amazon not that far off.
General Motors.

64
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,620
Just have a look at this chart from 
business insight.

65
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:54,630
Yeah.
You think not bad.

66
00:03:57,541 --> 00:03:59,490
Right.
This is especially the case.

67
00:03:59,491 --> 00:04:00,324
If we take into account that it is a 
company that is barely 14 years old and 

68
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:04,170
there's,
well,

69
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,150
honestly doesn't sell that many cars.

70
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:08,523
Generally

71
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:12,120
it sells 10 million cars each year and 
Ford exceeds 6 million,

72
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:16,680
but in 2016 Tesla managed to sell just 
76,000

73
00:04:16,681 --> 00:04:17,514
cars.

74
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:19,893
All right.

75
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,853
Okay.
Many of you are probably thinking right 

76
00:04:21,551 --> 00:04:22,271
now,
well,

77
00:04:22,271 --> 00:04:25,330
come on Tesla.
They already sell luxury cars and yes,

78
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,390
that is true,
but it's still just 76,000

79
00:04:28,391 --> 00:04:33,391
cars,
which is three times less than Paul is.

80
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:37,754
What explains why General Motors sales 
in 2016 we're almost $170 billion while 

81
00:04:42,171 --> 00:04:45,230
tesla remains well below to just 10 
billion.

82
00:04:45,231 --> 00:04:45,300
Yeah.

83
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:46,133
Dollars.

84
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,153
Do you know think that what is happening
is Tesla has very high margins and is 

85
00:04:52,530 --> 00:04:54,330
earning a lot of money.
Not at all.

86
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:55,260
In fact,
in fact,

87
00:04:55,261 --> 00:04:58,740
since the company was founded,
it is not ends money in any single.

88
00:04:58,741 --> 00:04:59,574
Yeah.
Sorry.

89
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,530
This point you're probably wondering,
well,

90
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,900
why then is it worth so much money on 
the stock market?

91
00:05:03,930 --> 00:05:08,490
Why has it been so successful there and 
why indeed is this company so famous?

92
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,153
Wow.

93
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
We all answer to that is that the 
company has a lot to do with a 

94
00:05:14,271 --> 00:05:15,104
revolution that's happening in the 
industry that we commented on before 

95
00:05:17,101 --> 00:05:17,934
hand.
That's the introduction of electric and 

96
00:05:19,181 --> 00:05:20,014
autonomous vehicles.

97
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:29,380
Perfect.
For example,

98
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:33,220
in 2016 there were more than 2 million 
electric cars on the road.

99
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:35,320
60% is more than in the previous.
Yeah.

100
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:36,213
That is to say,
we are talking about markets that are 

101
00:05:37,721 --> 00:05:38,554
growing incredibly quickly.
Further technological advances have cut 

102
00:05:41,561 --> 00:05:42,394
the price of this type of car.
The forecast by Bloomberg new energy 

103
00:05:46,241 --> 00:05:47,074
finance said that electric cars would 
become cheaper than conventional cars 

104
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:55,410
without government subsidies between 
2025 and 2030 and is on the other hand,

105
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:56,244
in as many countries,
including China itself on betting on 

106
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,174
this technology as a way to reduce air 
pollution in cities tend to also as a 

107
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,550
way to reduce their dependence on 
foreign oil.

108
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:10,250
It's not often that environment and 
national security.

109
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,040
It comes together in such a combination,
but here we are.

110
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:18,853
Does that today.
Tesla is the great reference points in 

111
00:06:21,171 --> 00:06:22,004
this new industry.
Many investors understand this and 

112
00:06:23,811 --> 00:06:26,240
therefore value the future of the 
company highly.

113
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,133
The company's own forecasts falling at 
the same line and expects that 

114
00:06:29,211 --> 00:06:33,950
production will increase from 100,000
cars in 2017 to 500,000

115
00:06:33,951 --> 00:06:36,740
in 2020 and more than a million by 2022

116
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:37,623
two

117
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,793
no,
he seems like we're talking about the 

118
00:06:40,551 --> 00:06:42,710
apple of the automotive sector.
Right?

119
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:43,603
Well,
just wait a minute because not 

120
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:48,500
everything that surrounds Tesla is quite
so great.

121
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,023
Eight

122
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:57,850
rusher of money,
Tesla,

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:00,400
they have a problem,
a very serious problem indeed.

124
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:04,210
Kassala in machine for burning money.
Yes,

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,073
you heard me correctly today,
the business is not profitable than the 

126
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:10,600
company loses money every day,
but not only that,

127
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,600
it also has to make a lot of investments
in order to compete.

128
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:14,463
For example,
its factories need pumping with loads 

129
00:07:16,661 --> 00:07:17,494
and loads of money.
We look at the money that comes in and 

130
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:26,320
out of the cash box at Tesla as we 
already did with Amazon.

131
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,810
We can say that from 2010 when it went 
public,

132
00:07:28,811 --> 00:07:31,470
the company has it swallowed absolutely 
everything that is ends.

133
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:35,440
It is the money from the car sales as 
well is about $10 billion more.

134
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,173
Yeah,

135
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:42,230
and the truth is that 2017 is not 
exactly Tesla's best year.

136
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:46,850
In the first nine months of 2017 it's 
swallowed about 4 billion.

137
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:53,250
Yes,
really $4 billion in nine months and not

138
00:07:53,251 --> 00:07:54,084
only that,
but at the same time it's non financial 

139
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:56,730
debt.
For example,

140
00:07:56,731 --> 00:07:59,850
suppliers that have not been paid has 
absolutely skyrocketed.

141
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:03,150
For this reason,
lights are beginning to flash red at the

142
00:08:03,151 --> 00:08:04,680
company.
Consider this graph.

143
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:12,840
Yup.
In the last few months,

144
00:08:12,841 --> 00:08:16,230
Tesla has lost $60 million every single 
day.

145
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:18,720
Money of course,
but it's had to cover with debt,

146
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:19,583
but it doesn't stop that audits all 
testing or is also having many problems 

147
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:24,600
with its latest model constantly 
reveals.

148
00:08:24,601 --> 00:08:29,601
It just made 260 model three cars due to
production bottlenecks.

149
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:32,820
It also has quality problems and has 
dismissed stuff,

150
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,683
which by the way is a little bit weird 
when they seem to need to be making a 

151
00:08:35,851 --> 00:08:39,600
lot more cars rather than less.
So do you want to see the car

152
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:45,580
[inaudible] and

153
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,253
so now you might be thinking,
well surely there's got to be the worst 

154
00:08:51,551 --> 00:08:52,110
of it.
Right?

155
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:52,943
Well just wait a minute because the 
worst of it is that the competition is 

156
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,070
moving really,
really quickly.

157
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,953
Okay.

158
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:07,350
Thousand and 16 the [inaudible] and 
group sold more electric cars than Tesla

159
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:11,160
and pretty much all big companies are 
already working on electric vehicles and

160
00:09:11,161 --> 00:09:13,410
autonomous cars.
I business by the way,

161
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,100
which companies such as apple,
Google and uber are also getting into.

162
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:19,080
And that's some pretty serious 
competition.

163
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:20,790
So yeah,
Tesla is not,

164
00:09:20,791 --> 00:09:22,260
the only player at this

165
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,173
game

166
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:34,380
is that almost all of its rivals is 
actually earned money and their research

167
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,470
budgets at least as big as those at 
Tesla

168
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:38,590
dining

169
00:09:38,590 --> 00:09:39,423
lyric.
Steel's Tesla's thunder with heavy duty 

170
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:42,940
electric truck.

171
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:43,963
So at this point you might be thinking 
about what happens with Nokia and 

172
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:50,120
blackberry when apple stood out from all
the major companies with the iphone.

173
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,330
So now I ask you,
do you think we could compare Tesla with

174
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:58,060
apple?
Well,

175
00:09:58,061 --> 00:09:59,980
I do not believe that the answer is 
easy,

176
00:09:59,981 --> 00:10:03,970
but I do believe there are at least a 
couple of differences that we do have to

177
00:10:03,971 --> 00:10:05,380
take into account.
First.

178
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:06,243
Apple was always worried about earning 
money with the iphone and seconds that 

179
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:11,800
product with something really,
really disruptive.

180
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:14,830
So much so there's even the competition 
predicted its failure.

181
00:10:15,410 --> 00:10:20,060
What Steve Ballmer,
the then CEO of Microsoft said $500

182
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:20,983
I said,
that is the most expensive phone in the 

183
00:10:23,121 --> 00:10:23,954
world and it doesn't appeal to business 
customers because it doesn't have a 

184
00:10:26,391 --> 00:10:27,224
keyboard,
which makes it not a very good email 

185
00:10:29,301 --> 00:10:30,134
machine.
Right now we're selling millions and 

186
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,620
millions and millions of phones a year.
Apple is selling zero phones.

187
00:10:36,621 --> 00:10:40,130
A year is six months.
Let's see how the competition goes.

188
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,150
Steve Vollmer,
former CEO of Microsoft

189
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:47,860
$500 I like our strategy.
I like it a lot.

190
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:48,753
As we have seen tesla does not have 
money or have any particularly 

191
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:52,780
surprising features.
However,

192
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:53,800
it has to be said.
Is this,

193
00:10:53,801 --> 00:10:57,520
making your company on money has not 
been the most motivating element for its

194
00:10:57,521 --> 00:10:59,350
CEO.
The well noon,

195
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,250
Elon Musk

196
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:07,740
mosque,
the vision,

197
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,633
yeah,

198
00:11:09,470 --> 00:11:11,390
sorry.
A genius ahead of his time.

199
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,253
These are many opinions about Elon Musk 
and entrepreneur who has become a 

200
00:11:15,171 --> 00:11:20,171
billionaire from his venture.
Honest,

201
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:21,953
these are businesses that have never 
worried about money with the exception 

202
00:11:24,391 --> 00:11:25,590
of paypal,
Tesla,

203
00:11:25,591 --> 00:11:26,760
I bloop,
space x,

204
00:11:26,790 --> 00:11:27,623
anything which Elon Musk is involved 
with sounds like science fiction and 

205
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:33,120
seems to have an infinite budget.
If something is clear,

206
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:33,954
it is that with his ideas.
Elon musk is influencing us in how we 

207
00:11:36,721 --> 00:11:38,300
see and to build our future.

208
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:40,783
Okay.

209
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,910
This does not mean that the future is 
already written.

210
00:11:47,750 --> 00:11:52,750
Tesla has done very useful work by 
opening the market for electric cars and

211
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:54,040
showing that people

212
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:54,873
may like them.
Another issue is whether it can earn a 

213
00:11:56,951 --> 00:11:59,260
lot of money when it reaches its final 
goal.

214
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:01,720
I won't bet on Tesla.
As an investor,

215
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:04,240
I think it will be very difficult to 
survive.

216
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,380
Andres [inaudible] fund manager,
analyst coboss a m

217
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,770
[inaudible]

218
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,310
the opportunity.
Yeah.

219
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:18,123
Does everything we've seen,
I mean the Tesla is a company doomed to 

220
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,280
failure?
No,

221
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:22,960
of course not.
Saying such a thing.

222
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,300
It's certainly not our intention and 
among other things,

223
00:12:25,301 --> 00:12:30,070
because the future is blank definition 
on set and as big as Tesla also has many

224
00:12:30,071 --> 00:12:31,840
competitive advantages.
For example,

225
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:34,480
today it has an obvious technological 
advantage.

226
00:12:34,510 --> 00:12:37,780
It is a leader in the development and 
the manufacturing of batteries,

227
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,900
which are the key to any electric car 
and very important for growth rate.

228
00:12:41,901 --> 00:12:46,901
Yeah.
Then there is also China,

229
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,980
China,
China,

230
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,600
China,
China,

231
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,973
China.
Do you know who the biggest market for 

232
00:12:56,931 --> 00:12:58,430
electric causes?
Well,

233
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:00,560
you might have guessed it from that last
comment.

234
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:04,400
It is indeed China in this country.
More electric cars are sold each year.

235
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,263
Then on the rest of the planet combines 
and it's government has clearly opted 

236
00:13:08,511 --> 00:13:09,460
for this technology.

237
00:13:12,830 --> 00:13:13,663
Well,

238
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:17,453
Tesla is now negotiating the 
installation of a big factory in 

239
00:13:19,861 --> 00:13:20,694
Shanghai with rather preferential 
conditions and you know was it seems 

240
00:13:23,791 --> 00:13:24,624
that negotiations with the Chinese 
governments are going in the right 

241
00:13:26,731 --> 00:13:28,650
direction anyway,
I knew the future.

242
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:31,500
Well let us know what happens,
but what is clear is that Tesla has been

243
00:13:31,501 --> 00:13:33,480
a turning points for the automotive 
industry,

244
00:13:33,510 --> 00:13:36,090
but that is also a fun facing many 
risks.

245
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,540
The last one for example,
comes from Washington.

246
00:13:38,541 --> 00:13:39,374
Yeah,

247
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:41,580
he

248
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,413
is that the fiscal reform of the 
Republican Party is going to finish 

249
00:13:44,431 --> 00:13:46,650
public aid for the purchase of electric 
cars.

250
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,470
Well,
we will see how that matter runs,

251
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,220
but when Hong Kong did something like 
that,

252
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,440
tesla sales fell markedly.
Anyway,

253
00:13:52,441 --> 00:13:53,274
now it's your turn.
Do you think Tesla will be successful 

254
00:13:55,141 --> 00:13:57,990
and will become the great car company of
the future?

255
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:58,853
Well,
