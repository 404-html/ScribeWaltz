1
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:14,613
Thirty years ago in 1917,
the Russian revolution defeated the 

2
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:20,340
Russian empire after more than three 
centuries of czarist rule,

3
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:22,860
the Romanovs were replaced in a violence
wave,

4
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:23,713
other Soviet regime,
the seed that would turn into the 

5
00:00:25,511 --> 00:00:26,344
Soviet,

6
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:35,680
but the results of this wasn't exactly 
more freedom for the Russian people.

7
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:37,780
How are the.
This is not a history video.

8
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:38,614
We're not going to discuss the past,
but rather the present and that's 

9
00:00:41,531 --> 00:00:42,364
because many are seeing the new 
situation in Russia as the rebirth of a 

10
00:00:45,881 --> 00:00:46,714
new cyrus regime.
But is it fair to really talk about a 

11
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:50,453
new czarist?
Russia isn't perhaps some kind of 

12
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,770
overreaction.
Well,

13
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,000
let's see.
By the way,

14
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,290
in this video you're also going to learn
what is the fastest way to become rich,

15
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,970
filthy rich and facts,
but don't worry,

16
00:01:00,971 --> 00:01:01,804
we haven't gotten insane and we're not 
going to try and tell you about a great 

17
00:01:03,371 --> 00:01:06,160
opportunity you're missing out on with 
pyramid scheme xY,

18
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:06,940
,
Z.

19
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:08,140
I'll explain more in a bit.

20
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,930
Around 18 years ago,
on the 30,

21
00:01:24,931 --> 00:01:27,750
first of December,
1999 are still unknown.

22
00:01:27,751 --> 00:01:31,710
Vladimir Putin became the president of 
Russia and in 2018,

23
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,544
Putin will likely win the elections and 
remained presidents for another six 

24
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,144
years,
so when this next legislative term is 

25
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:38,970
finished in 20,
24,

26
00:01:38,971 --> 00:01:43,380
cute in that will have already ruled 
Russia for 25 years and this is a longer

27
00:01:43,381 --> 00:01:46,830
period of role than many of the songs 
from Russia's pre-revolution history.

28
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:47,723
Indeed,
Putin has developed a political system 

29
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:51,990
with a close resemblance to that of the 
older Russian empire.

30
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:53,940
Boozing has developed a similar 
political system,

31
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:57,700
but with a personal touch and just a 
dusting of Soviet seasoning.

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:58,853
On the one hand,
Putin's new regime has restored two of 

33
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:04,800
the main features of the older ussr,
propaganda and repression.

34
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:10,670
Opposition leader Alexei Navalny,
jailed as 1,750 arrested during protests

35
00:02:10,771 --> 00:02:12,090
across Russia.
That's right.

36
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:14,490
With Putin and charge,
we could say that the secret service and

37
00:02:14,491 --> 00:02:17,100
the political police,
which once was the old kgb,

38
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:21,300
I've come back to life and they are now 
known as the Federal Security Service.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,520
Also,
one of the first things boot in did when

40
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:24,354
he reached was to take control over 
television and the media and set up a 

41
00:02:27,451 --> 00:02:31,590
powerful campaign of patriotic 
glorification with a clear goal.

42
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:34,230
That goal being to get people to 
subscribe to the notion that,

43
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,123
Hey,
bruce and Sarah and Russia's amazing 

44
00:02:36,361 --> 00:02:37,081
again,
all right,

45
00:02:37,081 --> 00:02:39,330
but if we consider the use of propaganda
rindge,

46
00:02:39,331 --> 00:02:41,670
repression of Soviet heritage,
mostly,

47
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:45,990
why are we talking about a new saw?
Well,

48
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:46,824
that's partly because he has restored 
the close alliance between the Orthodox 

49
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:50,933
Church and the state,
but mainly because Putin has 

50
00:02:51,901 --> 00:02:52,734
consolidated a state controlled by a 
powerful oligarchy that is similar to 

51
00:02:56,131 --> 00:02:59,590
the old feudal system or the aristocracy
of the Russian empire.

52
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,483
You See,
Putin has befriended a group of people 

53
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,830
to whom he has granted control of the 
big companies in the country and whom he

54
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:06,940
has made very rich.

55
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:07,813
I remember when I told you we were going
to tell you the fastest way to become a 

56
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,260
multimillionaire.
Well,

57
00:03:11,261 --> 00:03:14,380
this is the formula,
the friend Vladimir Putin,

58
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,810
so believe me,
I'll consider this.

59
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,080
We can talk about Sergei roles again.
Putin's childhood friends.

60
00:03:20,081 --> 00:03:20,914
He received around $2,000,000,000 in 
government funds or other close friends 

61
00:03:23,621 --> 00:03:24,454
like ego section,
Putin's old chief of staff or Alexi 

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,080
Miller and all his collaborator and 
consultants,

63
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:32,500
or there's Sergei tremor,
resolve and old friends from the KGB.

64
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:33,363
They are all multimillionaires today and
they are the ceos of some of the most 

65
00:03:36,011 --> 00:03:40,720
important state owned companies.
Gazprom and and Ross tack no bad.

66
00:03:40,721 --> 00:03:42,520
Right,
and do you think for a moment,

67
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,970
these are isolated situations.
There are tons of examples.

68
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:47,200
Tymchenko,
Rosenberg,

69
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,443
truck Shama love.
It can be definitely said that if you 

70
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,960
are friends you aren't doing or right 
indeed.

71
00:03:52,961 --> 00:03:53,794
Many of these people appear in the 
Forbes list of the wealthiest people in 

72
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,330
the world and it is not just them.
I mean these people,

73
00:03:58,331 --> 00:03:59,164
they're now getting old and they are 
passing on that wealth to their 

74
00:04:00,971 --> 00:04:01,804
children.
It is normal to see many of these big 

75
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:04,053
national companies that have grown 
enormously since Putin reached power 

76
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:10,450
being run by the 25 to 35 year old 
children of Putin's friends.

77
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,310
Degas Lucas,
Nikolai Shama law,

78
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,340
a multimillionaire,
friends of Poussin,

79
00:04:20,350 --> 00:04:22,220
aunties to children.
One of them year.

80
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,073
He became the CEO of gas phones,
one of the most important retirement 

81
00:04:25,491 --> 00:04:27,400
funds in Russia.
The other Kirill,

82
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,273
he was the vice president of sperm.
They large state controls petrochemical 

83
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:34,220
company when he was just 25 years old.
By the way,

84
00:04:34,221 --> 00:04:36,410
Carol Marriott's Putin's daughter soon 
after,

85
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,970
and you know what?
He's an LV,

86
00:04:37,971 --> 00:04:42,290
wealthiest young person in Russia with a
fortune exceeding $1,000,000,000.

87
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,153
Indeed the prime minister Dmitry 
Medvedev hasn't been accused of getting 

88
00:04:45,531 --> 00:04:49,160
rich from the state and having palaces 
and vineyards all over Russia.

89
00:04:49,190 --> 00:04:50,023
I'm actually going to link to a 
documentary that exposed all of this in 

90
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:55,280
the description below.
It is absolutely worth or watch,

91
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:59,330
and so now you might be wondering why is
Putin doing all of this is just a really

92
00:04:59,331 --> 00:05:00,710
generous dues.
Well,

93
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:02,900
whether he is or not,
that is not.

94
00:05:02,900 --> 00:05:03,733
His real goal here is not just making 
his friends rich because they are his 

95
00:05:07,131 --> 00:05:07,964
friends.
Well Putin is trying to do with this 

96
00:05:10,701 --> 00:05:14,750
strategy is grant himself control over 
the resources of the state as well.

97
00:05:14,751 --> 00:05:16,310
Who's paying for this?
Well,

98
00:05:16,311 --> 00:05:19,400
that would be these citizens of Russia.
All right,

99
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,960
so we have oligarchy,
repression,

100
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,700
religion,
propaganda for state control,

101
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:23,534
control over all economic and political 
issues in Russian society and these 

102
00:05:26,931 --> 00:05:27,764
makeup,
the main ingredients of the political 

103
00:05:29,271 --> 00:05:30,104
regime created by this and use,
and it goes beyond Zanny ideological 

104
00:05:33,501 --> 00:05:35,120
reproach.
Look at what [inaudible] Jones,

105
00:05:35,121 --> 00:05:37,310
a famous leftwing British person had to 
say,

106
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:40,960
right wing authoritarian leader who 
attacks civil liberties,

107
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:42,380
stigmatizes,
lesbian,

108
00:05:42,381 --> 00:05:43,220
gay,
bisexual,

109
00:05:43,221 --> 00:05:45,600
and transgender people indulgence and 
chauvinism,

110
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:48,380
nationalism.
He's in bed with rapacious oligarchs and

111
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,700
who is admired by the European and 
American heart,

112
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,553
right?
Russia is ruled by a human rights 

113
00:05:52,971 --> 00:05:55,520
abusing expansionist,
oligarchic regimes,

114
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:58,340
the Russian people and their deserve 
better.

115
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,650
Owen Jones.
And while now you might be wondering.

116
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,090
Yeah,
but what about outside of Russia?

117
00:06:02,091 --> 00:06:02,924
I mean,
how much power does Vladimir Putin and 

118
00:06:04,350 --> 00:06:06,170
command on the world stage?
Well,

119
00:06:06,171 --> 00:06:08,450
as we already said in a previous video 
about China,

120
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:13,070
we can understand power as influence and
we can observe three brunches,

121
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,540
military,
economic and political.

122
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:16,374
Yeah.

123
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,150
Rebirth of a Titan,

124
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:25,053
Vladimir Putin,
Russia into one of the countries with 

125
00:06:26,831 --> 00:06:28,930
the highest relative spend on the 
military,

126
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:32,380
way above China and the USA.
Just take a look at this chart while the

127
00:06:32,381 --> 00:06:33,214
US is spending approximately nine 
percent of the government's budget and 

128
00:06:35,591 --> 00:06:36,424
China is spending around six percent.
Russia is spending more than 15 percent 

129
00:06:39,251 --> 00:06:43,750
of the budget supporting the army right 
after the fall of the Soviet Union in 19

130
00:06:43,810 --> 00:06:44,643
nineties,
the image of Russian forces was a rusty 

131
00:06:46,631 --> 00:06:47,464
boats,
planes that could fly and corrupt 

132
00:06:48,851 --> 00:06:49,684
officials that you'd like to empty their
arsenals to sell the weapons on the 

133
00:06:51,761 --> 00:06:53,500
black market who's in?
Well,

134
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:56,110
he wants it to change that and today 
things they are very,

135
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:01,140
very different.
Since Putin reached power and especially

136
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,614
since 2008,
Putin has made it a priority to update 

137
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:07,940
to the army.
So in the last few years they have spent

138
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,833
tens of billions of dollars turning the 
old Russian army into a modern military 

139
00:07:12,411 --> 00:07:13,244
force.
But even more important than that is 

140
00:07:14,451 --> 00:07:17,970
that they have made serious upgrades to 
that fire firepower plains missiles,

141
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,030
ships.
They are all being updated.

142
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,293
Look closely in 2015 alone,
according to the figures of the Russian 

143
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,613
Ministry of Defense,
the army got four ships for submarines 

144
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:34,590
50 to support ships,
27 aircrafts and 45 artillery units,

145
00:07:34,630 --> 00:07:38,340
but not everyone shares this opinion.
In fact,

146
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:39,203
one former US general told me that a 
single US super aircraft carrier group 

147
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:42,923
could obliterate the entire Russian navy
as the equipment is so dated and 

148
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:46,224
technologically obsolete.
Azeem O'brian research professor at the 

149
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:51,300
United States Army War College.
Regardless,

150
00:07:51,301 --> 00:07:52,134
we could save the Russian army has 
become a key part of Moscow's 

151
00:07:54,181 --> 00:07:55,014
international politics,
and it is not just this political 

152
00:07:56,701 --> 00:07:59,460
influence in other countries and 
international conflicts,

153
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:03,360
but also the renewed capacity of the 
Russian arms industry.

154
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:05,520
Further,
do not forget about all those nukes they

155
00:08:05,521 --> 00:08:10,521
have.
They have a lot of nukes,

156
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:13,720
feet

157
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:16,380
of clay.
Now,

158
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,020
if we can see the Russian army as an 
asset for Pearson,

159
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:22,110
the wrecked Russian economy is certainly
his main weakness.

160
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:22,973
Russia is basically a producer and an 
exporter of natural resources and 

161
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:28,950
Russia's economy isn't nowhere even 
close to China's.

162
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:29,843
In the last few decades,
Russia has been unable to diversify or 

163
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:34,680
develop a complex and productive 
economy,

164
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,200
not even close.
Russia is more and more dependent on its

165
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,140
natural resources every day.
Indeed,

166
00:08:40,141 --> 00:08:42,720
they are so dependent on them that 
everything is great.

167
00:08:42,721 --> 00:08:43,554
When the prices are high,
that's when they are not a crisis kicks 

168
00:08:45,991 --> 00:08:46,824
off.
These are Barack Obama's words from his 

169
00:08:48,241 --> 00:08:50,280
final press conference.
As presidents,

170
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,760
the Russians can't change us or 
significantly weaken us.

171
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,980
They're a smaller country.
They weaker country.

172
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,970
Their economy doesn't produce anything 
that anybody wants to buy except oil and

173
00:08:59,971 --> 00:09:01,680
gas and arms.
They don't innovate.

174
00:09:01,681 --> 00:09:02,514
Barack Obama as the oligarchy states and
those Putin is creators has a lot to do 

175
00:09:05,941 --> 00:09:06,300
with it.

176
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:09,840
The state has simply taken a more and 
more important role in the economy since

177
00:09:09,841 --> 00:09:10,674
2005.
It was then 35 percent and today it is 

178
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:14,003
70 percent and let us not forget that 
this process has been led by Putin's 

179
00:09:17,251 --> 00:09:19,350
buddies and sure in this situation,
I mean,

180
00:09:19,351 --> 00:09:20,184
of course corruption spreads and 
competition disappears and with those 

181
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:23,604
things gone.
There's not really much of an incentive 

182
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:25,944
for them to do things right,
and that's why the future of Russia's 

183
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:28,674
economy,
it's looking pretty bleak once some 

184
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:32,010
proof of this,
but in 2016,

185
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:35,610
more than 400,000 people left the 
country and many of these people,

186
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:38,060
whether young and educated anyway,
the Russian model,

187
00:09:38,061 --> 00:09:38,894
it just doesn't seem capable of 
encouraging growth and development in 

188
00:09:41,191 --> 00:09:44,370
the country and besides think about it,
this is a weakness itself.

189
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:48,060
A poor economy means less influence and 
less potential to develop the military.

190
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,610
And finally the third branch,
and that's political power.

191
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:51,473
We could discuss further the moves with 
China or the Russian strategy in the 

192
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:55,463
Middle East where Moscow is trying to 
take influence from their less than the 

193
00:09:57,900 --> 00:09:58,733
United States,
but I think we should leave that for a 

194
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:01,980
future video.
So now we wonder,

195
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:04,620
what's your opinion?
What do you think about Vladimir Putin?

196
00:10:04,621 --> 00:10:05,790
Do you agree with us?
Disagree?

197
00:10:05,791 --> 00:10:07,620
Well,

They provided the vocals in this episode
that we're not mine,

202
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,190
and as always,
thank you for.

203
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,120
Okay.
