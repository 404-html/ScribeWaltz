1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,093
Thursday,
December 28 2017 the year was bound to 

3
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:15,140
ams and the world gets ready to welcome 
2018 like every year.

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:20,170
Newsrooms are practically on pause and 
Tony talk about three basic topics reuse

5
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:21,164
on 2017 predictions of what 2018 may 
bring and to news about how the arrival 

6
00:00:25,731 --> 00:00:29,090
of the New Year we'll be celebrated in 
nitty every corner of it.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:29,963
The wells,

8
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,340
however you have,
you are thirsty to some of the 28th when

9
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:42,220
the year seemed to be over.
This news came out,

10
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,330
numerous protests and demonstrations 
began to emerge throughout Iran.

11
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:48,240
It all began in the city of Masada.
Historic,

12
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:51,160
she knows pilgrimage site,
the hometown of the supreme leader,

13
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:51,994
Ayatollah common aim,
and it's one of the bastions of the 

14
00:00:54,131 --> 00:00:54,964
regime.

15
00:00:57,310 --> 00:01:00,880
Well,
surprisingly it was here in this Islamic

16
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:03,760
Revolution Sanctuary for the first 
antigovernment protests emerged.

17
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:06,760
Some demonstrations spread quickly 
throughout the country,

18
00:01:06,790 --> 00:01:10,720
resulting in more than 20 deaths and 
over a thousand detainees.

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,670
But that's that time when everything was
beginning.

20
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:13,533
Many people wondered if we were 
witnessing the birth of a new kind of 

21
00:01:16,181 --> 00:01:18,580
Persian spring.
The president of the United States.

22
00:01:18,581 --> 00:01:19,414
Donald Trump seem to suggest that Iran 
is failing at every level despite the 

23
00:01:23,171 --> 00:01:25,570
terrible deal made with them by the 
Obama administration.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,660
The great Iranian people had been 
repressed for many years.

25
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:31,660
They are hungry for food and for freedom
along with human rights.

26
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,680
The wealth of a ram is being looted.
Time for Change Butts.

27
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,520
Just the moments if we really witnessed 
an incipient Persians spring,

28
00:01:39,550 --> 00:01:43,120
have we rarely seen the powerful 
ayatollah's regime wobble?

29
00:01:43,150 --> 00:01:44,080
Well,
no,

30
00:01:44,081 --> 00:01:44,914
we haven't.
Not imminently at least you'll see what 

31
00:01:47,141 --> 00:01:48,220
I mean.
And just a moment.

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,393
However,
not being at the beginning of a Persian 

33
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:56,794
spring doesn't mean that Iran isn't 
undergoing events that are very 

34
00:01:59,591 --> 00:02:02,650
important to the country's future.
Hands by extension,

35
00:02:02,651 --> 00:02:04,180
important to the future of the Middle 
East.

36
00:02:04,210 --> 00:02:07,420
So the viewer here we have three key 
questions.

37
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,540
First,
why do these protests occur?

38
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:13,780
What would their cause seconds who lit 
this entire movement spark?

39
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,240
And third,
what can we expect?

40
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,390
Will these events have any effects on 
Iran?

41
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:20,253
Well,
let's answer these three questions and 

42
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:26,050
see why all of these movements show us 
how the Islamic Revolution in Iran,

43
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:26,913
the totalitarian regime that now 
controls the country is facing rapid 

44
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:35,160
erosion fires,
causes,

45
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:43,530
as we've seen in previous videos here on
visual politic,

46
00:02:43,531 --> 00:02:47,550
Iran is one of the countries with the 
most natural resources in the world.

47
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,413
It has the fourth largest oil reserves,
the second largest natural gas reserves 

48
00:02:51,571 --> 00:02:52,710
as their copper,
iron,

49
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,491
zinc,
uranium,

50
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:54,324
and silver deposits among many other 
resources are also among the largest in 

51
00:02:58,111 --> 00:02:59,410
the world,
and that's not all.

52
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,244
If that one's enough,
it also has a relatively young as well 

53
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:03,820
educated population.
For example,

54
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:07,810
every year almost 5 million young people
attend university.

55
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,270
In principle,
it seems like this country,

56
00:03:11,271 --> 00:03:14,440
you should have an easy time getting 
things to go well for us,

57
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:15,820
however,
despite this,

58
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:18,220
it's economy is a disaster.

59
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:20,913
Okay?

60
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:25,803
Employment shortage in Iran,
especially for the youngest who suffer 

61
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,290
unemployment rates of 40% inflation is 
also in the double digits.

62
00:03:32,291 --> 00:03:36,250
The currency has suffered notable 
depreciation and the government has been

63
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:38,740
forced to cut several social benefit.

64
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:43,373
This all clashes head on with the huge 
expectations generated from the 2015 

65
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:49,320
nuclear agreements.
See,

66
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,183
there was widespread hope that this 
government would be a turning point for 

67
00:03:53,371 --> 00:03:54,204
the country's economy.
Investments would begin to arrive in 

68
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:59,280
world markets would reopen to do 
business with Iran.

69
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:00,143
President Rohani himself supported this 
thesis and the truth is since the 

70
00:04:03,481 --> 00:04:05,910
agreement was signed,
things they have improved.

71
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,890
Since many of the sanctions were lifted 
in 2016 not all of them,

72
00:04:10,891 --> 00:04:11,724
though the United States actually still 
maintained several oil production has 

73
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:15,024
increased by 20% public accounts have 
improved and the growth rate has sought 

74
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:19,980
to almost 7%

75
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,163
these changes haven't been enough among 
other things because the Iranian 

76
00:04:26,241 --> 00:04:29,150
economy,
it has more holes than Swiss cheese.

77
00:04:29,210 --> 00:04:32,420
See,
corruption is very widespread.

78
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,220
A good section of the economy is in the 
hands of corporations that are linked to

79
00:04:37,221 --> 00:04:39,260
politicians,
religious foundations,

80
00:04:39,261 --> 00:04:40,094
and the powerful revolution regard,
and they of course receive all kinds of 

81
00:04:43,971 --> 00:04:44,804
privileges.
It isn't fair that a lot of Iranian 

82
00:04:47,311 --> 00:04:48,144
suffer,
while a large part of the budget is 

83
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:53,000
allocated to Islamic organizations whose
functions we don't know that well,

84
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:53,863
poverty takes over everything.
Even people's religion Mussa of retired 

85
00:04:56,661 --> 00:04:59,510
person and participate in the protest 
rallies in Tehran.

86
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:00,463
In fact,
it is estimated that it's a bit more 

87
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:02,474
than 20% of the economy belongs to what 
we might consider the purely private 

88
00:05:06,381 --> 00:05:07,280
sector.
Yup.

89
00:05:07,370 --> 00:05:11,390
Really only 20% c doing business in Iran
is really,

90
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,253
really complicated.
Seeing the world's banks doing business 

91
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:16,934
ranking,
which measures how easy it is to do 

92
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:22,841
business in a country ranked Iran in 
position 124 as if we take a look at the

93
00:05:23,271 --> 00:05:26,510
economic freedom index.
The results are even worse.

94
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:30,430
They occupy the 155th place and well 
Iran,

95
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,333
it isn't even a World Trade Organization
member and it maintains average tariffs 

96
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,770
of approximately 25%

97
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,490
I did that.
When's enough?

98
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:45,770
The government spends huge results is 
abroad,

99
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:47,120
can Syria,
Lebanon,

100
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,073
Iraq and Yemen for example,
which in addition to spending a loss of 

101
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,620
Iran scas money fuels the investment 
community's panic.

102
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,483
Just think about it for a moment.
Who is willing to their savings in a 

103
00:05:58,131 --> 00:05:59,450
country like Iran?
I mean,

104
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,760
don't tell me that's not just a little 
bit scary.

105
00:06:02,290 --> 00:06:03,123
The main problem comes from the 
revolutions export ideology and from 

106
00:06:05,631 --> 00:06:07,850
supporting the Shiite groups from 
Lebanon to Yemen.

107
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:08,803
The system spends money on these 
campaigns without taking the needs of 

108
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:15,050
the people into account far Mars,
last student and activist.

109
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,033
Of course,
the results of this disastrous motto 

110
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,650
falls on the shoulders of Iran citizens,
especially its youngest,

111
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:22,513
and this is important to it because it 
is estimated that around 50% of the 

112
00:06:25,281 --> 00:06:28,430
country's population is less than 30 
years old.

113
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:34,220
Now we know what sparked this protest,
but is behind all of this.

114
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,143
Who organized the first rallies?
Could it actually have been the United 

115
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:38,953
States as the Toronto regime denounced?
Could it have been a well organized and 

116
00:06:41,541 --> 00:06:43,070
well prepared?
It's political opposition.

117
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,150
Well,
let's see that.

118
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,700
Listen,
I've hit because you might be surprised.

119
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:53,090
The instigator.

120
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,053
At first they were as usual,
several interpretations about what was 

121
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,354
happening and one of them was the theory
that a popular revolution could be 

122
00:07:03,181 --> 00:07:05,800
starting a very particular Persian 
spring.

123
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:08,163
However,
do you view,

124
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:11,320
it was soon clear that some pieces did 
not seem to fit at all.

125
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:13,660
See,
on the one hand is protest,

126
00:07:13,661 --> 00:07:14,494
it's exploded in some of the most 
controlled and most talkative cities in 

127
00:07:17,591 --> 00:07:19,040
the country.
On the other hands on,

128
00:07:19,041 --> 00:07:22,240
like for example,
the so called 2009 green revolution this

129
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:25,150
time the main role did not fall on the 
middle classes,

130
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:27,250
which tend to be more secular and 
reformist,

131
00:07:27,251 --> 00:07:30,850
but curiously on the poorer conservative
causes.

132
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,580
And so on top of that,
the first protest of messages were aimed

133
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:37,570
mainly at the president's isn't clear 
who has organized these demonstrations,

134
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:40,020
but most slogans were against raw honey.
How mom had,

135
00:07:40,021 --> 00:07:40,854
he is as ours,
editor in chief c even though elections 

136
00:07:43,691 --> 00:07:45,400
are held in Iran to choose the 
president,

137
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,610
candidates are ultimately chosen by the 
supreme leader.

138
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:52,000
The ayatollah who at the moment of truth
has the last word.

139
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:54,093
This is why he's the supreme leader.
While the fact is the president of 

140
00:07:56,811 --> 00:07:57,644
Rouhani,
honey is let's say a reformist and a 

141
00:07:59,831 --> 00:08:00,664
soft hearted political leader of course,
as much of a reformist and softhearted 

142
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,060
vertical leader as we could expect in a 
regime like Iran.

143
00:08:07,330 --> 00:08:09,850
And while he may not have reached every 
expectation,

144
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:13,960
he did take some steps towards a certain
amount of openness in the country.

145
00:08:14,470 --> 00:08:15,303
Under Mr raw honey,
strict Islamic rules have been somewhat 

146
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:18,820
relaxed,
concerts have been allowed,

147
00:08:18,821 --> 00:08:21,160
and the morals police are largely off 
the streets.

148
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:23,290
Illegal parties that usually no longer 
rated,

149
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:24,303
although there have been exceptions.
So if what you're demanding are more 

150
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:27,964
reforms and more freedom,
attacking the most reformist president 

151
00:08:31,031 --> 00:08:33,730
would seem,
at the very least rather curious,

152
00:08:33,731 --> 00:08:34,564
don't you think?
Well,

153
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:37,420
as you might imagine,
this does have an explanation.

154
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:40,360
The powerful revolution regards main 
chief himself,

155
00:08:40,361 --> 00:08:43,810
Muhammed Ali Jafari made it very clear 
at first,

156
00:08:43,811 --> 00:08:44,644
the instigators leader was none other 
than the former president Ahmadinejad 

157
00:08:47,711 --> 00:08:52,711
himself.
That's right.

158
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,153
Ultra conservative groups organized the 
first protests to erode the reformists 

159
00:08:58,591 --> 00:09:02,400
political capitol bird of course,
in a country where 50% of the population

160
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,430
is less than 30 whether it's widespread 
frustration.

161
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:07,740
And above all smartphones and Internet 
access.

162
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:12,300
It's not a surprise that the contagion 
spread very quickly within hours.

163
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:13,134
The calls to protest spread through 
social networks and communication 

164
00:09:15,091 --> 00:09:15,924
applications such as telegram,
the most popular application and the 

165
00:09:18,121 --> 00:09:18,954
country.
Suddenly spontaneous protests broke out 

166
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:21,440
all over the car.

167
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,273
I'm sure

168
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:26,753
of course,
complaints about the economic situation 

169
00:09:28,021 --> 00:09:29,880
we're seeing joins by demands for 
freedom.

170
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:31,950
Yes,
we could really save the all of this got

171
00:09:31,951 --> 00:09:33,840
rather out of hands for the ultra 
conservative.

172
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:40,280
Of course the government didn't take 
long to reactions.

173
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,123
Use the force.
We can all imagine a dictatorship like 

174
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,240
this has detentions,
considerable threats,

175
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:47,250
and even capital punishment due to 
rebellion,

176
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:48,084
freeze in connection with foreign 
intelligence services or began as for 

177
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:53,670
the recent days,
developments in the country and it means

178
00:09:53,671 --> 00:09:54,504
have been united to create problems for 
the Islamic system by using various 

179
00:09:57,211 --> 00:09:59,160
means including money,
weapons,

180
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:02,160
politics and security apparatus 
Ayatollah Khomeini,

181
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:03,123
their response was so big that the 
government has just announced a 

182
00:10:05,311 --> 00:10:06,144
prohibition on teaching English in 
primary schools supposedly to avoid 

183
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,310
cultural invasion.
As you can imagine,

184
00:10:11,340 --> 00:10:13,230
all of this stops the protests.
However,

185
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,480
even though we aren't facing a Persian 
and spraying,

186
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:16,373
the fact is that all these events showed
several of the totalitarian regimes 

187
00:10:19,621 --> 00:10:24,621
weaknesses,
yes,

188
00:10:27,050 --> 00:10:27,883
have a failed revolution since the 
Islamic Revolution took place back in 

189
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:34,474
1979 the wrong government has made a lot
of efforts to achieve a strong national 

190
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:41,700
identity built on religion.
See,

191
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:42,783
according to the Iranian news agency,
there are more than one and a half 

192
00:10:45,041 --> 00:10:45,874
million.
Yes,

193
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,713
one and a half million clerics teaching 
the Koran and promoting Islamic 

194
00:10:50,351 --> 00:10:54,220
principles in schools and in all kinds 
of educational institutions.

195
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,030
However,
despite all these efforts,

196
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,820
Iranian society,
which as we saw is very,

197
00:11:02,821 --> 00:11:03,654
very young,
is becoming increasingly secular and 

198
00:11:05,401 --> 00:11:07,880
increasingly dissatisfied with a country
model.

199
00:11:07,881 --> 00:11:10,050
If that lies far from their way of 
thinking.

200
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:10,973
As you can imagine,
the Internet has played a key role in 

201
00:11:12,691 --> 00:11:12,940
all of it.

202
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,773
Yes.

203
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,473
Well,
if we add the regimes inability to 

204
00:11:17,711 --> 00:11:20,590
generate opportunities for all these 
young people to all of this,

205
00:11:20,620 --> 00:11:24,850
it isn't unreasonable to think that we 
will witness a very fast erosion of this

206
00:11:24,851 --> 00:11:27,640
country's political pillars in the next 
few years.

207
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,091
Mind,
do you?

208
00:11:28,091 --> 00:11:30,340
This is harder to imagine in Saudi 
Arabia,

209
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:31,174
and even then,
we are beginning to see it with the 

210
00:11:32,621 --> 00:11:35,650
changes that Crown Prince Mohammed bin 
Salman is introducing.

211
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,510
Well,
they Raelian society is much more open,

212
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,403
much more secular,
independent of religion and better 

213
00:11:40,211 --> 00:11:41,110
formed.
So,

214
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,730
well,
we'll just have to wait and see.

215
00:11:43,870 --> 00:11:46,570
But now it's your turn.
Do you think that the ayatollah's regime

216
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,433
will be able to contain such a changing 
force where we begin to see changes in 

217
00:11:50,951 --> 00:11:51,641
Iran?
Well,
