1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
For decades,
manufacturing companies dominated every 

2
00:00:03,110 --> 00:00:03,943
largest company ranking on the planet 
because they weren't synonymous with 

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,660
success and economic power.
Here is,

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:11,940
for example,
and I'm sure it's no surprise,

5
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,580
China's huge economic takeoff in recent 
years.

6
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:18,103
I take over.
It has a lot to do with the 

7
00:00:19,021 --> 00:00:21,870
manufacturing industry.
Thanks to it.

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,460
So far.
In the 21st century,

9
00:00:23,461 --> 00:00:28,040
the Asian giants is multiplied its 
exports by 10 rising from just $257,

10
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,510
billions more than two point 
$4,000,000,000,000.

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:38,810
That's why when we think about China,
about the Chinese economy,

12
00:00:38,811 --> 00:00:39,644
it's very easy,
the images of a smoke filled country 

13
00:00:41,721 --> 00:00:42,554
full of huge dirty factories with 
thousands and thousands of workers 

14
00:00:45,471 --> 00:00:46,304
making all kinds of junk for miserable 
salaries to come to mind and you know 

15
00:00:50,750 --> 00:00:51,710
what?
To be honest,

16
00:00:51,711 --> 00:00:54,260
when you first step into China for the 
first time,

17
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:56,180
you realize that you probably weren't 
wrong.

18
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,210
However,
just because this is the China,

19
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:03,230
we all know,
but it's no longer the only China.

20
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,090
Before we continue,
I got a question for you.

21
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:08,570
What would you say is the biggest video 
game company in the world?

22
00:01:08,660 --> 00:01:13,660
I'll listen up.
We've talked about it in several videos.

23
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:23,580
China is changing out full speed every 
year.

24
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:24,443
Millions and millions of people leave 
poverty behind to become part of the 

25
00:01:27,061 --> 00:01:28,260
middle class.
However,

26
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,153
today we're going to focus on a slightly
different aspects on one of the sectors 

27
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:33,173
that's changing the most.
Something that may be quite surprising 

28
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:37,194
to many of you.
I'm talking about China's digital 

29
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,280
revolution.
Yep.

30
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:45,360
You heard that right?
China,

31
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:51,560
the country of cheap stuff is quickly 
becoming a technological giants,

32
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,230
and the truth is that in terms of the 
digital terrain,

33
00:01:54,231 --> 00:01:56,780
in many ways it's even ahead of the 
western powers.

34
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,010
Don't believe me.
Well,

35
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,840
let's take a look for example of what's 
happening with economy.

36
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,633
Just a decade ago,
China's share and the global ecommerce 

37
00:02:05,921 --> 00:02:07,930
market was less than one percent.
Today,

38
00:02:07,931 --> 00:02:08,764
almost half 42 percent of all ECOMMERCE 
transactions on the planet come from 

39
00:02:13,421 --> 00:02:15,940
China.
To give you an idea of what this means,

40
00:02:15,941 --> 00:02:16,774
it's estimated that China's ecommerce 
market is already greater than those of 

41
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:21,010
France,
Germany,

42
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,720
the United Kingdom,
Japan,

43
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,840
and the U.
s combined surprised.

44
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:28,910
Well,
you shouldn't be.

45
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,730
China's digital economy is growing at 
four speeds,

46
00:02:31,790 --> 00:02:32,623
and I'm not exaggerating here.
According to the China Academy of 

47
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:37,130
Information and communications 
technology,

48
00:02:37,131 --> 00:02:37,964
you have already agreed to it in the 
Ministry of Industry and Information 

49
00:02:39,891 --> 00:02:41,450
Technology,
the digital economy,

50
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:42,284
you could already account for 30 percent
of the entire Chinese economy because 

51
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,053
it's not just about ecommerce.
The number of Internet users in China 

52
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,280
exceeds 700 million people more than the
Internet users in the European Union and

53
00:02:56,151 --> 00:03:01,151
the United States.
Yeah,

54
00:03:04,981 --> 00:03:05,814
yeah.
I know they have many more inhabitants 

55
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,464
and in fact the internet expansion rate 
is still lower in China than in Europe 

56
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,754
or the United States,
but just think about that market sites 

57
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,063
that is used magnets years.
All the 700 million people is a lot of 

58
00:03:19,031 --> 00:03:20,410
people and yeah,
it's true.

59
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:21,303
You may have all heard about the great 
firewall with which the Chinese 

60
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,520
government sends us a lot of services 
and websites such as Google,

61
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:28,630
facebook,
or youtube

62
00:03:28,690 --> 00:03:29,523
issue.

63
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:33,560
Yes.
Unfortunately,

64
00:03:33,561 --> 00:03:34,394
that firewall does exist and yes,
unfortunately the Chinese government 

65
00:03:36,921 --> 00:03:37,754
exerts see huge amounts of censorship on
the information that Chinese citizens 

66
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:43,130
can access,
but despite this,

67
00:03:43,131 --> 00:03:43,964
the Internet is the Internet,
so it's not all that surprising to 

68
00:03:46,761 --> 00:03:47,594
realize that the use of vpn networks to 
bypass government control rates is not 

69
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:54,580
exactly low in China and besides 
everything that isn't,

70
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:56,960
politics does kind of work with enough 
freedom.

71
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,794
In fact,
the Beijing government itself promotes 

72
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:03,080
the development of the Internet and 
digital economy as a national priority.

73
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,403
Okay,
so the truth is that the Chinese are 

74
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:11,234
very receptive,
almost passionate about the new digital 

75
00:04:13,851 --> 00:04:14,870
world.
For example,

76
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,510
in China,
more than half of all events tickets are

77
00:04:17,511 --> 00:04:20,300
sold through digital channels.
And what's more surprising,

78
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:25,220
it's estimated that more than 45 percent
of all retailers sell over the Internet.

79
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:27,830
And other good example can be found in 
the fintech sector.

80
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:30,590
That is financial technology services.
So listen to them.

81
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:39,170
According

82
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,003
the consulting firm I research in 2016,
mobile payments in China were worth 

83
00:04:44,101 --> 00:04:44,934
about five point $5,000,000,000,000,
approximately 50 times the United 

84
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,030
States,
$112,000,000,000

85
00:04:51,031 --> 00:04:51,840
market.
Now,

86
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,330
this isn't just about Fintech,
not adult,

87
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:58,290
the truth is that China has begun to 
play a part in almost every sector.

88
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,390
It's very unlikely that in the upcoming 
years,

89
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:01,224
many of the greatest digital and 
technological innovations will be born 

90
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,793
right here in China,
but just a second because don't think 

91
00:05:06,691 --> 00:05:08,820
that this is just some vision of the 
future.

92
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:10,590
It's actually happening right now,

93
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,373
almost one in three Unicorns,
which is what startups valued at more 

94
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,423
than a billion dollars on known as his 
Chinese one in three in the entire 

95
00:05:24,161 --> 00:05:24,994
world.
We're talking about more than 75 

96
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:29,080
companies like the ones you're seeing on
the screen now.

97
00:05:29,110 --> 00:05:30,680
Now you may not have heard of many of 
them,

98
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:31,523
but actually now that I think about it,
you probably haven't heard of most of 

99
00:05:33,671 --> 00:05:34,451
them,
but folks,

100
00:05:34,451 --> 00:05:35,284
they all have something in common.
All of these companies are worth more 

101
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:41,830
than a billion American dollars and 
they're all Chinese.

102
00:05:41,890 --> 00:05:42,723
These companies are all expected to play
a strong role in the world of 

103
00:05:45,281 --> 00:05:45,820
technology.

104
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,770
Okay.

105
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:51,510
To give you an idea of the type of 
company we're talking about,

106
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:54,520
we'll mention the company on this list 
that most of you probably know.

107
00:05:56,910 --> 00:05:57,743
I'm about Dji,
the world's leader in commercial 

108
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:00,713
drainages.
Maybe you know the spark that now the 

109
00:06:01,871 --> 00:06:03,020
care,
the Mavic pro.

110
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:05,300
Well,
it's the company that makes those things

111
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:08,780
along with them,
of course,

112
00:06:08,781 --> 00:06:10,910
is the group of big players,
Alibaba,

113
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:11,900
tencent,
Baidu,

114
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:12,990
me,
Huawei,

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,120
et Cetera,
et cetera.

116
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,003
Yeah,
we could say that silicon valley has a 

117
00:06:16,521 --> 00:06:18,410
new and powerful.
Right,

118
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,320
so allow me to repeat the question that 
I asked at the beginning of the video.

119
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,830
What would you say is the biggest video 
game company in the world?

120
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:28,723
Maybe a French company,
maybe a company located in Silicon 

121
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:31,850
Valley?
Nope,

122
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,683
none of that.
The largest video game company in the 

123
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:37,160
world is ten cent Nasoni non intended.
Not Microsoft,

124
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,900
but tencent.
You see,

125
00:06:39,901 --> 00:06:43,400
even though the company's main business 
has nothing to do with video games,

126
00:06:43,401 --> 00:06:44,234
the company is best known for we chat.
This company makes more than 

127
00:06:46,581 --> 00:06:47,414
$16,000,000,000
worth of video games each year and 

128
00:06:49,971 --> 00:06:53,810
controls more than 10 percent of the 
world wide video game industry.

129
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,643
Right.

130
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,550
Have you ever heard of League of Legends
Clash Royale or candy crush?

131
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,413
Well,
to some extent they're controlled by 

132
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,780
this Chinese company surprised.
Well,

133
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:06,330
you shouldn't be.
Perhaps the best example we can find.

134
00:07:06,420 --> 00:07:07,253
The digital and technological revolution
that China is undergoing exists in what 

135
00:07:10,681 --> 00:07:15,681
is already known as the Silicon Delta.
Check this out the Pearl River Delta,

136
00:07:24,460 --> 00:07:28,600
the Pearl River Delta has become one of 
the most important economic poles on the

137
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:31,000
planet here,
and we can find some of the engines that

138
00:07:31,001 --> 00:07:31,834
explained the impressive growth of this 
region of the world has had in recent 

139
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:35,261
decades.
Among others.

140
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,360
The delta contains places like Hong 
Kong,

141
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,890
Macau,
Fascia and Guangzhou,

142
00:07:38,891 --> 00:07:39,724
and Shenzhen.
While it's precisely Shen Zen's case 

143
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:44,230
that can explain what's happening in 
this part of the world.

144
00:07:44,290 --> 00:07:45,123
See,
Shenzen is a city of more than 12 

145
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,630
million people whose economy has just 
surpassed that of Hong Kong.

146
00:07:54,370 --> 00:07:54,580
What

147
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,413
just three decades ago was no more than 
a fishing village has become a global 

148
00:07:58,960 --> 00:07:59,793
technology epicenter.
To give you an idea of what we're 

149
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:02,854
talking about every single year this 
city registers more international 

150
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:08,170
Peyton's than France or the United 
Kingdom.

151
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:09,790
For example,
ten cent was born here,

152
00:08:09,791 --> 00:08:10,624
the company that owns we chat,
the leading messaging application in 

153
00:08:12,911 --> 00:08:16,840
China and which you can do practically 
everything with in this application.

154
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,733
You can even find real time thermal maps
that show you how busy or shopping 

155
00:08:20,201 --> 00:08:23,590
center is at that very moment.
Just 30 years ago,

156
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:24,513
this Pearl River,
Delta megacity was a mere fishing 

157
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:30,490
village now home to up to 15 million 
people.

158
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:34,780
It hopes to become a tech nirvana for 
the world's hardware startups.

159
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:35,763
The fact is,
this is 1979 when Shen Zen became the 

160
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:38,824
first special economic zone of China.
The city's economy has grown as an 

161
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:42,633
annual average rate of around 22 percent
today as development in growth are 

162
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:49,960
mainly led by digital and technology 
companies.

163
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,693
It's companies like royal that aspires 
to become the world's leader in folding 

164
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,003
touchscreens.
Something that's considered 

165
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,190
indispensable for the future of 
communications.

166
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,433
Because folks,
you can already see it and you China is 

167
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:04,704
emerging.

168
00:09:08,470 --> 00:09:09,303
We're going to have to get used to more 
and more innovations coming from this 

169
00:09:11,291 --> 00:09:13,420
country and of course that's a good 
thing.

170
00:09:13,460 --> 00:09:14,293
Silicon Valley needs some competition 
and that means that in the next few 

171
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,613
years,
the pace of technological development 

172
00:09:18,461 --> 00:09:20,470
will accelerate more and more.
By the way,

173
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:22,840
in a future video,
we're actually going to have a long talk

174
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:25,370
about Alibaba.
Subscribe for Vat,

175

but now it's your turn.
Do you think shen zen will soon overtake

176
00:09:28,361 --> 00:09:31,060
Silicon Valley as the engine of global 
innovation?

177
