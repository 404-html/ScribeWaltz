1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,120
That is video is going to be a bit 
special.

2
00:00:03,121 --> 00:00:03,954
It's a little bit difference.
We're not going to be talking about 

3
00:00:07,111 --> 00:00:08,610
politics today.
Instead,

4
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,210
we actually wanted to tell you a bit 
more about visual policy itself.

5
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:13,103
In other words,
we're going to talk about this channel 

6
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:15,751
because,
well,

7
00:00:15,751 --> 00:00:17,340
we've got some important news to tell 
you.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:27,533
A few weeks ago we marked the one year 
anniversary of this channel and today 

9
00:00:30,361 --> 00:00:31,194
we're well on our way to half a million 
subscribers as every day 100,000 people 

10
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:35,910
view a video.
Now,

11
00:00:35,911 --> 00:00:38,760
whenever you start a new business or a 
youtube channel,

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:40,740
there's always some risk attached to 
that,

13
00:00:40,741 --> 00:00:41,574
and honestly,
we all at visual politic felt that 

14
00:00:43,321 --> 00:00:44,154
starting a political channel on youtube,
it was kind of a particularly big risk 

15
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,900
in forms rather than sensational 
politics on any medium,

16
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:54,990
especially youtube is not exactly eight 
super hot topic.

17
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,480
It's not an exciting blog.
It's not a gaming channel.

18
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:59,880
It's not even top 10 lists,
and quite honestly,

19
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,360
while we hoped it would do well,
we didn't really expect that the channel

20
00:01:03,361 --> 00:01:05,490
would grow in quite the way that it has 
now.

21
00:01:05,491 --> 00:01:08,010
As many of you might know,
this is not my first channel.

22
00:01:08,011 --> 00:01:08,844
In fact,
I have three other youtube projects on 

23
00:01:10,411 --> 00:01:13,110
the go right now,
so well now you might be wondering,

24
00:01:13,111 --> 00:01:15,390
well what made me choose to start this 
one in particular,

25
00:01:15,391 --> 00:01:16,224
what made me think the visual politic 
was a good idea and worth all of the 

26
00:01:19,111 --> 00:01:19,740
risk?
Well,

27
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,810
in this video I want to tell you that 
story.

28
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,280
Wherever you're watching this video 
from,

29
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:38,660
I am willing to bet there is plenty of 
media coverage about politics.

30
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,553
I'm sure there are news outlets and 
political talk shows of all stripes 

31
00:01:43,220 --> 00:01:44,053
satisfying both sides of the political 
spectrum and I really don't want to 

32
00:01:47,751 --> 00:01:48,584
focus on criticism here because many of 
these news outlets do trudy outstanding 

33
00:01:52,551 --> 00:01:53,384
journalism,
but in general there are a couple of 

34
00:01:54,921 --> 00:01:57,710
issues.
The first one is emotion.

35
00:01:57,860 --> 00:02:02,860
The media playbook on politics as that 
people who watch news do save to confirm

36
00:02:03,411 --> 00:02:05,270
their views.
If you're conservative,

37
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:09,410
you'll watch conservative news and the 
exact same thing goes if you are liberal

38
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,273
media,
Gary's will tell you that the way you 

39
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:17,081
make politics appealing is by showing 
emotion and also showing confrontation.

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:18,373
This is exactly why it's so many shows 
tend to exaggerate their political 

41
00:02:21,531 --> 00:02:24,110
positions.
It creates a bigger conflicts.

42
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:26,420
Now the chances are you already knew 
that,

43
00:02:26,421 --> 00:02:27,254
but like I said,
there were a couple of issues here and 

44
00:02:29,090 --> 00:02:32,270
the second one is one that you might not
be so familiar with.

45
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,920
You see,
by definition,

46
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,610
journalists are focused on exceptional 
facts.

47
00:02:37,611 --> 00:02:42,611
Consider this aphorism from journalism.
A dog biting a kid is not newsworthy,

48
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:43,783
but a kid biting a dog is.
This has actually been the cornerstone 

49
00:02:46,881 --> 00:02:49,640
of political news since what kind of 
since forever.

50
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:52,130
Let me give you a more real world 
example here.

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,370
Anytime an oil tanker sinks,
this will hit the news on and on.

52
00:02:55,371 --> 00:02:56,204
Go the extensive reports,
the interviews with experts and all 

53
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:03,310
kinds of extended analysis,
but nobody's talking about the thousands

54
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
of oil tankers that don't sync all of 
the thousands that simply make it to 

55
00:03:07,631 --> 00:03:08,464
their destination on a schedule and 
without problems and display what you 

56
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:13,450
might think from all that media 
coverage,

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,313
those ships,
the ones that go on those regular 

58
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:18,610
journeys,
they are the ones that have a far bigger

59
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:19,444
impact on your life.
Because I'm willing to bet that the 

60
00:03:21,281 --> 00:03:22,114
price of fuel for your car affects you 
far more than that last oil tankers 

61
00:03:26,141 --> 00:03:27,610
sinking off the coast of somewhere.

62
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,473
But the reality is that we build our 
perception of reality based on those 

63
00:03:32,081 --> 00:03:32,914
rare happenings,
not the normal everyday realities of 

64
00:03:35,231 --> 00:03:36,064
life.
And this leads us to not really 

65
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:42,040
understand the reality of life at all.
And now let me give you another example.

66
00:03:42,041 --> 00:03:45,550
This one with a bit more of a visual 
politic flavor Africa,

67
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,580
unless you are a regular visual politic 
view at your mind,

68
00:03:48,581 --> 00:03:52,360
still think of Africa as an entire 
continent full of poverty and misery.

69
00:03:52,361 --> 00:03:53,530
And why is this?
Well,

70
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:55,810
that's because when a journalist talks 
about Africa,

71
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,780
he talks about the exceptional things,
a war in Congo,

72
00:03:58,781 --> 00:03:59,614
corruption in Angola,
starvation in Somalia and on and on and 

73
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:03,790
on.
But economic progress,

74
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,653
it's not some exceptional event.
It's just something that ticks along 

75
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,950
little by little,
day by day,

76
00:04:08,951 --> 00:04:12,610
never really a big enough story to make 
the headlines.

77
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,720
And headlines are what people read 
there.

78
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,740
What people have been conditions to care
abouts.

79
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:20,050
And it's not just Africa.
And that's just a random example.

80
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:21,460
It's the whole world.
I mean,

81
00:04:21,461 --> 00:04:24,130
Austin man on the street,
what the status of the world is today,

82
00:04:24,131 --> 00:04:26,560
and he's probably not going to be full 
of optimism.

83
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:27,430
Well,
it is war.

84
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,360
Well,
it's poverty,

85
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,223
it's corruption.
But do you know what the dog biting the 

86
00:04:30,461 --> 00:04:31,294
kid of this story is?
The oil tanker that arrives safely to 

87
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:34,300
its destination?
Well,

88
00:04:34,301 --> 00:04:38,230
as the simple facts,
but we live in the best time in history,

89
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:41,080
and this is not an optimistic dreamlike 
viewpoint.

90
00:04:41,081 --> 00:04:41,914
It's absolute reality based on facts.
We've got the growing middle class in 

91
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:46,504
Asia,
rick clear path to the elimination of 

92
00:04:47,771 --> 00:04:52,000
starvation in Africa and life expectancy
is higher than ever before,

93
00:04:52,001 --> 00:04:53,820
pretty much everywhere.
Oh,

94
00:04:53,821 --> 00:04:55,720
hope is that if you're watching this 
video,

95
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:58,850
you want a realistic view on the world's
not one salons.

96
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,950
It by popular media desperately needing 
to show you conflicts and demotion,

97
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:07,090
and this isn't just about giving you an 
informed opinion for the sake of it.

98
00:05:07,091 --> 00:05:07,924
It's about giving you an informed 
opinion because many negative elements 

99
00:05:10,601 --> 00:05:14,770
of society take advantage of people who 
believe that the world is in trouble.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,920
Very little is better than that.
Polarizing as society.

101
00:05:17,921 --> 00:05:18,754
It's stirring up populist movements and 
on the micro level even causing us to 

102
00:05:21,911 --> 00:05:24,340
make bad decisions in our day to day 
lives.

103
00:05:24,420 --> 00:05:26,980
All right,
so so far a lot of big talk,

104
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:29,620
but what does visual politic actually 
have to offer you here?

105
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:30,940
Well,
we're here for context.

106
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,800
We're not competing with traditional 
media.

107
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:35,560
We're not trying to get in that 24 hour 
news cycle,

108
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,423
and so get me wrong.
It's absolutely great to be reading 

109
00:05:37,631 --> 00:05:38,464
newspapers and watching TV news.
They're going to tell you the daily 

110
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,494
news,
so we're going to give you the trends 

111
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:45,730
and the movements that are changing our 
entire worlds.

112
00:05:45,790 --> 00:05:46,623
This is why visual policy,
we'd love to compare one country to 

113
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,264
another or dive into the history of a 
situation in depth before we tell you 

114
00:05:52,571 --> 00:05:53,404
what's happening in the present day.
Context is so important and it's so 

115
00:05:56,051 --> 00:05:56,884
often missed by TV news because they 
need to get the story that is breaking 

116
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:01,394
that very moment.
It's the story that's breaking that 

117
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,610
hour.
Even the story,

118
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:04,443
it was breaking that minutes,
but most important of all is that we do 

119
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,664
this while keeping our independence.
Not every media outlet or even youtube 

120
00:06:10,821 --> 00:06:14,660
channel can say this,
but visual politic is 100% independent.

121
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:17,240
There's no think tank behind the scenes 
writing checks.

122
00:06:17,241 --> 00:06:18,074
This new company providing us with a 
fancy office and there's no political 

123
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:22,970
party peddling influence.
There's no hidden agenda here.

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,833
We publish our content in English and 
Spanish and we are funded 100% by our 

125
00:06:27,531 --> 00:06:28,364
own resources.
Because I know you might be wondering 

126
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:32,930
why throughout this video I've talked 
about we rather than just I or me.

127
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,670
And that's because as you can probably 
imagine,

128
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,533
there's a team behind me,
there's a team helping me create the 

129
00:06:37,791 --> 00:06:39,890
best content possible here with four 
people,

130
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,753
if you include myself.
And if you want to see the other guys 

131
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:44,480
behind the team,
check the Spanish language channel,

132
00:06:44,510 --> 00:06:46,790
they present all of the videos over 
there.

133
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:49,520
And this is not some easy job behind the
scenes of every video here.

134
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:52,910
This is between 15 hours and 25 hours of
research.

135
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,650
All of our sources,
double checks,

136
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,100
and we make sure that all of our stories
meet the highest standards.

137
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:00,080
Oh.
And then comes to the actual writing and

138
00:07:00,081 --> 00:07:00,914
the editing and the recording and the 
production and the channel managements 

139
00:07:03,981 --> 00:07:06,260
and as well on and on and on.
All right,

140
00:07:06,261 --> 00:07:07,094
so at a very visual politic way,
let me address a few critics very 

141
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,020
quickly because there's probably people 
wandering in their minds now,

142
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,580
dia really have no viewpoints.

143
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,990
Do you have no bias at all?
I mean,

144
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,200
are you complete fuel and talking about 
each and every issue?

145
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:21,350
And the honest answer there is no.
In fact,

146
00:07:21,351 --> 00:07:24,080
anybody can be completely neutral when 
talking about politics,

147
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:28,820
not even in theory.
From the very moment once opic is chosen

148
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,250
over another appoints already being 
made,

149
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,000
it's just totally inescapable.
So with that in mind is what is our view

150
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:35,834
and what is our bias?
What I think it's probably best 

151
00:07:37,341 --> 00:07:38,174
described in a more positive light as a 
principal and that principal would 

152
00:07:40,341 --> 00:07:43,340
simply be freedom.
We believe freedom should be an absolute

153
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,203
core value of politics,
more specifically respect for the 

154
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:50,690
freedom and the civil rights of people 
to the greatest degree possible.

155
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:53,570
Another principle we stand for is 
cultural understanding.

156
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,404
We've consistently stated that free 
trade between countries and cooperation 

157
00:07:57,561 --> 00:08:01,910
among peoples is the best mechanism for 
peace and prosperity on a global scale.

158
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:04,070
As we've demonstrated in many,
many videos,

159
00:08:04,071 --> 00:08:04,904
the evidence shows that isolationism and
protectionism do not lead to anything 

160
00:08:08,541 --> 00:08:09,590
good.
But finally,

161
00:08:09,591 --> 00:08:12,260
almost important principle is not to be 
dogmatic.

162
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:13,123
Everything we say is fact based and we 
can have our minds changed if someone 

163
00:08:16,491 --> 00:08:17,324
gives us a good reason to change them.
This is why your feedback and your 

164
00:08:19,911 --> 00:08:22,010
comments are so important to our 
projects.

165
00:08:22,011 --> 00:08:22,844
You the viewer,
provide us with new information and new 

166
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,514
sources and many of our videos are made 
simply because one of you contacted us 

167
00:08:28,251 --> 00:08:31,400
with information about the country and 
said we should make a video about it.

168
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,563
So all of that was a really long way for
me to introduce you to something that 

169
00:08:35,121 --> 00:08:37,520
you're probably already know quite a bit
about.

170
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:39,770
But now let me tell you something you 
don't know.

171
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:42,170
Let me tell you where we want to be in 
the future.

172
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,590
We wants to go further.
We want to make more content.

173
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:58,050
We want to make more videos in different
formats.

174
00:08:58,051 --> 00:09:00,930
We want to go to different places around
the world and show them to you.

175
00:09:00,931 --> 00:09:03,930
We want to introduce you to the people 
behind the stories.

176
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:07,050
The people who really are changing the 
world that we live in.

177
00:09:07,170 --> 00:09:08,040
Oh,
and on top of that,

178
00:09:08,041 --> 00:09:11,130
we also want to have our own website 
with more official policy concepts.

179
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,023
In summary,
we want to take visual politic to the 

180
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:14,634
next level and take this community that 
we've built along with us and we need 

181
00:09:18,841 --> 00:09:20,760
your help.
Many of you have asked us already why we

182
00:09:20,761 --> 00:09:23,010
don't have a Patrion page and the truth 
is,

183
00:09:23,011 --> 00:09:25,740
but it's something that we've been 
considering for a really long time.

184
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:28,050
The truth is that we realized that if we
want to do more,

185
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:28,913
we need more and we need a way to do it 
while maintaining independence and now 

186
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:35,100
everyone else who wants to help us can,
if you want to,

187
00:09:35,101 --> 00:09:38,760
you can join us in taking visual politic
to the next level and just quickly,

188
00:09:38,761 --> 00:09:40,200
for those of you who don't know about 
it,

189
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,043
patron is a platform that connects 
creators with those who want to 

190
00:09:43,261 --> 00:09:46,000
contribute financially to that creator 
below.

191
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,110
We're not taking anything away here 
that's really important to say.

192
00:09:49,111 --> 00:09:49,944
The classic visual politic videos that 
we post every week on youtube will 

193
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:54,540
always be available to everyone for 
free.

194
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,550
But now for less than what you pay for a
beer,

195
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,470
you can make all our ideas,
more videos,

196
00:09:58,471 --> 00:09:59,304
more specials,
so websites and even essentially books 

197
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:02,250
or reality.
Further,

198
00:10:02,251 --> 00:10:03,084
if you do contribute,
you're going to get access to exclusive 

199
00:10:04,651 --> 00:10:06,960
contents as well as plenty of other 
surprises.

200
00:10:06,961 --> 00:10:08,820
If you click the link in the description
box below,

201
00:10:08,821 --> 00:10:09,654
you can check it off Patrion page and 
learn more about the goals that we've 

202
00:10:11,971 --> 00:10:12,804
set.
And of course on that page you can 

203
00:10:13,561 --> 00:10:15,600
choose the type of commitment that you 
might want to have.

204
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:16,523
And finally,
I'd like to use this opportunity to 

205
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:19,860
thank you for your support.
Thanks to you,

206
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:20,694
visual politic is possible.
So to everyone who's watched and shared 

207
00:10:23,131 --> 00:10:24,570
our video centers,
music centers,

208
00:10:24,571 --> 00:10:25,404
ideas,
left us comments while big thank you 

209
00:10:26,851 --> 00:10:27,684
from me and the rest of us now I'm sure 
over the next year we're going to 

210
00:10:30,331 --> 00:10:31,164
continue to grow into an even greater 
community with more possibilities and 

211
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:36,600
without you on if that's possible.
So once again,

212
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:39,420
thank you very much and I'll see you in 
the next video.
