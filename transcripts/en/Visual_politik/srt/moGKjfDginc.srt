1
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:08,873
Which about a launch list,
small countries which are more 

2
00:00:09,961 --> 00:00:12,330
successful,
these questions may seem silly,

3
00:00:12,331 --> 00:00:14,490
but if you are,
I guarantee you they are not

4
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:21,360
well that is gaining more and more 
countries,

5
00:00:21,361 --> 00:00:23,670
so obviously countries,
they are becoming smaller.

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,700
Since 1950.
Our wealth has gone from having about 60

7
00:00:26,701 --> 00:00:30,650
countries to having more than 200.
So this may lead to a few questions.

8
00:00:30,651 --> 00:00:32,430
I'll smaller countries,
a good or a bad thing.

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:35,100
Are they more viable in some way?
While these are the questions that we're

10
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:35,934
going to answer in this video,
but first a quick comment when we're 

11
00:00:38,491 --> 00:00:39,324
talking about small countries,
so we need countries where the 

12
00:00:40,561 --> 00:00:43,290
population of fewer than 10 million 
inhabitants,

13
00:00:43,291 --> 00:00:44,124
this includes Hong Kong and Macau 
because even though they are a part of 

14
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,570
China,
they have their own laws,

15
00:00:48,571 --> 00:00:50,500
they have their own courts and customs,
et Cetera.

16
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:51,393
This is a law that grants its citizens' 
rights and freedoms that would be 

17
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,780
unimaginable in any other place in China
with the exception of Macau,

18
00:00:57,781 --> 00:01:00,120
which was integrated into China 
following the same model.

19
00:01:00,121 --> 00:01:02,430
So having several of that,
let's proceed to the key issue.

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,100
What is happening with these small 
countries,

21
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,460
and this is actually a really important 
issue in international politics,

22
00:01:08,461 --> 00:01:09,294
we all knew that a good deal of 
political conflicts have to do with 

23
00:01:11,341 --> 00:01:12,174
precisely this with many territories 
wanting to declare themselves 

24
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:15,623
independent hands become new countries.
Some examples are Scotland's Catalonia 

25
00:01:19,381 --> 00:01:20,250
and go to start

26
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,280
in the small.
There's no doubt here.

27
00:01:30,281 --> 00:01:33,940
Smaller countries don't usually play a 
large role in international news.

28
00:01:33,941 --> 00:01:35,770
They aren't really involved in major 
conflicts.

29
00:01:35,771 --> 00:01:36,604
They don't participate in major decision
making processes and truthfully that 

30
00:01:40,021 --> 00:01:42,610
political news is not usually that well 
known,

31
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,700
but this is all pretty normal.
We all know the presidents of the United

32
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:46,533
States or France or Russia,
who cares about the rules of countries 

33
00:01:48,491 --> 00:01:50,260
like Ireland,
Denmark or Taiwan.

34
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,000
Yes.
Now it's true on visual politic.

35
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:52,834
We tend to talk about them,
but it's not really that common out 

36
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:55,940
there in the room.

37
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:56,773
Real wealth,

38
00:02:00,230 --> 00:02:03,320
despite all of this.
The truth is that in the last 30 years,

39
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,690
if something has characterized smaller 
countries,

40
00:02:05,691 --> 00:02:09,020
is that they do things a lot better than
large countries.

41
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:09,913
In fact,
whenever ranking is published about the 

42
00:02:11,121 --> 00:02:12,950
richest countries,
the most innovative,

43
00:02:12,951 --> 00:02:14,270
most competitive,
happiest,

44
00:02:14,271 --> 00:02:15,700
safest,
all of these things,

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:19,550
small countries almost always occupied 
most of the top positions.

46
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:20,241
Hands,
yeah.

47
00:02:20,241 --> 00:02:21,074
It's usually when we read these rankings
that we kind of noticed there exist and 

48
00:02:23,421 --> 00:02:24,800
we probably ask ourselves,
well,

49
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,230
I want to do.
They do it.

50
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,960
You see,
if we take for example,

51
00:02:33,961 --> 00:02:36,840
the ranking of the richest countries in 
the world,

52
00:02:36,870 --> 00:02:39,600
that is the countries with the highest 
GDP per capita.

53
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:42,930
We find this among the 10 richest 
countries.

54
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:47,990
Nine of them are smaller countries by 
the way,

55
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,013
out of those nine countries,
eight half less than 6 million 

56
00:02:51,331 --> 00:02:52,440
inhabitants.
That is,

57
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,350
they are much smaller than some cities 
like Dallas,

58
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:57,030
Philadelphia,
or Toronto.

59
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:04,400
She's the top 25 countries.
Things they change a bit,

60
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:05,263
but not that much.
Out of the top 25 richest countries in 

61
00:03:07,491 --> 00:03:08,930
the world,
17,

62
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:09,640
all small

63
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,473
countries

64
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:14,563
take price differences into account.
That is if we take the GDP per capita 

65
00:03:17,481 --> 00:03:19,230
pad with purchasing power,
the fact,

66
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:22,310
so even more shockingly one sided in 
that case,

67
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:27,340
14 of the richest territories in the 
welds are all talking about really,

68
00:03:30,961 --> 00:03:31,794
really different countries.
There have a high population density 

69
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:41,070
like Singapore,
others have a really low,

70
00:03:41,071 --> 00:03:41,904
unlike Finland's some also have more 
natural resources like Qatar and others 

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,073
have practically nothing like ours.
Art more agricultural and others are 

72
00:03:51,651 --> 00:03:52,484
more financial.
Some are large and territory and others 

73
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:55,483
are not.
That is to say there is an absolutely 

74
00:03:57,501 --> 00:03:58,334
huge variety,
but they all have one thing in common 

75
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,910
and that's very few in

76
00:04:06,190 --> 00:04:07,490
who told you

77
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,180
about countries like Iceland,
New Zealand,

78
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:10,050
Luxembourg,
Norway,

79
00:04:10,051 --> 00:04:11,100
Ireland,
Denmark,

80
00:04:11,101 --> 00:04:12,060
Singapore,
Austria,

81
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:16,290
Switzerland and Finland.
Here and in 2014 and 2015.

82
00:04:16,291 --> 00:04:17,124
Two studies published by the Credit 
Suisse research units corroborated this 

83
00:04:19,981 --> 00:04:20,814
exact situation.
He studies found that small countries 

84
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:27,570
tend to be richer and more egalitarian 
and more socially advanced.

85
00:04:27,571 --> 00:04:28,590
In fact,
on average,

86
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,260
they invest a lot more in things like 
their education

87
00:04:31,530 --> 00:04:32,363
health.

88
00:04:33,750 --> 00:04:35,880
That wasn't enough.
Small countries tend to have more lawful

89
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:37,230
accounts,
have less debt,

90
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:39,690
less deficits,
and even fewer taxes.

91
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,780
Even if we look at their financial 
markets or stock exchanges.

92
00:04:42,781 --> 00:04:45,240
For example,
we will see it in the last decades.

93
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:48,210
Smaller countries markets have performed
the best.

94
00:04:48,270 --> 00:04:49,103
Have a look at this chart,
so now I'm probably going to voice the 

95
00:04:57,681 --> 00:05:00,740
question that all of you are thinking in
your mind is right now on that swell.

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,800
How on earth is this happening?
Well to success,

97
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:13,770
yes.

98
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:14,603
Do small countries work better than 
large ones on big countries spaced out 

99
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,860
larger markets,
more business opportunities,

100
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:23,250
and a greater ability to take advantage 
of economies of scale.

101
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,650
So what's failing here,
and just before we get into it,

102
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:26,484
I do want to say that I am excluding tax
havens here because that's not really 

103
00:05:29,581 --> 00:05:30,300
fat.
Nivo.

104
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,860
Finland's Austria,
Denmark,

105
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:32,694
or New Zealand for example,
can be considered under any 

106
00:05:34,621 --> 00:05:36,210
circumstances.
Tax Haven.

107
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:43,270
What is the explanation here?
Well,

108
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:45,820
as we usually say visual politic,
that's never a single cause,

109
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,654
but we can see that these countries,
prosperity comes largely from that own 

110
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:51,003
weakness.

111
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:52,680
Yeah,
yeah.

112
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,350
You heard that right?
So these small countries are involved in

113
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,590
more international trade,
not only sell,

114
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,320
but also to buy the products they need a
small country,

115
00:06:00,321 --> 00:06:02,510
obviously they can't produce everything 
they need.

116
00:06:02,540 --> 00:06:05,030
Also,
they are more exposed to competition and

117
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:07,040
the swings of the international 
financial market,

118
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:07,903
yes,

119
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:10,423
forces them to be more prudent with 
their accounts to keep themselves 

120
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:13,450
competitive kinds.
Of course,

121
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,313
since they can't afford them to avoid 
the implementation of protectionist 

122
00:06:17,741 --> 00:06:18,790
policies.
In fact,

123
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:19,643
want to take a look at another data 
point seat 21 out of 25 of the most 

124
00:06:23,051 --> 00:06:23,884
globalized countries.
That is countries that are most open to 

125
00:06:26,201 --> 00:06:29,410
the movements of goods people and 
capital our small country,

126
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,313
yes.

127
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:35,543
Own Hands.
If we want to see how these countries 

128
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,460
economy and his company competitiveness 
work,

129
00:06:38,490 --> 00:06:41,220
we only need to take a look at,
for example,

130
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:44,040
the weld banks doing business index,
which as you know,

131
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:46,890
classifies countries based on that ease 
of doing business.

132
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:50,073
The latest doing business 2018,
which the World Bank published on 

133
00:06:52,361 --> 00:06:56,350
October the 31st 2017 is also dominated 
by small countries.

134
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,460
New Zealand,
Singapore,

135
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,810
Denmark,
and Hong Kong.

136
00:06:58,910 --> 00:06:59,743
Occupied four of the top five places and
among the top 25 countries in the world 

137
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:04,474
for doing business 16,
a small countries and there's something 

138
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:15,290
even more important.
See,

139
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:16,163
small countries tend to have much less 
bureaucracy first because they don't 

140
00:07:19,171 --> 00:07:20,004
need so many political structures or at 
least it's hard to justify them seconds 

141
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:27,630
because citizens tend to be more aware 
of the costs involved and third,

142
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:28,553
because they simply can't.
The role of this is that small 

143
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:36,260
countries,
they tend to be more flexible,

144
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:38,390
more competitive,
and less bureaucratic.

145
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:40,250
Before some of you might be thinking 
right now,

146
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:41,084
well Simon couldn't small countries beat
Richard because they were created 

147
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:45,890
enriched zones and Richard territory.
Well,

148
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:48,170
the honest truth of that is simply no

149
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:49,083
okay.

150
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:53,450
Of Islands,
and there's the case of Singapore,

151
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:54,284
for example,
which just a few decades ago were quite 

152
00:07:56,301 --> 00:08:00,230
poor countries and so on nowadays to 
have the richest countries in the world.

153
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:02,160
Another good example is the old republic
of

154
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,130
a vacuum.

155
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:12,740
Proof of separation.
In 1993,

156
00:08:12,741 --> 00:08:15,350
Czechoslovakia decided to divide into 
two smaller countries,

157
00:08:15,351 --> 00:08:16,580
the Czech Republic and

158
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,633
the vacuum

159
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:21,650
that time both countries which used to 
form Czechoslovakia,

160
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:22,623
suffered the effects of the Soviet 
Union's Fullan's underwent a severe 

161
00:08:25,421 --> 00:08:26,470
transition.
However,

162
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:27,304
despite this the check side,
we're still much richer than the slave 

163
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:30,724
act.

164
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:31,823
In fact

165
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:33,190
is the Vacchio.
The park,

166
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:34,053
as their income was only 65 percent of 
unemployment rates were almost five 

167
00:08:37,281 --> 00:08:39,110
times higher,
and the Slovak Republic,

168
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:39,953
it depended too much on the money that 
came as interregional solidarity from 

169
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,090
the richest parts of the country.
That is the

170
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:46,440
awesome,
well

171
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,980
since they separated in 1993,
both countries have done quite well.

172
00:08:49,981 --> 00:08:50,814
They successfully transitioned from a 
communist model to a capitalist model 

173
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,550
and have both grown considerably more 
than,

174
00:08:56,551 --> 00:08:57,600
for example,
Germany.

175
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,170
Now out of these two countries,
the one that has progressed the most has

176
00:09:01,171 --> 00:09:02,400
been Slovakia.
Yes,

177
00:09:02,401 --> 00:09:05,790
having to organize itself while having 
to compete actually favored the poorest.

178
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:06,653
You can see the clear convergence that 
has occurred between both countries and 

179
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:09,594
the following crop.
We'll explain everything about this in 

180
00:09:15,201 --> 00:09:17,300
an upcoming video.
We're done.

181
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:19,700
We just want to have one last note here.

182
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:26,610
The new world configuration.

183
00:09:28,060 --> 00:09:28,893
Globalization has led to countries with 
a large population no longer having the 

184
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:34,630
upper hand and it's not just that.
The truth is that in this world,

185
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,580
fostering traits such as 
competitiveness,

186
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:37,473
openness and adaptability are becoming 
increasingly important and for the time 

187
00:09:40,541 --> 00:09:45,270
being divvied small countries seem to be
even more efficient at this and not just

188
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,080
small countries,
but even cities.

189
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,370
Yeah,
you heard me right there and I'll.

190
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:51,700
Wells big cities have become the most 
important economic growth

191
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:55,140
drivers just includes

192
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:56,790
London,
New York City,

193
00:09:56,850 --> 00:09:57,750
Hong Kong,
Singapore,

194
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:58,603
Macau cities that playing an 
increasingly important role in our 

195
00:10:00,961 --> 00:10:02,340
world.
The economy of Jakarta,

196
00:10:02,341 --> 00:10:03,174
for example,
grows twice as much as Indonesia as 

197
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:05,694
economy.
New York's GDP is twice that of Sweden 

198
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:08,213
and the countries that have the highest 
percentage of the population living in 

199
00:10:11,101 --> 00:10:15,380
cities tend to be richer.
So that leaves me wondering,

200
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,273
based on that information,
shouldn't we all have that on smaller 

201
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:22,920
decentralized states for even give 
cities some measure of independence?

202
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,180
I'll just leave that thought,
right?

203
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:25,103
Yeah,

204
00:10:27,630 --> 00:10:28,463
of course.
None of this compares to the influence 

205
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:30,744
that the development of supernational 
organizations have to address from 

206
00:10:33,241 --> 00:10:35,790
terrorism to caring for the environment,
but now it's your turn.

207
00:10:35,791 --> 00:10:36,624
What do you think is better wells with 
several small countries or a weld with 

208
00:10:39,511 --> 00:10:42,390
just a few launch one?
