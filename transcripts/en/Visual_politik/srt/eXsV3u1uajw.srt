1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,110
We've already discussed it here on 
visual politic margin.

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,770
Tina is a country where football is 
practically a state religion ends.

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:06,623
We're not a single decade goes by 
without at least one major economic 

4
00:00:10,111 --> 00:00:11,390
crisis.
For decades,

5
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,920
this country has been dominated by a 
political model,

6
00:00:13,921 --> 00:00:17,310
a kind of ideology,
a political current parent ism,

7
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,890
which is something like a mix of 
nationalism,

8
00:00:19,891 --> 00:00:21,990
protectionism and public spending.

9
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:30,870
Lab another job

10
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:37,263
in 2015,
and you governments arrived that have 

11
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:40,044
Mauricio Macri with the mission of 
rebuilding the country from the top to 

12
00:00:43,411 --> 00:00:44,244
the bottom.

13
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:49,660
Joel the same vineyard go there

14
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:01,183
in the 2017 legislative elections.
The Argentine people renewed that trust 

15
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:07,010
in this process.
Basically they came to say,

16
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,750
well,
well done mackery.

17
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:11,270
So the question that has recently arisen
is,

18
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,104
well,
Ms Dot Argentina finally ready once and 

19
00:01:13,941 --> 00:01:15,650
for all for takeoff.
Well,

20
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,970
let's have a look at it.
Shall We?

21
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:26,243
On October the 22nd 2017 elections for 
Congress and the senators were held in 

22
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,774
Argentina.
The government in coalition can be a 

23
00:01:32,361 --> 00:01:33,194
moss,
has an overwhelming triumph with more 

24
00:01:35,311 --> 00:01:36,144
than 10 million votes.
They won 15 out of the 24 electoral 

25
00:01:39,241 --> 00:01:41,040
districts,
including the top five.

26
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,220
These are the most populated one spinal 
surgeries,

27
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,730
providence,
Buenos Aires city,

28
00:01:44,731 --> 00:01:46,110
Cordoba,
Santa Fe,

29
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:46,973
and Mendoza.
Something like that hasn't happened 

30
00:01:48,781 --> 00:01:50,340
since 1985

31
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,243
right

32
00:01:57,940 --> 00:01:59,170
now,
after these elections.

33
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:01,900
Can Gay is close to having an absolute 
majority,

34
00:02:01,901 --> 00:02:05,970
which ensures the government's ability 
to push their reform agenda forward.

35
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:09,490
No.

36
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,833
For this reason,
several analysts have stated that this 

37
00:02:23,191 --> 00:02:26,580
is the true beginning of term,
so after two years of power,

38
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,290
what does mackery done?
What hasn't been done,

39
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,153
and what are his intentions?
You're going to find the answers to all 

40
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,930
of these questions in today's video,
but before we do that,

41
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:35,430
let's take a look back at the history

42
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,270
downfall.

43
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,463
Trigo.
Argentina was one of the richest 

44
00:02:47,711 --> 00:02:50,710
countries in the wells,
even richer than countries like Canada,

45
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:51,730
Australia,
France,

46
00:02:51,731 --> 00:02:52,180
or even

47
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:53,013
Gemini.

48
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:57,920
Not only that,
when World War Two ended in 1945,

49
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,190
this country was along with the United 
States,

50
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:02,470
one of the largest creditors in the 
world,

51
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:03,304
and also one of the largest gold owners 
on the entire planet at that time when 

52
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,764
our salaries,
the Argentine capital was in full swing 

53
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:14,890
and could even rival New York,
but of course having said all of that,

54
00:03:14,891 --> 00:03:16,090
while he might not be wondering,
well,

55
00:03:16,091 --> 00:03:16,924
what the hell happened to Argentina?
Even though things didn't look bad for 

56
00:03:26,221 --> 00:03:27,054
this country after the Second World War?
The truth is that something that was 

57
00:03:29,461 --> 00:03:30,294
already changed.
Great International Crisis of the 19 

58
00:03:34,801 --> 00:03:37,770
thirties affected this country a lot.
Argentina,

59
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:38,604
which was a huge agricultural exporter,
suffers and just had its first major 

60
00:03:42,391 --> 00:03:45,180
financial crisis,
and since that time,

61
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:47,580
all those years ago,
nothing has been the same.

62
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:55,480
Six began to intervene in every economic
and societal feels.

63
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:56,950
Finally,
in 1946,

64
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,010
what we could call it,
the definitive term where it began,

65
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:03,190
the governments of General Ferrell first
and then Ken or Juan Domingo,

66
00:04:03,191 --> 00:04:07,270
Peron approved all kinds of rules and 
laws more than 16,000

67
00:04:07,271 --> 00:04:08,104
in fact,
which puts the economy under state 

68
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:14,731
control,
which for example meant that things like

69
00:04:16,691 --> 00:04:19,360
foreign trade isn't as creation or 
competition,

70
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,620
wouldn't really be a priority instead of
policies such as import substitution,

71
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:26,650
nationalization ends,
launched state enterprises.

72
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,000
They became the order of the day.

73
00:04:32,250 --> 00:04:33,083
This is how a 70 year downfall began,
which made Argentina become one of the 

74
00:04:36,661 --> 00:04:37,494
very few countries that has gone from a 
developed country to a developing 

75
00:04:40,591 --> 00:04:41,424
country economic crisis.
Hyperinflation and payments suspension 

76
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:46,100
has become very,
very common problems.

77
00:04:46,110 --> 00:04:49,350
Talked about in the Argentinian media in
recent decades,

78
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:50,213
and this process culminated with 
coaching tourism from Christina 

79
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:58,460
Fernandez to cut snap man to ruin.
Tell two terms.

80
00:05:10,061 --> 00:05:10,894
As president and Cristina Fernandez de 
[inaudible] set up a model that could 

81
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,120
simply be defined as uneconomical.
Yeah,

82
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:17,013
Argentina.
It was already pretty terrible at 

83
00:05:18,191 --> 00:05:19,480
business,
but Christina,

84
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:21,400
she took it a step further.
See,

85
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:24,960
in CFA is Argentina.
There were capital controls companies,

86
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,600
gonna repatriate their profits,
taxes on companies reached in comparable

87
00:05:28,601 --> 00:05:29,434
proportions in Latin America.
There were lots of restrictions on 

88
00:05:31,391 --> 00:05:32,224
imports and the central bank was only 
dedicated to making money in order to 

89
00:05:36,011 --> 00:05:36,844
finance the governor.
The model was so terribly uneconomic 

90
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,220
that CFA at set up a lot of taxes on 
exports.

91
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:48,083
Yes.
Who would really think of punishing 

92
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:51,510
companies that are exporting,
selling to other countries.

93
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:53,430
It's pretty crazy indeed.

94
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,913
Going to celebrate what he saw.
A ton of posts get Tina independent 

95
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:16,450
dealer Florida or something.
I can't do it,

96
00:06:25,590 --> 00:06:26,423
but that isn't all with Christina at the
helm of the castle respond on the 

97
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:29,444
Argentina Whitehouse.
This country became one of the most 

98
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,424
protectionist in all of Latin America 
and also a country where setting up 

99
00:06:35,701 --> 00:06:36,534
companies was incredibly difficult and 
of course the results they were 

100
00:06:39,421 --> 00:06:42,390
immediate during his second term growth 
was no.

101
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,233
The public deficits sort inflation rose 
to 40 percent investment collapsed and 

102
00:06:47,191 --> 00:06:48,450
suddenly,
again,

103
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:49,343
nothing seemed to be.

104
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:52,570
This is how

105
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:53,403
in December of 2015,
the Argentinian people chose Mauricio 

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,633
Macri,
former presidents of Boca junior as the 

107
00:06:59,231 --> 00:07:01,090
new president of Argentina.

108
00:07:01,530 --> 00:07:06,530
Tito said he didn't see me in the door.
The end,

109
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:09,290
the color can dino.

110
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:24,803
Yeah.
Mauricio Macri is first year at leading 

111
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,890
Argentina.
It wasn't easy.

112
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:31,783
Of course,
this was bound to happen because of the 

113
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,900
terrible state that he inherited the 
country and for example,

114
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,240
he reduced electricity and natural gas 
subsidies,

115
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:40,700
but because reforms never have immediate
results,

116
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,950
things didn't look so great at the 
beginning.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,073
In 2016,
the country suffered a severe recession 

118
00:07:48,271 --> 00:07:50,550
with a GDP drop of two point six 
percent.

119
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:52,950
Inflation also approached 40 percent 
poverty.

120
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:56,250
Unemployment deficits and external debt 
also increased.

121
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:57,203
In other words,
there were ample opportunities to 

122
00:07:58,471 --> 00:08:00,000
criticize mackerel.
I mean,

123
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,310
wasn't he the one who promised that 
things were going to change?

124
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:05,550
Well,

125
00:08:05,550 --> 00:08:08,730
as we said a minute ago,
reforms do not have immediate results,

126
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:13,760
but in the end those changes,
they do arrive in 2017.

127
00:08:16,341 --> 00:08:19,340
The Argentine economy was finally 
showing signs of improvement.

128
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,233
This year's growth may exceed three 
percent in the appetite for investment 

129
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:24,830
is already more than evidence.
Yep,

130
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:27,830
that's right.
It looks like Argentina maybe coming out

131
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:28,550
of that

132
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,550
tunnel.
Philadelphia

133
00:08:38,850 --> 00:08:39,683
being these results have given macri the
great electoral victory that we've just 

134
00:08:43,111 --> 00:08:44,850
seen.
Now we come to the question of,

135
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,710
well,
what exactly did the president do?

136
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:47,603
Well,
basically he reduced all of the crazy 

137
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:50,820
regulations and policies that have been 
put in

138
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,693
place.

139
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:55,710
The new government,
it seemed to work reducing these because

140
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:58,800
in their eyes there was no time to lose.
As soon as he arrived,

141
00:08:58,801 --> 00:08:59,634
he eliminated currency controls.
He allowed foreign investors to 

142
00:09:01,861 --> 00:09:05,220
repatriate their profits,
the eliminated the most incomprehensible

143
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,113
export taxes and reduce subsidies and 
restrictions on imports and all of this 

144
00:09:10,081 --> 00:09:13,080
was with one clear objective,
Argentina,

145
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,900
to recover its productive economy.
Also,

146
00:09:15,901 --> 00:09:16,734
and this is really important here,
mackery reached agreements with some of 

147
00:09:19,021 --> 00:09:19,854
the international investors that 
Argentina hadn't paid in 2001 and with 

148
00:09:23,581 --> 00:09:25,470
whom it's still had judicial fights.

149
00:09:31,310 --> 00:09:35,180
Tina reached an agreement with the 
venture funds after 14 years of struggle

150
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:37,700
in total to cover all the debts with the
funds,

151
00:09:37,770 --> 00:09:40,850
mccree offers $6,500,
million dollars.

152
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:43,760
This agreement implies a 25 percent.
Reduction.

153
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:46,550
On the other hand is the new 
government's approved to kinds of fiscal

154
00:09:46,551 --> 00:09:50,060
amnesty which brought to light new less 
than a hundred and $17.

155
00:09:50,061 --> 00:09:50,894
Billion Dollars.
Intelligent Indians had a broad and did 

156
00:09:52,610 --> 00:09:53,443
not declared,
but before you think this is a huge 

157
00:09:55,221 --> 00:09:56,054
scandal,
do you think about what would happen if 

158
00:09:57,261 --> 00:10:00,680
you were afraid that your savings could 
be confiscated by the government?

159
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:03,320
Sometimes it's not just about not paying
taxes.

160
00:10:03,350 --> 00:10:08,180
When states don't have legal security,
it's easy for money to simply disappear.

161
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,710
The fact is that with all these 
measures,

162
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,544
macaroons,
government has managed to get much of 

163
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:15,080
that money back to Argentina,
and since then there's been an influx of

164
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:17,430
money which has triggered things like 
real estate sales,

165
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:20,330
car sales.
We are breaking records.

166
00:10:20,390 --> 00:10:22,100
More than 700.
80,000

167
00:10:22,101 --> 00:10:25,040
cars have been sold to this day and most
importantly trucks.

168
00:10:25,070 --> 00:10:27,680
This means that production is moving.
Constructionist moving.

169
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,870
Mauricio Macri,
it looks like the engine,

170
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:34,790
quite literally it started again,
looks organ will invest $650,

171
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,670
million US dollars to modernize plants 
in Argentina,

172
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:48,270
but

173
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:50,940
one question arises and that's 
everything,

174
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:51,774
randy.
So exemplary is everything really so 

175
00:10:53,580 --> 00:10:54,540
perfect.
Well,

176
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,403
hold on a minute because the truth is 
that until now the reforms have been 

177
00:10:57,961 --> 00:10:58,794
very,
very gradual than that and had a fairly 

178
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:01,164
limited range,
something in spite of the electoral 

179
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:04,014
results and all those calls to uncork 
the champagne has alerted several 

180
00:11:07,441 --> 00:11:08,274
experts at the moment of truth.
So far he hasn't done much beyond 

181
00:11:11,971 --> 00:11:14,530
removing kitchener ism from power,
which isn't little,

182
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,413
even though he did say that these 
elections are the endorsement for the 

183
00:11:17,761 --> 00:11:19,710
reforms.
We don't really know what they are,

184
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:21,870
what he wants to do.
Carlos Rodriguez,

185
00:11:21,871 --> 00:11:22,920
Braun,
Argentina,

186
00:11:22,921 --> 00:11:25,920
economist.
But why so much distrust?

187
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:26,813
Because despite the reforms we've seen,
it seems that this government is 

188
00:11:29,251 --> 00:11:33,360
struggling to overcome some of the 
typical problems of Argentina's previous

189
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:34,470
governments.
For example,

190
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,650
public spending has not decreased.
It continues to rise and rise,

191
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:39,240
which has caused,
among other things,

192
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:40,103
foreign debt to soul by more than $50,
billion dollars since macri came to 

193
00:11:43,351 --> 00:11:47,610
power and that's not all taxes are 
through the roof.

194
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:48,473
The central bank continues to finance 
the government with new money as 

195
00:11:50,641 --> 00:11:52,770
according to the latest doing business 
reports,

196
00:11:52,771 --> 00:11:54,970
which the ease of doing business in the 
country.

197
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:59,350
Argentina is still way down in 116th 
place.

198
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,221
Now,
to be fair,

199
00:12:05,221 --> 00:12:07,800
we can see the macro has pretty good 
excuses.

200
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:08,663
First is that not much time has passed 
and second is political position in 

201
00:12:11,641 --> 00:12:14,090
Congress in the Senate was very weak 
now,

202
00:12:14,091 --> 00:12:14,924
but after these last elections,
all of that is finally over reformist 

203
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,593
agenda.

204
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:30,250
It seems that often has crushing 
electoral trump.

205
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:35,280
President Macri has made it clear we are
entering a stage of permanent reformism.

206
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,453
Argentina doesn't have to stop.
It doesn't have to fear reforms because 

207
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:40,510
to reform is to grow,
to evolve,

208
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:44,020
to progress the ratio mccree.
He certainly has a task out of him,

209
00:12:44,021 --> 00:12:46,480
which is somewhat complicated.
Well,

210
00:12:46,481 --> 00:12:48,010
what are his priorities?
Well,

211
00:12:48,011 --> 00:12:48,844
fundamentally view at first,
it's something that is as popular as it 

212
00:12:52,301 --> 00:12:55,660
is necessary,
reducing public deficits and controlling

213
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:59,620
inflation which are ultimately related.
Then he's going to get Argentina back to

214
00:12:59,621 --> 00:13:02,950
being a competitive and attractive 
country in which to invest.

215
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:03,843
To achieve this,
it has promised to approve a tax reform 

216
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:06,453
that reduces taxes on businesses and the
labor reform that facilitates hiring as 

217
00:13:10,061 --> 00:13:10,894
well as more free trade agreements.
Argentina and Chile signed the most 

218
00:13:14,051 --> 00:13:16,510
ambitious free trade agreement in 20 
years.

219
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,160
Then pension,
educational,

220
00:13:18,161 --> 00:13:20,350
and infrastructure reforms.
The next yes,

221
00:13:20,351 --> 00:13:23,500
we can assess and say the macro has a 
lot of work to do if you want us to meet

222
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:25,480
the high expectations that have been 
placed

223
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:29,090
on him.
In any case,

224
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:33,590
it does seem as if a new political and 
economic era has begun the entre.

225
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:35,760
Tina,
a good example is [inaudible] commitment

226
00:13:35,761 --> 00:13:36,594
to reducing poverty by formalizing and 
extending property to the most 

227
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:40,614
disadvantaged.
Argentina delivers housing certificates 

228
00:13:43,081 --> 00:13:43,914
to one point 5 million people in slums.
Government will give them the documents 

229
00:13:47,761 --> 00:13:50,790
to access water and electricity legally.
By the way,

230
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:53,610
we will be discussing how to find 
poverty in a future video.

Subscribe for now.
The question is,

232
00:13:55,891 --> 00:13:58,140
will this country become great?
Once again,

233
00:13:58,170 --> 00:13:59,003
if they manage to deepen their reforms 
and take advantage of all their 

234
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:02,490
opportunities,
it's not trans.

235
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:05,010
The lithium industry,
which we've discussed previously.

236
00:14:05,070 --> 00:14:05,903
I have little doubt that this will be 
the case and now we want to know what 

237
00:14:08,371 --> 00:14:12,240
you think will Argentina become a great 
example for the rest of Latin America?

238
00:14:12,270 --> 00:14:13,103
