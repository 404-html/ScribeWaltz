1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,150
Venezuela is undergoing some of its 
worst moments.

2
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,013
This disaster is so huge that what was 
once one of the largest and most 

3
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:07,914
powerful oil companies in the world,
PDVSA is now practically bankrupt and 

4
00:00:12,061 --> 00:00:15,360
has more problems including extracting 
the oil.

5
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,223
So how does the oil company with the 
largest reserves in the world have 

6
00:00:19,651 --> 00:00:21,210
problems extracting?
Yes.

7
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:24,350
Well that's what we're going to talk 
about in today's video,

8
00:00:32,590 --> 00:00:33,423
folks.
I think we all probably know it's 

9
00:00:35,441 --> 00:00:36,274
Venezuela is undergoing a true 
catastrophe and not only an economic 

10
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:41,194
one,
it is above all a humanitarian 

11
00:00:42,971 --> 00:00:47,971
catastrophe.
It's such a huge disaster that in recent

12
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,710
years it has caused between three and 4 
million Venezuelans to flee the country.

13
00:00:54,740 --> 00:00:57,320
That's more than one in every 10 
inhabitants.

14
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,540
And the truth is we're not really 
surprised by this.

15
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,970
Si,
according to the latest statistics,

16
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:02,863
80 at 7% of the population that's nearly
nine out of every 10 Venezuelans are 

17
00:01:06,801 --> 00:01:08,210
poor.
And on top of that,

18
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,960
most of Venezuela's population,
60% isn't only poor.

19
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,080
They live in extreme poverty.
Not only that,

20
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:21,853
Venezuela is burning down according to 
data from the Venezuelan social 

21
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:28,520
conflict.
Observe a treat in 2017 almost 10,000

22
00:01:28,521 --> 00:01:30,560
protests were registered throughout the 
country.

23
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:34,370
More than 27 per day.
And what's even worse than this?

24
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,300
Well,

25
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:43,770
according to information from Attorney 
General Luis Ortega,

26
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,510
since 2015 the police,
the national guard,

27
00:01:46,540 --> 00:01:51,520
the army as the different intelligence 
services have killed more than 8,000

28
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,570
people.
Of course,

29
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,580
most of them were opposes to the right

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:59,530
Jesus Christ.

31
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:01,060
Hunger,
violence,

32
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,150
repression,
everything indicates that Venezuela will

33
00:02:04,151 --> 00:02:04,984
soon undergo a refugee crisis of 
colossal dimensions because let's be 

34
00:02:09,011 --> 00:02:11,200
clear their view,
and let's be honest,

35
00:02:11,260 --> 00:02:12,320
things they're not looking good.

36
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:14,640
You see,

37
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,980
for years the Bolivarian Revolution of 
Chavez,

38
00:02:16,981 --> 00:02:17,814
Maduro and company has a great ally and 
there we're not too worried about Cuba 

39
00:02:20,851 --> 00:02:23,220
or Russia or any other country.
As a matter of fact,

40
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,083
we're talking about oil.
The black gold that financed the 

41
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:30,150
revolution for a long time,
the huge income,

42
00:02:30,151 --> 00:02:33,240
this raw material brought,
financed all of the regimes,

43
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,350
policies,
ends.

44
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,000
They didn't really care about the 
consequences.

45
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,591
So,
I mean,

46
00:02:38,591 --> 00:02:39,424
factories were closing,
foreign investment was fleeing the 

47
00:02:41,621 --> 00:02:42,454
country,
but it didn't matter because while they 

48
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,600
have loads and loads of money from all 
of that oil,

49
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:48,930
but all of that,
well it's about to end.

50
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:51,550
Yup.
Venezuela does have a lot of oil,

51
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:56,551
but one thing is having oil and another 
thing is being able to exploit set oil.

52
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:01,450
Did you know that Pdvsa the national our
is practically about to collapse.

53
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:02,410
Well,
listen,

54
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:07,411
up the fall of pedevesa petroleum of 
Venezuela,

55
00:03:15,181 --> 00:03:16,014
PDVSA was created by government decree 
in 1976 do you integrate all the oil 

56
00:03:20,191 --> 00:03:21,024
assets that the state had nationalized 
this company soon became a world class 

57
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:30,410
colossus as you know.
Why?

58
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,390
Well,
among other things,

59
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:34,224
because this company has the largest 
reserves on the planet as when we say 

60
00:03:37,741 --> 00:03:40,320
large,
we mean large.

61
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,154
There are more than 300 billion barrels 
of oil certified here more than the 

62
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:46,650
reserves of Saudi Arabia,
the Emirates,

63
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,900
Russia,
or any other oil power.

64
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,381
Now,
yes,

65
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:51,300
it is true and we have set it on this 
channel before.

66
00:03:51,301 --> 00:03:53,850
Venezuelan oil doesn't have the highest 
quality,

67
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:54,684
but that doesn't really matter.
We're talking about a huge amount of 

68
00:03:57,241 --> 00:03:59,880
resources,
almost 20% of the world's noon

69
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:00,973
herbs,

70
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,383
and the fact is that this company paid 
evasive peaks in production in 1998 a 

71
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:10,800
year before Hugo Chavez came to power,
at which time the company was extracting

72
00:04:10,801 --> 00:04:13,530
three and a half million barrels per 
day.

73
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:15,930
Since then,
things have changed a lot.

74
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:16,793
By the year of Hugo Chavez death in 2013
production had decreased by 1 million 

75
00:04:21,391 --> 00:04:26,391
barrels per day day.
So could it be that Hugo Chavez bothered

76
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,750
area and government didn't like oil?
Could it all be part of a twisted,

77
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,220
bland,
do diversify Venezuelan economy?

78
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,350
Well,
in fact,

79
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:40,351
it's quite the opposite.
If he had known me,

80
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:43,453
do you want me [inaudible] petroleum 
Hugo Chavez to increase production to 5 

81
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:55,950
million barrels?
The problem was that they simply weren't

82
00:04:55,951 --> 00:04:58,010
able to do it.
But if you think that that command,

83
00:04:58,011 --> 00:05:01,170
his results were bad,
you haven't seen anything.

84
00:05:01,171 --> 00:05:02,004
Yes,
because since Nicolas Maduro came to 

85
00:05:03,151 --> 00:05:05,820
power,
production has sunk to 1.8

86
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,520
million barrels.
That means like while countries like the

87
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:10,650
United States of doubles their 
production,

88
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:14,790
Venezuela produces half as much oil has 
when the revolution began.

89
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:15,653
So hardly a fantastic success.
And if you think that that's the worst 

90
00:05:31,191 --> 00:05:32,030
of it,
get prepared.

91
00:05:32,031 --> 00:05:35,660
Do you think again,
because the future is looking a lot more

92
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:37,070
bleak.
So at this point in the video,

93
00:05:37,071 --> 00:05:38,090
you might be wondering,
well,

94
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:40,070
what on earth is going on with paid a 
visa?

95
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:49,230
The keys of a disaster for toll.

96
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,520
Okay,
databases.

97
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,373
History.
Divya has been the story of a disaster 

98
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,030
for tolls.
The best example of that,

99
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,973
the Power wanna refining complex,
which consists of three crude oil 

100
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:01,664
refineries and just one of the three 
largest complexes of its kind in the 

101
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:05,684
entire world.
For years it was Venezuela's industrial 

102
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:09,740
pride,
the crown duel,

103
00:06:09,741 --> 00:06:10,610
if you will.
However,

104
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,473
today it barely operates at 15% capacity
and all kinds of accidents tend to 

105
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:16,754
happen.
Well,

106
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:19,340
why is this?
There's no maintenance.

107
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:22,250
They sucked everything they could from 
pedevesa without investing,

108
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,580
there's nothing left to squeeze.
Publishes Pedis Plant Operator,

109
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,533
and this is certainly not an 
extraordinary case at the end of 

110
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,930
October.
Also in the [inaudible] refining complex

111
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,903
and why refineries spills over 200,000
gallons of gasoline into the bay a few 

112
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,980
days later,
another refinery in the complex,

113
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:40,814
the card on refinery itself to fire that
fireman could barely contain because 

114
00:06:43,851 --> 00:06:46,330
they didn't even have the foam to fight 
the flame.

115
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:48,863
Yeah,

116
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:50,323
long and on and on it goes because the 
truth is that most of the old companies 

117
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:54,693
facilities are in terrible condition.
So how do you think that they reached 

118
00:06:57,581 --> 00:07:02,581
this point?
You see,

119
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:10,640
the Chavez government always saw paid a 
vase,

120
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:11,474
a as I kind of dairy cow from which they
could get all the resources they needed 

121
00:07:15,151 --> 00:07:17,980
for the revolution.
The problem is that the oil industry,

122
00:07:17,981 --> 00:07:20,520
it requires lots and lots of 
investments,

123
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:21,383
and these are investments that the 
Venezuelan government simply did not 

124
00:07:23,701 --> 00:07:28,610
want to make.
Even with that fact,

125
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:31,220
it's still indebted the company to the 
Brim.

126
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,980
And by the way,
do you know how indebted this company is

127
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:34,790
today?
Well,

128
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:35,623
listen to this,
we're not talking about one or 5 

129
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,623
billion.
We're talking about 90 billion American 

130
00:07:40,671 --> 00:07:41,504
dollars.
A fortune so big that Venezuela could 

131
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,340
have even bought multinationals like 
Goldman Sachs,

132
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:47,420
Nike or semen

133
00:07:51,350 --> 00:07:52,183
is just an insane amount of debt.
But do you think there's a that's going 

134
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,550
on?
Well,

135
00:07:55,580 --> 00:07:56,413
not even close.
They also use the company to plug in 

136
00:07:58,521 --> 00:08:01,340
place and hire thousands and thousands 
of supporters,

137
00:08:01,341 --> 00:08:04,010
friends and family members around which 
paid a visa,

138
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:07,580
lost even more resources.
And if that wasn't enough,

139
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,414
the Chavez regime also placed unskilled 
and inexperienced personnel in 

140
00:08:11,451 --> 00:08:15,560
management positions while dismissing 
and driving away thousands and thousands

141
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:18,680
of experienced employees because of that
political beliefs.

142
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:19,543
Yes,
this is how pdvsa ran out of money and 

143
00:08:21,531 --> 00:08:24,830
ran out of human resources.
And now with all of this information,

144
00:08:24,831 --> 00:08:28,190
we can really understand why oil 
production is dropping in Venezuela.

145
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:30,140
And of course the consequences of all of
this.

146
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:31,490
Well,
they're terrible for the country.

147
00:08:38,970 --> 00:08:40,140
The consequences

148
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:45,520
oil is essential for the Venezuelan 
economy,

149
00:08:45,521 --> 00:08:48,850
especially because there's no other 
industry left standing.

150
00:08:48,910 --> 00:08:53,770
That dependence on oil is so great that 
it generates 95% of all foreign currency

151
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:58,650
profits in dollars and these currencies,
div Ua,

152
00:08:58,710 --> 00:08:59,543
I won't finish.
Swayla needs to be able to import food 

153
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:01,950
medicine,
gasoline.

154
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,850
Yes,
indeed.

155
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,820
When I swayla still today has to import 
gasoline as well.

156
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:06,663
There's pretty much everything else,
but of course there's oil production 

157
00:09:08,431 --> 00:09:09,264
keeps plummeting.
The country is able to import less 

158
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,624
thing.
Yeah,

159
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,063
and you know what?
Since Venezuela is producing nothing 

160
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:21,220
fantastic,
we import everything.

161
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:24,970
The dwindling oil money is no longer 
enough to pay all the bills.

162
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,440
But of course,
as you will know,

163
00:09:26,470 --> 00:09:29,350
when you spend more money than you make,
money goes away.

164
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,480
And that's precisely what's happening to
Venezuela,

165
00:09:31,510 --> 00:09:32,343
which according to some calculations,
valley has $10 billion in foreign 

166
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:38,620
reserves,
which is that lowest number in 40 years.

167
00:09:38,650 --> 00:09:39,483
This means that when the money is gone,
they won't be able to import anything 

168
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,190
else than what they can buy with the 
money they make from the oil,

169
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:46,053
which she is decreasing.
So you're probably beginning to see the 

170
00:09:48,431 --> 00:09:49,264
problem.

171
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,653
Yeah.

172
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:55,230
Previously talked about on visual 
politic.

173
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,064
I'm Nicolas Maduro,
has government has tried to buy time by 

174
00:09:57,791 --> 00:10:01,870
resorting to international markets to 
issue desk has pretty scandalous rates,

175
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:02,763
sometimes as high as 40% obviously issue
in debt with implicit rates of 40% can 

176
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:11,320
only mean future ruin ends.
In any case,

177
00:10:11,380 --> 00:10:13,930
that's actually no longer a possibility.
In fact,

178
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,793
both of the Venezuelan government and 
Pedevesa are incurring defaults that is 

179
00:10:18,481 --> 00:10:19,314
a on not paying that debt.
I said Pete downgrades seven sovereign 

180
00:10:23,651 --> 00:10:27,070
Venezuelan bonds to the default level 
and other they attempted was that of the

181
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:31,900
Chinese rescue and the Chinese answers 
and place more than $23 billion in loans

182
00:10:31,901 --> 00:10:32,734
on the table.
Everything has a limit and they are no 

183
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:39,580
longer willing to continue giving more 
money and getting nothing in return.

184
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:40,523
Let me just check this out.
The Chinese oil companies seen OPEC 

185
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:46,210
sue's pit of Essa for unpaid debts.
The situation,

186
00:10:46,211 --> 00:10:47,044
dear viewer,
is so desperate that the Cuban 

187
00:10:48,161 --> 00:10:48,994
government has decided to seize the 49% 
that paid a visa held in a Cuban 

188
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:55,320
refinery is compensation for that unpaid
debts.

189
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:55,950
Yep.
Yeah,

190
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:56,783
that right.
Not even Cuba trusts the maduro regime 

191
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:03,310
and it was all of this that led to the 
latest Chavista events for Petro.

192
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:09,743
Yep.

193
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,510
Venezuelan,
crypto currency.

194
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,093
As we've seen with everyday that passes,
the Venezuelan government has less 

195
00:11:16,921 --> 00:11:17,754
access to foreign currency,
which is obviously a huge problem 

196
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:23,070
because without a foreign currency they 
can't import,

197
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,410
but based on this problem and idea came 
up,

198
00:11:25,411 --> 00:11:26,244
cryptocurrency is in fashion,
so why not launch their own 

199
00:11:28,441 --> 00:11:29,274
cryptocurrency?
While they did and they called it the 

200
00:11:31,021 --> 00:11:31,700
petro

201
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,533
not good enough.
They're not going to be good for the 

202
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:46,960
older.
Maybe your mountain tell too,

203
00:11:46,961 --> 00:11:47,794
because

204
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:53,680
course the petro is a very particular 
currency among other things because it's

205
00:11:53,681 --> 00:11:56,290
controlled by Maduro is governments 
under these conditions.

206
00:11:56,291 --> 00:11:57,124
Let me ask you a question.
Would you be willing to invest a single 

207
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:02,440
euro or a single dollar into this new 
crypto currency?

208
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,900
In other words,
would you put your money in the hands of

209
00:12:04,901 --> 00:12:06,670
the Venezuelan government?
Well,

210
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:07,683
you can bet that I would and not even a 
single penny and precisely because no 

211
00:12:15,691 --> 00:12:17,760
one in their right mind would do such a 
thing.

212
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,640
The Venezuelan government as hat due 
back.

213
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:25,641
This particular cryptocurrency with oil 
that is each petro will be guaranteed by

214
00:12:25,921 --> 00:12:29,280
a barrel of oil from the Venezuelan oil 
reserves preserves.

215
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:32,370
That of course are still undergrounds in
this way.

216
00:12:32,371 --> 00:12:36,090
If he petros value as apparently linked 
to the value of this raw material

217
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,100
[inaudible] and you can get fairly Paco 
[inaudible].

218
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,263
Does that sound any better?
Well hold on for either because we 

219
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:52,960
cannot forget a detail,
a very,

220
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:53,794
very important detail.
They are reserves are of course under 

221
00:12:56,981 --> 00:12:59,170
the control of the government.
As I wonder,

222
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,033
do you really think that this government
is going to exploit those reserves and 

223
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,053
even if they did,
do you think that really back the petro 

224
00:13:05,890 --> 00:13:07,610
and what about the support rates?
We didn't,

225
00:13:07,630 --> 00:13:08,463
the resources generated some DB spends,
wouldn't they impose restrictions or 

226
00:13:11,621 --> 00:13:13,100
regulations that would benefit?
Yeah.

227
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,093
Them.

228
00:13:16,350 --> 00:13:18,780
Why take the risk of investing in 
Petros?

229
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:21,510
And by the way,
another important point here that petro,

230
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:22,373
it's not convertible.
That is to say even though it is 

231
00:13:23,821 --> 00:13:27,600
supposedly backed by oil barrels,
you can never exchange it for the barrel

232
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:31,020
or any title that proves a right over 
those barrels.

233
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,840
The Petros a cryptocurrency that isn't 
crypto,

234
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,030
that it's backed by reserves that aren't
reserves.

235
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,750
It's going only be monetized or the 
production that is collapsing and issued

236
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,720
by a government that is in default and 
has no dollars.

237
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:45,660
Francisco Menotti,
professor at the rice universities,

238
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,670
Baker Institute in Houston,
folks,

239
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,400
the battery doesn't seem to be anything 
more than a last ditch.

240
00:13:50,401 --> 00:13:51,234
Attempts to gain time and try to obtain 
the greatest possible number of dollars 

241
00:13:54,271 --> 00:13:55,104
by taking advantage of the popularity of
cryptocurrencies and perhaps of capitol 

242
00:13:58,771 --> 00:13:59,604
laundering because well,
who would put their dollars on the 

243
00:14:01,501 --> 00:14:02,334
table?

244
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:08,580
Fact is that if this crypto it doesn't 
work in,

245
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:11,700
that does look like the most plausible 
scenario Madora his regime.

246
00:14:11,730 --> 00:14:13,660
Well only have three options.
First,

247
00:14:13,661 --> 00:14:17,190
accept some kind of internal revolts and
leave power one way or another,

248
00:14:17,191 --> 00:14:18,024
which seems very difficult.
Second views and even tougher hands and 

249
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:24,510
condemn Venezuela to even greater 
humanitarian disaster or third,

250
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:25,373
try to get the Chinese and Russians to 
by the country's national resources on 

251
00:14:28,261 --> 00:14:31,140
mass hands.
By all means trust that refineries,

252
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,003
that oil and maybe other raw materials.
That is to say they would essentially 

253
00:14:34,591 --> 00:14:35,424
become a sort of colony by selling at a 
loss each and every one of their crown 

254
00:14:38,971 --> 00:14:39,804
jewels so that the regimes are leads,
can continue to enjoy their standard of 

255
00:14:42,481 --> 00:14:43,530
living.
So now today,

256
00:14:43,531 --> 00:14:44,364
Nicolas Maduro in company,
they're still in power and it hardly 

257
00:14:46,591 --> 00:14:49,500
seems likely the Venezuela is going to 
have a better future,

258
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:50,363
but now it's your sound.
Would you be willing to exchange your 

259
00:14:51,951 --> 00:14:52,784
money for that?
Trey's well leave your answer in the 

260
00:14:53,841 --> 00:14:56,240
