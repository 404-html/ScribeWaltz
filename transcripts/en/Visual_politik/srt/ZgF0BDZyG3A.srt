1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,323
Tom's approach towards Russia has been 
one of the most controversial parts of 

2
00:00:11,551 --> 00:00:12,384
his short time in office so far.
It seems that the US president wants to 

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:16,950
develop a new friendship with this old 
rival.

4
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,813
The thing is that this isn't breathing 
so easy and that's because Beijing is 

5
00:00:21,211 --> 00:00:22,044
standing between them,
Russia who's in Moscow without any 

6
00:00:24,601 --> 00:00:25,434
doubt.
One of the most controversial issues is 

7
00:00:26,821 --> 00:00:30,600
the fascination trump seems to have with
Russia and its charismatic leader,

8
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,690
Vladimir Putin,
insinuations messages of support and the

9
00:00:33,691 --> 00:00:34,524
election of senior officials who were 
close to the Kremlin years met with 

10
00:00:36,961 --> 00:00:41,170
Russian President Vladimir Putin and the
Kremlin gave him the order of friendship

11
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:41,820
and $2,000.

12
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,653
13,
the new administration to where it is 

13
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,690
just being shaped right now.
It is absolutely a gift for him.

14
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:50,730
He couldn't have dreamed about anything 
like that just a few months ago.

15
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:51,683
The question really is,
is trump trying to seduce the Russian 

16
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:58,230
leadership or as some are saying,
is there something suspicious about this

17
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,064
developing relationship?
It would be fair to say that trump's 

18
00:01:00,721 --> 00:01:04,390
approach to Russia could have an 
explanation according to some analysts,

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,253
advisors in the White House may have 
told trump to try to be remembered and 

20
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:08,843
make history by being the leader who has
the same success with Russia as Nixon 

21
00:01:12,691 --> 00:01:14,400
and Kissinger had with Chinese

22
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Nixon's had used his mouth China on the 
20th,

23
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:22,300
first of February,
1972.

24
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,140
One of the most important events in 
decades took place that day.

25
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,033
Richard Nixon arrived in Beijing.
It was the first ever visits you've 

26
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:31,990
communist China by a US

27
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:32,873
president

28
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:41,320
for Nixon on unknowns there for 
maintain.

29
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:45,280
The entire trip was broadcast around the
world and it was major,

30
00:01:45,281 --> 00:01:48,070
major news.
Millions of people held their breaths as

31
00:01:48,071 --> 00:01:48,904
they saw Nixon descending the stairs of 
Air Force One and setting force in the 

32
00:01:52,301 --> 00:01:53,650
Chinese capital city

33
00:01:54,310 --> 00:01:55,143
generations in the years ahead.
We'll look back and thank for this 

34
00:02:00,791 --> 00:02:02,700
meeting that we have in this past week.

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,033
We continue.
Let's actually go back at this and see 

36
00:02:06,901 --> 00:02:07,734
what this visit really met.
What were the goals of this visits and 

37
00:02:10,291 --> 00:02:12,730
what made it possible.
So we're going to travel back in time,

38
00:02:12,731 --> 00:02:15,150
but so you October the first 19,
49,

39
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,160
this was the date that China was 
declared,

40
00:02:17,161 --> 00:02:17,994
I think People's Republic of China,
the Communists led by now had one the 

41
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,420
Chinese civil war,
and they took power of this new country.

42
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,230
This new regime was completely hostile 
to Washington DC.

43
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:29,123
In fact,
only a year later trips of the Chinese 

44
00:02:30,841 --> 00:02:31,674
army,
you participated in the Korean War to 

45
00:02:32,911 --> 00:02:33,744
support Pyongyang's regime,
therefore confronting the US faced as a 

46
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:42,880
result of this better runs,
violent fight,

47
00:02:42,881 --> 00:02:45,160
and did thousands of casualties on each 
side.

48
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:48,550
There were no intentions of establishing
any diplomatic relations.

49
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:52,540
It would be fair to say that from that 
time on China in the US were enemies.

50
00:02:54,350 --> 00:02:55,670
You have to move in this neighborhood.

51
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:01,563
In the meantime though,
relations between Beijing and Moscow 

52
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,900
with very,
very different.

53
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:08,100
It is true that Mao had never goes on 
with the Soviet leaders who had,

54
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,953
by the way,
you supported other people to be the 

55
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:12,130
leader of the Chinese Communist Party.
However,

56
00:03:12,131 --> 00:03:12,964
despite all of these differences,
a Russian Chinese alliance was almost 

57
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:17,470
inevitable.
On the one hand,

58
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:21,550
the Soviet Union needed to control or at
least influence the other grades,

59
00:03:21,551 --> 00:03:23,080
communist power.
On the other hand,

60
00:03:23,110 --> 00:03:26,520
Mao's China desperately needed the USSR 
for economic,

61
00:03:26,530 --> 00:03:28,690
technological as well as military 
support.

62
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:33,280
The support was so generous in fact that
between the in 1954 in 1959,

63
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:37,810
the Ussr spent seven percent of the 
government's resources assisting China.

64
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,811
It's even say that this was the largest 
technological transfer in fight.

65
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:46,483
All of this differences started to 
emerge in almost every part of their 

66
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:50,174
relationship and the alliance got weaker
and weaker until well that completely 

67
00:03:53,331 --> 00:03:55,840
broke apart relations.
We're getting very census.

68
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,050
There was the assault of the US embassy 
in Beijing in 1967,

69
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:05,080
and then the first armed encounter took 
place in 1970 disease.

70
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,820
When numerous during this fight,
a few days later,

71
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:17,790
the Soviet bombarded Chinese troops 
deployed in the area.

72
00:04:17,870 --> 00:04:18,703
The conflict didn't go any further,
but for days there was a feeling in the 

73
00:04:21,101 --> 00:04:23,880
air that this could be the start of a 
significant war.

74
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,743
Moscow even considered sending troops 
from the Warsaw Pact countries which 

75
00:04:27,361 --> 00:04:28,194
remain your objective

76
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,293
two,

77
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:34,260
so you said that's in order to prevent a
potential nuclear attack by Russia.

78
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:35,123
Nixon contacted Moscow to make it 
perfectly clear that the US would never 

79
00:04:38,371 --> 00:04:39,204
accept something like that happening 
under any circumstances in the 

80
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:50,924
interrelations between these two.
Communist nations broke down completely 

81
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,020
at the time that both Nixon and his 
famous national security advisor,

82
00:04:57,021 --> 00:04:57,854
Henry Kissinger,
just only need to take a famous saying 

83
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:05,201
and make it their own one over my enemy 
is my friend,

84
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,103
and once that said that they started to 
put it into action and two years later 

85
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:15,260
Nixon was in Beijing relations between 
the USA and China and moved on slowly.

86
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,193
In fact,
it wasn't until 1979 with Jimmy Carter 

87
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:21,750
in office that full relations with the 
nation were established,

88
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:22,673
but the truth is that Nixon's trip to 
China made room for a period of 

89
00:05:25,711 --> 00:05:28,350
successful relationships between the two
nations.

90
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,243
In 1972 bilateral trade between the two 
nations didn't even reach a billion 

91
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:36,900
dollars.
Today the number is close to 600.

92
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,273
Really

93
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,883
things have been relatively friendly and
the US also made a solid ally against 

94
00:05:45,041 --> 00:05:50,041
the Soviet Union during the Cold War.
According to some analysts.

95
00:05:52,861 --> 00:05:55,560
That's what trump is trying to achieve 
with Russia.

96
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:59,060
The reenactment,
Nixon and strategy for Beijing,

97
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,433
Moscow.
This would explain the pro Russian 

98
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,744
attitude of the current president's 
things are very much different now than 

99
00:06:06,051 --> 00:06:07,940
they were in 1969

100
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:14,320
enrollments between China,
Russia,

101
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:16,933
relations between China and Russia have 
started to improve since the end of the 

102
00:06:19,521 --> 00:06:23,330
19 eighties with some treaties and 
agreements being signed here and that,

103
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,320
but it all changed when Xi Jinping came 
to power in 2012.

104
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:30,320
Since then,
relations have advanced quickly consider

105
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:31,154
what was said in 2016 by one of the 
major players in the Chinese 

106
00:06:34,221 --> 00:06:35,054
government's the profundity ends.
The level of coordination between both 

107
00:06:38,601 --> 00:06:42,320
countries has reached a level we have 
never seen before and it's.

108
00:06:42,321 --> 00:06:43,154
Beijing seems to be certain about one 
thing and alliance between China and 

109
00:06:46,011 --> 00:06:49,600
Russia would be very powerful from any 
perspective today.

110
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:52,850
Both countries are cooperating like 
they've never cooperated.

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:06:59,333
Thousand and 16.
Russia became the first Chinese oil 

112
00:07:01,081 --> 00:07:01,914
supplier with oil that arrives by lands.
This is something incredibly important 

113
00:07:04,981 --> 00:07:05,814
for China because in the case of the 
conflict and the US would be unable to 

114
00:07:08,371 --> 00:07:11,400
block the island writing something it 
could do if that's all it is,

115
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:16,401
arriving by sea.
Both countries have started to conduct a

116
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:25,664
joint military exercises.
They've also created economic and 

117
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:29,024
technological bonds end up agreeing to 
carry out projects to build 

118
00:07:31,341 --> 00:07:34,070
infrastructure which will connect both 
countries.

119
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,280
So how about some examples of this?
Well,

120
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:38,510
let's have a look at the military 
exercises.

121
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:39,513
Yes.

122
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:44,560
Russia and China.
Have you gone eight days of naval drills

123
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:45,700
in the South China Sea

124
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:47,060
seconds,
those economic

125
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,053
bombs

126
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:57,660
infrastructure for this one,
what better example than this?

127
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,703
After 20 years of talks,
construction has finally started on a 

128
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:03,080
bridge between China and

129
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,103
Russia

130
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:09,553
is more.
These two countries have signed 

131
00:08:11,031 --> 00:08:11,864
important military agreements,
kind of has committed to spending 

132
00:08:14,301 --> 00:08:15,134
billions of dollars to buy it.
Some of the most modern equipment that 

133
00:08:17,421 --> 00:08:21,320
the Russian army has,
such as the s 400 surface to air missile

134
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,203
ends,
the most impressive weapon in the 

135
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:26,360
rationale.
The sequoia at 35 fighter aircraft,

136
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:28,400
just to have a look at this incredible

137
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:36,020
today.

138
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:40,860
There are also many economic political 
men's monetary agreements.

139
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:44,460
All of this has led to quite a lot of 
concern in the United States.

140
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,060
Tiny Russian author just

141
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:52,893
sit there for just a second before you 
start to get scared because everything 

142
00:08:55,921 --> 00:08:59,550
isn't quite as ideal as it sounds.
Both powers may have come together,

143
00:08:59,551 --> 00:09:02,560
but there are still many elements that 
separate them.

144
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,590
More mites potentially weaken this 
unity.

145
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:05,453
For One,
China wants to be important and 

146
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,680
influential in international politics 
and that's employees becoming the leader

147
00:09:10,681 --> 00:09:11,514
of Central Asia.
This is something that Russia certainly 

148
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:14,940
doesn't want.
In their view,

149
00:09:14,941 --> 00:09:19,260
the ex Soviet states in the region have 
to remain under the influence of Moscow.

150
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:20,143
Further,
there are issues concerning their 

151
00:09:21,131 --> 00:09:21,964
economic relations.
The trade is unbalanced in favor of 

152
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,224
Russia.
Russia has become a supplier of natural 

153
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:28,500
resources to train.
For the last few years,

154
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:32,400
China has been supplying Russia with 
Chinese manufactured goods,

155
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,263
which are more valuable.
You see China's position towards 

156
00:09:35,041 --> 00:09:35,874
international trade is very pragmatic.
Chinese people want to make money so 

157
00:09:39,061 --> 00:09:42,120
they know it's good for them to open 
their markets to the world.

158
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,660
This is simply an idea that Russia 
doesn't,

159
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:50,660
and then there was the issue with some 
of Russia's partners like India.

160
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,523
Russia is the largest weapons supplier 
in India and and obviously Beijing 

161
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,030
doesn't like that at all,

162
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,913
so even though these two countries are 
trying to get closer and all supporting 

163
00:10:02,011 --> 00:10:02,844
each other against the US,
we shouldn't expect a very solid 

164
00:10:05,461 --> 00:10:09,030
relationship between them after world.
China is eventually going to make a play

165
00:10:09,031 --> 00:10:09,864
to become the leader in this 
relationship and to Russia isn't just 

166
00:10:12,061 --> 00:10:17,061
going to lie down and accept that one.
So you'd be honest.

167
00:10:20,311 --> 00:10:24,120
It doesn't seem very likely that 
reenacting Nixon's strategy is possible.

168
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:28,440
This is largely because China is going 
to strongly oppose this relationship,

169
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:29,303
but despite this,
if trump wants to earn the trust of 

170
00:10:30,691 --> 00:10:31,524
Moscow,
he will have to make some concessions 

171
00:10:32,941 --> 00:10:34,980
which would be difficult to accept in 
Washington.

172
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:38,020
Okay.

173
00:10:38,250 --> 00:10:41,370
Elimination of sanctions given you an on
the Ukraine and Syria,

174
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:43,740
the end of the anti missile shield among
others.

175
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:48,110
Susan is very demanding and even if a 
good relationship is established between

176
00:10:48,111 --> 00:10:48,944
Russia and the United States,
it is not clear whether this alliance 

177
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:54,440
would be very effective as actually 
stopping China.

178
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:55,333
This is one reason why Obama prefer to 
strategy of surrounding China by 

179
00:10:58,311 --> 00:11:00,440
reaching agreements with the countries,
neighbors,

180
00:11:00,530 --> 00:11:01,460
India,
Vietnam,

181
00:11:01,461 --> 00:11:02,930
Malaysia,
and in this strategy,

182
00:11:02,931 --> 00:11:03,764
the TPP was key.
It was of course because it was one of 

183
00:11:06,261 --> 00:11:07,094
the first things that trump flocks when 
he arrived in the White House or any 

184
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:12,830
time is going to be able to tell where 
the trump strategy is going to work out,

185
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,230
but right now it's not looking very 
promising.

186
00:11:15,260 --> 00:11:17,060
So that's our opinion here.
Visual politic,

187
00:11:17,090 --> 00:11:18,800
and we would love to know what you 
think.

188
00:11:18,801 --> 00:11:22,070
Do you think a Chinese Russian alliance,
there's going to be consolidated against

189
00:11:22,071 --> 00:11:22,904
the USA.
What do you think trump will succeed in 

190
00:11:24,051 --> 00:11:28,280
a nixon like relationship with Moscow?
