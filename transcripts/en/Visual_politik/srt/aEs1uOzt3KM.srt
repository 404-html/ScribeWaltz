1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Ostentatious exaggerated,
colossal big themes that Dubai always 

2
00:00:03,571 --> 00:00:05,420
aspires to carry out,
the largest,

3
00:00:05,470 --> 00:00:09,210
most luxurious and most eccentric 
projects in the world.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:18,270
Small territory we can find the tallest 
building,

5
00:00:18,271 --> 00:00:19,104
the most luxurious hotel hands.
Even the largest international airport 

6
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:23,033
on the planet's located in a strategic 
enclave at the mouth of the Persian 

7
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:26,963
Gulf.
The growth process of Dubai is one of 

8
00:00:28,081 --> 00:00:31,020
the fastest in human history.
It just over 20 years.

9
00:00:31,021 --> 00:00:34,890
It has gone from being a remote and last
enclave in the desert to becoming one of

10
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:37,350
the world's great capitals.
In this period of time,

11
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,810
the Emirates of Dubai has multiplied by 
four.

12
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:40,644
It's population by nine,
the number of visitors and buying eight 

13
00:00:43,230 --> 00:00:48,230
the size of its economy.
You said that.

14
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,520
The question is how has all of this 
development been achieved?

15
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:54,230
Has it all just been a matter of oil?
Well,

16
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:57,560
in this visual politic video,
we're going to talk all about Dubai.

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:06,643
Do you believe is one of the seven 
emirates that make up the United Arab 

18
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:10,843
Emirates?
We could describe it as governments as 

19
00:01:11,661 --> 00:01:16,010
an Islamic autocracy that restricts the 
launch part of people's civil liberties.

20
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:16,873
However,
if we compare it with neighboring 

21
00:01:17,991 --> 00:01:19,130
countries,
do Boeing,

22
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,100
is volume follow the most open place in 
the Middle East East?

23
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,240
How about some examples?
Well,

24
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:30,840
here women can drive.
The van is not mandatory.

25
00:01:30,870 --> 00:01:34,780
You can buy pork at the supermarket and 
even alcohol is not hard to come.

26
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:40,160
Yes,

27
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,160
things are starting to change in a way.
I think we could refer to this city as a

28
00:01:44,161 --> 00:01:47,960
kind of oasis in the middle of the 
desert and as you can imagine,

29
00:01:47,961 --> 00:01:51,950
all of this change has had its rewards 
and well these rewards,

30
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,813
they might just surprise you.
Did you know that to Bonnie is already 

31
00:01:55,191 --> 00:01:56,024
the fourth most visited city in the 
world when it comes to international 

32
00:01:58,641 --> 00:01:59,474
visitors and that it surpasses 
epicenters of tourism and as global 

33
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:04,550
trade such as New York,
Hong Kong or Singapore?

34
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,180
It absolutely is and this is something 
that does surprise a lot of people.

35
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:13,970
Of course,
there's one thing we have to be clear on

36
00:02:13,971 --> 00:02:14,610
here,
do buy.

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,180
It does not aspire to be the freest 
place on earth,

38
00:02:17,181 --> 00:02:22,181
but they do want to become the richest 
was of opulence in this place.

39
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:27,043
Also evidence that it's not strange to 
see the Dubai police patrolling the 

40
00:02:30,091 --> 00:02:32,190
streets in Ferrari's on Lamborghini.

41
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:35,930
Where else

42
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:38,960
in the world could you possibly see 
something like this,

43
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:40,610
so you might at this moment would be 
thinking,

44
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,473
well,
there's an easy explanation for all of 

45
00:02:42,951 --> 00:02:45,170
this,
and that is of course oil.

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,033
Now,
could it be that Dubai is nothing more 

47
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:50,510
than a dream method is financed with 
petro dollars?

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,880
Well,
although we cannot deny the influence of

49
00:02:52,881 --> 00:02:53,714
black goals here,
the truth is that the real key to 

50
00:02:55,880 --> 00:03:00,190
success is very different.
The secret to Dubai is not oil,

51
00:03:00,250 --> 00:03:03,280
but rather its commitment to trade.
Don't believe me.

52
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:05,560
Well,
let's dive in a little deeper.

53
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,400
Yeah,

54
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,470
enough oil.
The ends of the 19 fifties,

55
00:03:15,581 --> 00:03:19,270
important oil deposits were discovered 
in the vicinity of Abu Dhabi.

56
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:20,520
The capital of the Emirates.

57
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:26,240
Take note it because we're not talking 
about some small discovery,

58
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:30,110
but an absolutely huge amounts of oil.
To give you an idea,

59
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,150
it is estimated that the wealth of the 
Emirates,

60
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,200
they're proven reserves is even greater 
than all the reserves in Russia.

61
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,990
However,
in the case of Dubai,

62
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:38,863
things that were a little bit different,
it is true that this territory was also 

63
00:03:41,781 --> 00:03:42,614
graced with the 14 of black goals,
but it's authorities soon realize that 

64
00:03:45,831 --> 00:03:50,360
their reserves were much smaller than 
those of their compatriots in Abu Dhabi.

65
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,083
In fact,
the only surprise us oil today accounts 

66
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:59,570
for less than one in every $100 produced
by Dubai's economy.

67
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:01,700
So you've probably heard about how 
important it is.

68
00:04:01,701 --> 00:04:03,740
Do you diversify it and economy rice?
Well,

69
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:08,240
that is precisely what Dubai did.
They overcame their dependence and their

70
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,680
addiction to wild.
Now,

71
00:04:09,681 --> 00:04:12,080
this is all very easy to say,
but the question is,

72
00:04:12,081 --> 00:04:13,550
well,
how did they do it?

73
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,443
What did you do to achieve such 
developments can achieve a higher 

74
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:20,830
standard of living even compared to its 
oil rich natives.

75
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:25,683
Well,
basically what it did was attract a 

76
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:27,484
whole bunch of multinationals and 
professionals from all around the world 

77
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,443
to achieve this.
The first thing they did was only low 

78
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,790
tax policy in Dubai.
They have no income tax.

79
00:04:36,820 --> 00:04:37,653
The tax on profits,
it's practically nonexistent 

80
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,300
concurrently.
Purchases and not taxed either or the.

81
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:43,143
The latter is about to change as the 
result of a joint agreement between all 

82
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:47,920
members of the Persian Gulf Cooperation 
Council.

83
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:50,650
Tax on purchases will soon be launched,
however,

84
00:04:50,651 --> 00:04:52,270
the rate is only going to be about five 
percent,

85
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:53,104
which is significantly lower than the 
rates we see in developed countries 

86
00:04:55,331 --> 00:04:57,070
which tend to be around 18 percent.

87
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,290
Of course in case you were wondering in 
Dubai that are no taxes on gasoline.

88
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:08,213
Yes,
I know it almost seems like we're 

89
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,350
talking about another planet,
rice,

90
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:15,120
but do not think that low taxes are the 
only strategy that Dubai has follows not

91
00:05:15,121 --> 00:05:15,954
at all in fact,
seconds and perhaps even more important 

92
00:05:17,791 --> 00:05:20,280
than taxes.
You buying his resorted to an instrument

93
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:23,490
known as a special economic zones like 
here,

94
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,353
they are somewhat different to the ones 
we can find elsewhere in the wells and 

95
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:30,300
do these special areas in addition to 
having tax benefits,

96
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,210
even have their own regulations almost 
lost,

97
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:37,200
which as you can imagine,
are always focused on promoting business

98
00:05:37,201 --> 00:05:39,870
activity precisely thanks to you having 
specific rules.

99
00:05:39,871 --> 00:05:40,704
Companies can escape the rigidity of 
legal systems that are inspired by 

100
00:05:44,371 --> 00:05:47,040
Sharia law applies.
Of course,

101
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:48,210
to the rest of the Emirates,

102
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:52,993
we can find a good example of this model
in these so called Dubai international 

103
00:05:56,691 --> 00:05:57,524
financial,
which is almost a states within another 

104
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:01,910
state look,
this financial center,

105
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:04,400
it even has its own judicial system,
Chad,

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,293
by the way,
by a British judge and it even has its 

107
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
own official language which is not 
Arabic but English and it's also 

108
00:06:11,121 --> 00:06:13,730
replaced the local currency with the US 
dollar.

109
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,590
In this way,
a financial institution.

110
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,700
The bank,
for example,

111
00:06:16,701 --> 00:06:19,160
can do business as if it was in 
Manhattan,

112
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:22,590
are benefiting from the tax advantages 
of Dubai.

113
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,460
A lot of our deals

114
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,293
right?

115
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,970
Well now we can probably understand how 
Dubai has managed to attract most of the

116
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:31,833
25 largest banks in the world,
but this is not all along with the low 

117
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:36,274
taxes and special economic zones.
Dubai has also opted for a very high 

118
00:06:39,521 --> 00:06:42,280
degree of immigration freedom and the 
result of all this,

119
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,980
well,
96 percent of its inhabitants,

120
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:50,040
they've been born a boy.
Wait a second,

121
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:53,850
because there is still more now to 
further boost foreign investments.

122
00:06:53,851 --> 00:06:54,684
At the beginning of this century,
the Dubai authorities made an 

123
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:59,670
unprecedented decision for this corner 
of the world,

124
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:05,193
right?

125
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,033
Being bold.
Governments of Dubai approved a risky 

126
00:07:11,761 --> 00:07:14,790
decree that's announced any foreigner 
regardless of their religion,

127
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:17,580
to make real estate investments at that 
moment,

128
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,920
the authentic,
but it really began.

129
00:07:25,250 --> 00:07:27,440
I was full of buildings and large 
projects,

130
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:29,960
hundreds of skyscrapers,
gigantic shopping centers,

131
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:31,033
even it's famous artificial islands.
Now the demand for Dubai became 

132
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:35,233
absolutely global.
It's the fact that since 2002 Dubai has 

133
00:07:38,061 --> 00:07:42,530
experienced real estate developments 
comparable only to that of Shanghai City

134
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:44,090
with 13 times more

135
00:07:48,370 --> 00:07:49,020
indeed,

136
00:07:49,020 --> 00:07:49,853
one of the most surprising things about 
Dubai is that it has a population of 

137
00:07:52,451 --> 00:07:55,210
less than 3 million inhabitants just 
like this,

138
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:57,490
where before there were only a handful 
of skyscrapers.

139
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:58,324
Thanks to this decree that are now 
hundreds and huge projects are 

140
00:08:01,091 --> 00:08:02,830
announced,
one after the other.

141
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,210
B,
this new skyscrapers,

142
00:08:04,270 --> 00:08:05,890
ferris wheels,
theme parks,

143
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,570
whatever.
One of these latest projects,

144
00:08:07,571 --> 00:08:09,820
by the way,
is known as the mall of the wealth.

145
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:13,890
It's a gigantic space designed to become
the largest shopping center in the world

146
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:14,743
hands,
which will even has its own cultural 

147
00:08:15,971 --> 00:08:18,190
districts with dozens of theaters and 
cinemas.

148
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,083
100 hotels,
the largest indoor theme park in the 

149
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:22,594
world.
The project has been presented as the 

150
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:27,130
world's first city with a temperature 
controlled environment.

151
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:38,230
All

152
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,063
of these measures have made Dubai a 
place where it is easy to do business 

153
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,230
until he turns.
This mrs into a commercial,

154
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,450
touristic financial,
logistical,

155
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:48,700
and Steven industrial power.
Yes.

156
00:08:48,701 --> 00:08:53,140
Anyone who thinks that all Dubai,
Isabel is banks and hotels is very,

157
00:08:53,141 --> 00:08:56,700
very wrong nowadays.
Dubai largely thanks to its modern ports

158
00:08:56,701 --> 00:09:00,800
and special zones is the third largest 
exporting power in the world ends.

159
00:09:00,801 --> 00:09:04,260
It's industrial production exceeds 
$50,000,000,000.

160
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:05,243
Every single.

161
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,183
Yeah.

162
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:14,760
Is what explains why its neighbors are 
on easily watching any fall in the price

163
00:09:14,761 --> 00:09:15,594
of oil.
While the government of Dubai continues 

164
00:09:17,101 --> 00:09:17,934
to carry out and large projects.
It is true from a strictly political 

165
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,354
points of view that there aren't many 
reprehensible elements when it comes to 

166
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,100
religious,
social or human rights issues.

167
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:28,500
For example,
that all the painful conditions suffered

168
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:31,230
by many construction workers from 
countries such as India,

169
00:09:31,231 --> 00:09:32,610
Bangladesh,
or Pakistan.

170
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,710
Now,
of course we cannot ignore this reality,

171
00:09:34,711 --> 00:09:35,544
but we cannot not pay attention to the 
achievements of this emeris among other 

172
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,200
things,
because of this growth,

173
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:41,034
divine has managed to influence the 
policies of its neighbors and they are 

174
00:09:43,681 --> 00:09:45,990
beginning to reduce their dependence on 
oil as well.

175
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:47,930
Dubai is quite simply a great model.

176
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:51,930
Consider it,

177
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,353
for example,
the new Saudi Arabia onto Mohammed bin 

178
00:09:55,460 --> 00:09:56,293
Salman.
This is something we actually spoke 

179
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,760
about in a previous video.
Anyway,

180
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:01,730
I think this case puts a very important 
question on the table.

181
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:02,593
Is it possible to reconcile the absence 
of civil rights with sustainable 

182
00:10:06,021 --> 00:10:07,460
economic growth?
Overtime?

183
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:11,930
No history and empirical evidence seems 
to show that this is not the case,

184
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,823
but in a world increasingly pressured by
very high taxes and regulations of all 

185
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,054
kinds,
Dubai's authorities seem intent on 

186
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:22,410
demonstrating that this time it will be 
possible at the moment.

187
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:23,263
Spitz commitment to free trade and 
investments and its policies aimed at 

188
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,850
strengthening legal security,
ease of doing business and keeping taxes

189
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:30,740
low have been supportive.
If anything,

190
00:10:30,741 --> 00:10:31,574
do you buy shoes?
It's the competitiveness and trade tend 

191
00:10:33,051 --> 00:10:33,884
to have better results in terms of 
developments than protectionism or 

192
00:10:36,321 --> 00:10:37,154
subsidies.
Many rules should pay attention to the 

193
00:10:38,931 --> 00:10:42,420
successes of this oasis in the desert,
but that's our opinion here,

194
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,273
visual politic,
and now we'd love to know what you 

195
00:10:44,451 --> 00:10:45,284
think.
Do you think the divine model will make 

196
00:10:46,341 --> 00:10:48,140
the Middle East a freer place?
Well,
