1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,530
Here's the question sheet and Google the
answer.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,730
Imagine that you have to buy a house.
Where would be cheaper?

3
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,623
Barcelona or Miami if you need a clear.
Let me tell you that both cities have 

4
00:00:18,471 --> 00:00:21,890
more or less the same population.
If we consider the metropolitan area,

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:24,650
both cities have beaches and to very 
touristy.

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:28,813
In addition,
the average salary in Miami is almost 

7
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:34,640
twice the one in Barcelona and the 
unemployment rate is much,

8
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:37,010
much lower.
Having said all of that many,

9
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,030
many things that my logic Barcelona 
would be cheaper than Miami.

10
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:41,923
Well,
if you're thinking that you're actually 

11
00:00:43,461 --> 00:00:44,294
wrong,
heightens in Miami are 15 percent 

12
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:46,634
cheaper than those in Barcelona.
If you were buying a house in Spain is 

13
00:00:50,571 --> 00:00:51,404
truly an impossible mission,
but I know what you may be thinking 

14
00:00:53,121 --> 00:00:54,350
right now.
Houses.

15
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:56,300
Well,
they're expensive everywhere,

16
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:57,590
right?
Well,

17
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,120
yeah,
you are actually right.

18
00:00:59,121 --> 00:00:59,954
House prices are rising in almost every 
country and this is especially 

19
00:01:02,691 --> 00:01:06,340
surprising if we consider that the trend
is quite the opposite for other good.

20
00:01:10,010 --> 00:01:12,230
We've said it already on this channel 
like a thousand times.

21
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:13,064
Humanity is just doing better.
We've practically eradicated 

22
00:01:15,861 --> 00:01:16,694
malnutrition old around the world.
Our standard of living is much higher 

23
00:01:19,551 --> 00:01:20,384
than that of our grandparents and this 
is pretty much do among other things to 

24
00:01:23,811 --> 00:01:26,750
the fact that the products we consume,
they're getting cheaper.

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:29,150
For instance,
just 30 years ago,

26
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,013
our parents would have to save an 
average month salary to fly from London 

27
00:01:33,380 --> 00:01:37,960
to Berlin.
Nowadays,

28
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:40,900
that's just history.
That's housing is the only elements that

29
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:43,430
hasn't become more accessible.
Indeed.

30
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:47,110
It's becoming almost prohibitively 
expensive in many parts of the world.

31
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,120
In this video,
we're going to focus on Spain,

32
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:50,063
but many of the things we're going to 
review because happen in almost any 

33
00:01:53,410 --> 00:01:54,243
country because the question that we're 
asking ourselves today is why is it so 

34
00:01:57,791 --> 00:02:01,630
damn expensive to buy a house and can we
do anything to solve this?

35
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,613
Well,
we are going to answer these questions 

36
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,980
today,
but first let's dive into the history

37
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,783
law of the land.
Once the first and most important thing 

38
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:14,270
we need to build a house,
well,

39
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:17,210
that would of course be the lambs that 
were going to build it on rice.

40
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:18,620
Well,
in that aspect,

41
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:22,470
Spain has the perfect geography.
We're talking about a huge,

42
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:26,330
relatively flat country with many 
unpopulated areas.

43
00:02:26,420 --> 00:02:27,740
Are the countries,
for example,

44
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:28,574
the Netherlands,
do you have the very real problem that 

45
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,590
they high population density?
However,

46
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:36,830
Spain has plenty of space for all of its
inhabitants.

47
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:40,930
No.
Having a

48
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,260
piece of land doesn't necessarily mean 
we can use it to build houses.

49
00:02:44,410 --> 00:02:45,243
For example,
in 2011 40 percent of the land in the 

50
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:50,500
capital,
Madrid was considered not urbanized.

51
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,420
This means that the city council limits 
construction in these territories.

52
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,463
In other cities such as Malaga,
this percentage even rises to more than 

53
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:00,310
70

54
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,870
percent.
You might be wondering,

55
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:04,420
well,
why all of a sudden many lands where you

56
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:09,100
can't build up the onset of this lies in
municipal services.

57
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:11,710
You see when you build in a residential 
area,

58
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:13,360
you need sewers,
electricity,

59
00:03:13,361 --> 00:03:14,194
new bus lines,
and of course things like garbage 

60
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:17,500
collection and say,
well,

61
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:19,480
who's responsible for all of these 
costs?

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,540
The city councils,
that is every.

63
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:23,813
Okay.

64
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,603
If a construction company proposes a 
housing development on the outskirts of 

65
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:32,890
Madrid,
it doesn't manage to sell them all.

66
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,430
Every local will have to pay for a ghost
areas.

67
00:03:36,460 --> 00:03:37,390
Urban services

68
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:38,423
due to all of this town councils have 
decided to control every single detail 

69
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:45,450
of where and how that municipality you 
can extend in Spain.

70
00:03:45,451 --> 00:03:49,500
This is done through a legal instruments
known as the urban ordination plans.

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,393
These are maps that every city will 
publishes every 10 years specifying the 

72
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:56,790
areas in which someone can build,
because hold on a second,

73
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:59,250
maybe you're Spanish and you're watching
this video from Spain.

74
00:03:59,251 --> 00:04:03,330
Now I know what you might be thinking.
Isn't land supposed to be liberalized in

75
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:08,331
Spain in 1997,
Jose,

76
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:09,514
Maria,
as Sonos governments put out a law 

77
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:13,990
that's involved in theory land 
liberalization.

78
00:04:14,050 --> 00:04:18,880
This means that in theory all of the 
countries lands became developable.

79
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:21,880
That is essentially it is suitable for 
construction.

80
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:26,440
Suddenly every Spanish city group and 
lots of residential areas emerged.

81
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:29,920
This was the beginning of the housing 
bubble butts.

82
00:04:30,010 --> 00:04:35,010
As we've mentioned many times the devil 
in the details take.

83
00:04:37,950 --> 00:04:38,783
Now,
we said that the urban ordination plans 

84
00:04:40,021 --> 00:04:44,440
determine the areas one can build on,
but that's not the entire picture hat.

85
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:47,100
It also sets the conditions for 
building.

86
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,083
Okay,
imagine we're requesting a permit from 

87
00:04:49,681 --> 00:04:54,030
the Barcelona City Council to build a 
block of flats on a plot that we own.

88
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,923
Well,
the city council will say absolutely no 

89
00:04:56,191 --> 00:04:59,790
problem,
but you can only build 20 homes or 15 or

90
00:04:59,791 --> 00:05:00,390
maybe even just

91
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,223
10.

92
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:05,950
They need to see the problem.
Even if construction is allowed,

93
00:05:05,951 --> 00:05:08,140
housing supply is still highly

94
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,073
restricted and by the way,
this also explains many of Spain's 

95
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,393
corruption cases.
Most of the scandals that have been 

96
00:05:15,171 --> 00:05:18,380
discovered in recent years were revealed
because developer,

97
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,214
it was bing a town planning a council so
that instead of getting a permit for 10 

98
00:05:23,151 --> 00:05:25,700
houses,
they'd get one for twice as many.

99
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,310
In other words,
the construction sector has a larger and

100
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:30,173
more perverse incentive to essentially 
invest in bribes than any other sex at 

101
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:39,050
like for example,
incurred in the 20th century.

102
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,630
Can you guess the least productive 
sector of the economy,

103
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,960
as you might imagine it is indeed 
construction.

104
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:53,300
We're talking about a world where it's 
all just.

105
00:05:53,301 --> 00:05:56,090
You find a project actually being built 
by its due date,

106
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:59,870
and this isn't just limited to Spain.
They give you an idea.

107
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,640
The new apple offices in Silicon Valley,
they were completed two years later than

108
00:06:04,641 --> 00:06:09,641
expected and has an extra cost of 
$2,000,000,000 and the same happens with

109
00:06:10,131 --> 00:06:12,030
almost every house built,

110
00:06:12,130 --> 00:06:12,963
right?

111
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,713
One survey of British architects found 
that 60 percent of their buildings were 

112
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:19,870
late

113
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,850
and so well.
Now you might be wondering,

114
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:25,630
well pointed these things out,
but as whole the answer essentially lies

115
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,820
in a lack of innovation.
Of course,

116
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,743
houses today a much more modern.
They have better insulation that a 

117
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:32,374
heating systems,
but the way in which they're built is 

118
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,300
pretty much the same as it was 50 years 
ago.

119
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:40,630
Any economic sector,
it's just much more advanced.

120
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:42,850
For example,
a car factory 60 years ago,

121
00:06:42,940 --> 00:06:45,340
it looks nothing like a car factory 
today.

122
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,040
Most of the jobs,
our grandparents health have simply been

123
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:51,730
replaced by computer programs,
machines and robots.

124
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,200
What's the results of this?
Well,

125
00:06:53,230 --> 00:06:54,063
nowadays a call has many more features 
and is cheaper to make than it was 60 

126
00:06:57,491 --> 00:06:58,810
years ago.
Thanks to that.

127
00:06:58,840 --> 00:07:01,930
Now almost every family can afford one 
or even two.

128
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,613
However,
if we saw a construction project from 

129
00:07:07,971 --> 00:07:12,710
the 19 sixties with barely notice any 
difference with one done today at all,

130
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:14,500
same builders,
same grains,

131
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,990
I mean construction companies have 
barely invested at all in innovation and

132
00:07:17,991 --> 00:07:19,400
it's understandable.
If we take,

133
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,250
they're extremely low profit margins 
into accounts.

134
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:22,880
You

135
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,020
heard that,
right?

136
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:29,660
Housing developer can expect a profit 
margin of two to five percent.

137
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,523
Of course,
if we're talking about millions of 

138
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,384
euros,
two percent is more than enough to make 

139
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,390
the company's owner rich.

140
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:40,060
You gotta hit that,
Ya know,

141
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:49,450
barely allows them to reinvest in other 
things such as research and development.

142
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:53,140
And if this weren't enough,
there are very few incentives to replace

143
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,220
workers in machines

144
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:58,400
and if this was not enough,
there are very few incentives to replace

145
00:07:58,401 --> 00:08:01,220
workers with machines here.
Unlike other economic sectors,

146
00:08:01,221 --> 00:08:04,540
working in construction requires initial
training as well.

147
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,790
This leads to a greater concentration of
low skills.

148
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:13,813
We can summarize everything like this.
There's a restricted land supply which 

149
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:18,314
makes property prices rise,
and then there's a long and expensive 

150
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,800
and unpredictable construction process.
Now,

151
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,693
what's the result of all of this?
Both homes in Spain have become 

152
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:30,050
prohibitively expensive.
However,

153
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:33,260
almost 80 percent of Spaniards,
they've managed to own their own home.

154
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,390
So the question is now,
well,

155
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:37,370
how is this possible?
Well,

156
00:08:37,371 --> 00:08:42,371
let's dive into that money for everyone.
That's a basic principle in economics.

157
00:08:46,351 --> 00:08:49,680
Things all worth what someone is willing
to pay for them.

158
00:08:49,710 --> 00:08:50,543
For example,
if a foreign flat in a normal 

159
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:54,900
neighborhood of Madrid is worth more 
than 300,000 years,

160
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:58,410
it's because someone can afford to pay 
more than 300,000 euros.

161
00:08:58,550 --> 00:09:02,790
That how can there be so many people who
can pay so much?

162
00:09:02,791 --> 00:09:03,624
I mean,
isn't Spain's supposed to be in a 

163
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:07,290
financial crisis?
Didn't we say that the average salary in

164
00:09:07,291 --> 00:09:09,900
Spain is less than 2000 euros a month?

165
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,450
Okay,

166
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,790
well,
dear viewer,

167
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:15,933
the answer lies of course in the banks,
300,000 euros is a true fortune for 

168
00:09:21,431 --> 00:09:23,530
someone earning an average salary.
Bart,

169
00:09:23,531 --> 00:09:27,430
if one pays all that money in 
comfortable installments over many,

170
00:09:27,431 --> 00:09:29,980
many years,
it'd be a bit easier.

171
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,010
And so how many years do you think we're
talking about here?

172
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,220
Ten years.
Twenty years?

173
00:09:33,340 --> 00:09:34,173
Well,
the truth is that we're talking about a 

174
00:09:36,041 --> 00:09:37,660
lot,
lot longer,

175
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:45,000
40 year mortgages in exclusive and 
conditional product for young people.

176
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:45,953
Forty years is an incredible amounts of 
time and it's really not uncommon in 

177
00:09:48,631 --> 00:09:49,464
Spain to find people.
You have these 40 year mortgages and 

178
00:09:52,230 --> 00:09:55,260
some may say to all of this,
what's really the sense in that?

179
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,430
Imagine you're a bank and you grounds a 
couple,

180
00:09:57,450 --> 00:09:58,283
a 40 year loan,
a thousand different things can happen 

181
00:10:00,541 --> 00:10:01,374
in four decades,
which means they might not be able to 

182
00:10:02,890 --> 00:10:03,723
return the money.
So where's the business for the bank 

183
00:10:05,521 --> 00:10:06,354
here?
How can the bank risk so much when 

184
00:10:08,431 --> 00:10:09,480
grunting alone?
Oh,

185
00:10:09,870 --> 00:10:12,420
well,
the answer to that is in the central

186
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:15,610
thank you.

187
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:20,970
Be to keep printing billions of euros to
prop up the eurozone until 2019.

188
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,750
You really did hear that Rice.
Nowadays,

189
00:10:23,751 --> 00:10:25,670
Europe is producing more money

190
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,760
than ever.
However,

191
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:29,610
Europe does have a relatively low 
inflation.

192
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,473
Great.

193
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,453
In another visual politic video,
we did explain that when central banks 

194
00:10:36,801 --> 00:10:39,140
print bills prices,
they tend to go up.

195
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:42,380
However,
in Europe the opposite happens so well,

196
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:43,400
why is this?
Well,

197
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,234
that's because all of that newly printed
money that goes directly to the banks 

198
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:50,450
and the banks he was at for.
Well,

199
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:51,640
of course that was the loan.

200
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,030
That explains why even with relatively 
low salaries,

201
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:03,070
most Spaniards are willing to pay real 
fortunes to own a house and what's worse

202
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:03,933
prices continue to rise unabated.
It will always be someone willing to 

203
00:11:07,571 --> 00:11:10,270
originate or take out a 40 year 
mortgage.

204
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:11,223
In other words,
all the factors point to the fact that 

205
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:13,494
this in the long term housing will 
become more and more expensive and that 

206
00:11:16,451 --> 00:11:18,790
explains things like this.

207
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,920
Housing profitability

208
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:23,680
rises as an investment.

209
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,320
This means that along with the people 
who buy an apartment to live in is there

210
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:29,154
are people who buy them as an 
investments and other words central 

211
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:32,604
banks inflate to hens.
Municipalities restrict supply 

212
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:40,790
conclusion of all of this.
Houses are becoming more expensive every

213
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:41,633
single day and at this point I just want
to take the time to thank Miguel and 

214
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,854
health on seconds,
architectural studies for helping us 

215
00:11:45,181 --> 00:11:46,014
understand all the details of the world 
of construction in and planning in 

216
00:11:48,571 --> 00:11:49,404
Spain.
Gal and how Fonseca is one of the 

217
00:11:50,941 --> 00:11:53,560
greatest experts of sustainable 
architecture in Spain.

218
00:11:53,561 --> 00:11:57,100
You can find more details about him in 
the video description below

219
00:12:01,610 --> 00:12:02,443
and well now it's time to turn to you.
How do you think this problem should be 

220
00:12:06,381 --> 00:12:07,214
solved?
Do you think we should restrict bank 

221
00:12:08,301 --> 00:12:10,490
mortgages?
What about released the land in order to

222
00:12:10,491 --> 00:12:14,000
be able to build more?
What kind of policies do you think would

223
00:12:14,001 --> 00:12:14,990
solve this problem?
Well,

224
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:17,480
please leave your answers in the
