1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,553
Would you used to be considered the 
safest country in South America and at 

2
00:00:11,461 --> 00:00:13,500
the same time,
the second poorest,

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,600
but now it seems like things have 
changing.

4
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:16,573
You see,
Nicaragua is a country full of 

5
00:00:18,061 --> 00:00:18,894
contradictions.
It's President Daniel Ortega likes to 

6
00:00:20,671 --> 00:00:24,620
brag about his deep Marxist Leninist 
reaps man's.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:28,370
Yet he defines himself as a Catholic and
just even banned abortion in

8
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:32,830
country.
Nonetheless,

9
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,723
spine.
That facade of moral rectitude doesn't 

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:38,960
man facing an open trial for abusing his
stepdaughter.

11
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:42,570
Displaying this Daniel Tiger's known as 
a big time family man.

12
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,413
In fact,
you know the Nicaraguan vice president 

13
00:00:45,081 --> 00:00:45,950
is.
Well,

14
00:00:45,951 --> 00:00:50,951
that would be as wife Rae Sarria Maria.
Yeah.

15
00:00:52,201 --> 00:00:55,350
Right now you're thinking Ms Dot Ortega.
Probably not the kind of guy you want to

16
00:00:55,351 --> 00:00:56,310
have as a president.
Rice.

17
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,860
Well,
before you start judging too harshly.

18
00:00:59,100 --> 00:00:59,933
Here's the other side of that coin.
He's been in power since 2007 with a 

19
00:01:04,231 --> 00:01:09,231
popular support rating.
Higher than sixty cents and even we have

20
00:01:09,511 --> 00:01:12,000
to admit,
but when it comes to foreign relations,

21
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,060
he's a genius.
Are You A.

22
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:21,070
is one of the few countries that has 
ties with Iran,

23
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,540
Russia,
Venezuela.

24
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:25,150
At the same time,
the United States of America,

25
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,650
yes,
you heard that rise.

26
00:01:26,651 --> 00:01:28,870
Many of his comrades in the Sandinista 
Front,

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,733
his political party accused him of 
selling his soul to capitalism and that 

28
00:01:33,191 --> 00:01:36,730
only entirely wrong here or there in 
Nicaragua is a poor country.

29
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:37,653
It's also one of the most stable 
economies in the region with an average 

30
00:01:40,871 --> 00:01:44,050
GDP growth rates of four point six 
percent.

31
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,033
The population living below the poverty 
line is getting smaller and smaller 

32
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:48,813
year.

33
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,683
Yeah,

34
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:53,263
well,
just look at the immigration statistics 

35
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:59,600
and you'll see an exodus of Guatemalans 
and Mexicans moving to the USA.

36
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,830
The Nicaraguans citizens seem to be 
comfortable staying in the home country.

37
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:05,420
Apparently that satisfied

38
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:09,350
fight with the political situation,
or at least they used to be.

39
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:11,690
The final straw came with pension 
reform.

40
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:14,510
The government has reduced the amount of
money that tired people get,

41
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:18,530
and at the same time has increased what 
workers have to pay into the system.

42
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:21,200
As you can imagine,
nobody liked this policy.

43
00:02:21,380 --> 00:02:22,780
Now that the businessmen,
northern workers,

44
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,603
and this is how the biggest 
demonstration against Daniel Ortega's 

45
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:30,663
machine started,
they've tried to oppress these protests 

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,850
with police brutality and massive and 
prison.

47
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:37,210
Since many people have already lost 
their lives,

48
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:40,720
even the government has said or owned 
sympathizers to confront the protesters.

49
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:41,933
So far,
none of these messages have stopped the 

50
00:02:43,681 --> 00:02:46,710
demonstrations.
So now the question becomes,

51
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:47,723
why is all of this happening now when 
Nicaragua has no economic crisis 

52
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,433
whatsoever?
Are we witnessing the end of Daniel 

53
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,710
Tiger's rule?
Oh,

54
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,300
we about to see the end of the 
Sandinista,

55
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,500
Nicaragua.
Well,

56
00:02:58,501 --> 00:03:00,700
today we aren't going to answer all of 
these questions,

57
00:03:00,701 --> 00:03:05,701
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the history on

58
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:11,920
Disney star.
Yeah,

59
00:03:11,921 --> 00:03:12,754
I know.
The title of this section is going to 

60
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:16,740
ring a bell for many of you.
If you were alive during the 90 days,

61
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:20,470
you might have heard of the Sandinista 
album from the British punk bands.

62
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,560
The clash,
the truth is during the eighties,

63
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:24,453
Nicaragua,
it became a symbol of the struggle 

64
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:27,970
against American imperial.
Yeah,

65
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:31,370
that's fine.

66
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:35,110
Exam,
the Sandinista friends,

67
00:03:35,111 --> 00:03:35,944
it made its way to power off often 
decades of a far right wing 

68
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:39,423
dictatorship.
If I tell you that the Sandinista front 

69
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:45,430
defines itself as a Marxist,
Leninist,

70
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:48,400
anti American political policy,
you won't be surprised,

71
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,234
but here's the funny boss.
They combine all of that ideology with 

72
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:52,923
religion.
Have you ever heard of liberation 

73
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:55,293
theology?
What it was in movement within the 

74
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,903
Catholic Church,
especially among Latin American Roman 

75
00:03:58,901 --> 00:03:59,734
Catholics and his followers were die 
hard supporters of the Sandinista 

76
00:04:03,011 --> 00:04:03,844
comrades there some message of genuine 
Christian anymore than you see on the 

77
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:13,630
screen now.
That is Daniel Ortega.

78
00:04:13,660 --> 00:04:14,493
Back then,
he was already the leader of the 

79
00:04:15,881 --> 00:04:19,060
Sandinista fronts and the presidents of 
Nicaragua,

80
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:22,410
as you can imagine,
in the middle of the Cold War America.

81
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:26,440
I wasn't about to let this country fall 
under communist rule without a fight.

82
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
That's why then American president,
Ronald Reagan organized one of the most 

83
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:32,560
controversial decisions in American 
history.

84
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:35,170
For one,
he sold his weapons to the ISR elders in

85
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:37,450
Iran who were fighting Saddam Hussein's 
Iraq.

86
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:38,313
Of course,
this was a top secret deal because Iran 

87
00:04:39,971 --> 00:04:42,280
was officially an enemy of the United 
States.

88
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,233
After that,
he took all the money from the sales to 

89
00:04:44,861 --> 00:04:47,570
finance the so called Contrera in 
Nicaragua.

90
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:48,483
The concert were a far right wing 
terrorist group that fought against the 

91
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:53,200
governments of Daniel Ortega.

92
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,533
I'm speaking of Nicaraguan,
a Soviet era on the American mainland 

93
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,920
only two hours flying time from our own 
borders or our own security.

94
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:05,970
The United States must deny the Soviet 
Union a beachhead in North America.

95
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,280
As you can imagine,
when the story got leaks,

96
00:05:08,350 --> 00:05:12,640
the media went pretty crazy and so did 
the world of music.

97
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:13,533
That's why we have so many songs and 
records from those times from the clash 

98
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:21,420
to Kris Kristofferson.
Now,

99
00:05:21,430 --> 00:05:22,263
you might be wondering,
what did Daniel Ortega do while he was 

100
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:25,180
empowered?
Will?

101
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,013
In a way,
you could see that he set a precedent 

102
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:28,690
for Nicolas Maduro,
Venezuela.

103
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,733
In short,
the Sandinista government nationalized 

104
00:05:31,481 --> 00:05:35,170
all of the companies that were in the 
hands of the local oligarchs,

105
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,990
and how did they pay for all of that?
Well,

106
00:05:37,991 --> 00:05:38,824
they did that by getting more and more 
loans from the Soviet Union and of 

107
00:05:41,711 --> 00:05:44,110
course printing money like there was no 
tomorrow,

108
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,820
and what was the outcome of all of this?
Well,

109
00:05:45,821 --> 00:05:46,654
in the year 1986 soft,
a little more than five years under our 

110
00:05:49,171 --> 00:05:50,004
tag is rural Nicaragua with suffering 
from one of the worst cases of 

111
00:05:52,931 --> 00:05:57,931
hyperinflation of all time,
the bitterest of the conflict

112
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,933
between the countries.
Former Sunday nice to leaders and 

113
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:04,520
American backed rebels'.
All Nicaraguans shared one crucial piece

114
00:06:04,521 --> 00:06:07,970
of common ground,
the reliance on the American dollar.

115
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,410
Just imagine that the value of the local
currency,

116
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:13,950
the Cordoba would value every 15 days.
This means that if you bought a beer one

117
00:06:13,951 --> 00:06:14,784
day and paid,
say 10 goal date is yet to come back 

118
00:06:16,471 --> 00:06:20,580
four months later,
and the same beer would be over 3000.

119
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:21,533
Now we've told you many times here on 
visual policy that the worst thing that 

120
00:06:24,121 --> 00:06:26,970
can happen to a country is 
hyperinflation.

121
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:32,090
This is why despite the fact that Daniel
Ortega have so much support to citizens,

122
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:33,870
showed him that backs.

123
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:37,540
This is why in the year 1990 Nicaragua 
had a new currency,

124
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:38,433
the Golden Cordoba,
at a different government this time of 

125
00:06:40,531 --> 00:06:41,364
conservative one during the nineties,
Daniel Ortega was the leader of the 

126
00:06:43,691 --> 00:06:45,160
opposition party.
Meanwhile,

127
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,310
the country was getting rid of that 
hyperinflation and it was coming back to

128
00:06:48,311 --> 00:06:50,060
the situation of stable pop.

129
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:53,193
No

130
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:54,083
Nicaraguans kept being poor,
but at least they didn't have big 

131
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:57,324
surprises.
The purchasing power wouldn't diminish 

132
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:02,760
because there's not so much inflation 
and there were no more wars or terrorist

133
00:07:02,761 --> 00:07:03,594
attacks

134
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:09,600
and this is how we get to the year 2006 
the year.

135
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:12,980
When Nicaragua Hell's new elections and 
not civil,

136
00:07:12,981 --> 00:07:13,814
look at what happens

137
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,270
to Ortegas

138
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,333
in 2006,
so we'll take a [inaudible] to the 

139
00:07:22,691 --> 00:07:25,420
governments,
but this time he was a different version

140
00:07:25,421 --> 00:07:26,440
of himself.
Of course,

141
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:28,480
he was still a member of the Sandinista 
fronts,

142
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:33,070
but so many years as the opposition 
helped reshape his ideas,

143
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,183
neil or take a no longer supports 
Marxist Leninism and is now a supporter 

144
00:07:39,851 --> 00:07:42,220
of Ortega.
That is the problem.

145
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:44,200
Testimonial from a Sunday to supporter.

146
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:45,173
Of course,
this brand new version of Daniel Ortega 

147
00:07:46,950 --> 00:07:51,200
still sticks to the same old socialist 
rhetoric is government guarantees,

148
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:54,200
universal access to healthcare and 
education in facts,

149
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:55,034
but if the literacy rates and average 
life expectancy have increased in the 

150
00:07:57,391 --> 00:07:58,224
country,
but that rush for nationalization has 

151
00:08:00,481 --> 00:08:03,150
given way to more moderate discourse,

152
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:08,400
look over there.
Look,

153
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,510
white collar workers,
blue collar workers,

154
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:14,900
farmers,
producers,

155
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,780
entrepreneurs,
small businessmen,

156
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:17,653
and big businessmen,
all the economic and social powers of 

157
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:23,060
the country.
Let's work together.

158
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:24,710
Oh No.

159
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:25,561
Oh,
wait a minute.

160
00:08:25,561 --> 00:08:27,660
Hand because does even more.
Thirty years ago,

161
00:08:27,661 --> 00:08:30,390
Nicaragua was the guy that the US love 
to hate,

162
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:32,340
but now they've signed a free trade with
America.

163
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,233
The so called Captain Mans,
they celebrate with counselor Naco 

164
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:36,983
operations.
Bear in mind that the American 

165
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,084
agriculture market is protected,
but chocolate coffee and bananas from 

166
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:42,474
Nicaragua as the exception to that rule,
they find it way easier to get into 

167
00:08:45,721 --> 00:08:50,721
those American mark.
This still isn't the end of our story.

168
00:08:53,810 --> 00:08:56,070
Do you remember about special economic 
zones?

169
00:08:56,071 --> 00:08:56,904
I've told you about them in a video 
before basically that an area inside of 

170
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:03,990
a developing country with lower taxes 
and more business friendly rules.

171
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,700
Well,
Nicaragua has got one.

172
00:09:05,820 --> 00:09:08,280
The images you're beginning to see on 
the screen now,

173
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,660
they belong to an ad made by the 
government to attract foreign investors.

174
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,950
If someone was thinking of investing in 
it broadwell,

175
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,813
I would encourage her to come down and I
think they'll find the same advantages 

176
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:24,081
that we found nod with close to the US,
a frog bilingual population availability

177
00:09:25,081 --> 00:09:26,660
of,
of highly educated workforce.

178
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,860
Surprisingly,
it seems this insole.

179
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:32,220
Tiger came to power.
Nicaragua has been flooded with new call

180
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:33,054
centers from international companies.
She played a special taxes and most 

181
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,044
importantly of all the opportunity to do
business in the only country with new 

182
00:09:40,201 --> 00:09:42,720
street violence or guerrillas 
whatsoever.

183
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:45,720
So now you might be wondering what 
happened to Daniel Ortega?

184
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:47,340
Did he have,
if any?

185
00:09:47,560 --> 00:09:49,350
Well,
of course not.

186
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,760
He just learns that when it comes 
through,

187
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:54,290
he does well under your rule.
It's easier to stay in power.

188
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:58,230
This is why in election after election 
or Tavi gets more than 60 percent of the

189
00:09:58,231 --> 00:10:00,840
vote.
Of course these elections are rigged,

190
00:10:00,930 --> 00:10:04,800
but only a fool would say the total 
Tayga has no popular support.

191
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,693
In fact,
there's also another reason for this 

192
00:10:06,541 --> 00:10:07,374
ideological change.
See if the economy of your country is 

193
00:10:09,571 --> 00:10:12,810
doing or rice and you control every 
facet of your country,

194
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,080
your personal finances at giving to the 
procedure.

195
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,980
Dawn,
great.

196
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:19,993
The precedent Daniel Ortega has put his 
wife and sons and important government 

197
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:25,350
positions while his family has gotten 
rich.

198
00:10:25,410 --> 00:10:26,640
Thanks for Venezuelan oil.

199
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:27,713
Meanwhile,
there's government has invested a good 

200
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,800
share of that money in avoiding school 
rivalries.

201
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:32,663
Eventually,
every media station in Nicaragua is 

202
00:10:35,041 --> 00:10:35,874
owned by the governments or some 
businessmen that's connected to Daniel 

203
00:10:39,090 --> 00:10:39,811
Ortega,
and by the way,

204
00:10:39,811 --> 00:10:40,644
there's a new social media law which 
started to be discussed in March of 

205
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:45,330
2018,
and this would allow the ruling class to

206
00:10:45,331 --> 00:10:48,170
censor and chase political activists.
Nonetheless,

207
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:50,420
protests have started for a totally 
different reason.

208
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,530
That's how I look at that.

209
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,330
Why do they protest?
In Nicaragua,

210
00:10:57,460 --> 00:11:01,000
common wisdom says that revolutions 
happen when it comes free.

211
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,190
Isn't a big crisis rice?
Well,

212
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:04,960
that's actually a big mistake.
In fact,

213
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:08,470
revolutions happened when a country was 
going through dire straights,

214
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:10,300
but is now starting to go,

215
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,193
right?

216
00:11:12,840 --> 00:11:13,970
Implying is this.
Well,

217
00:11:13,971 --> 00:11:16,700
basically if nobody around you is 
driving a cadillac,

218
00:11:16,701 --> 00:11:19,220
then they're all cadillacs to be jealous
about.

219
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:20,930
You can probably see where I'm going 
with this.

220
00:11:21,110 --> 00:11:21,943
All of a sudden,
Nicaraguan saw witnessing the advent of 

221
00:11:24,741 --> 00:11:28,060
a brand's knew at least the friends of 
Daniel Ortega.

222
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,690
Yes,
it is true.

223
00:11:32,691 --> 00:11:36,680
The whole country is growing,
but some long growing faster than others

224
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:37,693
and only the most naive believed that 
this new aristocracy got rich entirely 

225
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:41,684
on their own merits.
This is what we call the populist 

226
00:11:44,211 --> 00:11:45,044
moment,
so window of opportunity where the 

227
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:49,880
governments can change.
This is like filling a room with gas.

228
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:54,730
You just need flick of a lighter and 
everything explodes.

229
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,680
Contract Marshall,

230
00:11:57,710 --> 00:12:00,110
I n s,
s law has already passed.

231
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,033
In summary,
the government has decided to lower 

232
00:12:02,481 --> 00:12:05,090
pension swell,
increasing contributions.

233
00:12:05,180 --> 00:12:06,013
Businessmen,
workers and students have taken to the 

234
00:12:07,821 --> 00:12:10,670
streets like that.
Spent years waiting for the opportunity.

235
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:17,140
Thousands of people protesting and the 
government's.

236
00:12:17,260 --> 00:12:18,760
The government doesn't know how to 
react.

237
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:19,743
This is why they have forced all the 
Nicaraguan TV stations to stop 

238
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:23,763
broadcasting the demonstrations.
Despite all of this protests being 

239
00:12:26,561 --> 00:12:29,590
organized all over the country,
not only in the capital,

240
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:30,963
even in its smallest villages in facts,
we know about this because we've saved 

241
00:12:33,551 --> 00:12:36,520
thousands of messages from protestors.
As you probably know,

242
00:12:36,521 --> 00:12:37,354
visual politics also got a Spanish 
language version and those he watched 

243
00:12:39,971 --> 00:12:40,804
that channel from Nicaragua.
I've sent hundreds of videos from 

244
00:12:43,361 --> 00:12:48,361
universities in these videos.
You can see that students,

245
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:53,670
they've been sitting there for days,
people bringing them food and water,

246
00:12:53,671 --> 00:12:54,504
but then a policeman will come and take 
it away and we have plenty of images of 

247
00:12:57,271 --> 00:12:59,280
police brutality.
We're not going to show here,

248
00:12:59,520 --> 00:13:02,410
but trust us when we say that the 
Nicaraguan police,

249
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:06,120
they're doing everything they can to 
repress these protests.

250
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:11,100
It's big time clash forces in what used 
to be the most peaceful country in South

251
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:11,190
Korea.

252
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,023
Okay.

253
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:19,720
Now the question you might ask is,
is this the end of Daniel Ortega's role?

254
00:13:19,770 --> 00:13:21,460
And as we always say here,
visual politic,

255
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:25,610
you can never make accurate predictions 
when it comes to politics and economics.

256
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:28,070
Having almost a protest as doesn't 
really mean anything.

257
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:29,083
In fact,
we still don't know if all these 

258
00:13:30,621 --> 00:13:33,320
political activists serve a common cause
or a common leader.

259
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,273
According to the messages we get some 
liberal factions as well as some die 

260
00:13:37,561 --> 00:13:42,290
hard Sandinista people who feel the 
trade by Mr Ortega's ideological shift.

261
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:48,670
As you can imagine,
things like special economic zones,

262
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:51,160
not very Marxist Leninist.
In other words,

263
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:52,023
so far,
there isn't much organization and 

264
00:13:53,861 --> 00:13:54,694
there's no real leader that can 
capitalize on all this popular unrest 

265
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,470
with.
Now this is hard to offer.

266
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:01,540
A real alternative to the official.
Yeah,

267
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,423
power.

268
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:08,970
That's our opinion.
Here are visual politic.

269
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:12,750
Now we'd like to know yours.
What do you think is going to happen?

270
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,584
Do you really think Daniel Ortega will 
have to step down from power or will we 

271
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:19,830
see many more years of Sandy aneurysm?
