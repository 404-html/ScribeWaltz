1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:13,230
There's no secret the great us 
locomotive is working at full speed.

2
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:18,370
Okay.

3
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:26,790
Ten years of uninterrupted growth.
The North American economy is enjoying a

4
00:00:26,791 --> 00:00:29,550
wonderful moments.
You had employment rate lines below four

5
00:00:29,551 --> 00:00:34,260
percent is lowest level since the year 
2000 and every month more than a 100,000

6
00:00:34,261 --> 00:00:39,261
new jobs are created.
Salaries are also growing,

7
00:00:39,381 --> 00:00:43,220
and then the last three years alone,
almost 8 million jobs have been created.

8
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:46,130
In addition,
industrial production and exports are at

9
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,860
historically high levels,
even in spite of their last stumbled,

10
00:00:49,861 --> 00:00:52,940
the SNP 500 has exploded in recent 
years.

11
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:53,774
The locomotive is absolutely soaring it,
but hold on a second because the US 

12
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:02,504
economy has another face and it's a face
we've already spoken about here on 

13
00:01:05,241 --> 00:01:10,241
visual politic debut is the American 
economy,

14
00:01:14,581 --> 00:01:19,170
especially the government is addicted to
credit and debt that right.

15
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,153
You're saying September the 30th,
2018 marks the end of the federal 

16
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:24,840
government's budget.
Yeah.

17
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:25,763
And here's a question for you.
Can you tell me how much the federal 

18
00:01:28,801 --> 00:01:33,801
debt increased by in this year alone?
Actually it's about $40,000

19
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,243
or what's your.
The onset is no less than one point 

20
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:51,740
$3,000,000,000,000.
This amount surpasses the entire Mexican

21
00:01:51,871 --> 00:01:52,700
GDP.

22
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:56,900
We are living on borrowed money,
borrowed time,

23
00:01:57,980 --> 00:02:02,780
these hike interest rates,
clobber exports,

24
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,820
stumped,
investment,

25
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:08,790
killed jobs,
undermine growth.

26
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,293
She our kit and shrink our future.
It's time to ask why it is that we have 

27
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:17,684
run up more debt in this country in the 
last eight years than we did in the 

28
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:26,240
previous 200 and to make sure it never 
happens again.

29
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:33,730
I'm

30
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:35,470
worried about the federal government 
here.

31
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:36,333
The economy is growing,
but the public deficit is out of 

32
00:02:38,351 --> 00:02:39,490
control.
By the way,

33
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,190
just in the last year with Donald trump 
in the White House,

34
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,093
government spending grew by seven 
percent and it looks like things are 

35
00:02:45,611 --> 00:02:47,410
going to get worse,
much worse.

36
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,303
Congress' budget office estimates that 
if they stay on this path in less than 

37
00:02:51,851 --> 00:02:52,684
10 years,
interest payments alone will cost the 

38
00:02:54,551 --> 00:02:59,290
federal governments more than $900,
billion dollars every single year.

39
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
However,
the federal government isn't the only 

40
00:03:01,331 --> 00:03:03,280
debt junkie.
Listen to this,

41
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:14,960
the states,
the hidden debt let me grow as an income

42
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,273
in 2017.
Thirty nine of the 50 states that make 

43
00:03:19,501 --> 00:03:20,334
up the United States had surpluses.
That is they made more money than they 

44
00:03:23,761 --> 00:03:24,594
spent.

45
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:26,103
Yeah.

46
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,610
Years of adjusting.
Now,

47
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,160
the question that many governors are 
asking themselves is,

48
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:32,680
well,
what's the best way to spend all of this

49
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:37,681
money?
And on top of that,

50
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,593
since 2010,
every state's collection has increased 

51
00:03:41,031 --> 00:03:43,910
by 40 percent.
So we're really not talking about just a

52
00:03:43,911 --> 00:03:45,320
few cents out.
Finally,

53
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:47,810
states have resources to invest in 
infrastructure,

54
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,600
education,
social services,

55
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,503
etc.
Then this might all sound pretty good 

56
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,030
rice.
Well,

57
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:56,150
sadly The truth is a little different.
In fact,

58
00:03:56,151 --> 00:04:01,151
it's actually quite a lot different.
You see,

59
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,704
in principle,
every state except for Vermont has to 

60
00:04:04,961 --> 00:04:06,880
have a balanced budget.
However,

61
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:10,330
despite this and all the parents 
announced surpluses,

62
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:15,360
the truth is that all of the states 
won't stop accumulating debt obligations

63
00:04:15,401 --> 00:04:17,590
and liabilities of all kinds.
In fact,

64
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:20,280
nowadays every stage drags according to 
the think tank.

65
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,123
Truth and accounting.
A heavy load of more than one point 5 

66
00:04:24,370 --> 00:04:29,370
trillion in unfunded debt is that the 
vast majority,

67
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:31,933
no less than 40 of the 50 states,
don't have the resources to face all of 

68
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:36,830
the commitments that they've gotten 
themselves into.

69
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,180
Well,
hold on a second.

70
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:39,014
Yeah,
because how the hell can states 

71
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,350
accumulate desk while their budgets are 
balanced?

72
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,213
Well,
basically by doing all kinds of 

73
00:04:44,811 --> 00:04:45,644
accounting tricks after old politicians 
and elected officials are most 

74
00:04:48,621 --> 00:04:52,370
interested in masking that figures and 
spending every penny.

75
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,120
I mean if we're honest about it.
This is kind of how elections are won.

76
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:03,290
Did they say they use many tricks from 
inflating income assumptions?

77
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:04,124
do you delaying bill payments,
but the most important trick of all is 

78
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:08,173
one that has to do with pensions and 
benefits for public employees when they 

79
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:12,250
retire.

80
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,083
Yes.

81
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:14,683
AlloW me to explain.
In order to gain votes and get along 

82
00:05:16,491 --> 00:05:17,324
with union state,
governments tend to promise public 

83
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:19,694
employees very good pensions as well as 
lots of additional benefits of paul 

84
00:05:22,291 --> 00:05:22,980
never time

85
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:23,813
right.

86
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:27,730
Given how the pension system works in 
the United States,

87
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:28,564
this assumes that each month state 
governments have to contribute to the 

88
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,070
amounts they committed to to a pension 
fund,

89
00:05:33,071 --> 00:05:35,710
so there's tomorrow.
all those public workers can collect the

90
00:05:35,711 --> 00:05:36,610
pensions that they were.

91
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,160
However,

92
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:40,993
just for a second,
let's put ourselves in the place of the 

93
00:05:42,831 --> 00:05:45,470
politicians in charge of the state 
government.

94
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:48,440
What if instead of depositing all that 
money into a pension funds,

95
00:05:48,441 --> 00:05:51,230
we invest in all kinds of public 
spending programs.

96
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:54,630
That way we can finance and lots of 
projects which will make us win lots of.

97
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:55,431
Oops,
okay,

98
00:05:55,431 --> 00:05:57,190
so some of you mIght now be thinking,
in fact,

99
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:58,700
all of you are probably thinking,
well,

100
00:05:58,701 --> 00:05:59,534
what's going to happen to all of those 
employees when they start retiring and 

101
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,650
claiming those pensions and those 
benefits?

102
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,513
The how are they going to be paid?
And the answer is it doesn't really 

103
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:07,364
matter it.
Remember you're a politician that's 

104
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:10,880
going to be someone else's problem way 
down the line.

105
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:13,580
You just need to worry about winning the
next election.

106
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:14,270
Well,
folks,

107
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,103
according to the data it really looks 
like that is actually the thought that 

108
00:06:18,171 --> 00:06:22,760
many state politicians have.
Hat state and local governments made big

109
00:06:22,761 --> 00:06:23,594
commitments,
particularly on pensions and retiree 

110
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,453
healthcare,
but didn't adequately fund those 

111
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,810
liabilities.
Mr.

112
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:30,643
Brennan,
a democrat and mayor of hartford in 

113
00:06:32,401 --> 00:06:35,120
total only regarding unfunded state 
pensions,

114
00:06:35,121 --> 00:06:38,480
the state debts already exceed 
$800,000,000,000.

115
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,343
The big question is knowing how the hell
they're going to be able to cope with 

116
00:06:42,111 --> 00:06:42,944
this huge amounts of debt,
but of course not every state is the 

117
00:06:45,771 --> 00:06:47,090
same,
so listen up

118
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:59,210
best and worst.
If we think about it for a moment,

119
00:06:59,401 --> 00:07:03,600
it's easY to understand.
Politicians have a gigantic incentive to

120
00:07:03,601 --> 00:07:04,434
spend every last penny after all that 
entire future depends on the next 

121
00:07:08,611 --> 00:07:11,170
election cycle.
That's why it's so important.

122
00:07:11,190 --> 00:07:12,023
In fact,
it's absolutely essential to not only 

123
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,334
have counterweights,
but also for civil society to be 

124
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:17,213
attentive and very demanding.
But let's go back to the case of the 

125
00:07:20,251 --> 00:07:25,251
United States.
As we've seen,

126
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:32,910
they aren't dragging a colossal unfunded
debt of one point $5,000,000,000,000.

127
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,773
However,
not every state is in the same 

128
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:36,930
situation.
Out of the countries 50 states,

129
00:07:36,931 --> 00:07:37,764
at least 40,
don't have enough assets today to face 

130
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,520
all of their obligations.
Of course,

131
00:07:41,521 --> 00:07:43,680
though some states are better off than 
others.

132
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,553
In any case,
there are 10 states where politicians 

133
00:07:46,501 --> 00:07:47,334
have been responsible enough to 
guarantee their state's future and keep 

134
00:07:50,071 --> 00:07:54,100
their accounts in order.
Well,

135
00:07:54,101 --> 00:07:54,934
these are the 10 states that really did 
their homework and we think they've 

136
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,140
earned the right to actually get a 
mention.

137
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:00,790
It would be Alaska,
North Dakota,

138
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:01,601
Wyoming,
Utah,

139
00:08:01,601 --> 00:08:02,800
South Dakota,
Idaho,

140
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:04,210
Tennessee,
Nebraska,

141
00:08:04,390 --> 00:08:05,800
Oregon,
and Iowa.

142
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:09,730
As you can see,
almost all of them,

143
00:08:09,731 --> 00:08:10,564
with the exception of Oregon and Iowa 
are strongly republican states and 

144
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:15,970
democrats should really start looking at
it.

145
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,990
Yes.

146
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,620
The fact is that all the other states 
currently haVe a negative balance,

147
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,513
of course,
to get a better idea of what we're 

148
00:08:27,031 --> 00:08:29,430
talking about.
Let's take a look a the following graph.

149
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:32,220
This shows the top five and bottom five 
states.

150
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,020
Data is expressed in dollars per 
taxpayer and yep,

151
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,500
you are looking at it right.
While states such as North Dakota,

152
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:45,640
Wyoming,
and Iowa,

153
00:08:45,641 --> 00:08:46,474
I've been responsible and have 
accumulated enough savings to meet all 

154
00:08:48,731 --> 00:08:49,564
of their obligations and even have 
surpluses to invest in benefit each 

155
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:53,670
state.
Illinois,

156
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:54,543
Connecticut,
and New Jersey dragging a terrifying 

157
00:08:56,671 --> 00:09:00,020
load of more than $58,000
per taxpayer.

158
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:04,270
Of course,
at this point,

159
00:09:04,271 --> 00:09:05,190
the question is,
well,

160
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,050
how enough,
uh,

161
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:09,220
all the states going to be able to cover
their obligations.

162
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:10,083
The answer isn't simple because the 
situation of some states as we saw in 

163
00:09:12,881 --> 00:09:15,970
the case of Illinois,
Connecticut and New Jersey is so bad,

164
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,000
but finding a solution is really hard.
Check this out.

165
00:09:26,950 --> 00:09:27,783
In new jesse's case,
wHich is the worst off of all the 

166
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:30,504
states,
the fiscal hold amounts to almost 

167
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:34,650
$200,000,000,000.
That is to say this whole,

168
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:38,010
which belongs to a state that has a 
little over 9 million inhabitants,

169
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,873
is larger than the economy of Qatar and 
almost as big as the economies of 

170
00:09:42,811 --> 00:09:46,770
countries like New Zealand or Peru.
it's pretty damn crazy.

171
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,270
In any case,
what we can say is that ultimately there

172
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:54,520
are only two possible ways to solve 
this.

173
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:57,220
Either they raise taxes or cut spending.

174
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,143
The problem is that raising taxes may 
not even be an option because it can 

175
00:10:02,911 --> 00:10:06,020
damage the state's economic potential 
and drive away taxpayers,

176
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,100
especially those who have large 
fortunes.

177
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,993
That's precisely what happens in 
Connecticut where in recent years a lot 

178
00:10:11,191 --> 00:10:12,024
of big businessmen have fled the state 
because of high taxes in comparison to 

179
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:20,240
other territories within the us,
and it wasn't only Connecticut in 2016,

180
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,740
the last year for which we have data.
600,000

181
00:10:25,741 --> 00:10:30,741
people moved from the 25 states with the
highest access to the 25 states with the

182
00:10:31,021 --> 00:10:31,854
lowest taxes and also donald trump's 
latest fiscal reform at really looks as 

183
00:10:37,321 --> 00:10:41,010
if this process is going to speed up,
but that's something we're going to talk

184
00:10:41,011 --> 00:10:41,844
about in a future video so far.
You can see that the debt addiction is 

185
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:48,270
far from being an elusive federal 
government problem.

186
00:10:48,420 --> 00:10:52,230
The us economy is going strong,
but this is the other side of the coin.

187
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,580
The truth is that for the country's 
growth to remain sustainable,

188
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,493
both the federal government and the 
state governments need to finally start 

189
00:11:02,681 --> 00:11:06,430
taking the whole deficits and public 
debt issue very seriously.

190
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,353
It is not normal for a country with such
a high amount of growth to have assumed 

191
00:11:10,470 --> 00:11:14,550
many public accounting balances and this
leads to big questions like what's going

192
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,980
to happen when it all goes wrong and 
what's the limit to having so much debt?

193
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,480
Because folks,
let's not forget,

194
00:11:19,481 --> 00:11:24,481
sooner or later in one way or another,
public debt always has to be paid.
