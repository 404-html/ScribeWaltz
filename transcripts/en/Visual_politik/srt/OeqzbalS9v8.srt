1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:11,640
They were visual politic when not 
exactly massive fans of Donald Trump.

3
00:00:11,641 --> 00:00:13,800
As viewers of our Spanish language 
channel,

4
00:00:13,801 --> 00:00:14,634
we'll note particularly however,
there is one area where we must admit 

5
00:00:18,301 --> 00:00:23,190
the Donald Trump is absolutely correct.
If you want to be a citizen of Mexico,

6
00:00:23,191 --> 00:00:25,820
you and let's assume you're a perfect 
person,

7
00:00:25,850 --> 00:00:27,170
okay?
You want to be,

8
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,940
you could not become a citizen of 
Mexico.

9
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:31,430
It's the hardest place just about in the
country,

10
00:00:31,431 --> 00:00:34,490
in the world to become a citizen.
In this case,

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,930
Donald Trump is telling the truth.
Mexico has an immigration policy that is

12
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:41,240
way more restrictive than the American 
one.

13
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:42,253
To understand this Pesa in 2015 the 
Mexican government is kicked out of its 

14
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:47,450
country.
100,000

15
00:00:47,451 --> 00:00:49,820
foreign is one.
It's the neighbor to the north kicks out

16
00:00:49,821 --> 00:00:52,760
of 300 thousands okay,
so actually on the face of things,

17
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:55,670
it looks as if the u s deports more 
people than Mexico.

18
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:56,990
Rice,
I mean 300,000

19
00:00:56,991 --> 00:00:57,824
versus 100,000
but you really must think about this in 

20
00:00:59,991 --> 00:01:00,824
relative terms,
but one Mexico's population is three 

21
00:01:03,141 --> 00:01:03,974
times smaller than the United States and
it's also a far less attractive 

22
00:01:06,831 --> 00:01:08,330
destination for immigrant.

23
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:17,240
That's it.

24
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:18,073
We can say that the Mexican authorities 
deport nearly everyone who crosses into 

25
00:01:21,891 --> 00:01:22,724
the country through their southern 
border with the leaves and Guatemala is 

26
00:01:25,911 --> 00:01:26,744
that is the deport all of the people who
decide to stay in Mexico rather than 

27
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,460
heading further north to the United 
States.

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:32,353
In fact,
while America has an immigrant 

29
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:37,790
population of 14% which is by the way 
average in terms of developed countries,

30
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:41,120
Mexico has an immigrant population on 
just one.

31
00:01:45,370 --> 00:01:46,203
In fact,

32
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:49,300
well the Mexican presidents on Recap 
Pinion,

33
00:01:49,301 --> 00:01:54,301
yet always saying this to Donald Trump,
we'll make you or Nesta,

34
00:01:56,150 --> 00:02:00,040
Mexicans living in us are honest,
hardworking people.

35
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,310
They are good people.
They respect family,

36
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:06,970
they respect their communities and they 
deserve respect,

37
00:02:08,180 --> 00:02:09,013
will make you medicine and respectful.
They told us 48% of the Mexican 

38
00:02:14,021 --> 00:02:14,854
population holds a negative or very 
negative opinion about immigrants from 

39
00:02:18,451 --> 00:02:19,950
Central America.
In fact,

40
00:02:19,951 --> 00:02:24,180
in 2016 a Mexican newspaper called La,
Yana published the following,

41
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:27,860
yes

42
00:02:27,860 --> 00:02:30,770
to the border wall,
but in the south of Mexico,

43
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,143
the problems between the u s and Mexico 
can be solved by building a border like 

44
00:02:35,751 --> 00:02:36,584
the one proposed by Donald Trump,
but in the south so we can keep illegal 

45
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:43,660
aliens out of Central American.
It's so rather interesting.

46
00:02:43,661 --> 00:02:46,150
Right,
and that's why in today's visual politic

47
00:02:46,151 --> 00:02:46,984
video,
were you going to be looking in to 

48
00:02:48,071 --> 00:02:49,890
Mexico's immigration policy?

49
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:52,680
Why?
Why does

50
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,830
Mexico Deport Central American 
immigrants?

51
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:56,693
The first thing that we need to 
understand before talking about 

52
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,690
immigration to is their geographical 
location.

53
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:02,583
What's imagine that you live in 
Nicaragua and you want to move to the 

54
00:03:05,021 --> 00:03:07,720
United States.
Let's also say that you have no money to

55
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,670
purchase a plane tickets.
In this case,

56
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:10,504
the only way for you to get from 
Nicaragua to the United States is by 

57
00:03:13,691 --> 00:03:16,590
land,
and that means going through Mexico.

58
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,463
Currently,
the biggest flow of immigrants in the 

59
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:21,790
world is from Central America to the 
United States.

60
00:03:26,330 --> 00:03:29,960
And and 15 alone,
over 22 million people made this trip.

61
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,943
It's an extremely dangerous journey on 
roads that are in terrible condition as 

62
00:03:34,221 --> 00:03:37,610
immigrants also passed through some 
incredibly violent areas.

63
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:40,470
And don't forget Mexican states like 
chip pass ski area.

64
00:03:40,471 --> 00:03:43,010
When a lower the hotspots for drug 
trafficking,

65
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:48,800
they suffer all kinds of abuses,
extortion,

66
00:03:48,801 --> 00:03:50,840
kidnapping,
human trafficking,

67
00:03:51,050 --> 00:03:53,880
drug trafficking,
human and sexual slavery.

68
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,170
Right.
Do you understand this best when some of

69
00:03:57,171 --> 00:03:58,004
the immigrants arrive in the south of 
Mexico and they have to continue that 

70
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:03,380
journey to the US on the reef of a 
train?

71
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:06,590
This train has become known as the beast
or the death train,

72
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:09,150
and it's not hard to figure out why.
With Amenia key,

73
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:12,920
this is why some immigrants' decide to 
stay in Mexico.

74
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:17,080
This situation was the perfect excuse 
for the Mexican government to pass it,

75
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:20,510
the lady to properly RCR or population 
law.

76
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:21,403
This was passed in the mid 1970s the law
was Paulie put in place in order to 

77
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:26,114
restrict the flow of immigrants to the 
country in order to avoid human 

78
00:04:29,031 --> 00:04:29,864
trafficking and abuse.
So this sounds like a well intentioned 

79
00:04:32,421 --> 00:04:34,370
law.
So what exactly was the problem?

80
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:36,470
Well,
what's it first appeared to be something

81
00:04:36,471 --> 00:04:38,810
good for foreigners.
It quickly became hell for them.

82
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:39,763
And now you might be wondering what 
exactly made this law quite so bad for 

83
00:04:42,711 --> 00:04:43,700
immigrants.
Well,

84
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:44,534
quite simply,
it gave the government the power to 

85
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:48,560
expel foreigners or reasons as ludicrous
as this one,

86
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,433
the secretary can the knife 40 nurse and
trans to the country or change the 

87
00:04:56,221 --> 00:04:57,054
quality or characteristics of the 
migration in order to keep at 

88
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:01,404
demographic balance and otherwise Mexico
only once immigrants from wealthy 

89
00:05:06,121 --> 00:05:08,190
countries.
And if possible,

90
00:05:08,191 --> 00:05:10,710
it's better if this skin is white as 
well.

91
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,300
What's the result of all this?
Well,

92
00:05:12,301 --> 00:05:17,301
it turns out that seven out of every 10 
immigrants to Mexico off from the United

93
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:18,480
States.
And what about the rest of them?

94
00:05:18,481 --> 00:05:21,300
What about that other three wells,
they're mostly from Spain.

95
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:24,360
In fact in Mexican has twice as many 
Spaniards living in it does it?

96
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:25,194
Does Guatemala.
Now this wouldn't exactly be a big 

97
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:28,254
surprise except for the fact of the 
Guatemala shares a border with Mexico 

98
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,800
and Spain is thousands of miles away 
across in,

99
00:05:35,130 --> 00:05:35,963
Yup.

100
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,593
This is not all Mexico has an equal 
number of German immigrants as it does 

101
00:05:43,931 --> 00:05:47,770
Peruvians.
So if you come from Europe or the United

102
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,603
States,
you're going to have no problem getting 

103
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:51,960
a visa for Mexico.
Lee,

104
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:55,270
your helping to improve that demographic
balance.

105
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,183
But if you happen to be from Peru,
wants to live in the country of Robert 

106
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:00,313
Rodriguez,
well good luck to the Mexican 

107
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:04,400
governments.
You on nothing more than a demographic

108
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,483
rats.

109
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,383
Hold on for a second because there's 
more according to the previous and he 

110
00:06:13,151 --> 00:06:13,984
mentions law.
Being an immigrant in Mexico is a 

111
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:17,794
felony.
This means that at any moments of 

112
00:06:19,271 --> 00:06:20,104
federal agents can request your 
documentation and if you don't have the 

113
00:06:22,961 --> 00:06:24,700
documentation,
you can be forced to leave.

114
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:29,010
Country ends pay a fine of two months 
average salary in Mexico.

115
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,611
Okay.
Okay,

116
00:06:29,611 --> 00:06:30,840
so now you might be thinking,
well,

117
00:06:30,841 --> 00:06:33,450
every country gets to determine its own 
immigration policy,

118
00:06:33,630 --> 00:06:34,463
right?
Well that's absolutely right and until 

119
00:06:36,001 --> 00:06:36,834
2010 no other governments complains 
about Mexico's immigration policy in 

120
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:45,700
2010 something happens that embarrassed 
the entire night.

121
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:47,043
Patient,

122
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:53,480
governor Jan Brewer on Friday signed the
states immigration bill in low.

123
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:57,290
It is considered to be among the 
toughest legislation in the nation.

124
00:06:57,620 --> 00:06:58,453
As ironic as it sounds,
that rezone a law which was meant to 

125
00:07:00,861 --> 00:07:01,694
stop immigrants from Mexico,
was a copy of that same Mexican law 

126
00:07:05,510 --> 00:07:06,343
birds.
Actually in practice it was slightly 

127
00:07:07,641 --> 00:07:09,230
less extreme.
For example,

128
00:07:09,231 --> 00:07:10,064
while Arizona's government considers it 
to be a felony to be an illegal 

129
00:07:13,221 --> 00:07:15,620
immigrants,
it doesn't really matter because Arizona

130
00:07:15,621 --> 00:07:18,200
State's law doesn't apply to the federal
government,

131
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:20,960
so the reality was the federal police 
could do nothing.

132
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,123
Nevertheless,
vis law caught the attention of the 

133
00:07:23,571 --> 00:07:24,404
world's media and the president of bank 
then Philippe cals around didn't remain 

134
00:07:27,681 --> 00:07:32,681
silence doll that gets the same brain 
[inaudible] collection,

135
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:33,963
criminalizes immigration,
social phenomenon and economic 

136
00:07:37,181 --> 00:07:38,014
phenomena.
Every load that penalizes it opening up 

137
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,440
the door for intolerance and 
discrimination as well.

138
00:07:47,141 --> 00:07:49,270
There you have it since then,
day diction.

139
00:07:49,271 --> 00:07:50,104
Reason next to the word hypocrisy have 
started including a picture of Philippe 

140
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,673
Calderon wrong and quickly following 
this statement came the world's 

141
00:07:56,711 --> 00:07:57,544
reaction.
The Mexican government were forced to 

142
00:07:59,141 --> 00:08:01,660
change to that population law that we 
mentioned.

143
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,523
This meant that immigration to Mexico 
wasn't no longer eight felony was do 

144
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,640
hold on that for just one second because
that is not the end of us.

145
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:09,673
Boring.

146
00:08:13,150 --> 00:08:13,901
Yes,
it is true.

147
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:17,440
The Mexico changed its immigration law,
but it didn't diesel entirely.

148
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,523
Remember when I said to the Mexican 
federal police can request the 

149
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:23,200
documentation of any person at any time.
Well,

150
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:27,280
that is still happening today.
Today in the United States,

151
00:08:27,281 --> 00:08:29,890
the authorities need to suspect you of 
committing a crime.

152
00:08:29,891 --> 00:08:31,750
If they want to ask you the 
documentation,

153
00:08:31,870 --> 00:08:35,170
this means is over and easy for them to 
stop you on the street and to rescue for

154
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,060
being then legal immigrants.
Meanwhile,

155
00:08:37,061 --> 00:08:37,894
down in Mexico,
this is happening every single day adds 

156
00:08:40,691 --> 00:08:41,524
of this.
The limited control over the country 

157
00:08:42,431 --> 00:08:45,310
have over their own police force and you
get stories like this.

158
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:50,490
Escape

159
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,323
deportation migrants often pay bribes to
inm agents of between and $300 and of 

160
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,434
course the mass deportations of Central 
American immigrants remain exactly the 

161
00:09:01,081 --> 00:09:01,914
same.
But do you really think that Mexico is 

162
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:07,890
the only place where this is happening?
Because the answer is absolutely not.

163
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,960
Now.
Normally when we talk about immigration,

164
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:12,810
we're normally talking about people who 
are living in a poor country,

165
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,400
moving to a rich country.

166
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:24,250
[inaudible]

167
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:25,543
there's,
there's in 2015 over 80 million people 

168
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:31,370
moved from one poor country to a another
poor country.

169
00:09:31,430 --> 00:09:32,263
They were just moving to a poor country 
that is slightly better off than that 

170
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:36,920
original country.
As an example,

171
00:09:36,921 --> 00:09:37,754
every year thousands of people move from
Bangladesh to India and the authorities 

172
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,090
don't exactly welcomed them with open 
arms.

173
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:44,953
Just consider what Narendra Modi sets 
the Indian presidents when he was 

174
00:09:47,871 --> 00:09:48,704
running for office.
You can write it down after Mexico 

175
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,020
[inaudible] these Bangladeshis better be
prepared with their backs packed.

176
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,143
This is really a big difference when 
compared to the immigrant friendly 

177
00:10:03,031 --> 00:10:06,090
policies of countries like Canada or New
Zealand,

178
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:09,540
which by the way are some of the 
wealthiest countries in the world.

179
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:18,330
This is just our opinion here at the 
visual politic and we would love to know

180
00:10:18,331 --> 00:10:19,164
what you think.
Do you think that Europe and the United 

181
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,540
States should follow examples set by 
countries like Mexico and India,

182
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:28,260
or follow the examples of countries like
Canada and New Zealand?

183
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,930
