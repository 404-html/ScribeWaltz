1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,293
Bangladesh is the only country with an 
Islamic majority whose president is a 

2
00:00:11,181 --> 00:00:13,550
woman.
Her name is Shankar on ads.

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,384
This is not a literal example.
We're talking about the third biggest 

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:20,330
Muslim country with more than 160 
million inhabitants.

5
00:00:20,540 --> 00:00:22,200
Nonetheless,
there is one Bangladeshi,

6
00:00:22,220 --> 00:00:25,030
even more famous than shake Asina.
This is Mohammed,

7
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:25,883
you know,
sees the Nobel Peace Prize winner as 

8
00:00:27,291 --> 00:00:30,050
well as the inventor of micro credits is
also from Bangalore

9
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:30,883
Dash.

10
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:38,870
This is surprising given that in this 
country,

11
00:00:38,871 --> 00:00:41,800
only at one out of every three citizens 
has a bank accounts.

12
00:00:41,830 --> 00:00:42,663
It's like Bangladesh is one of the 
fastest growing economies of the last 

13
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:46,513
few years.
They have reduced poverty faster than 

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,883
anyone else and they are also the 
world's second largest textile 

15
00:00:51,561 --> 00:00:54,020
manufacturer,
only surpassed by China.

16
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,033
But despite all of that,
most of the Bangladeshi people still 

17
00:00:57,561 --> 00:00:59,930
keep them money at home.
So now you might be wondering,

18
00:00:59,931 --> 00:01:00,800
well,
why is this,

19
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:01,634
what exactly is going on in Bangladesh 
that causes people not to trust the 

20
00:01:04,551 --> 00:01:05,384
bank?

21
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,310
Well,
the answer to this,

22
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:12,630
well,
it's religion.

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:16,020
According to Islam.
Lending money with interest is a sin and

24
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,630
90 percent of the Bangladeshi people are
Muslim,

25
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:19,493
but wait just a minute here because 
things are changing in the last few 

26
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:23,873
decades,
Muslim countries have created a system 

27
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,673
that allows saving and lending money,
which also meets that Islamic 

28
00:01:28,501 --> 00:01:29,700
principles.
Yes,

29
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:30,563
dear viewer.
We are talking of course about Islamic 

30
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:33,624
banking,
a phenomenon that is becoming more and 

31
00:01:35,101 --> 00:01:35,934
more important in Bangladesh,
and you might think that this is great 

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:40,530
news for the governments of shakers 
scene of rice.

33
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:41,490
Well,
in fact,

34
00:01:41,491 --> 00:01:42,900
the opposite is actually true.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,800
Islami back Bangladesh is most watched 
bankers,

36
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:49,693
so now the question becomes why does the
government of Bangladesh distrust 

37
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:54,770
Islamic banking?
And it's more importantly,

38
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:57,710
what role might Islamic banking having 
the future of Bangladesh?

39
00:01:57,711 --> 00:01:58,544
Well,
today we're going to answer those 

40
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:00,590
questions,
but before we do,

41
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:05,740
let's answer the most important question
of all Islamic banking all about.

42
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,133
Okay,
so imagine we have a thousand American 

43
00:02:10,821 --> 00:02:11,654
dollars and they're just sitting in a 
savings accounts are western bank can 

44
00:02:13,791 --> 00:02:16,550
give you an interest rate of say,
three percent.

45
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,530
Now unsure.
Many of you have wondered,

46
00:02:18,531 --> 00:02:19,364
well,
how is it possible that a bank just 

47
00:02:20,091 --> 00:02:22,520
gives us money for money that is simply 
sitting in it,

48
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,050
but where's the profit here?
Well,

49
00:02:24,051 --> 00:02:25,520
the truth is that that a thousand 
dollars,

50
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:26,383
it's not just staying in the bank safe.
Instead they use that money to lend to 

51
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:31,700
companies and individuals.
Those lanes,

52
00:02:31,701 --> 00:02:32,534
they simply have a higher interest rate 
so the bank makes money and gives us 

53
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:36,373
little sheriff that profits.
This is the basic mechanism of the 

54
00:02:39,291 --> 00:02:40,470
entire system of western

55
00:02:40,580 --> 00:02:41,413
banking.

56
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:45,543
Now obviously this carries some degree 
of risk because the bank can lose the 

57
00:02:48,491 --> 00:02:50,230
money,
but depending on the country we live in,

58
00:02:50,380 --> 00:02:54,940
the is forced by law to keep a small 
percentage of that $1,000,

59
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:57,730
that percentage,
it cannot be humans and it's schools.

60
00:02:57,731 --> 00:02:59,500
The cash ratio.
Now,

61
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:00,334
according to Sharia law,
this system is sinful because lending 

62
00:03:02,531 --> 00:03:05,620
money with interest is seen as unfair.
Of course,

63
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:07,570
there is no problem with keeping your 
client's money,

64
00:03:07,571 --> 00:03:10,830
but you simply can't lend it to anyone 
in economic jargon.

65
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:15,100
This means that Sharia law demands a 100
percent cash ratio.

66
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:23,890
So this in summary,
is the way that Islamic banks work,

67
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,330
and I love you wondering,
well,

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,460
why don't exactly is the business here?
Well,

69
00:03:27,490 --> 00:03:30,970
mainly Islamic banks will make money by 
two means.

70
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,923
First,
the banks charge their clients 

71
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,694
commissions for keeping the money.
So instead of giving you an interest 

72
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:38,950
rate,
Islamic banks can only give you a little

73
00:03:38,951 --> 00:03:40,990
symbolic presence.
This president,

74
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:41,824
it's called the hip Bob.
Another business practice that is 

75
00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,150
allowed by Sharia law is adding over 
costs.

76
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:48,790
For example,
let's say we buy a house with an Islamic

77
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,810
bank.
In this case,

78
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:54,100
the bank will buy the house for us and 
then sell it to us at a higher price.

79
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,010
And this price is called the mercer 
rocket runs.

80
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,853
We can pay for it in installments.
If for whatever reason we can't compete 

81
00:04:00,221 --> 00:04:01,054
the payments,
the bank will sell the house on the 

82
00:04:02,261 --> 00:04:03,094
market.
If they do get some profit from the 

83
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:05,383
selling weed,
the clients can take a share of the 

84
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,370
profits.
But wait just a minute here because this

85
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,860
is not the end of the story.
The current bands,

86
00:04:11,861 --> 00:04:12,694
banks from investing in what they 
considered dirty businesses such as 

87
00:04:15,431 --> 00:04:20,431
tobacco weapons or productive.
There's even a special index.

88
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:27,290
The Dow Jones Islamic markets has 1400 
companies from the New York stock market

89
00:04:27,530 --> 00:04:30,020
where Islamic banks can invest.
As you can imagine,

90
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:34,010
these things are becoming really 
successful in several Muslim countries,

91
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:37,460
but well in Bangladesh,
they are absolutely kicking off.

92
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,783
Islamic banking is growing rapidly in 
Bangladesh with a market share of about 

93
00:04:44,581 --> 00:04:46,500
20 percent.
Do they vent already?

94
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,730
AIDS banks have this kind of Bangladesh,
even Western banks like Citi on starting

95
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,564
to offer banking services for those who 
demand them in a country where brides 

96
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:55,924
are a thing everywhere Islamic banks are
famous for their transparency and good 

97
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,530
practices.
Islamic banks for instance,

98
00:05:01,531 --> 00:05:04,290
a famous of having nothing to do with 
the Bangladeshi government,

99
00:05:12,730 --> 00:05:14,740
so if you want to get a loan from an 
Islamic Bank,

100
00:05:14,741 --> 00:05:15,574
you have to demonstrate the you are a 
reliable clients willing to pay back 

101
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:19,684
your debts,
but hold on a minute here because well 

102
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:25,600
things they are not as good as they 
might seem for these banks.

103
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:31,480
Good Bank,
bad bank,

104
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:32,493
Islamic banking arrived in Bangladesh in
1983 when some Saudi and Kuwaiti hedge 

105
00:05:36,081 --> 00:05:38,860
funds decided to create the Islamic 
Bank.

106
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,030
This bank played a crucial role in 
turning an agricultural country into the

107
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:45,040
textile powerhouse that it is today.

108
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:45,850
Yeah.

109
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:46,683
Today clothes make up 80 percent of 
Bangladeshi exports and Islamic Bank is 

110
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:52,090
the biggest bank in the country.
Nonetheless,

111
00:05:52,091 --> 00:05:55,150
the growth of Islamic banking in the 
country is not clear enough.

112
00:05:59,750 --> 00:06:03,560
Talk about our central bank is not 
giving new Islamic banking licenses.

113
00:06:03,670 --> 00:06:07,760
Even those western banks that once to 
give Islamic banking services must wait.

114
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,773
They clean.
They need to create a brand new 

115
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:12,260
regulations on the matter of Islamic 
banking.

116
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,213
Meanwhile,
the governments of shake and CIENA has 

117
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:15,224
send inspectors to the Islamic bank 
officers and they are surveying all of 

118
00:06:18,051 --> 00:06:18,884
their movements.
Government initiates a coo at 

119
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:30,030
Bangladesh.
Has biggest bank board members receive a

120
00:06:30,031 --> 00:06:31,470
visit from military intelligence?

121
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,660
Yes.

122
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,603
So now you might wonder what is wrong 
with the Islamic banks and the 

123
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:38,880
governments?
Well,

124
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,370
shake a scene of claims that they are 
financing terrorism.

125
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,353
As we explained in another video,
Islamic terrorism is becoming a real 

126
00:06:44,701 --> 00:06:45,534
threat to the country and many people 
think some of these banks might be 

127
00:06:48,001 --> 00:06:53,001
financing terrorist groups.
However,

128
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,720
there are several reasons to make us 
believe that at the end of the day,

129
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:03,440
this is nothing but a power struggle 
shake us.

130
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,274
He loves to take things under her 
control and the fact that the biggest 

131
00:07:06,661 --> 00:07:07,494
bank in the country sympathizes with the
proposals of the opposition party 

132
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,243
certainly does not help.
This is why on January 2017 has seen an 

133
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,483
interview,
interviewed the Islamic Bank and change 

134
00:07:16,561 --> 00:07:21,561
the board of managers by her own son.
Since then,

135
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:23,003
loans have skyrocketed.
The Bangladesh Central Bank itself has 

136
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:27,690
warned that some of these loans are too 
risky.

137
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,583
Meanwhile,
both Saudi and Qac hedge funds that 

138
00:07:30,271 --> 00:07:33,900
created the bank 35 years ago and now 
taking back their money,

139
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,330
they simply don't think it is safe 
anymore,

140
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:39,540
but wait just a minute because this is 
not the first time that shake his senior

141
00:07:39,541 --> 00:07:42,160
is trying to control the financial 
industry in her.

142
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:49,770
You want the guy we mentioned at the 
beginning,

143
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,910
Muhammad Yunus.
Well,

144
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,570
he is in.
Has Seen as cross as to in the year 2006

145
00:07:54,571 --> 00:07:55,404
after some terrorist attacks,
the Bangladeshi army organized acute 

146
00:07:58,230 --> 00:08:01,260
Atar and created a technocratic 
governments.

147
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,153
Back then,
Muhammad Yunus was a favorite 

148
00:08:03,541 --> 00:08:04,374
candidates.
Do you lead that government in the end 

149
00:08:06,330 --> 00:08:07,230
though?
That didn't happen,

150
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:11,760
but Hasina learned a vital lesson.
Beware of the bankers.

151
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:14,190
Sometimes they like to get involved in 
politics.

152
00:08:14,250 --> 00:08:15,083
This is why has seen his first priority 
after taking position in 2008 was to 

153
00:08:18,541 --> 00:08:20,490
take care of Eunice.
First of all,

154
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:23,190
she forced him to resign as the chairman
of his own bag,

155
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:24,024
the grommet.

156
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:33,560
Of course,

157
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:35,840
some of our claims were true and make no
mistake.

158
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,674
Muhammad Yunus is not a perfect guy,
but we're going to talk about this in 

159
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,244
another video,
but as if making him resigned was not 

160
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,644
enough.
Has also started a campaign to diminish 

161
00:08:44,871 --> 00:08:46,880
his image in Bangladeshi society.

162
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:50,340
No Nobel

163
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,173
laureate,
Eunice Got Hillary Clinton to stop web 

164
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:56,880
funding for Padma says Hasina.
In other words,

165
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:57,763
shake us.
He knows how to beat her political 

166
00:08:59,221 --> 00:09:00,990
enemies.
First it was eunice,

167
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:02,430
now it's the Islamic Bank.

168
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,693
So the question is now,
do you think there is an actual 

169
00:09:13,711 --> 00:09:16,540
connection between Islamic banks and 
terrorism for.

170
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:17,374
Is this just an excuse made on by shake 
Asina in order to keep the finance 

171
00:09:20,461 --> 00:09:21,294
industry under control?
And shouldn't Bangladesh allow Islamic 

172
00:09:23,941 --> 00:09:24,774
banks?
Do you operate in the country without 

173
00:09:25,891 --> 00:09:27,030
restrictions?
