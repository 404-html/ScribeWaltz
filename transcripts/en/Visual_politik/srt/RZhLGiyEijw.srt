1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:09,760
El Salvador is a small country,
in fact,

2
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,310
it's the smallest country in all of 
Central America.

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:15,820
Bob,
that's only geographically.

4
00:00:15,860 --> 00:00:18,970
The country has six point 5 million 
inhabitants.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,610
Population that's larger than Panama,
Costa Rica,

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,200
Belize,
or Nicaragua.

7
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,123
That's a large population,
especially when you consider that to 

8
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:31,011
immigration from the country is common 
according to various sources.

9
00:00:31,391 --> 00:00:32,224
Some three to 4 million salvadorians all
living abroad with many living in the 

10
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,730
United States.
Don't tell trump it's disgusting.

11
00:00:39,731 --> 00:00:40,564
I don't want to talk about immigration 
is ever popular with thousands of 

12
00:00:43,151 --> 00:00:43,984
Salvadorians each year,
packing up their suitcases and taking a 

13
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,210
chance on a better future somewhere 
else.

14
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:56,050
It's rate of emigration from El Salvador
maintains itself.

15
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:00,040
Then there might soon be more 
salvadorians living outside El Salvador.

16
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:03,430
Then they're all living inside it.
So now you might be wondering why are so

17
00:01:03,431 --> 00:01:04,264
many people so keen to leave this 
country or you might not be wondering 

18
00:01:07,001 --> 00:01:07,281
that.
It's.

19
00:01:07,281 --> 00:01:08,114
I mean,
we did have to choose a title for this 

20
00:01:09,401 --> 00:01:10,400
video,
but anyway,

21
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,270
so let's have a look at why so many 
people are leaving this country

22
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,220
training.

23
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,373
Yes,
it is true that El Salvador is a very 

24
00:01:18,521 --> 00:01:19,354
poor country,
but economics is not the only reason 

25
00:01:21,911 --> 00:01:23,020
that people are leaving.
Now,

26
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:26,140
before we get into details on what 
exactly is causing this accident,

27
00:01:26,141 --> 00:01:28,300
so let me give you a quick bit of 
information.

28
00:01:28,330 --> 00:01:32,620
El Salvador is a tropical country where 
you can find stunning beaches like these

29
00:01:32,710 --> 00:01:33,543
as well as magnificent nature reserves 
like this one as well as amazing 

30
00:01:36,401 --> 00:01:39,100
cultural remains,
and in 2017,

31
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:43,690
this is a year in which the country 
should be celebrating 2017 marks.

32
00:01:43,691 --> 00:01:45,880
The 25th anniversary of the peace 
agreements,

33
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,670
which puts an end to the bitter and 
cruel civil war,

34
00:01:48,671 --> 00:01:52,840
which lasted more than 12 years and 
caused more than 70,000.

35
00:01:57,990 --> 00:01:58,823
This conflict was between the national 
armed forces and these so called Fera 

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:04,793
Gonzo Marti National Liberation Front.
I left wing paramilitary group which 

37
00:02:05,881 --> 00:02:08,160
counted on the support of the Cuban 
government.

38
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,950
Interestingly,
after the peace agreements,

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,793
this guerrilla group,
it became a political party and today 

40
00:02:12,691 --> 00:02:15,000
they have the presidency of the 
republic.

41
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:16,910
Quite the remarkable change.

42
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:24,450
Oh,
if you cmcs yet.

43
00:02:25,510 --> 00:02:25,780
Now,

44
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:26,613
while this 25th anniversary,
it shouldn't be a reason for 

45
00:02:28,391 --> 00:02:29,224
celebration.
It's pretty hard to celebrate when you 

46
00:02:30,641 --> 00:02:35,641
look at the current situation that El 
Salvador finds itself in the violence,

47
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,423
the 11th of January 2017.
It was a normal Wednesday where nothing 

48
00:02:43,361 --> 00:02:45,730
extraordinary happens that absolutely 
nothing.

49
00:02:45,731 --> 00:02:46,564
So let me explain.
That date ended with a death toll of 

50
00:02:49,091 --> 00:02:49,924
zero in El Salvador and yes,
that unknown events was actually front 

51
00:02:53,171 --> 00:02:54,004
page news.
The reason for this being newsworthy is 

52
00:02:55,571 --> 00:03:00,130
that als Salvador has become one of the 
most dangerous countries in the world.

53
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,050
Now.
It's to give you an idea of how dire the

54
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:05,170
situation is.
Consider this in 2015,

55
00:03:05,171 --> 00:03:06,004
6,617
murders were registered because that is 

56
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:13,340
to say there were 105 murders for every 
$100,000.

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:19,420
This is the highest of any country in 
the world,

58
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:22,630
which is not currently a warzone.
This number is really,

59
00:03:22,631 --> 00:03:26,080
truly terrifying and is perhaps best 
illustrated with a comparison.

60
00:03:26,170 --> 00:03:29,770
If this figure were applied to the UK,
would mean that there were 70,000

61
00:03:29,771 --> 00:03:33,640
murders a year in the country,
and what's the real figure for the UK?

62
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,160
Well,
it's a touch more than 500 murders.

63
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,740
That's a hundred and 14 times less in 
2016 to figures were a bit lower,

64
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,110
but there were still 4,000
murders registered.

65
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:46,000
This is madness.
There have been wars.

66
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:47,080
Well,
as people have died.

67
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,973
Oh,
and believe murder is far from the only 

68
00:03:49,391 --> 00:03:51,490
serious crime getting down in El 
Salvador,

69
00:03:51,520 --> 00:03:52,840
kidnapping,
extortion,

70
00:03:52,841 --> 00:03:55,420
theft.
That all worryingly common.

71
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:57,010
So we're going with this great news.
Well,

72
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,510
who's up for a holiday to El Salvador,
right?

73
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,730
No one.
Oh,

74
00:04:00,731 --> 00:04:01,870
what a surprise.
Now,

75
00:04:01,871 --> 00:04:02,704
given all of this information,
it's probably no surprise to you that 

76
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,473
according to recent surveys,
it's been indicated that nearly half of 

77
00:04:08,441 --> 00:04:09,274
the population of El Salvador wants to 
leave and it's really clear to see that 

78
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:13,144
this violence has consequences and this 
isn't just a fear of crime being 

79
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:16,564
committed against you direct sleep,
but it also affects the standard of 

80
00:04:18,911 --> 00:04:20,800
living of all people in the country.

81
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:21,663
Now,
according to the Salvadorian Central 

82
00:04:22,601 --> 00:04:26,650
Bank violence costs around 4 billion US 
dollars a year,

83
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:28,780
and you know what?
That's not really that surprising.

84
00:04:28,781 --> 00:04:29,471
I mean,
after all,

85
00:04:29,471 --> 00:04:30,304
he wants to invest their money in a 
country where you can be killed at 

86
00:04:32,681 --> 00:04:34,810
pretty much any time.
Don't believe me.

87
00:04:34,811 --> 00:04:35,830
Well,
how about this?

88
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,750
Foreign investment is the lowest in all 
of Central America.

89
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,420
Even regular people are at risk in El 
Salvador.

90
00:04:43,450 --> 00:04:44,283
In fact,
these statistics show that you're more 

91
00:04:45,251 --> 00:04:49,180
likely to be murdered as a bus driver 
rather than a policeman in the country.

92
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,073
In the last five years alone,
street gangs have killed almost 700 bus 

93
00:04:54,191 --> 00:04:59,191
drivers in the regio.
It is known globally,

94
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:04,050
but Latin America does have a serious 
problem with violence and crime.

95
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:07,110
According to a report from the British 
consulting from various can.

96
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,953
Maplecroft glass in America is the 
region where you have the highest risk 

97
00:05:11,101 --> 00:05:13,350
of having a violence crime committed 
against you.

98
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,243
Indeed,
six of the world's 10 most violent 

99
00:05:15,571 --> 00:05:17,030
countries are actually in this room.

100
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:17,913
Sure.

101
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:22,533
More incredible than that though,
is the fact that one in three homicides 

102
00:05:25,541 --> 00:05:29,410
that occur every year globally,
it take place in Latin America,

103
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,303
even within this dangerous environments,
but the northern triangle countries of 

104
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:35,440
central America really take the 
biscuits.

105
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,200
This area is formed of El Salvador,
Honduras,

106
00:05:38,201 --> 00:05:41,950
and Guatemala,
and it is by far the most dangerous area

107
00:05:41,951 --> 00:05:43,360
on the continent.
In fact,

108
00:05:43,361 --> 00:05:44,194
when you do consider,
warzones is actually the most dangerous 

109
00:05:46,211 --> 00:05:47,044
region in the world.
In these countries which are relatively 

110
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,860
smaller,
200,000

111
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:52,740
people have been murdered since $2,000.

112
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:58,573
You.

113
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:01,910
The reality of these numbers is prison.
Easy to see why people want to leave.

114
00:06:01,911 --> 00:06:02,744
You can't walk the streets safely at 
night or wear a watch or a necklace or 

115
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:08,660
start a business without having to pay 
some criminal organization.

116
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:09,523
It kind of sucks.
So the question that must be on your 

117
00:06:11,331 --> 00:06:14,330
mind right now,
but why is there so much violence,

118
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:19,120
right?

119
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,120
Trafficking probably on your mind now is
just why is this so much violence?

120
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,013
Now?
The reality is these countries in 

121
00:06:27,771 --> 00:06:30,770
Central America have not always been 
such a dangerous places.

122
00:06:30,771 --> 00:06:31,604
It could even be considered relatively 
peaceful until about 20 years ago at 

123
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:38,690
least on an individual level boss.
This all started to change by the end of

124
00:06:38,690 --> 00:06:40,670
the eighties and nineties for two 
reasons.

125
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:41,570
Drug trafficking,

126
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,143
right?

127
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:52,220
The drug trafficking.
This is a serious problem in the region.

128
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:53,113
Every year,
22 million Americans use drugs and most 

129
00:06:55,641 --> 00:06:56,474
of them come from South America.
The drug cartels on making an absolute 

130
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:00,343
fortune.

131
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,343
Yes,

132
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:11,603
this isn't anything new,
but this activity has evolved over the 

133
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:14,783
years and just continually found ways to
operate a spice pressure from law 

134
00:07:17,251 --> 00:07:18,084
enforcement's.
The persecution of the famous Colombian 

135
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:23,400
drug cartels led to a shift in route of 
the drugs coming to the US.

136
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,610
Previously it went to Columbia,
to the Caribbean islands to Florida.

137
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:29,280
Now there's a new route that goes 
through Central America,

138
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:30,163
and this is the first big problem.
Central America has become a sort of 

139
00:07:32,881 --> 00:07:36,180
sanctuary for new Mexican drug cartels 
from Central America.

140
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:37,043
They can organize their business high 
drugs and take refuge from justice 

141
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:40,734
whenever needed.

142
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,670
It's like now you're probably getting 
the idea.

143
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:47,950
Experts have calculated that 80 percent 
of the drugs used in the U.

144
00:07:47,951 --> 00:07:48,784
s have to go through Honduras and this 
has led to an extraordinary amounts of 

145
00:07:52,261 --> 00:07:55,020
violence in that region.
Now to the second major problem,

146
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,910
the Morris,
for those of you who don't know them,

147
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:57,773
the Morris Street gangs that engage in 
all kinds of criminal activities like 

148
00:08:00,751 --> 00:08:02,280
theft,
murder or extortion.

149
00:08:02,310 --> 00:08:03,143
Then members are usually young people 
and their organization is relatively 

150
00:08:05,431 --> 00:08:06,264
horizontal,
meaning that they don't have much of an 

151
00:08:07,621 --> 00:08:08,454
organized hierarchy.
They organize an individual criminal 

152
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:11,304
cells which work quite independently 
from one another and do take notes here 

153
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,070
because it is estimated that in these 
three countries alone,

154
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:21,180
the Maris have around 70 to 100,000
members.

155
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:25,270
The most famous of these organizations 
all salvage and barrio 18.

156
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,193
It's both usually fight against each 
other over the control of different 

157
00:08:28,531 --> 00:08:29,364
territories.

158
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:31,933
Hi,
thinking

159
00:08:32,030 --> 00:08:32,863
violence situation is complex.
Many strategies have been used to try 

160
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:39,230
and solve the problem and they have all 
failed.

161
00:08:39,260 --> 00:08:40,093
However,
two initiatives have been put into 

162
00:08:41,511 --> 00:08:42,344
practice lately in order to change the 
reality of these countries and achieve 

163
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:46,424
safety for their citizens.
The first is known as the traditional 

164
00:08:48,951 --> 00:08:49,784
task force.
This is a security apparatus formed by 

165
00:08:51,981 --> 00:08:54,020
police officers,
intelligence experts,

166
00:08:54,021 --> 00:08:56,760
and special units of three countries 
that we've mentioned.

167
00:08:56,850 --> 00:08:58,920
The aim of this group is to find street 
gangs,

168
00:08:58,921 --> 00:08:59,754
drug trafficking and organized crime 
regardless of borders or the group 

169
00:09:02,941 --> 00:09:03,774
receives support,
training and financing from the United 

170
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,280
States.
The idea of this as clear as Kwon,

171
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:10,710
Orlando Hernandez,
the president of Honduras,

172
00:09:10,711 --> 00:09:15,711
likes to say we are going to give them a
taste of their own medicine.

173
00:09:17,130 --> 00:09:20,850
The second initiative is linked to the 
first and it is known as the alliance of

174
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,684
prosperity.
This was launched by the Obama 

175
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,683
Administration,
ended expects to improve the living 

176
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:28,140
conditions and the competitiveness of 
these countries.

177
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:29,003
It's main goal is to create jobs and 
essential infrastructure in order to 

178
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,850
reverse the terrible current situation.
To start,

179
00:09:34,890 --> 00:09:39,420
Washington has already committed to 
spend $750,000,000

180
00:09:39,421 --> 00:09:42,690
in order to support these initiatives.
But the question is really,

181
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:45,000
is there any hope?
And the answer is well,

182
00:09:45,001 --> 00:09:45,834
the sort of has to be Mara Salvatrucha 
has already communicated that they are 

183
00:09:48,541 --> 00:09:50,520
willing to negotiate their own 
dismantling,

184
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:52,060
but only time will tell if it's

185
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,013
accessible.

186
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:57,190
So have you on the region here,
a visual politic,

187
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,700
but we would love to know what you 
think.

188
00:09:58,701 --> 00:10:01,940
Do you think these countries will manage
to get rid of their criminal elements?

189
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:03,920
Will the plan is set by Washington 
succeeded?

190
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:07,520
So I'd love to know what you think and 
you can use the comments to you do that.

191
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,590
