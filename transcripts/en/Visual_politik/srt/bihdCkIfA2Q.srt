1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,670
It's the world's largest population,
the second largest economy.

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:14,720
It has one of the largest multicurrency 
reserves,

3
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,900
the second largest military budget,
the number one trade power globally,

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:21,810
but it's better known as the world's 
factory.

5
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,680
These are just a few of the reasons that
China has become a superpower.

6
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:26,573
Now,
if you're a regular viewer of visual 

7
00:00:27,481 --> 00:00:28,314
politic,
you'll know that we've done several 

8
00:00:29,281 --> 00:00:32,340
videos on this country.
We've discussed it's foreign policy,

9
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
it's debt issues.
We've discussed how it's companies have 

10
00:00:35,041 --> 00:00:38,160
grown all around the world as well as 
its political system.

11
00:00:38,161 --> 00:00:41,010
We've discussed the Macau or Hong Kong.
Suffice to say,

12
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:42,250
we've talked a lot about

13
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:43,400
no

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,900
and we have done so because we believe 
that nowadays it is impossible,

15
00:00:51,901 --> 00:00:52,734
but as well as pretty inconvenient to 
discuss international politics without 

16
00:00:56,161 --> 00:00:59,150
keeping in mind this huge global player 
are there.

17
00:00:59,160 --> 00:00:59,993
In all of those previous videos,
you could say that we've skipped a 

18
00:01:01,681 --> 00:01:04,710
really important question and that 
question is really,

19
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:07,260
how powerful is China today?
Well,

20
00:01:07,261 --> 00:01:08,094
the good news is that's exactly the 
question we're going to be answering in 

21
00:01:10,141 --> 00:01:13,290
this video and we're going to do it from
three different perspectives,

22
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,270
military,
economic and political,

23
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,990
and look,
even though many people's date,

24
00:01:16,991 --> 00:01:20,130
think of China as the second most 
important global power.

25
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,710
Not everyone agrees with this,
not at all.

26
00:01:22,711 --> 00:01:23,544
In fact,
some experts believe that when China 

27
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:27,030
potential is carefully examined,
well,

28
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,360
it's not actually all that powerful,
but then again,

29
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,350
there are plenty of other experts.
You stated that Chinese power is growing

30
00:01:34,351 --> 00:01:35,184
at an incredibly fast rate and that the 
21st century is most certainly going to 

31
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:40,260
be China's century.

32
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:41,340
Now,
before we get started,

33
00:01:41,341 --> 00:01:45,690
we should establish one thing first and 
that's what exactly do we mean by power?

34
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:46,553
Is it to have a lot of economic 
resources and what about a big army or 

35
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:51,540
maybe it's actually to do with natural 
resources?

36
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:52,403
Well,
social scientists consider political 

37
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:56,730
power to be found in leverage and 
influence.

38
00:01:56,731 --> 00:01:57,564
That is essentially saying the power is 
the ability to shape and condition the 

39
00:02:01,291 --> 00:02:05,070
events and actions of others.
So the question now becomes,

40
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,933
what is China's power?
What do they have in order to leverage 

41
00:02:08,941 --> 00:02:10,980
and influence other countries?
Well,

42
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:12,930
as I said a moment ago,
in this video,

43
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:13,764
we're going to examine the three main 
areas that most often deliver that 

44
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,900
power,
and that's weapons,

45
00:02:18,990 --> 00:02:21,810
economics and politics bands.
Well,

46
00:02:21,811 --> 00:02:26,811
how about we kick things off with war 
dragons strength?

47
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:33,883
Yeah.
It isn't exactly easy to quantify 

48
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:38,430
anything military strength of a country.
It depends on several different factors.

49
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:40,890
You have to consider how well protected 
the country is.

50
00:02:40,891 --> 00:02:44,220
If its soldiers are well trained on how 
modern it's arsenal is,

51
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,140
as well as a whole bunch of other 
factors.

52
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:48,240
However,
despite these different factors,

53
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:49,074
we can still say the spending on defense
is usually the best way to measure the 

54
00:02:53,490 --> 00:02:54,323
military potential of a nation further.
When we analyze the money a country 

55
00:02:57,391 --> 00:02:58,224
spends on its army,
we also get some other relevant 

56
00:02:59,981 --> 00:03:03,010
information like how important is a 
strong military?

57
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,950
It's the governments.

58
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,330
Sorry.

59
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:09,850
According to the official figures in 
2016,

60
00:03:09,851 --> 00:03:13,960
China spent around $146,000,000,000 on 
defense,

61
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:14,823
but as you can probably imagine,
China's government is not a shiny 

62
00:03:16,991 --> 00:03:19,170
example of transparency in some of the 
sources.

63
00:03:19,171 --> 00:03:24,171
Indicate is that the number could be 
closer to 226 billion anyway,

64
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,123
whichever number is correct.
We do know that China has multiplied 

65
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:28,583
it's defense spending by five in the 
last decade and it is today the second 

66
00:03:32,591 --> 00:03:35,800
largest spending country in the world 
when it comes to defense spending,

67
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,440
trailing only behind the United States.
Of course,

68
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:45,370
five times though it's a significant 
increase in such a short period of time.

69
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,353
However,
this hasn't been disproportionately 

70
00:03:47,501 --> 00:03:51,760
compared to the country's GDP.
Indeed spending has been closely related

71
00:03:51,761 --> 00:03:52,594
to the economic growth of the country 
having been kept within two percent of 

72
00:03:55,631 --> 00:03:58,780
the overall GDP.
That is not the end of it.

73
00:03:58,840 --> 00:03:59,673
If we look at the public budget,
we can see how defense expenses have 

74
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,214
dropped from 12 percent of the public 
spending in 2001 to a listen more than 

75
00:04:07,031 --> 00:04:11,050
six percent in 2016.
And can you guess what that means?

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,913
Well,
it means that China has made less of an 

77
00:04:13,601 --> 00:04:15,820
effort when it comes to spending than 
the US.

78
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:19,270
When you consider GDP and public 
spending as reference points.

79
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:22,030
So take a look at this chart.
For instance,

80
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:30,890
we already know two things.
First,

81
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,250
the Chinese military spending will keep 
growing at the same level of the economy

82
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:35,084
does,
which will gradually shrink that 

83
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:39,800
difference with the US seconds.
We know that military spending is only a

84
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:40,634
small bird into the Chinese economy.
We could say it is a sustainable 

85
00:04:43,491 --> 00:04:44,324
amounts,
and if the government needed to reduce 

86
00:04:45,351 --> 00:04:46,184
it,
the governments could manage to do so 

87
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:49,040
without too many problems.
However,

88
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:49,933
it's now important that we talk about 
military capability because when it 

89
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:55,540
comes to Chinese military power,
rob,

90
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:56,473
certain limitations,
the dragon lacks dryness potential to 

91
00:05:04,301 --> 00:05:05,134
you.
Operate military force outside of their 

92
00:05:05,921 --> 00:05:09,490
borders is actually pretty low.
Unlike the United States,

93
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,500
China does not have any military bases 
abroad,

94
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:14,980
with the exception of Djibouti,
as we will see you later on.

95
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:15,873
It also doesn't have that many allies,
a verb already logistic network or 

96
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:20,013
satellites for launch deployments.
That actually doesn't have much at all 

97
00:05:22,750 --> 00:05:25,150
and then you must consider that there 
are also pretty inexperienced.

98
00:05:25,151 --> 00:05:28,630
I mean it's been 40 years since the last
time Chinese troops engaged in.

99
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:31,830
That's what

100
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,800
does that mean that China is some sort 
of paper tiger?

101
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,880
Well,
no,

102
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:36,773
absolutely not.
New resources are allowing Beijing to 

103
00:05:38,611 --> 00:05:39,444
make important changes and investments.
China's growing military potential has 

104
00:05:43,681 --> 00:05:44,514
changed the balance of forces in Asia 
and the People's Liberation Army is now 

105
00:05:47,521 --> 00:05:50,340
capable of conducting operations on a 
global scale.

106
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,323
China is making changes.
They have reduced their military by 

107
00:05:53,701 --> 00:05:54,534
300,000 soldiers since 2015 and so 
focused on the military upgrades and 

108
00:05:58,521 --> 00:05:59,354
their ability to operate abroad.
The Chinese army opened its first for a 

109
00:06:01,951 --> 00:06:05,990
military base in July of 2017 in the 
African country of Djibouti.

110
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,853
Then in 2012 trying to bolt it's first 
aircraft carrier from Ukraine and in 

111
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:14,900
2017 they completed their first to 
domestic carry up with more to follow is

112
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:19,901
also investing in missiles and it's air 
force has put into service.

113
00:06:20,481 --> 00:06:23,540
It's new generation 20 stealth fighter.
Yes,

114
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,374
it is going to take decades at a minimum
for the Chinese army to come clips to 

115
00:06:27,951 --> 00:06:28,784
the American army,
but there is certainly no other country 

116
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:33,470
out that with as much potential as 
China,

117
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:36,260
we all better get used to having to deal
with China.

118
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:38,870
We're talking about global military 
strategy,

119
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,460
the economic power.
There is no way to sustain any political

120
00:06:48,201 --> 00:06:50,630
or military power without economic 
capacity,

121
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:51,493
but there's more to it than that.
Economic power has its own great 

122
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:55,243
potential to influence other governments
and large companies and this is what is 

123
00:06:58,461 --> 00:06:59,330
happening.
For instance,

124
00:06:59,331 --> 00:07:03,290
with direct foreign investments,
which is both entering and leaving China

125
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:06,650
as a pure financial figure amount.
This is not actually very hydrus yes,

126
00:07:06,651 --> 00:07:10,280
but year after year,
this figure has grown and grown.

127
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,173
In a previous visual politic video we 
looked at is how in the last few years 

128
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:18,760
Chinese companies have started to invest
money around the world in 2016,

129
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:24,043
excluding Hong Kong and Macau.
This amount was more than $180 million 

130
00:07:27,741 --> 00:07:28,790
dollars.
Thanks to this.

131
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:29,653
China is gaining influence,
especially in developing countries that 

132
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:33,990
have seen quite the opportunity in this 
Chinese,

133
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:34,060
yeah,

134
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:39,060
money and just

135
00:07:41,170 --> 00:07:42,003
the same sort of thing with trades,
but he had trying to raise by far the 

136
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:48,580
leading global power and we're not just 
talking about Chinese exports here.

137
00:07:48,581 --> 00:07:49,414
We're talking about imports a lot to pay
attention here because Chinese economic 

138
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:55,340
growth has created a more prosperous 
middle class everyday.

139
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:56,253
More than a hundred and 80,000 people 
leave poverty behind and become a part 

140
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,413
of the middle class that has enough 
money to well spent and it's this view 

141
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:07,930
is something that has caused many 
multinationals to make China.

142
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:08,793
Then number one priority.
That is certainly the case of BMW where 

143
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:17,410
one out of every four cars sold by this 
company is sold in China.

144
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,423
A country where sales and about 50 
percent larger than in the United 

145
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,533
States,
but there's still more Asian assembly 

146
00:08:23,741 --> 00:08:26,050
lines occupying several countries.
For example,

147
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:26,913
Vietnam,
they produce one components while the 

148
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:32,650
another is made in South Korea and later
they are all assembled in China.

149
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:33,613
Vi welds,
great production center in the Asia 

150
00:08:36,190 --> 00:08:40,240
Pacific region to hundreds of thousands 
of jobs depend on trade with China,

151
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:45,820
but not everything looks so good.
There are problems too,

152
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:50,590
especially when it comes to technology,
design and innovation because well,

153
00:08:50,591 --> 00:08:54,490
truth be told,
innovation and creativity usually get on

154
00:08:54,491 --> 00:08:55,324
with dictatorships,
but still things are changing and 

155
00:08:57,871 --> 00:08:58,704
investment trade and multinationals are 
all things that generate a lot of 

156
00:09:01,770 --> 00:09:02,670
influence in

157
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:16,860
growing political power.
That is political power.

158
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:20,330
It's often said that China lacks 
leadership and further,

159
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:23,420
that's like the US,
which counseling solid allies all around

160
00:09:23,421 --> 00:09:26,480
the world.
China is some sort of lone wolf.

161
00:09:26,510 --> 00:09:27,650
Now,
this has been said for years,

162
00:09:27,651 --> 00:09:31,220
but do keep in mind that this is all 
beginning to change.

163
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:32,113
China has bet on increasing their 
influence on global politics and is 

164
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:38,360
doing that to defend interests that are 
increasingly global.

165
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:41,833
Plan a strategy,
the Chinese are using that large 

166
00:09:43,761 --> 00:09:46,400
currency reserves to expand their 
influence.

167
00:09:46,430 --> 00:09:47,263
In the last decade alone,
Beijing has loaned money to several 

168
00:09:49,641 --> 00:09:53,930
governments and has invested all over 
the world from Fiji to Madagascar,

169
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:54,853
and that is not the end of it.
They've also set up ambitious plans to 

170
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:00,350
achieve their goals.
As an example,

171
00:10:00,351 --> 00:10:02,600
the Asian infrastructure investment 
bank,

172
00:10:02,601 --> 00:10:03,434
a financial power controlled by China in
based in Beijing will reduce the 

173
00:10:06,411 --> 00:10:08,840
influence of institutions like the World
Bank,

174
00:10:08,841 --> 00:10:09,674
the IMF or the Asian Development Bank.
All of them controlled by Washington to 

175
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,950
some extent.
And how about some more examples?

176
00:10:15,951 --> 00:10:17,360
Well,
there's the new silk roads,

177
00:10:17,361 --> 00:10:18,680
the one road,
one belt,

178
00:10:18,710 --> 00:10:20,990
the largest infrastructure project in 
the world.

179
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:23,270
Then there is the China Investment 
Corporation,

180
00:10:23,330 --> 00:10:24,163
a sovereign funds that managers more 
than $800,000,000,000 and invests in 

181
00:10:28,041 --> 00:10:30,380
companies all around the world.
And yes,

182
00:10:30,381 --> 00:10:33,440
we didn't make a mistake there.
That is billion with a b.

183
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:34,303
So now you might be wondering,
How's China actually had any political 

184
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:39,350
success with this strategy?
Well,

185
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,213
the answer is yes,
they have and that is well demonstrated 

186
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,270
in the country of Greece.
China is developing enormous projects in

187
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:49,040
this country,
like the portal,

188
00:10:49,070 --> 00:10:51,310
the Hellinikon,
they sort of Monaco in the heart,

189
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,153
the baffin.

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,430
What's the result of all this wild?
Last June,

191
00:10:59,431 --> 00:11:00,264
Athens vetoed a resolution that condemns
the violation of rights in China and 

192
00:11:04,311 --> 00:11:08,100
it's not for the first time anyway.
China is still facing real challenges.

193
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:10,680
Perhaps the biggest of these is it's 
aging population.

194
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,180
I mean,
just have a look at this.

195
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:17,410
Awesome.
Despite

196
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:19,840
this,
the influence of China and international

197
00:11:19,841 --> 00:11:20,674
politics will grow quite a lot in the 
next few years and China is already a 

198
00:11:24,041 --> 00:11:26,950
new superpower as well.
That's our opinion at visual politic and

199
00:11:26,951 --> 00:11:27,784
now we'd love to know yours.
Do you think China is a superpower or 

200
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:30,934
just a flash in the pan and do you think
China should be included in the 

201
00:11:33,671 --> 00:11:35,710
international community to a greater 
extent?

202
00:11:35,830 --> 00:11:36,640
Well,
