1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
This is a special video today we're 
talking about a topic that heavily 

2
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:08,520
affects both this channel and in general
all of Youtube as a platform,

3
00:00:08,521 --> 00:00:11,610
but don't worry,
nobody is shutting down this channel,

4
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:12,444
but maybe those of us who watched from 
the European Union will no longer be 

5
00:00:15,121 --> 00:00:19,320
able to watch some videos yesterday were
talking about article 13,

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:22,650
something you might have heard of it,
especially if you live in Europe because

7
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:26,220
youtube seems to have replaced all of my
youtube ads which were previously.

8
00:00:26,221 --> 00:00:29,610
Would you love a chocolate bar with 
something related to article 13?

9
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:37,700
Now,
let's quickly make one thing clear here.

10
00:00:37,730 --> 00:00:38,563
We definitely biased,
but that's probably not a huge surprise 

11
00:00:42,231 --> 00:00:43,250
to you.
In fact,

12
00:00:43,251 --> 00:00:45,410
we're playing an active role in this 
matter.

13
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,273
One member of the visual holistic team 
was in Brussels recently talking about 

14
00:00:49,371 --> 00:00:53,030
article 13 with policymakers who are 
currently negotiating it.

15
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,893
That by the way,
it would be Fonseca also known as the 

16
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:59,300
drunk Spanish guy doing the voiceovers 
in some of the earlier episodes.

17
00:00:59,301 --> 00:01:00,830
According to some comments.

18
00:01:00,880 --> 00:01:01,940
Yeah.

19
00:01:04,480 --> 00:01:05,313
To this day,
there is an association representing 

20
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:07,743
European online creators.
This is why a group of European Youtube 

21
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:14,200
channels decided to take a bit of an 
initiative and show our concerns,

22
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:17,020
do the relevant politicians,
visual politic.

23
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:19,030
We were one of them,
so for those who don't know,

24
00:01:19,031 --> 00:01:19,864
it's article 13 is part of an EU 
directive which aims to regulate 

25
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:26,800
copyright online,
but the question is now,

26
00:01:26,801 --> 00:01:28,950
well,
what exactly is article 13?

27
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,920
Is it as terrible as everyone is saying 
and most important of all,

28
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,980
what can we content creators do about 
this?

29
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:38,140
Well,
today we're going to answer all of these

30
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:39,490
questions,
but before we do,

31
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,713
as always,
let's take a look back at the history 

32
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,013
for me for the last few years answering 
the what do you do for a living 

33
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:55,100
question?
I kind of got sort of complicated.

34
00:01:55,101 --> 00:01:57,030
Some people,
especially maybe the oldest,

35
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:57,981
they tend to think,
oh,

36
00:01:57,981 --> 00:01:58,814
well that's nice dear,
but you know what you do for actual 

37
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,080
money.
Some of them I've just given up on.

38
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,933
I'm pretty sure that my grandma thinks 
I'm a television presenter here in 

39
00:02:08,121 --> 00:02:08,660
Prague.

40
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:09,493
Okay.

41
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:15,203
But the answer is yes,
I make a living doing this and it's 

42
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:21,120
probably not all that surprising to all 
of you millennials watching.

43
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,090
Now we British,
we don't like talking about money.

44
00:02:24,091 --> 00:02:24,924
Indeed.
Fun factor were seven times more likely 

45
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:27,864
to tell someone we've had an std that we
all to reveal our income to the 

46
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,020
awkwardness.
Let's just take visual politic.

47
00:02:34,021 --> 00:02:36,840
Both the English and the Spanish version
combines.

48
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:40,320
They get about 10 million views a month 
and as you can imagine,

49
00:02:40,321 --> 00:02:42,750
this translates in do something.
You know,

50
00:02:42,751 --> 00:02:45,090
it's a lot of people watching now.
No visual politic.

51
00:02:45,091 --> 00:02:48,810
It doesn't make us millionaires,
but along with the Patriot on donations,

52
00:02:48,811 --> 00:02:50,550
thank you very much.
And the ads,

53
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,010
we can all draw a decent salary and 
look,

54
00:02:53,011 --> 00:02:53,844
we're not the only ones.
There aren't thousands of creators just 

55
00:02:56,821 --> 00:02:59,040
like us all across Europe,
creators,

56
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:02,530
enough of an audience to make an income 
and even create new jobs.

57
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:07,633
And that's only youtube.
It also happens on other platforms like 

58
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,500
instagram and facebook and twitch.
This means that online creators,

59
00:03:13,501 --> 00:03:16,890
we've become an industry.
I mean it's not exactly an oil and gas,

60
00:03:16,891 --> 00:03:17,724
but it does exist.
It's an industry that employs thousands 

61
00:03:20,581 --> 00:03:24,540
of people in Europe and creates value 
for society most of the time.

62
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:27,180
Yes.
Youtube might be an American company,

63
00:03:27,181 --> 00:03:30,300
but the world's biggest youtube.
That's Pewdie Pie I think.

64
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:31,443
Hold on.

65
00:03:34,510 --> 00:03:35,590
Yes,
go Pewdie Pie.

66
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:38,860
He is still beating t series and he's 
Swedish.

67
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:41,560
Alright,
so what exactly is the problem then?

68
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:42,520
Well,
like I said,

69
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,460
there is no association that represents 
US creators,

70
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,823
media corporations in record labels and 
they've got trade associations and 

71
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,080
they've even got big lobbies in 
Brussels.

72
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:58,570
We don't why?
Well,

73
00:03:58,571 --> 00:04:00,790
mainly because we started out little by 
little.

74
00:04:00,791 --> 00:04:03,610
The story behind every youtuber is 
pretty much the same.

75
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,770
You start small,
make a few videos,

76
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:08,890
hopefully you see a bit of growth and 
then suddenly you can be like,

77
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:10,660
oh,
I do this as a job.

78
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,700
And as you can imagine during this 
process,

79
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:14,830
as someone who's been through this 
process,

80
00:04:14,831 --> 00:04:17,110
I haven't.
And I imagine most people don't think at

81
00:04:17,111 --> 00:04:20,260
any point now I should create a trade 
association,

82
00:04:20,261 --> 00:04:21,094
you know,
just in case one day the European Union 

83
00:04:22,781 --> 00:04:25,600
is like,
let's introduce a big old directive that

84
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:26,463
really affects these people.
It's just something that doesn't come 

85
00:04:29,201 --> 00:04:30,034
across on mine.

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:37,440
Alright,
so at this point it's probably important

87
00:04:37,441 --> 00:04:40,620
for you to know exactly how copyright 
works in Europe.

88
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:41,483
Well,
to this day we're under these so called 

89
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,660
ecommerce directive and also the 
copyright directive.

90
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,140
Both of these were passed back in 2001 
so.

91
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,270
Well,
how does this legislation work?

92
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,163
Well,
let's imagine that I upload a video to 

93
00:04:54,661 --> 00:04:57,920
visual politic and I use a video clip 
from a band.

94
00:04:57,921 --> 00:04:58,754
So let's say I upload a song by the band
Tasmania who often provide music for 

95
00:05:02,281 --> 00:05:03,114
this channel,
but let's assume I upload their song 

96
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,083
without permission.
This means I'm actually created 

97
00:05:07,681 --> 00:05:08,514
something illegal Tasmania role.
The record label who holds their rights 

98
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:12,750
can then sue me.

99
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:20,190
This means that essentially they can 
request a big fine from me.

100
00:05:20,191 --> 00:05:22,620
And do they do it well?
Probably not.

101
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,960
I'm a pretty small creator in my 
pockets.

102
00:05:24,990 --> 00:05:28,380
I'll just not that deep so well.
What can Tasmania do?

103
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,273
Well,
they can go to youtube and they can ask 

104
00:05:30,421 --> 00:05:32,330
them to take down the video.
Indeed,

105
00:05:32,340 --> 00:05:33,173
this process is often mostly automatic.
Youtube actually has a tool that small 

106
00:05:36,901 --> 00:05:39,510
filter called content id.
In this case,

107
00:05:39,511 --> 00:05:42,870
Tasmania would send all of the 
information about their on to youtube.

108
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,960
This way youtube can scan the platform 
looking for that song.

109
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,080
Anytime they find it,
they can take down the offending video.

110
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:54,200
This is how the law works.
Well,

111
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:57,410
that's all fine and that's all that 
good,

112
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,220
but just

113
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:01,400
hold on a second because this is where 
the interesting part comes in.

114
00:06:01,550 --> 00:06:03,560
Now it says mania can pretty much ask 
youtube,

115
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,773
hey youtube,
how about instead of just taking that 

116
00:06:06,531 --> 00:06:08,240
video down,
your slice me off a bit,

117
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,480
a sweet sweet revenue pie and send it my
way.

118
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,343
Now according to the letter of the law,
Youtube doesn't have to block the song 

119
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:15,643
if requested,
but the law doesn't say anything about 

120
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,404
paying licenses,
which is essentially what Tasmania 

121
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,410
wants.
Nonetheless,

122
00:06:21,411 --> 00:06:23,120
since youtube is apparently pretty 
chill,

123
00:06:23,121 --> 00:06:26,330
they want to do business with Tasmania,
so they essentially say,

124
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,253
all right,
then what we'll do is we'll negotiate a 

125
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,174
license,
we'll give you a little slice and 

126
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:33,080
everyone's happy.
Sounds good,

127
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:37,220
and otherwise they've negotiated a 
contract and now you might be wondering,

128
00:06:37,221 --> 00:06:38,054
well,
how big is that slice of the revenue 

129
00:06:39,921 --> 00:06:40,754
pie?
Well,

130
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,610
according to the record labels,
it's pretty low.

131
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,440
Just consider what economy.

132
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,763
Some user upload content platforms 
refused to compensate artists and all 

133
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:55,324
music creators fairly for their work.
While they exploited it for their own 

134
00:06:58,721 --> 00:07:01,420
profit.
Sir Paul Mccartney,

135
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:04,060
the question now is,
is Paul Mccartney,

136
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,630
right or wrong?
Youtube states they give to the majority

137
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,464
of the revenue to the record label,
but we don't really know because the 

138
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,380
labels want to keep this information 
confidential.

139
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:17,020
We also don't know because,
well we asked them and nobody would tell

140
00:07:17,021 --> 00:07:19,270
us.
There is one thing we do know though,

141
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,180
the European music associations like 
IFP,

142
00:07:22,181 --> 00:07:25,420
why or impala,
they want youtube to pay more.

143
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,283
They claim there is a so called value 
gap between the Revenue Youtube 

144
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:32,710
generates and what they pay them.
In other words,

145
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:37,180
they want to have a stronger negotiation
position and how can they do that?

146
00:07:37,450 --> 00:07:38,283
Well,
that would be with a new copyright law 

147
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:43,360
that forces platforms like youtube to 
pay a license.

148
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,253
This is why in the year 2016,
the European Commission wrote the first 

149
00:07:47,651 --> 00:07:48,970
draft for this

150
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:51,080
direct

151
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,110
Dev on copyright in the digital single 
market.

152
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:57,873
According to this law,
Youtube and the rest of the user 

153
00:07:59,741 --> 00:08:03,400
generated content platforms,
ms dot compensate fairly to create us.

154
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:04,263
This means that youtube doesn't give 
that added percentage because they're 

155
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:06,973
chill,
but rather because they're legally 

156
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,630
compelled to.
And this is a big deal.

157
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:15,040
This means that the record labels have a
better negotiating position.

158
00:08:15,190 --> 00:08:16,900
Alright,
so so far all of this,

159
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:17,793
it doesn't actually sound that terrible.
So just hold on a moment though because 

160
00:08:21,491 --> 00:08:23,800
this is where things get really 
complicated.

161
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,850
Devil is in the details as you might or 
might not know,

162
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:36,070
the European Commission itself cannot 
pass the law.

163
00:08:36,220 --> 00:08:39,390
They have to send it first to the 
European Parliament and vendor,

164
00:08:39,470 --> 00:08:41,740
the European Council.
These two institutions,

165
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:44,650
they have to write their own versions of
the Lauren.

166
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:48,790
This is where the real issue with 
article 13 comes up.

167
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,333
Online content sharing service providers
perform an act of communication to the 

168
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:58,860
public.
Article Thirteen,

169
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:01,680
paragraph one,
EU parliament vision.

170
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,120
All right,
so now you might be thinking,

171
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:04,050
all right,
Simon,

172
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,120
what is up?
Where exactly is the problem?

173
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,093
What does it mean for you?
I really do need to translate what we 

174
00:09:08,971 --> 00:09:11,790
just heard from the language of the 
European Parliament.

175
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:12,773
It basically means Youtube would have 
unlimited liability on the content that 

176
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:19,670
stays on that platform to illustrate the
impact of this.

177
00:09:19,671 --> 00:09:23,190
Let's go back to Tasmania band example.
Now they couldn't do see me.

178
00:09:23,191 --> 00:09:24,024
They could also sue me and youtube and 
remember that I mentioned the deep 

179
00:09:27,331 --> 00:09:28,164
pockets swell.
Youtube appsolutely has those other 

180
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,390
words.
According to this legislation,

181
00:09:33,391 --> 00:09:35,750
youtube would have to spend millions in 
losses.

182
00:09:40,340 --> 00:09:41,173
Just think about it because there's such
a huge quantity of video going up to 

183
00:09:43,671 --> 00:09:48,671
youtube and need over 300 hours of 
videos are uploaded every minute.

184
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,233
The chances are many of those videos can
have some sort of copyright violation 

185
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:54,793
and youtube just needs to have one video
with a copyright issue to give them a 

186
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,190
potentially multi million dollar legal 
headache.

187
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:04,280
Now obviously youtube cannot deal with 
that kind of legal exposure,

188
00:10:04,281 --> 00:10:07,670
so they have to find a way to avoid it 
and how do they do that?

189
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,040
Well,
they have to build a wall,

190
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:12,530
in this case,
a very strict firewall.

191
00:10:12,590 --> 00:10:16,640
Basically any video with third party 
content would have to be blocked.

192
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,990
Of course,
if you're in America,

193
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:18,824
you could still watch it because this 
law only affects content watched or 

194
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:24,650
uploaded inside Europe.
So if this gets passed,

195
00:10:24,651 --> 00:10:25,484
well,
good luck trying to watch videos inside 

196
00:10:26,871 --> 00:10:27,560
of European.
Yeah,

197
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,393
union

198
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:34,720
and I'm not just talking about people 
who are purposefully violating copyright

199
00:10:34,721 --> 00:10:35,554
here.
I'm talking about most videos because 

200
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:39,340
it's really hard to work out what is and
what.

201
00:10:39,341 --> 00:10:41,830
It's not third party content.
In fact,

202
00:10:41,890 --> 00:10:42,723
it's pretty much almost impossible.
Basically everything just beyond a dude 

203
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:46,504
talking to a camera with a white 
backgrounds would have a risk of being 

204
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,010
blocked and.
Well,

205
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:51,873
that actually includes this video 
because right now I'm going to show you 

206
00:10:54,011 --> 00:10:54,844
a quote from Donald Trump on CNN.
I think you should let me run the 

207
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,420
country.
You run CNN and if you did it well,

208
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,283
your ratings,
if I may ask the question was present 

209
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:05,770
from it and I know what you're going to 
say.

210
00:11:05,771 --> 00:11:06,640
You're probably thinking,
well,

211
00:11:06,670 --> 00:11:08,920
come on son.
You haven't done anything illegal there.

212
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:11,360
I mean that's got to be fair use,
right?

213
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:13,500
And yes,
you're absolutely right.

214
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:14,343
According to the law,
I can use content in this manner for 

215
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:19,270
Satta an illustration,
but you know what?

216
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:20,133
That youtube firewall isn't a lawyer.
It's an algorithm and algorithms don't 

217
00:11:23,231 --> 00:11:26,700
understand content store the law,
so there's brand new youtube far.

218
00:11:26,701 --> 00:11:27,670
Well,
we'll just say whoa.

219
00:11:27,671 --> 00:11:28,504
Third Party content,
block it and last Vance and the same 

220
00:11:30,671 --> 00:11:32,650
goes for when I show you this clip from 
Tasmania.

221
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:39,183
Your

222
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:43,260
is this a legal?
No,

223
00:11:43,290 --> 00:11:48,060
but good luck trying to make a robot 
understands legal caveats and really all

224
00:11:48,061 --> 00:11:48,894
of my youtube creator comrades watching 
this video are going to agree with me 

225
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:55,270
that there are many problems with the 
filters on youtube already.

226
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,104
So imagine how tough it is going to be 
when there's an even more aggressive 

227
00:11:58,181 --> 00:11:59,014
firewall,
but hold on a moment because it's not 

228
00:12:01,061 --> 00:12:03,670
all bad news.
There is an alternative indeed,

229
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:04,533
there is a solution.
It's a solution that makes everybody 

230
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:09,570
moderately happy and that is actually 
pretty realistic.

231
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:16,740
Can it be done about this?
As I told you before,

232
00:12:16,741 --> 00:12:20,220
this copyright directive has been voted 
on in the European parliaments,

233
00:12:20,221 --> 00:12:22,830
but this doesn't mean the legislation 
has been passed.

234
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,200
In fact,
we're still in the middle of it all.

235
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:27,780
You see the process to pass an EU 
directive,

236
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,910
it goes as follows.
First step,

237
00:12:29,911 --> 00:12:32,490
the European Commission creates a first 
draft.

238
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,520
That's how we got the first version of 
article 13.

239
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,470
Second step.
This draft goes to the EU parliament.

240
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,190
They write another draft and they vote 
on it.

241
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:44,250
This is why we have another version of 
article 13,

242
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:45,143
but now there is a third step and a 
third player coming in and that's the 

243
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:49,810
European Council.

244
00:12:49,810 --> 00:12:50,643
So

245
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,933
the European Council is where all of the
member states are represented and Oh 

246
00:12:57,551 --> 00:12:58,384
yes,
they have approved another veteran of 

247
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:01,570
article 13,
so yes,

248
00:13:01,571 --> 00:13:04,290
dear view is we don't just have what our
for 13,

249
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,250
we actually have three different 
versions.

250
00:13:06,251 --> 00:13:07,580
One from the commission,
Waterford,

251
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,433
the parliament and one from the council.
European political institutions are so 

252
00:13:12,491 --> 00:13:15,250
simple,
said no one ever so.

253
00:13:15,251 --> 00:13:16,360
Well.
What happens next?

254
00:13:16,361 --> 00:13:18,460
Well,
now we are in the third step,

255
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:20,740
which is when the condition,
the parliaments and the council,

256
00:13:20,741 --> 00:13:24,130
they get together and they negotiate in 
Brussels speak.

257
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:26,410
This is cooled of the trial logs

258
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:33,260
and yes,
that is sort of a dialogue,

259
00:13:33,261 --> 00:13:35,060
but with three people,
like I said,

260
00:13:35,061 --> 00:13:38,690
things are never simple in Brussels.
Even the words they use,

261
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:41,960
so let's imagine a big room with a big 
round table.

262
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:42,794
On the one hand we have the commission 
representative and our advisors on the 

263
00:13:45,381 --> 00:13:46,214
other.
We have the representative of the 

264
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:47,714
parliaments and on the other we have the
one from the council counseling all of 

265
00:13:50,721 --> 00:13:54,410
the representatives and advisors.
We have over 30 people negotiating.

266
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,590
They meet almost every week and you 
better believe me,

267
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:02,000
it is a long process which probably 
doesn't surprise you.

268
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:04,400
In this case we have three different 
texts and believe me,

269
00:14:04,401 --> 00:14:06,830
the one from the council is very 
different.

270
00:14:12,620 --> 00:14:13,453
The absence of the authorization and 
online content sharing provider shall 

271
00:14:17,601 --> 00:14:18,434
not be liable for the acts of the 
communication to the public when it 

272
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:22,964
demonstrates that it has made its best 
efforts and upon notification by rights 

273
00:14:27,951 --> 00:14:32,600
holders,
it has acted expedia mostly to remove or

274
00:14:32,601 --> 00:14:36,260
disable access to these works.
Article 13,

275
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,250
paragraph four.

276
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:39,420
All right.
Let me translate that for you.

277
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,560
This means that youtube is liable for 
the content on their platform,

278
00:14:43,590 --> 00:14:46,950
but the liability is missing.
Jesus still,

279
00:14:46,951 --> 00:14:48,900
we might need to clarify what that 
means,

280
00:14:48,901 --> 00:14:50,880
so let's get back to the Tasmania.
For example,

281
00:14:50,910 --> 00:14:51,743
with this new lauren hand,
Youtube must report to them the songs 

282
00:14:54,021 --> 00:14:54,854
that are uploaded on the platform and 
they have to ask them whether they want 

283
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:59,780
to take the video down or get a license 
from it.

284
00:14:59,900 --> 00:15:03,020
At this moment,
Tasmania will have to add their data and

285
00:15:03,050 --> 00:15:05,330
metadata into a form.
This way,

286
00:15:05,331 --> 00:15:06,164
that filter youtube already has these so
called content ID system already knows 

287
00:15:10,041 --> 00:15:11,900
what to track,
but not only that,

288
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:12,763
according to this article 13 version,
if youtube shows they have done 

289
00:15:15,291 --> 00:15:17,510
everything possible to protect the 
copyright,

290
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:22,720
they cannot be sued.
In other words,

291
00:15:25,271 --> 00:15:26,104
if youtube plays by the rules,
they can avoid a lot of legal 

292
00:15:29,051 --> 00:15:30,310
uncertainty.
Now,

293
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:32,050
yes,
they would have to pay more money to the

294
00:15:32,051 --> 00:15:35,440
record labels,
but there's no existential risk anymore,

295
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:36,393
and of course we.
Their content creators would also be 

296
00:15:38,051 --> 00:15:41,620
happy to because we didn't have to worry
about all of our videos being blocked.

297
00:15:41,710 --> 00:15:42,670
And finally,
of course,

298
00:15:42,671 --> 00:15:45,670
the record labels are happy as well 
because they get what they need.

299
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,770
Better conditions for negotiating.

300
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,203
So let me quickly summarize for you 
what's the difference between the 

301
00:15:55,141 --> 00:15:55,974
parliament and the council positions?
The consequences of the parliaments of 

302
00:15:58,711 --> 00:16:02,340
Ashton is that European youtube would 
just become another TV channel.

303
00:16:02,341 --> 00:16:05,100
One of the creators you already have a 
big audience would survive.

304
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,993
Why?
Because they're the only ones you can 

305
00:16:06,721 --> 00:16:09,990
pay a lawyer to manage all of the 
copyright issue so that Youtube will let

306
00:16:09,991 --> 00:16:10,824
them upload videos,
but there's going to be a pretty big 

307
00:16:13,170 --> 00:16:14,003
pool and it's going to be pretty 
impossible to surpass for the hundreds 

308
00:16:17,490 --> 00:16:18,323
of thousands of small creators,
but there is a way to find a common 

309
00:16:21,901 --> 00:16:22,734
ground for all of the players here,
and of course it's compromise and 

310
00:16:25,891 --> 00:16:28,320
compromise.
That's what politics is all about.

311
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,180
So now the big question is,
well,

312
00:16:30,181 --> 00:16:33,480
what comes after this step?
What is the fourth step here?

313
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:34,463
While officer,
this legislation has been negotiated by 

314
00:16:35,911 --> 00:16:36,744
the trial logs.

315
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:40,950
They bring it back to the parliaments 
that they vote yes or no on the text and

316
00:16:40,951 --> 00:16:44,970
then we go to the final step.
And this is an EU directive.

317
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:47,610
Now an EU directive is not actually a 
law,

318
00:16:47,611 --> 00:16:50,640
but it's rather a guideline.
So after the director of gets passed,

319
00:16:50,641 --> 00:16:54,720
it has to go to all of the member states
where they turn it international laws,

320
00:16:54,810 --> 00:16:55,643
and this is another moment where online 
creators have to show up and speak to 

321
00:16:58,111 --> 00:16:59,960
their national governments.
And yes,

322
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,640
if you're a European youtube creator 
watching this right now,

323
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:03,863
that includes you.
So if there's one thing that we learned 

324
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:08,340
from our trip to Brussels is kind of the
policymakers,

325
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,233
they don't even know you exist,
and if they don't know about us as an 

326
00:17:11,821 --> 00:17:12,654
industry,
if they don't know that thousands of 

327
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:18,090
people live off creating content online,
they will not understand how many people

328
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:21,180
might get unemployed because of a bad 
regulation.

329
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:22,043
So if you liked this video,
rather than asking you to subscribe 

330
00:17:23,851 --> 00:17:24,684
today,
I suggest that you share it with a 

331
00:17:25,471 --> 00:17:26,304
friend as a creator of Fanny European,
hopefully someone who will help make a 

332
00:17:29,461 --> 00:17:31,290
difference.
Now at some point in the future,

333
00:17:31,291 --> 00:17:33,030
we're probably going to need to act on 
this.

334
00:17:33,031 --> 00:17:36,690
And here are visual politic.
We're going to keep you posted and thank

335
00:17:36,691 --> 00:17:37,524
you for watching.
And if you've enjoyed hearing my lovely 

336
00:17:39,331 --> 00:17:40,164
voice,
consider checking out the dreams around 

337
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,144
the world youtube channel for more on 
travel psychology and personal 

338
00:17:45,031 --> 00:17:45,864
development.
