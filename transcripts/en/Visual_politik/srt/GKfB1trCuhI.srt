1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:11,400
have you ever asked yourself,
which is the best countries live in?

3
00:00:11,430 --> 00:00:12,263
Well,
when we want to know which country that 

4
00:00:13,201 --> 00:00:15,090
is,
we usually tend to look at the country's

5
00:00:15,091 --> 00:00:15,924
GDP,
but however important and relevant this 

6
00:00:18,421 --> 00:00:21,450
indicator might be,
it does have certain limitations.

7
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,250
See this statistic is too wide and it 
can hide the influence of bubbles,

8
00:00:26,290 --> 00:00:27,123
the actions of dishonest politicians and
is more complex issues like accounting 

9
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:31,404
for the online economy.
It is true though that wealth and 

10
00:00:33,301 --> 00:00:37,830
comfort are closely related to the GDP,
but it is not an exact correlation.

11
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:40,380
Let me explain.
We could be analyzing a country that has

12
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:41,214
a higher GDP per capita than another,
but the last occurs have a better 

13
00:00:44,251 --> 00:00:45,084
welfare system despite having that lower
GDP and there are also other factors to 

14
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:51,054
consider that not strictly economic but 
also affects the social wellbeing of 

15
00:00:54,211 --> 00:00:56,800
people of such as security and freedom.
All right.

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:00:57,643
All right,
so probably know something you thinking 

17
00:00:58,561 --> 00:00:59,394
right now and that's that.
Well do these things or result from 

18
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:03,070
having a higher GDP anyway?
Well,

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,170
yeah,
they kind of do,

20
00:01:04,171 --> 00:01:05,004
but it usually takes awhile before any 
of this can be seen in terms of numbers 

21
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:09,960
and statistics.
For instance,

22
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:13,350
if you look at Kuwait GDP per capita,
it's definitely higher than Germany's.

23
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,453
If given the choice,
most people would probably rather live 

24
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:17,124
in the latter.

25
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,250
It's also more likely that Germany is 
going to be involved in complex and high

26
00:01:23,251 --> 00:01:27,150
added value activities like creating 
patents and innovative companies.

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,220
In other words,
[inaudible] it might become richer,

28
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:33,030
but at the same time Germany might be 
taking better advantage of its wealth in

29
00:01:33,031 --> 00:01:35,280
order to produce welfare,
sustainable wealth,

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,173
technology and knowledge and most people
would regard doing that as a pretty 

31
00:01:39,511 --> 00:01:41,940
sensible decision and this whole 
complicated thing.

32
00:01:41,941 --> 00:01:42,774
That's why they're on new indicators to 
try to make a more accurate 

33
00:01:45,511 --> 00:01:49,590
approximation so that we can work out 
the prosperity and comforts of different

34
00:01:49,591 --> 00:01:50,424
nations.
One of them is the famous [inaudible] 

35
00:01:51,501 --> 00:01:52,334
gotten prosperity index.
National success is about far more than 

36
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:58,260
just GDP.
It is about a healthy and happy life,

37
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,590
a good education for our children,
a clean and protected environment,

38
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,513
family and communities.
We can rely on a safe place to live up 

39
00:02:05,101 --> 00:02:07,200
to unity's,
to start a business or get ahead and the

40
00:02:07,201 --> 00:02:10,260
freedom to be who we want to be.
This is true prosperity.

41
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,020
And you know what's,
at least according to these rankings,

42
00:02:13,021 --> 00:02:16,140
the most prosperous nation on earth is,
well,

43
00:02:16,141 --> 00:02:21,141
that would be New Zealand's most 
prosperous country.

44
00:02:26,670 --> 00:02:27,210
Yeah.

45
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:28,043
Trying to get a deeper knowledge of the 
prosperity of the country beyond the 

46
00:02:30,631 --> 00:02:31,464
GDP.
The GOSSAN prosperity index considers 

47
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:35,190
tons of different factors,
economics,

48
00:02:35,191 --> 00:02:36,330
business,
civil liberties,

49
00:02:36,331 --> 00:02:38,700
government education environments.
Honestly,

50
00:02:38,701 --> 00:02:41,700
every aspects that accounts for quality 
of life in a country.

51
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:44,010
So in the latest ranking,
the results,

52
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,930
it was pretty clear.
Nowadays,

53
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:46,793
New Zealand's the land of the Kiwi is 
the most prosperous country on the 

54
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:53,130
planet as honestly,
this wasn't really much of a surprise.

55
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,240
And He Zealand's has taken this position
six times in the last 10 years.

56
00:02:57,270 --> 00:02:58,260
Not Bad.
Right.

57
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:02,613
And now you might be wondering,
which are the countries New Zealand is 

58
00:03:04,771 --> 00:03:07,980
competing with in order to win the crown
of the best country on earth.

59
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,870
Well,
you wouldn't be surprised to find at the

60
00:03:09,871 --> 00:03:11,880
top of the list countries like Norway,
Finland,

61
00:03:11,881 --> 00:03:14,160
Switzerland,
Canada or Australia,

62
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:17,340
it's pretty tough competition.
I should also mention at this point that

63
00:03:17,341 --> 00:03:21,270
soon enough we're going to be explaining
on this channel how New Zealand achieved

64
00:03:21,271 --> 00:03:24,750
so much of this after so much crisis.
If you want to catch that video,

65
00:03:24,751 --> 00:03:26,940
be sure to subscribe to this channel,
but for now,

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,840
let's move on.
Now,

67
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:30,860
if you think New Zealand is just ranks 
number one for this indicator,

68
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,250
well you couldn't be more wrong if we 
consider the doing business ranking.

69
00:03:35,251 --> 00:03:36,840
For instance,
this is a ranking by the way,

70
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:37,674
that classifies countries according to 
how easy it is to set up a company and 

71
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:40,560
do business.

72
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,393
We can see that New Zealand is also in 
the number one spot in the latest 

73
00:03:44,611 --> 00:03:49,590
ranking New Zealand dethrone Singapore 
as easiest place to do business.

74
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,860
If we use the index of economic freedom 
from the Heritage Foundation,

75
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:53,723
we will see that New Zealand is in third
position right after a Singapore and 

76
00:03:56,970 --> 00:03:59,780
Hong Kong.
Then if we use the ranking of the Fraser

77
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,613
Institute,
a ranking that considers both economic 

78
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:02,424
and civil freedoms.
New Zealand's is also in the top three 

79
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:08,250
just behind Hong Kong and Switzerlands 
and if this is not enough for you as you

80
00:04:08,251 --> 00:04:09,084
want more specific information,
I can also tell you that New Zealand is 

81
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:15,330
the least corrupt country on earth 
according to Transparency International.

82
00:04:15,331 --> 00:04:17,820
This is a position that it shares with 
Denmark.

83
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:19,660
Yes.
Unlike other countries that we happen to

84
00:04:19,661 --> 00:04:20,494
know very well,
it is very uncommon for this country's 

85
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,050
government to have their hands in the 
till.

86
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:27,840
Furthermore,
this is also one of the safest countries

87
00:04:27,841 --> 00:04:28,674
in the wells as well as being one of the
most environmentally friendly and it 

88
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,274
also has the all blacks,
the best national rugby team on the 

89
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,274
planet.

90
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,113
Oh,

91
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:43,970
but let's move on from the rankings 
because honestly we could go on forever.

92
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,070
They do seem to make one thing clear 
though,

93
00:04:46,071 --> 00:04:46,904
and that is that on paper New Zealand,
it sure does look like one of the best 

94
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:51,200
places in the world to live.

95
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:53,870
Okay.

96
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:56,180
By the way.
Here is a surprising fact about alto.

97
00:04:56,181 --> 00:04:57,710
Rob,
as it said in Maori,

98
00:04:57,711 --> 00:04:58,544
which is an official language that the 
New Zealand is a really proud of the 

99
00:05:01,011 --> 00:05:01,844
Maori culture and it's the integration 
of these Polynesian people that the 

100
00:05:04,401 --> 00:05:06,410
British pounds when they arrived on 
these islands,

101
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:09,940
it is true no matter where you go,
the Maori culture is present.

102
00:05:10,980 --> 00:05:11,813
Okay.

103
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:13,670
All right,
so moving on,

104
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,713
on the 23rd of September,
2017 elections took place in this 

105
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:18,854
country.

106
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:22,473
Okay,

107
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,730
a record election.

108
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:26,823
The first thing we need to remember is 
that New Zealand is a constitutional 

109
00:05:29,261 --> 00:05:30,160
monarchy.
That's right,

110
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,073
Elizabeth.
The second is still the queen of this 

111
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:32,944
country,
but it's really just a symbolic 

112
00:05:34,271 --> 00:05:37,120
position.
God Save the Queen in New Zealand,

113
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:37,954
the government is elected by the 
parliaments and the term it lasts for 

114
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,470
three years.
Further,

115
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,470
when New Zealand is go to vote,
they have to vote twice.

116
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,920
One of the votes goes to a single 
candidates from one political party.

117
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,890
This will complete eight parts of the 
parliaments.

118
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,840
The other vote goes to an NP who will 
represent their districts.

119
00:05:52,870 --> 00:05:53,703
So as we sat on the 23rd of September,
New Zealand's a held an election and it 

120
00:05:56,531 --> 00:06:00,080
was a clear for the National Party of 
Bill English.

121
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,630
Bill English already was the prime 
minister by the way,

122
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,464
since the resignation of Junky in 
December of 2016 we also going to talk 

123
00:06:13,251 --> 00:06:15,380
about this former prime minister in an 
upcoming video.

124
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:17,510
So again,
please do hit that subscribe button.

125
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,930
So this victory for the national posse,
well it was historic in a way,

126
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:21,823
and this was for two reasons.
First because this party had never got 

127
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:24,944
so many votes in an election and seconds
because if the new government is 

128
00:06:27,831 --> 00:06:28,664
confirmed for the National Party would 
have been in power since 2008 for the 

129
00:06:31,611 --> 00:06:36,350
longest period in office for a party in 
New Zealand for more than 50 years.

130
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,273
And truth be told,
there are plenty of reasons why bill 

131
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:42,470
English one as we have seen,
the country is in great shape.

132
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,453
In fact,
it is going through one of the best 

133
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:47,180
moments in its history.
The economy is growing,

134
00:06:47,181 --> 00:06:51,750
unemployment is higher than the average 
and the unemployment is pretty scarce.

135
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:53,970
Plus they also have healthy public 
finances.

136
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:58,020
Mr. English is eight years.
His finance minister,

137
00:06:58,110 --> 00:06:58,943
unemployment fell.
The budget return to a surplus and New 

138
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:04,440
Zealand enjoyed one of the highest 
growth rates in the developed world.

139
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,333
The National Party's intention is to 
continue with the politics that they've 

140
00:07:07,291 --> 00:07:08,124
carried out since 2008 and that's more 
trade balanced budgets and also trying 

141
00:07:11,731 --> 00:07:13,740
to keep immigration rates higher than 
ever.

142
00:07:13,770 --> 00:07:16,800
This has actually been a very important 
aspect of their political campaign.

143
00:07:16,801 --> 00:07:17,940
I mean,
if it's not broken,

144
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:18,774
don't fix it.
181,000 jobs have been created in the 

145
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:26,580
last two years and the average annual 
wage is up $13,000 under national.

146
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,473
Someone working on the minimum wage has 
seen their annual income go up $8,000 

147
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:33,870
since 2008 Bill English.
Despite this,

148
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,020
all the campaign hasn't been as 
comfortable as some expected.

149
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,180
After all,
even in the most prosperous country,

150
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,730
there are challenges and unresolved 
issues.

151
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,110
Mamia and challenges

152
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:53,400
just into done was elected leader of the
Labour Party policy.

153
00:07:53,401 --> 00:07:55,560
It wasn't exactly going through its best
moments.

154
00:07:55,590 --> 00:08:00,420
In the elections of 2014 the Labour 
party barely gone to 25% of the vote,

155
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:02,940
about half the votes of Junkies National
Party.

156
00:08:02,970 --> 00:08:03,803
However,
shortly after they choose a new leader 

157
00:08:05,071 --> 00:08:07,050
who was only 37 years old.
Well,

158
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,360
things that things started to change,
the press,

159
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,280
they call this just sinned.
A mania.

160
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,833
Two things have been the keys of 
Jacinta's campaign housing and 

161
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,613
immigration.
You see one of the problems in New 

162
00:08:18,210 --> 00:08:19,043
Zealand is the price of houses.
Something that has skyrocketed in the 

163
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:22,673
last few years.
The price of housing has increased much 

164
00:08:23,911 --> 00:08:26,880
more than in Australia or Canada or the 
United States.

165
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,960
New Zealand to tops world house price 
increase,

166
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,960
but why is the price of housing growing 
quite so much?

167
00:08:33,990 --> 00:08:35,250
Well,
that's for several reasons,

168
00:08:35,251 --> 00:08:38,130
but there are three main causes.
First,

169
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,890
economy and salaries are increasing a 
lot in New Zealand.

170
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,930
Second's immigration rates are higher 
than ever.

171
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:43,823
This is one of the countries that 
receives the most immigrants every year 

172
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,940
relative to their population and it's 
more immigrants.

173
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,050
That means the greater demand.

174
00:08:49,190 --> 00:08:50,023
How's it?

175
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,990
Because many millionaires investors,
especially from Asia but also from other

176
00:08:57,991 --> 00:08:58,824
parts of the world.
Once a buy houses here to put their 

177
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:03,060
money in a safe place and also to enjoy 
the country.

178
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:05,250
One example of these people would be 
Jack Mar,

179
00:09:05,251 --> 00:09:07,770
the CEO of Alibaba does the National 
Party.

180
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,430
They wanted to tackle this issue by 
making construction easy and fast.

181
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,790
The Labor Party have just Endura done 
came up with two suggestions.

182
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,683
First,
reducing the number of immigrants by 

183
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:17,664
half and second is preventing foreign 
investors from buying houses in New 

184
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,073
Zealand.
It was this speech on Housing and 

185
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,610
immigration that got him the support of 
the Party and Poles.

186
00:09:28,611 --> 00:09:31,850
It seemed to indicate that at times it 
was a very close race,

187
00:09:31,851 --> 00:09:33,890
but once the election's arrived,
the Kiwis,

188
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,450
well they did not hesitate.

189
00:09:39,290 --> 00:09:39,900
Okay,

190
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:41,130
let's be clear.
New Zealand,

191
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,993
it's a great country,
but it does have some obstacles to 

192
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:44,544
overcome housing and proving Mallory 
integration and technical education are 

193
00:09:47,641 --> 00:09:50,010
a few of these things,
but in the grand scheme of things,

194
00:09:50,011 --> 00:09:52,560
they're pretty small problems.
Now we're going to discuss some of these

195
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:54,030
problems in a future video,
but for now,

196
00:09:54,031 --> 00:09:54,864
New Zealanders,
they can enjoy some of the best living 

197
00:09:56,401 --> 00:09:58,860
standards in the wells anyway.
Now it's your turn.

198
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,950
We'd love to know what you think.
Would you like to spend some time in New

199
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,783
Zealand?
What do you think of the country as a 

200
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:03,601
whole?
