1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,233
In the last few years,
Chile has become the Christiana Renaldo 

2
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:12,243
last in America.
It was the country with the highest 

3
00:00:14,071 --> 00:00:14,904
growth,
had the most success and sticking with 

4
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,394
our metaphor here,
it scored the most goals also for many 

5
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:20,634
classical liberals,
Chile has been the benchmark for years 

6
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:24,293
we can say they considered the Chilean 
models something of a dream in a world 

7
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,860
full of dark nightmares,

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:35,473
and it was true.
There were good reasons for celebration 

9
00:00:36,890 --> 00:00:37,723
Chile,
which ones was the poorest Spanish 

10
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,930
country in Latin America became the 
richest in the region.

11
00:00:41,931 --> 00:00:42,764
It became the country with the highest 
life expectancy in the country with the 

12
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,600
best social services in the entire 
region.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:50,270
It is true that inequality is very high 
in Chile,

14
00:00:50,271 --> 00:00:51,104
but the entire population of Chile has 
benefited from the prosperity that the 

15
00:00:53,901 --> 00:00:56,750
country has achieved over the past few 
decades.

16
00:00:57,310 --> 00:00:58,143
For the past 25 years,
the income of the poorest people in the 

17
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:04,310
country has increased far more than the 
income of the wealthiest people as their

18
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:07,410
purchasing power has grown six times 
larger.

19
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:11,930
All of this compares very favorably to 
other Latin American nations.

20
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:13,610
As an example,
in 1950,

21
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:14,444
the average income was around a third of
Venezuelan income in a manner of 

22
00:01:18,111 --> 00:01:20,870
speaking and Venezuelans were three 
times richer.

23
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:21,763
A lot has changed since then and today.
Chileans are much richer than 

24
00:01:25,161 --> 00:01:28,460
Venezuelans.
They also have a longer life expectancy,

25
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:32,660
hla and lives in average of eight years,
more than a person born in Venezuela.

26
00:01:36,230 --> 00:01:36,990
Okay.

27
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:41,460
Comparing Chile to Venezuela or 
Argentina shore makes Chilean look good,

28
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:44,640
but when the comparison is made with 
other more distant countries,

29
00:01:44,641 --> 00:01:46,170
for example,
those in Asia,

30
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:49,320
the figures aren't nearly so nice and 
further.

31
00:01:49,321 --> 00:01:51,510
It seems as if the country has stopped 
growing,

32
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,850
which is certainly well,

33
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,753
yes,

34
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,520
the Chilean slow down

35
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:03,500
last few years.
The optimism and success,

36
00:02:03,501 --> 00:02:05,570
well,
it's come to an end in San Diego,

37
00:02:05,571 --> 00:02:08,810
the capital of the country,
the displays of wealth and prosperity of

38
00:02:08,811 --> 00:02:12,620
left making room instead for 
demonstrations and protests,

39
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,470
anger and despair have taken over and 
well,

40
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:16,393
it's only logical economic growth has 
fallen for the last few years and in 

41
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:22,484
2016,
unemployment increased while salaries 

42
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,270
remains frozen.
Further,

43
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,133
the youth can't find jobs in both 
investment and exports have fallen and 

44
00:02:30,201 --> 00:02:31,034
the thing is that things aren't looking 
like they're going to get any better 

45
00:02:33,411 --> 00:02:34,244
anytime soon.

46
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:39,520
Twenty 16,
the Chilean economy grew by one point,

47
00:02:39,521 --> 00:02:40,354
five percent.
Truly central banks forecast for 2017 

48
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:43,803
are not a whole lot better.
Increasing to two percent from one 

49
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:47,314
percent.

50
00:02:48,170 --> 00:02:50,130
Just want me to all of the growth of the
last decades.

51
00:02:50,131 --> 00:02:54,120
Three out of every four Chileans make 
less than $700 a month,

52
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:56,430
so now you can probably understand their
anger.

53
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:59,160
These aren't the salaries that belonged 
to a rich country,

54
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
so all in all,
the Chilean model seems to be failing 

55
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:04,510
and there is one person who is 
responsible for this slow down.

56
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:07,690
And that's Miquel Baca.
That's the current president of Chile.

57
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:15,320
Evolution of Bachelot Michelle

58
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:17,360
backlash was the president of Chile for 
March,

59
00:03:17,361 --> 00:03:19,550
2016,
March 2010,

60
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:23,420
but essentially a president can be 
elected to two consecutive terms,

61
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:24,283
so bankers have to wait four years 
before she could run again for Lamanita 

62
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,930
the name of the presidential palace in 
Chile.

63
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,793
Well,
after gaining the support of almost all 

64
00:03:32,061 --> 00:03:32,894
the left wing parties,
including the Socialist Party and the 

65
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:36,463
Communist Party,
won the elections in November of 2013 

66
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,810
and a few months later,
I'd been march of 2014,

67
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,150
she became the president of the Republic
of Chile again

68
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:48,123
in the second time back,
let decided to go through with reforms 

69
00:03:50,291 --> 00:03:51,124
which were much more aggressive than the
ones she came up with at the time 

70
00:03:53,531 --> 00:03:54,364
around.
Her first decision was to increase 

71
00:03:55,751 --> 00:03:58,870
taxation on companies by almost 40 
percent.

72
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,733
Quite a dramatic move.
He did it by raising rates on profits 

73
00:04:02,381 --> 00:04:03,214
and also by eliminating a bonus,
which means companies could reduce 

74
00:04:05,891 --> 00:04:09,020
taxation if the profits were reinvested 
in Chile.

75
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,420
Think about it.
That was all about reinvestment,

76
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:15,910
was actually a really reasonable 
incentive.

77
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,250
A country like China,
which is far from being rich,

78
00:04:18,251 --> 00:04:19,870
needs factories,
machines,

79
00:04:19,871 --> 00:04:22,180
businesses,
technology and investments,

80
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:25,660
and this incentive encouraged the growth
of all of these things.

81
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,480
So the question is,
what's the point of publishing companies

82
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,314
providing this much needed investments?
And in addition to all of this taxation 

83
00:04:32,321 --> 00:04:34,660
on companies wasn't exactly low.
To begin with,

84
00:04:34,690 --> 00:04:35,523
take a look at how things are now off 
tobacco that has punished these 

85
00:04:37,811 --> 00:04:38,644
companies.

86
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,563
Chile has the second highest corporate 
taxes in the world surpassed only by 

87
00:04:43,351 --> 00:04:44,184
Japan,
a much richer country with much larger 

88
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:47,274
companies,

89
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:49,830
and would you like to know the 
consequences of this measure?

90
00:04:49,870 --> 00:04:50,703
Well,
investment has fallen by 30 percent 

91
00:04:52,330 --> 00:04:55,630
since backer lead came back to the 
presidential palace and of course,

92
00:04:55,640 --> 00:05:00,190
less investment means ness job's less 
growth and therefore less tax revenue.

93
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:03,190
In other words,
they decided to eat the cake before they

94
00:05:03,191 --> 00:05:06,490
could even bake us and weld.
That rarely works.

95
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:07,383
That is why there has been a clear 
international tendency to reduce 

96
00:05:09,971 --> 00:05:12,940
taxation on companies over the last few 
years.

97
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,293
Canada,
the UK and Ireland are some examples of 

98
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,580
countries where corporate taxes has been
reduced.

99
00:05:21,790 --> 00:05:24,220
The new president of France,
Emmanuel Macron,

100
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,770
has also promised to reduce taxes

101
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:28,521
well,
surely.

102
00:05:28,521 --> 00:05:30,350
Well,
it's headed in the opposite direction,

103
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:33,980
but do wait a second here because well,
that's not the other two main reforms.

104
00:05:33,981 --> 00:05:34,814
Bachelors is put through.
You have resulted in a very similar 

105
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,233
outcome.
Labor reform as made recruitment more 

106
00:05:39,861 --> 00:05:43,130
expensive and has given more power to 
trade unions.

107
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,750
Some,
I liked the sounds of this,

108
00:05:44,751 --> 00:05:45,584
but it means more costs for companies 
which when added to the increase on 

109
00:05:48,171 --> 00:05:50,760
taxation means there is even less 
investments,

110
00:05:50,761 --> 00:05:53,510
less competition and less exports.
Essentially.

111
00:05:53,511 --> 00:05:55,790
All of this has caused,
well the whole lot of problems.

112
00:05:55,791 --> 00:05:56,624
On the other hand,
tobacco ads tried to pass an ambitious 

113
00:05:58,101 --> 00:05:58,934
reform.
Do you turn the private college 

114
00:05:59,721 --> 00:06:03,050
education system into a public free of 
charge service?

115
00:06:03,051 --> 00:06:05,030
The problem is the visual politic view 
of that.

116
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:05,864
This model is very expensive and some 
say the solution to the problems of 

117
00:06:08,871 --> 00:06:09,704
education is to improve the quality of 
the universities themselves instead of 

118
00:06:12,951 --> 00:06:15,320
making them into factories,
printing deployments.

119
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:16,183
But anyway,
the thing is back in that couldn't pass 

120
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,284
this reform and in her attempt to do so,
she turns the whole education system 

121
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:23,090
upside down.
For example,

122
00:06:23,091 --> 00:06:26,570
she has reduced the amount of investment
that was plans to improve the quality of

123
00:06:26,571 --> 00:06:28,280
these universities,
but okay,

124
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:29,870
well now you might be wondering,
well,

125
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:32,600
what are the citizens of Chile?
Think about all of this.

126
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,160
Well,
that's look closely.

127
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:36,843
Percent of Chileans believe that 
Michelle Bachelet government must delay 

128
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,013
or at least moderate some of the reforms
that have recently taken place in the 

129
00:06:44,411 --> 00:06:46,540
country,
especially educational reform.

130
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:53,030
It feels as if I was working towards an 
ideological change rather than a formula

131
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,520
which could actually sold national 
problems.

132
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,793
In fact,
all these reforms and the hostility 

133
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:01,654
towards private corporations have led to
Chile to suffer the worst economic 

134
00:07:04,451 --> 00:07:05,284
period for decades as well.
Do you know who is most negatively 

135
00:07:08,081 --> 00:07:09,880
affected by the situation?
Well,

136
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:10,743
that's the poor and the working class 
after all the wealthy already have a 

137
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:14,500
good standard of living.

138
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,220
Okay.

139
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:20,770
The thing is,
backlit leaves the country with a crisis

140
00:07:20,771 --> 00:07:21,604
with the growing public deficit,
with the highest public spending of the 

141
00:07:23,651 --> 00:07:26,740
last 26 years,
and frankly with the damage to economy.

142
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,290
But now that you know all of this,
you might be wondering,

143
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,390
well,
besides backlash,

144
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,070
one of the biggest weaknesses in Chile.
Well,

145
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:33,933
let's have a look.

146
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,430
Chili's.
Weaknesses,

147
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:42,343
yes.

148
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:47,000
The shelly doesn't like foreign 
professionals.

149
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,863
It's a bit strange for a country like 
Chile because they seem to have been 

150
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:52,610
incapable of attracting foreign 
professionals.

151
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:55,700
Immigration is only two percent,
and while that's a problem,

152
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:58,630
because it affects entrepreneurship,
innovation and trait,

153
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:03,320
why won't Chili grow?
Because it is full of Chileans.

154
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,390
Ricardo Hausmann,
director of the Center for International

155
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:08,500
Development of Harvard University.

156
00:08:08,500 --> 00:08:09,333
Generally speaking,
foreign professionals tend to be more 

157
00:08:11,051 --> 00:08:13,960
entrepreneurial,
which helps the economy too diverse.

158
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,163
In Chile,
the rate of entrepreneurship among 

159
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:22,270
immigrants is four times higher than 
that among native Chileans.

160
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,930
The second problem is that the so called
social data is not working.

161
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:26,793
That is deceived.
There are new changes in the social 

162
00:08:27,851 --> 00:08:28,960
classes.
If you're born boy,

163
00:08:28,961 --> 00:08:30,310
you die poor.
If you're born rich,

164
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,590
you'd die rich.
In fact,

165
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,443
the country is really controlled by 
seven families whose wealth is 

166
00:08:34,361 --> 00:08:37,390
equivalent to 17 percent of the national
GDP.

167
00:08:37,450 --> 00:08:38,283
This might seem unimportant,
but when the social ladder in 

168
00:08:40,701 --> 00:08:41,534
competition don't work,
it means the family name is more 

169
00:08:44,051 --> 00:08:48,280
important than talent and effort.
The opportunity costs for the country is

170
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:52,450
huge and these families usually have 
quite special relationships with power.

171
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:53,433
Consider this

172
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:00,790
bachelet son was charged with corruption
and Ronica look,

173
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,910
which one of the most powerful men in 
Chile and the owner of the Bank of Chile

174
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:06,410
was also involved in the scandal.

175
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,343
Yup.
Even the back of that name has been 

176
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:11,310
spoiled with corruption.
Then there's the bureaucracy.

177
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,890
I'm sure you've heard that Chile is a 
very free economy.

178
00:09:13,891 --> 00:09:15,360
Well,
when you take a closer look,

179
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:20,070
you can see it's also very bureaucratic.
It has all kinds of regulations.

180
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:20,933
For instance,
Chiney can't import secondhand cars and 

181
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:25,740
foreign workers don't have access to a 
bank accounts so well.

182
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:28,560
It certainly seems as if it could be 
more free.

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,440
Mark Twain said that all three kinds of 
lies,

184
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:33,930
lies,
Damn lies and statistics.

185
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:36,830
The thing is initially,
well they probably have some of that

186
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:42,100
selections in the country will take 
place on the 19th of November,

187
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:45,850
2017,
and one thing is for sure if Jenny wants

188
00:09:45,851 --> 00:09:49,290
to go back to the good times,
they must change direction.

189
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:49,751
It's like,
well,

190
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,370
that's our opinion here,
official policy Polish.

191
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,260
Now.
We'd love to know what you think.

192
00:09:53,261 --> 00:09:56,800
What is your opinion of backlash?
What do you think of the Chilean model?

193
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:57,663
Well,
please leave your answers in the
