1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:08,490
Bolivia,
Chile,

2
00:00:08,530 --> 00:00:12,250
all the fifty cents and Kanye west of 
Latin America.

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:14,080
Now it is true,
they share a border,

4
00:00:14,081 --> 00:00:16,540
but other than that they couldn't be 
more different.

5
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:19,390
So Olivia is one of the poorest 
countries on the whole continents.

6
00:00:19,391 --> 00:00:20,224
While Chile is among the wealthiest 
Bolivia is a paragon of these so called 

7
00:00:23,381 --> 00:00:24,214
indigenous socialism.
While Chile is known as the mod or of 

8
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:29,800
Neo liberalism,
and as if this was not enough,

9
00:00:29,801 --> 00:00:30,634
the two countries are involved in 
seemingly never ending territorial 

10
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:34,534
disputes with each other nonetheless.
Now that is one thing that these two 

11
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:39,880
countries have in common.
Yes.

12
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,090
If you are,
we are talking about a white gold.

13
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,300
God Damn.

14
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:50,950
No,
no,

15
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:51,250
no,
no.

16
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:54,230
That type of white gold.
I'm talking here about lithium.

17
00:00:54,410 --> 00:00:58,040
Lithium is used for the manufacturing of
batteries that power your cell phone,

18
00:00:58,041 --> 00:01:00,350
your laptop,
and those electric cars.

19
00:01:00,351 --> 00:01:03,260
This eventually you might flood our 
roads and highways,

20
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:04,370
the coat,
the new oil.

21
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,710
If the latest metal on the periodic 
table,

22
00:01:06,980 --> 00:01:07,813
it's value has gone up tenfold in the 
last two decades alone and it's demand 

23
00:01:11,271 --> 00:01:12,104
won't stop growing between 60 and 80 
percent of the world's known reserves 

24
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:21,380
are in an area called the lithium 
triangle.

25
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:23,690
This is an area that covers parts of 
Argentina,

26
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,070
Bolivia,
and Chile.

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:28,370
In these countries,
lithium is abundant and easy to extract.

28
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:29,263
In other words,
this part of the planet might soon 

29
00:01:30,981 --> 00:01:32,360
become a new Saudi Arabia

30
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:33,573
forum that it's found in,
is found in these dried up salt lake's 

31
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,100
solars,
so Brian's,

32
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,010
which is very different than getting 
lithium out of hard rock.

33
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:42,873
It's a much cheaper,
much more effective among those three 

34
00:01:44,861 --> 00:01:47,290
countries.
Bolivia is the luckiest one.

35
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:48,333
The so called salons.
A Uni holds two or three times more 

36
00:01:50,471 --> 00:01:53,470
lithium reserves than the mines in 
Argentina or in Chile.

37
00:01:53,620 --> 00:01:54,261
Now,
on the other hand,

38
00:01:54,261 --> 00:01:57,340
the Chili already has a world class 
mining industry.

39
00:01:57,370 --> 00:01:58,810
However,
despite these reserves,

40
00:01:58,811 --> 00:02:02,080
Bolivia is exporting less lithium than 
the other two countries,

41
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:05,620
and shelley might actually soon be out 
of this new white gold rush.

42
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:06,543
In fact,
Argentina is the nation that is getting 

43
00:02:07,781 --> 00:02:10,090
the most attention from international 
investors,

44
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:13,900
so today's question has to be what's 
going on in Bolivia?

45
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:14,823
Why is no one exploiting?
Then lithium resources and why is Chili 

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,843
following six today?
We're going to answer all of those 

47
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:22,030
questions,
but before we do,

48
00:02:22,060 --> 00:02:23,420
let's take a look at the history

49
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,290
new Potosi.

50
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:28,253
Now,
if you've been subscribed to visual 

51
00:02:28,981 --> 00:02:29,814
policy for a while,
you already know that having natural 

52
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,690
resources doesn't mean that you are 
rich,

53
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:35,640
but if he is an excellent example of

54
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:37,460
yes,

55
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:40,913
the country has all the natural wealth,
you can imagine lithium Silva natural 

56
00:02:44,431 --> 00:02:45,570
gas.
Nevertheless,

57
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:49,280
it is still one of the poorest countries
in all of South America.

58
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,223
The silver mines of Potosi,
where the state of war for the Spanish 

59
00:02:52,901 --> 00:02:55,150
crown during the 16th and 17th centuries

60
00:02:58,400 --> 00:02:58,780
backed

61
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,100
Spaniard still say

62
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,370
this is worth a potosi,
meaning that something is too expensive,

63
00:03:03,430 --> 00:03:04,263
but the native Bolivians didn't reap the
benefits of that silver wealth and 

64
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:10,750
millions died under the stream working 
conditions in the mines.

65
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,260
This is why it's pretty understandable 
that the governments of Evo Morales says

66
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:15,173
is so reluctant to allow foreign 
companies to get into the country and 

67
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:18,690
extract the liquid.

68
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:19,573
Yeah,

69
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:23,800
let's Let.
Let's be honest,

70
00:03:23,801 --> 00:03:26,320
the real business here is not the raw 
materials,

71
00:03:26,321 --> 00:03:29,860
Bart in the industry that comes 
afterwards for a better understanding of

72
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:30,694
this.
Why don't we make this video a metric 

73
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:35,620
ton of lithium costs around $9,000 on 
the international market,

74
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:36,663
but if we take that raw lithium,
then we turn it into batteries for 

75
00:03:39,011 --> 00:03:42,100
mobile phones,
we can turn that lithium into a value of

76
00:03:42,101 --> 00:03:45,850
somewhere between one point five and 
$5,000,000.

77
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,713
Of course,
this is just a rough estimate of value 

78
00:03:47,891 --> 00:03:50,180
and there are lots of things that should
be considered here,

79
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:51,123
but it can help to look into comparison.
Indeed it can help explain it and use 

80
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:55,143
this.

81
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:55,993
Plus he take Abel Morales Morales opened
in 2013 the first plant of lithium 

82
00:04:01,111 --> 00:04:06,111
carbonate and in February 2014 limit the
first manufacturing facility for lithium

83
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:07,860
ion batteries,

84
00:04:07,990 --> 00:04:11,560
but that is not all in Bolivia.
Lithium is nationalized.

85
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:12,423
This means that if you are a private 
mining company and you want to work on 

86
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:17,350
Canadian soil,
you must partner with the government and

87
00:04:17,351 --> 00:04:20,830
start a new company which will be owned 
partly by the governments.

88
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,830
This new company can get paid for their 
service and building the mind,

89
00:04:23,831 --> 00:04:26,410
setting up the machinery and extracting 
the lithium.

90
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:27,843
The lithium,
they extract well that belongs to the 

91
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:31,990
government.
They have no rights to it.

92
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,383
What do you wondering?
Why does Bolivia need foreign companies 

93
00:04:38,341 --> 00:04:42,120
to exploit that wealth?
They simply do it themselves.

94
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:44,740
Well,
the short answer is no.

95
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:45,833
Modern Day mining,
it has nothing to do with the image you 

96
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:50,760
probably have in your mind's going with 
a hardhat on they pick axe.

97
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,743
Today.
Mining requires high ends machinery and 

98
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,770
world class engineers.
As you can imagine,

99
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,290
these things are scarce in a country is 
poor,

100
00:04:58,291 --> 00:04:58,820
has been,

101
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,653
yeah.

102
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:06,120
Create a competitive mining industry in 
that country without outside help.

103
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,013
You would need decades.
This is why it is so important to 

104
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,720
utilize companies who have the 
technology,

105
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,060
the tools,
and the staff to do the job.

106
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:15,953
And this is why even Moralez himself 
friendly to multinationals have said 

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:22,590
that it's time to get out there and find
investors,

108
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:26,010
elemental getting used.
We have a big lithium industry,

109
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:26,933
Bolivia.
We'll set the lithium price for the 

110
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:33,260
whole world.
I want you to say to you governments and

111
00:05:33,391 --> 00:05:35,880
private companies now you can join us.

112
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:42,790
So.

113
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:44,530
Alright,
so what exactly is the problem here?

114
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:45,460
Well,
as we said before,

115
00:05:45,461 --> 00:05:46,294
Bolivian lithium is owned by the state.
This means that companies that might 

116
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,223
invest in the country can only get to 
profit by partnering with the 

117
00:05:52,361 --> 00:05:55,060
governments and from that profit,
a famous pay,

118
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,880
a special mining tax that goes up to 37 
point five percent,

119
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,730
which is by far the largest in the 
region.

120
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,230
And if all of this wasn't enough,
well,

121
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:04,064
according to the world's bank,
Bolivia ranks among the 50 countries 

122
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:07,154
where it is hardest to do business,
they rank at about the same level as 

123
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:13,310
Sierra Leone.
So now let's say that you're someone who

124
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,144
wants to invest in lithium.
Do you fancy investing in Bolivia or 

125
00:06:16,851 --> 00:06:19,700
maybe you might prefer one of those 
other countries.

126
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,683
You know,
maybe this explains why the moments 

127
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:26,840
Bolivia Wallace is the country with the 
biggest lithium resources.

128
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:29,060
It is also the country that is 
exploiting them.

129
00:06:29,061 --> 00:06:31,250
The least.
If you pay attention to the chart,

130
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:32,563
you will see that today,
the leader of the lithium race is 

131
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:40,361
awesome,
surprising because the resources of this

132
00:06:41,761 --> 00:06:45,180
country off four times smaller than 
those of Bolivia Fonts,

133
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:48,600
Australian salaries are six times higher
than Bolivian ones.

134
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:49,613
So as you can see,
this is not a matter of low pay jobs on 

135
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:53,263
natural wealth,
but simply good and bad economic 

136
00:06:56,101 --> 00:06:56,934
policies.
But hold on just a minute because this 

137
00:06:58,771 --> 00:06:59,604
is not the only problem.
Don't forget that Evo Morales dream is 

138
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:07,110
for Bolivia to become a manufacturing 
leader in the lithium battery industry.

139
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,203
But I mean how exactly is he going to 
achieve this without foreign companies 

140
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:12,560
setting up insight.

141
00:07:17,140 --> 00:07:17,980
Alright,
so yeah,

142
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:18,823
the government can set up its own 
factory and that's all great and 

143
00:07:21,171 --> 00:07:22,004
everything,
but technology patents and the skills 

144
00:07:23,721 --> 00:07:26,210
needed that held by companies like 
Panasonic.

145
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,970
Samsung will tesla without these 
Bolivia,

146
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,833
would need decades of research in order 
to be competitive on the international 

147
00:07:33,531 --> 00:07:34,364
markets.
Alright,

148
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,263
so a while ago we mentioned Chili.
Now let's go over and have a look at 

149
00:07:37,521 --> 00:07:38,600
what's happening over there.

150
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:45,650
Chalet follows in the steps of Bolivia.

151
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,593
For years,
Jenny has been known as something of a 

152
00:07:48,371 --> 00:07:49,204
free market,
Disneyland or precisely they're mining 

153
00:07:51,581 --> 00:07:54,460
industry was one of the freest in the 
entire world.

154
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:55,503
We're talking about the country,
whether your comedy relies heavily on 

155
00:07:57,791 --> 00:07:59,140
copper mining.
This is why you have,

156
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:03,550
again 1981 Pinochet's dictatorship past 
these so called mining law.

157
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:09,710
This allowed private businesses to own 
100 percent.

158
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,313
As you can imagine,
this little kickstarted foreign 

159
00:08:12,711 --> 00:08:13,544
investments in the country.
Suddenly lots of companies like the 

160
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:20,030
Australian Bhp Billiton or the Swiss 
xstrata came to Chile.

161
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:21,141
Yeah,
listen,

162
00:08:21,141 --> 00:08:21,974
I know what you're thinking.
All these multinational companies while 

163
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,580
they looted to the country and left it 
in poverty,

164
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,660
rice,
right?

165
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:28,550
Well actually that's

166
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,410
really wrong.
Of course these Canadian,

167
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:33,330
Swiss and Australian companies came to 
extract the cop,

168
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,233
right.

169
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:38,263
Also helped to finance lots of brand new
companies which employ Chilean workers 

170
00:08:41,811 --> 00:08:42,644
and we're headquartered in Santiago,
companies like Manera Escondida or 

171
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,120
Antofagasta mining.

172
00:08:47,210 --> 00:08:49,280
In fact,
thanks to this wave of investors,

173
00:08:49,310 --> 00:08:52,100
Chili now has any world class mining 
industry,

174
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,740
actually many of the engineers that are 
now needed in Bolivia,

175
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,603
they live in the best neighborhoods of 
Santiago and this means that one has 

176
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:03,100
been in a great position to lead this 
point.

177
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:04,770
Gold Rush.
Nonetheless,

178
00:09:04,771 --> 00:09:05,604
in 2016 Chilean presidents,
Michelle Backlash declared that the 

179
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,740
lithium was a different animal

180
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,533
from the strategic condition of lithium,
which is property of all Chilean people 

181
00:09:18,231 --> 00:09:21,950
and we'll keep it state as 
nonconcessional material.

182
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:22,873
In other words,
the governments of Chiney is following 

183
00:09:24,171 --> 00:09:25,004
suit with Bolivia barter.
They do have an important difference in 

184
00:09:27,951 --> 00:09:28,784
this case.
The country already has the technology 

185
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,310
and the staff to exploit its mineral 
wealth in an efficient way.

186
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:36,950
Of course,
many of these companies who were willing

187
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,290
to invest in the country have lost all 
interest,

188
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,213
but surely has its own companies,
so it's not so big a deal besides until 

189
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:44,354
2014.
The other countries have this lithium 

190
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:47,570
triangle in Argentina,
in Bolivia,

191
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:48,553
well way worse places for investments,
so in this case is sort of like in the 

192
00:09:54,921 --> 00:09:57,260
land of the blind,
the one eyed passing is king.

193
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,213
Well,
they entail now Argentina has been the 

194
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,634
big surprise here while Chile and 
Bolivia have nationalized the lithium 

195
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:07,340
and have tried badly to scare away 
foreign companies.

196
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,233
Argentina with Mauricio Macri as its 
president is doing something rather 

197
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:15,230
different and the now getting all the 
attention from international

198
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:16,213
investors.

199
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,033
We're actually going to talk about that 
in upcoming weeks in a sort of second 

200
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,900
part to this video.

202
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,090
In the meantime,
we've got a question for you.

203
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,073
Do you think that Bolivia,
Chile can reap the benefits of their 

204
00:10:33,481 --> 00:10:34,314
lithium with these kinds of policies or 
maybe Argentina will somehow overshadow 

205
00:10:37,881 --> 00:10:38,714
them?
You can leave me in the comment section 

206
00:10:40,290 --> 00:10:43,680
below and just before we go today,
I've got a really important question and
