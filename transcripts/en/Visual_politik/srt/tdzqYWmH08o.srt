1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:01,530
No,
no.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:02,393
I don't think we can talk about the 
Caribbean without mentioning the 

3
00:00:04,021 --> 00:00:04,854
Dominican Republic.
It's a major tourist destination with 

4
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:07,524
the largest economy and even the highest
mountain in all of the island countries 

5
00:00:11,131 --> 00:00:11,964
in the Caribbean.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:13,483
Okay.

7
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,870
The Dominican Republic is a very,
very special place in Latin America.

8
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:25,093
I'm not only saying this because we can 
find amazing places such as Punta Cana 

9
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:31,280
by ib or Puerto Plata here among many,
many others.

10
00:00:31,310 --> 00:00:32,143
I'm also saying it because this was the 
very first place where Christopher 

11
00:00:34,610 --> 00:00:38,510
Columbus has men settled when America 
was discovered in 1492 yup.

12
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:41,630
It's true for good or ill.
Everything started here.

13
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:44,500
This is where Latin America as we know 
it began.

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,833
Okay.

15
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,293
It's capital.
It's Santa Domingo was the first modern 

16
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,020
city on the entire American continent 
here.

17
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:57,854
The first cathedral,
the first university in the first 

18
00:00:59,391 --> 00:01:01,220
hospital were belts,
but yes,

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:02,143
it's true.
If we associate the Dominican Republic 

20
00:01:03,501 --> 00:01:05,170
with anything,
it's going to be tourism.

21
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:16,390
The Sun Revolution.

22
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:23,740
This is by far the country's best face 
and not for nothing folks,

23
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:24,574
the Dominican Republic,
it's trendy thanks to its 1000 miles of 

24
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,400
coastline.
More than 250 miles of amazing Caribbean

25
00:01:30,401 --> 00:01:33,220
beaches.
It's golf courses and huge all inclusive

26
00:01:33,221 --> 00:01:34,054
resorts.
The country is experiencing an 

27
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:40,060
impressive tourist banner.
Of course,

28
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:42,430
this is a story it has been developing 
for a while.

29
00:01:42,500 --> 00:01:43,333
See,
during the 1940s the then 

30
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:46,660
plenipotentiary dictator of the island's
general,

31
00:01:46,661 --> 00:01:50,040
Rafael Trujillo gave the order to 
encourage tourism.

32
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:52,750
This was probably done with the 
intention of filling his pockets.

33
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,440
That sounds the Malecon decentered Mingo
in the first luxury hotel in the city.

34
00:01:56,441 --> 00:02:01,441
The hotel Harroway opens in 1944 years 
later in 1968 the first legislation that

35
00:02:02,291 --> 00:02:05,500
considered tourism development to be of 
national interest was approved.

36
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:08,110
So as you can see,
an emphasis on tourism,

37
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:09,080
not exactly new.

38
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,143
Yeah,

39
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:16,720
but in recent years,
it has completely taken off.

40
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:17,583
In 2017 the Dominican Republic or 
country with just over 10 million 

41
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:21,443
inhabitants managed to attract more than
7 million tourists so quickly that the 

42
00:02:31,401 --> 00:02:32,234
country is expected to overcome the 10 
million international tourists barrier 

43
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:40,600
in no more than three years.
Course.

44
00:02:40,871 --> 00:02:42,460
As you can imagine,
all of this,

45
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,800
he's got consequences in the last five 
years.

46
00:02:44,801 --> 00:02:45,634
Foreign direct investment in the tourism
sector has grown by more than 500% it's 

47
00:02:49,451 --> 00:02:50,284
multiplied by six times.
Nowadays the Dominican Republic is more 

48
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:57,370
than 80,000 hotel rooms and this number,
it just doesn't stop growing.

49
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,240
Okay.

50
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,290
Give you an idea

51
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,183
to accommodate all these visitors.
In 2017 Dominican hotels opened 8,366 

52
00:03:08,841 --> 00:03:12,980
new rooms and an additional 15,000 are 
under construction.

53
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:16,040
Then needle Medina,
president of the Dominican Republic.

54
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,230
The results tourism is already the 
island's main economic activity as if we

55
00:03:20,231 --> 00:03:21,064
take both the wealth this generates 
directly and deans I rags and into 

56
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:26,380
accounts.
It means not one out of every four pesos

57
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:27,214
generated by the economy from tourism.
We could say that the Dominican 

58
00:03:29,921 --> 00:03:30,754
Republicans can discovered and is 
beginning to exploit its peculiar type 

59
00:03:33,881 --> 00:03:36,100
of foil and the truth is that in this 
area,

60
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:38,530
it's almost all good news.
Jack Out,

61
00:03:38,531 --> 00:03:39,364
one of their latest achievements which 
happens in exchange for breaking with 

62
00:03:41,891 --> 00:03:42,724
Taiwan

63
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,340
People's Republic of China is opening up
to Dominican tourism.

64
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:48,533
The Chinese authorities have declared 
the Dominican Republic a tourist 

65
00:03:51,241 --> 00:03:53,160
destination for all its citizens.

66
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,310
Of course we asked a moment because 
that's not it folks,

67
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:57,144
the Dominican Republic,
it's got a different face because here 

68
00:03:59,281 --> 00:04:01,830
in this country we can find a lot of 
lights.

69
00:04:02,130 --> 00:04:07,050
We can also find a lot of shadows that 
we commonly see today in Latin America.

70
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,130
So let's take a look at that.

71
00:04:14,850 --> 00:04:15,930
The other face,

72
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,313
the Dominican Republic has achieved one 
of the highest growth rates in Latin 

73
00:04:21,991 --> 00:04:24,900
America and the Caribbean in the last 25
years.

74
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,763
This strong performances,
actually men's achieving a higher 

75
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:28,344
purchasing power parity as well as one 
of the 10 highest per capita incomes in 

76
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:32,993
all of Latin America.
I'd almost a $17,000 the Dominican 

77
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,060
Republic is paired with Costa Rica and 
to well above countries such as Peru,

78
00:04:39,090 --> 00:04:40,410
Colombia,
or Ecuador.

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,260
Hold on a second because that's not the 
whole story yet.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:47,960
In spite of everything,
32% of all dominicans,

81
00:04:47,961 --> 00:04:51,260
that is one in every three people live 
below the poverty line.

82
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,123
The average life expectancy belly exceed
70 and infant mortality is almost five 

83
00:04:56,151 --> 00:04:58,190
times higher than in developed 
countries.

84
00:04:58,490 --> 00:04:59,323
Okay?

85
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:01,283
That may explain why we can find a one 
and a half million Dominican's in the 

86
00:05:03,751 --> 00:05:04,584
United States and why often tourism 
we're missing says are the second 

87
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,630
largest source of wealth.
But having said that,

88
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:12,220
I think the question we can all ask 
ourselves as well,

89
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:17,300
how can such a paradise not take off?
Well,

90
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:21,084
folks,
the answer is that this Caribbean lambs 

91
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,280
has many of the evils that unfortunately
are all over Latin America.

92
00:05:26,310 --> 00:05:31,050
Okay?
Yup,

93
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:31,160
Yup.

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:31,993
The and modern history,
it began here in 1492 now 526 years 

95
00:05:36,111 --> 00:05:36,944
later,
we can find a good reflection of the 

96
00:05:38,570 --> 00:05:42,140
best and worst in Latin America in this 
exact same place,

97
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:43,003
but delving into this mass of the first 
great points of darkness we can find is 

98
00:05:45,621 --> 00:05:49,820
these stubborn persistence in keeping 
policies that have repeatedly been shown

99
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,713
not to work.
An issue that seems to reign in this 

100
00:05:52,881 --> 00:05:54,500
region of the world.
For example,

101
00:05:54,501 --> 00:05:55,334
in matters of informal work irregular,
which is a serious problem that has 

102
00:05:58,821 --> 00:05:59,654
spread throughout the region.
See the workers who are exposed to the 

103
00:06:05,301 --> 00:06:07,160
situation to in formality?
Well,

104
00:06:07,161 --> 00:06:07,994
it comes up more precarious conditions 
with greater instability as well as 

105
00:06:10,911 --> 00:06:14,000
having problems obtaining financing,
whether that's to buy a house,

106
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:16,610
invest in the business or properly 
educate their children.

107
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:17,523
And of course they have lower wages.
I mean this is pretty obvious because 

108
00:06:23,521 --> 00:06:27,210
the company will invest less money in an
employee who's hired irregularly,

109
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:29,310
but this is also a problem for the 
governments.

110
00:06:29,311 --> 00:06:31,080
For example,
when it comes to collect taxes,

111
00:06:31,350 --> 00:06:32,183
smooth

112
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:36,823
one in the Dominican Republic in formal 
employment affects six out of every 10 

113
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:41,810
workers in this country.
Then I'm going to,

114
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:44,990
it's not decreasing.
It's growing in 2017 for example,

115
00:06:44,991 --> 00:06:48,290
formal jobs were only created in the 
public sector and well,

116
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,124
what does this info tell us?
While this is that formal hiring 

117
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,470
involves many barriers and many burdens.
These can be bureaucracy,

118
00:06:54,471 --> 00:06:56,210
taxes,
outdated regulations.

119
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,073
These basically mean that people have to
set up and pay taxes before they even 

120
00:06:59,391 --> 00:07:00,224
make a single dollar and all that.
Logically it makes it difficult for 

121
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,620
private economies do create policy jobs.
So with this data in hands,

122
00:07:10,621 --> 00:07:12,390
I think it would it make sense to say,
well,

123
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:14,400
hey,
we need a boost in formal hiring.

124
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:15,750
Well,
what's not working?

125
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,640
But unfortunately it doesn't work like 
that.

126
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:18,474
The same goes for commercial policy.
You see in a country with a small local 

127
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:24,450
markets as is precisely the Dominican 
republics case,

128
00:07:24,451 --> 00:07:26,670
the foreign sector is absolutely 
essential.

129
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:28,130
This seems pretty obvious,
right?

130
00:07:28,131 --> 00:07:28,964
It's,
well in this country we can basically 

131
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:35,091
find two different situations.
On the one hand,

132
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:36,793
there's the free zones where the 
companies in stalls have favorable 

133
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,630
conditions,
both regulatory and fiscal,

134
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,493
which they provide in exchange for 
basically only working in export swath 

135
00:07:45,591 --> 00:07:48,590
meeting a certain criteria and is being 
approved by the government.

136
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:49,483
On the other hand,
they're raw of the more normal 

137
00:07:50,811 --> 00:07:53,060
companies,
which they're the vast majority,

138
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,923
well,
more than half of all exports come from 

139
00:07:55,701 --> 00:07:57,440
the free zones.
And additionally,

140
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,274
in recent years,
exports from these places have grown on 

141
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:01,280
average 5% every year.

142
00:08:01,290 --> 00:08:02,123
Yeah.

143
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,590
Sports from common Dominican companies.
Well,

144
00:08:07,660 --> 00:08:08,550
well check this out.

145
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:15,800
Sorry.
So

146
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:19,190
upon seeing this,
the question I ask myself is if the free

147
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,024
zones work well,
why not extend their benefits to the 

148
00:08:21,711 --> 00:08:24,950
rest of the country so the Dominican 
companies can become more competitive?

149
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,990
Well,
unfortunately that's not going to happen

150
00:08:26,991 --> 00:08:27,824
either.
But then there's the issues of the 

151
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:30,710
deficit,
public spending and debts,

152
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:31,573
which in spite of the great number of 
bad experiences continues to be a vice 

153
00:08:34,751 --> 00:08:35,584
of many Latin American countries here.
The Dominican Republic is also not an 

154
00:08:38,991 --> 00:08:43,400
exception since 1990 public spending in 
the Dominican Republic has multiplied by

155
00:08:43,401 --> 00:08:45,500
18 yeah.
Public deficits.

156
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:50,560
It's almost a tradition.
No,

157
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,980
just hold on for maybe,
because you might be wondering now.

158
00:08:58,981 --> 00:08:59,431
Well,
it's all,

159
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:02,700
I'm an only talking about a country 
that's coming out of poverty.

160
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:03,660
I mean,
there's lots to do.

161
00:09:03,661 --> 00:09:05,760
There's infrastructure that needs to be 
created,

162
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:06,870
this ports,
airports,

163
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:07,704
roads.
They all need to be built so that this 

164
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,880
country can grow.
But do you know what type of expenditure

165
00:09:11,881 --> 00:09:14,850
grows this the most and no,
it's not public investments.

166
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,713
It's actually current expenditure,
which is multiplied by almost 30 since 

167
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:23,250
1990 and of course the expenses have to 
be paid partly with more taxes,

168
00:09:23,251 --> 00:09:26,760
which slows down the creation of formal 
jobs and investments and well,

169
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,330
partly with debt checkout was happening 
with the Dominican debts,

170
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,900
with the devs and interest because of 
course debts,

171
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,753
the hands interest.
Indeed almost one quarter of 

172
00:09:44,111 --> 00:09:46,840
governmental spending goes towards 
paying interest.

173
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,300
That's the third largest figure in all 
of Latin America.

174
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,410
And it won't stop growing.
Well,

175
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:56,140
despite the tourism sector is take off 
this constant stubbornness with policies

176
00:09:56,141 --> 00:09:56,974
that don't work,
explains why Dominican's have so many 

177
00:09:58,691 --> 00:10:01,870
problems and why there is still so much 
poverty in this country.

178
00:10:01,960 --> 00:10:02,793
I mean,
check out how this country ranks in the 

179
00:10:03,731 --> 00:10:05,320
global competitiveness index.

180
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,470
And what about politicians?
Are they involved in other things?

181
00:10:16,471 --> 00:10:19,500
And this is not because the shadows,
they don't end here.

182
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,560
There's a lot more suspicion.

183
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,213
The Dominican Republic is a fantastic 
country and it probably has a promising 

184
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:36,784
future.
And wanting managers to take that big 

185
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:41,110
step,
it really well be like a paradise.

186
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,070
Think about it,
good weather,

187
00:10:42,071 --> 00:10:44,830
good beaches ans money.
It could possibly resist.

188
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:45,723
However,
today the Dominican Republic has two 

189
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:48,003
other very important problems that may 
be stopping the country from taking off 

190
00:10:51,041 --> 00:10:51,874
and it's one of those is corruption.
The Dominican Republic is among the 50 

191
00:10:56,440 --> 00:11:00,100
most corrupt countries according to 
Transparency International.

192
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:00,821
Yeah.
That ride,

193
00:11:00,821 --> 00:11:01,654
the Dominican Republic is considered one
of the most corrupt countries in the 

194
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:07,750
world according to Transparency 
International's ranking,

195
00:11:07,751 --> 00:11:08,740
Oni,
Venezuela,

196
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,120
Haiti,
Guatemala,

197
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:13,780
and Nicaragua in a worse situation in 
Latin America here,

198
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,614
corruption at all levels is very common.
Suspects range from the current 

199
00:11:17,951 --> 00:11:19,470
socialist presidents,
any limit.

200
00:11:19,471 --> 00:11:20,304
Dina who was accused of having finance 
does electoral campaign with bribes to 

201
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:27,830
the police themselves.
In fact,

202
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:30,170
it was in the Dominican Republic for the
construction company.

203
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,004
Oderbrecht in stalls is coordination,
sends up for the bribes that it paid 

204
00:11:33,381 --> 00:11:35,540
internationally in exchange for 
contracts,

205
00:11:35,570 --> 00:11:39,830
and of course,
many of these bribes remains them almost

206
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,663
a hundred million dollars as far as we 
know.

207
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:45,260
These were received by politicians and 
officials in exchange for concessions,

208
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,400
work awards and public contract.
Yeah,

209
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,250
but unfortunately

210
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:53,203
that's not all.
The other problem which is growing is 

211
00:11:54,941 --> 00:11:57,310
drug trafficking.
The Dominican Republic is considered one

212
00:11:57,311 --> 00:11:58,144
of the most important bridge countries 
and it's narcotics distribution centers 

213
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:01,864
by the United States.
Drug traffickers have a problem 

214
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:09,250
exporting drugs from Venezuela.
There are few commercial flights,

215
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:10,173
little container shipping,
no tourists and a collapsed fishing 

216
00:12:13,181 --> 00:12:15,310
sector,
but the Dominican Republic,

217
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:18,400
1400 kilometers away has it all.
In fact,

218
00:12:18,401 --> 00:12:19,234
according to the dea ends,
the European intelligence services 

219
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,054
nowadays,
the Dominican Republic is one of the 

220
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:23,853
main transit countries for narcotics 
that go to the United States and the 

221
00:12:27,221 --> 00:12:29,770
most frequent for cocaine shipments 
coming to Europe,

222
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,750
and of course this is an important 
issue,

223
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:34,030
but that's something we're going to talk
about another day.

224
00:12:34,090 --> 00:12:34,923
In any case,
let's be absolutely clear there are 

225
00:12:37,401 --> 00:12:40,810
problems that unfortunately are common 
in the entire region.

226
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:43,590
The Dominican Republic has achieved a 
lot in recent decades.

227
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:46,960
It's certainly a fantastic place and it 
has a promising future.

228
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:47,883
In this video,
we just wanted to show you some of the 

229
00:12:48,971 --> 00:12:51,850
reasons why this country is not doing as
well as it should,
