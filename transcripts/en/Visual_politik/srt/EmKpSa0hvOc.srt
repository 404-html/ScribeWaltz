1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,580
With a population of over 30 million 
people,

2
00:00:02,660 --> 00:00:03,493
period,
the fourth biggest country in Latin 

3
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,453
America,
one of the richest countries in the 

4
00:00:07,421 --> 00:00:08,254
world in terms of biodiversity and 
natural resources in this vast in 

5
00:00:12,770 --> 00:00:13,603
country,
we can find among other things the 

6
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:16,354
biggest silver reserves,
the third biggest zinc and copper 

7
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:20,074
reserves,
as well as the sixth biggest gold 

8
00:00:21,971 --> 00:00:24,700
reserves in the world.
In today's video,

9
00:00:24,701 --> 00:00:28,960
we're going to be talking all about Peru
equals youtube politic.

10
00:00:36,740 --> 00:00:37,573
Now,
Peru is still ain't poor country and 

11
00:00:39,051 --> 00:00:39,884
there is still a lot of work to be done 
when it comes to its industrial 

12
00:00:42,531 --> 00:00:44,990
framework,
but despite this,

13
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:49,300
Peru stands out among its Latin American
neighbors as an example of it.

14
00:00:49,301 --> 00:00:53,390
Reforms done right and some say that if 
this process continues,

15
00:00:53,391 --> 00:00:57,470
we're soon going to be talking about 
Peru as a great Latin American power.

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:00:58,453
Lima,
it's capital city already has a higher 

17
00:01:00,561 --> 00:01:01,470
GDP.
Even

18
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,473
economic

19
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,573
in the last decade has recorded the 
second biggest growth rate of all 

20
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:14,610
countries in Latin America in the same 
period,

21
00:01:14,611 --> 00:01:15,444
it's GDP has more than doubled.
The investment rate has gone from 13 

22
00:01:19,021 --> 00:01:22,110
percent of GDP to 20 percent under the 
poverty rates.

23
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,160
This is the percentage of people who 
can't afford basic things like food,

24
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,330
clothes,
education,

25
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:30,960
and healthcare has dropped from rates of
over 50 percent in the year,

26
00:01:30,961 --> 00:01:35,961
2000 to 22 percent today.
This is a reduction of more than half,

27
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:37,793
which is not bad at all.
It's a country with the highest poverty 

28
00:01:41,791 --> 00:01:42,624
reduction rate in Latin America during 
the last 13 years and say on top of all 

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,240
that Peru is one of the least indebted 
countries in Latin America.

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:54,090
Bands in fact is one of the least 
indebted in the whole world.

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,680
This is due to a strong determination to
use public funds responsibly.

32
00:01:58,890 --> 00:01:59,723
This is an achievement of perused 
previous governments which were led by 

33
00:02:03,810 --> 00:02:06,230
Alan Garcia.
I'm Zella on polydor.

34
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,420
Because of these leaders,
the public debt has been reduced to less

35
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:14,420
than 50 percent since the year 2000.
That is still.

36
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:18,904
How did it reach a political consensus 
that maintain stability with the 

37
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:25,840
government's budget while also making 
pro markets policy?

38
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:31,130
Yeah,
but one more and go being with them

39
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
now,
this is probably one of the most 

40
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,214
interesting things about Peru and it's 
also where they can see each other 

41
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:41,904
countries even valuable lesson.
We recently made a video talking about 

42
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:48,210
the disaster that is Venezuela,
but the interesting thing is that peruse

43
00:02:48,211 --> 00:02:52,020
economic situation was pretty similar to
Venezuela's in the 19 eighties.

44
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,050
So let's have a look at what happened.
Eight,

45
00:02:58,490 --> 00:02:59,470
these prices

46
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,110
in the 19 seventies and the beginning of
the 19 eighties,

47
00:03:05,170 --> 00:03:08,800
the Peruvian government bets on boosting
the Peruvian economy,

48
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,663
fruit public investments,
they wanted to replace imports and to 

49
00:03:12,011 --> 00:03:15,160
restrict the sale of foreign products.
To achieve this,

50
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:18,580
they had to borrow money which shot up 
the public debt.

51
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:23,020
The results were so bad,
the when the oil crisis happened in 1979

52
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:23,973
and their economic growth slowed down,
peruse government started to have so 

53
00:03:26,981 --> 00:03:31,981
many problems that in 1983 they had to 
suspend their payments to their data's.

54
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,393
In other words,
they failed to pay their debts because 

55
00:03:34,751 --> 00:03:38,530
they ran out of money and the Peruvian 
government collapsed.

56
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:42,280
From that moment,
things went from bad to worse,

57
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,130
and when Alan Garcia came to power in 
1985,

58
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:47,770
the entire country was a bit of a 
disaster.

59
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:51,400
This is when the government started to 
intervene on a massive scale.

60
00:03:51,550 --> 00:03:54,430
They started fixing prices and in the 
labor markets,

61
00:03:54,440 --> 00:03:58,720
they reinforced the inboard replacement 
policies which are limited the number of

62
00:03:58,721 --> 00:03:59,554
products that were available to buy and 
setting an average tariff which reached 

63
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:06,710
66 percent.
Okay.

64
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:13,130
The

65
00:04:13,130 --> 00:04:17,120
public deficit went through the roof and
the informal economy became the norm,

66
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:20,330
so even though there were more than a 
hundred taxes,

67
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,210
the state simply couldn't collect them,
and on top of all that,

68
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:26,150
the governments had collapsed,
so no one wanted to lend them money.

69
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,770
Now you might be wondering what exactly 
did career do?

70
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:32,060
Well,
they started to print more money,

71
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:32,894
which basically made the [inaudible] 
Berean currency worth about as much as 

72
00:04:36,531 --> 00:04:37,364
monopoly money,
as if all of that wasn't enough for 

73
00:04:41,321 --> 00:04:42,154
purview to deal with.
They also have to deal with the narco 

74
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:48,590
traffic and terrorist actions by groups 
such as Mrta and Sendero Luminoso,

75
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,483
which were causing tens of thousands of 
deaths sold across the country because 

76
00:04:53,601 --> 00:04:58,601
we can throw in as soon as band does 
inadequate.

77
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,720
Well,
what was the results of all this wild?

78
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,270
By the end of the decades,
GDP,

79
00:05:05,271 --> 00:05:06,104
you had dropped by 25 percent.
Further its GDP per capita was similar 

80
00:05:09,651 --> 00:05:10,940
to the 19 sixties,
ends.

81
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:14,090
Inflation every year was about 7,500 
percent.

82
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:14,983
It was at this point that the World Bank
recognized Peru as one of the poorest 

83
00:05:17,991 --> 00:05:22,991
countries in the world,
so you can throw them,

84
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:35,300
toby,
me receive,

85
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,920
but according to the situation was so 
grave that the World Bank estimates that

86
00:05:41,961 --> 00:05:46,340
if this had never happened for real GDP 
and purchasing power parity,

87
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:48,720
would today be similar to Israelis,
Spain,

88
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:52,040
or South Korea's no more,
no less.

89
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:52,933
In many ways,
the crisis that Peru faced was very 

90
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:56,960
similar to the crisis facing Venezuela 
today.

91
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,360
For example,
you can see lots of public spending,

92
00:05:59,361 --> 00:06:01,640
potency of taxes,
lots of printing money,

93
00:06:01,641 --> 00:06:03,410
or dropping the price of commodities.
Oh,

94
00:06:03,411 --> 00:06:04,244
and also plenty of violence,
so when we released our video about 

95
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:07,664
Venezuela,
many people asked what we would do to 

96
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,640
solve the problem.
Well,

97
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,900
let's have a look at what [inaudible] 
did

98
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,310
way to prosperity.

99
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:21,543
90 a strong plan of reforms and economic
stabilization began and in fact this is 

100
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:28,050
the same plan that really does still 
exist today.

101
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:31,680
It passed through the following stages 
in order to slow down inflation.

102
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:34,800
First of all,
the it was replaced by a new currency,

103
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:36,960
the new sole.
In addition to this,

104
00:06:36,961 --> 00:06:39,480
the dollarization over the economy was 
allowed,

105
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:43,080
which is essentially where US dollars 
are used in place of a national currency

106
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,530
from vast moments.
Monetary stability in the country became

107
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,393
a national priority.
The tax system was changed and greatly 

108
00:06:50,161 --> 00:06:53,010
simplified with the elimination of 64 
taxes.

109
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:55,960
Further,
the pension system was also reformed and

110
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,813
the Chilean system was used as a model,
but there were also many improvements 

111
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:00,414
made.
This is actually quite a controversial 

112
00:07:01,981 --> 00:07:02,814
topic and something that we're going to 
be addressing in a future of visual 

113
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:07,070
politic videos like don't forget to 
subscribe.

114
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:08,123
Further,
an ambitious program to attract 

115
00:07:09,211 --> 00:07:10,044
investors and privatized public 
utilities was put into motion Syrian 

116
00:07:13,351 --> 00:07:14,184
companies such as Aero Peru,
Electra Lehman and the Peruvian 

117
00:07:17,161 --> 00:07:17,994
telephone company will put into private 
hands a trade openness strategy was put 

118
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:23,940
into place which reduced that 
ridiculously high,

119
00:07:23,941 --> 00:07:28,320
66 percent tariff to something closer to
one point five percent.

120
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:29,840
At the same time.
As this happened,

121
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:34,800
numerous free trade deals were signed,
including a very important ones with the

122
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,300
United States as well as the European 
Union.

123
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:37,343
Then in 2002,
a gradual decentralization of power 

124
00:07:39,961 --> 00:07:40,794
started happening.
The result of this was that most public 

125
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:46,620
investment spending today happens with 
regions and municipalities,

126
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:47,543
and finally and probably the most 
important points was their commitments 

127
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:52,433
to budgetary stability.
This is something that since it was put 

128
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,890
into place,
every government has respected.

129
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,383
It's talking about consequences.
It's actually in 1999 and law was put 

130
00:08:09,751 --> 00:08:13,350
into place called the fiscal 
transparency and prudent snore.

131
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:14,363
This restricts the discretionary power 
of governments to spend more than they 

132
00:08:17,161 --> 00:08:17,994
receive.
This includes correct developments for 

133
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:23,430
public deficit situations.
Many experts on the subject contest.

134
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:28,100
This is one of the most important laws 
in the history of Peru bus.

135
00:08:28,170 --> 00:08:29,003
It's not all roses.
I don't think that we've forgotten the 

136
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:36,110
dark side of this was the nineties.
Tell him his regime.

137
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:41,630
This was an authoritarian regime and the
president of it is now serving a 25 year

138
00:08:41,761 --> 00:08:42,594
jail time.
He was convicted for crimes against 

139
00:08:44,131 --> 00:08:44,964
humanity and its corruption.
So it was important to keep in mind is 

140
00:08:47,201 --> 00:08:48,034
the situation that Venezuela faces today
is similar to the situation that 

141
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:55,140
[inaudible] faced.
So keep in mind there's always a way out

142
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,963
today.

143
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:03,600
So now you might have in your mind the 
question,

144
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,434
why is Peru still a poor country today?
As we said at the beginning of this 

145
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,530
video,
the institutional shortfalls ends,

146
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:14,070
the challenges that faces today on many 
among them.

147
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:18,510
We can't stress enough the high degree 
of legal uncertainty and corruption.

148
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,170
This is something that we can definitely
see with the death squads case.

149
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:26,490
This is where under his regime from 2011
to 2015,

150
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,890
a group of policemen killed innocent 
people for money.

151
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:29,843
Those guilds included a general and a 
major firm peruse national police 

152
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:33,743
further are extremely high levels of 
crime and there's also the chance that 

153
00:09:36,241 --> 00:09:38,410
the mining industry will face the same 
Renzi,

154
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:40,980
a problems that one faces today.
Not to mention,

155
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:41,814
there is a very sharp difference between
the living standards in different 

156
00:09:44,191 --> 00:09:47,430
regions.
On the fifth of June,

157
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,323
2016,
the second rounds of presidential 

158
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:51,294
elections were held where Pedro Pablo 
Kaczynski was elected as the new 

159
00:09:54,811 --> 00:09:55,644
president of the Republic of Peru.
These elections were the closest in 

160
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,880
peruse history and cruises.
Inscape beat out his rival Keiko for him

161
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:04,860
Maury,
who by the way is Alberto.

162
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:08,760
For him or his daughter,
he beats her by just 40,000 votes.

163
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:13,320
The policies announced buying Kaczynski 
include to keep working on the agenda of

164
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:16,230
pushing competitiveness and trade 
openness.

165
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,243
In this regard.
He has pledged to reduce taxes by 10 

166
00:10:18,961 --> 00:10:19,794
percent.
The smes that small or medium sized 

167
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:22,224
enterprises as well as battle against 
bureaucracy remove unnecessary 

168
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:30,621
regulations and to pursue regional 
economic integrations similar to the TPP

169
00:10:30,721 --> 00:10:32,110
or RCP led by teachers,

170
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:38,720
ski against to remain at the helmet 
financial,

171
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:39,593
all of the problems that are affecting 
Peru despite his relative political 

172
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,580
weakness because they're not very 
friendly congress,

173
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,473
I'm sure that the grief of Peru will 
continue and will remain a leader in 

174
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:51,360
growth for Latin America and maybe in a 
few years.

175
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:52,194
Peru,
which is a young nation with an average 

176
00:10:53,251 --> 00:10:54,084
age of 27,
could follow the example of the Asian 

177
00:10:56,311 --> 00:11:00,480
tigers and it gets transformed into a 
major global power.

178
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:02,820
So that is our opinion here.
Revisional visual politic,

179
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:05,280
and we would love to know what you 
think.

180
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,293
We'll be able to leave poverty behind 
and become an economic powerhouse and 

181
00:11:10,021 --> 00:11:12,630
his Kosinski the ideal person to achieve
this.

182
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:15,110
