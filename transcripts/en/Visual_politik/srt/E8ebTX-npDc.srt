1
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:09,103
Latin America is perhaps the region with
the least military ambition in the 

2
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:13,204
world.
The government spends relatively little 

3
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:24,100
on the fence and in general with some 
exceptions,

4
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:29,101
creating large and powerful armies bids,
not exactly a priority like this.

5
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,420
The subjects of the armed forces has 
been very controversial in the region in

6
00:00:36,421 --> 00:00:37,254
recent years,
and that's no one's there because the 

7
00:00:39,061 --> 00:00:42,660
second half of the 20th century,
it wasn't exactly a quiet time.

8
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,670
The Latin America throughout this 
period,

9
00:00:44,671 --> 00:00:47,340
and especially in the 19 sixties and 19 
seventies,

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:51,450
this region was one of the territories 
in the world which was the most effected

11
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:52,710
by military force.

12
00:00:58,390 --> 00:00:59,440
What about Amada

13
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,643
for the easiest?
Practically every country in the region 

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:31,100
participated in what kind of became a 
macabre tradition of military groups and

15
00:01:31,101 --> 00:01:33,470
of course plenty of repression.
For example,

16
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:38,500
let's take a look at 1978 in that year 
among other countries,

17
00:02:05,771 --> 00:02:06,730
Argentina,
Bolivia,

18
00:02:06,731 --> 00:02:07,570
Brazil,
Chile,

19
00:02:07,571 --> 00:02:08,650
Ecuador,
Paraguay,

20
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,540
Peru,
Cuba,

21
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,900
Nicaragua,
Honduras,

22
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,980
El Salvador,
Panama,

23
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:15,160
as even the peaceful year ago when I 
went under a military dictatorship,

24
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:18,400
and do forgive me if I left anything 
else because you could see it's a pretty

25
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:19,234
long list.
Dictators of every kind existed left 

26
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:24,070
rights pro us,
andy us harder,

27
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,430
softer,
but well,

28
00:02:25,431 --> 00:02:29,670
they all had one common elements.
That was repression.

29
00:02:33,430 --> 00:02:34,263
Yeah.
In the framework of the Cold War and 

30
00:02:35,291 --> 00:02:37,270
block struggles,
many of these dictatorships,

31
00:02:37,271 --> 00:02:38,104
they were supported by the United States
under the framework of what was later 

32
00:02:41,141 --> 00:02:41,974
known as Operation Condo,
a sinister intelligence collaboration 

33
00:02:44,891 --> 00:02:46,420
plan.
Fortunately in the military,

34
00:02:46,421 --> 00:02:48,490
dictatorships of the yellows,
Argentina,

35
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,600
Pinochet's,
Chile,

36
00:02:49,601 --> 00:02:52,630
Alfredo strossner's,
Paraguayan Joelle figure raters,

37
00:02:52,631 --> 00:02:53,810
Brazil,
ends border,

38
00:02:53,811 --> 00:02:54,644
Barry's Uruguay.
They will all aided by the CIA in order 

39
00:02:57,821 --> 00:03:02,350
to achieve a single prosecutes and 
annihilate the political opposition,

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:05,920
especially the leftist groups that were 
supported by the Soviet regime.

41
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:06,803
Yeah,

42
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,720
of course.
As you might expect,

43
00:03:09,721 --> 00:03:12,330
the dictatorships forged under the other
political color.

44
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,220
They weren't any better.
Not at all

45
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,133
facts

46
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,203
during this.
It isn't hard to imagine why the armed 

47
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:19,514
forces issue has been so controversial.
Well more than 30 years have now passed 

48
00:03:23,420 --> 00:03:24,253
since this dark periods,
and in this video we're going to be 

49
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:27,074
answering several questions.
What is the current state of Latin 

50
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:30,953
America is all nice?
What functions do they really have and 

51
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:36,290
do they pose any risk to the democracy 
and freedom of these countries?

52
00:03:36,410 --> 00:03:37,640
Well,
that's dive in.

53
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,600
He's in Latin America.
Before we begin,

54
00:03:46,601 --> 00:03:49,250
and just out of curiosity,
well let me ask you a question.

55
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:53,860
Which do you think are the strongest,
most powerful armies in Latin America?

56
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,570
Well,
this is always quite subjective,

57
00:03:56,571 --> 00:04:00,080
but according to the global firepower 
index from 2017,

58
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:00,914
which is an indicator that attempts to 
measure which armies and more powerful 

59
00:04:03,261 --> 00:04:06,950
and the different parameters.
These are the top five in Latin America,

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,420
first place.
Not really surprising.

61
00:04:08,421 --> 00:04:11,180
It goes to Brazil,
which is the greatest regional power.

62
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:13,580
This is followed by you in this order.
Mexico,

63
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:14,750
Argentina,
Peru,

64
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:15,450
and Colombia.

65
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:18,100
Yeah.
The truth is

66
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:18,933
the Latin America is the region with 
these small list of budget dedicated to 

67
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:26,050
defense in 2016,
it was just over one percent of its GDP,

68
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:26,913
which is about $67,000,000,000.
This expenditure is much lower than the 

69
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,624
global average,
especially because last and American 

70
00:04:33,191 --> 00:04:36,280
armies tend to have quite a high number 
of soldiers

71
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:42,850
to get some idea.
In total,

72
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,880
the region has over one point seven,
$3 million soldiers.

73
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,073
Of course,
the combination of a low budget with 

74
00:04:49,271 --> 00:04:53,920
many soldiers needs to outdated armies 
with plenty of operational problems.

75
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,230
Let's take a look at the most important 
army.

76
00:04:56,260 --> 00:05:01,260
The Brazilian army Brazil spends 23 
point $7,000,000,000 every year,

77
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:05,680
which kind of on the face of it seems 
like quite a lot,

78
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:06,341
right?
Well,

79
00:05:06,341 --> 00:05:09,850
the problem is that the army has 340,000
soldiers,

80
00:05:09,851 --> 00:05:14,260
which means that three quarters of the 
budget goes to salaries and pensions.

81
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:16,240
If to this,
we add basic supplies,

82
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:18,940
then the money left for equipment is 
very,

83
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:23,970
very low.
As in the rest of Latin America ratio is

84
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:27,450
a similar.
On average,

85
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:30,840
70 percent of the money goes directly to
salaries.

86
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,700
In other words,
Latin American armies usually have a lot

87
00:05:36,701 --> 00:05:41,701
of soldiers and very little equipment.
Looking inward.

88
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:52,450
Sorry.
So

89
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:55,210
if we talk about armies wars and 
conflicts between countries,

90
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,073
we could say that last and America is 
one the most peaceful regions in the 

91
00:05:59,061 --> 00:05:59,894
world.
The last arms conflict occurred in 1995 

92
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:05,930
and what was later known as the Sun Epa 
wore this involved Ecuador and Peru,

93
00:06:05,931 --> 00:06:08,600
but no formal declaration of war was 
ever made

94
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:14,353
is that the trend has begun that has 
made Latin America a benchmark every 

95
00:06:17,691 --> 00:06:19,700
time there was a conflict between two 
countries,

96
00:06:19,701 --> 00:06:22,490
instead of threatening each other with 
bombs and cannons.

97
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:25,280
Those involved resorts do international 
justice.

98
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:27,560
This is what is currently happening,
for example,

99
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:28,394
with the conflicts between Bolivia and 
Chili over the sea fronts may conflict 

100
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,324
and that is being resolved at the 
International Court of Justice in The 

101
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,850
Hague.
Live your replies to the lawsuit against

102
00:06:37,851 --> 00:06:40,880
Chile at The Hague court for cxs.
However,

103
00:06:40,970 --> 00:06:44,210
internally well things,
they are completely different.

104
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,103
We could say that Latin America has the 
record for being the most peaceful 

105
00:06:47,721 --> 00:06:50,930
region and at the same time the most 
violence one.

106
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:57,630
Here's that between countries,
there is no serious threat of war,

107
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,620
but the situation is different.
If we talk about internal violence,

108
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:02,454
more incredible than that though is the 
fact that one in three homicides that 

109
00:07:05,641 --> 00:07:09,360
occur every year globally,
it take place in Latin America,

110
00:07:09,361 --> 00:07:10,194
so because apparently all enemies there 
are Latin American military forces to 

111
00:07:13,621 --> 00:07:16,830
focus on at home tasks such as 
confronting gorillas,

112
00:07:16,831 --> 00:07:17,664
drug traffic has,
or just dealing with violence in 

113
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:20,100
general.
In fact,

114
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:20,963
in the region,
it is becoming increasingly common for 

115
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:26,580
military forces to replace the police 
and security and surveillance tasks.

116
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,443
The problem here is that evidence shows 
that soldiers aren't really good at 

117
00:07:30,241 --> 00:07:35,241
playing the role of the police.
Insufficient

118
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,173
solution.

119
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:44,900
It's what we might think of first.
Crime rates in Brazil or Mexico far from

120
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:45,734
decreasing have increased since soldiers
began participating in citizen security 

121
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,490
in the five most dangerous cities in the
world.

122
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,840
Caracas,
Acapulco,

123
00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:55,130
San Pedro,
Sula,

124
00:07:55,131 --> 00:07:55,964
central districts and Victoria have a 
military presence and well that's not 

125
00:07:59,841 --> 00:08:00,674
all or abuse extra judicial detentions 
or collateral victims have also 

126
00:08:08,681 --> 00:08:09,514
increased with military presence which 
further favors and feed say culture of 

127
00:08:12,821 --> 00:08:13,654
violence.
This is something that is unfortunately 

128
00:08:15,221 --> 00:08:17,160
40 widespread in the region nowadays.

129
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,090
The

130
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:26,510
is that soldiers are forces trained for 
war in order to eliminate the enemy,

131
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:29,840
not to impose order and the rule of law 
to achieve rule of law,

132
00:08:29,841 --> 00:08:31,490
what is needed to detectives,
courts,

133
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,140
judges,
local police forces,

134
00:08:33,141 --> 00:08:35,570
and even citizen collaboration,
not the military.

135
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,850
We can take a look at what has happened.
For example,

136
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:38,743
in Mexico,

137
00:08:43,660 --> 00:08:46,360
as soon as he became president in 
December 2006,

138
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:50,290
Philippe Calderon declared war on drugs 
and placed the army on the streets.

139
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:52,810
Since then,
not only it has narcotics trafficking,

140
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:56,460
not decreased,
but homicide rates of triples the army.

141
00:08:56,550 --> 00:08:58,770
It's simply not enough.
They can of course,

142
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,340
lender hands in very serious cases,
but they cannot be a police force.

143
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,960
It just doesn't work.
And yes,

144
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:06,090
I do know that corruption in the police 
as a problem,

145
00:09:06,091 --> 00:09:09,210
but this isn't simply fixed by resorting
to using the army.

146
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:10,103
And indeed,
this actually leads to two other major 

147
00:09:11,731 --> 00:09:14,100
problems.
The first one is political risk.

148
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:14,993
So consider this Latin America's armed 
forces must be anti imperialist Eva 

149
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,220
Morales.
Well,

150
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,053
why do you want me to say to me?
Seeing politicians use military forces 

151
00:09:23,671 --> 00:09:26,190
to defend that political ideas,
whatever they might be,

152
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:28,290
seems very,
very dangerous.

153
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,680
Using that power of force is always 
going to be super tempting.

154
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,270
This is what has happened,
for example,

155
00:09:33,271 --> 00:09:34,104
in Venezuela where the armed forces have
pretty much become something like a 

156
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:39,900
Praetorian guard.
For Nicolas Maduro has bolivarian regime

157
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:44,693
as if that wasn't enough.
There is also the big corruption 

158
00:09:47,041 --> 00:09:47,874
problems.
See the military industry is really 

159
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,273
opaque and it's got huge contracts which
are two pretty basic ingredients for 

160
00:09:53,911 --> 00:09:56,670
corruption.
Just have a look at what happens in 2010

161
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:59,550
in the Dominican Republic.
In 2010,

162
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,413
a major corruption scandal affect the 
Dominican armed forces due to the fraud 

163
00:10:03,261 --> 00:10:04,094
and the purchase of eight Super Tucano 
aircraft from the Brazilian company 

164
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:08,373
Embraer.
It is suspected that $87,000,000 

165
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,214
remained in the hands of members of the 
country's political and military 

166
00:10:13,681 --> 00:10:15,390
hierarchy.
Lillian Bobbia,

167
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,090
professor at Bentley University in 
Massachusetts,

168
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:21,750
and that's just one example and it's not
even the most important one.

169
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:22,613
So taking all of this into account and 
maybe it would be a good idea to 

170
00:10:25,351 --> 00:10:30,351
consider some sort of military alliance,
Latin American NATO.

171
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:40,413
No.

172
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,393
Allow me to propose an idea that may 
seem just the touch crazy now based on 

173
00:10:44,911 --> 00:10:45,744
what we've just discussed,
wouldn't it be a good idea to think 

174
00:10:47,641 --> 00:10:48,474
about building a great military alliance
and alliance in which different 

175
00:10:51,211 --> 00:10:55,140
countries could organize and provide 
different units and bodies for different

176
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,530
types of tasks?
This would have several major advantage.

177
00:11:01,050 --> 00:11:01,883
Military influence over political power 
would decrease and sovereignty would be 

178
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:06,930
guaranteed for all countries in 
addition,

179
00:11:06,931 --> 00:11:09,210
and if necessary during natural 
disasters,

180
00:11:09,211 --> 00:11:10,044
Latin American countries could have an 
army that could deploy rapidly where 

181
00:11:12,661 --> 00:11:16,200
they are needed.
It could also push for much needed Latin

182
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,033
American integration and to increase 
this region's role in the world of 

183
00:11:19,291 --> 00:11:20,124
politics

184
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,880
x,

185
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,553
it would free many resources,
both economic and human and this could 

186
00:11:31,381 --> 00:11:32,214
be used to promote citizen security and 
reduce violence rates in these 

187
00:11:35,101 --> 00:11:35,934
countries.

188
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:38,790
In a way

189
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:39,623
the European Union,
they're actually trying to do something 

190
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,544
similar.
So while it may sound like a bit of a 

191
00:11:42,841 --> 00:11:45,630
crazy idea at first,
maybe it's not like crazy after all,

192
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,400
for example,
Costa Rica suppressed,

193
00:11:47,401 --> 00:11:48,234
it's all me decades ago and the results 
in terms of security have been better 

194
00:11:51,090 --> 00:11:54,260
than those of its neighbors.
We've said before here on visual politic

195
00:11:54,261 --> 00:11:55,094
that the 21st century is going to be 
India century and it's probably China 

196
00:11:58,241 --> 00:12:03,241
and Asia in general.
Now we're wondering,

197
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:06,983
maybe not in America too.
Well now you've heard our opinion here 

198
00:12:09,151 --> 00:12:10,800
at visual politic and now it's your 
turn.

199
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,663
Do you agree that soldiers can be used 
to replace the police for matters of 

200
00:12:14,371 --> 00:12:15,180
security?
Well,
