1
00:00:02,390 --> 00:00:05,700
And the reason is the exposure of the 
Panama papers in the paradise papers,

2
00:00:05,701 --> 00:00:06,534
if once again,
but tax havens on the public opinion 

3
00:00:08,881 --> 00:00:13,881
radar in the last two years,
criticism of these places has multiplied

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:15,660
all throughout the wells,
politicians,

5
00:00:15,661 --> 00:00:16,890
businessmen,
soccer players,

6
00:00:16,891 --> 00:00:19,810
singers,
or simply investors and savers.

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:20,753
Many people transfer part of their 
fortunes to these places supposedly to 

8
00:00:24,031 --> 00:00:24,864
pay fewer taxes.
That's why many critics states that if 

9
00:00:26,971 --> 00:00:29,070
it weren't for these millionaire 
paradise,

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:33,090
the 2008 financial crisis would have 
been less of a crisis.

11
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:35,513
We're told that without these paradises,
governments wouldn't have to make so 

12
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:42,840
many cuts with all pay fewer taxes,
and ultimately it would make things much

13
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:43,501
better.
Well,

14
00:00:43,501 --> 00:00:45,750
the question now is how true is all of 
this?

15
00:00:45,751 --> 00:00:49,920
All tax havens rarely so bad for the 
general welfare of the population?

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,060
Well,
let's check it out.

17
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:04,400
The first thing we need to be clear 
about is what a tax haven is.

18
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:14,750
A tax haven is nothing more than a 
jurisdiction with low taxes,

19
00:01:14,751 --> 00:01:15,584
high legal security,
and an extreme amounts of protection of 

20
00:01:18,141 --> 00:01:18,974
the savers privacy.
This is very important because cutting 

21
00:01:21,501 --> 00:01:24,590
taxes isn't enough to turn a territory 
into a tax haven,

22
00:01:24,620 --> 00:01:25,720
not at all.
You see,

23
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,593
the international investors and savers 
who use these jurisdictions really want 

24
00:01:29,721 --> 00:01:30,554
to protect their assets.
That's why they not only demands low 

25
00:01:33,081 --> 00:01:33,914
taxes,
but also legal security that is in 

26
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:37,124
addition to low taxes.
They want to ensure that their assets 

27
00:01:38,931 --> 00:01:42,410
are safe from any kinds of robbery,
nationalization confiscation,

28
00:01:42,411 --> 00:01:43,730
corruption,
inflation,

29
00:01:43,790 --> 00:01:45,080
etc.
Therefore,

30
00:01:45,140 --> 00:01:49,580
what's common to all tax havens even 
more than low taxes isn't legal safety.

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,820
They're all the cayman islands,
Switzerland,

32
00:01:52,821 --> 00:01:53,780
Singapore,
Hong Kong,

33
00:01:53,781 --> 00:01:54,920
cypress,
jersey,

34
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:55,880
ends,
bermuda.

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:59,780
All of these jurisdictions that we 
recognize as important financial centers

36
00:01:59,781 --> 00:02:02,920
in that characterized by their high 
legal safety say this,

37
00:02:02,921 --> 00:02:05,870
essentially know that the government's 
not going to take all of their money.

38
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,270
It's precisely this combination of low 
taxes and high legal security that makes

39
00:02:11,271 --> 00:02:12,104
these territories receive so much 
capital from around the world and to 

40
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,553
grow at rates and much higher than in 
other countries and though operating in 

41
00:02:18,861 --> 00:02:19,694
these places isn't illegal in itself,
despite what the media might suggest 

42
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:25,290
appearing in the paradise papers are in 
the Panama papers.

43
00:02:25,291 --> 00:02:27,860
It doesn't necessarily mean that you've 
committed a crime.

44
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:28,753
In fact,
most of the names on these lists of 

45
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,720
those entirely innocent people,

46
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:37,400
people like alex krivaline,
shakira,

47
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:38,234
whose assets have a legal origin and to 
use tax havens to minimize their tax 

48
00:02:41,511 --> 00:02:45,890
bills within the bounds of the law.
This may seem more or less immoral,

49
00:02:45,891 --> 00:02:46,724
but it's perfectly legal.
Another very important detail which we 

50
00:02:53,231 --> 00:02:57,580
usually forget is that these tax havens 
are a refuge for millions of citizens.

51
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:01,720
You have the misfortune of being in 
authoritarian and extractive country.

52
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,613
we all know that there are many 
countries in the world where the most 

53
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,254
basic human rights on guarantees or wow 
authoritarian governments arbitrarily 

54
00:03:11,531 --> 00:03:15,640
decide who to repress or persecuted that
is.

55
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,520
Many investors don't seek protection 
just for lower taxes.

56
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:21,160
They also escaping political,
ideological,

57
00:03:21,161 --> 00:03:25,480
and religious.
I think for example,

58
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:29,680
of political dissidence in Russia or 
Venezuela or families who are threatened

59
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,603
by kidnapping in Mexico or entrepreneurs
that come from countries with few 

60
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,090
guarantees like Zimbabwe or better 
reduce,

61
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:36,993
well,
they all benefit from being able to 

62
00:03:38,321 --> 00:03:41,320
access jurisdictions that guarantee the 
safety,

63
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,480
that tax havens

64
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,330
because it's also a matter of justice.
And then we do explain it,

65
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,203
most people think it's an aberration,
when some states present messages and 

66
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,950
it's from leaving the country as happens
with the berlin wall,

67
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,803
what we should also probably think it's 
an aberration when states preventing 

68
00:03:56,741 --> 00:03:57,574
their citizens from taking their savings
out of the country and depositing it in 

69
00:04:00,311 --> 00:04:03,310
a more protective foreign jurisdiction.
That is of course,

70
00:04:03,311 --> 00:04:05,530
if they're doing it in compliance with 
the law.

71
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:06,423
In any case,
the truth is that both the media and 

72
00:04:08,411 --> 00:04:09,244
politicians greatly exaggerate the 
Consequences that these tax havens half 

73
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:14,230
on our economies.
So let's check it out.

74
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,330
A very exaggerated

75
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,223
roll.

76
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:27,793
Too many polIticians and journalists tax
havens are greatly responsible for all 

77
00:04:31,161 --> 00:04:31,994
of the ells we suffer,
such as the third world governments 

78
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,560
budget cuts,
inequality,

79
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,240
and under development.
ThiS is what the organization,

80
00:04:38,270 --> 00:04:39,880
oxfam argues.
For example,

81
00:04:39,881 --> 00:04:43,850
I check this out.
The current global inequality crisis has

82
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:44,684
a clear ally in tax havens.
These jurisdictions represent the black 

83
00:04:48,231 --> 00:04:50,180
hole through the development 
opportunities,

84
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:51,023
uh,
millions of people around the world 

85
00:04:52,221 --> 00:04:53,001
fall.
Well,

86
00:04:53,001 --> 00:04:53,834
first of all,
we must state that oxfam is definition 

87
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:57,860
of a tax.
Haven is a bit lax in their opinion.

88
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:00,380
A tax haven is any country that has very
low taxes,

89
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:01,214
especially for foreign investments.
This definition includes countries like 

90
00:05:03,711 --> 00:05:04,544
the Netherlands and Luxembourg,
which of course they received such a 

91
00:05:06,921 --> 00:05:08,810
qualification from the european 
commission,

92
00:05:08,811 --> 00:05:11,150
the european parliament,
or the oec deep,

93
00:05:11,170 --> 00:05:13,100
but all right,
even with this definition,

94
00:05:13,101 --> 00:05:16,380
let's see how important those tax havens
really off.

95
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:25,470
Say,
let's take the case of Spain,

96
00:05:25,471 --> 00:05:26,304
a european union country with a high 
average income that has many economic 

97
00:05:29,461 --> 00:05:31,440
problems as well as high taxes.
Well,

98
00:05:31,441 --> 00:05:34,770
based on their government's own data,
Spain invested 40 point nine,

99
00:05:34,771 --> 00:05:35,604
$1,
billion euros overseas in 2016 of this 

100
00:05:37,981 --> 00:05:39,210
total.
Nine point five,

101
00:05:39,211 --> 00:05:42,720
4 billion ended up in what?
Oxfam mccall's tax havens.

102
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,613
Nine point five,
$4 million is less than five percent of 

103
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,223
everything.
Spanish people invested in the entire 

104
00:05:48,001 --> 00:05:50,430
world,
including Spain during that year.

105
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,323
So really the reality is that the 
relevance of these tax savings isn't 

106
00:05:53,641 --> 00:05:56,340
quite as great as it's made out to be.
In fact,

107
00:05:56,341 --> 00:05:57,174
the highest place the world heritage of 
tax havens at about seven point 

108
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:04,040
$6,000,000,000,000.
And that might seem like a huge number,

109
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:05,900
but when you look at it from a global 
perspective,

110
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:08,630
it's actually quite small,
so we might not like it,

111
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:09,493
but the truth is that tax havens can 
hardly be responsible for the big 

112
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:15,410
problems that many critics say they are.
But that's not all here.

113
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,273
Let's return to Spain situation.
80 seven percent of the spanish 

114
00:06:21,681 --> 00:06:22,514
investments that went to oxfam's tax 
havens in 2016 were concentrated in 

115
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,580
Ireland,
the Netherlands and Luxembourg.

116
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:31,760
We're talking about a bit over 
$8,000,000

117
00:06:31,761 --> 00:06:32,330
out.
Well,

118
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:33,163
in that same year,
these three countries invested over 

119
00:06:34,701 --> 00:06:36,830
$12,000,000,000
into Spain.

120
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:40,220
As you can see,
tax havens not only do two d capitalize,

121
00:06:40,221 --> 00:06:43,640
the business fabric of a country is 
fiscally uncompetitive as Spain.

122
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,020
In fact,
it's quite the opposite.

123
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:48,320
These tax havens of helped capitalize 
the week spanish economy.

124
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,820
Luxembourg is the country that invest 
the most in Spain,

125
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,710
in factorieS,
buildings,

126
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:57,300
farms,
employment,

127
00:06:57,330 --> 00:06:58,163
but it isn't public,
but private money most comes from 

128
00:07:00,421 --> 00:07:03,870
companies and savings vehicles 
established in the country.

129
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:04,970
Javier,
gee,

130
00:07:04,971 --> 00:07:07,920
your in economics journalist in it'll 
competency are.

131
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:11,100
But Having said that,
let's look at another key question.

132
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:13,170
How much revenue did governments lose

133
00:07:13,630 --> 00:07:16,970
result of tax havens?
Is it true that without them there would

134
00:07:16,971 --> 00:07:19,070
have been no cuts during the crisis?
Well,

135
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:19,904
let's see.

136
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:28,510
Story of the milKmaid.

137
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,233
We've seen one of the most common 
criticisms tax havens yet is that if we 

138
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:34,954
hadn't had such unfair competition,
governments wouldn't have had to make 

139
00:07:37,601 --> 00:07:41,170
budget cuts as a result of the 2008 
financial crisis.

140
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:42,610
But is it true?
Well,

141
00:07:42,611 --> 00:07:44,000
let's get baCk to our spanish case 
again.

142
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,113
As you know,
this is one of the countries that 

143
00:07:47,291 --> 00:07:49,480
suffered the most from the recession.
Well,

144
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:51,670
according to data from the spanish 
ministry of economy,

145
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:52,504
the investment accumulated in oxfam 
defined tax savings year after year 

146
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,230
announced an $80 million dollars.
Well,

147
00:07:59,231 --> 00:08:01,420
if all of that money had been 
accumulated in Spain,

148
00:08:01,421 --> 00:08:02,254
instead of tax havens,
the extra income that the spanish state 

149
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:07,750
would have received would have been 
approximately one to one point 5 billion

150
00:08:07,751 --> 00:08:08,740
euros.
Again,

151
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:09,593
it sounds like quite a bit of money,
but I promise you it's a really 

152
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,120
minuscule amount in the overall scheme 
of

153
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:14,043
thanks.

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,810
Give you an idea about that.
It's about zero point one percent of the

155
00:08:19,811 --> 00:08:24,550
spanish gdp and less than point five 
percent of all taxes collected.

156
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,473
In other words,
it has a very limited impact and if 

157
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:32,253
instead of Spain we took a look at 
what's happening in the rest of the 

158
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:36,370
world,
the situation is pretty similar.

159
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:38,800
In fact,
even if we take the highest estimates of

160
00:08:38,801 --> 00:08:39,634
the tax Justice network,
which is the source that's usually used 

161
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,690
to denounce tax havens,
we'll see.

162
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,900
They show a global collection loss of 
about $200,000,000,000,

163
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:50,500
which is Barely one percent of all the 
tax revenues of the world's governments.

164
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:51,363
No.
The truth is that contrary to what's 

165
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:55,200
usually claimed,
a tax havens aren't to be blamed for the

166
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,034
cuts,
nor do they force us to pay more taxes 

167
00:08:57,751 --> 00:09:00,420
or really harm our economies.
We mAy not like it much,

168
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,313
but it's just the thing.

169
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,220
No.

170
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,480
In 1980 islands was actually poor than 
Spain today.

171
00:09:09,481 --> 00:09:12,120
Thanks to these policies,
that's the second richest country in the

172
00:09:12,121 --> 00:09:14,220
eurozone.
To improve the general welfare,

173
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:17,490
we need more companies,
not more politicians and not more public

174
00:09:17,491 --> 00:09:18,324
spending.
The problems that countries with 

175
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:22,380
economic difficulties face don't usually
come from tax havens,

176
00:09:22,381 --> 00:09:24,300
ms from the politicians,
but now is your time.

177
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,640
Do you think that tax havens should be 
persecuted?

178
00:09:26,641 --> 00:09:27,474
