1
00:00:04,180 --> 00:00:07,470
Two thousand and 17 is coming to an end 
and just before the year ends,

2
00:00:07,471 --> 00:00:08,304
I'd like to say a big thank you from 
everyone here at visual politic for 

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,080
joining us each and every week.
Now,

4
00:00:13,081 --> 00:00:13,914
having said that,
we want to end this year with what we 

5
00:00:15,391 --> 00:00:18,570
hope will be the start of a tradition.
So without further ado,

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:23,630
here are the 2017 visual politic awards.
First of all,

7
00:00:30,731 --> 00:00:31,564
just a quick note it.
We decided to give out four awards 

8
00:00:33,581 --> 00:00:36,310
because there are four of us here at 
visual politic.

9
00:00:36,340 --> 00:00:39,130
It's like let's get into the.
Due to his growing leadership and strong

10
00:00:39,131 --> 00:00:39,964
offensive civil rights.
One of the visual politic awards is for 

11
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:45,910
Justin Trudeau.
Hi everyone.

12
00:00:47,110 --> 00:00:47,943
I'm Justin Trudeau.

13
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,013
They denied the Canadian prime minister 
has been one of the great protagonists 

14
00:00:59,130 --> 00:00:59,963
of 2017 and did we can say that it's 
been a particularly busy year for 

15
00:01:02,601 --> 00:01:03,434
Trudeau,
a year in which this young politician 

16
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:05,714
has become in the eyes of the world,
something of an anti trump and you're 

17
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:10,250
not going to give you a question.
Can you stay category?

18
00:01:10,251 --> 00:01:12,200
Are Fake News,
fake news,

19
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,093
fake news.
They are the enemy of the people this 

20
00:01:15,531 --> 00:01:18,870
morning.
Hey,

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,920
we have respect for journalists in this 
country.

22
00:01:21,921 --> 00:01:25,760
They asked tough questions and they're 
supposed to stay in the last 12 months.

23
00:01:25,761 --> 00:01:28,910
His actions in the field of human rights
have been quite extensive,

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:30,890
so how about we look at some examples?
Well,

25
00:01:30,891 --> 00:01:33,920
the prime minister kicks off the year 
with the welcome to Canada campaign,

26
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:38,060
which aims to welcome refugees and we 
could say that he's really succeeded and

27
00:01:38,061 --> 00:01:38,894
he's made the European Union look bad at
the same time because of that lack of 

28
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:42,290
commitments on the issue.

29
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,083
In recent months,
Canadians have opened their hearts and 

30
00:01:49,941 --> 00:01:50,774
their arms to families fleeing the 
ongoing conflict in Syria and from the 

31
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:55,364
moment they arrived,
those 31,000 refugees were welcomed not 

32
00:01:59,151 --> 00:01:59,984
as burdens,
but as neighbors and friends as new 

33
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,460
Canadians

34
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:07,700
in 2017.
He also gave honorary citizenship Canada

35
00:02:07,701 --> 00:02:10,340
to the Nobel Peace Prize winner,
Malala Yousafzai,

36
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:13,850
a Pakistani activist who fights for 
women's rights and who has been brutally

37
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,684
persecution and attacked by the Taliban.
He has also worked as hard as we saw in 

38
00:02:17,841 --> 00:02:18,674
the video on this channel on is 
integration and recognition of the 

39
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:23,660
indigenous people in Canada,
and last but not least,

40
00:02:23,661 --> 00:02:26,150
in a historic speech you made before 
parliament last November,

41
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:27,343
officially apologized on behalf of the 
federal government for the repression 

42
00:02:30,081 --> 00:02:30,914
that the government's exercised against 
members of the lgbt community until the 

43
00:02:33,501 --> 00:02:34,210
nineties.

44
00:02:34,210 --> 00:02:38,110
We were wrong.
We apologize.

45
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:43,720
I am sorry.
We are sorry,

46
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:54,740
but

47
00:02:54,740 --> 00:02:59,740
that's not all.
This year,

48
00:02:59,751 --> 00:03:00,584
today's government has also reaffirmed 
its intention to legalize the 

49
00:03:03,441 --> 00:03:04,274
recreational use of marijuana.
He has also announced that the 

50
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:09,170
government will increase its number of 
residency permits so that new immigrants

51
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,570
to the country in search of a better 
future.

52
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:12,463
Honestly,
there's not much more you could ask for 

53
00:03:13,181 --> 00:03:13,560
in a single.
Yeah,

54
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:14,393
yeah.

55
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:19,690
Some of you might not be thinking,
well,

56
00:03:19,691 --> 00:03:20,440
okay,
okay.

57
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,880
There's lots of civil rights stuff 
signed it,

58
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,300
but couldn't this just be a distraction 
from the state of their economy,

59
00:03:25,301 --> 00:03:26,740
which really isn't working?
Well,

60
00:03:26,741 --> 00:03:28,690
actually no,
because in matters of economy,

61
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:30,460
it's not actually looking at that 
either.

62
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,353
The Canadian economy expects to close 
2017 with three percent growth and it's 

63
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,820
the lowest unemployment rates in 10 
years.

64
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,920
Along these same lines,
in 2017,

65
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:39,783
Trudeau ratified his free trade 
agreement with the European Union is 

66
00:03:41,981 --> 00:03:44,890
also set his sights on Asia,
especially China.

67
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:48,070
China will soon be the largest market in
the world.

68
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:53,380
It's home to 1 billion potential 
customers for the high quality goods and

69
00:03:53,381 --> 00:03:56,710
services that Canadians deliver every 
day.

70
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,350
It's true that things are going slower 
than expected,

71
00:03:59,351 --> 00:04:00,184
but even so,
there's a very good chance that Canada 

72
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:02,254
will end up becoming a great bridge 
between the American and Chinese 

73
00:04:04,691 --> 00:04:07,920
economies.
Yes,

74
00:04:07,921 --> 00:04:08,754
that is right folks,
and while we may not completely agree 

75
00:04:10,501 --> 00:04:11,334
with Justin Trudeau's agenda,
we do think that he is contributing to 

76
00:04:13,951 --> 00:04:16,800
the construction of a better world for 
all.

77
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,170
So from all of us.
Congratulations Justin.

78
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,290
The next visual holistic award is for 
fighting when the president of Taiwan

79
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,243
price is a bit special in somewhat 
different because with we won't 

80
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:48,580
recognize political success,
but rather the ability to resist.

81
00:04:50,380 --> 00:04:53,180
Allow me to explain.
We decided to give this award to sighing

82
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,023
Wang for two main reasons,
first for being the first female 

83
00:04:56,081 --> 00:04:59,620
president of Taiwan and for being a 
symbol to other East Asian societies.

84
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:00,513
I think the young people are generally 
excited about this idea of hugging a 

85
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:04,624
woman to lead the country.
I thought it was rather trending second 

86
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:09,303
for her from will to defense Taiwan's 
democracy and freedom in the face of 

87
00:05:12,371 --> 00:05:13,204
Beijing's desire for reunification 
because let's not forget that this 

88
00:05:15,551 --> 00:05:19,420
country has one of the most flourishing 
and alive democracies in the region,

89
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,310
and China,
as you may know,

90
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:22,180
is a dictator

91
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:23,700
to share

92
00:05:26,710 --> 00:05:30,670
2017 has been a difficult year for the 
islands and for its presidents.

93
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:37,150
China has unleashed a political and 
economic war against Taiwan,

94
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,760
the likes of which has not been seen for
years.

95
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:40,623
There's all resulted in presidents size,
refusal to commit to the so called 1992 

96
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:47,660
consensus and agreement under which 
China is recognized as a single mom.

97
00:05:55,490 --> 00:05:56,323
And of course if is clear it,
that all this economic and political 

98
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:01,160
pressure poses a huge problem for this 
country.

99
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:03,940
Forty percent of its exports currently 
depends on mainland

100
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:04,833
China,

101
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,260
however,
the viewer fall from surrendering,

102
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,113
citing when this government has 
reinforced it's political strategy to 

103
00:06:12,741 --> 00:06:15,050
sync and consolidate alternatives to 
China,

104
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:18,080
mainly opening the Southeast Asian,
Australian,

105
00:06:18,081 --> 00:06:18,914
and New Zealand markets.
This is known as the new southbound 

106
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:27,280
policy and so far the results have been 
pretty good.

107
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,153
Trade with these countries is growing 
strongly at rates of seven percent at 

108
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,553
the time.
Taiwanese economy is also regained some 

109
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:35,390
vigor and investors have regained 
confidence in this country.

110
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:41,850
This has resulted in quite a bit of 
pressure on China so well even though we

111
00:06:41,851 --> 00:06:43,080
don't like some of the things about 
this.

112
00:06:43,081 --> 00:06:45,660
Governments such as their slowness,
when facing reforms,

113
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:50,070
we really believe that their spirits of 
resistance to Chinese pressure justifies

114
00:06:50,071 --> 00:06:50,904
this truck.

115
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,660
Yep.

116
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:59,930
Fiction with Beijing may not be most 
convenient for the islands interests,

117
00:06:59,950 --> 00:07:01,760
but I think we need to make two things 
clear.

118
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:03,440
First,
when we talk about resistance,

119
00:07:03,441 --> 00:07:04,274
we're talking about protecting one of 
the most democratic and liberal regimes 

120
00:07:06,771 --> 00:07:07,604
in Asia and seconds according to polls.
This policy is clearly backed by 

121
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,374
Taiwanese society.
Due to all of this in when gets one of 

122
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:20,201
this year's visual political wards,
so let's continue and this next award,

123
00:07:25,751 --> 00:07:28,900
it doesn't just go to one politician,
but it goes to an entire political party

124
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,540
and this would be the check pirate 
parties

125
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:37,743
zero,

126
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,490
and so now you might be wondering,
well,

127
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,500
why are we giving this award to the 
check pirate?

128
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,653
Because they came in third in the track,
parliamentary elections that occurred 

129
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,614
this year,
being the second most voted for pirate 

130
00:07:53,451 --> 00:07:56,390
party on the planet,
only surpassed by the Icelandic pirate

131
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,263
posy

132
00:08:00,510 --> 00:08:01,860
to be answered here is,
well,

133
00:08:01,861 --> 00:08:04,980
what does the Pirate Party stands for?
Wealthy pirates ideology,

134
00:08:04,981 --> 00:08:06,690
or as they call it,
the pirate movements.

135
00:08:06,691 --> 00:08:09,150
There was born in Sweden in the year 
2005.

136
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,720
They wanted to protect online privacy 
and to reform copyright laws.

137
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,380
This is why they're called the pirate 
party according to them.

138
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,253
Copyright laws are needless barriers for
entrepreneurs can only help big 

139
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,803
corporations.

140
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,963
Okay,

141
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:27,080
so just hold on a second year because I 
know what you're thinking now.

142
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:27,933
Does this mean that we add visual 
politic are against copyright and 

143
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,790
Intellectual Property Law?
Well,

144
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,160
far from it because the truth is that 
the pirate movements,

145
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:39,030
it has changed a lot since 2005.
Now their manifesto covers far more than

146
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:41,260
what it started with from economic 
foreign policy.

147
00:08:41,540 --> 00:08:44,010
See,
there's

148
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,730
now a big difference between the pirate 
parties in different countries.

149
00:08:46,760 --> 00:08:47,593
Just like a Swedish social democrat is 
totally different from a Spanish Social 

150
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,583
Democrats and Icelandic pirate is seldom
similar to a check pirate so well did 

151
00:08:55,291 --> 00:09:00,291
the check pirate stand for first of all,
tech lovers as they are,

152
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:05,900
they want to implement e-government 
solutions in the same vein as Estonia.

153
00:09:05,940 --> 00:09:09,120
It really makes absolutely no sense that
today in the 21st century,

154
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,954
you need to wait in line for more than 
four hours in an administrative office 

155
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,670
in order to report that you changed your
residence.

156
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,420
This happens today in the Czech Republic
and because I live here,

157
00:09:18,421 --> 00:09:23,421
this is something I've had to do and it 
is an enormous pain in the ass and isn't

158
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:26,740
this kind of bureaucracy madness.
It is not only time consuming,

159
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:30,790
but it's also a big share of the 
government's budget is stonier has saved

160
00:09:30,791 --> 00:09:31,624
millions thanks to these reforms and 
they should be a model for other 

161
00:09:34,211 --> 00:09:36,760
countries plus the check pirates.
They stand for freedom of movement,

162
00:09:36,761 --> 00:09:39,040
freedom of speech and fiscal 
responsibility.

163
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:41,770
During their campaign,
they avoided the temptation of promising

164
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:42,604
more spending or giving grants to anyone
which was especially alluring in an 

165
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,140
election full of populist candidates and
on top of all that,

166
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:51,430
all the ones that legalize weed

167
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:55,753
with this program,
the check pirates came in third in one 

168
00:09:57,591 --> 00:10:00,500
of the Czech Republic's most notable 
elections in history.

169
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,520
Usually in most countries that are two 
or three main political forces,

170
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:08,330
but not anymore in the Czech Republic.
First place went to Anodea lip and their

171
00:10:08,340 --> 00:10:09,173
leader Andre Babish,
but he only obtained the less than 30 

172
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:12,404
percent of the vote after him is the 
sense of rights ods party who made up 

173
00:10:15,321 --> 00:10:18,800
the little more than 10 percent below 
those with almost the same percentage.

174
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:23,840
There aren't pirates,
the virus,

175
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:25,434
the past,
other charismatic and radical 

176
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:28,750
politicians like the communist party and
Mr Tom,

177
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:31,260
Joachim Mira and anti immigration 
candidates.

178
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:32,393
Just as a funny note,
Mr Nakamura is actually originally from 

179
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:39,600
Japan,
so when walking around Prague,

180
00:10:39,610 --> 00:10:40,443
during the elections,
you could see a big picture of a 

181
00:10:41,561 --> 00:10:44,380
Japanese dude which says,
say no to immigration.

182
00:10:44,470 --> 00:10:46,540
It was actually pretty funny.
So in other words,

183
00:10:46,541 --> 00:10:47,374
the check pirates have obtained 
surprising results with a solid and 

184
00:10:49,751 --> 00:10:52,570
rational manifesto.
Some of their proposals certainly better

185
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:53,710
than others,
but in general,

186
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,840
they deserve our applause.
Sire criteria.

187
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:00,860
Lemon nosheen Paretsky.
Last but not least,

188
00:11:02,921 --> 00:11:03,754
the fourth award,
because he couldn't be left out of this 

189
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:06,250
list,
goes to

190
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:12,060
Emmanuel macron make our planet.

191
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:19,533
You said that Mr Macron,
here's one of the biggest surprises of 

192
00:11:21,551 --> 00:11:22,420
the year.
First of all,

193
00:11:22,421 --> 00:11:25,300
you had to create his own political 
party from zero.

194
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:26,350
Yes.
You heard that right?

195
00:11:26,351 --> 00:11:27,184
He started his political career as the 
finance minister in the social 

196
00:11:29,561 --> 00:11:30,394
democratic government of manual valves,
but he was not affiliated with that 

197
00:11:33,521 --> 00:11:35,240
party.
He was an independent.

198
00:11:35,241 --> 00:11:38,020
It's hard because of his achievements 
working in the finance industry.

199
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:38,953
I want France to be a thought that 
nation meaning both a nation is that we 

200
00:11:44,910 --> 00:11:45,743
end for the startups,
but also a nation that thinks and moves 

201
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:54,220
like a and make

202
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:56,800
no mistake here.
He has not had an easy job.

203
00:11:56,840 --> 00:12:00,580
France has been in crisis for years.
As we said in this other video.

204
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:03,070
The country used to be one of the 
world's biggest economies,

205
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:06,550
but now it's companies find it hard to 
compete in the international markets.

206
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:09,400
Part of this is due to the economic 
policies.

207
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,960
The truth is that for decades,
France,

208
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:11,794
fully the ideology of Charles de Gaulle 
man who led the country's economy as if 

209
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:15,364
it was an army.
The goal was obsessed with protecting 

210
00:12:21,311 --> 00:12:22,144
French companies from the outside world,
but the world is different today and 

211
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:30,340
macron wants a 180 degree shift from 
this French economic theory.

212
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:38,390
His manifesto.
It was solid and it was rational.

213
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:42,050
He didn't promise any of those things 
which are impossible to achieve once you

214
00:12:42,051 --> 00:12:45,800
are in office and despite all of this,
you won by a landslide victory.

215
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:47,780
And that's not only in the presidential 
elections,

216
00:12:47,781 --> 00:12:51,320
but the parliamentary ones too.
And if this wasn't impressive enough,

217
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,213
he also did it against Marine Le Pen,
the champion of European populism prior 

218
00:12:55,851 --> 00:12:56,684
to the foundation of Mr macrons party or
marsh pollsters said Le Pen had the 

219
00:13:00,591 --> 00:13:03,980
victory guaranteed.
But macron prove them wrong.

220
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:07,370
Now we just asked him not to disappoint 
us in 2018.

221
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,380
And in the meantime,
congratulations.

222
00:13:09,381 --> 00:13:10,214
And annual.

223
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,253
Okay.

224
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:15,430
These were the 2017 visual political 
wards.

225
00:13:15,431 --> 00:13:17,770
I hope you enjoyed them.
And just before I say goodbye today,

226
00:13:17,830 --> 00:13:18,663
I did want to wish you a happy 2018 and 
thank you for joining us every week on 

227
00:13:22,931 --> 00:13:24,730
this channel.
So to everyone watching,

228
00:13:24,731 --> 00:13:27,460
have a fantastic 2018 and I'll see you 
next year.
