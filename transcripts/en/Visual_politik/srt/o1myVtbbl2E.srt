1
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:11,430
We might not notice it,
but the weld is changing really,

2
00:00:11,460 --> 00:00:12,293
really fun.

3
00:00:13,990 --> 00:00:14,823
Austin

4
00:00:20,350 --> 00:00:21,690
biotechnology,
robotics,

5
00:00:21,691 --> 00:00:25,740
nanotechnology,
every day somewhere on some discovery is

6
00:00:25,741 --> 00:00:26,574
being made.
Discoveries that will make our lines 

7
00:00:27,781 --> 00:00:30,570
longer,
more comfortable and generally just much

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,070
better.
We could always say,

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:35,030
dear viewer,
that we are on board or high speed train

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:35,930
bounds for the future.

11
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:36,883
John,

12
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:40,870
that already companies in existence 
today,

13
00:00:40,871 --> 00:00:43,870
which look like they could have come 
straight out of a science fiction movie.

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,960
Would you like some examples?
Well then are you familiar with Oregon?

15
00:00:46,990 --> 00:00:49,450
Novo?
It's a truly incredible company.

16
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:53,620
It's listed on the Nasdaq and did 
business is no less than the bioprinting

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:54,454
of tissues to implant into the human 
body and thus eliminating the need for 

18
00:00:57,611 --> 00:01:00,760
organ transplants.
Can you imagine printing and liver.

19
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:02,120
It's truly remarkable.

20
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:03,143
Stop.

21
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:07,390
What about the company?
Modern meadow.

22
00:01:07,490 --> 00:01:08,323
This startup's aim is to produce leather
and meet without having to kill any 

23
00:01:10,961 --> 00:01:11,794
animals.
They want to reduce that own stakes in 

24
00:01:13,461 --> 00:01:14,970
the lab and then take them to the bowl.

25
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,843
Oh,
okay.

26
00:01:18,090 --> 00:01:20,250
The question is though,
would you eat it?

27
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,740
So how about another example of a heard 
of Illumina?

28
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,300
It's the largest company dedicated to 
DNA sequencing in the wealth among other

29
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,173
targets.
They are trying to detect cancer before 

30
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:33,000
any of the symptoms appear.
It's almost unbelievable,

31
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,410
isn't it?

32
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:34,243
Yes.

33
00:01:36,050 --> 00:01:36,883
Well,
these are only three of hundreds of 

34
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:41,630
companies which are literally building 
the future today.

35
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:42,410
Well,
you know what?

36
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,090
Organ Printing,
DNA sequencing,

37
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:44,983
that's not really the best part.
The best part is the end of poverty is 

38
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,244
getting closer every day and the reality
is that it's already right around the 

39
00:01:52,341 --> 00:01:53,240
corner.
And listen,

40
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,600
we're not just talking about extreme 
poverty here on the contrary,

41
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:57,463
current realities like hunger or not 
being able to eat meat or not having 

42
00:02:00,441 --> 00:02:04,190
access to healthcare or even not being 
able to go on holiday aren't going to be

43
00:02:04,191 --> 00:02:06,800
rare and very infrequent in the near 
future.

44
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,663
And it's blowing near future.
We mean this is going to be a reality 

45
00:02:09,681 --> 00:02:14,681
and probably just a few years.
Alright.

46
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,520
Alright,
so now some of you must be thinking,

47
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:19,383
Simon's finally lost it.
It's all down here for visual politic 

48
00:02:21,791 --> 00:02:22,900
from here.
Well,

49
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,580
no,
actually I haven't lost my mind.

50
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,100
In fact,
hit with all of you as witnesses.

51
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:29,170
I am willing to bet you that's in the 
next year,

52
00:02:29,171 --> 00:02:34,171
we will experience the best period of 
prosperity in the history of mankind and

53
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:36,430
I'm certainly not the only one who 
shares this opinion.

54
00:02:36,431 --> 00:02:37,264
Listen to what Warren Buffett,
the investment genius has to say about 

55
00:02:39,731 --> 00:02:40,564
it,

56
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,463
or how about Barack Obama as well.
If you had a choice of when to be born 

57
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:51,100
and you didn't know ahead of time who 
you were going to be,

58
00:02:51,101 --> 00:02:55,090
what nationality,
whether you were male or female,

59
00:02:55,091 --> 00:02:55,924
what religion,
but you said when in human history be 

60
00:02:59,201 --> 00:03:00,070
the best time to

61
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
be born.

62
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:04,870
The time would be now while I'm here to 
tell you even more,

63
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,733
this wave of prosperity will bring 
opportunities we've never even thought 

64
00:03:09,221 --> 00:03:10,230
of before.
Alright.

65
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:12,350
Alright.
But for the skeptics era,

66
00:03:12,370 --> 00:03:13,203
the numbers.

67
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,350
Yes.

68
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:22,650
Tonight at the,
by the end of 2016,

69
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,513
three point 2 billion people are already
going to be in the middle class and two 

70
00:03:27,001 --> 00:03:27,834
each year,
more than 140 million people will make 

71
00:03:30,631 --> 00:03:35,520
it into this select club.
It is as if every year a group of people

72
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:38,220
the size of the population of Mexico.
Oh,

73
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:42,060
leaving poverty behind.
Notice that this process is accelerating

74
00:03:42,061 --> 00:03:43,800
and it's expected that by 20,
20,

75
00:03:43,801 --> 00:03:46,350
that's just three years from the time of
this video coming out,

76
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:50,010
most of the world's population will 
belong to the middle class.

77
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:54,950
This growth in the middle class will 
mean that the poor will finally be in

78
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:56,013
Rsa.

79
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:01,983
Before I continue,
I am sure you might be wondering how 

80
00:04:04,690 --> 00:04:09,130
exactly do you define middle class?
Since income levels vary from country to

81
00:04:09,131 --> 00:04:10,750
country.
When we talk about middle class,

82
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,100
what we're talking about is people who 
can afford to have a very diverse people

83
00:04:15,101 --> 00:04:19,120
who can face and cover unexpected 
expenses as well as education and people

84
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:21,220
who can buy an automobile.
These people,

85
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:25,240
they might not be rich,
but they definitely are poor anymore and

86
00:04:25,270 --> 00:04:27,610
this is a brand new thing in the history
of men

87
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:29,580
pies.

88
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:35,740
Now they have an idea of how things are 
changing today.

89
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:38,350
Let's have a look at the historical 
perspective.

90
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:40,600
When the Polian was fighting everyone in
Europe,

91
00:04:40,601 --> 00:04:43,510
only 2 million people could be 
considered middle class.

92
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:46,780
That is less than half of the population
of Singapore today.

93
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,673
A pretty tough situation for the vast 
majority of people who were living at 

94
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:51,790
that time,
well since then,

95
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:55,960
150 years have passed,
but it wasn't until the 19 seventies,

96
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,990
but the number of people in the middle 
class passed the 1 billion people today.

97
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:10,310
The number is about 3 billion by 20,
21 is expected to reach for Binyam ends.

98
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:11,980
As I mentioned,
the process.

99
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:15,250
It's getting faster and faster every 
single day.

100
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:16,143
And this nice middle class,
they are going to make an impressive 

101
00:05:18,431 --> 00:05:19,960
entrance.
Don't believe me.

102
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:24,720
And as we have these billions of people 
in lodging into a global middle class,

103
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:27,420
they need to be fed.
They need to be housed,

104
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,610
they need power,
they need transport,

105
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:31,120
uh,
they want to,

106
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:32,543
they want to travel and see the world.
So there are tremendous opportunities 

107
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:40,830
for an expansion of economic activity to
meet their needs.

108
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:46,900
Yes,

109
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,070
versiti you're looking at right now is 
Hanoi,

110
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,963
which is the capital of Vietnam.
If the country in the world where 

111
00:05:51,891 --> 00:05:52,724
capitalism is actually most liked,
that's according to a recent study from 

112
00:05:55,611 --> 00:06:00,611
the Pew Research Center.
Seems like we're in the west.

113
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,870
Might have some catching up to do.
In fact,

114
00:06:02,871 --> 00:06:05,750
the majority of this new middle class,
they're coming from Asia,

115
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,143
almost nine out of every 10 new people.
They make it to the middle class and 

116
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:18,274
live in Asia.
The continent of the economic boons and 

117
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,293
the growing epicenter of power on earth.
You just have to take a look at 

118
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:26,940
countries like the Philippines or 
Thailand in just a few years.

119
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:27,774
These countries,
middle classes will be as big as those 

120
00:06:29,491 --> 00:06:31,110
in the UK,
France and Italy.

121
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,270
Yes,
they will remain poorer countries,

122
00:06:33,271 --> 00:06:36,330
but the growth of the middle class,
it's still very impressive.

123
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:39,270
Bots do you want to know how things are 
really changing?

124
00:06:39,510 --> 00:06:41,460
Well,
this is Jakarta.

125
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,893
Well that means for the companies,
but that's something we're going to get 

126
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,410
into later,
but out of all these countries,

127
00:06:54,411 --> 00:06:58,210
one is making a particularly big 
difference and that's China who's middle

128
00:06:58,211 --> 00:07:03,050
class has absolutely exploded according 
to estimations by Mckinsey analysts.

129
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:05,720
If in five years this isn't,
the homes of people were to create,

130
00:07:05,721 --> 00:07:08,370
say the Chinese Republic of middle class
citizens,

131
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:13,010
this country would be the third most 
populated country in the world.

132
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:17,330
No bad a sorry if he wants to know what 
these changes really mean.

133
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:21,470
Take a look at Truong quizzing the most 
populated city in China

134
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,870
because of the growth of the middle 
class.

135
00:07:30,871 --> 00:07:34,650
These people now have money available to
buy all kinds of products,

136
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:38,250
clothing and like tronics cars and of 
course travel,

137
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:41,430
and now you can probably understand why 
the countries in Asia,

138
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:42,413
especially China,
are so important for multinational 

139
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:45,770
companies.

140
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:46,603
Canada's largest online ride hailing 
platform dd two things that it's 

141
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,464
received.
One billion US dollars from us tech 

142
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:53,800
giants,
apple pay

143
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:54,763
close attention to this data because 
it's probably interesting if you're 

144
00:07:56,931 --> 00:08:00,290
starting a business,
it is estimated that the spending growth

145
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:01,153
of the Chinese in the next four years 
alone will exceed what the British or 

146
00:08:04,221 --> 00:08:05,670
German spent.
Sorry,

147
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,513
refute our visual politic.
Friends are the company you might want 

148
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:09,554
to think about investigating the Asian 
market because many opportunities will 

149
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:14,090
appear in the next few years.

150
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:22,750
Consequences

151
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:23,583
of this,
I'm just an opportunity to make money 

152
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:27,760
and do more business.
Probably the most important consequences

153
00:08:27,790 --> 00:08:31,720
of this middle class expansion is that 
we will live in a happier world.

154
00:08:31,930 --> 00:08:32,763
Let me explain.
You've probably heard the phrase money 

155
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,680
doesn't make you happy.
Well,

156
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,690
actually,
according to recent research,

157
00:08:37,691 --> 00:08:38,524
this is not entirely true.
In 2010 Angus Deaton and Daniel Conaman 

158
00:08:42,310 --> 00:08:45,940
booster winners of the Nobel Prize in 
economics presented a paper which proved

159
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:46,803
that up to the figure of $75,000 a year,
happiness and income with very closely 

160
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:52,294
related,
meaning more income equals more 

161
00:08:54,041 --> 00:08:56,880
happiness up to $5,000 a year.
I mean,

162
00:08:56,881 --> 00:08:58,320
this makes sense.
We have more money.

163
00:08:58,321 --> 00:09:00,540
You don't have to worry about making it 
to the end of the month,

164
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:03,630
paying your bills and not having enough 
to eat as well as not being able to take

165
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:07,620
your family to the doctor and etc. Etc.
So according to thEse two academics,

166
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:10,980
the expansion of the middle class is 
leading to a happier world.

167
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:13,020
But wait just a minute because there is 
more.

168
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:15,630
More middle claSs means more educated 
people.

169
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,000
This means more researchers and more 
entrepreneurs,

170
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:19,770
more ideas,
more innovation.

171
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:20,633
Man's therefore more progress.
Well today in China that are more 

172
00:09:23,611 --> 00:09:26,190
college students have any in the United 
States.

173
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,710
Remember the companies that we saw at 
the beginning of this video,

174
00:09:28,711 --> 00:09:29,730
well,
soon enough,

175
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:32,250
there are going to be plenty more of 
those.

176
00:09:36,210 --> 00:09:37,080
Now.
You may be wondering,

177
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:40,200
is this all really is wonderful as we're
describing a visual politic?

178
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:43,950
How come people such as Donald Trump and
le pen are so popular then?

179
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:44,843
Well,
this middle class boom is not happening 

180
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:49,200
in all parts of the world.
Therefore it's really important.

181
00:09:49,201 --> 00:09:52,560
We understand that if western economies 
aren't working perfectly,

182
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,453
are having problems,
they should take responsibility for it 

183
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:59,790
and stop blaming it on other countries.
There are plenty of opportunities in the

184
00:09:59,791 --> 00:10:03,630
global economy and now is the time to 
adapt and sees them,

185
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:06,030
but now I can probably guess what your 
thinking is.

186
00:10:06,031 --> 00:10:08,640
All of this group really sustainable 
ways.

187
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:09,503
All of this progress and development 
destroy the environment so cause other 

188
00:10:12,511 --> 00:10:13,650
such problems.
Well,

189
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:14,970
that's not exactly clear.

190
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:22,513
It's true that in theory,
more middle class means more spending 

191
00:10:25,131 --> 00:10:28,610
and therefore more consumerism and more 
pressure on natural resources,

192
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:29,463
etc. But that awesome things to consider
first more middle class also means more 

193
00:10:33,141 --> 00:10:37,040
people in big cities and the consumerism
here is usually more sustainable.

194
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:39,200
Transport is the most evidence.
Example,

195
00:10:39,260 --> 00:10:41,960
my public transport is frequent in large
cities.

196
00:10:41,961 --> 00:10:42,794
It is rare in small places.
More middle class also means faster 

197
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:46,874
demographic transition,
so more women's study and work and say 

198
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:53,150
the population tends to shrink as well 
and above all more middle class means,

199
00:10:53,151 --> 00:10:56,540
as we said before,
more ideas and more innovation and among

200
00:10:56,541 --> 00:11:00,350
these things are often ideas which allow
more sustainable consumerism.

201
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:04,340
So however we want to approach this 
situation and although that is certainly

202
00:11:04,341 --> 00:11:06,680
a lot of room for advancement and 
improvement,

203
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,543
we think that this really is a time in 
history when we should all be feeling 

204
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,203
rather positive,
but that's our opinion at visual 

205
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,641
politic.
Ams.

206
00:11:13,641 --> 00:11:15,260
Now we would like to know what you 
think.

207
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,660
Do you Believe we are moving towards a 
better world?

208
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,930
Do you think that asia can be a land of 
opportunity for businesses?

209
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,910
well,
