1
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:12,050
Why are some countries rich and others 
pour?

2
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:13,820
I mean,
it sounds like an easy question,

3
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:15,890
but nothing could be further from the 
truth.

4
00:00:15,891 --> 00:00:19,250
There in fact is the origin of wealth is
one of the key issues.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,610
If north of the most important issue in 
political debates,

6
00:00:22,700 --> 00:00:26,300
they're three and a half million more 
women living in poverty today,

7
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:29,660
the one that president took office.
We don't have to live like this.

8
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,793
I want to give middleclass families and 
folks who were striving to give the 

9
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:35,210
middle class some leaf,

10
00:00:35,380 --> 00:00:38,050
all the poor countries poor because 
there are rich countries.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,903
Do the richest countries have any 
special geographical characteristics 

12
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,900
that determine their success?
Oh,

13
00:00:43,901 --> 00:00:46,360
natural resources for source of wealth,
ah,

14
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:49,510
their inhabitants smarter or most 
importantly of all,

15
00:00:49,511 --> 00:00:53,890
is there some limited amount of wealth 
that we simply have to distribute?

16
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:55,733
What does,

17
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:05,903
if you,
if the answer to all of those questions 

18
00:01:07,391 --> 00:01:08,224
was a yes,
then we could say that our luckiest set 

19
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:13,270
and we simply can't change it.
If we're rich,

20
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:14,680
great,
and if we're poor,

21
00:01:14,681 --> 00:01:15,514
apparently there are only two paths.
Either we quits or we put our trust in 

22
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:24,370
some sorts of Messianic leader who 
promises us some kinds of revolution.

23
00:01:24,430 --> 00:01:25,810
Of course,
these revolutions,

24
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:28,750
well,
they almost always ends up making things

25
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:29,860
much worse.

26
00:01:30,030 --> 00:01:34,470
[inaudible] Rico said,
I know,

27
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:35,950
but just all during my mind,

28
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:39,320
I actually think that this approach is 
missing something melt.

29
00:01:39,321 --> 00:01:41,020
Honestly,
I think it's missing rather,

30
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,680
and lots of things.
Obviously folks,

31
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,000
many factors determine whether a country
is rich or whether it is porn,

32
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:50,120
and in this video we're going to focus 
on one of the factors.

33
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,013
In fact,
probably one of the most important 

34
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:55,850
issues of all,
we'll will do so by taking a look at the

35
00:01:55,851 --> 00:01:58,460
history of the entire American 
continent.

36
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,520
So listen up America versus America.

37
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:09,970
Okay.

38
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:13,180
America one consonance,
two very different realities.

39
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:16,780
Some countries are very rich and others 
very poor.

40
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:19,780
For example,
check out Canada's park capita income,

41
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,190
even taking a price difference into 
account.

42
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:25,600
It is five times that of El Salvador or 
Ecuador.

43
00:02:25,690 --> 00:02:26,523
Then consider the fact that the per 
capita income in the U S is four times 

44
00:02:29,770 --> 00:02:31,540
higher than it is in Columbia.
Yes,

45
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:32,374
it's true.
And there's also a group of countries 

46
00:02:33,311 --> 00:02:36,970
that we could describe in relative terms
as sort of middle class.

47
00:02:36,971 --> 00:02:37,804
We've got Chili and Panama.
The income is three times that of 

48
00:02:40,451 --> 00:02:43,450
Bolivia and almost double that of Peru.

49
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:48,410
Okay.

50
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:49,243
Broadly speaking,
of the 1 billion people living in the 

51
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:52,394
America is approximately 40% lift in 
some of the richest countries in the 

52
00:02:55,731 --> 00:02:58,460
world,
mainly the United States and Canada.

53
00:02:58,520 --> 00:02:59,353
Meanwhile,
the other 60% of Americans live in 

54
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:06,421
countries that are either very poor or 
are still developing and of course faced

55
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,680
with this panorama.
The question is,

56
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:12,573
why on earth is there such a contrast 
between for two great North American 

57
00:03:16,691 --> 00:03:20,980
powers under the rest of the consonants 
or even why are the countries located at

58
00:03:20,981 --> 00:03:23,150
both ends of the continents?
January richer?

59
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,670
Well,
just check out this map.

60
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,280
The countries that are painted with a 
darker color,

61
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:28,653
Richard.

62
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:32,350
Okay.

63
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,183
However,
it may be easier to notice the enormous 

64
00:03:35,591 --> 00:03:36,424
difference writes on the board of that.
You're seeing donald trump's favorite 

65
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:39,970
border,
of course,

66
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:45,060
the one between the United States and 
Mexico on the north side of the border.

67
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:50,290
We do have the u s one of the wealthiest
countries in the world.

68
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,183
I come three where in general its 
inhabitants are much richer and it's 

69
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:54,884
much safer and they live longer lives 
than those on the southern side of the 

70
00:03:58,421 --> 00:04:00,580
border.
Those who live in Mexico,

71
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,630
in fact one crosses the border and 
suddenly everything changes.

72
00:04:04,631 --> 00:04:05,464
Right.

73
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:07,350
Bye.

74
00:04:07,350 --> 00:04:09,120
Why such a difference?
Well,

75
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:09,954
because at the end of the day we're 
talking about territories that have a 

76
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:15,840
very similar population and its natural 
resources.

77
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:19,020
Don't forget that much of California,
Texas and New Mexico,

78
00:04:19,021 --> 00:04:22,200
some of these states,
which by the way are the most prosperous

79
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:23,034
and innovative in the United States when
Mexican at the beginning of the 19th 

80
00:04:26,431 --> 00:04:27,264
century.

81
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:28,890
Okay.

82
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:29,723
Yeah.
And the people that you manage to cross 

83
00:04:30,421 --> 00:04:31,254
from south of the border to the north 
have quite high employment and 

84
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:34,794
entrepreneurship rates.
So of course we're not talking about 

85
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:39,070
racial or religious motives.
Yeah.

86
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:45,680
Then why on earth does this huge 
contrast exist between the north and the

87
00:04:45,681 --> 00:04:47,000
south of the border?
Well,

88
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,420
you might be thinking right now that 
obviously it's because they've had worse

89
00:04:50,421 --> 00:04:53,150
governments and worse politicians,
but I mean,

90
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:54,013
where did that come from?
Did almost all the countries south of 

91
00:04:56,451 --> 00:05:00,260
the u s Mexico border just simply have 
this sort of bad luck?

92
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:03,020
Is that not another factor involved?
Well,

93
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:08,080
listen up here,
different destinations Devi,

94
00:05:11,121 --> 00:05:14,510
you are to continue in the video today,
we really need to take a small trip.

95
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,890
We need to go back to the year 1600 
imagine there are two brothers,

96
00:05:18,891 --> 00:05:20,940
John and his pizza who,
or a balanced,

97
00:05:20,941 --> 00:05:25,070
we embark on the American adventure from
some European pause.

98
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,120
However,
due to fate,

99
00:05:26,150 --> 00:05:27,560
they ended up on different books.

100
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:29,870
Okay?

101
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:32,810
One of the brothers,
John left in such a fortune in Mexico,

102
00:05:32,811 --> 00:05:33,644
while pizza got on a ship that was 
heading farther north to what later 

103
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:39,440
became known as New England's and today 
corresponds to the states.

104
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:40,720
If New Hampshire,
Connecticut,

105
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,900
Massachusetts,
Vermont,

106
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:43,220
Maine,
and Rhode Island.

107
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,233
Okay?

108
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:46,093
And you might be picking it up now,
but this is indeed one of the richest 

109
00:05:48,321 --> 00:05:50,030
areas in the United States.
Now,

110
00:05:50,031 --> 00:05:50,864
the question is,
if you'd been in these two brothers 

111
00:05:52,401 --> 00:05:54,710
places,
which ship would you have preferred?

112
00:05:54,711 --> 00:05:58,670
The one that was going to Mexico or the 
one that was to New England's to Boston?

113
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,960
Well,
viewer,

114
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:00,853
for those of you who answered Boston,
I think you should rather reconsider 

115
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:05,084
your decision at the time.
Things they couldn't have been more 

116
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,090
different.
You see,

117
00:06:08,091 --> 00:06:10,130
John,
he arrived in Mexico City,

118
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,380
a city full of monuments in new 
buildings,

119
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:15,920
a city that had nothing to envy from 
European cities,

120
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:18,273
but that's how I'm,
Mexico was part of the vice royalty of 

121
00:06:20,271 --> 00:06:22,880
new Spain,
an area of expensive governance that was

122
00:06:22,881 --> 00:06:24,860
full of wonders,
cultivated fields,

123
00:06:24,861 --> 00:06:27,920
ancient civilization ruins large cities,
et Cetera,

124
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:31,790
et cetera.
But Peta,

125
00:06:31,860 --> 00:06:33,800
he arrived in a cold,
desolate,

126
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,053
unpopulated area,
a place without infrastructure where 

127
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:39,920
mere survival was something of a 
challenge.

128
00:06:39,950 --> 00:06:42,530
It was a place where real hunger and 
true cold,

129
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,393
we're raging.
Actually the Spanish conquerors didn't 

130
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:48,110
move further north because there was no 
wealth to extract that

131
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:52,820
chose North America.
Not because it was attractive,

132
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,410
but because it was all that was 
available,

133
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,273
but desirable parts of the Americas 
where the indigenous population to 

134
00:06:57,891 --> 00:06:58,724
exploit was plentiful and where the gold
and silver mines were located had 

135
00:07:02,151 --> 00:07:05,480
already been occupied.
The English got the leftovers,

136
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,311
Darren,
Asimo,

137
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:09,770
Lou and James Robinson.
Why nations fail

138
00:07:09,850 --> 00:07:10,683
in New England,
one how to work very hard just to 

139
00:07:12,611 --> 00:07:17,510
survive in the south.
However things they were difference,

140
00:07:17,511 --> 00:07:18,344
there were many natural riches.
The climate's was much better for 

141
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:21,494
agriculture and so there was a large 
local population used by the Spanish 

142
00:07:24,411 --> 00:07:25,244
conquistadores to do endless hours of 
work in exchange for practically 

143
00:07:28,551 --> 00:07:29,384
nothing.

144
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,490
The fact is that all of these resources,
man,

145
00:07:33,491 --> 00:07:37,680
so that many of those who arrived didn't
have to work in order to survive,

146
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:40,620
and not only that,
many of the institutions that existed in

147
00:07:40,621 --> 00:07:41,454
old Europe could be easily replicated.
These were institutions like the 

148
00:07:44,581 --> 00:07:45,414
aristocracy and bureaucracy.
That is the officials or the royal 

149
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:49,584
favors,
which were privileges granted by the 

150
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:53,310
state and to which benefits is only a 
select few.

151
00:07:53,311 --> 00:07:55,210
These include things like commercial 
monopolies,

152
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:56,610
land distribution,
mining,

153
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:58,170
exploitation,
et cetera.

154
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,760
That way.
That's all by Lisel.

155
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:00,623
On the one hand,
a culture was born in which work and 

156
00:08:02,941 --> 00:08:03,774
entrepreneurship.
We're not perceived as the best way to 

157
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,110
prospect.
Instead,

158
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:07,944
people just needed to make good 
connections with those who were in 

159
00:08:10,201 --> 00:08:11,011
power.
I mean,

160
00:08:11,011 --> 00:08:11,844
why risk investing when you can just 
hold out your hand for a handout and 

161
00:08:14,071 --> 00:08:14,904
then on the other hands in elite class 
was formed by people who lived based on 

162
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,820
the resources that others extracted.
They lived through privileges,

163
00:08:20,821 --> 00:08:22,860
forced exploitation of the natives,
lans,

164
00:08:22,861 --> 00:08:24,390
distribution,
concessions,

165
00:08:24,391 --> 00:08:25,890
public revenues,
taxes,

166
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:26,783
et cetera.

167
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,700
This was an elite class by the way,
which based on the standards of the time

168
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,563
lived at full speed,
which meant having to extract more and 

169
00:08:36,091 --> 00:08:36,924
more resources from the others.
This meant that this elite group that's 

170
00:08:39,271 --> 00:08:41,520
controlled the economic resources not 
only to,

171
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:44,970
didn't have to worry about investing,
innovating or taking risks,

172
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:50,000
they actually placed obstacles for other
people and give you this culture.

173
00:08:51,810 --> 00:08:52,643
It didn't disappear with independence.
It simply remains consolidating some of 

174
00:08:55,741 --> 00:09:00,270
the most remarkable characteristics of 
Latin America and elite class with a lot

175
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:02,940
of wealth that is based on obtaining 
wrens overlords,

176
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:06,150
a lot of bureaucracy,
and they shattered social elevator.

177
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,380
Meanwhile,
in the north,

178
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:09,960
things were going completely 
differently.

179
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,400
The survival

180
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,710
unlike was happens in the south of the 
north,

181
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,950
had no resources and no indigenous 
population to exploit it,

182
00:09:25,970 --> 00:09:28,590
so there was no other option,
but to work hard,

183
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:32,120
invest and innovate in order to improve 
the standard of living.

184
00:09:32,121 --> 00:09:32,954
Yeah.
Thus the social climate and the 

185
00:09:35,251 --> 00:09:37,290
institutions that were developed were 
very,

186
00:09:37,291 --> 00:09:41,100
very different.
Physical hard work was well regarded and

187
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,023
not only that,
because since these territories were 

188
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:48,120
very poor and practically depopulated,
they had a lot of political and economic

189
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:51,710
autonomy.
Actually at first,

190
00:09:51,711 --> 00:09:54,410
the British crown didn't really care 
much about these colonies.

191
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,273
They were more concerned about what was 
happening in other parts of the empire 

192
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,810
where things were more lucrative.
In fact,

193
00:09:59,811 --> 00:10:00,644
it was only when these colonies begins a
prosper that the crown that started to 

194
00:10:02,691 --> 00:10:03,524
pay attention to them.
This means that the crown began to 

195
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:09,380
establish political and economic 
controls as well as introduced taxes.

196
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,273
And as we all know,
the settlers didn't take that lying 

197
00:10:12,021 --> 00:10:12,854
down.
Yeah.

198
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,390
Okay.

199
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:16,223
See,
it's often said that the u s war of 

200
00:10:17,461 --> 00:10:19,980
independence was a fight to obtain 
freedom.

201
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:20,873
However many of the incentives that led 
them to fight it more to do with 

202
00:10:23,371 --> 00:10:24,204
maintaining the freedom,
but they were already used to and which 

203
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,190
they were no longer willing to give up

204
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,233
once they obtained their independence.
They worried a lot about making sure 

205
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:41,150
that neither of their liberties nor that
entrepreneurial capacities were at risk.

206
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,040
But some of you might be thinking right 
now,

207
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:43,874
well Simon,
hold on a minute because the offer 

208
00:10:45,411 --> 00:10:47,180
guessing about slavery.
Well,

209
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:49,580
actually I'm not because the slave 
states,

210
00:10:49,610 --> 00:10:50,443
they weren't actually the richest 
slavery enriched a few at the great 

211
00:10:53,811 --> 00:10:55,730
expense of others.
Of course,

212
00:10:55,750 --> 00:10:56,583
if instead we talked about two companies
instead of two brothers in the long 

213
00:10:59,471 --> 00:11:01,610
term,
it would have been much better to invest

214
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:04,190
in the one in Boston.
The keys to development.

215
00:11:04,191 --> 00:11:05,024
They don't lie in the natural resources 
of a country or in the exploitation of 

216
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:10,850
anyone.
They lie in ingenuity,

217
00:11:10,910 --> 00:11:12,890
entrepreneurial spirit,
and in work.

218
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:15,950
That's why when politicians make this 
process difficult,

219
00:11:15,951 --> 00:11:17,570
for example,
with taxes,

220
00:11:17,571 --> 00:11:18,404
a strong state,
lots of bureaucracy or privileges for 

221
00:11:20,691 --> 00:11:21,524
their friends,
the results that are always really bad 

222
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:25,063
in a way,
it's similar to what happens with the 

223
00:11:26,601 --> 00:11:31,601
natural resources.
They can help,

224
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:36,090
but they aren't enough to generate real 
wealth because they're all very rich.

225
00:11:36,091 --> 00:11:36,924
Countries that hardly have any natural 
resources like Japan or Singapore and 

226
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:44,690
others with many resources but are 
incredibly poor like Venezuela.

227
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:47,700
Ingenuity,
work and capital are more important than

228
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,080
any natural resource.

229
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,140
Good.
The good news

230
00:11:51,140 --> 00:11:52,820
here is that poverty,
it's not,

231
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,303
and you can't escape it.
Trajectories such as those seen in 

232
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,484
countries like Chile or Panama or in 
recent decades showing with that things 

233
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:03,230
absolutely can change,
but always the,

234
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:07,420
and do you think we'll soon see an 
economic takeoff in Latin America?

235
00:12:07,450 --> 00:12:08,283
