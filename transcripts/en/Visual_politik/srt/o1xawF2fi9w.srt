1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,910
Have you ever wondered how a country can
be hijacked,

2
00:00:02,911 --> 00:00:03,744
how institutions can be subjective,
averted and corrupted and perhaps most 

3
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:10,260
importantly,
how do you identify the moments in which

4
00:00:10,261 --> 00:00:13,050
a democracy after being taken over stops
working?

5
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,290
Their view of those questions have 
pervaded global politics,

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,620
butts especially they've pervaded Latin 
American politics.

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:20,793
I can do that here on my needs.
He has been put in my name [inaudible] 

8
00:00:32,380 --> 00:00:33,820
and peanut butter on it.

9
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:45,290
Yeah.
Put me at Moz.

10
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:46,563
Okay.

11
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:50,943
Last few decades,
numerous last and American leaders of 

12
00:00:52,541 --> 00:00:56,920
taking control of their countries.
Sometimes they did it through Kuda Taz,

13
00:00:56,921 --> 00:00:57,754
but in many other occasions these 
dictators came to power through 

14
00:01:00,101 --> 00:01:04,530
democratic means.
That is precisely the case of Nicaraguan

15
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:06,610
President Daniel or Tayga.

16
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:08,573
Okay.

17
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:10,953
Visual policy.
We've already told you about this 

18
00:01:12,341 --> 00:01:14,200
political figure,
how he came to power,

19
00:01:14,201 --> 00:01:15,034
how he behaved and how he was 
responsible for the huge strikes that 

20
00:01:17,591 --> 00:01:20,650
Nicaragua has been going through in 2018

21
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:25,333
yeah.

22
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,163
Strikes that have been answered with a 
heavy hands and which have led to 

23
00:01:35,351 --> 00:01:36,184
terrible consequences.
More than 200 people have lost their 

24
00:01:38,861 --> 00:01:40,690
lives.
Hundreds have been detained.

25
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:42,910
Thousands have been injured.
Well,

26
00:01:42,911 --> 00:01:43,744
in this video,
we're going to take a look at another 

27
00:01:45,701 --> 00:01:47,560
aspect of the events.
Yes.

28
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,460
This is the story of how a government's 
managed to take control of the state and

29
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:53,860
make the institutions work,
not for the country,

30
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:54,723
but for itself.
This is the story of how I kinds of 

31
00:01:57,371 --> 00:02:00,490
political Matthia took control of 
Nicaragua,

32
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:02,050
so listen up.

33
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,793
Yeah,

34
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:12,053
yeah.
It's 2006 and Daniel Ortega winds the 

35
00:02:14,411 --> 00:02:18,810
Nicaraguan presidential elections after 
16 years as the opposition,

36
00:02:18,830 --> 00:02:20,830
the Sandinista leader returns to the 
country,

37
00:02:20,831 --> 00:02:22,420
his presidency,
the precedents,

38
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,170
what exactly good.
His first time as president between 1985

39
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,320
and 1990 was frankly terrible.
I'll tell you,

40
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,270
go left and economically and socially.
It shattered country.

41
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:40,163
It was a company that went through a 
warm ended up with a foreign debt six 

42
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:46,230
times bigger than its GDP and suffered 
from hyperinflation that are reached the

43
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,064
astronomical figure of 33.547%
by 1987 to give you an idea of the 

44
00:02:52,471 --> 00:02:53,304
magnitude of this disaster,
in 1990 the per capita income of 

45
00:02:56,161 --> 00:02:56,994
Nicaragua was 55% smaller than the 
country he had registered back in 1978 

46
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:04,390
in other words,
compared to Daniel Ortega,

47
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:09,420
even the kushners would get good grades.
Ortega's economic model.

48
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:17,710
It was a huge failure.
The expropriations,

49
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:18,544
the gigantic foreign debt,
the unstoppable money printing and his 

50
00:03:22,241 --> 00:03:23,074
obsession with controlling the economy 
led Nicaragua into an unsustainable 

51
00:03:27,461 --> 00:03:28,600
situation.
Hands,

52
00:03:28,601 --> 00:03:31,390
I mean,
how wouldn't it of with that recipe,

53
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,910
we has the conscious conflict to all of 
this financed by the United States.

54
00:03:41,911 --> 00:03:45,870
The country was submerged in a complete 
disaster.

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,533
Bye,

56
00:03:54,690 --> 00:03:56,230
right?
For those of you who don't know,

57
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,064
the contracts were paramilitary groups 
financed by Washington through selling 

58
00:04:00,011 --> 00:04:03,040
weapons to Iran.
When this country was in the middle of a

59
00:04:03,041 --> 00:04:03,874
walk with Iraq,
a country that was supposedly close to 

60
00:04:06,131 --> 00:04:08,950
Washington in shorts,
lots of nonsense.

61
00:04:08,980 --> 00:04:09,813
So throughout the following decades,
the country only out of one initiative 

62
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,150
that was simply to recover from this 
hideous mess.

63
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:17,743
See

64
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,090
this,
the following government,

65
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:32,790
starting with that a violator tomorrow,
by the way,

66
00:04:32,791 --> 00:04:33,624
the first elected female Latin American 
president decided to turn the country's 

67
00:04:37,411 --> 00:04:38,244
political and economic approach right 
around that is to move from a 

68
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,324
centralized economy,
which was organized and directed by the 

69
00:04:45,091 --> 00:04:46,220
state to a market.

70
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:52,550
Got It.

71
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:58,560
Salvey Nicaragua and free trade zones 
were born now as well as the policies do

72
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,453
attract foreign investments,
which along with international 

73
00:05:01,591 --> 00:05:02,424
cooperation and especially the growing 
remittances from abroad allowed to 

74
00:05:05,311 --> 00:05:10,311
Nicaragua to get back on track.
Hold on just a moment because what these

75
00:05:21,431 --> 00:05:25,840
new governments didn't achieve was 
putting an end to corruption.

76
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,110
Thus scandal after scans all the feeling
of frustration,

77
00:05:29,111 --> 00:05:29,944
disappointment,
and deceit that all Nicaraguans fells 

78
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,770
along with an opposition who was willing
to do almost anything to return to power

79
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:40,800
fueled Ortega's victory in 2006 here few
s is where the new story begins,

80
00:05:50,631 --> 00:05:54,400
especially because all Tayga wasn't 
going to waste as returned to power.

81
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:58,890
This was his charms.
This was his to dominate in Nicaragua,

82
00:05:58,891 --> 00:06:01,190
in politics,
finances and society,

83
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,053
but to achieve this and above all to 
prevent an electoral process from Maria 

84
00:06:05,781 --> 00:06:06,614
evicting him from the presidency.
He needed to seize political power with 

85
00:06:09,261 --> 00:06:10,094
an armed force and an economic monopoly.
This as the strategy he set in motion 

86
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,850
and the steps he took to achieve his 
purpose,

87
00:06:17,070 --> 00:06:17,903
sort of listening,

88
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,170
political power,

89
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,913
obviously his strategy,
his first goal was to achieve political 

90
00:06:31,561 --> 00:06:34,860
hegemony and social control by any means
necessary.

91
00:06:34,861 --> 00:06:35,694
This was very clear to Ortega from the 
beginning and he launched a double 

92
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:39,773
tactic to achieve it fast by invading 
the institutions and centralizing power 

93
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,150
and then my limiting and intimidating 
the opposition,

94
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:51,210
something for which fear is usually a 
very,

95
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,770
very effective ingredients.
Shortly after arriving Ortega launch day

96
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:58,200
paramilitary force composed of gang 
members.

97
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,093
We're talking about shock and groups 
better known in Nicaragua as the 

98
00:07:01,711 --> 00:07:02,544
toddlers.

99
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:05,510
They are feared and the people call them
mobs.

100
00:07:05,600 --> 00:07:06,433
They usually wear tee shirts that speak 
of love and peace wear helmets to hide 

101
00:07:09,591 --> 00:07:10,424
their faces and move on motorcycles.
They're mostly very violent young 

102
00:07:14,751 --> 00:07:18,080
people.
[inaudible] journalists in Managua.

103
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,490
It's objective.
Well,

104
00:07:19,491 --> 00:07:20,324
I would be too intimidated to the 
political opposition to frighten those 

105
00:07:22,781 --> 00:07:23,614
who disagree with the government and to 
try and dismantle the opposition's 

106
00:07:26,441 --> 00:07:29,770
demonstrations or concentrations with 
violence.

107
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:30,663
Obviously it isn't an official forests,
but they have the government's 

108
00:07:33,401 --> 00:07:37,130
protection and we're going to see how 
that works in just a moment.

109
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,893
Say that a para military force has been 
set up in Nicaragua that is composed of 

110
00:07:42,291 --> 00:07:45,540
gang members,
but sometimes we get on a bus and a para

111
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,410
military member is watching us 
[inaudible] Castillo,

112
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:49,760
Nicaraguan activist,

113
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:54,580
but of course it doesn't end here.
The next step to achieve total political

114
00:07:54,581 --> 00:07:58,480
control is to take control of the state 
institutions as well.

115
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,830
How do you think he did that?

116
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,153
Well

117
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:10,440
first political decentralization to be 
ended,

118
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,363
in this case,
municipal autonomy thus in Nicaragua or 

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,880
Tayga is political henchmen has managed 
to dismiss mayors at will.

120
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:19,020
Something like,
Hey,

121
00:08:19,021 --> 00:08:21,660
if you've got a political arrive,
I'll just kick him out of the race.

122
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:23,640
That way you don't need to get rid of 
your opponents.

123
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:28,050
You also win loyal fans who of course 
don't want to risk making him out.

124
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:29,063
Right?
The second step to institutional 

125
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:39,040
takeover was do create ans or legitimize
his own political organizations.

126
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,190
In this case,
the citizen power councils,

127
00:08:42,220 --> 00:08:46,300
these bodies which supposedly involved 
community participation in practice have

128
00:08:46,301 --> 00:08:47,134
the objective of creating a parallel 
political structure that is recognized 

129
00:08:50,771 --> 00:08:52,780
and controlled by the government.

130
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:55,803
I'm the feds

131
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:56,370
appoints

132
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,203
and achieve the indefinite permanence of
his party associates in every key state 

133
00:09:01,651 --> 00:09:03,360
position.
The electoral power,

134
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:04,253
the judicial power ends,
the general control that and different 

135
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,973
official protests.
I mean that's what those moms is a four 

136
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,793
right?
So how about two examples of proving 

137
00:09:12,661 --> 00:09:15,360
what Ortega achieved with this strategy?
Well,

138
00:09:15,390 --> 00:09:16,223
check this out.

139
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,893
One ends.
The Nicaraguan Constitution prohibited 

140
00:09:24,611 --> 00:09:26,650
the consecutive reelection of the 
president,

141
00:09:26,651 --> 00:09:29,680
so I'll tell you go would've completed 
his turn and 2001

142
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:30,533
11

143
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,803
as Hernandez did in on drs or Tayga and 
managed to get to the Constitutional 

144
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:39,713
Chamber of the Supreme Court,
composed mostly of Sandinista 

145
00:09:40,831 --> 00:09:44,520
magistrates stupid declared article one 
four seven as in applicable,

146
00:09:44,550 --> 00:09:45,383
which is the one that prevented the 
presidential consecutive reelection in 

147
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:49,860
exchange.
Yup.

148
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:53,610
Theme Magistrates positions were insured
for life.

149
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,700
Quite the exchange.
On the other hand,

150
00:09:58,770 --> 00:09:59,603
in 2011 fraud suspicions were so intense
that both the European Union and the 

151
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:05,993
Organization of American States 
concluded that they weren't sure if the 

152
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:08,010
results,
you know,

153
00:10:08,011 --> 00:10:11,310
you controlled the electoral power.
Yes it would be,

154
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,144
or tag or,
and he made sure that his followers 

155
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:16,860
could do and undo whatever they wanted.
In fact,

156
00:10:16,861 --> 00:10:19,440
in the following elections,
the 2016 ones,

157
00:10:19,441 --> 00:10:23,640
they didn't even split and the ruling 
party took full control of the process.

158
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:25,500
But hold on a moment.
You might be thinking,

159
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:28,080
I mean it wasn't there a big scandal 
because of the Simon.

160
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,973
Well,
let's say that the president had made 

161
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:34,030
sure that practically every major media 
station in the country,

162
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:36,780
it was controlled by his family of their
associates.

163
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:38,640
You're taking

164
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:39,473
a family monopolizes the media in 
Nicaragua mobs and the occupation of 

165
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:45,750
institutions and the media,
well,

166
00:10:45,751 --> 00:10:50,751
this is the political side,
but this much more the force monopoly as

167
00:10:59,311 --> 00:11:01,410
cool as much as he holds political 
power.

168
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,780
If a dictator,
it doesn't hold the military force,

169
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:07,530
he's taking a huge risk.
This was very clear to our protagonists.

170
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,140
Say these seconds.
Pillar of this strategy was to take over

171
00:11:10,141 --> 00:11:10,974
the police and to take over the army.
Did he say he took advantage of his 

172
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:17,514
majority in the National Assembly as 
soon as he got into power or take your 

173
00:11:20,270 --> 00:11:21,103
push to reform that place,
the ability to appoint new faculties of 

174
00:11:23,641 --> 00:11:27,210
the National Police and the army of the 
republic in his hands.

175
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:30,960
Then taking advantage of these new 
possibilities.

176
00:11:30,961 --> 00:11:31,794
He placed relatives and loyal people 
[inaudible] in charge of these 

177
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,210
institutions.
For example,

178
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,110
the police aren't directed by his own 
father in law Francisco Diaz.

179
00:11:40,140 --> 00:11:42,060
This means you can get the police to 
look the other way.

180
00:11:42,061 --> 00:11:42,881
When the mob,
Zach,

181
00:11:42,881 --> 00:11:45,240
since when the opposition strikes,
repression,

182
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:46,283
repression,
well more repression because when the 

183
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,660
mafia holds the power,
it's not easy for them to let go.

184
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:57,370
Well,
we've covered politics and we've covered

185
00:11:57,371 --> 00:11:58,204
force,
but there's still a third element 

186
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:00,454
missing

187
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,950
economic power.

188
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:09,120
Yeah.

189
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,990
Pillar in the strategy was to achieve 
economic power for three reasons.

190
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,853
First to prevent in Nicaragua and 
capital from supporting an alternative 

191
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:21,090
seconds to get resources with which to 
carry out Ortega's plans and third,

192
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:23,700
perhaps the most important points to 
fill his pockets,

193
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:31,220
less time.
It corruption has been brutal to such an

194
00:12:31,221 --> 00:12:34,610
extent that the Ortega Morello family a 
million as see,

195
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,000
they've taken over the media,
they hold high positions in the states.

196
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:42,410
They've even taken over oil important 
distributions in Nicaragua.

197
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,660
They put themselves in charge of the 
investments,

198
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:48,440
promotion agencies with a plan that we 
could describe like this,

199
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,720
wanting to invest in Nicaragua.
Great.

200
00:12:50,750 --> 00:12:53,030
We'll make it happen,
but you have to give me,

201
00:12:53,031 --> 00:12:54,980
I can mention,
you know for the country,

202
00:12:55,010 --> 00:12:55,843
they've also reached agreements with 
businessmen apparently by getting 

203
00:12:58,911 --> 00:13:02,330
loyalty and envelopes in exchange for 
privileges.

204
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:06,313
Your example,
all of this way of doing things was the 

205
00:13:07,701 --> 00:13:08,534
agreements made.
She builds the interracial Yannick 

206
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:13,220
canal,
seemingly unsuccessful projects in which

207
00:13:13,221 --> 00:13:16,290
the government reached an under the 
table agreement with [inaudible],

208
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,353
the Chinese developer working on it.
First thea state kept half of the 

209
00:13:20,391 --> 00:13:23,990
profits since then with a last minute 
change it became 1%

210
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:24,923
it's

211
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,143
we as Lenny,
the businessmen did some last minute 

212
00:13:28,801 --> 00:13:33,090
haggling in short their viewer.
The factors that with political power,

213
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:35,520
with brute force and with economic 
power.

214
00:13:35,521 --> 00:13:36,354
Daniel Ortega became the owner and Lord 
of Nicaragua and also a billionaire and 

215
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:45,780
just in case in the last election in 
2016 he presented Rosario Marillo.

216
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,673
His wife has vice presidents,
so everything certainly stays in the 

217
00:13:49,861 --> 00:13:50,160
family

218
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:50,993
late.

219
00:13:55,350 --> 00:13:57,890
This is essentially the same thing that 
happens in Venezuela.

220
00:13:57,950 --> 00:14:00,920
It is so to speak,
the manual for a dictator.

221
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,813
And the question we can ask ourselves 
now is can we really pretends that 

222
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:07,250
Nicaragua or is still a democracy?
