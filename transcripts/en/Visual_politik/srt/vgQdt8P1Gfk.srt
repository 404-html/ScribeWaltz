1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:05,180
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:08,623
the alliance between the United States 
and the European countries is not 

3
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:14,630
exactly having its best moments right 
now.

4
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:15,523
Donald Trump has made quite an inference
and as jeopardize the relationship of 

5
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:22,340
these nations who an extent that they 
could even possibly break up.

6
00:00:22,341 --> 00:00:24,800
We have seen that with the Paris 
agreement,

7
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:25,753
make our planet great the game and also 
with Donald Trump's position towards 

8
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:31,934
NATO,
the most powerful military organization 

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,950
in history and I never asked watch what 
the new NATO headquarters cost.

10
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:43,543
I refuse to do that.
In this video we're going to focus on 

11
00:00:46,041 --> 00:00:46,874
this organization.
We're going to look at what's happening 

12
00:00:48,621 --> 00:00:51,230
with Neato,
why Donald Trump is criticizing.

13
00:00:51,231 --> 00:00:54,740
It's so much and what the future is for 
this organization,

14
00:00:54,770 --> 00:00:58,460
but before we get into any of that,
let's get some perspective.

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:01,903
NATO,

16
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:03,823
I'll look back

17
00:01:06,010 --> 00:01:10,240
shortly after the ends of World War Two,
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,

18
00:01:10,241 --> 00:01:11,074
it took its first steps.
It was born in 1949 with a very clear 

19
00:01:14,381 --> 00:01:15,580
mission,
restrain,

20
00:01:15,610 --> 00:01:17,170
stop,
and if needed,

21
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,033
defeat the Soviet Union.
The Cold War had just started and there 

22
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:21,514
was an atmosphere of tension.
The Berlin blockade is already taking 

23
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:27,710
place in the Czech Communist Party,
had completely taking control with acute

24
00:01:27,740 --> 00:01:29,290
attack.
At that time,

25
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:31,290
nobody knew what was going to happen.
The Ans,

26
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,060
the possibility of war was very,
very real.

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:36,310
So let's take a look at the historical 
context.

28
00:01:36,311 --> 00:01:38,770
The world had just gone through World 
War Two.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:43,360
Europe was destroyed and there was an 
absolute distrust on both sides.

30
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:44,223
The truth is the door wouldn't have been
a surprise and that was the situation 

31
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:48,970
which existed when NATO was born.

32
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:50,970
At the beginning,

33
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,320
NATO was formed by the United States,
Canada,

34
00:01:53,321 --> 00:01:55,600
and 10 European countries,
France,

35
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:56,920
Italy,
the United Kingdom,

36
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,210
Belgium,
the Netherlands,

37
00:01:58,270 --> 00:01:59,380
Luxembourg,
Denmark,

38
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:00,490
Norway,
Iceland,

39
00:02:00,491 --> 00:02:02,140
and portrait.
A few years later,

40
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:05,400
the federal public of Germany or western
Germany was added to that.

41
00:02:06,870 --> 00:02:09,090
The general purpose of the idea,
a bit spirits,

42
00:02:09,091 --> 00:02:11,370
so to speak,
was to bring it forces together.

43
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,720
If a man become,
she was attacked.

44
00:02:12,721 --> 00:02:15,660
It was seen as if all the members had 
been attacked as well.

45
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:17,730
Over 101 for all,
right?

46
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,020
Well,
yes,

47
00:02:19,021 --> 00:02:22,470
but also not quite because there was 
quite and lots of small prints.

48
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,690
NATO after the colon.

49
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,450
However,
that all changed in 1991 the fall of the

50
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,840
Soviet Union left Neato with no clear 
Parvis without an enemy.

51
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:44,830
What is the point of the alliance?
That is a question many people asked and

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:45,693
many still do today,
but wait one second because against all 

53
00:02:49,001 --> 00:02:49,834
odds,
it was actually after the fall of the 

54
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,510
Soviet Union that the organization 
started to play a more active role.

55
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,570
It is

56
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:02,970
take an action quite frequently since 
then.

57
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,250
It's includes Serbia,
Kosovo,

58
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,720
Afghanistan,
Libya,

59
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,653
control over the Baltic Sea.
It gets piracy and the Indian Ocean and 

60
00:03:10,051 --> 00:03:12,690
recently support for the fight against 
Isis

61
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,463
was also during this time when more new 
countries that signed up since it 

62
00:03:17,681 --> 00:03:19,570
started in corporations have been 
regular,

63
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:23,420
but since 1991 in corporations have 
really sped up.

64
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:25,340
1949

65
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,173
there were 12 countries in NATO.
Today there are 28 many of these 

66
00:03:29,301 --> 00:03:32,300
countries are from the old Warsaw Pact,
a similar thing to NATO,

67
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:33,370
but led by the Soviets

68
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:41,720
hands.
Putin's Russia has never liked that.

69
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,500
In fact of the award of 2008 between 
Russia and Georgia took place,

70
00:03:45,501 --> 00:03:46,334
partly because Georgia wanted to become 
a member of NATO and something similar 

71
00:03:50,451 --> 00:03:51,284
has happened in the Ukraine,
ends after the recent crisis in Ukraine 

72
00:03:54,441 --> 00:03:58,400
and the clash between them and Russia,
NATO seems to have sped up again.

73
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,700
[inaudible]

74
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:14,220
also in 2016 and immediate action force 
was set up.

75
00:04:14,221 --> 00:04:15,054
This is made of 5,000 soldiers capable 
of deploying very quickly and in almost 

76
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:19,703
any place.
The socal audit spearhead force has 

77
00:04:23,301 --> 00:04:28,301
5,000 soldiers that are part of a larger
rapid action force of 40,000 soldiers.

78
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,413
In order to coordinate it's deployments 
via alliance has created since 

79
00:04:31,941 --> 00:04:32,774
September,
2014 eight support headquarters in all 

80
00:04:35,511 --> 00:04:38,360
the countries that used to be under 
Soviet influence.

81
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:40,673
And then 2017 the United States made the
largest troop deployments in Europe 

82
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:47,390
since the Cold War following a NATO 
mission.

83
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,853
Thousands of US troops arrive in Europe 
in one of the largest deployments since 

84
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:53,450
the cold

85
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:54,283
or we all talking about more than 4,000 
soldiers and hundreds of tanks and 

86
00:04:58,611 --> 00:04:59,444
armored vehicles already being deployed 
in eastern Europe on a mission that 

87
00:05:02,691 --> 00:05:03,524
reminds us of the initial mission of 
NATO to discourage Russia from any 

88
00:05:06,651 --> 00:05:08,720
expansionist temptations.
However,

89
00:05:08,750 --> 00:05:09,583
despite all of this activity,
the role of NATO is still uncertain and 

90
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:18,380
the United States is still unhappy with 
the commitments from the organizations.

91
00:05:18,381 --> 00:05:19,430
European partners.

92
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:20,363
Yes.

93
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,440
The anger of the United States.

94
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:27,550
I was saying,
oh,

95
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,383
the Rom the mutual defense guarantee you
if a member of NATO is a tax is not as 

96
00:05:32,181 --> 00:05:35,270
clear as it seems.
Take a look at article five the one that

97
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:38,370
regulates this situation.
Parties

98
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,203
agree that an armed attack against one 
or more of them shall be considered it 

99
00:05:42,261 --> 00:05:46,170
an attack against them all.
And consequently they agree that if such

100
00:05:46,171 --> 00:05:47,004
an attack occurs,
each of them will assist the party or 

101
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:49,914
parties.
So attacked by taking forth with such 

102
00:05:52,471 --> 00:05:56,730
actions as it deems necessary,
including the use of armed force article

103
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,490
five of the North Atlantic Treaty,

104
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,803
including the use of armed forces.
This means the Tipi country were to 

105
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,364
suffer an attack.
It doesn't mean the rest have to give 

106
00:06:06,380 --> 00:06:07,213
immediate military support and that is 
why all of the presidents of the United 

107
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,713
States,
since Harry Truman have taken advantage 

108
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:14,203
of the first NATO meeting they attended 
to in article five as a commitment of 

109
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,490
military force.

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:21,833
Yeah.

111
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,113
How are the Donald Trump hasn't,
he was expected to do so during the 

112
00:06:27,851 --> 00:06:32,140
inauguration of a monument for victims 
of nine 11 in Brussels where he attended

113
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,890
his first meeting meeting.
Indeed,

114
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,610
he was asked to do so by the European 
countries.

115
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:38,320
The White House have said that they 
would,

116
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:41,290
but a final commitment was not 
forthcoming.

117
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,153
There are analysts that think this is a 
major issue and they refer to this as 

118
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:48,070
one of the biggest diplomatic mistakes 
of all time.

119
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:50,110
Other analysts don't think this is so 
important,

120
00:06:50,111 --> 00:06:54,580
but what is undeniable is that this has 
not been well received in Europe,

121
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,220
especially for these reasons.
Yeah,

122
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,400
okay.

123
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,233
Till now,
the only country which is invoked 

124
00:06:59,301 --> 00:07:00,134
article five was the United States.
They did it after nine 11 and they 

125
00:07:02,841 --> 00:07:05,270
received immediate support from all 
members of NATO.

126
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:06,290
Okay.

127
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:07,123
Well thing is that trump didn't want to 
offer support and actually he took 

128
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,250
advantage of his speech.
Do you recrimination the alleged lack of

129
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,160
commitments by his European allies?

130
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:16,530
He

131
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,363
Europeans what?
Dedicating a monument to remember the 

132
00:07:18,891 --> 00:07:19,724
888 European,
158 Canadian and 2,396 American troops 

133
00:07:24,201 --> 00:07:26,870
who died in Afghanistan took some doing 
Thomas,

134
00:07:26,871 --> 00:07:27,704
right?

135
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:28,550
Let's,

136
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:31,340
trump is not the only one angry about 
it.

137
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:33,050
Bama.
He had the same opinion.

138
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:33,973
And the question is now,
why is the United States so angry at 

139
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:37,724
NATO?
Well basically because they claim that 

140
00:07:39,501 --> 00:07:43,560
the European members of NATO on not 
committed enough or don't spend enough

141
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:44,603
money

142
00:07:49,030 --> 00:07:49,863
rule.
All NATO members are committed to 

143
00:07:51,071 --> 00:07:54,670
spending at least 2% of their GDP on 
defense.

144
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,533
However,
only a few countries and meeting this 

145
00:07:57,071 --> 00:07:58,840
commitment,
these include the United Kingdom,

146
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:00,490
Poland,
Sonia Greece,

147
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:01,420
and of course the united,

148
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,153
the rest welfare,
quite some way from spending that 

149
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:07,063
amounts.
Just taking a look at what trump's 

150
00:08:07,871 --> 00:08:08,704
secretary of defense,
James Mattis has to say about the 

151
00:08:10,821 --> 00:08:12,080
European countries.

152
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:16,720
Americans cannot care more for your 
children's future security than you do.

153
00:08:17,350 --> 00:08:18,183
Now wait a second,
because it does this mean that the 

154
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:22,630
European countries don't spend money on 
defense?

155
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,910
Well,
that's certainly not the case.

156
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:25,773
In fact,
if we add up all of the budgets of all 

157
00:08:27,371 --> 00:08:29,440
European countries that are members of 
NATO,

158
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:33,370
these countries spend $250 billion every
year.

159
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,233
So you're with these countries were one,
it would be the country with the second 

160
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:40,870
highest military spending after only the
United States.

161
00:08:40,930 --> 00:08:41,763
So if it's money we're talking about,
it's not that spending has been reduced 

162
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:48,520
or at least not relative to the threats 
of the world is currently facing times.

163
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:49,383
They're pretty different sands.
We don't live with a Soviet Union 

164
00:08:51,821 --> 00:08:52,654
anymore,

165
00:08:56,670 --> 00:08:58,710
and obsession of the United States,

166
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:01,233
let us say it loud and clear.
The world has changed and we are facing 

167
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,004
different difficulties than we were ever
in the 1960s the risk today is not just 

168
00:09:09,430 --> 00:09:10,263
the possibility of a great war.
This risk has been reduced by 

169
00:09:12,791 --> 00:09:16,270
globalization,
trade and mutually assured destruction.

170
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:19,360
The threats we face today can be found 
in terrorism,

171
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:21,050
piracy,
cyber warfare,

172
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,890
am's,
the risk of the proliferation of weapons

173
00:09:23,891 --> 00:09:26,950
of mass destruction.
So must we fight these risks?

174
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:27,843
Well,
certainly this is something that we 

175
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,424
won't accomplish with more tanks.
We also need to consider that we are 

176
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:36,240
dealing with a very different kind of 
water date,

177
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:37,083
something known as hybrid warfare where 
combat isn't like what it was in older 

178
00:09:40,891 --> 00:09:44,920
movies.
Most of the wars are more and more often

179
00:09:44,950 --> 00:09:48,450
about gorillas and as groups aimed at 
destabilizing nations.

180
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:51,520
Other that is political pressure,
economic penalties,

181
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:53,200
cyber warfare,
interference.

182
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,150
In the election processes,
intelligence,

183
00:09:55,151 --> 00:09:56,500
operations,
et Cetera,

184
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,050
et Cetera,
that make wall much more company.

185
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:04,090
Okay.
To the mistakes of Europe,

186
00:10:06,370 --> 00:10:10,240
one thing is clear,
they see numbers on not doing everything

187
00:10:10,241 --> 00:10:11,074
right.
On the one hand is the organization has 

188
00:10:12,491 --> 00:10:13,324
established a more sensible conditions.
20% of the budget should be spent on 

189
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:18,880
equipment here.
Even European countries,

190
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:19,714
which spends more on soldiers than they 
need still arms meeting this 

191
00:10:22,931 --> 00:10:25,660
requirements on the other hands.
European countries,

192
00:10:25,661 --> 00:10:28,990
I'll still quite disorganized and use 
very different systems,

193
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:33,880
which makes production maintenance and 
deployments more ends more expensive.

194
00:10:33,910 --> 00:10:35,850
Just have a look at what happens with 
tech.

195
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:39,640
The United States primarily uses one 
kind of tank,

196
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:40,563
the Abrams tank,
while the Europeans use it to 19 

197
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:43,774
different models.

198
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,190
Imagine the chaos when he joined 
deployments.

199
00:10:48,191 --> 00:10:49,024
It has to be organized.
They can't even share the same 

200
00:10:50,891 --> 00:10:51,724
replacement equipments and as well the 
same is true for much more than just 

201
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:57,130
tanks.
And so the final question is,

202
00:10:57,131 --> 00:11:00,670
can it may say play a significant role 
in the future?

203
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,470
In our opinion here,
a visual politic,

204
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:04,090
yes,
they absolutely can,

205
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,660
but only after a bit of a perspective 
shift.

206
00:11:07,690 --> 00:11:08,523
We feel that countries can spend money 
better and actually share resources 

207
00:11:11,411 --> 00:11:12,244
rather than just spending more,
even though that might upset some 

208
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:18,580
military contractors.
Well now we'd like to know your opinion.

209
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:20,920
Now,
what should the future of NATO beat?

210
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,580
Do you think that the European countries
that should meet to the U S is demands?

211
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:25,443
Or do you think a NATO,
you should focus less on conventional 

212
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:28,870
warfare?
Or maybe you think,

213
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:30,370
Nita,
you should just dissolve.

214
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:33,070
