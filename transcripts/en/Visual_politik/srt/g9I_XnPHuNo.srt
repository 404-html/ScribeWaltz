1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:00,893
Here's a question for you.
How much does the U s actually pay for 

2
00:00:02,761 --> 00:00:06,780
its army and all the military operations
that they carry out day after day,

3
00:00:06,781 --> 00:00:07,200
all over the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,033
wow.

5
00:00:12,820 --> 00:00:14,410
Well,
that's precisely what we're going to try

6
00:00:14,411 --> 00:00:15,244
and answer in this video.
But there's no debate when it comes to 

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:18,190
one thing.
And that's the,

8
00:00:18,191 --> 00:00:20,500
they're military industry is one of the 
most opaque,

9
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:21,383
most influential hands,
most powerful industries in the United 

10
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:24,400
States.

11
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:25,233
It's,

12
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,493
well that's true for the United States 
as it is for pretty much anywhere else 

13
00:00:29,771 --> 00:00:30,604
in the world too.
So I'm starting the question that I 

14
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:35,050
posed to just a moment ago.
It means no more or no less than opening

15
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:37,690
a debate with a rather large 
implications for,

16
00:00:37,691 --> 00:00:38,980
in this case,
the bill.

17
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:41,560
And it could be hundreds of billions of 
dollars.

18
00:00:41,561 --> 00:00:42,910
So having given that wanting,
uh,

19
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,210
let's see what is happening within the 
corridors of both the,

20
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:47,163
again and the Capitol talking about the 
u s army is going to involve exorbitant 

21
00:00:59,001 --> 00:01:02,840
figures as well as a huge amount of 
bureaucracy and political machinery.

22
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,703
So big amps,
so opaque is this institution that we 

23
00:01:05,811 --> 00:01:08,160
can practically talk about.
A parallel governor.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:10,410
Yes.

25
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:11,243
In 2015 a report and made by the 
Pentagon itself stated that they had to 

26
00:01:14,221 --> 00:01:15,054
pay tens of billions or pizza,
tens of billions of dollars every year 

27
00:01:18,811 --> 00:01:22,650
for extra costs caused by bad management
practices in the army.

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:26,950
Best Practices such as paying private 
contractors,

29
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:29,840
more money than would be expected in a 
competitive market.

30
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,590
We're going to be in peril because we're
spending dollars like it doesn't matter.

31
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:34,573
Robert L stine managing director 
chartwell capital management and former 

32
00:01:38,001 --> 00:01:41,510
chairman of the defense business board,
and do you know think that it's only the

33
00:01:41,511 --> 00:01:44,200
big military industrial companies,
those who produce fighters,

34
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,810
missiles,
and other military equipment?

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:46,970
Not at all.
In fact,

36
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:47,863
a good part of all of those billions 
that have operated each year come from 

37
00:01:50,541 --> 00:01:52,640
activities such as accounting,
logistics,

38
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:54,310
or human resources.
You heard that,

39
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:55,303
right?

40
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,543
In fact,
the bureaucracy of the US armed forces 

41
00:01:59,171 --> 00:02:00,130
this super big,
that's it.

42
00:02:00,131 --> 00:02:03,100
Employees,
no less than a million people.

43
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,770
Take a look at this graphic from the 
Washington Post.

44
00:02:09,070 --> 00:02:10,480
As you can see,
the u s army,

45
00:02:10,481 --> 00:02:11,314
it has almost as many people in its 
officer's doing administrative 

46
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:17,530
activities as it does people who are 
preparing for war or performing national

47
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:19,240
security tasks.
I had all of this,

48
00:02:19,241 --> 00:02:21,430
of course,
it comes with an enormous costs.

49
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,870
Almost a quarter of the military budget 
is invested in these types of tasks,

50
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,010
tasks,
that's all,

51
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,930
well,
let's say importance,

52
00:02:28,931 --> 00:02:30,760
but I really,
a quarter of the money,

53
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,060
if you consider it another way,
all of this bureaucracy alone by itself,

54
00:02:39,061 --> 00:02:42,120
counselors,
the third largest military budget in the

55
00:02:42,121 --> 00:02:42,954
world,
which actually wouldn't be too far 

56
00:02:43,801 --> 00:02:46,770
behind the second biggest military 
budget and that sort of China,

57
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,000
and that's not all according to a study 
by the Department of Defense itself,

58
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:55,770
published in October,
2017 approximately one out of every five

59
00:02:55,771 --> 00:02:56,604
installations that the again has do 
nothing being synthy sit idle and they 

60
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,850
could be closed with no military 
consequences whatsoever.

61
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:07,480
And this would save millions of dollars 
per year per each one.

62
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,363
But this is something that isn't really 
quite supported by the politicians in 

63
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,394
Washington.
Everything that has to do with the 

64
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:20,870
Pentagon and the US Defense Department 
involves talking about some gigantic,

65
00:03:20,871 --> 00:03:24,170
hyper bureaucratic and very,
very expensive structures.

66
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,063
Well,
as we're going to see later in this 

67
00:03:26,121 --> 00:03:26,954
video,
all of this waste is very important in 

68
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:31,190
the political debate,
but for now,

69
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,053
let's see how much money these military 
adventures really costs the United 

70
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,313
States.

71
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,353
Okay,

72
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,170
cost of war.

73
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:46,860
Does he know?

74
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:47,913
Just say says military adventures aren't
randy that strange if we count the Cold 

75
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,723
War,
the United States has been at war since 

76
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:54,340
1941

77
00:03:58,700 --> 00:03:59,170
homicide.

78
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:02,040
It's,
we all know it since the end of 2001 the

79
00:04:02,041 --> 00:04:05,680
u s military has been involved in active
combat every year.

80
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:08,320
Syria operations in the Indian Ocean,
Africa,

81
00:04:08,321 --> 00:04:09,154
Yemen,
and Eastern Europe and above all Iraq 

82
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:14,290
and Afghanistan.
It doesn't look like it's ending anytime

83
00:04:14,291 --> 00:04:15,124
soon.
So now with all of this going on all 

84
00:04:16,571 --> 00:04:17,404
around the world,
can you imagine how much this stuff 

85
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,570
costs?
Well,

86
00:04:19,571 --> 00:04:20,404
pay attention here because the numbers 
are probably more scandalous than you 

87
00:04:22,361 --> 00:04:23,194
think.

88
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:27,270
Cool.
Before we get into these numbers,

89
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:28,104
let's mention a quick side note here.
One thing is the annual defense budgets 

90
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:33,330
and another thing is the operating 
budgets.

91
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,300
This means that when we hear about how 
much the US spends on its army,

92
00:04:36,301 --> 00:04:38,940
the cost of wars and military operations
themselves,

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,760
arms usually taken into account all the 
factors there.

94
00:04:41,761 --> 00:04:42,594
Since 2001 US taxpayers have spent just 
in those military adventures and loan a 

95
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:51,510
whopping one point $7 trillion,
one point $7 trillion by the way,

96
00:04:51,511 --> 00:04:52,344
is more than Canada's GDP and almost as 
much as Italy's put it another way in 

97
00:04:55,021 --> 00:04:59,580
today's dollars that is more than twice 
what the Vietnam War costs or five times

98
00:04:59,581 --> 00:05:04,581
that of the cost of the Korean War 
bought DB Capitol Hill.

99
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,490
Because if you think this is a high 
figure,

100
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,340
well wait just a minute because we 
aren't done yet.

101
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:15,620
Cool

102
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:17,860
of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars for 
example,

103
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:18,723
isn't over,
and I'm not referring only to the 

104
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,154
military expenditures that or has,
but also to the costs that have already 

105
00:05:24,191 --> 00:05:25,024
occurred,
which the federal governments will have 

106
00:05:26,441 --> 00:05:27,550
to pay for in the future.

107
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:30,970
Of course costs

108
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:31,853
such as long term medical care for ex 
combatants due to injuries produced in 

109
00:05:34,301 --> 00:05:35,134
combat expenses for veterans,
and of course the cost of the debts 

110
00:05:37,691 --> 00:05:41,740
incurred to finance the war in total 
estimate states that these p was alone.

111
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,603
Again,
it ends up costing between four and $6 

112
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:46,263
trillion.
That is just a vast amount of money to 

113
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:48,364
get some idea of the real costs here.
This is the equivalent to all of the 

114
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:51,124
military expenditure for all European 
NATO countries for the next 15 to 23 

115
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,530
years.
All of these military adventures,

116
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,560
they are a total financial,
yeah,

117
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:00,623
mess.

118
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,513
Well,
we think that countries should take a 

119
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:06,700
look at these bills and be more prudent 
in the future.

120
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:12,140
For example,
when one visits to the United States,

121
00:06:12,141 --> 00:06:15,110
something that draws the attention is 
the poor state of its infrastructure,

122
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,250
its roads,
its metro,

123
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,510
its railroads,
et cetera.

124
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,373
In fact,
infrastructure in the u s has the guns 

125
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:20,383
to be a serious problem.
We spend trillions and trillions of 

126
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,710
dollars outside of our nation,
but we can't build a road,

127
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,090
a highway,
a tunnel,

128
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:32,890
a bridge in our own nation and we watch 
everything falling into district.

129
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:35,380
Yeah.
Well

130
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:38,860
with what the Iraq and Afghanistan wars 
of costs,

131
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,950
the United States could have the best 
infrastructure in the world.

132
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:43,143
Wow.

133
00:06:44,850 --> 00:06:47,190
Pasta 30 years.
The American hat,

134
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:48,263
13 walls spanning 14 point $2 trillion.
What if the spread of proud of them 

135
00:06:53,451 --> 00:06:54,284
money on building up the infrastructure?
What if the money spin on the Middle 

136
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,650
East,
middle west of the United States,

137
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,190
developing the industry there,
that could be changed a lot.

138
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:10,200
So it's not peep the other countries 
stew jobs from your guys.

139
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:13,770
It is your strategy.
So far I think things are quite clear.

140
00:07:13,830 --> 00:07:14,663
We have now seen how much Washington is 
military adventures around the world if 

141
00:07:17,101 --> 00:07:18,660
cost the American people.
No,

142
00:07:18,661 --> 00:07:19,494
I think it's going to be interesting to 
see how much the federal government 

143
00:07:21,181 --> 00:07:23,640
really spends every year on the fence.
Hands.

144
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:25,830
I'm going to say that if you haven't 
been surprised so far,

145
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:27,710
you probably are about to be

146
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:31,393
done.

147
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:36,680
Scott.
We dominate the sea.

148
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:39,770
We dominate the land and space

149
00:07:46,010 --> 00:07:47,420
crew,
military expenditure.

150
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,303
Sure.

151
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,880
More or less than the US defense budget 
is by far the largest in the wells.

152
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,773
Consider 2017 as an example.
In this year of $560 billion were spent 

153
00:07:58,771 --> 00:07:59,604
on the fence,
and of course we also have to add that 

154
00:08:00,991 --> 00:08:01,824
$60 billion for operating expenses.
This is approximately three times the 

155
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:06,504
military expenditure of China,
or nine times the military expenditure 

156
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,440
of Russia.
However,

157
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:11,880
these amounts don't,
dude,

158
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,150
all of the expenses that the military 
well generates for the u s government.

159
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,013
Consider for example,
the cost of medical treatment for those 

160
00:08:17,461 --> 00:08:20,340
wounded in combat or the costs of 
veteran expenses.

161
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,233
Have a quick look at this

162
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,093
scruff.

163
00:08:25,490 --> 00:08:26,390
Yes.
As you can see,

164
00:08:26,391 --> 00:08:27,224
if we take all of these expenses into 
account that the armed forces expenses 

165
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:33,920
rise above $900 billion par.
Yeah,

166
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:34,813
that's nearly a trillion dollars and we 
still need to consider it national 

167
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:41,450
security expenses like financing 
intelligence agencies such as the CIA,

168
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:47,660
but even if we only take the department 
of Defense and nuclear weapons budgets,

169
00:08:47,661 --> 00:08:48,494
which is $620 billion,
we can see how the military efforts in 

170
00:08:52,011 --> 00:08:55,070
GDP terms is one of the largest in the 
world.

171
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:01,950
However you want to look at those 
numbers.

172
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:02,813
They are exorbitant,
but before we finish answering today's 

173
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,990
question,
let's just wait for a moment because the

174
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,824
u s military dominance is somewhat less 
impressive when we consider the 

175
00:09:10,651 --> 00:09:15,651
following factors.
First price difference.

176
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:21,740
That is you comms by the same things 
with $1 in the u s as you can with $1 in

177
00:09:21,741 --> 00:09:23,240
China.
If we correct this,

178
00:09:23,241 --> 00:09:26,540
we would see that the u s military 
expenditure would be equal to the sum of

179
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:30,860
China and Russia's military expenditure.
It's still an enormous amounts,

180
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:35,861
but it's not as impressive.
Pins and this is really important,

181
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:42,240
we have to consider how things have 
changed in recent.

182
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,074
Yes,
allow me to explain her in constant 

183
00:09:44,521 --> 00:09:46,380
dollars.
That is adjusting for inflation.

184
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,273
Real defense expenditures have actually 
fallen since 2010 by 25% this is 

185
00:09:51,451 --> 00:09:54,780
unquestionably the largest reduction in 
decades and in a way,

186
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,643
this is what is great.
You're worrying many analysts and 

187
00:09:57,391 --> 00:10:00,180
politicians in Washington,
especially the Republican Party,

188
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:02,800
I understand we're in an election year.
I understand all that,

189
00:10:02,801 --> 00:10:07,801
but how in the world do you refuse to 
take up legislation that is only purpose

190
00:10:08,231 --> 00:10:11,620
is to defend this nation,
which is under a shop.

191
00:10:11,650 --> 00:10:16,270
We rely on these young men and women.
We rely on them to defend the nation and

192
00:10:16,271 --> 00:10:20,280
now we won't even act to train,
equip,

193
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,910
pay,
and care for them.

194
00:10:22,250 --> 00:10:23,083
Could it be that despite all the money 
for the U S is spending today on 

195
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:27,560
defense,
it's still isn't enough?

196
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:28,760
Well,
let's consider it.

197
00:10:29,050 --> 00:10:29,883
Yes.

198
00:10:33,900 --> 00:10:34,800
Waning power

199
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,150
since

200
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,410
fall of the Soviet Union.
Yeah,

201
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,680
yeah,
yeah,

202
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:44,460
Yup.
That all of you.

203
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,433
Yeah.
You said

204
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,913
z consequent Dan's of the Cold War.
It could be expected that the size of 

205
00:10:49,391 --> 00:10:52,840
the United States armed forces has 
decreased substantially.

206
00:10:52,870 --> 00:10:55,720
We're talking about fewer submarines,
fewer aircraft carriers,

207
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,430
fewer bombers,
fewer soldiers,

208
00:10:57,431 --> 00:10:58,690
et Cetera,
et cetera.

209
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,933
How has the new equipment has arrived 
such as the aft 22 wraps or the b two 

210
00:11:04,031 --> 00:11:04,864
bomber,
the f 35 a new class of aircraft 

211
00:11:06,461 --> 00:11:07,780
carriers,
new cruisers,

212
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:10,370
and among other things,
high precision drones and miss

213
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:19,500
what all of this technological 
innovation has had two consequences.

214
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,440
On the one hand it has increased the u s
military capabilities,

215
00:11:22,470 --> 00:11:23,303
but on the other hand it has altered 
equipments and operational costs and of 

216
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:30,390
course as we've seen,
the budget has been decreasing in recent

217
00:11:30,390 --> 00:11:31,223
years.
Years of underfunding have given us a 

218
00:11:32,791 --> 00:11:37,170
weakened force that despite the hard 
work of our brave troops is ill equipped

219
00:11:37,171 --> 00:11:39,390
to handle the missions.
We keep throwing at it.

220
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:40,343
Edwin j fullmer,
founder and president of the Heritage 

221
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,160
Foundation do you to all of this,
the Republican Party,

222
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:46,023
and also it must be said,
a large part of the Democratic Party 

223
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:50,190
seem to have something quite clear in 
their minds.

224
00:11:50,280 --> 00:11:52,950
The military budget must be increased.

225
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,253
Currently

226
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:59,310
the smallest army since 1940

227
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:04,530
our navy is at its smallest size.
Since 1917 I would send weapons.

228
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:05,453
You were crane.
The first thing we need to do to make 

229
00:12:07,721 --> 00:12:09,670
America stronger as a strength of our 
military

230
00:12:11,670 --> 00:12:14,940
as candidates for the presidency and 
famous Arizona Senator John Mccain,

231
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:15,803
who incidentally is the chairman of the 
Armed Services Committee of the 

232
00:12:17,731 --> 00:12:19,170
sentence,
is one of the politicians.

233
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,004
He was most committed to this issue and 
has proposed raising the military 

234
00:12:22,351 --> 00:12:23,184
budgets to $800 billion.
They say that the current scas military 

235
00:12:26,161 --> 00:12:27,090
budget,
for example,

236
00:12:27,091 --> 00:12:29,940
of course the accidents that the u s 
navy has had in the Pacific,

237
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:34,850
US Navy relieves admiral in charge of 
seventh fleet in wake of deadly disaster

238
00:12:34,851 --> 00:12:35,684
at see,
this is as well as causing new and 

239
00:12:37,111 --> 00:12:40,860
emerging threats such as that if North 
Korea or an increasingly strong China,

240
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,290
and as you can imagine,
dealing with these increasing threats is

241
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,190
not going to be

242
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:45,093
she

243
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:48,870
doing and modernizing the nuclear 
arsenal that is,

244
00:12:48,871 --> 00:12:50,630
and nuclear weapons bombers,
missiles,

245
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,464
and submarines is trump promised,
implies an investment in the next 30 

246
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:56,810
years of more than one point $2 
trillion.

247
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,820
However,
if you spend more than anyone else,

248
00:12:58,821 --> 00:12:59,810
much more,
in fact,

249
00:12:59,811 --> 00:13:02,930
and you all still note Belita,
shouldn't you perhaps be rethinking your

250
00:13:02,931 --> 00:13:03,764
strategy should in the u s perhaps 
modifying his role in some way so it's 

251
00:13:06,291 --> 00:13:09,290
not as involved in so many conflicts 
around the world.

252
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:11,940
And further there's the question of 
whether military expenditure,

253
00:13:11,941 --> 00:13:12,774
it really helps national security or 
does it really just help the arms 

254
00:13:15,081 --> 00:13:15,914
industry.
And it's important to note here that 

255
00:13:17,061 --> 00:13:17,894
that arms industry does generously 
finance lobbyists and political 

256
00:13:20,781 --> 00:13:21,980
campaigns.
Well,

257
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:22,893
if he's hanging out the questions and 
the answers that pretty much are your 

258
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,120
penance,
but now it's your turn.

259
00:13:26,121 --> 00:13:29,090
Do you think that the u s should 
increase its military budgets?

260
00:13:29,091 --> 00:13:29,841
Well,
leave y'all on.

261
00:13:29,841 --> 00:13:30,674
Sit in the comment section below as well

Friends at the reconsider media

podcasts,
they provided the vocals in this episode

267

that were not mine.
And as always,

268

thank you for,

269
00:13:48,450 --> 00:13:49,283
we currently have the smallest army 
since our navies are the smallest size 

270
00:13:55,351 --> 00:13:59,100
since 1917 I would send weapons.
You were crane.

271
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,203
The first thing we need to do to make 
America stronger as the strength of our 

272
00:14:02,971 --> 00:14:03,804
military.
