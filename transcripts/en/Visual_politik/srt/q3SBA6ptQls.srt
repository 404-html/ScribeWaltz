1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
It's the second most populated country 
on earth.

2
00:00:04,570 --> 00:00:05,650
Seventh biggest economy.

3
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:06,783
Yeah.

4
00:00:07,690 --> 00:00:12,690
One of the 10 biggest military budgets 
in the world and is a nuclear power.

5
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:20,600
India is a stranger in political terms.
If I were to ask you,

6
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:22,790
who's the prime minister of India,
could you tell me?

7
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:26,903
No.
I am aware that many of you will 

8
00:00:27,961 --> 00:00:30,780
actually know this,
especially if you're watching this video

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:31,614
from India,
but if you don't know who the prime 

10
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:35,250
minister of India is,
don't worry because.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,600
Well,
that happens a lot

12
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,600
on the 26th of May,
2014 after an absolute majority,

13
00:00:48,601 --> 00:00:49,434
which had not been seen in 30 years.
Narendra Modi became the prime minister 

14
00:00:52,681 --> 00:00:54,120
of India.
Moody's mission,

15
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,000
whether it was clear boost growth 
investments,

16
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,970
and to create millions of jobs in 
conclusion,

17
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:04,350
turn India into a superpower capable of 
competing with China on an economic,

18
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,270
political,
and military level.

19
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:07,310
Gene Kim,
how todd?

20
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,700
You know India because you're a politic 
view is,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,553
is something all on eternal promise.
It's always that country that seems to 

22
00:01:17,671 --> 00:01:19,740
be the next one that's going to take 
off,

23
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:20,663
but it never really does.
Where you can see that this is 

24
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:23,304
definitely the case.
If we take a look at India's GDP and 

25
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:27,000
compare it to that of China,

26
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:36,780
they seem quite different economic 
development in the last few decades,

27
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:39,090
so with Moody's victory expectations 
all,

28
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:40,080
once again,
high end,

29
00:01:40,081 --> 00:01:42,450
India has again become the talk of the 
town.

30
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:43,313
Moody is repeating over and over again.
The 21st century is going to be India's 

31
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,770
century.
Well,

32
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:51,630
before we get into all of that,
let's take a look at boody himself.

33
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,020
Oh,
he's Narendra Modi,

34
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:57,370
vegetarian,
single ends,

35
00:01:57,371 --> 00:01:58,204
a yoga enthusiast,
Modi escapes the traditional politician 

36
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
profile.
He comes from a family of limited means 

37
00:02:03,601 --> 00:02:04,434
and when he was a child,
used to help his father sell tea in a 

38
00:02:06,301 --> 00:02:07,134
train station.
This has helped him and the sympathy of 

39
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,714
many poor people in the country.
They see him as an example of a rags to 

40
00:02:13,201 --> 00:02:17,490
riches story and shows that rags to 
riches in India can sometimes work.

41
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:21,723
His political ideology has always been 
very attached to Hinduism and he is not 

42
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:27,910
always taken a moderate approach.
In fact,

43
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,100
before getting involved with the BJP 
party,

44
00:02:30,101 --> 00:02:30,934
he was involved with the rfs as potty.
The RSS Party isn't extreme rights 

45
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:35,284
policy that had Mahatma Gandhi's 
assassin as one of its members for 13 

46
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,750
years,
between 2011 and 2014.

47
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,470
Moody was the regional Prime Minister in
the state of good Gerard Gerard.

48
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:51,970
It's 65 million inhabitants has become 
numb to Moody's leadership,

49
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,270
India's greatest economic driver with an
annual growth rate of 10 percent.

50
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:01,853
It's like these impressive figures.
Social Welfare has also greatly 

51
00:03:04,261 --> 00:03:05,094
improved.
Almost every home has access to the 

52
00:03:06,331 --> 00:03:07,530
plumbing,
electricity,

53
00:03:07,531 --> 00:03:08,364
and preschool education.
While the general election in India was 

54
00:03:10,681 --> 00:03:11,514
taking place,
moody promised to replicate what he'd 

55
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:15,720
done in his state in the rest of India.
Furthermore,

56
00:03:15,721 --> 00:03:20,610
he promised to do this in just 10 years,
which is only two political terms,

57
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:25,120
Lauren Nigga,
we did look by his dish arms,

58
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:26,083
arms,
shit,

59
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:28,943
abuse,
because I've magical Niggas don't 

60
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:30,790
niggas.

61
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:32,860
This is because for Moody,
the Year Twenty,

62
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:34,930
22 is a landmark.
Yeah.

63
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,440
It's the 75th anniversary of India's 
independence.

64
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:39,333
The country will also support us,
China as the world's most populous 

65
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,304
country.
Reaching a population of one point 6 

66
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,810
billion people,
Moody says that by the year 20,

67
00:03:46,811 --> 00:03:47,644
22,
it's going to be clear that the 21st 

68
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:51,130
century is India

69
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,083
century.

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,113
This is certainly not going to be easy,
especially in a country where the 

71
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:08,740
population is growing by 28 people every
minute.

72
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:13,090
Yes,
measure problem.

73
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,940
Now India has many problems,
but three,

74
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:19,700
do you stand out as particularly 
important?

75
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,240
The first is that India is a 
bureaucrat's paradise.

76
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,103
In fact,
if bureaucracy was the key to 

77
00:04:25,401 --> 00:04:26,234
prosperity,
India would probably be the most 

78
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:32,000
prosperous country in the world.
Unfortunately though bureaucracy instead

79
00:04:32,001 --> 00:04:34,820
of encouraging business actually 
prevents it.

80
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:35,773
John Cody has blamed the Indian 
bureaucracy for putting roadblocks in 

81
00:04:39,231 --> 00:04:40,064
the group of Indian economy.
According to the doing business report 

82
00:04:42,861 --> 00:04:43,694
from the wells bank,
which estimates how easy it is to do 

83
00:04:45,711 --> 00:04:46,544
business in India occupies the 130th 
position each step of the way to 

84
00:04:51,141 --> 00:04:51,974
establishing a business in India takes a
ton of documents and then the taxes are 

85
00:04:56,051 --> 00:04:58,790
not only high.
Not that anyone really pays them,

86
00:04:58,791 --> 00:05:01,130
but they are also a nightmare to sort 
out,

87
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:01,993
for example,
on not only different taxes in each 

88
00:05:03,951 --> 00:05:04,784
individual state,
but there are sometimes different taxes 

89
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:10,460
for each individual product or different
models of the same product.

90
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:11,353
This is something that commonly happens 
with vehicles and it is a real nice 

91
00:05:14,511 --> 00:05:15,920
math.
Anyone to work out

92
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:23,610
Katina with the hand or they buddy nick 
lingered further.

93
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,233
DSM among public workers has reached 
such a critical state that some 

94
00:05:29,241 --> 00:05:30,074
hospitals have been forced to closed 
temporarily because of the lack of 

95
00:05:32,571 --> 00:05:33,404
staff.
The second big problem is that 

96
00:05:34,611 --> 00:05:39,380
regulations in the marketplace make it 
so complicated that the market is barely

97
00:05:39,381 --> 00:05:42,230
able to function on the borders between 
different states.

98
00:05:42,231 --> 00:05:45,020
You'll find trucks that are just cuing 
to cross the border.

99
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:45,913
Not a few people say that it's actually 
easier to import something from abroad 

100
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,750
than it is to get something from another
state.

101
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,703
Further,
there is the terrible state of the 

102
00:05:52,581 --> 00:05:53,414
country's infrastructure as well.
Estimated that half of the country's 

103
00:06:01,361 --> 00:06:05,260
harvest goes to waste every year because
of these delays.

104
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:06,183
And the third big problem is that 
corruption is a big issue in Indian 

105
00:06:09,191 --> 00:06:11,020
society.
As a quick example of this,

106
00:06:11,021 --> 00:06:11,854
it is estimated that 50 percent of all 
money that the government gives for 

107
00:06:14,561 --> 00:06:18,250
welfare either ends up in the hands of 
corrupt politicians or middlemen.

108
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:22,240
And so this is the country for Moody,
is having to deal with

109
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,930
government policies.

110
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:30,880
Some have suggested it has not yet taken
place.

111
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:31,743
However,
the truth is is that the government has 

112
00:06:33,011 --> 00:06:35,470
achieved some notable advances.
For example,

113
00:06:35,471 --> 00:06:38,590
we could highlight the following in 
order to reduce bureaucracy.

114
00:06:38,650 --> 00:06:39,483
The government has created a committee 
with the purpose of determining which 

115
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:45,160
rules and regulations are obsolete and 
should be eliminated.

116
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:48,640
So far they've done away with more than 
1700 of these rules.

117
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:52,950
Moody has eliminated many restrictions 
on foreign investments is past the first

118
00:06:52,990 --> 00:06:53,823
bankruptcy law.
And to set up a powerful planet to make 

119
00:06:56,110 --> 00:06:57,850
India a destination for business

120
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,920
is also set forth an ambitious plan for 
better financial inclusion.

121
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:07,110
This plan has a pretty unpronounceable 
name,

122
00:07:07,111 --> 00:07:09,180
so I'm just going to show it on the 
screen now.

123
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:10,163
And this plan has basically allowed for 
people to have a bank account for the 

124
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:13,584
first time,
the number of people who've taken this 

125
00:07:14,761 --> 00:07:16,410
up,
it's about $200 million.

126
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:17,244
And this basically means that that 
welfare money that is coming from the 

127
00:07:19,201 --> 00:07:20,034
government,
it doesn't have to go through any 

128
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,640
middlemen further.
The government has also put forth a plan

129
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:25,860
to simplify a very complicated tax 
system.

130
00:07:25,861 --> 00:07:28,380
Having a flat sales tax at the national 
level.

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:32,700
There's also

132
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:33,533
announced that they're going to be 
spending a lot of money on 

133
00:07:34,651 --> 00:07:35,484
infrastructure with a hundred and 
$30,000,000,000 being spent on rail by 

134
00:07:39,151 --> 00:07:40,820
2020.
So again this year,

135
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:44,550
our plan is to really connect a lot of 
these small towns and cities to the main

136
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,384
national highway and,
and the target or the government is to 

137
00:07:46,951 --> 00:07:49,800
construct 10,000 kilometers of road 
every year.

138
00:07:49,890 --> 00:07:50,723
But these aside,
Moody's most risky moves so far happens 

139
00:07:53,641 --> 00:07:58,641
in November of 2016 mbs cash crisis.
In order to fight corruption,

140
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:08,340
India suddenly made the countries 
501,000 rupee notes illegal.

141
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,480
These represented 85 percent of all of 
our cash in India.

142
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:15,120
A country that is really a cash based 
economy,

143
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:16,013
the goal was to find dirty money and 
punish it when the owners came into the 

144
00:08:18,961 --> 00:08:19,794
bank to switch out that 500 and the 
phenols and notes for ones in the new 

145
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:23,640
design.
However,

146
00:08:23,641 --> 00:08:26,580
the plan was an utter disaster.

147
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:27,503
The government didn't have enough cash 
to replace the money that people wanted 

148
00:08:29,881 --> 00:08:31,080
to exchange.
Further,

149
00:08:31,081 --> 00:08:31,914
the country's atfs weren't working 
properly because the new currency was a 

150
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:37,890
different shape to the old currency and 
the ATM is hadn't been adjusted.

151
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,233
I don't know what to do.
People here have no money to buy my 

152
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:43,770
products so I can't buy stock from the 
market either.

153
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:44,783
It's the end of my business.
This was a botched operation that left 

154
00:08:47,041 --> 00:08:50,520
the country moneyless and caused 
significant damage to the economy.

155
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:53,250
Sales fell in November.
By more than 30 percent.

156
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,800
Many businesses simply weren't able to 
pay workers,

157
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,140
and many business transactions have to 
be canceled.

158
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,860
Some studies estimate that the total 
damage was two points of India's GDP.

159
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:04,620
This would mean for the bank note switch
cost India.

160
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,530
$50,000,000,000 ends.
Unfortunately,

161
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,630
the poorest in the country were the 
hardest hit.

162
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:10,583
Then the government tried to save,
but it was all part of some big plans 

163
00:09:12,921 --> 00:09:15,540
who encourage people to use more 
electronic money,

164
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:16,473
a politician foreign policy agenda.
Now this is the field where the prime 

165
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:26,490
minister has really excelled.
In his first year alone,

166
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,980
he visited my new team members

167
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:41,550
that he's only been in power for a short
amount of time,

168
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:43,820
that he has a treatment,
some notable advances.

169
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,290
The Pakistan treaty has improved India,
Pakistan,

170
00:09:46,291 --> 00:09:48,410
one relationship.
It's a relationship with China,

171
00:09:48,411 --> 00:09:51,350
has started dealing with some economic 
and commercial issues.

172
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,393
At a joint press conference,
President Xi Jinping announced 20 

173
00:09:55,520 --> 00:10:00,080
billion US dollars worth of investment 
in India's infrastructure in five years.

174
00:10:00,170 --> 00:10:01,460
However,
without any doubt,

175
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,323
the greatest strength of Moody's 
political agenda has been his approach 

176
00:10:05,391 --> 00:10:06,224
to the United States.
The chemistry between Obama and Moody 

177
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,374
has been quite significant and their 
encounters have been frequent and 

178
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,920
friendly.
They have both even published an article

179
00:10:13,921 --> 00:10:15,000
altogether in the Washington.

180
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:21,880
What we really need to ask now is we'll 
moody achieve his goals.

181
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:22,743
That I'll certainly a great deal of 
challenges that he is going to have to 

182
00:10:25,181 --> 00:10:26,500
overcome.
For example,

183
00:10:26,501 --> 00:10:29,430
it's been made clear to the prime 
minister just how tricky it is,

184
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:33,790
but the limits on bureaucracy further 
moody has avoided many essential reforms

185
00:10:33,791 --> 00:10:34,624
such as ending India's labor regulation,
which has mentioned that four out of 

186
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:40,750
every five jobs in the country are on 
the gray market.

187
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:43,600
Moody claims to be an admirer of Lee 
Kuan Yew.

188
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,513
Singapore's ex prime minister Modi 
doesn't seem to have the same drive or 

189
00:10:47,621 --> 00:10:49,990
determination to transform India's 
model.

190
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,780
So this is just our opinion here,
revisional politic,

191
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,480
and we would love to know what you 
think.

192
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:58,660
Do you think that the 21st century is 
going to be India Century?

193
00:10:58,690 --> 00:10:59,523
Do you think that Modi is going to 
achieve all that he has set out to 

194
00:11:02,201 --> 00:11:04,690
achieve?
Do let us know in the comments below?

195
00:11:04,691 --> 00:11:05,890
We'd love to hear from you.
