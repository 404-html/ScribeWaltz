1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,293
Today we're going to talk about South 
Korea or as Kim Jong UN would call the 

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,583
Bad Korea.
You've probably heard of this country 

3
00:00:13,701 --> 00:00:15,350
because it's probably the way your 
mobile phone,

4
00:00:15,351 --> 00:00:16,184
your TV screen or possibly even your car
with manufacturers or perhaps because 

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:23,970
it's the place where the most watched 
youtube video of all time came from lone

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:29,460
star.
Yes,

7
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:32,303
South Korea is a big power,
not only at the cultural level but also 

8
00:00:35,101 --> 00:00:35,934
at an economic one.
I'm sure every one of you watching this 

9
00:00:37,681 --> 00:00:38,514
video haven't least one product from 
Samsung or lg arounds you South Korean 

10
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:46,830
companies on absolutely on fire,
and this is a surprise given that in the

11
00:00:46,831 --> 00:00:47,664
19 sixties,
South Korea was an extremely poor 

12
00:00:50,191 --> 00:00:53,170
country and no,
we're not talking about relative poverty

13
00:00:53,171 --> 00:00:54,004
here.
Other countries like Zimbabwe where 

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,030
actually more developed with this,

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,113
right?

16
00:01:01,240 --> 00:01:02,073
The West in just one generation,
South Koreans went from starvation to 

17
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:06,464
one of the most prosperous societies in 
the world and so now comes the big 

18
00:01:10,191 --> 00:01:11,024
question.
What exactly did South Korea do to 

19
00:01:12,831 --> 00:01:13,664
become quite so rich and hold on a 
second because if you're a regular 

20
00:01:16,251 --> 00:01:18,080
viewer,
I probably know what you're thinking.

21
00:01:18,081 --> 00:01:18,950
You're thinking,
oh,

22
00:01:18,951 --> 00:01:19,784
it's another video where visual politic 
tell me how marvelously wealthier 

23
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:24,800
country became because of free market 
capitalism,

24
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:26,290
right?
Rice,

25
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:28,300
while I'm sorry to disappoint you,
more,

26
00:01:28,310 --> 00:01:31,010
not as much of the story of South Korea 
is a bit different.

27
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:31,903
Fritz

28
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:37,470
compared with their neighbors to the 
north.

29
00:01:37,471 --> 00:01:38,304
South Korea is a free paradise,
but their economic model has one 

30
00:01:41,131 --> 00:01:44,730
peculiarity that sets it apart from the 
rest of the world.

31
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:45,803
So then the question is what are the 
reasons that explained this incredible 

32
00:01:48,661 --> 00:01:51,480
progress in South Korea,
and more importantly,

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,230
why was Gangnam style so controversial 
in South Korea?

34
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:56,303
Both of these questions,
I promise they are actually related and 

35
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,083
these are the questions that we're going
to answer in today's video to the 

36
00:02:06,591 --> 00:02:08,150
bottom.
As you probably know,

37
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:08,984
in 1953,
the Korean peninsula was split into two 

38
00:02:11,301 --> 00:02:14,660
halves after a war,
which killed over 2 million people.

39
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,553
At that moment,
we could actually say that South Korea 

40
00:02:17,571 --> 00:02:20,270
is the country that was actually in more
trouble economically,

41
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,120
the normal pads,
all of the industries and companies,

42
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:25,760
while the south was agricultural and 
under develop,

43
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,193
had no desks and most of the children,
golden majority of their nutrition from 

44
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,470
powdered milk that was given by theu ,
s and Europe.

45
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:40,520
This is why in 1960,
after many protests General Park Chung,

46
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:43,070
he organized a coup d'etat and took 
power.

47
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:45,800
This is how the first South Korean 
dictatorship started.

48
00:02:45,890 --> 00:02:46,723
During the following 27 years,
the country had three different 

49
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:51,560
dictators.
All of them came into power in a violent

50
00:02:51,561 --> 00:02:54,290
way by overthrowing the previous one.
Nevertheless,

51
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,290
despite the political instability in 
those times,

52
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,153
the South Korean

53
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:03,083
a minute,
because this economy is not as free as 

54
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,160
you might.
In fact,

55
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,980
a free market is organized in a bottom 
up fashion.

56
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:12,730
The private businesses decide how,
when and what they want to sell.

57
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,713
Then the state comes in and regulates 
all of that activity through various 

58
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:17,590
laws.
Well,

59
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:20,350
puncturing east system was quite the 
opposite.

60
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,210
This was a top down system is policy was
to meet with the most important families

61
00:03:25,211 --> 00:03:28,510
in the country who controlled most of 
South Korea's industries.

62
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,210
This group included the founders of 
Samsung and lg

63
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,113
Jean,

64
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:36,290
so essentially he put them in a room and
said,

65
00:03:36,380 --> 00:03:38,960
look,
from now on I will give you whatever you

66
00:03:38,961 --> 00:03:39,794
need to grow.
If one year you kind of weigh your 

67
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:42,290
taxes,
it's okay,

68
00:03:42,291 --> 00:03:44,430
I'll forgive you.
Do you need some ground swell?

69
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:45,650
But here you go.
You can have it.

70
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:47,480
You need to borrow some money from 
abroad.

71
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,373
Well,
the government is going to back your 

72
00:03:50,031 --> 00:03:52,130
loan.
Even if you can't pay your debts,

73
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:57,160
the state is going to help you.
Our country will be in jeopardy in order

74
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:02,200
for a country not to fall.
It must cultivate its own strength.

75
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:04,730
Nonetheless.
Unlike other countries like France,

76
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:08,120
South Korea didn't put up any barriers 
to international trade.

77
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:09,163
Actually since that very first moments 
and the government's guaranteed rule of 

78
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:16,310
law and low taxes for all businesses 
regardless of where they came from.

79
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,383
That's not only that's Pacchiu.
He gave all kinds of tax incentives for 

80
00:04:20,691 --> 00:04:23,900
companies and individuals to invest and 
save money.

81
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,613
In other words,
the big conglomerates like xy or Latte 

82
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,483
gods to compete in an open markets with 
other corporate juggernauts from Japan 

83
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:38,550
or the United States,
but at the same time they also help from

84
00:04:38,551 --> 00:04:41,670
the government in South Korea has no 
natural resources,

85
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:42,504
but a big population.
Those companies put a focus on 

86
00:04:44,431 --> 00:04:49,431
industries that required a large 
workforce that's manufacturing and this.

87
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:51,230
This was the beginning of

88
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:55,513
all nation.
Imagine the life of one of the hundred 

89
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,320
thousand workers employed by Samsung in 
South Korea.

90
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,950
He gets up in the morning in a house 
built by Cyt,

91
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,560
the construction company run by the 
Samsung Group wanting his breakfast.

92
00:05:06,561 --> 00:05:07,394
He watches the latest visual politic 
video groups that we'd like to think on 

93
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:13,610
his Samsung Galaxy phone.
Then he takes his Renno Samson car.

94
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,503
Yep.
You read that right?

95
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,630
Rented cars are manufactured by Samsung 
in South Korea.

96
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,090
And guess where as this car insurance?
Yep.

97
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,240
The all guessing.
The friends here.

98
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:22,120
He gets it from

99
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:22,953
Samsung

100
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:27,360
after a hard day working at.
Yeah.

101
00:05:27,361 --> 00:05:28,560
Okay.
You're getting the picture now.

102
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:29,690
Now South Korea,
man,

103
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:31,860
he wants to go get some beers with his 
colleagues,

104
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:34,650
so he goes to the Cantina.
It's again,

105
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:35,543
you're getting the picture.
We can come and our friend wants to 

106
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:39,540
spend some quality time with his wife 
and children,

107
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:42,870
so we decided to take them to a park.
So do you think you'd go?

108
00:05:43,290 --> 00:05:44,123
Yep.
He goes to some things very own Disney 

109
00:05:45,721 --> 00:05:47,820
style theme park.
In other words,

110
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:50,830
if you work for Samsung,
the company is everything.

111
00:05:50,831 --> 00:05:51,664
Okay.

112
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:54,540
We're

113
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:55,373
talking about the biggest cable and all 
of South Korea and now you might be 

114
00:05:58,941 --> 00:05:59,774
wondering what exactly is the Chi ball 
tribals are big conglomerates supported 

115
00:06:03,591 --> 00:06:06,200
by the state?
Some of them like to already defunct.

116
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,630
Diu were started by the administration 
itself.

117
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,210
Others were born in the 1945.

118
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:14,963
Most of them started being family owned,
but as they grew they became public 

119
00:06:18,031 --> 00:06:18,864
companies and all of them have a number 
of different business lines and 

120
00:06:21,451 --> 00:06:22,710
products.
For example,

121
00:06:22,711 --> 00:06:25,290
LG is famous for that.
Tvs and then mobile phones,

122
00:06:25,291 --> 00:06:26,124
but in South Korea they will all say the
distributors of Coca Cola in total 

123
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,980
around 100 cables.
Ams,

124
00:06:31,981 --> 00:06:35,160
they own the biggest asset in the South 
Korean economy.

125
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,060
Now,
as I said before,

126
00:06:36,061 --> 00:06:38,610
the government does place in red carpet 
tons of their feet,

127
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,250
but this doesn't mean they have a blank 
check.

128
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:43,170
This is why I went to Cabo as big as 
day.

129
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:48,171
We went bankrupt.
No one came to bail is a clear incentive

130
00:06:51,311 --> 00:06:53,650
for these companies to be on the edge of
innovation.

131
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,640
For instance,
in 2008 Suny,

132
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:58,340
the Japanese wanted to create the first,
Oh,

133
00:06:58,350 --> 00:06:59,183
led tvs,
but this technology there wasn't 

134
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,430
advanced enough and the screens were 
pretty expensive,

135
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:06,190
even priced too high for most of the 
luxury markets.

136
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,083
So the Sony guys,
but the project on hold and they never 

137
00:07:09,671 --> 00:07:10,504
really got back almost.
Whereas South Korea and lg at the same 

138
00:07:13,001 --> 00:07:14,590
technology now they have the same

139
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:15,713
problem

140
00:07:17,770 --> 00:07:19,210
so well.
What did they do?

141
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,133
Well,
they launched mobile phones with a much 

142
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,740
smaller display.
This way.

143
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:24,603
They took advantage of their assets and 
what is more important is they learned 

144
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:28,953
how to work with this new technology.
This is why in a very short amount of 

145
00:07:31,781 --> 00:07:32,614
time,
they found ways to produce affordable 

146
00:07:34,510 --> 00:07:35,343
own led TV screens.
Spell hold on for just a minute because 

147
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:41,630
there's another more important parts 
which helps explain this very innovative

148
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:42,493
culture.

149
00:07:44,650 --> 00:07:45,483
South Korean education.
We'll know it's South Korean children 

150
00:07:47,961 --> 00:07:48,794
that have always had one of the best 
marks in the international piece of 

151
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:52,263
test.
The whole country stops during 

152
00:07:53,151 --> 00:07:56,090
university entrance exams in South 
Korean school suspends it,

153
00:07:56,150 --> 00:08:00,440
whatever they need to guarantee the best
education for their boys and girls.

154
00:08:00,470 --> 00:08:02,300
Now,
the flip side of this coin is that those

155
00:08:02,301 --> 00:08:05,150
kids have the biggest suicide rate in 
the world.

156
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,133
In fact,
all of South Korea has a problem with 

157
00:08:07,581 --> 00:08:08,414
suicide.
The country having these second highest 

158
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,190
suicide rate per capita in the world 
since the beginning.

159
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
The government is understood.
The cables would need high skilled 

160
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,020
workers.

161
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:21,250
Yes.
Are they

162
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,083
designed an educational system that 
works in line with the nation's 

163
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:25,384
companies?
This explains why South Korean children 

164
00:08:27,311 --> 00:08:30,040
are incredibly good at math center of 
excellence,

165
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:31,390
memorization,
abilities.

166
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:33,970
Further their respect for authority and 
hierarchy.

167
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,380
It's always religious and this is why 
none of them want to start a company.

168
00:08:38,530 --> 00:08:42,340
The dream of every South Korean is the 
winds up working in one of these cables.

169
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:43,293
If they work hard,
they might even become a manager and to 

170
00:08:45,311 --> 00:08:46,144
get a house in paradise on earth.
That is a famous district of Seoul with 

171
00:08:49,871 --> 00:08:52,000
a name that's going to sound pretty 
familiar to you.

172
00:08:52,210 --> 00:08:54,670
Yup.
I'm talking about the Gangnam district.

173
00:08:55,370 --> 00:08:59,390
Oh God.

174
00:09:02,170 --> 00:09:07,170
The meaning of Gangnam style called 
human warm Gal during the day,

175
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:09,123
a glossy one,
someone who knows how to enjoy the 

176
00:09:10,511 --> 00:09:13,270
freedom of a cup of coffee,
but when the night comes down,

177
00:09:13,271 --> 00:09:16,510
her heart gets warmer because she has a 
goal with two faces.

178
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,980
Hey,
sexy lady,

179
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:20,230
your big brother,
Gangnam style.

180
00:09:20,510 --> 00:09:25,160
This is an extract from that famous song
that became so popular back in 2012,

181
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:26,053
even led to the main thing aside,
getting into some trouble with the 

182
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:32,420
authorities and due to the lyrics,
having inappropriate content for society

183
00:09:32,421 --> 00:09:34,280
that's obsessed with respect for 
authority.

184
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,173
Something's aesthetics or something as 
radical as the hipaa movements from 

185
00:09:38,031 --> 00:09:38,864
Elvis back in the 19 fifties,
but the truth is that a hierarchical 

186
00:09:41,271 --> 00:09:42,104
economy,
one which relies on a few big 

187
00:09:43,341 --> 00:09:44,174
corporations,
is not a good recipe for a state of the 

188
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,510
economy.
In fact,

189
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:50,420
South Korea big as it is in the 
manufacturing industry,

190
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:53,210
lags behind in other fields such as 
services or.

191
00:09:53,510 --> 00:09:54,343
Yeah,

192
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:05,600
economy depends so much on governmental 
and Kabul decisions.

193
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:08,230
There is almost no space for 
entrepreneurs.

194
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,163
Think about it.
I mean even if you wanted to start a 

195
00:10:10,461 --> 00:10:11,294
company,
it's pretty hard to compete with your 

196
00:10:12,411 --> 00:10:14,590
competitors are supported by the 
government,

197
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,290
but not only that,
these hierarchical structures are not as

198
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:20,150
efficient as you might think.
In fact,

199
00:10:20,151 --> 00:10:20,984
most of the Chi balls have become 
bureaucratic bmo that require lots and 

200
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,394
lots of money to work.
This phone leads the sales of mobile 

201
00:10:28,161 --> 00:10:30,320
phones in the entire world.
However,

202
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,310
they make almost no profits and that was
it

203
00:10:33,570 --> 00:10:34,403
probably

204
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:40,130
right.
Things are starting to change.

205
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:41,053
A lot of self driven.
Youngsters have been educated in Europe 

206
00:10:42,831 --> 00:10:43,664
or America and now they are coming back 
to their country of origin with a new 

207
00:10:46,881 --> 00:10:48,410
ends,
more critical mindset,

208
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:49,853
more entrepreneurial spirits.
This generation is creating the rates 

209
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,623
for a startup ecosystem,
but that is still a lot of work to be 

210
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,700
anyway,
whether you like as an ot,

211
00:11:02,701 --> 00:11:07,290
we must admit that this top down model 
has been successful in South Korea lines

212
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:10,530
of all of this.
There are still some questions that must

213
00:11:10,531 --> 00:11:11,364
be onset.
What would happened if a country like 

214
00:11:12,481 --> 00:11:13,314
Samsung collapsed?
What would happen to the country as a 

215
00:11:14,761 --> 00:11:15,594
whole and not only that,
but this marriage between politics and 

216
00:11:18,061 --> 00:11:22,620
business has created lots of incentives 
for corruption on a massive scale,

217
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,900
but that's something we're going to 
cover in a future video.

218
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,673
You should absolutely check out this 
other video we made about the rising 

219
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:36,200
Asian middle class and also do not 
forget to check out.

220
00:11:36,201 --> 00:11:38,600
We'll reconsider media podcast where you
can hear the voice.

221
00:11:38,601 --> 00:11:39,970
That isn't my voice on this

222
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:43,400
videos.
I was.

223
00:11:43,430 --> 00:11:44,390
No,
but the question is,

224
00:11:44,391 --> 00:11:48,440
do you think that this crossover between
hierarchy and the free market could ever

225
00:11:48,441 --> 00:11:49,274
work in other countries,
and what's your opinion about the South 

226
00:11:51,740 --> 00:11:52,573
Korean system?
Please do leave your opinion in the 

227
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,050

We'd love to hear from you.

228
00:11:56,230 --> 00:11:57,063
