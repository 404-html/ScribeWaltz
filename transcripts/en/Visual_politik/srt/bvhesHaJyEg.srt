1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:08,443
we told you in a previous video how 
Saudi Arabia wants to leave behind once 

3
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:15,470
and for all it's addiction to oil and 
it's become a nation similar to Dubai or

4
00:00:15,471 --> 00:00:16,304
Abu Dhabi.
In this video we are going to look at 

5
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:18,644
the country in more depth in order to 
get an idea of just how this mission to 

6
00:00:22,101 --> 00:00:23,870
get free from oil is going

7
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:28,550
[inaudible].

8
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,853
The thing is there is a specific name,
a leader behind this ambitious plan and 

9
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,040
my question to you is,
do you know who this person is?

10
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,120
Well,
for those of you don't,

11
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:38,954
the person who is turning everything 
upside down in Saudi Arabia is Mohammed 

12
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:44,173
bin Salman.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,370
Awesome.

14
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:48,140
My name alone,
it doesn't explain much.

15
00:00:48,141 --> 00:00:48,974
So now you might be wondering who is 
this man really awesome his intentions 

16
00:00:52,671 --> 00:00:56,240
and what exactly is he trying to do?
While these are the questions that we're

17
00:00:56,241 --> 00:00:59,390
going to be answering in today's visual 
politic video,

18
00:00:59,420 --> 00:01:01,280
so let's get started.
Shall We?

19
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:04,913
The Prince of change.
He might only be a list of more than 30 

20
00:01:08,671 --> 00:01:09,504
years olds,
but Mohammed bin Salman is already one 

21
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:16,020
of the most powerful people in the wells
and he controls more money than we could

22
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,770
ever possibly count formerly while he is
the minister of Defense,

23
00:01:19,771 --> 00:01:22,230
deputy crown prince,
second deputy prime minister,

24
00:01:22,231 --> 00:01:26,820
chief of the royal quarter and chair of 
the Council for Economic and Development

25
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:29,040
Affairs.
So what does all of this mean?

26
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:31,170
Well,
Mitt kinds of things that the hammer has

27
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,710
been sell mom is in control of well 
everything.

28
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,100
He's got complete control over the 
country's oil,

29
00:01:38,101 --> 00:01:38,934
over the massive financial reserves that
had been accumulated over the years and 

30
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:44,910
also over Saudi Arabia's massive defense
budgets.

31
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:48,960
So today the power of the prince is 
practically total.

32
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,183
Hey,
well this isn't something normally that 

33
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,860
never has such a young man had so much 
power before.

34
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:56,723
I've until now,
the norm was for the country to be 

35
00:01:57,781 --> 00:02:00,450
controlled by seniors have 80 or more 
years.

36
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:03,660
We were very reluctant to go for any 
kind of change,

37
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,213
but all of a sudden changes in the foot 
because what Mohammed bin Salman is 

38
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:12,540
trying to do with Saudi Arabia is turn 
it into a new United Arab Emirates,

39
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:16,950
a country which the prince has an 
enormous amount of admiration for later.

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,660
We're going to see just how he is doing 
this,

41
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,270
but for now you need to bear something 
in mind.

42
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:26,130
The youth of the country chair been 
Salmaan as the savior of the kingdom and

43
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:30,330
this is a country where half of its 
population is less than 25 years olds.

44
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:33,840
And so in a country like that,
it's pretty important.

45
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:36,780
But so now you might be wondering,
why does this man come from?

46
00:02:36,781 --> 00:02:39,480
How can such a young man who have so 
much power?

47
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:41,990
Well,
he's the son of the current king.

48
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:49,040
Wait just a second before you explained.
Well of course he is because you need to

49
00:02:49,041 --> 00:02:49,874
know that being the son of the king in 
the Saudi Arabia wasn't always such an 

50
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:54,800
important thing.
In fact,

51
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:59,820
Banal Been Somal is not even the ad to 
the Saudi throne battle over the throne.

52
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,400
It's all one bin.
Abdulaziz is the king of Saudi Arabia.

53
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:09,640
He is the son of the man who was 
considered the founder of the country.

54
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:10,533
Abdulaziz been sold since cell died in 
1953 the kingdom has been inherited by 

55
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,240
brother,
BAFTA,

56
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:18,730
brother Doula.
Z's been sowed,

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,940
had 17 known wives and it is calculated 
that he also had around 32 sons,

58
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:26,230
so there were quite a few potential 
heirs.

59
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,300
The thing is that when the current is 
king,

60
00:03:28,301 --> 00:03:29,134
he was believed to be the 25th son 
reached power a few years ago in 2015 

61
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,513
the first thing he did was change the 
laws of succession even though some of 

62
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:37,384
his brothers are still alive,
he has decided to put to the new 

63
00:03:39,041 --> 00:03:41,710
generations in charge of this process to
do this.

64
00:03:41,710 --> 00:03:44,440
He has decided to appoint his nephew,
Muhammad bin Nayef,

65
00:03:44,441 --> 00:03:45,274
who is closer to Washington than others 
and he has been in charge of security 

66
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:48,783
for the last few years as well as the 
secret services and the fight against 

67
00:03:51,911 --> 00:03:54,880
fundamentalism.
However,

68
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,714
it seems like young,
the Hamad bin Selma on the main 

69
00:03:57,101 --> 00:03:57,934
character in this video it seems he's 
not very happy about that and it seems 

70
00:04:00,820 --> 00:04:01,653
that he is taking aim at the throne.
He wants to be the future king of Saudi 

71
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:07,300
Arabia,
so here's eagerness for reforms could be

72
00:04:07,301 --> 00:04:09,700
explained as an attempt to to gain 
popularity.

73
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,090
In fact that is what most analysts 
currently think that as well.

74
00:04:13,091 --> 00:04:13,924
It does make sense.
The fall of the price of oil has given 

75
00:04:16,841 --> 00:04:19,480
Mohammed bin Selma and the opportunity 
to aim for the throne,

76
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:22,150
which is something his father obviously 
supports.

77
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:24,910
If Saudi vision 2030 starts showing good
result in,

78
00:04:24,911 --> 00:04:25,744
someone will be in a better position to 
ask for a reward and it's become 

79
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,880
potentially the new add to the throne.
However,

80
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:31,743
there are a few problems on the road 
ahead both for been some on as well as 

81
00:04:35,051 --> 00:04:36,290
the country.
On the one hand,

82
00:04:36,350 --> 00:04:38,410
there are problems inside the royal 
family.

83
00:04:38,480 --> 00:04:42,220
Then someone has made a lot of enemies 
who accused him of being power hungry.

84
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,440
On the other hand,
his father,

85
00:04:43,460 --> 00:04:45,700
the currents king is quite old,
81 years.

86
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:47,380
He seems to have some memory issues.

87
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,430
So this means that there are two 
possible scenarios ahead.

88
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,350
If the current's king,
there was so many more years,

89
00:04:54,351 --> 00:04:57,200
the Prince bin on,
we'll be able to consolidate his power.

90
00:04:57,230 --> 00:04:58,850
However,
if the king doesn't live so long,

91
00:04:58,851 --> 00:04:59,684
the current had been some Alan's cousin 
could become the new king and wish 

92
00:05:02,750 --> 00:05:03,583
goodbye.
Both do the prints and his Saudi vision 

93
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:05,920
2030

94
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:06,753
it

95
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,713
Mars.
The reality is is that this is how 

96
00:05:10,861 --> 00:05:11,694
Monica is work,
but I'm pretty sure that some of you by 

97
00:05:13,351 --> 00:05:16,410
now you're probably thinking,
well this is all fascinating Simon,

98
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:18,990
but why should I care what happens into 
Saudi Arabia?

99
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,860
Well,
you should.

100
00:05:19,861 --> 00:05:21,960
Katherine's probably more than you 
think.

101
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:22,823
Saudi Arabia is still the biggest oil 
producer now and it is also the most 

102
00:05:26,581 --> 00:05:29,030
important and influential country in the
Arab.

103
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,073
Well,

104
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,960
evolution towards openness for this 
country.

105
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,900
It could be something very positive for 
the world's cans for now,

106
00:05:39,901 --> 00:05:40,734
the plan,
Saudi vision 2030 it seems to be the 

107
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,170
only opportunity for the country to 
progress and evolve.

108
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:47,063
But now that we've said that,
what exactly is the plan for this 

109
00:05:49,081 --> 00:05:49,500
coming?

110
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:54,500
Sure.
Incorrigibles

111
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:58,183
so far in today's story,
we've seen a handsome prince and the 

112
00:06:00,071 --> 00:06:04,040
battle over the throne,
but we need a third ingredients for this

113
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:07,640
Saudi soap opera,
and that's luxury hands money.

114
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,530
Well,
of all the royal families in the world,

115
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:10,364
the Saudis,
the royal household of Saudi Arabia 

116
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:15,650
mights be the most addicted to money and
luxury as well.

117
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,590
Now you're going to see why,
as we have mentioned in several videos,

118
00:06:18,591 --> 00:06:19,424
the fall of oil prices is jeopardized,
many countries and among them is Saudi 

119
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,650
Arabia only in 2016 and even though many
adjustments were made,

120
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,513
the country had a deficit of more than 
$80 billion and is now the question 

121
00:06:33,351 --> 00:06:37,160
becomes what can they do in order to fix
such a hole in their budget?

122
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,053
Well,
in 2016 the Saudi government announced 

123
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:41,930
that the country was going to go on a 
diet.

124
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:45,890
For the first time in decades,
austerity reached Saudi Arabia.

125
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:50,570
The government have been Salmaan started
with reductions in public wages,

126
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:53,630
cancelled many projects,
whose profitability was uncertain,

127
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,240
reduce subsidies and gasoline,
water,

128
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,133
electricity.

129
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,693
This,

130
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,613
it was a pretty huge shock for one of 
the most subsidized economies in the 

131
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:11,161
wells.
I mean,

132
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:12,220
up until now,
do you have,

133
00:07:12,221 --> 00:07:13,054
you will oil.
It helps pay for everything in Saudi 

134
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:15,900
Arabia.
However,

135
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,580
hold on for just a moment because,
well,

136
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,700
that's not the whole story.
Under Solomon's rule,

137
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,520
prince is still enjoy many material 
privileges.

138
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,090
The subsidization system hasn't changed 
for the royal household.

139
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,703
Take a look at this.
The King of Saudi Arabia has ultra 

140
00:07:30,991 --> 00:07:35,250
luxurious palaces all over the world 
that are available to him in Marbella in

141
00:07:35,251 --> 00:07:36,084
Spain.
He has l Roseo a palace inspired by no 

142
00:07:38,251 --> 00:07:39,360
less than the White House.

143
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,500
But I mean,
it's gotta be pretty boring,

144
00:07:45,501 --> 00:07:46,334
right?
I have to go to the same palace all the 

145
00:07:47,331 --> 00:07:48,051
time.
I mean,

146
00:07:48,051 --> 00:07:48,884
how tiresome so lost some of the king 
built a new and gigantic palace in 

147
00:07:52,491 --> 00:07:53,870
Tangier.
In Morocco.

148
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,180
The palace has its very own hospital in 
here.

149
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,570
The king gets French seafood delivered 
direct from France.

150
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,261
But I mean,
Hey,

151
00:08:00,261 --> 00:08:01,094
what's the problem with chartering a few
airplanes so the king can eat some nice 

152
00:08:03,681 --> 00:08:05,120
and lobsters?
Right?

153
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,021
Oh.
And by the way,

154
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:06,854
when the king of Saudi Arabia travels,
he travels and big and his last tour 

155
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:16,571
around Asia in 2016 the king traveled 
with 1500 people and he took with him to

156
00:08:17,091 --> 00:08:17,924
Mercedes Benz s 600 limousines.
In order to carry it all 27 planes had 

157
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:23,830
to be used.
Yes.

158
00:08:23,831 --> 00:08:26,170
So it seems that this is what the royal 
family,

159
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:29,420
you can sit as austerity and the print 
is our main character.

160
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,313
He's no different either.
During holidays in France and at the 

161
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:35,840
same time,
oil prices were falling.

162
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:36,703
Print.
Salmaan saw the yacht of the Russian 

163
00:08:37,941 --> 00:08:39,410
magnate,
Uri Sheffler.

164
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,530
It was love at first sight.
He sent an assistant right away in order

165
00:08:42,531 --> 00:08:43,364
to close the deal.
Solman bought it for 550 million US 

166
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,430
dollars.
Sorry.

167
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,910
Now you know how the family likes to 
live animals?

168
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:53,240
Well,
they are quite a big family.

169
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,103
It's all estimations indicate that the 
Saudi royal family has around 15,000 

170
00:08:57,601 --> 00:08:58,434
members.
The government has evaded the question 

171
00:08:59,581 --> 00:09:02,250
of membership numbers,
but even low and estimates,

172
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,084
but it did about 5,000 people.
As we're talking about people who live 

173
00:09:05,851 --> 00:09:09,390
thanks to the public budget and to have 
all kinds of privileges.

174
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,253
They are paid impressive salaries.
They have access to hospitals which are 

175
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,584
essentially five star palaces ans they 
do profitable business with the 

176
00:09:16,621 --> 00:09:19,950
government.
They have incredibly luxurious spends,

177
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:24,780
honestly rather incredible lifestyles,
and the reality is that that is very,

178
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:27,990
very expensive according to estimations 
from the u s government.

179
00:09:27,991 --> 00:09:30,690
Since transparency is not a tradition in
the royal family of,

180
00:09:30,691 --> 00:09:31,524
they spend about $2 billion every year 
in order to keep up their sumptuous 

181
00:09:35,521 --> 00:09:36,354
lifestyle.
Other estimates indicate the royal 

182
00:09:40,401 --> 00:09:43,430
family takes over a million barrels of 
oil a day,

183
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,440
which is 10% of the national production

184
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,820
progress of Saudi vision 2030

185
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:53,553
this wanting to all of this,
the transition of Saudi Arabia plans in 

186
00:09:55,691 --> 00:09:56,524
vision 2030 keeps moving forward.
Saudi Arabia designs a city of 

187
00:10:01,031 --> 00:10:04,170
entertainment almost as big as Las Vegas
bosses.

188
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:08,560
The truth is that it is moving slowly.
Adams for the time being Saudi Arabia is

189
00:10:08,561 --> 00:10:11,230
regaining better relations with the 
United States.

190
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,093
In fact,
that Donald Trump's first international 

191
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:15,370
visitors,
the u s presidents was to react.

192
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,263
But yes,
in order to achieve that to the Saudis 

193
00:10:17,861 --> 00:10:22,861
had to sign some pretty big checks.
Trump signs the single largest arms deal

194
00:10:23,381 --> 00:10:24,214
in US history with Saudi Arabia.
We're $350 billion and this has to be 

195
00:10:28,901 --> 00:10:29,734
added to the billion dollar contracts 
they already have with some of the 

196
00:10:32,021 --> 00:10:36,490
largest companies in the United States 
and it all has a target in mind.

197
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,353
Saudi Arabia wants to reinforce the 
protection it has from the u s to 

198
00:10:40,391 --> 00:10:42,790
defendant for impossible enemies such as
Iran.

199
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,683
We're actually going to be discussing 
this special relationship in a future 

200
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:47,960
video,
so please do not forget to subscribe,

201
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:50,620
but leaving the u s aside in the last 
few months,

202
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:55,150
Saudi Arabia has set the world's largest
funder for technological investments.

203
00:10:55,210 --> 00:10:59,060
They have $100 billion available to 
invest further more.

204
00:10:59,090 --> 00:10:59,923
The country's eliminating many 
restrictions on foreign investments and 

205
00:11:02,141 --> 00:11:04,330
some projects are being already 
discussed.

206
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,210
Some of these have already been put into
motion such as theme parks,

207
00:11:07,211 --> 00:11:09,970
huge hotel resorts,
and even nuclear power plant

208
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,050
bus plus.

209
00:11:13,050 --> 00:11:13,883
As we have been telling you,
transforming this country won't be easy 

210
00:11:16,891 --> 00:11:19,860
at all.
And this is just the start of their very

211
00:11:19,861 --> 00:11:20,694
own soap opera.
This is the huge money wastage of the 

212
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:24,240
royal family,
which means they have to deal with a lot

213
00:11:24,241 --> 00:11:25,074
of criticism from the country's powerful
religious leaders who by the way have a 

214
00:11:27,721 --> 00:11:29,580
terrible lack of respect for civil 
rights.

215
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:30,473
Then there is the war in Yemen and the 
uncertainty of the air to the Saudi 

216
00:11:33,181 --> 00:11:34,014
throne.
So now what do you think about the 

217
00:11:35,281 --> 00:11:37,710
luxurious lifestyle of the Saudi royal 
family?

218
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:41,250
Do you think [inaudible] will ever 
become some sort of Dubai?

219
00:11:41,310 --> 00:11:42,143
