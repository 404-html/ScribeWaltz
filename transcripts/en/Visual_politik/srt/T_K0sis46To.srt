1
00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:05,850
How do you measure a country's power?
By power,

2
00:00:06,591 --> 00:00:10,520
I mean it's ability to impose its will 
over other countries.

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:14,060
We could measure their GDP,
their economic growth,

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:17,810
or perhaps even the size of the army,
but I've got another idea.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:20,763
The best way of showing your power is 
forcing other countries as large as 

6
00:00:24,491 --> 00:00:25,324
yours to make a big sacrifice.
The sacrifice might be something that 

7
00:00:29,081 --> 00:00:29,914
goes against their will,
that they will do it because you want 

8
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:36,700
them to,
well,

9
00:00:36,701 --> 00:00:37,534
this is what trump is trying to do to 
the European Union and what is the big 

10
00:00:42,011 --> 00:00:44,920
sacrifice that he wants the Europeans to
make it as easy.

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,600
He wants them to cut their ties with the
Islamic Republic of Iran.

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,360
The question is,
is it really that big of a sacrifice and

13
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,160
most importantly,
Kenny,

14
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:03,600
when this bat,
well,

15
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:07,350
these are the very questions we're going
to answer in this video.

16
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:16,613
Iran is that country.
We've all these independent movies that 

17
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:19,410
yes,
say you're like,

18
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:21,930
but you've never,
never watched.

19
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:22,823
Now there is something even more 
important to Iran's economy and that's 

20
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:26,220
automobiles.

21
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:32,060
Yes,
Divya is,

22
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,953
Iran is actually one of the biggest con 
manufacturers in all of the Middle East 

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:38,750
and I know we have probably thinking 
right now,

24
00:01:38,751 --> 00:01:41,990
you're probably thinking you're on ready
Simon Development,

25
00:01:41,991 --> 00:01:45,500
gumtree,
virtually isolated making cars,

26
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,980
but as surprised as you might be,
they even have their own brands.

27
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:49,873
For example,
the beautiful vehicle that you see here 

28
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:52,694
is the Qataris a mind.
It's a sedan that sells in Iran as a 

29
00:01:55,471 --> 00:01:57,140
genre in Russia.
In Venezuela.

30
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:57,741
Okay,
okay.

31
00:01:57,741 --> 00:01:59,330
You shouldn't have really expected 
anything.

32
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:01,640
Amazing.
The engines are old and the manufacturer

33
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,740
does have a lot to improve,
but I mean,

34
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:04,783
look,
what can you expect for $700 and 

35
00:02:11,221 --> 00:02:12,054
seriously,
we actually think that if you took this 

36
00:02:13,111 --> 00:02:13,944
car,
you improve it with a bit of modern 

37
00:02:14,851 --> 00:02:17,220
technology would actually be quite a 
good deal.

38
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,173
You see,
we actually think that if you took this 

39
00:02:19,051 --> 00:02:21,000
car,
improved it with some modern technology,

40
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:25,050
it would still be cheap and it would 
probably be like not a terrible vehicle.

41
00:02:25,051 --> 00:02:27,450
It would probably do really well in 
developing markets.

42
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,790
And actually this is why since 2015 when
most of neurons,

43
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,350
all sanctions were lifted,
many European companies actually started

44
00:02:34,351 --> 00:02:35,640
investing in the country.

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:39,200
Great

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,050
to enter new joint venture,

47
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:45,450
right?
Sit

48
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:49,780
back on the road and your end with deal 
to build cars,

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,620
but there is a way,
way more than cost.

50
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:53,773
You see,
the Iranian stock market has a market 

51
00:02:55,241 --> 00:02:59,920
capitalization three times bigger than 
the Egyptian one and they have all kinds

52
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:00,754
of companies.
Unlike other oil rich countries in the 

53
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,080
region who runs economy is surprisingly 
diversified.

54
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,093
Banks,
mining companies and even telecoms all 

55
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:11,140
exist and this what is attracted other 
European companies.

56
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:19,190
Mark's entry into Aren with high web 
partnership.

57
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,250
If this wasn't enough,
Iran has a well educated population.

58
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:25,280
The literacy rate is way higher than 
that of Syria,

59
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,950
Iraq and many of the neighboring 
countries,

60
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:28,873
well then 4 million citizens study or 
have studied at university and this 

61
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:36,470
means a well trained workforce that can 
work for really quite low wages.

62
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,363
Add to this,
the fact that the country has over 80 

63
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,613
million people and some of them,
you've actually got a really good place 

64
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:42,770
for investment.
Nonetheless,

65
00:03:42,771 --> 00:03:47,360
this wave of European money has all of a
sudden just stopped.

66
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,500
Yeah,

67
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,080
well,
absolutely sanctioned European companies

68
00:03:56,081 --> 00:03:58,120
that do business with Iran.
But hold on a minute.

69
00:03:58,121 --> 00:03:59,110
I mean,
Donald Trump,

70
00:03:59,111 --> 00:04:02,500
he's the American president.
He can make rules for American.

71
00:04:02,501 --> 00:04:04,720
How many he's all he wants,
but European countries,

72
00:04:04,721 --> 00:04:06,580
I mean,
he's not the president of the world.

73
00:04:06,581 --> 00:04:09,640
How can you impose rules over countries 
that he doesn't govern?

74
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,713
Well,
that is another question we're going to 

75
00:04:11,771 --> 00:04:13,480
answer today,
but before we do,

76
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:16,410
as always,
let's take a look back at the history.

77
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:21,893
Beagle dual in March,
2018 zed te or Chinese phone 

78
00:04:25,331 --> 00:04:26,164
manufacturer,
I had to pay a $1 billion fines of the 

79
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,334
united.
Yeah.

80
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,801
Why?
Well,

81
00:04:35,801 --> 00:04:39,430
they imported microchips from America 
and sold them to Iran.

82
00:04:39,490 --> 00:04:41,800
The White House basically saw this and 
said,

83
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,900
ah,
you're doing business with the bad guys.

84
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:48,070
Now you gotta pay this crazy ass fine or
I'm not going to let you sell your stuff

85
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,100
in my country.
This is a pretty big deal because if you

86
00:04:51,101 --> 00:04:51,934
don't selling in America,
you're not selling in the world's 

87
00:04:53,411 --> 00:04:55,660
richest country ever.
It's really not an option.

88
00:04:55,780 --> 00:05:00,310
So he was willing to pay pretty much 
anything in order to stay in the market.

89
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,473
And well,
this same thing is happening with many 

90
00:05:03,821 --> 00:05:04,350
other company.

91
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:05,183
Nice.

92
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:08,953
But as we said,
European companies started doing 

93
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:15,431
business with Iran in 2015 and we're not
talking about buying oil here,

94
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:20,140
but investments of all kinds.
This is why as soon as trump pasta,

95
00:05:20,150 --> 00:05:21,890
new sanctions,
the EU

96
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:25,620
for oxygen Europe

97
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,453
requests exemptions from trump's Iran 
sanctions for energy aviation and more 

98
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:34,940
basically European leaders wrote a 
letter to the White House asking America

99
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,040
to respect to their economic interests.
As you know,

100
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:39,990
trump isn't a big fan of the European 
Union,

101
00:05:39,991 --> 00:05:44,991
so you can imagine is onset.
This is why in 2018 the European Union,

102
00:05:45,110 --> 00:05:49,770
so big action,
it was time for regulation two two seven

103
00:05:49,771 --> 00:05:50,604
one slash nine six oh wait,
you don't know what regulation two two 

104
00:05:53,731 --> 00:05:55,860
seven one slash nine six is all about,
oh,

105
00:05:55,861 --> 00:05:56,880
don't worry.
No problem.

106
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:02,020
That's why I'm here.
You see regulation d two seven one slash

107
00:06:04,271 --> 00:06:08,200
nine six is something like a legal 
shield against trade wars.

108
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,034
For example,
let's say this Chevrolet discovers that 

109
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:14,650
Aramco has a factory on Iranian soil.
They could take the French company to an

110
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:17,470
American court and to make them pay a 
fine,

111
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:18,603
but at that same moment,
the European Union would impose an 

112
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:21,544
equivalent fine on Chevrolet,
but this is still not the end of the 

113
00:06:25,301 --> 00:06:30,301
story.
Then suppose Renner says,

114
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,553
hm,
well then I'm going to leave Iran 

115
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,950
anyway.
There's too much trouble that,

116
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:35,900
well,
in that case,

117
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:36,733
the European Union could also find the 
company because technically they are 

118
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:41,220
complying with Washington's sanction.
Yeah.

119
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:46,183
Say basically all wraps up.
This basically means that all the 

120
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:52,670
companies doing business with Iran are 
kind of screwed if they stay.

121
00:06:52,671 --> 00:06:53,504
Washington screws them.
If they leave the European Union screws 

122
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:56,963
them.
It's sort of a really big lose lose and 

123
00:06:58,881 --> 00:07:02,540
it's what's known as a political deal.
So the question is now,

124
00:07:02,541 --> 00:07:03,374
who is more powerful?
Who would the European companies prefer 

125
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:07,100
to get screwed by?
Well,

126
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,503
now we're going to see you.

127
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:15,880
Yeah,

128
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,713
the check.
I'm sure all of you have made an 

129
00:07:18,401 --> 00:07:19,234
international transfer at some point.
Let's say you live in Canada and you 

130
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:24,280
need to be paid by an Australian 
company.

131
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:25,143
When you send the invoice,
you don't give you normal bank details 

132
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:29,710
like you'd give to a company in your 
country instead of your gift.

133
00:07:29,711 --> 00:07:32,110
This really long number that also has 
some letters in it.

134
00:07:32,111 --> 00:07:33,460
Look,
something like this.

135
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:42,870
Well,

136
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:45,090
Lee's letters,
all the so called swift.

137
00:07:45,091 --> 00:07:45,924
Yes.

138
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:52,760
Which system is what banks used for 
international money transfers.

139
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,820
It is a network that connects all of the
world's banks.

140
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,480
A number of years around was 
disconnected from the swift network,

141
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:02,900
so this means that even if you wanted to
do business with Iran,

142
00:08:03,190 --> 00:08:04,023
he just couldn't,

143
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:09,830
after all,

144
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:10,853
how can you conduct business with 
somebody you can't even transfer money 

145
00:08:13,561 --> 00:08:14,820
to?
Of course,

146
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:19,410
could send money in a briefcase,
but that's not very convenient.

147
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,860
In 2015 when that nuclear deal was 
signed,

148
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:26,520
Iran returned to the swift system and 
this was the moment.

149
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:27,354
This was the moment when,
and Ron could go back to the 

150
00:08:28,861 --> 00:08:30,960
international business scene.
I know you might be wondering,

151
00:08:30,961 --> 00:08:33,060
well,
who controls the swift system?

152
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:33,961
Well,
yeah,

153
00:08:33,961 --> 00:08:34,890
absolutely.
You guessed it.

154
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:35,933
It's of course a company called swift,
the Society for worldwide into bank 

155
00:08:39,031 --> 00:08:42,720
financial transactions and guests where 
they have the headquarters.

156
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,580
Oh yeah,
it's in Brussels.

157
00:08:44,730 --> 00:08:45,563
So yeah,
I probably know what you're now 

158
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,244
thinking.
You're thinking if all of the 

159
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:50,030
international transactions and managed 
in a euro,

160
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,150
then America doesn't have to do much to 
avoid doing business with Iran,

161
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,320
right?
Well,

162
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,310
no,
not right at all.

163
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:57,150
Very,
very wrong.

164
00:08:57,151 --> 00:09:00,060
You see,
swift is actually a cooperative society.

165
00:09:00,061 --> 00:09:00,894
This means all the important decisions 
made by a board of managers with 25 

166
00:09:04,231 --> 00:09:06,750
representatives from the most important.

167
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:07,693
Thanks

168
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,150
side of this board of managers.
There are two Americans.

169
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,840
One is from Citibank and another is from
jp Morgan Chase.

170
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:25,310
Two representatives will have to pay 
crazy fines if they can't convince their

171
00:09:25,311 --> 00:09:27,800
colleagues to disconnect Iran from the 
swift system.

172
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:28,963
If this happened,
Iran would be isolated from the 

173
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,840
international market.
If you can't make transactions,

174
00:09:32,841 --> 00:09:35,270
you can't do business.
It's really just that simple.

175
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,263
This is such an important matter that 
the European Union is already trying to 

176
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:42,280
come up with an alternative system for 
international transactions.

177
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:44,720
Something like a modern day barter 
system.

178
00:09:44,900 --> 00:09:48,020
They call it spv or special purpose 
vehicle.

179
00:09:48,021 --> 00:09:50,570
The idea is that instead of exchanging 
goods for money,

180
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:53,600
Europe wants to pay with credits for 
other goods.

181
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:54,613
For example,
let's say that Repsol a Spanish company 

182
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:58,490
wants to buy oil from Iran.
Well,

183
00:09:58,700 --> 00:09:59,533
instead of paying with cash,
they could pay with an equivalent some 

184
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:02,923
machinery.

185
00:10:08,620 --> 00:10:09,350
Wow.

186
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,161
So now you might,
you're on you.

187
00:10:10,161 --> 00:10:10,994
Well we got rid of the boss system 
really long time ago cause something 

188
00:10:12,741 --> 00:10:15,020
like this really work today.
Well,

189
00:10:15,021 --> 00:10:17,690
the answer is or any time is going to be
able to tell,

190
00:10:17,691 --> 00:10:18,524
but let's assume that it actually does.
Let's say the companies started using 

191
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:26,090
this spv system to trade with Iran.
So let's get back to our reps.

192
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:29,060
Will example.
This dinosaur juice they just bought has

193
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:30,230
to arrive somehow,
right?

194
00:10:30,350 --> 00:10:31,183
Somehow somebody has to put it on a 
tanker and take it into Barcelona's 

195
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,233
harbor.
Well,

196
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,073
most of the old hangars isn't on the 
planet then managed by a Danish company 

197
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:41,570
called nurse Gif and Denmark.
Well that's in Europe,

198
00:10:41,571 --> 00:10:44,950
but hold on a second.
No harbor is going to accept an oil ship

199
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,813
if it's not insured.
And it turns out most of the insurance 

200
00:10:47,871 --> 00:10:48,704
company is work with oil tankers are 
American or have a lot of interest in 

201
00:10:52,791 --> 00:10:56,270
America,
which explains news like this.

202
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:03,180
Shipping

203
00:11:03,180 --> 00:11:07,440
giant Marishka to abandoned Iran as 
threat of sanctions grows.

204
00:11:07,590 --> 00:11:09,960
Other countries like China,
they already found alternatives.

205
00:11:10,110 --> 00:11:10,943
They have enough at stake,
so you convinced them to do everything 

206
00:11:12,931 --> 00:11:15,360
they can to keep oil suppliers coming in
from Iran.

207
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:16,433
It's their sixth biggest providers.
7% of their dynoed juice comes from 

208
00:11:20,161 --> 00:11:21,850
Tehran,
the Europe.

209
00:11:22,190 --> 00:11:23,910
Europe is a different animal.
In that case,

210
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:26,880
Iran isn't important enough to risk so 
much on this.

211
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,070
In other words,
if you're up wanted to keep buying crude

212
00:11:29,071 --> 00:11:29,904
all from Iran,
they would have to find one new 

213
00:11:31,531 --> 00:11:35,700
transport companies to new insurance 
companies and three,

214
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:37,890
they would have to use bartering.

215
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,163
Yeah,

216
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,470
okay.
I look at anything is really possible,

217
00:11:46,471 --> 00:11:47,304
but so far it does seem that America and
Donald Trump is gonna win this match 

218
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:51,534
against the European Union and all of 
this has got a whole bunch of 

219
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,110
consequences.
In a previous video,

220
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:56,944
we talked about what's happening with 
the international all markets in the 

221
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:01,023
following weeks.
We want to talk about what's going to 

222
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:03,790
happen to the Uranian regime.
Meanwhile,

223
00:12:03,791 --> 00:12:07,840
the big question is can be sanctions and
the Iranian regime.

224
00:12:07,870 --> 00:12:08,703
How much can all prices go up?
You can write me your theories and in 

225
00:12:11,111 --> 00:12:11,944
the following days,
let's have a look and see if they match 

226
00:12:13,491 --> 00:12:14,740
with ours.
In the meantime,

227
00:12:14,741 --> 00:12:15,574
do you visit reconsider media?
That's the podcast that provided the 

228
00:12:17,291 --> 00:12:19,180
vocals in this episode that were not 
mine.

229
