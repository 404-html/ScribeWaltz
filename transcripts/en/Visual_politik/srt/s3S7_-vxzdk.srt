1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
[inaudible].

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:09,640
I think the national media coverage of 
Venezuela increases.

3
00:00:09,730 --> 00:00:10,563
It seems as if they're national media 
coverage of their own country is 

4
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:14,134
actually decreasing.
At the time we were preparing this 

5
00:00:15,731 --> 00:00:18,220
video,
we had a look at the website of Telesur,

6
00:00:18,221 --> 00:00:21,220
one of their largest state owned 
television networks.

7
00:00:21,370 --> 00:00:22,203
On the main page there,
29 headlines and just six of them were 

8
00:00:24,851 --> 00:00:28,180
talking about their own country.
Despite what this looks like on the face

9
00:00:28,181 --> 00:00:29,014
of things though,
this couldn't actually resemble any 

10
00:00:30,701 --> 00:00:33,400
better what is actually happening in 
Venezuela

11
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:35,583
[inaudible]

12
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:38,173
there is no one who denies that the 
South American country is going through 

13
00:00:40,821 --> 00:00:45,320
one of the worst humanitarian crises 
that the entire continent has ever seen.

14
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,530
According to a study run by three 
universities from this country,

15
00:00:48,531 --> 00:00:49,364
the average Venezuelan ways between nine
and 10 kilos less than two years ago 

16
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,893
when the food shortages began.
Now the big question is how much blame 

17
00:00:56,601 --> 00:01:00,020
should be apportioned to the Venezuelan 
President Nicolas Maduro?

18
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,750
This is where people have rather 
difference opinion.

19
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,113
Too many political analysts,
Venezuela is not a democratic nation 

20
00:01:10,941 --> 00:01:11,774
anymore.
Things like the president's attempt to 

21
00:01:12,921 --> 00:01:13,754
dissolve the parliament or jailing 
politicians from the opposition have 

22
00:01:16,581 --> 00:01:21,581
triggered the diplomatic crises at the 
highest level in at Adidas retires their

23
00:01:22,431 --> 00:01:25,280
ambassador in Venezuela with the support
of their parliament.

24
00:01:25,370 --> 00:01:26,203
Nonetheless,
there are others who still play in 

25
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:30,580
Venezuela is a democracy.
They even seen Nicolas Maduro.

26
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,350
The president's is defending himself 
from acute to tar.

27
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,260
So the question is here,
who is right?

28
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,243
Can we say the Venezuela is a 
dictatorship or is there's something of 

29
00:01:40,251 --> 00:01:43,070
an exaggeration they,
we're going to answer this question,

30
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:43,963
but before we do,
let's check out the story of Nicolas 

31
00:01:46,570 --> 00:01:47,630
Maduro.
Bent is government

32
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:52,990
is preparing a coup d'etat according to 
Madurai.

33
00:01:52,991 --> 00:01:57,550
The Venezuelan crisis can be summarized 
as a conspiracy by the United States and

34
00:01:57,551 --> 00:01:58,384
that allies to destroy the Bolivarian 
Revolution and the so called 21st 

35
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:04,880
century socialism,
they elite Imperioli,

36
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:06,743
purest elite despises our people and 
have the goal of destroying our 

37
00:02:10,061 --> 00:02:12,040
lifestyle,
our democracy,

38
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:14,500
our independence,
and our homeland.

39
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:19,450
They have decided to trigger plans to 
destabilize the Venezuelan society.

40
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,340
Oh yeah,
so there's an La,

41
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:21,173
I know you're probably thinking,
but let's just imagine for a quick 

42
00:02:23,470 --> 00:02:26,710
amendment that that theory actually make
some kind of sense.

43
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,050
In this case,
the imperialists delete.

44
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll not only trying to dismantle the 
Venezuelan economy,

45
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:36,520
but also their governments,
and this is what explains Nicolas Maduro

46
00:02:36,521 --> 00:02:37,354
is fear of a coop.
But hold on for just a moment because 

47
00:02:39,371 --> 00:02:40,204
before we continue,
we should explain what acu actually 

48
00:02:42,671 --> 00:02:43,630
means.
Well,

49
00:02:43,631 --> 00:02:44,464
Acute Atar is defined as the taking of 
power in a sudden and violent action 

50
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:51,010
carried out by a powerful group like the
army.

51
00:02:51,070 --> 00:02:52,210
And surprise,
surprise,

52
00:02:52,211 --> 00:02:56,160
the Venezuelan army is absolutely loyal 
to Nicolas Maduro.

53
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,763
Father of the Bolivarian Revolution,
Hugo Chavez used to be a member of the 

54
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:08,260
military.
Unlike other countries like the UK where

55
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:12,070
it is forbidden by law for soldiers to 
run for office in Venezuela,

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,250
there are several ministers that come 
from the armed forces air.

57
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,720
We have left tenants,
Melendez,

58
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:20,270
revise the president's chief of staff or
the General Marco Reavers,

59
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,123
the Minister of foods.
Actually one third of Maduro has 

60
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:25,300
governments comes from the military.

61
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:31,050
This

62
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:34,140
being said,
who could successfully conduct a coup in

63
00:03:34,141 --> 00:03:36,750
Venezuela according to moderate?
Well,

64
00:03:36,751 --> 00:03:40,590
as the amount of gas do you suggest is 
this would be his political opponents.

65
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:44,040
There's only one problem with this 
theory though.

66
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,340
Not one of them has any relationship 
whatsoever with the military.

67
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:49,174
Yeah.
People like on Enrique Katrina's or 

68
00:03:50,401 --> 00:03:51,234
Leopoldo Lopez or any of the other 
opposition leaders are professional 

69
00:03:54,291 --> 00:03:55,124
politicians or former businessmen and 
they have no military group supporting 

70
00:03:58,791 --> 00:04:00,110
them.
Despite all of this,

71
00:04:00,111 --> 00:04:02,690
the government keeps saying that all 
these politicians,

72
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:03,533
all the real instigators of the country,
street violence and live in a country 

73
00:04:12,511 --> 00:04:16,020
where people need a full day's wages to 
get a bag of onions.

74
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:20,070
It's absolutely normal that people would
want to organize demonstrations.

75
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:21,060
Oh,
and to add to this,

76
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:24,390
the fact that Caracas is the most 
violent city in all of Latin America,

77
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,500
and as you'll probably understand why 
most of the protests send up like that.

78
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:33,501
Yeah.
Nonetheless,

79
00:04:35,341 --> 00:04:36,870
according to the government of 
Venezuela,

80
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,704
the clashes between the police and the 
protestors are nothing but the outcome 

81
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:41,244
of bourgeoisie propaganda.
This is why in September of 2015 three 

82
00:04:45,301 --> 00:04:47,460
months before having parliamentary 
elections,

83
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,530
the Venezuelan police arrested Leopoldo 
Lopez,

84
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:51,383
one of the opposition leaders.
The prosecutor claims that this man was 

85
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:57,310
inciting people into violence with these
kinds of statements made on

86
00:04:57,420 --> 00:04:58,253
what's that

87
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:03,480
guts to take me to prison?
Are you waiting for orders from Havana?

88
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:06,900
I'm telling you the truth is on our 
side,

89
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:12,580
but

90
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:13,413
the turning points would come later in 
December of 2015 at this time at 

91
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:18,084
Venezuela has parliamentary elections,
and as you can imagine that the 

92
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:25,090
opposition party is unified in the so 
called Table of Democratic Unity,

93
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:30,240
Aka the mud beats him do a rose party by
over 2 million votes.

94
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,413
The president's reaction was actually 
what you'd expect from every democratic 

95
00:05:33,941 --> 00:05:38,260
leader.
Recognize this outcome.

96
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,153
Even if we don't like it,
we accept it and we say that democracy 

97
00:05:43,571 --> 00:05:46,180
and the constitution or the real winners
here,

98
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,250
hold on for just a moment because this 
is when the problem starts.

99
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:52,293
This brands,
new nt government parliament started 

100
00:05:54,101 --> 00:05:57,770
trying to impeach the president and this
is where all of a sudden,

101
00:05:57,771 --> 00:06:00,860
but during and his ministers made a 
radical shift.

102
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:03,613
Economic war has influenced a big share 
of our population and this turned the 

103
00:06:07,971 --> 00:06:09,730
public opinion.
During this time,

104
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:10,583
Nicolas and the dirt road tried to 
dissolve parliament according to his 

105
00:06:12,861 --> 00:06:13,280
government.

106
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:14,113
Some of those mps had been elected by 
cheating in the electoral process and 

107
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:20,990
not even the supreme court in Venezuela 
excepted this version.

108
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:26,200
This is why on May the first 2017 maduro
made his final decision draw,

109
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:34,910
calling up the constitutional power to 
get the piece.

110
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:35,833
This republic needs to beat the fascist 
coup and let the people bring the 

111
00:06:40,161 --> 00:06:43,160
harmony and the actual national 
dialogue.

112
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,233
And otherwise my delray wants a new 
parliament and writing brands new 

113
00:06:46,341 --> 00:06:49,700
constitution,
which would give him unlimited power and

114
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:53,180
this would be the ultimate step for 
creating a dictatorship.

115
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,090
And does he might.
Well now one's Ed.

116
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,160
Is this going to be through an election?
Well,

117
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,450
theoretically,
yes,

118
00:07:03,451 --> 00:07:04,284
but the truth is that since 2015 there 
are lots of opposition leaders behind 

119
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,330
bars.
And so,

120
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:10,530
well,
what about the media?

121
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:13,590
Badori supporters say that Venezuela has
freedom of speech,

122
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,960
but is this really true?
Well,

123
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:20,990
let's have a look at that.
Their freedom of speech in Venezuela,

124
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,480
according to the Curran's Venezuelan 
constitution,

125
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:27,940
freedom of speech is a fundamental 
right.

126
00:07:27,970 --> 00:07:28,803
And yes,
there are many newspapers who opposed 

127
00:07:30,211 --> 00:07:31,044
then you've governments.
But guess what the problem these 

128
00:07:32,681 --> 00:07:33,514
newspapers have is,
well they don't actually have any paper 

129
00:07:35,801 --> 00:07:37,540
on which to print their new

130
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:45,490
just like that in Venezuela paper is a 
monopoly regulated by the state.

131
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,320
And this is why gay media outlets like 
El now cnl,

132
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,520
which is contrary to Maduro,
has to reduce their circulation.

133
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:52,533
And even the number of pages in their 
newspaper other day lease of had to 

134
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:58,540
become weeklies because they couldn't 
print so many papers.

135
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:01,120
And now you might be wondering,
well what about the incident?

136
00:08:01,121 --> 00:08:03,400
I mean who even reads print papers 
anymore?

137
00:08:03,460 --> 00:08:04,293
Well,
unfortunately maduro and is governments 

138
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:08,290
have absolute power to block any 
website.

139
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:11,350
Have you ever heard of the site?
Basically this is a site where you could

140
00:08:11,351 --> 00:08:13,390
put the link for any page and it makes 
it shorter.

141
00:08:13,391 --> 00:08:16,860
So you can tweet it easily.
Does it sound counterrevolution reading?

142
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,400
Well,
check this out.

143
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,600
Leave shortcuts are banned in Venezuela.
As you can imagine,

144
00:08:23,601 --> 00:08:24,434
if Britney is forbid,
an other critical websites like CNN 

145
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:30,110
dollars a day or info bae up or say 
bands.

146
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:32,690
If you live in Venezuela and you want to
visit these websites,

147
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,570
you must do it through a proxy.
Just like in China.

148
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:36,553
And of course,
don't forget that there have been more 

149
00:08:37,431 --> 00:08:41,570
than 40 journalists threatened by the 
government's allies or even worse,

150
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:44,430
six

151
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:49,200
twitter users are in jail in Venezuela 
for giving their political opinions.

152
00:08:49,350 --> 00:08:49,830
Yup.
Yeah,

153
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:52,470
that rights they on knots being judged 
or fines.

154
00:08:52,471 --> 00:08:53,304
They are in prison.
But hold on for just minute because all 

155
00:08:55,891 --> 00:08:59,330
of this is nothing compared to what's 
happening in television.

156
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,293
And you got to call me for decades.
Caracas was the Hollywood of South 

157
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:07,343
American soap operas.
Venezuela was famous for having lots of 

158
00:09:09,691 --> 00:09:12,780
private TV stations.
And of course some of them were contrary

159
00:09:12,781 --> 00:09:16,440
to Madurai as governments.
The Venezuelan Constitution provides for

160
00:09:16,441 --> 00:09:18,970
freedom of speech on tv,
but on the other hands,

161
00:09:19,010 --> 00:09:19,843
the law of forces them to broadcast all 
of the president's speeches and we're 

162
00:09:22,981 --> 00:09:23,814
not talking about one show a year.
Maduro appears on TV several times a 

163
00:09:27,631 --> 00:09:28,464
week and the TVS have to make a break 
matter their schedule and broadcast the 

164
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:33,414
presidential speech.
Sometimes these speeches can last for 

165
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:39,030
hours and add to this other stories like
this one.

166
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:45,950
No bovie Xian,
a Venezuelan TV broadcaster is sold to a

167
00:09:45,951 --> 00:09:49,670
new owner who promises a new,
more moderate ideology.

168
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:53,180
Before medallia was the president's 
during the times of Hugo Chavez glade,

169
00:09:53,210 --> 00:09:56,780
the vision was a diehard antigovernment 
TV station,

170
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:57,853
but all of a sudden it was sold in 2013 
in the new owners had close ties with 

171
00:10:01,101 --> 00:10:01,934
the presidents.
So the first thing they did when they 

172
00:10:03,591 --> 00:10:04,424
took control of the company,
it was to fire half of the staff and 

173
00:10:07,011 --> 00:10:07,844
then no surprise,
surprise and global vision became a 

174
00:10:09,771 --> 00:10:10,510
centrist

175
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,343
station

176
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,040
making a mistake.
This is merely one example.

177
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:17,933
Today there is almost no media in 
Venezuela that is critical of the 

178
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:21,234
government.
So the question I would now like to ask 

179
00:10:22,921 --> 00:10:23,754
you is this,
what exactly is the difference between 

180
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:26,994
Nicolas Maduro and any other dictator?
Can anybody claim Venezuela is still 

181
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,700
really a democracy?
Well,

182
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:34,380
we'd love to know what you think,
