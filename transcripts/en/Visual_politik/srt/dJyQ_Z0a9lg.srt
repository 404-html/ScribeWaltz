1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:05,360
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:11,330
Any of you have asked us for a video 
explaining what communism is all about,

3
00:00:11,540 --> 00:00:15,020
so well paired is if you have been 
following this channel for a while,

4
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:15,854
you'll probably know that when not 
exactly on the communist side of the 

5
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:19,874
spectrum,
but before having an opinion about 

6
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,184
something.
It's important to be informed about 

7
00:00:23,631 --> 00:00:24,111
this.
Plus,

8
00:00:24,111 --> 00:00:24,944
at the end of this video,
we're going to share some takeaways 

9
00:00:26,481 --> 00:00:29,150
about mocks that just might surprise 
you.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,740
The Internet is full of trolls who will 
either sing marks his praises or hate on

11
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:36,010
him without ever having read it.

12
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:38,910
[inaudible]

13
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:40,473
it's why people ends up in leaving quite
a lot of stereotypes about communism 

14
00:00:43,510 --> 00:00:45,070
that's simply on true.
Now,

15
00:00:45,071 --> 00:00:45,904
before I saw it,
I will say that this is a summary of 

16
00:00:47,981 --> 00:00:52,000
Friedrich Engels and column boxes ideas 
on communism only.

17
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:53,073
We've only got 10 minutes,
so it's going to be impossible to cover 

18
00:00:54,941 --> 00:00:58,360
authors who came after or the politics 
of the Soviet Union.

19
00:00:58,540 --> 00:01:01,090
But with that out of the way,
let's get started.

20
00:01:04,020 --> 00:01:04,590
The first thing

21
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:05,423
you need to know that may surprise you 
is that mark's was eight materialist of 

22
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:10,483
thinker.
That means that he thinks the main 

23
00:01:12,151 --> 00:01:15,600
driver of social change is material 
goods.

24
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,673
The foundation of Marxism is to 
determine which goods have more value 

25
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,204
than other goods,
but it do be warns here that we are 

26
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:26,220
talking about value,
not a balanced price.

27
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:30,060
Price can be influenced by other things 
such as taxes or monopolies.

28
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,393
For Marx,
the value with the good is measured by 

29
00:01:36,171 --> 00:01:39,950
the work needed to manufacture it.
So for an example,

30
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:40,843
how much is a chair with it would be the
sum of the carbons does working hours 

31
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:44,744
who put the chat together as well as the
some of the working hours of the 

32
00:01:46,941 --> 00:01:47,774
lumberjack.
You cut down the tree as well as the 

33
00:01:49,311 --> 00:01:50,144
some of the working hours of the 
blacksmith who made the nails that went 

34
00:01:52,671 --> 00:01:56,840
into the chair and this goes on man's 
almonds on in summary,

35
00:01:56,841 --> 00:02:01,670
it's all the work of all the people who 
went in to making it as the chair.

36
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:02,773
Don't forget this because it's very 
important in understanding the idea of 

37
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:07,124
capitalist exploitation and though this 
has nothing to do with working hours or 

38
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:11,960
worker's condition

39
00:02:13,930 --> 00:02:15,340
[inaudible]

40
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:18,990
it's the wealthier is this some under 
mocks?

41
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:21,930
The welfare is the sum of all these 
people's work,

42
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:23,760
right,
but these people,

43
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:27,390
they only get a share of the wealth of 
that they create.

44
00:02:27,570 --> 00:02:29,580
The rest is profit for the factories.

45
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,840
This one

46
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:33,673
needs that.
If these people are working eight hours 

47
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:36,890
a day,
they're only getting a fraction of that.

48
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:39,290
Maybe the first three or four hours 
work.

49
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:40,363
The other part,
the part that the businessmen receives 

50
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,760
is cold substance.

51
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:47,110
Bye.
Their produce

52
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:47,943
value.
He's there for the exact expression of 

53
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:51,394
the expectation,
the glory of the working force by the 

54
00:02:53,351 --> 00:02:54,184
Capitol or the worker by the capitalist.
So something you might be wondering how 

55
00:02:58,211 --> 00:03:02,110
is it possible the business owner to 
exploit the workers so easily?

56
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,560
Why on the workers getting the whole 
value that they're generating?

57
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:06,663
The answer is because they don't have 
the tools required to take the raw 

58
00:03:08,891 --> 00:03:11,310
materials and turn them into a finished 
product,

59
00:03:11,311 --> 00:03:12,460
a factory,
a workshop,

60
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:14,000
whatever.
This is Marty.

61
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:19,001
An economic jargon is called the means 
of production or capital means.

62
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:20,343
In fact,
this is why the person who owns these 

63
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:24,670
things is often called a capitalist.
Now,

64
00:03:24,671 --> 00:03:27,280
despite what some people think marks has
no problem.

65
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:31,150
If you want to own a fancy car or a 
really expensive mobile phone,

66
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,133
he just has a problem.
If you want to own the means of 

67
00:03:34,361 --> 00:03:36,940
production,
this means having a company.

68
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:39,370
But why is this a problem?
Well,

69
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,263
let's take a look.

70
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:42,480
[inaudible]

71
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,490
[inaudible] of capitalism

72
00:03:45,060 --> 00:03:48,150
now mocks divide society into two 
classes.

73
00:03:48,330 --> 00:03:50,200
On the one hand you have the 
capitalists,

74
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,053
the bourgeoisie,
and on the other hand you have the one 

75
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:53,774
that gives the pro to terry at the 
bourgeoisie own the production process 

76
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,073
and they exploit the workers.
The workers are the ones who were doing 

77
00:04:01,021 --> 00:04:01,854
the work and making the value,
but they only get the bread crumbs from 

78
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:05,910
the bourgeoisie.
Therefore,

79
00:04:05,911 --> 00:04:10,230
we have a confrontation or why you might
have heard of a class struggle,

80
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:14,520
and this is what Marx defines as the 
original sin of a market economy.

81
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:15,473
And as you can clearly see,
it has nothing to do with poverty or 

82
00:04:17,791 --> 00:04:19,080
inequality.
In fact,

83
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:19,923
in Nordic countries where the difference
between the wealthy and the poor is not 

84
00:04:22,801 --> 00:04:23,634
so great,
there is still capitalist exploitation 

85
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:30,270
as long as the means of production is in
private hands.

86
00:04:30,750 --> 00:04:32,670
This is why [inaudible] doesn't just 
focus.

87
00:04:32,671 --> 00:04:36,000
His criticism was on capitalists,
but also on Social Democrat

88
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,100
[inaudible]

89
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,753
that'd be less systematic,
but yet more practical of socialism 

90
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:47,110
dries to freeze any revolutionary wheel 
from the working class.

91
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:50,950
Claiming it is not a political reform 
that will give them benefit,

92
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:54,640
but only the modification of their 
material life conditions.

93
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,683
In summary,
the working relations of capitalism are 

94
00:04:57,461 --> 00:05:00,400
based on one group living off another 
group.

95
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:04,360
This is what Marx calls the 
infrastructure of capitalism.

96
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,220
Nevertheless,
in order to make this work,

97
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,054
the bourgeoisie,
you need some sort of secret weapon to 

98
00:05:08,801 --> 00:05:11,800
keep that supremacy.
That's why they create a government.

99
00:05:11,801 --> 00:05:14,500
They create laws,
they create even religion.

100
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,560
This is what Marx calls at the 
superstructure,

101
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,513
also known as a cultural hegemony.
So what is Marxists solution to end all 

102
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:23,164
of this injustice?

103
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:26,400
Girls Revolution.

104
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:29,950
Further Marx believes that capitalism is
unsuspecting

105
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,690
[inaudible]

106
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:33,973
claim that their goals can be only 
achieved by the violin over throat of 

107
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,980
every existence,
social order.

108
00:05:40,220 --> 00:05:41,053
In fact,
he even predicts that the first 

109
00:05:41,901 --> 00:05:45,950
countries to fall will be the biggest 
industrial nations specific green.

110
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,930
He predicts the fall of the United 
Kingdom,

111
00:05:47,931 --> 00:05:50,320
which was the leading industrial nation 
of Islam,

112
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,313
right?

113
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,840
He's 14 their own destruction and their 
own undertaker.

114
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,100
The proletariat

115
00:05:58,340 --> 00:06:01,730
boss here is the most ironic part of the
story.

116
00:06:01,940 --> 00:06:02,773
If you look at all the facts,
the countries that have had marxists 

117
00:06:04,811 --> 00:06:05,644
revolutions are things that never had an
industrial revolution and never had a 

118
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,723
bourgeoisie.
These are countries like Russia or 

119
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:13,940
China,
which never had a capitalist system,

120
00:06:14,090 --> 00:06:14,923
at least how mark's defined it,
those countries with advanced 

121
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:19,160
capitalism,
it never even had a revolution.

122
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,250
Maybe the only exceptions would be 
Hungary and Czechoslovakia,

123
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,520
but these were cases where communism 
didn't come through a revolution,

124
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,830
but by the USA army invading those

125
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,480
[inaudible]

126
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:33,950
key question,
the boxes.

127
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:38,170
Philosophers wonder during the 20th 
century is where is the revolution?

128
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:41,050
The marks promised us.
This is a question that many people have

129
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:41,884
tried to answer to philosophers that I 
would specifically recommend reading on 

130
00:06:44,801 --> 00:06:48,160
this topic are yoga and the harbor mass 
and then turn to your grand scheme.

131
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:49,083
They looked at human language as well as
how humans perceive reality to see why 

132
00:06:52,301 --> 00:06:54,760
we haven't had this revolution.
Interestingly,

133
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,623
this research has even been useful in 
possibly the least boxes thing you can 

134
00:06:58,901 --> 00:06:59,734
imagine.

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,220
[inaudible]

136
00:07:03,570 --> 00:07:06,030
that is definitely something we are not 
going to address in this video,

137
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:09,150
but we'll save it for a future video.

138
00:07:09,151 --> 00:07:11,400

If you are interested in finding out 
more about this topic now,

140
00:07:14,941 --> 00:07:17,490
then you can check out a book written on
the subjects,

141
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:21,900
but unfortunately it's only in Spanish,
but it is written by one of the hosts of

142
00:07:21,901 --> 00:07:25,680
the Spanish visual politic channel.
Send your funds sacker but as I said,

143
00:07:25,681 --> 00:07:28,260
it's definitely something we'll consider
addressing in a future video.

144
00:07:28,950 --> 00:07:31,240
[inaudible]

145
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:32,923
shed our opinion with you,
but what do you think of Marx's 

146
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,670
theories?
Do you think that they're still relevant

147
00:07:37,671 --> 00:07:40,760
in the world we live in today?
Let us know in the comments below.
