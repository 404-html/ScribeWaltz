1
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:11,540
Nice to economics,
what Axel rose is to the music industry,

2
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:14,600
rocks in the late eighties and the 
beginning of the nineties.

3
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:15,613
Then they started losing grounds and 
nowadays anytime they try to make a 

4
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,470
comeback,
the results are pretty disappointing.

5
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:32,930
I know you're thinking of first glance.
Japan doesn't seem to be that bad,

6
00:00:32,931 --> 00:00:34,760
right?
I mean they have the video games,

7
00:00:34,761 --> 00:00:39,761
the enemy movies and world class tech 
Bam offs and cameras or Tokyo that looks

8
00:00:40,161 --> 00:00:43,640
like a city.
It's the world's biggest metropolis with

9
00:00:43,641 --> 00:00:46,280
over $30 million people.
Then they have the fastest trains,

10
00:00:46,281 --> 00:00:50,180
the most modern tvs and even human like 
robots.

11
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:51,073
Nonetheless,
this country has gone through two 

12
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:57,350
decades without any economic growth and 
I saw the worst of us.

13
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,213
Japan is the most indebted country in 
the world because they are more than 

14
00:01:01,221 --> 00:01:02,054
twice their entire GDP and the 
population is increasing faster than 

15
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,043
anywhere else.
Which poses a big problem when it comes 

16
00:01:07,761 --> 00:01:08,594
to paying for retirement pensions.
This is one of the reasons why Japanese 

17
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,074
workers have crazy hours and almost no 
vacation time and those good old 

18
00:01:15,321 --> 00:01:16,154
technological juggernauts like a touch 
or panasonic or falling behind the more 

19
00:01:19,461 --> 00:01:24,461
modern companies from China and America.
Hold on a second because things,

20
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,220
they might be on the verge of change.
Yes.

21
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:33,650
I'm talking here about the Tokyo 
Olympics.

22
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,140
Do you take place in 20,
20?

23
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,123
It's an opportunity to showcase their 
entire country and get the world's 

24
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:50,840
attention.
Yes.

25
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:54,560
Did you ever since Japan won the Olympic
bid in 2013,

26
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:57,290
tourism has absolutely skyrocketed

27
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,160
and the same goes with private 
investment.

28
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,053
By the year 20,
20 Tokyo will have 45 brand new 

29
00:02:03,001 --> 00:02:08,001
skyscraper.
Nice.

30
00:02:09,250 --> 00:02:10,083
Like Panasonic will set state of the art
solar cells in increasing location so 

31
00:02:13,931 --> 00:02:17,680
people can charge their electric cars 
anywhere and if this wasn't enough,

32
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:22,060
Sony will launch their brand new eight k
TV screens.

33
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:23,260
Yes.
You had that right?

34
00:02:23,261 --> 00:02:25,340
Soon enough.
We are going to have eight cases.

35
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:28,900
You can see every microfiber of the 
athletes shirts,

36
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,580
but hold on for just a second ed,
because not everything is so beautiful.

37
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:35,980
You see,
when Tokyo won the Olympic bid,

38
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:39,460
they had budgeted six point 5 billion 
American dollars,

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:40,353
but since they started building,
the costs have doubled and they haven't 

40
00:02:43,991 --> 00:02:44,830
even finished.
Yes.

41
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,753
In fact,
Tokyo City Hall has predicted that the 

42
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:51,190
total cost might be up to around 20 
billion USD,

43
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:54,910
so the question is on the Olympic Games,
actually an opportunity for Japan,

44
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:55,773
or quite the opposite,
are the Olympic Games as good for a 

45
00:02:58,481 --> 00:03:00,700
country's,
as people say,

46
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,653
well,
today we are going to answer these 

47
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:05,110
questions,
but as we always do,

48
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:06,243
let's take a look.
First back at the history Olympic 

49
00:03:10,211 --> 00:03:11,044
fallacy.
Very few things spark national pride 

50
00:03:13,511 --> 00:03:16,120
quite as much as the Olympic Games.
Of course,

51
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:16,954
we all like to brag about the gold 
medals on country has less water really 

52
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:24,790
inflames patriotism the most.
It's becoming an Olympic host.

53
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:31,980
The excitement,
it generates this so big that everyone,

54
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:32,814
regardless of their ideology,
seems to think that organizing an event 

55
00:03:35,521 --> 00:03:37,680
for this length,
the country is a good thing,

56
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:40,410
but from an economic standpoint,
things up.

57
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:41,880
Not that clear.
In fact,

58
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:45,450
the arguments in favor of hosting the 
Olympic Games are a little bit like,

59
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:46,800
how should we say?
Well,

60
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:50,370
there is inconsistent as a tweet,
Donald Trump,

61
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,770
according to a paper from the Bank of 
Japan,

62
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:53,663
the effects of the Olympics are so 
positive that they can be filled even 

63
00:03:56,851 --> 00:03:58,620
before the Olympics takes place.

64
00:04:02,890 --> 00:04:07,070
More specifically the same year,
the International Olympic Committee name

65
00:04:07,071 --> 00:04:11,740
Tokyo as the host city.
Many started to see Japan as the perfect

66
00:04:11,741 --> 00:04:12,574
place for investment.
Remember that we're talking about a 

67
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:18,660
paper from an institution as prestigious
as the Bank of Japan.

68
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,553
This is basically the Japanese 
equivalent to the American Federal 

69
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,491
Reserve.
That said,

70
00:04:23,491 --> 00:04:24,324
one of their main arguments is that if 
your city gets to the common Olympic 

71
00:04:27,211 --> 00:04:29,400
host,
the whole country can join all those big

72
00:04:29,401 --> 00:04:31,830
organizations that every country wants 
to be a member of.

73
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,200
So how about an example?
Well,

74
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,510
Barcelona got the nomination in 1986.
Some theme that very same.

75
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:38,070
Yes.
Spain joined the EU.

76
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,083
Beijing was nominated in 2001 and then 
again they joined the World Trade 

77
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,553
Organization that very year.
It seems like this line of reasoning is 

78
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:45,804
pretty bulletproof,
but just hold on a second because this 

79
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:51,210
is a textbook example of something 
called correlation fallacy.

80
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:52,223
In other words,
the fact that Spain joined the EU the 

81
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:54,713
same year the Barcelona got chosen as 
the Olympic host does not mean that the 

82
00:04:58,141 --> 00:04:59,700
one thing caused the other.
In fact,

83
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:03,780
Portugal also joined the EU in the same 
year and they didn't post anything

84
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,640
and the same will happen with China.
At the same time,

85
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:10,503
other Asian countries joined the WTO 
without organizing benny sporting 

86
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:14,350
events.
Now,

87
00:05:14,351 --> 00:05:15,440
just hold on a second.
He's like,

88
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:17,470
probably know what you're thinking right
about now when you're probably thinking,

89
00:05:17,471 --> 00:05:18,310
well,
Hey Simon,

90
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,290
well,
what about other international attention

91
00:05:20,291 --> 00:05:21,124
that the Olympic Games can bring?
I mean for two whole weeks the whole 

92
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:25,100
world is going to have their eyes on 
Japan.

93
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:26,710
That's got to be a good thing.
Rice,

94
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,540
I mean,
we're talking about the biggest sporting

95
00:05:28,541 --> 00:05:30,250
event in the world.
Well,

96
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,233
maybe not.
Once you see the London Olympics in 

97
00:05:32,711 --> 00:05:35,050
2012,
I got a pretty average audience.

98
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:37,450
I mean around 31 million Americans.
To you,

99
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:43,660
it's

100
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,493
making comparison.
This is twice as much as an episode of 

101
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:49,740
game of thrones and that wasn't exactly 
being regarded as bas,

102
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,870
but well,
what about the rest of the Games now?

103
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,733
The Olympics in 2014 didn't even have 22
million viewers in the United States in 

104
00:05:56,791 --> 00:05:57,920
Rio.
20 16.

105
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,833
I was just 26 million,
so now these numbers might look quite 

106
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:04,040
big to you right now,
but it's really nothing if we compare it

107
00:06:04,041 --> 00:06:06,140
to a much cheaper events like the super 
bowl.

108
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:10,023
Okay.

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,770
The 2016 superbowl surpassed a hundred 
and 10 million viewers.

110
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:15,753
In other words,
even though the Olympics or watched all 

111
00:06:17,561 --> 00:06:19,330
around the world,
when you look at the audience,

112
00:06:19,331 --> 00:06:20,164
country by country,
the figures aren't really that 

113
00:06:21,641 --> 00:06:22,474
impressive and this means that the 
perception people have about that 

114
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:25,773
country doesn't really change.
The state doesn't really seem to change 

115
00:06:28,990 --> 00:06:29,823
for the good.

116
00:06:31,030 --> 00:06:34,820
A study of the impact of the 2000 
Olympics in Sydney.

117
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:35,953
Australian researchers interviewed 
people one year before and after the 

118
00:06:39,681 --> 00:06:44,360
games they found a little change in 
perceptions with one surprising wrinkle.

119
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:45,403
South Africans were displeased with 
Australia because of the way in which 

120
00:06:49,401 --> 00:06:53,930
the aboriginal issue was highlighted and
portrayed by the South African.

121
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:01,320
Nonetheless,
there is one thing that it seems fair to

122
00:07:01,321 --> 00:07:05,220
agree on Olympic Games do.
Kickstart your tourism industry.

123
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:06,143
Actually,
since Tokyo was chosen as the Olympic 

124
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:09,900
coast tourism in Japan has absolutely 
skyrocketed.

125
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:13,050
I mean they almost didn't have any 
tourists since 2013,

126
00:07:13,170 --> 00:07:16,110
but last year they support 24 million 
people.

127
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,390
You could say essentially a brand new 
industry.

128
00:07:18,391 --> 00:07:20,790
It's just been born in Japan and 
tourism.

129
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,090
Tourism is an industry that attracts a 
lot of foreign money and our money.

130
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:27,810
I mean,
got to be a good thing.

131
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:28,920
Right.
Well,

132
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,873
I can't just hold on a minute because 
even these figures that are up for 

133
00:07:33,181 --> 00:07:34,950
debate,
of course tourism in Japan,

134
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:35,843
it's increased a lot,
but do you know of some other countries 

135
00:07:38,071 --> 00:07:40,440
that also have a booming tourist section
right now?

136
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:43,140
Well,
shelley and Thailand are great examples.

137
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,103
They have grown at a similar rate to 
Japan and don't even Google it because 

138
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:47,934
I'm going to tell you right now,
neither of these countries is planning 

139
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,780
to host the Olympic Games anytime soon.

140
00:07:55,930 --> 00:07:58,090
Did Thailand's example is pretty 
paradigmatic.

141
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,983
They get 6 million more tourists than 
Japan each year and they have just 

142
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,484
popped population and their tourism.
Grief is directly correlated to that of 

143
00:08:06,641 --> 00:08:09,160
the Chinese middle class.
In other words,

144
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,053
as Chinese people have more money,
they want to do more sightseeing and 

145
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:14,800
well,
where do they go?

146
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:17,560
Well,
they go to countries that are nearby and

147
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:19,560
it's a beautiful things to see.
All right.

148
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,950
All right,
so now you might be thinking,

149
00:08:20,951 --> 00:08:21,784
well,
even if the Olympics aren't as 

150
00:08:22,661 --> 00:08:24,550
profitable as they seem,
well,

151
00:08:24,551 --> 00:08:27,190
what's the problem?
If Tokyo wants to host the Olympics,

152
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:30,130
I mean he doesn't like having a giant 
stadium in his city.

153
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:31,720
Well,
that's inclusive.

154
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:32,770
Look at that one too.

155
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:38,860
Medalists in spending.

156
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:42,270
Now we all know that the Olympics are 
costly from one day to the next.

157
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,104
Okay.
Basically went from not having to have 

158
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:44,814
an Olympic stadiums,
so having to have one which has to hold 

159
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:48,870
more than 80,000
people and also,

160
00:08:48,890 --> 00:08:49,723
I mean they have to impress everyone 
with lights and colors and all sorts of 

161
00:08:52,291 --> 00:08:54,690
fancy things,
but it doesn't stop there.

162
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,613
I mean they also need other special 
venues for the mini competitions that 

163
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,214
are held at the same time.
Each of the sports has its own 

164
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,143
specifications in total.
Thirty one venues will need to be built 

165
00:09:05,791 --> 00:09:09,630
or remodels for the Tokyo 20,
20 summer Olympic Games.

166
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:10,563
Yes.

167
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:14,273
And then there's a media center and 
other giant white elephants ends on top 

168
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:17,850
of that.
There's the Olympic villa.

169
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:21,540
The Olympic villa is basically nothing 
short of a small town where 10,000

170
00:09:21,541 --> 00:09:22,374
athletes are going to live during the 
Olympics and as you can probably 

171
00:09:24,511 --> 00:09:27,120
imagine,
this is certainly not going to be cheap.

172
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,133
Now remember at the total cost for this,
we're supposed to be at six point 5 

173
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,973
billion USD.
At least this was the figure given by 

174
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:37,560
the local authorities to the 
International Olympic Committee in 2013.

175
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:38,873
But as you know,
theories are one thing and reality is 

176
00:09:41,851 --> 00:09:43,380
something completely different.

177
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:50,610
Pure 20,
20 Olympic Games costs just keep rising.

178
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:51,573
By December 2017,
Tokyo City Hall had already spent over 

179
00:09:54,401 --> 00:09:55,234
$12,000,000,000
and just a couple of months later the 

180
00:09:58,991 --> 00:09:59,824
local authorities report is that they 
would end up spending a whopping figure 

181
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,173
of at least $20,000,000,000
and is even possible that this figure 

182
00:10:07,511 --> 00:10:11,080
will keep rising before they even begin 
to burn the Olympic flame.

183
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:13,630
But I mean none of this is really a 
surprise

184
00:10:13,780 --> 00:10:18,100
since he can remember every Olympic game
has had significant cost overruns.

185
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:22,633
Rio De Janeiro,
2016 ended up costing 51 percent more 

186
00:10:26,331 --> 00:10:30,170
than expected.
But the record so far is Montreal.

187
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:31,004
Nineteen 76,
which costs 700 percent more than was 

188
00:10:34,431 --> 00:10:36,290
initially budgeted.
You heard that right?

189
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,530
Eight times more than what was first 
planned.

190
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:39,980
All right,
so now you might be wondering,

191
00:10:39,981 --> 00:10:40,700
well,
how these

192
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,533
billions of dollars really all that much
money for a big governments and you 

193
00:10:45,141 --> 00:10:47,360
compared with normal spending in a big 
city whole,

194
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,490
is that actually a lot of money?
Well,

195
00:10:49,491 --> 00:10:50,324
the answer to that is an absolutely 
resounding yes for better understanding 

196
00:10:53,751 --> 00:10:56,900
with $20 million US dollars,
you could build a highway that connected

197
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:01,790
the extreme north of Japan to the 
extreme south and that really isn't even

198
00:11:01,791 --> 00:11:06,791
the worst of it.
You see an apple for a highway.

199
00:11:08,511 --> 00:11:12,770
It can ends up being a waste of money,
but still you can always reutilize this.

200
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:13,663
A country with best,
better infrastructure and communication 

201
00:11:14,991 --> 00:11:17,690
can have better companies in the future.
Brand new industries,

202
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:21,290
a better public services.
What do you get with an Olympic stadium?

203
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:22,610
The Coin Heist?
80,000

204
00:11:22,611 --> 00:11:23,660
people.
Well,

205
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:26,180
if we look at past examples of the 
answer to that question,

206
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:27,073
it's pretty bleak.

207
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:33,960
Olympic venues already falling into a 
state of disrepair.

208
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:36,870
The Rio de Janeiro example is 
particularly harsh.

209
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:37,793
Despite hosting the Olympics.
They still have entire neighborhoods 

210
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,970
that aren't even connected to the city 
center by a bus line and the place where

211
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,220
the Olympic villa was.
Well,

212
00:11:46,221 --> 00:11:49,950
that's becoming a slum and this is not 
the only example.

213
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,560
Athens Olympic in ruins 10 years on from
the 2004 games.

214
00:11:56,790 --> 00:11:57,623
Yeah,

215
00:11:58,020 --> 00:11:58,853
and then you've got to add to all of 
this that Japan is the most indebted 

216
00:12:00,841 --> 00:12:01,674
country on the planet.
They owe us some equivalent to 130 

217
00:12:04,231 --> 00:12:05,064
percent of their GDP to government is 
already struggling to pay retirement 

218
00:12:07,561 --> 00:12:08,394
pensions and they've already been two 
years without any economic growth 

219
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:12,443
whatsoever,

220
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:17,713
but now I would say what to you?
Do you think that the Tokyo Olympics in 

221
00:12:20,361 --> 00:12:24,320
2020 will mean the ruin of Japan or 
maybe against the odds?

222
00:12:24,321 --> 00:12:25,154
Do you think Japan will benefit from 
hosting the events while please leave
