1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,903
In 2017,
it'll be 70 years since India broke off 

2
00:00:11,611 --> 00:00:14,460
from the British empire and became an 
independent country,

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:18,000
which is today actually the largest 
democracy in the world.

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:18,923
In these 70 years,
India has managed to implement a 

5
00:00:20,701 --> 00:00:25,320
political system with more than 1000 
parties and high female participation.

6
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,210
That is totally unprecedented in such a 
poor

7
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:29,083
country.

8
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:33,323
Of course,
we should probably wait before we pop 

9
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:35,394
the champagne because we can't exactly 
say that these 70 years of independence 

10
00:00:38,641 --> 00:00:39,474
have gone brilliantly in this gigantic 
country of more than one point 2 

11
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,110
billion.
What's the equality?

12
00:00:46,111 --> 00:00:46,944
A terrible cost system and many,
many problems with women's rights have 

13
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:54,990
continued to shake this nation.
That's for wars with Pakistan,

14
00:00:54,991 --> 00:00:57,530
which has become something of a arch 
enemy.

15
00:00:57,730 --> 00:00:58,563
Yeah,

16
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,800
but if you really want to know why we 
might claim that India can't be proud of

17
00:01:04,801 --> 00:01:06,270
the last 70 years.
Well,

18
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:11,220
we only need to compare this country's 
evolution with that of China Sea.

19
00:01:11,221 --> 00:01:15,020
When Dung shopping launched his policy 
to open up China to the world and change

20
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,100
the economic model back in the 19 
eighties,

21
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:20,850
the sizes of these two economic giants.
China and India,

22
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,490
they were similar in 2016.
However,

23
00:01:23,491 --> 00:01:26,250
the China's GDP,
it was five times higher.

24
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:27,340
I mean,
just check out this

25
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,373
graph

26
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,040
and not only that,
these differences repeats in practically

27
00:01:36,100 --> 00:01:39,260
every statistic,
social and economic and Tobias,

28
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:40,290
another example.
Well,

29
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:43,870
while China's illiteracy rate affects 
less than four percent of the population

30
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,733
in China,
almost a one out of every three people 

31
00:01:46,931 --> 00:01:51,931
can't read or write.
Considering all this,

32
00:01:53,611 --> 00:01:54,444
we should almost reached the conclusion 
that the only good thing that this 

33
00:01:56,581 --> 00:01:58,080
country has achieved,
it hasn't been.

34
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:59,310
It's democracy,
right?

35
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:00,653
Just a second,
because it seems that this poverty and 

36
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:07,581
injustice is beginning to shift for 
experts,

37
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:14,910
so betting that the 21st century will be
above all India century.

38
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,950
That is to say that in the next few 
decades,

39
00:02:16,951 --> 00:02:17,784
we'll witness how this country emerges 
from the developing world to become an 

40
00:02:21,150 --> 00:02:21,983
economic superpower.
Many companies such as Amazon and apple 

41
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:25,103
already betting on this transformation,
ends up paying close attention to this 

42
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:32,280
huge market.
They understand that if expectations are

43
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,820
mess in the next few years,
we could see one of the biggest business

44
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:37,170
opportunities in history.

45
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,510
Great,

46
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:41,593
and it's not just companies,
the Deli government's own expectations 

47
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:44,444
are so high that they expect this 
country's transformation to be at least 

48
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,150
as impressive as that of China in the 
coming decades.

49
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,380
For this reason,
they want to be prepared.

50
00:02:54,410 --> 00:02:56,030
They are contemplating,
for example,

51
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:59,120
building 250 airports,
six new macro reports,

52
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:00,003
and creating more than $150,
million new and accessible homes in the 

53
00:03:03,581 --> 00:03:08,470
next 10 years.
In other words,

54
00:03:08,471 --> 00:03:11,440
everything indicates that we may see 
India's takeoff,

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,333
which,
well,

56
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:14,020
that's got to be a good thing,
right?

57
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,913
Well,
do you keep one thing in mind and that 

58
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:18,400
is the Beijing doesn't like this.
They don't like it at all.

59
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:28,680
Crust and resentment

60
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,770
is India's main trading partner.
However,

61
00:03:33,771 --> 00:03:34,604
despite this,
Chinese authorities look at India's 

62
00:03:36,291 --> 00:03:37,910
growing economic,
political,

63
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:40,730
and military capacity with a lot of 
distrust.

64
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,593
This is because this is a time when 
China wants to gain political influence 

65
00:03:44,361 --> 00:03:46,910
and this change in India.
It doesn't suit them at all.

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:47,813
India is perhaps the only country in 
Asia with enough potential to offset 

67
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,390
China's political power in the region.
After all,

68
00:03:53,391 --> 00:03:54,224
we're talking about what will soon be 
the most populated country on earth and 

69
00:03:57,021 --> 00:04:00,470
there's even some analysts who confirmed
that maybe this has already happened,

70
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,460
but India has already surpassed China in
terms of population size,

71
00:04:04,490 --> 00:04:07,940
but it isn't only that because of the 
one child policy that affected China for

72
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:08,774
so many years,
India's population has and will have 

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,180
more young people and less elderly 
people,

74
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:17,990
which is quite a significant advantage 
given these circumstances.

75
00:04:17,991 --> 00:04:20,930
It's easy to understand Beijing's 
distrust of India.

76
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:26,110
Then you agree India has the fastest 
growing economy in the world.

77
00:04:26,331 --> 00:04:27,164
We hope we're going to be catching it 
very soon in terms of percentage 

78
00:04:29,271 --> 00:04:31,790
increase.
I have to tell you that we're working on

79
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:32,624
it now.
Don't think that this feeling only 

80
00:04:34,551 --> 00:04:37,130
exists in political officers,
not at all.

81
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:37,964
In fact,
this growing rivalry is actually also 

82
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:42,550
reflected on the streets.
Consider the following data.

83
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:49,180
According to a survey published in 2016 
by the Pew Research Center that only one

84
00:04:49,181 --> 00:04:53,590
in four Chinese people have a favorable 
opinion of India and in India things are

85
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,424
not more encouraging.
Seven out of every 10 are worried about 

86
00:04:57,251 --> 00:04:58,084
Beijing's military drive and believe 
that China's economic influence is 

87
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:02,290
hurting them.
In other words,

88
00:05:02,291 --> 00:05:03,124
it seems that both China and India as 
populations know that their neighbors 

89
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:06,900
are also.
They're great

90
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:07,823
rivals.

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,260
In any case,
curiously,

92
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:14,640
it must be said that despite all of this
rivalry,

93
00:05:14,641 --> 00:05:16,890
Bollywood is actually quite popular in 
China.

94
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,690
This summer we saw how dangle and Indian
blockbuster swept the Chinese box office

95
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,553
and it became one of the highest 
grossing films in China of all time and 

96
00:05:26,371 --> 00:05:27,390
well,
as you might imagine,

97
00:05:27,391 --> 00:05:29,670
this is something that the government in
Beijing,

98
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,540
they do really like that much in terms 
of soft power.

99
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:34,463
India has done better than China,
although India's economy is not as 

100
00:05:36,961 --> 00:05:39,780
developed.
They've put a huge emphasis on promoting

101
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:41,920
their culture.
John Jean Cui,

102
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,230
director of the Southeast Asian Research
Institute at Peking University.

103
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,093
Well anyway,
it would be great if all tensions 

104
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:50,550
occurred in let's see,
such a peaceful way,

105
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:51,443
but unfortunately that is not the case.
Disputes in is while everyone was 

106
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,114
looking at Pyong Yang and the North 
Korean nuclear crisis occupied every 

107
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:09,984
front page,
another political crisis when it was 

108
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:12,474
about to explode,

109
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:15,933
happens in the Himalayas more than 4,000
meters above sea level in one of the 

110
00:06:19,301 --> 00:06:20,134
most remote places on earth.
That dockland plateau in this place 

111
00:06:24,101 --> 00:06:27,790
between June and August,
one of the most serious political crises

112
00:06:27,791 --> 00:06:28,624
between China and India in the last 55 
years occurred when Chinese troops 

113
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:33,870
invaded northern India.
See,

114
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:35,770
on June the eighth,
2017,

115
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,633
a squad of Chinese border guards into 
construction team entered the territory 

116
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:44,090
that is disputed between China and the 
small closed kingdom of time.

117
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:48,280
That is the country with the highest 
gross national happiness.

118
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:49,450
Yes,
that is something.

119
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:51,530
We will certainly be discussing it a 
video someday,

120
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,443
but well,
the fact is that the Chinese unit's 

121
00:06:53,831 --> 00:06:56,920
destroyed.
Several bunkers owned by the butan royal

122
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:59,020
army,
and they began to build a road.

123
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,723
However,
since Bhutan's protection has been in 

124
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:04,560
India,
Sam,

125
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:05,393
since the 19 forties,
Indian troops arrived on June the 16th 

126
00:07:08,191 --> 00:07:12,570
and blocked the roads construction so 
far a pretty typical border conflict.

127
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:18,440
However,
the tensions,

128
00:07:18,441 --> 00:07:19,274
they didn't dilute.
They actually increased as the 

129
00:07:21,861 --> 00:07:23,930
discussions between Beijing and New 
Delhi.

130
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:25,610
Oh,
they became quite tense.

131
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:26,533
Chinese state media began to threaten 
the Indian government with serious 

132
00:07:29,091 --> 00:07:33,350
consequences.
China and India are dangerously close to

133
00:07:33,351 --> 00:07:36,710
military conflict in the Himalayas out 
at this point,

134
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:37,910
you might be wondering,
well,

135
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,744
why on earth was a land that is 
practically frozen for most of the year 

136
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:43,250
given such importance?
On the one hand,

137
00:07:43,251 --> 00:07:47,300
it seems that Xi Jinping's governments 
wanted to test India and punish them for

138
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:48,163
well,
a bunch of things for that relationship 

139
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,054
with the Dalai Lama and with Tibet for 
that growing ties with Washington for 

140
00:07:52,551 --> 00:07:53,384
their relations with Pakistan and so on 
and so with regard to India because 

141
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,583
China's controlling this area with its 
military presence in new road would put 

142
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:01,484
China within a stone's throw of the 
Siliguri corridor and narrow strip of 

143
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:05,714
land is considered strategic because it 
connects seven of the states of 

144
00:08:08,391 --> 00:08:10,700
northeast India with the rest of the 
country.

145
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,410
This is something you'd see well on 
this.

146
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,850
It's above all.
Beyond the tactical issues,

147
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:23,210
there's another important reason.
The same reason why China wanted to test

148
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,580
India and you're going to see what I'm 
talking about in just a minute.

149
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:32,790
Practice that finally on August the 28th
after many threats and a lot of tension,

150
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:36,750
both sides agreed to withdraw their 
troops and return to the starting points

151
00:08:36,751 --> 00:08:39,660
of this entire political muscle.
Of course years ago,

152
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:42,480
both powers rivalry.
It wasn't as obvious as it is now,

153
00:08:42,481 --> 00:08:44,790
but of course let's not fool ourselves 
the doc cam,

154
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:46,440
so it's.
Well,

155
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:47,393
it's the least of it.
I'm not just saying this because of the 

156
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:49,734
more than 3000 kilometers of border that
have territorial disputes between China 

157
00:08:52,801 --> 00:08:57,801
and India that are many,
many more a national strategy given them

158
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,124
the possible emergence of India as a 
superpower at the Chinese governments 

159
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:11,490
have adopted a strategy and that's just 
around it and yeah,

160
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:13,350
it's pretty much exactly what it sounds 
like.

161
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:14,213
In recent years,
China has tightened its ties with 

162
00:09:15,751 --> 00:09:19,380
Pakistan in exchange for $60,
billion dollars in infrastructure,

163
00:09:19,410 --> 00:09:24,270
especially to connect both countries,
including a strategic board in China,

164
00:09:24,271 --> 00:09:26,460
will operate until at least the year 20.
Fifteen,

165
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:34,263
on the other hand is a Chinese 
government company has taken control of 

166
00:09:36,371 --> 00:09:37,204
Hambantota port in Sri Lanka,
a country with which Beijing is also 

167
00:09:40,061 --> 00:09:43,090
strengthening its political ties 
regarding Bangladesh.

168
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,490
China has become the most important arm 
supplier.

169
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,353
Last year they sold them to submarines 
and finally there's an a poll which is 

170
00:09:49,931 --> 00:09:50,764
greatly improved its relationship with 
China off to a political conflict in 

171
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:55,810
2015 with New Delhi.
Now,

172
00:09:55,811 --> 00:09:56,740
well let's have a look at it.

173
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:03,903
You see India is surrounded crisis.
It was simply nothing more than a move 

174
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,520
in a chess game and this is a chess game
in which China has the economic capacity

175
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:19,250
under the money to make friends very 
easily.

176
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,203
Of course,
the fact that China's military 

177
00:10:21,231 --> 00:10:24,080
superiority over India is overwhelming.
Well,

178
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,860
that's also very helpful.
So a question that might arise after all

179
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,850
of this is,
well,

180
00:10:28,851 --> 00:10:29,684
what's India's bet?
Or rather what's their realistic 

181
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:33,460
response as well?
That response,

182
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,294
it basically comes in three words and 
those three words aren't the United 

183
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,073
States.

184
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:40,790
Yeah,

185
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:41,623
you heard it in recent years,
relations between the United States and 

186
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:44,354
India have become pretty close seat 
between 2009 and 2016 bilateral trade 

187
00:10:49,011 --> 00:10:49,844
has doubled and the sale of military 
equipment from the United States to 

188
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:57,660
India has multiplied by 50 years.
In fact,

189
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:00,990
everything indicates that India is going
to replace that old mig.

190
00:11:00,991 --> 00:11:05,270
Twenty one with a mega contracts have 
newly manufactured f six teams,

191
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,500
200 of them,
and if this is confirmed,

192
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,920
Lockheed Martin's intention,
the manufacturer with pentagons approval

193
00:11:10,921 --> 00:11:13,500
of course,
is to transfer this plane's worldwide.

194
00:11:13,501 --> 00:11:14,334
Production from Texas to India are 
pretty unbeatable way to strengthen 

195
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:18,540
alliances,
don't you think?

196
00:11:21,420 --> 00:11:22,253
Well,
now we can better understand not only 

197
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:27,090
China and India's tense relationship,
but also for example,

198
00:11:27,091 --> 00:11:29,910
the US is new hard strategy towards 
Pakistan,

199
00:11:29,911 --> 00:11:32,880
which we discussed in our previous video
about Afghanistan

200
00:11:39,830 --> 00:11:40,220
as of course

201
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:41,053
all of this starts based on a premise 
that India will emulate the economic 

202
00:11:43,791 --> 00:11:47,030
success that China has achieved in 
recent decades.

203
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:47,893
Narendra Modi,
the popular Indian Prime Minister of 

204
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:52,550
whom we already talked about is leading 
many changes,

205
00:11:52,610 --> 00:11:53,443
but not as many as the country needs,
but that is a discussion we can be for 

206
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:57,964
another day and now we want to know,
do you think China will succeed in 

207
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:01,720
beating India?
