00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:09,013
Just before we get into the video today,
do you want to say that I recently 

2
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:12,800
started a new channel,
it's called biographics.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:13,663
We do long form,
20 minutes ish biographies of people 

4
00:00:16,221 --> 00:00:18,590
from history as well as the present day 
politicians,

5
00:00:18,591 --> 00:00:19,424
but a whole lot else.
Please check out the link in the 

6
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,750
striction below and if you'd like 
biographics please subscribe anyway.

7
00:00:23,780 --> 00:00:25,790
Well,
everybody has their eyes on North Korea,

8
00:00:25,870 --> 00:00:29,000
not their nuclear programs.
Still worries those in the White House.

9
00:00:29,060 --> 00:00:32,720
That is the nuclear program of the 
Islamic Republic of Iran.

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,930
This country has such a bad reputation 
that when we talk about it,

11
00:00:38,931 --> 00:00:39,764
it can feel like we're talking about one
of those places that only exists in the 

12
00:00:42,651 --> 00:00:45,410
movies,
one of those countries dominated by evil

13
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:48,110
leaders who dream of destroying the 
world.

14
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:48,973
Well,
that might actually be some truth to 

15
00:00:50,421 --> 00:00:51,254
this,
but definitely not as much as some 

16
00:00:52,971 --> 00:00:54,020
seemed thing.
In fact,

17
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,190
Iran is not the most religious.
It's not the most authoritarian and it's

18
00:00:58,191 --> 00:00:59,024
not even the most hostile place towards 
women in this part of the world because 

19
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:04,880
we have Saudi Arabia,
which is far,

20
00:01:04,881 --> 00:01:06,300
far worse.
Dev,

21
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:08,810
you have,
Iran is a country of contradictions,

22
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:12,200
a country whose government claims to 
work under a democratic system,

23
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,350
but at the same time everything is under
the control of one man.

24
00:01:15,380 --> 00:01:16,213
Yeah.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:19,510
That man would be allie harmony,
the supremes.

26
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,083
At first glance,
he isn't as scary as its predecessor 

27
00:01:28,581 --> 00:01:30,770
Ruhollah Khomeini,
who was scary.

28
00:01:30,771 --> 00:01:35,090
Just have look at the truth is how many 
econ stand anything modern for him?

29
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:35,943
Modality might as well have come from 
Satan himself except for nuclear 

30
00:01:39,381 --> 00:01:40,220
technology,
of course,

31
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,400
explains why in the past few years 
around has been famous for two things.

32
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,263
Number one,
being one of the country's alongside 

33
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,440
China,
where the most people are executed every

34
00:01:54,441 --> 00:01:58,460
year and number two,
wanting to build their own nuclear bomb.

35
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,473
However,
unlike what has happened with the North 

36
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,620
Korean crisis,
the US and Iran,

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,970
they did reach an agreement.

38
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:05,823
Yeah.

39
00:02:07,670 --> 00:02:08,503
In 2015,
President Obama led the joint 

40
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,293
comprehensive plan of action and 
agreements to prevent Iran from 

41
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:14,653
obtaining a nuclear bomb as an agreement
to this many of considered to be one of 

42
00:02:17,421 --> 00:02:20,450
the greatest achievements in all the 
foreign policy.

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,393
It's now more than 50 years since 
President Kennedy stood before the 

44
00:02:23,861 --> 00:02:27,910
American people and said,
let us never negotiate out of fear,

45
00:02:27,911 --> 00:02:30,070
but let us never fear to negotiate.

46
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,073
Although to Fab all signs seem to point 
to the conclusion that this agreement 

47
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:39,170
has not kept either party.
Saturday presidents of the United States

48
00:02:40,251 --> 00:02:41,084
now,
Donald Trump is pretty clear about his 

49
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:44,960
opinion on the deal ever since he was a 
candidate.

50
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:45,823
He has described it as the worst 
agreement ever negotiated during his 

51
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:51,380
campaign.
Trump has vowed on many,

52
00:02:51,381 --> 00:02:52,214
many occasions that his top priority 
would be to put an end to such a 

53
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:59,180
catastrophic agreements.
I've been doing deals for a long time,

54
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,310
been making lots

55
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:02,620
of wonderful deals,
great deals.

56
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:05,680
That's what I do.
Never ever,

57
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:06,993
ever in my life have I seen any 
transaction so incompetently negotiated 

58
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,480
as our deal with Iran.

59
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,393
And do you think that this was the 
typical campaign message that every 

60
00:03:18,741 --> 00:03:21,890
politician repeats over and over again,
but then soon forgets about?

61
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,630
Well,
once the election has finished,

62
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:28,280
in his first speech at the UN assembly,
trump repeated it loud and clear.

63
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,303
The Iran deal was one of the worst and 
most one sided transaction the United 

64
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:39,740
States has ever entered into.
Frankly that deal is an embarrassment to

65
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:44,760
the United States and I don't think 
you've heard the last of it.

66
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:45,803
Believe me,

67
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:47,350
they haven't done so.
Yes,

68
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,540
but it is true that both the president 
sands,

69
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:52,100
many other members of the Republican 
Party load,

70
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:54,860
yes,
absolutely low disagreements and they do

71
00:03:54,861 --> 00:03:56,900
so because among other things 
agreements,

72
00:03:56,901 --> 00:03:57,734
we're also signed with North Korea.
This is a good deal for the United 

73
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,623
States.
North Korea will freeze and then 

74
00:04:03,951 --> 00:04:08,480
dismantle its nuclear program.
South Korea and our other allies will be

75
00:04:08,481 --> 00:04:11,240
better protected and well,
these agreements,

76
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,260
they didn't work at all except for 
allowing [inaudible] to lay hands on the

77
00:04:15,261 --> 00:04:15,951
bomb.
Well,

78
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:19,730
now you might be wondering why exactly 
is it such a controversial agreements?

79
00:04:19,790 --> 00:04:21,410
Well,
we're going to look at that in a bit.

80
00:04:21,411 --> 00:04:22,244
Before we do.
Let's take a look at the context in 

81
00:04:24,171 --> 00:04:29,171
which it was signed.
Iran,

82
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:34,503
a budding superpower.
So during the Cold War it is said that 

83
00:04:38,681 --> 00:04:43,681
the Russians were so obsessed that they 
saw a Chinese man behind every tree.

84
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:47,860
Something similar might not actually be 
happening between it wrong and the USA,

85
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:51,483
since the Islamic revolution of command 
I in 1979 in Iran has become one of 

86
00:04:54,431 --> 00:04:59,080
Washington's worst enemies.
It is accused of being the first sponsor

87
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:01,870
of radical and anti American groups like
Hezbollah,

88
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,704
Hamas or the Taliban.
Not to mention their support of the 

89
00:05:05,021 --> 00:05:07,240
Syrian regime under the Shah,
Al Assad,

90
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:11,170
but there is more to this.
Washington knows very well that Iran,

91
00:05:11,260 --> 00:05:13,000
it's not just any country.

92
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:20,320
Iran is absolutely huge.
It's got $8,

93
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:21,163
million inhabitants and one of the 
greatest amounts of mineral wealth on 

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,313
and hey,
it's not just about oil and natural gas 

95
00:05:27,021 --> 00:05:27,854
here,
but it's also got other minerals like 

96
00:05:28,731 --> 00:05:29,660
copper,
iron,

97
00:05:29,661 --> 00:05:30,630
zinc,
uranium,

98
00:05:30,631 --> 00:05:31,630
silver,
etc.

99
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:39,493
Yes,
we do all know that oil and natural gas 

100
00:05:40,801 --> 00:05:41,634
spelled that particularly important and 
that is why I now want to ask you a 

101
00:05:45,091 --> 00:05:45,924
question.
What is the biggest fear of manY 

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,740
analysts in Washington?
Well,

103
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,603
that is the sum of Iraq and Iran.
So let me explain both countries and 

104
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:56,273
neighbors ever majority shia ruled and 
influence of tehran or baghdad has 

105
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:02,210
skyrocketed in the last few years.

106
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,743
Yes,

107
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:05,943
we add up the oil reserves of both 
countries for the amount is one of the 

108
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:11,140
largest in the world.
It's larger than Saudi Arabia.

109
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:12,033
It's larger than Venezuela,
so coordinated international politics 

110
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:15,724
between these two countries would result
in a superpower which is outside the 

111
00:06:19,061 --> 00:06:23,860
control of Washington with almost a 
hundred and 20 million people that's not

112
00:06:23,861 --> 00:06:26,140
mentioning all of those other natural 
resources.

113
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:29,770
This quite simply would be an incredible
amount of influence,

114
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:33,850
so then what would happen if Iran got a 
hold of a nuclear bomb?

115
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,990
Now,
on the one hand,

116
00:06:35,110 --> 00:06:35,943
it would certainly consolidate its role 
as an international suva power as well 

117
00:06:38,651 --> 00:06:41,350
as its influence over its allies like 
Iraq,

118
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,213
but on the other hand,
it would also trigger an arms race with 

119
00:06:44,261 --> 00:06:45,094
Saudi Arabia and the emirates countries 
that have already said they won't be 

120
00:06:48,191 --> 00:06:51,520
left behind.
If tiran managers to get a nuclear bomb.

121
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,450
The results of all this,
well,

122
00:06:54,451 --> 00:06:56,020
that's pretty obvious.
It's tension,

123
00:06:56,021 --> 00:06:58,780
it's risk of proliferation,
it's risk of nuclear disaster.

124
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:02,050
That's also a loss of american leverage 
in the area.

125
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:02,913
It goes without saying,
but seeing such radical governments in 

126
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:05,914
possession of such powerful weapons also
doesn't make anyone feel particularly 

127
00:07:09,101 --> 00:07:10,030
safe.
Well,

128
00:07:10,031 --> 00:07:13,950
that was the situation when the 
agreement was reached back in 2015,

129
00:07:18,510 --> 00:07:19,343
the deal

130
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,223
years.
The United States is trying to stop the 

131
00:07:24,471 --> 00:07:26,510
nuclear program with financial 
penalties,

132
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:30,440
but these were pretty useless.
Didn't they harm the economy in Iran?

133
00:07:30,441 --> 00:07:31,400
Well,
absolutely,

134
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:34,070
but they did nothing to stop their 
nuclear program.

135
00:07:37,730 --> 00:07:39,740
Finally,
on november the 14th of July,

136
00:07:39,741 --> 00:07:42,980
2015,
the nuclear deal was signed an agreement

137
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:43,843
with a clear target to prevent 
proliferation and make sure Iran only 

138
00:07:47,271 --> 00:07:50,360
uses nuclear technology for peaceful 
purposes.

139
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,250
However,
since then the deal,

140
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,113
it has suffered harsh attacks.
We're going to have a look at some of 

141
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:56,930
the reasons cited by critics of this 
agreement,

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,793
but first I think now is a good time to 
think about the circumstances under 

143
00:08:01,131 --> 00:08:01,964
which this agreement was signed and the 
first thing we need to note is that the 

144
00:08:04,491 --> 00:08:07,550
nuclear program in Iran is very,
very advanced.

145
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:14,820
AccordIng to us intelligence.
If the agreement was to be broken,

146
00:08:14,821 --> 00:08:19,320
Iran could develop its first nuclear 
bomb in a matter of months.

147
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:21,990
This is the way it is today,
2017,

148
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:22,883
and it was even true back in 2015 when 
the iranian program was working at it's 

149
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:27,623
fullest capacity.
That is why I want to take a moment to 

150
00:08:29,431 --> 00:08:31,500
think about three possible outcomes 
here,

151
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:35,010
more agreements or Iran with nuclear 
capability,

152
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:42,050
so stopping the nuclear program with 
military intervention.

153
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,160
It would not have been an easy task.
It would have resulted in many victims.

154
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:48,670
The costs for the us would have been 
prohibitive and the us.

155
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,533
We've had to keep a military 
intervention in the middle east for 

156
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:52,573
decades to compare.
It is estimated that this would be the 

157
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:56,004
Iraq war multiplied by five because I 
mean it's one thing to destroy 

158
00:09:00,270 --> 00:09:01,103
infrastructure and it's a very different
thing to eliminate the knowledge that a 

159
00:09:04,291 --> 00:09:05,124
country has to make nuclear bombs.
Obama kneW that the situation was 

160
00:09:08,491 --> 00:09:09,324
totally impossible.
What he wanted was to get away from the 

161
00:09:11,221 --> 00:09:15,270
middle east and not get into any more 
trouble in this region because it's been

162
00:09:15,271 --> 00:09:17,730
something of a chronic nightmare for the
United States.

163
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:23,370
Sure.
On the other hand is not doing anything.

164
00:09:23,371 --> 00:09:24,204
Would've meant that Iran,
we've gotten their new toy and as we 

165
00:09:26,161 --> 00:09:26,994
have seen,
it would have resulted in an arms race 

166
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,780
in the region,
which Washington didn't want either.

167
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:33,090
So an agreement,
it was the only option left.

168
00:09:33,091 --> 00:09:35,250
I mean,
we make a deal and everyone's happy,

169
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,560
right?
Just wait there for a second.

170
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:40,980
Because despite that many experts,
especially republicans,

171
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:43,410
don't even want to hear about this pact.

172
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:48,030
Bad deal.
Obama broke every rule of negotiation.

173
00:09:48,060 --> 00:09:51,120
We get an agreement,
a very questionable value.

174
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,150
If I am elected president on the very 
first day in office,

175
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:58,530
I Will rip to shreds this catastrophic 
iranian nuclear deal.

176
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:03,030
The iranians have been given a blank 
check basically by,

177
00:10:03,170 --> 00:10:05,640
uh,
by depressing the United States.

178
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:09,760
I think it will just warhawks determined
to impose their ideas by forced,

179
00:10:09,761 --> 00:10:12,040
well,
maybe there are some like that.

180
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:12,903
But the truth is,
they all say the points they say when 

181
00:10:14,921 --> 00:10:15,754
they arise,
that the u s already signed many 

182
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:18,004
agreements with North Korea and pyong 
yang never kept its weren't which is 

183
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:23,590
wide.
North korean is now in nuclear power.

184
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:24,453
They are convinced that Iran will do the
same and there is no better evidence 

185
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:30,370
than the fact that Iran has not stopped 
their ballistic missile program.

186
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:32,433
Iran is boosting its missile 
capabilities in order to increase the 

187
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:36,453
accuracy,
precision and range Iran will not stop 

188
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:41,470
its missile projects

189
00:10:41,620 --> 00:10:42,453
and this program,
what has being developed with North 

190
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:44,983
Korea and technology.
So it seems clear which way deal with 

191
00:10:47,321 --> 00:10:48,370
Iran will go.

192
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:49,303
We cannot let a murderous regime 
continue these destabilizing activities 

193
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:57,943
while building dangerous missiles and we
cannot abide by an agreement if it 

194
00:11:03,231 --> 00:11:08,231
provides cover for the eventual 
construction of a nuclear program.

195
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,300
The science,
since the bank does a limited duration,

196
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:15,240
Iran could still put itself in a 
position to get its arsenal.

197
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:18,990
The moment the deal is over and it could
be armed within a matter of months.

198
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,110
However,
as we have seen the alternatives,

199
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,013
they're really not any better is that 
Iran doesn't necessarily need to go the 

200
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:26,220
way of North Korea.

201
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,493
You're on

202
00:11:31,900 --> 00:11:33,040
benefits of the agreement.

203
00:11:34,830 --> 00:11:35,663
I'm pretty sure many of you are thinking
that comparing North Korea and Iran is 

204
00:11:38,311 --> 00:11:39,144
easy after all,
both countries are radical 

205
00:11:40,801 --> 00:11:42,060
dictatorships,
right?

206
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,920
Well,
I mean not really to be.

207
00:11:43,921 --> 00:11:48,390
Third things that quite a bit different.
Iranian society is much more open minded

208
00:11:48,391 --> 00:11:49,224
than north korean society.
In Iran there is a well formed middle 

209
00:11:51,501 --> 00:11:52,334
class.
There are political debates and things 

210
00:11:53,531 --> 00:11:55,750
like having a smartphone and access to 
the internet.

211
00:11:55,810 --> 00:11:57,490
It's really quite common.
In fact,

212
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,220
most Iranians,
especially the younger generation,

213
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,410
clearly pro agreements,
you see,

214
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:04,870
it's not just a matter of international 
politics,

215
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:05,733
it's also a matter of quantity of life.
The penalties is put in place by the 

216
00:12:09,251 --> 00:12:10,084
international community.
They were very damagIng for her in 2013 

217
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,043
when presidents ahmadinejad the main 
defender of the agreements left power 

218
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:22,930
the economy of Iran.
It waS devastated.

219
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:26,120
For an investment vanished.
The unemployment rate skyrocketed.

220
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:30,250
Inflation grew to around 40 percent and 
the expectations for improvements,

221
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:31,930
it's high.
In short,

222
00:12:32,140 --> 00:12:32,973
it was a complete mess,
but thanks to the agreement that 

223
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:38,620
penalties started to disappear and since
then aisle exports of triples.

224
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,513
I mean Iraq is not North Korea.
They need the trade on the economic 

225
00:12:42,641 --> 00:12:44,310
advantages that disagreement is.

226
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:45,373
Yeah.

227
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:51,270
Joint comprehensive plan of action will 
produce the comprehensive lifting of all

228
00:12:51,271 --> 00:12:52,104
un security council sanctions as well as
multilateral and national sanctions 

229
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:57,323
related to iran's nuclear program,
including steps on access in areas of 

230
00:13:01,471 --> 00:13:03,180
trade,
technology,

231
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,920
finance,
and energy.

232
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,003
The hope for obama's administration was 
that with a more prosperous and trade 

233
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:10,000
open Iran,
the younger,

234
00:13:10,001 --> 00:13:13,660
more openminded generation would be 
allowed to take power in a few years.

235
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:14,523
However,
those who opposed the agreements argue 

236
00:13:16,011 --> 00:13:16,844
it's necessary to be more demanding with
roland because otherwise it will 

237
00:13:19,341 --> 00:13:22,690
eventually become another North Korea,
a new nuclear power.

238
00:13:22,750 --> 00:13:23,583
Anyway,
it's not an easy situation is you can 

239
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:26,140
see,
but truth be told,

240
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,003
I think it would be a mistake to think 
that any pact is bad until proven 

241
00:13:30,461 --> 00:13:31,294
otherwise.
Having to run under pressure might be a 

242
00:13:32,771 --> 00:13:36,040
good strategy,
but let's be careful not to go too far,

243
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,480
but we could all lose.
Well,

244
00:13:37,510 --> 00:13:38,343
now it's your turn.
If you were the president of the United 

245
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:40,923
States,
what do you think you would do with 

246
00:13:41,861 --> 00:13:43,120
Iran,
which you make a deal,

247
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:47,710
but leave your answer in the comments
