1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,070
Yep.
He has got an image problem for years.

2
00:00:02,071 --> 00:00:02,904
This gigantic country,
the second most populated in all of 

3
00:00:05,041 --> 00:00:05,874
Africa with almost a hundred million 
inhabitants with a synonym for extreme 

4
00:00:09,181 --> 00:00:10,140
poverty,
hunger,

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,060
disease,
war in short,

6
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,090
true misery.
However,

7
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,400
in the new century,
everything began to change.

8
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,330
Even though Ethiopia is still a very 
poor country in the last decade,

9
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:26,640
it has become one of the fastest growing
economies,

10
00:00:26,641 --> 00:00:31,641
not only in Africa but in the world at 
the same time.

11
00:00:32,341 --> 00:00:33,174
It has grown very close to Beijing and 
has also become a close ally of the 

12
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:38,430
United States in the fight against 
terrorism.

13
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:41,040
Why half face single friendship if you 
can have both.

14
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:41,903
The fact is that we're probably 
witnessing nothing more or less because 

15
00:00:44,821 --> 00:00:45,654
I'm the birth of a future African power 
and that's more than enough reason to 

16
00:00:51,991 --> 00:00:55,680
ensure that we hear on visual politic 
don't want to miss what's happening in a

17
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:59,550
country that many are already calling 
the new African China.

18
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:04,580
So listen up after decades of tension,
hostility and confrontation before ends,

19
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:13,884
after Eritrea gained independence from 
Ethiopia in 1993 on July the ninth of 

20
00:01:17,731 --> 00:01:18,564
2018 both countries signed a declaration
for peace and we should remember that 

21
00:01:28,671 --> 00:01:31,850
during this long confrontation,
they were tragic moments.

22
00:01:31,851 --> 00:01:32,684
Indeed,
the military conflicts between 98 and 

23
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:37,070
2000 kills nearly a hundred thousand 
people.

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,450
Now,
the leaders of both countries,

25
00:01:38,451 --> 00:01:40,620
they've agreed to sign for complete 
peace.

26
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,900
We had agreed to resume the services of 
our airlines to get our ports working,

27
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,230
to get our people to trade and to open 
our embassies again.

28
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:50,123
There is no longer a border between 
Eritrea and Ethiopia because of bridge 

29
00:01:53,191 --> 00:01:57,360
of love has destroyed it.
I be on that Ethiopia's prime minister,

30
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,313
but of course the question remains what 
has led these two countries to suddenly 

31
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,570
like each other so much?
Well,

32
00:02:03,571 --> 00:02:05,820
my friends,
even though it may seem incredible,

33
00:02:05,821 --> 00:02:09,480
one of the problems that prevented 
reconciliation was this village that you

34
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:12,600
see on the screen now.
It's bothering me and it's a place where

35
00:02:12,601 --> 00:02:13,434
there's practically nothing at all.
And do you see based on the peace 

36
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:24,210
agreements that were negotiated in our g
as in the year 2000 to ends,

37
00:02:24,211 --> 00:02:27,060
the last war,
this territory belongs to Eritrea.

38
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:28,163
In the end,
the Ethiopian government realize that 

39
00:02:29,821 --> 00:02:30,654
this didn't work for them,
so those peace agreements didn't really 

40
00:02:32,611 --> 00:02:36,930
go anywhere until the now,
now Ethiopia,

41
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,000
the stronger country between the two,
after all,

42
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:39,834
we're talking about a hundred million 
people against just over 5 million 

43
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,073
they've decided to give up because if 
you are on many occasions persisting 

44
00:02:48,581 --> 00:02:52,240
just to look stronger is a mistake.
That's bad for everyone.

45
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,103
There's nothing to gain and there's a 
great deal to lose in any case of this 

46
00:02:55,931 --> 00:02:59,520
piece is a good reflection of the 
changes that are taking place and is not

47
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,840
because this might surprise you.

48
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:03,973
Okay.

49
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,860
Chinese model,
recent years,

50
00:03:13,861 --> 00:03:17,490
Ethiopia has the calm one of the fastest
growing economies on the planet.

51
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,313
During the last decade,
Ethiopia has averaged a growth rate of 

52
00:03:24,691 --> 00:03:26,850
around 10% per year.
For example,

53
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:31,880
check out the following graphic here.
We can compare Ethiopia's GDP growth per

54
00:03:33,731 --> 00:03:36,820
capita with that of another rapidly 
growing country,

55
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:37,683
Vietnam and watch our,
because Ethiopia's population is huge 

56
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:42,880
and as we're talking here about GDP per 
capita,

57
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:43,743
but the hold on a moment,
we're not just talking about the 

58
00:03:45,251 --> 00:03:46,540
economy.
As you can imagine,

59
00:03:46,541 --> 00:03:50,170
all of this growth has led to some 
important social consequences,

60
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:54,070
which is something that sooner or later 
always happens when a country grows,

61
00:03:54,071 --> 00:03:56,080
opens up to the world and does things 
right.

62
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:04,360
Since the year 2000 the average life 
expectancy has increased by 13 years,

63
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,194
the number of workers with at least a 
completed secondary education has grown 

64
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:10,720
by almost 50% it's poverty.
Well,

65
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:12,130
look at what's happening with poverty.

66
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:20,250
Yup.

67
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:24,120
I know even today there is a lot of 
poverty in Ethiopia with a simple google

68
00:04:24,121 --> 00:04:24,954
search.
We can find terrible situations in this 

69
00:04:26,311 --> 00:04:27,390
country,
but folks,

70
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:28,253
let's be clear.
Overcoming poverty isn't something that 

71
00:04:30,361 --> 00:04:31,500
happens overnight.
I mean,

72
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:33,250
I wish it was that easy,
but it's not.

73
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:36,443
In any case,
how does ABB above that country's 

74
00:04:37,471 --> 00:04:41,340
capital is a good reflection of the 
process that Ethiopia is experiencing?

75
00:04:41,341 --> 00:04:45,510
Cranes works and projects of all kinds 
are absolutely flooding the city.

76
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:46,373
In fact,
it was here in this city that their 

77
00:04:47,701 --> 00:04:52,020
first light subway in sub Saharan Africa
was inaugurated in 2015 yeah.

78
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:56,780
Course.
Having reached this point,

79
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,760
the question that we must ask is,
well,

80
00:04:58,790 --> 00:05:02,600
how on earth has Ethiopia achieved such 
an economic leap?

81
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,493
What we can say that this country has 
become something like Beijing's 

82
00:05:05,211 --> 00:05:09,410
outstanding.
Okay,

83
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,273
great.
There's largely been led by essentially 

84
00:05:11,231 --> 00:05:13,030
copying the Asian giants.
See,

85
00:05:13,031 --> 00:05:13,864
on the one hand,
the Ethiopian government has promoted 

86
00:05:15,581 --> 00:05:16,414
the construction of enormous 
infrastructure projects that are 

87
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:23,460
essential for the country's development.
We're speaking,

88
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:25,690
for example,
all of a railway line,

89
00:05:25,691 --> 00:05:26,524
the cost more than $4 billion in 
connected Santa's Salbaba with the 

90
00:05:29,291 --> 00:05:30,124
Djibouti port to facilitate and 
merchandise exports or the greatest 

91
00:05:32,771 --> 00:05:36,030
projects in all of Africa.
The Grand Ethiopian renascence.

92
00:05:36,031 --> 00:05:36,864
Damn.
This is a John Dam on the Nile River 

93
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:38,944
that requires an investment of around $6
billion and his mission with soup 

94
00:05:41,521 --> 00:05:42,354
revolutionize the country's energy 
system with abundance and cheap 

95
00:05:44,951 --> 00:05:45,784
electricity.

96
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:50,363
By the way,
do you know who gave the investment and 

97
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:53,460
the knowledge for these projects?
Well.

98
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:54,323
Tony,
those of you who followed this channel 

99
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,920
regularly won't be surprised.
To a large extent.

100
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,840
It was China and Chinese company.
In fact,

101
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:03,723
China has become,
Ethiopia hasn't biggest investor and 

102
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,010
trading partner.
In other words,

103
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:10,850
a large part of the country's growth has
been due to its ties with China.

104
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:14,470
The second pillar of Ethiopia's growth 
is that little by Netapp,

105
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:15,313
large state owned companies began to 
operate with more autonomy and managed 

106
00:06:18,110 --> 00:06:20,480
to themselves almost as if they were 
private companies.

107
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:32,540
This is the case for example of 
Ethiopian Airlines,

108
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:33,374
the country's flagship carrier,
which has become the largest African 

109
00:06:35,871 --> 00:06:36,704
airline and it's now in,
tends to compete internationally with 

110
00:06:38,571 --> 00:06:39,404
the Nigga style lines in the industry.
Even though Ethiopian Airlines is a 

111
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:52,290
hundred percent state owned,
it's run like a business.

112
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,740
The board runs it as if it's British 
Airways or United Airlines,

113
00:06:55,770 --> 00:06:56,700
Zuma,
denon nuggets,

114
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:00,060
chairman of Fairfax,
Africa Fund Llc,

115
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,073
and finally the third pillar thi 
attraction of foreign direct investment 

116
00:07:04,201 --> 00:07:06,330
through the development of economic 
zones,

117
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:08,640
fiscal incentives,
participative financing,

118
00:07:08,670 --> 00:07:09,503
et cetera.
Take a look at how foreign investments 

119
00:07:11,161 --> 00:07:11,994
have evolved.
This is how Ethiopia has begun to 

120
00:07:19,571 --> 00:07:21,910
industrialize largely because of these 
policies,

121
00:07:21,911 --> 00:07:22,744
and also thanks to the cost of labor and
industry that has grown a lot in recent 

122
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:29,700
years has been textiles.
In fact,

123
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:30,603
brands such as h and m guest,
Tommy Hilfiger and Calvin Klein already 

124
00:07:33,251 --> 00:07:35,440
produced some of that governments in 
this country,

125
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:36,303
but unfortunately that's not all that 
similarities with China aren't limited 

126
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:40,100
to the economic part.

127
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,993
Okay.

128
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,550
At the same time that the country was 
experiencing an economic takeoff,

129
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:48,510
does that repression of civil liberties 
became stronger and stronger.

130
00:07:48,570 --> 00:07:50,210
The media,
it was broadly restricted.

131
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:52,680
Political opposition was persecuted 
websites,

132
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:54,150
blogs,
et cetera.

133
00:07:56,010 --> 00:07:56,843
In recent years,
this country became one of the 10 

134
00:07:58,020 --> 00:07:59,700
biggest journalist,
jailers,

135
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,860
and the entire wealth.
Ethiopian government virtually locks up,

136
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:06,630
forced into exile or intimidated almost 
every independent journalist.

137
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:09,330
In other words,
Ethiopia practically reached a situation

138
00:08:09,331 --> 00:08:12,450
in which there were no journalists,
only government spokesman,

139
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:15,300
but folks,
hold on a moment because now suddenly it

140
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:17,550
looks like everything has the gun to 
change.

141
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,443
Listen Up.
A new generation beginning of 2018 

142
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:35,290
Ethiopia was mired in a way of a 
violence,

143
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:36,124
racial clashes and political repression 
that was threatening the country 

144
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,540
stability with absolute collapse.

145
00:08:41,570 --> 00:08:42,020
Okay.

146
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,380
And although economically things have 
worked out quite well in recent years,

147
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,243
there have been some imbalances are 
rather large foreign debt and great 

148
00:08:50,281 --> 00:08:51,114
shortage of foreign currency.
As a result of large investments in 

149
00:08:53,191 --> 00:08:56,160
population growth and very high,
you found employment rates.

150
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,193
Indeed,
many were wondering if what if eop or 

151
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:02,610
had gone through in recent years have 
been nothing but a mirage.

152
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,780
However,
against all odds,

153
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,614
after a high power struggle,
the ruling Party v Ethiopian People's 

154
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:09,361
Revolutionary Democratic Front in 
practice,

155
00:09:09,361 --> 00:09:12,570
the only party elected Prime Minister 
Abe Akhmed,

156
00:09:12,690 --> 00:09:15,840
a 42 year old former army officer.
Not much was expected,

157
00:09:15,841 --> 00:09:18,000
but within just a few months,
boom.

158
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,890
Things have changed.

159
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,733
You see you since he came to power.
Akhmed has released many political 

160
00:09:25,751 --> 00:09:26,584
prisoners.
He has apologized for the government 

161
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,673
abuses.
He's announced senior officials of the 

162
00:09:30,341 --> 00:09:31,174
intelligence services and the security 
forces for having committed state at 

163
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:34,654
terrorism.
He's promoted the peace agreement with 

164
00:09:35,951 --> 00:09:36,784
Eritrea.
He's announced her modifications to the 

165
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:39,304
constitution to establish the limitation
of mandate and he's begun to dismantle 

166
00:09:42,251 --> 00:09:43,084
the political censorship and asked xcel 
journalists to return to the country 

167
00:09:47,350 --> 00:09:51,550
Ethiopia unblocks 264 websites and TV 
channels,

168
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,443
and not only that,
he has also announced that the 

169
00:09:53,591 --> 00:09:56,680
government will deepen the 
liberalization of the economy to attract

170
00:09:56,681 --> 00:09:57,514
more investments to the country if 
you'll be open this door to the world 

171
00:10:00,821 --> 00:10:03,880
with unprecedented privatization plan.
Of course,

172
00:10:03,881 --> 00:10:04,714
as you can imagine,
all of these things haven't been great 

173
00:10:06,521 --> 00:10:08,620
for the country's elite since their 
answer.

174
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:12,340
It didn't take long to come.
If you'll be in pm escapes,

175
00:10:12,341 --> 00:10:13,174
grenade attack,
one dead scores hurt on June the 23rd 

176
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:16,623
2018 during a political events in the 
heart of Addis Ababa in which the 

177
00:10:19,691 --> 00:10:21,790
president wore a Nelson Mandela tee 
shirts.

178
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:24,790
Some trying to put an end to his 
political transition.

179
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,653
However they failed and now the prime 
minister knows that he has to step on 

180
00:10:28,151 --> 00:10:28,984
the accelerator.

181
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:32,960
Yeah,

182
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:33,793
Ethiopia dear is,
it's still a very poor country that has 

183
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:37,670
many problems,
political,

184
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,290
social and economic.
However,

185
00:10:39,291 --> 00:10:40,800
the country,
not long ago,

186
00:10:40,801 --> 00:10:43,010
it was considered the most miserable 
country on earth.

187
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:45,200
Now seems to have an opportunity to take
off.

188
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:48,620
So will it do so well any time you can 
answer this question.

189
00:10:48,650 --> 00:10:49,483
And of course at visual politic,
