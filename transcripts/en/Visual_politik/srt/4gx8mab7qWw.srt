1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,900
How can the country overcome a crisis?
How can it reinvents itself,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:04,763
change itself and transform.
These are two of the questions you have 

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:11,180
asked us in the comments section here on
visual politic as well as a viewer.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:15,570
I think we can say that the economy 
usually evolves three cycles.

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,433
That is a growth phase is sooner or 
laser always followed by a crisis and 

6
00:00:19,801 --> 00:00:24,801
then this crisis is followed again by a 
new growth phase and so on and so

7
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,053
both.

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:31,600
For example,
since World War Two,

9
00:00:31,601 --> 00:00:35,050
the United States has undergone 11 
complete economic cycles.

10
00:00:35,051 --> 00:00:37,690
That is both growth and crisis years.

11
00:00:39,020 --> 00:00:39,540
Okay.

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,670
How has my friends things on always have
that simple?

13
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,640
Sometimes leaving a crisis is very,
very hard.

14
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:46,474
So much so that decades could go by so 
much so that even a rich and prosperous 

15
00:00:51,161 --> 00:00:51,994
country can stop being a rich and 
prosperous country because don't think 

16
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:58,780
that this only effects emerging 
countries,

17
00:00:58,990 --> 00:00:59,823
not at all.
The richest countries can suffer this 

18
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:05,144
type of deep crisis,
usually due to political reasons or 

19
00:01:08,421 --> 00:01:09,254
rather bad policies,
but he has to view our country can't 

20
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,780
even escape these deepest of crises or 
his hair on visual politic with,

21
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:21,250
for example,
the case of New Zealand's,

22
00:01:21,251 --> 00:01:23,740
which after undergoing a very harsh 
crisis,

23
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:26,220
managed to completely overturn the 
situation.

24
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:30,150
Well,

25
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:30,983
in this video we're going to show you 
another example and that would be the 

26
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:35,580
example of Canada.
Yep.

27
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:36,473
You heard me right?
Did you know that Canada almost went 

28
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:39,660
bankrupt?
Well,

29
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:40,523
if you didn't listen up Canada is one of
the richest freest and most prosperous 

30
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:55,870
countries with the highest quality of 
life on the planet.

31
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,020
It doesn't even matter what ranking we 
use.

32
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:01,854
It can be the United Nations Hdi,
the corruption perception index of 

33
00:02:04,501 --> 00:02:08,370
Transparency International,
the Fraser Institute,

34
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,203
Human Freedom Index,
or the legatum prosperity index in all 

35
00:02:11,731 --> 00:02:12,564
of them.
Canada is always among the highest on 

36
00:02:15,271 --> 00:02:17,010
the list,
but this video isn't about rankings,

37
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:17,844
but before we move on,
I just do want to touch on one last one 

38
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:20,904
very quickly.
See in the latest ranking of the best 

39
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:24,894
countries prepared to buy us news 
magazine and the Wharton School Canada 

40
00:02:27,661 --> 00:02:31,500
appears as the second best country to 
live in in the world.

41
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,750
Pretty clear as we already saw it on 
this channel,

42
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:40,160
that Canada,
dear viewer,

43
00:02:40,190 --> 00:02:42,920
is very,
very popular right now.

44
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:46,670
How are the things in Canada once always
this happy?

45
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:51,380
There was a time in the 1960s and 
especially in the 1970s where everything

46
00:02:51,410 --> 00:02:56,410
was about to collapse.
Disaster.

47
00:03:05,770 --> 00:03:06,680
Yes.
Can I do?

48
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,880
It was very similar to the United 
States.

49
00:03:08,881 --> 00:03:13,881
It was practically it's twin brother.
It had a very small governments.

50
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:17,670
The country was very decentralized and 
taxes were very similar.

51
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:18,563
Of course,
the idea then was to compete to attract 

52
00:03:20,101 --> 00:03:22,590
investments and thus also people from 
abroad,

53
00:03:22,830 --> 00:03:24,900
immigrants.
However,

54
00:03:24,901 --> 00:03:28,050
this all changed in the 1960s at that 
time,

55
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:28,884
Canada sought to distance itself from 
the United States and to try a new 

56
00:03:32,221 --> 00:03:33,054
political and economic model.
The great architects of this revolution 

57
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,040
was Pierre Trudeau.
Yup.

58
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:40,080
That's the father of the current prime 
minister,

59
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:40,914
Justin Trudeau.

60
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,850
We can forever spend more than we 
obtained from tax.

61
00:03:53,090 --> 00:03:56,540
Of course father and sons.
Politics aren't by no means the same.

62
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:59,150
It looks like just trudeau sets and he 
did his homework,

63
00:03:59,151 --> 00:04:01,700
but let's not straight from the subject 
too much.

64
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,493
The fact is that just introduce father 
govern Canada virtually uninterrupted 

65
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:15,741
between 1968 in 1984 and the fact is 
that throughout the 16 years in power,

66
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,750
the country changed a great deal.
Today I've seen you out once.

67
00:04:20,751 --> 00:04:22,980
You do implement a new political model 
in Canada,

68
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:23,843
which was a bit difference from 
Washington's capitalism and somewhat 

69
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,414
closer to Sylvia Moscow's collectivism 
as against the invisible hand of Adam 

70
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:33,443
Smith,
there has to be a visible hand of 

71
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,094
politicians whose objective it is to 
have the kind of society that is caring 

72
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:40,890
and humane.
Pierre Trudeau in facts in international

73
00:04:40,891 --> 00:04:42,810
politics.
One of the things the prime minister was

74
00:04:42,811 --> 00:04:46,380
best known for was his close friendship 
with Fidel Castro.

75
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,033
In any case,
the truth is that we could say that 

76
00:04:51,871 --> 00:04:56,700
Trudeau's father went a bit far,
he raised taxes a lot.

77
00:04:56,701 --> 00:04:59,640
He increased public spending,
he nationalized companies.

78
00:04:59,670 --> 00:05:00,503
And because he thought that all 
international trade and investment was 

79
00:05:03,001 --> 00:05:06,570
bad due to competition,
he decided to set up barriers.

80
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:11,490
So speaking of barriers,
well who does that sound like?

81
00:05:11,770 --> 00:05:12,603
President trump slap new tariffs on 
imported washing machines and solar 

82
00:05:16,171 --> 00:05:17,610
panels.
If that wasn't enough,

83
00:05:17,611 --> 00:05:18,444
he also made the central bank prints 
banknotes despair to expand credit and 

84
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,760
finance the government.
And well,

85
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:26,850
maybe this recipe is starting to sound a
bit familiar to you.

86
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:27,723
Well,
Venezuela's adding more zeroes to its 

87
00:05:28,951 --> 00:05:29,784
currency,
it releasing bills with larger 

88
00:05:31,051 --> 00:05:36,051
denominations.
Well,

89
00:05:36,810 --> 00:05:38,620
the results of all of this,
Divya,

90
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,800
is that within a few years,
the deficits,

91
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:41,693
unemployment,
and inflation rates to put the whole 

92
00:05:43,261 --> 00:05:47,640
country up against the ropes.
So of course when in 1984 Pierre Trudeau

93
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,474
left office,
he did see with the lowest popularity 

94
00:05:50,641 --> 00:05:53,850
level for a Canadian prime minister in 
decades,

95
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:57,000
only two out of every 10 Canadians still
supported him.

96
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:00,740
And it was at this time that Canadian 
citizens have to make a really important

97
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:05,741
decision.
The chain in the September,

98
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:14,493
1984 elections,
the conservatives won an overwhelming 

99
00:06:16,361 --> 00:06:17,194
victory.
It was clear that the country could not 

100
00:06:18,611 --> 00:06:21,430
continue along Trudeau's path.
The new prime minister,

101
00:06:21,431 --> 00:06:22,264
Brian Mulroney,
decided to reverse the situation and 

102
00:06:24,521 --> 00:06:27,070
began to strengthen ties with President 
Ronald Reagan.

103
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:31,870
A new era had begun over the next 10 
years.

104
00:06:31,871 --> 00:06:35,920
The conservative government did many 
things to improve Canada's economy.

105
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,570
For example,
lower taxes negotiated NAFTA,

106
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,300
the North American free trade agreements
that Unites Canada,

107
00:06:43,301 --> 00:06:44,134
the u s and Mexico,
and following in Margaret Thatcher's 

108
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,624
footsteps,
they launched an ambitious plan to 

109
00:06:48,281 --> 00:06:52,480
privatize large public companies such as
Air Canada and its Petro Canada.

110
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:54,230
Okay.

111
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,670
However,
he didn't do one thing,

112
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:57,890
the most difficult and some popular 
action,

113
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:00,710
and that was controlling public 
spending.

114
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,220
In 1990 the state held more than half of
the economy taxes.

115
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,113
We're still very high and there was a 
huge public deficits and further public 

116
00:07:08,421 --> 00:07:09,254
debt rose rapidly.
Conservatives had taken the easiest 

117
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:13,064
measures bus at the moment of truth.
They hadn't really shown much 

118
00:07:15,981 --> 00:07:16,940
commitments.
Therefore,

119
00:07:16,941 --> 00:07:20,660
in the following 1993 elections,
Piatra jury is leftist Liberal Party won

120
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:21,494
the elections again.
This time it promising a true 

121
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,830
revolution.
Could Pediatric Dose Party Save Canada

122
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:32,950
given it

123
00:07:33,340 --> 00:07:34,630
backgrounds?
You cons and I,

124
00:07:34,631 --> 00:07:37,480
this would have been very difficult to 
imagine.

125
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:38,410
That's,
well,

126
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:40,600
everything was really different at this 
time.

127
00:07:40,660 --> 00:07:41,493
The new governments wanted to completely
change the country's model once and for 

128
00:07:44,771 --> 00:07:45,604
all and no,
they no longer wanted anything to do 

129
00:07:47,711 --> 00:07:48,544
with Moscow or the Soviet model is.
The main idea was that quality of life 

130
00:07:51,250 --> 00:07:54,550
wasn't only related to the economy,
it was dependent on it.

131
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:56,800
If they wanted to achieve on a quality 
of life,

132
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,490
they needed to strengthen Canada's 
economy and that's essentially what they

133
00:08:00,491 --> 00:08:01,324
did,
especially under the minister of 

134
00:08:02,321 --> 00:08:03,880
Finance.
Paul Martin feet,

135
00:08:03,881 --> 00:08:07,280
true change promoter.
Well,

136
00:08:07,281 --> 00:08:08,750
the fact is that for the first few 
years,

137
00:08:08,751 --> 00:08:12,110
the leftist government launched a sharp 
public spending cuts,

138
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:15,380
eliminated many unnecessary programs and
adjusted spending.

139
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,170
For example,
these strongly reduced military spending

140
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,460
and many companies subsidy

141
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:22,243
just two years in real times,
spending drops by 15% under the 

142
00:08:25,911 --> 00:08:28,190
principle,
which states that the state shouldn't do

143
00:08:28,191 --> 00:08:29,024
things that companies can do better if 
the government decided to continue with 

144
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:32,774
the privatization plan in which they 
went as far as privatizing the railways 

145
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:37,034
and even the aviation management system.
Anne's no planes in Canada did not fall 

146
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:41,204
out of the sky and no,
there haven't been more accidents than 

147
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:44,570
they have been in other countries.
Indeed,

148
00:08:44,571 --> 00:08:45,404
on the contrary,
Canada's aviation management system is 

149
00:08:47,301 --> 00:08:51,890
considered one of the best in the world.
The fact is that in just four years,

150
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,753
the situation was under control.
The governments had gone from having a 

151
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,780
deficits to having a sub lists.
I mean,

152
00:08:57,810 --> 00:08:58,890
check out this graphic.

153
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,540
Of course,
as you can imagine,

154
00:09:05,541 --> 00:09:07,130
these measures,
they weren't easy.

155
00:09:07,131 --> 00:09:11,420
But one thing that seemed to be very 
clear to Canadians say much so if that's

156
00:09:11,421 --> 00:09:12,254
in the 1997 elections,
the liberal leftist party won again by 

157
00:09:15,471 --> 00:09:19,340
promising still more careful and 
government spending and on this occasion

158
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,293
fewer taxes as they said,
their role was to protect and give 

159
00:09:22,701 --> 00:09:23,534
opportunities to the most 
disenfranchised and not to waste 

160
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,850
everyone's money.
It all seems pretty sensible,

161
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,721
don't you think?
Well,

162
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:34,190
listen to Paul Martin's words in 2003 as
he reviewed that 10 years in power,

163
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:35,520
we have to build it.

164
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,280
21st century economy in Canada for 
Canadians.

165
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:39,143
We succeeded in the last 10 years 
because we did not deviate from our 

166
00:09:41,371 --> 00:09:42,870
course.
Balanced budgets,

167
00:09:43,020 --> 00:09:44,790
uh,
continually dropping debt ratio,

168
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:47,520
lower taxes.
We must stay on that course.

169
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,210
We must be a government committed to 
accountability of government that treats

170
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,060
taxpayers' money like it is your money,
Paul Martin.

171
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:58,590
This revolution was a real turning 
points in Canada's history.

172
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,720
[inaudible]

173
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,960
to the country experienced in the 1980s 
and especially in the 90s,

174
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:16,140
allowed for this country's situation to 
change completely.

175
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,003
Canada went from being considered an 
honorary member of the Third World by 

176
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:20,784
the Wall Street Journal due to its 
public debt problems to becoming the 

177
00:10:23,551 --> 00:10:24,384
most fashionable country in the world.
We'll potsy howdens only solve the 

178
00:10:31,941 --> 00:10:32,774
country's problems.
They had changed its model in the 

179
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:36,383
following years up until today,
all political options opt for the 

180
00:10:38,301 --> 00:10:39,680
Canadian model.
Mind you,

181
00:10:39,710 --> 00:10:40,543
Canada is no tax haven far from us 
because they have understood that 

182
00:10:43,341 --> 00:10:46,520
companies need to be cared for and is 
not punished.

183
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,010
Check this out.

184
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:47,843
Jobs

185
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:53,383
you had that rights.
If we take all taxes that companies pay 

186
00:10:55,341 --> 00:10:56,174
into accounts,
this country situation is actually very 

187
00:10:58,131 --> 00:10:59,480
advantageous.
In fact,

188
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:00,314
Canada is one of the few developed 
countries that has been decreasing as 

189
00:11:02,571 --> 00:11:03,404
taxes for almost 20 years to make the 
country more competitive and consider 

190
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:07,643
for example,
how company taxes have evolved and this 

191
00:11:15,271 --> 00:11:16,104
policy has mostly favored.
The weakest salaries have grown a lot 

192
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:19,733
and this is one of the countries that 
receives the most immigrants and 

193
00:11:21,991 --> 00:11:25,990
employment rates are very high.
In addition,

194
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:28,000
if all of this weren't enough in recent 
years,

195
00:11:28,001 --> 00:11:28,834
Canada has also become a world civil 
liberties champion as we saw her a 

196
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:33,940
visual policy in a previous video.

197
00:11:35,590 --> 00:11:39,610
And this Divya is how Canada managed to 
escape its greatest crisis.

198
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,473
And by the way,
just as it happened in New Zealand and 

199
00:11:42,191 --> 00:11:43,024
Australia,
these reforms were carried out by 

200
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:47,560
leftist parties.
But this isn't about left or right.

201
00:11:47,561 --> 00:11:52,420
It's about understanding that a strong 
competitive and globally open economy is

202
00:11:52,421 --> 00:11:55,420
the best to improve everyone's quality 
of life.

203
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:57,130
But having said that,
now it's your turn.

204
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:59,500
Do you think Canada is a good role 
model?

205
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,363
