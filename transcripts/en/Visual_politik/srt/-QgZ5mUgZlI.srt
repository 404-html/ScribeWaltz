1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
Congratulations.
Yes.

2
00:00:01,621 --> 00:00:02,580
Do you when?
Well,

3
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:05,520
to all of us,
dear view is a visual politic.

4
00:00:05,521 --> 00:00:10,521
It may have gone unnoticed,
but this is a historical events.

5
00:00:10,940 --> 00:00:14,160
This not for the first time in the 
entire history of humanity.

6
00:00:14,161 --> 00:00:17,070
We live in a world where poverty no 
longer effect.

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,410
Most of the population surprised

8
00:00:23,940 --> 00:00:24,430
well,

9
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,263
you shouldn't be here or visual politic.
We've already told you that this was 

10
00:00:27,791 --> 00:00:29,230
about to happen.
Folks today,

11
00:00:29,231 --> 00:00:30,064
let's forget all about the apocalyptic 
perspectives that we've covered for so 

12
00:00:34,390 --> 00:00:35,223
many years about the world we live in.
The truth is that today on our planet's 

13
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:38,793
most of the population either belongs to
the middle class or do the wealthiest 

14
00:00:41,741 --> 00:00:42,574
classes.

15
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,860
Yes.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,330
In other words,
as you can see,

17
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:52,331
poverty is now not such a looming issue 
that is still a lot of poverty,

18
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:53,684
but the truth is that we've never before
known a world where poverty didn't 

19
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:00,980
affect most of the population and don't 
tell me that that's not great news,

20
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:04,760
but just hold on a second because some 
of you might be asking some questions in

21
00:01:04,761 --> 00:01:06,530
your mind right now.
Like for example,

22
00:01:06,531 --> 00:01:08,270
well,
what on earth are you talking about,

23
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:10,100
Simon?
What do you mean exactly?

24
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:12,980
If that's the case,
why is everyone so pessimistic?

25
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,160
Or maybe you're even asking,
is all of this sustainable?

26
00:01:16,161 --> 00:01:19,340
Can the environments with the such a 
heavy burden?

27
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,233
Oh,
we have perhaps on the threshold of the 

28
00:01:21,861 --> 00:01:23,900
world's very destruction.
Well,

29
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:27,260
we're going to explore all of those 
questions in today's video.

30
00:01:27,261 --> 00:01:28,094
So that's up.
The general impression of most people 

31
00:01:40,480 --> 00:01:41,313
you can't deny it is that we live in a 
world full of misery of inequality or 

32
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:49,180
injustice and yes,
all of that does exist,

33
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,720
but fortunately it's becoming less 
frequent.

34
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:56,730
Just one area or with just one plane.
Monday,

35
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:00,970
a battery fire in an auxiliary power 
unit in the belly of the plane.

36
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:06,160
Right now it's rated as very unhealthy 
by the US embassy monitoring site.

37
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,173
Extraordinary snake of trash.
I mean literally it rolls around the 

38
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:13,220
hillside,
so yeah,

39
00:02:13,221 --> 00:02:16,220
every time you turn on the TV or your 
visit a news website,

40
00:02:16,221 --> 00:02:19,700
you'll find catastrophes of all sorts of
kinds.

41
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:20,613
Unfortunately,
we don't usually find much good news 

42
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:25,500
even though this is the kind that is 
generally much more

43
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:26,563
awesome.

44
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,073
You'll see,
according to the Brookings Institute in 

45
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:32,700
the world,
datalabs estimates,

46
00:02:32,701 --> 00:02:33,534
we hit an extraordinary milestone this 
past September of 2018 for the first 

47
00:02:37,831 --> 00:02:38,664
time in the history of mankind to most 
people who live in the world are no 

48
00:02:42,571 --> 00:02:44,910
longer poor.
We're talking about more than 50 percent

49
00:02:44,911 --> 00:02:45,744
of the world's population.
Approximately three point 8 billion 

50
00:02:47,791 --> 00:02:50,790
people who belong to a middle class or 
wealthy homes.

51
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:51,683
In fact,
this is the rough distribution of the 

52
00:02:53,221 --> 00:02:54,810
world's population today,
so

53
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,123
bounce.

54
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:03,980
Now,
some of you might be wondering,

55
00:03:03,981 --> 00:03:06,390
well,
what exactly do you mean by middle class

56
00:03:06,391 --> 00:03:09,050
time?
Well,

57
00:03:09,051 --> 00:03:11,660
fundamentally this is people with enough
purchasing power.

58
00:03:11,661 --> 00:03:12,494
Do you allow them to live comfortably?
That is they can buy washing machines 

59
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:16,664
and refrigerators,
they can go to restaurants and they can 

60
00:03:18,441 --> 00:03:19,274
go on vacation.
They can endure some unexpected 

61
00:03:21,231 --> 00:03:22,064
instability such as an illness or a 
period of unemployment without falling 

62
00:03:25,461 --> 00:03:26,180
back into

63
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,013
awesome.

64
00:03:29,060 --> 00:03:29,893
To be more specific for this particular 
studies offers the households that have 

65
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:37,810
a consumption capacity of more than $11 
per day per person that just did for the

66
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:39,970
price level are part of the middle 
class.

67
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:41,033
Yes.

68
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:46,620
That is not all the best is yet to come.
That allow me to explain.

69
00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:47,533
As you know,
there's still a lot of poverty in the 

70
00:03:48,501 --> 00:03:49,334
world.
No less than 650 million people live in 

71
00:03:51,351 --> 00:03:52,184
extreme poverty.
They aren't even guaranteed the most 

72
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:58,400
basic things like food and of course 650
million people is far too.

73
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,423
The good news is that changes are 
happening so quickly that in the next 

74
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:07,920
few decades this issue may have 
disappeared entirely,

75
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,300
so now you might be wondering,
well,

76
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,120
how fast are we really talking about 
here?

77
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,983
Well,
to give you an idea of how fast things 

78
00:04:14,191 --> 00:04:16,800
are changing,
check out these figures

79
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:22,890
in all wells for every second that 
passes,

80
00:04:22,891 --> 00:04:26,700
one person escapes extreme poverty every
single second.

81
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:30,630
It is exactly this lightening fast rate 
that has caused the population living in

82
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:35,631
conditions of extreme poverty to fall by
75 percent from 1990 to 2015,

83
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,200
but even with this news,
without a doubt,

84
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,034
what's most surprising is what's 
happening with the middle class in that 

85
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,960
same period of time that is every single
second,

86
00:04:45,961 --> 00:04:50,670
approximately five people leave poverty 
behind and join the middle class.

87
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,623
Five people per seconds.
That folks means that if this rate 

88
00:04:54,270 --> 00:04:56,730
continues in just 12 years,
by the year 20,

89
00:04:56,731 --> 00:04:57,950
30,
the middleclass,

90
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:01,140
who would make up the vast majority of 
the world's popular

91
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,910
good

92
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,720
use.
Wouldn't you agree?

93
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:12,683
The middle class would mean a world with
fewer poor people with a greater 

94
00:05:15,531 --> 00:05:19,220
commitment to academic studies and 
knowledge with a greater tendency to set

95
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:20,054
up companies and also a population 
that's more demanding towards 

96
00:05:22,701 --> 00:05:24,260
politicians.
Among other things.

97
00:05:24,261 --> 00:05:26,750
This is because the middle class is a 
proprietary class.

98
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,280
People in the middle of class,
they have houses,

99
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:29,114
they have savings businesses,
and that of course it leads them to be 

100
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,700
more committed to stability and to be 
more demanding.

101
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:41,640
Not only that,
as we've told you many times,

102
00:05:41,641 --> 00:05:42,474
this huge growth means another thing,
hundreds of thousands of opportunities 

103
00:05:46,111 --> 00:05:47,190
for enterprise.
Now,

104
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:48,024
hold on just a moment and here's the 
question that many of you may be asking 

105
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:51,444
yourselves and we know you're asking it 
because we see asking in the comments 

106
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:54,893
and that is,
can our weld support so many consuming 

107
00:05:58,250 --> 00:06:02,830
such a large amount of stuff?
Aren't we really sowing the seeds of our

108
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,580
destruction?
Well,

109
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:09,820
let's see a path to the abyss.
Climate Change,

110
00:06:17,471 --> 00:06:19,090
mass extinction,
water pollution.

111
00:06:19,091 --> 00:06:20,880
Folks,
I don't even have to say,

112
00:06:20,881 --> 00:06:23,170
uh,
we are facing many challenges.

113
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:25,510
In fact,
if we take a look at the news,

114
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,373
we could get the impression that we're 
heading full speed towards some sort of 

115
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,064
precipice and of course with so many 
people consuming more and more 

116
00:06:32,981 --> 00:06:35,500
resources,
it's normal for our lives to be pervaded

117
00:06:35,501 --> 00:06:37,690
by the question of what's going to 
happen to the planet.

118
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:45,390
But what if it wasn't exactly like that?
What if after a certain level,

119
00:06:45,391 --> 00:06:46,224
the relationship between the 
environments and wealth actually became 

120
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:49,831
positive?
Well,

121
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:50,664
folks,
that's the direction that things are 

122
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:53,220
actually moving.
See,

123
00:06:53,221 --> 00:06:54,054
when we talk about development and 
economic growth and consumption to 

124
00:06:56,881 --> 00:06:57,714
issues logically concern us a lot.
One is pollution and damage to the 

125
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:04,110
environment,
and the second is whether or not there's

126
00:07:04,111 --> 00:07:06,090
going to be enough resources for 
everyone.

127
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:06,983
So let's start with the first one first.
Is it possible that things aren't going 

128
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:13,020
to go down such a bad path?
Let's take a look.

129
00:07:13,021 --> 00:07:13,854
For example,
what happens in recent years in the 

130
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:18,300
largest economies on the planet,
so that is the United States,

131
00:07:18,301 --> 00:07:20,520
the European Union,
China and Japan.

132
00:07:25,540 --> 00:07:26,373
Yeah.

133
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,323
Nineteen,
63.

134
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:28,173
Nineteen states issued zero point nine,
four kilograms of co two for every 

135
00:07:31,221 --> 00:07:35,690
dollar of production in 2014.
This value was just point three four,

136
00:07:35,691 --> 00:07:36,524
which is 64 percent less for,
it's called the European Union reduced 

137
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:40,513
co two emissions per dollar of 
production by 54 percent between 1991 

138
00:07:43,761 --> 00:07:46,340
and 2014.
And the same is true of Japan,

139
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:47,203
even China or infamous China,
the country that used coal for 

140
00:07:50,390 --> 00:07:51,223
everything has reduced its relative co 
two emissions by 75 percent over the 

141
00:07:55,461 --> 00:07:56,294
past four decades.
That is to say technological 

142
00:07:58,251 --> 00:07:59,084
developments.
And New environments or concerns are 

143
00:08:00,801 --> 00:08:04,670
helping the world produce more policing.
Last,

144
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:09,870
yeah.

145
00:08:09,870 --> 00:08:10,703
You heard the absolutely right.
Improved technology and increasing 

146
00:08:13,471 --> 00:08:14,304
concern for the environments are 
managing to slow down and even reverse 

147
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:21,510
the damage to our planet's.
Take a look at the United States,

148
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:24,450
Dannon,
again,

149
00:08:24,540 --> 00:08:25,373
environmental improvements once deemed 
impossible have taken place since 1970 

150
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,640
when the environmental protection agency
was established.

151
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:36,540
United States has slashed.
It's a missions have five air pollutants

152
00:08:36,541 --> 00:08:38,630
by almost two thirds over the same 
period.

153
00:08:38,700 --> 00:08:39,533
The population grew by more than 40 
percent and those people drove twice as 

154
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:45,690
many miles and became two and a half 
times Richard Steven pinker.

155
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,490
The truth,
folks is that it's becoming increasingly

156
00:08:48,491 --> 00:08:49,324
clear that the relationship between the 
environments and wealth has an inverted 

157
00:08:52,721 --> 00:08:53,554
u shape.
That is to say after a determined level 

158
00:08:56,041 --> 00:08:56,874
of wealth,
societies begin to worry more about the 

159
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,560
environments.
They begin to take measures to take care

160
00:09:01,561 --> 00:09:02,394
of it,
and they begin to develop and use clean 

161
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:05,303
technologies.
Renewable energies will dominate the 

162
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:08,994
future German electricity sector thanks 
to the impulse of offshore wind and 

163
00:09:12,871 --> 00:09:14,370
geothermal.
For example,

164
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,204
this is what the environmental 
performance index an index constructed 

165
00:09:18,001 --> 00:09:22,290
from metrics that measure the quality of
our water forest and natural inhabitants

166
00:09:22,291 --> 00:09:25,830
indicates out of the 180 countries that 
make up the index,

167
00:09:26,310 --> 00:09:29,640
but to have improved in the last decade.
On the other hand,

168
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,120
the index shows that the richer a 
country is on average,

169
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:37,590
the cleaner it's environments becomes.
There's more environmental awareness and

170
00:09:37,591 --> 00:09:39,830
so it gets better results.
Sure.

171
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,890
I mean,
if we think about it,

172
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:41,783
it's really quite logical.
Richer countries can allocate more 

173
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:44,724
resources towards technological 
developments and protecting natural 

174
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:48,600
areas.
In fact,

175
00:09:48,601 --> 00:09:49,434
since 1990,
as the world has become richer and 

176
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:53,460
richer,
protected areas have almost doubled.

177
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,443
Today,
more than 15 percent of the surface of 

178
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:58,470
the planet is protected,
and not only that,

179
00:09:58,530 --> 00:09:59,363
the forestation,
one of the great ecological threats is 

180
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:06,320
undergoing a clear decline deforestation
for the world's largest tropical forest.

181
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:12,200
The Amazon peaked in 1995 and from 2004 
to 2013,

182
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,180
the rate fell by four fifths.
Steven pinker,

183
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,073
when the laundry middle class will mean 
more resources to care for the 

184
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:19,044
environment,
more people developing cleaner 

185
00:10:20,131 --> 00:10:23,250
technologies and a greater level of 
environmental awareness.

186
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:24,150
Now,
don't get me wrong,

187
00:10:24,151 --> 00:10:24,984
there are many challenges ahead,
but the trend isn't nearly bad as often 

188
00:10:27,901 --> 00:10:28,734
portrayed,
but we don't really need to take our 

189
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,820
foot off the gas.
We do need to promote cleaner production

190
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:33,654
methods and technologies,
but we're not in an apocalyptic or 

191
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,310
irreversible situation.
Bands,

192
00:10:38,311 --> 00:10:40,140
of course,
the empirical evidence tells us that the

193
00:10:40,141 --> 00:10:40,974
best way to overcome these challenges is
with more investments ends with richer 

194
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:45,203
and better formed societies.
Regarding the second question as to 

195
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:53,110
whether natural resources will be 
exhausted on Austin,

196
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,953
I think we can rest assured that they 
won't be not so many because there are 

197
00:10:57,061 --> 00:10:58,830
many resources,
but above all,

198
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:01,980
because human activity aims to seek 
better ways of production,

199
00:11:02,010 --> 00:11:02,843
including recycling the development of 
new technologies that allow for the 

200
00:11:05,491 --> 00:11:08,550
exploitation of new resources for the 
managed to do more.

201
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,563
With

202
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,550
all of these reasons,
and don't worry,

203
00:11:13,551 --> 00:11:16,010
we're going to talk much more about this
topic in the future.

204
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:20,330
I think we have to be more than 
satisfied that for the first time in the

205
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,253
history of humanity,
our average condition isn't poverty or 

206
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:25,880
hunger.
Yes,

207
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:26,833
humanity is managing to defeat poverty,
and so I really hope you enjoyed that
