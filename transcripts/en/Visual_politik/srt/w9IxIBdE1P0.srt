1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,910
First is Spanish colony.
Then in American one Puerto Rico,

2
00:00:02,970 --> 00:00:03,803
a small islands in the Caribbean.
It defines itself as a free state 

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,073
associated with the United States 
Associated State who citizens have 

4
00:00:18,981 --> 00:00:21,950
American citizenship,
but unless they move to another state,

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,410
cannot vote in the presidential 
elections,

6
00:00:24,440 --> 00:00:26,810
and even though they have a 
representative in Congress,

7
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:28,400
he also lacks a vote.

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:29,780
Yeah,

9
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,700
well,
the major issues be they political,

10
00:00:31,701 --> 00:00:32,534
economic or military lions at the 
federal jurisdiction of the United 

11
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:36,831
States.
Lately,

12
00:00:36,831 --> 00:00:38,750
there's been a lot of talk about this 
territory.

13
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:39,584
Not only because in September of 2017 
they suffered the harsh impacts of 

14
00:00:42,921 --> 00:00:43,754
Hurricane Maria,
but also because a few months before in 

15
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,040
May of that same year,
Puerto Rico declared itself bankrupts.

16
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,540
After more than 10 years of economic 
crisis sweater,

17
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:54,020
Rico's public accounts could no longer 
keep going.

18
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,320
This is because the island's public 
dense deposit is $70 billion,

19
00:00:57,321 --> 00:01:01,060
ends another $50 billion in future 
payment commitments such as pensions,

20
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:01,894
Stevia,
we're talking about figures that are 

21
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:04,604
huge for an island.
The belly has more than 3 million 

22
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,990
inhabitants because of this.
In recent years,

23
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:13,070
Puerto Rico has become known source of 
as the grease of the Caribbean.

24
00:01:13,130 --> 00:01:15,410
The simple fact of the matter is,
dear viewer,

25
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:16,273
Puerto Rico is insolvent,
but how exactly did they get to this 

26
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:20,841
point?
Well,

27
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:21,674
listen up.

28
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:27,023
Okay,

29
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:31,103
let me,
that is a lot of discussion going on 

30
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:33,214
about how to solve Puerto Rico's serious
crisis and how to stop the exodus that 

31
00:01:36,731 --> 00:01:39,550
the island is suffering,
which we saw in a previous video,

32
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:41,350
but first of all,
to address this issue,

33
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:42,243
I think we need to answer a question and
that's of course what I'll know if it 

34
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:45,580
happens.
Yeah.

35
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:48,010
What caused pressure rico to become 
quite soon in Sylvan?

36
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:49,960
What led to it becoming such a broke 
island?

37
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,473
Well,
of course the grade culprit here is the 

38
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:01,334
Puerto Rican government itself.
The government that has been spending 

39
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,513
uncontrollably for decades and has many 
suspicions of corruption as an absolute 

40
00:02:08,751 --> 00:02:09,584
disdain for production.
The going beyond his Puerto Rico's 

41
00:02:14,901 --> 00:02:15,734
government.
Washington also holds a large amount of 

42
00:02:17,451 --> 00:02:22,451
responsibility for this whole mess.
Washington's responsibilities.

43
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:23,384
In fact,
so great that it wouldn't be 

44
00:02:23,931 --> 00:02:24,764
unreasonable to save that the federal 
government has been the main driver of 

45
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:29,840
Puerto Rico's bankruptcy.
Yep.

46
00:02:29,930 --> 00:02:30,763
You heard that right?
The United States says bombarded Puerto 

47
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,620
Rico with five policies whose results 
were absolutely devastating.

48
00:02:36,621 --> 00:02:39,440
Five policies concerning trade 
regulations,

49
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,140
salaries and welfare.
And if you don't believe me,

50
00:02:42,141 --> 00:02:43,070
yes.
Well,

51
00:02:43,071 --> 00:02:43,904
keep on listening.
It's free debt with this supposed 

52
00:02:55,090 --> 00:02:55,923
intention of aiding the Puerto Rican 
economy and helping it's government 

53
00:02:58,201 --> 00:03:01,720
access the capital markets at the dawn 
of the Jones Schaffrath Act,

54
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,643
Washington creators,
a triple municipal state and federal 

55
00:03:05,201 --> 00:03:08,020
exemption on Puerto Rico's debts 
interests.

56
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:08,883
Thus,
if any US citizen purchased Puerto 

57
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:11,553
Rico's public desk,
he or she was exempt from paying taxes 

58
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:15,130
on the interest that was received.

59
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,783
In other words,
if an American bought a dance from a 

60
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,214
company,
they had to pay taxes on the returns 

61
00:03:25,541 --> 00:03:28,360
that they obtained.
But if he or she invested in the debt of

62
00:03:28,361 --> 00:03:29,194
Puerto Rico's politicians,
he or she didn't have to pay any tax at 

63
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:33,184
all.
So you might imagine that with such 

64
00:03:34,331 --> 00:03:37,780
attractive conditions,
people would be queuing up to lend money

65
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,910
to the islands governments.
It was easy money.

66
00:03:39,911 --> 00:03:43,750
The local politicians didn't take long 
to spend and it was aimed at achieving a

67
00:03:43,751 --> 00:03:47,830
single objective and that was winning or
should they really say buying votes?

68
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:48,693
I mean,
what better scenario could we can cox 

69
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,004
for irresponsible politicians acts 
engineering still logic while the 

70
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,150
federal government's encouraged the 
island to get deeply indebted,

71
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:09,850
it also made things harder for the 
private economy.

72
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:14,470
In 2006 Congress abolish the so called 
section nine three six of the tax code,

73
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:18,310
a section that provided significant 
benefits for the companies that invested

74
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:19,144
in the islands.
And let's not forget here that Puerto 

75
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,140
Rico is the poorest territory in the 
United States.

76
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,310
Well,
the fact is that this incentive model,

77
00:04:28,311 --> 00:04:30,170
it was very,
very successful,

78
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,033
but years it helps Puerto Rico grow a 
loss even leading to it becoming a 

79
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,590
manufacturing and pharmaceutical 
powerhouse.

80
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,033
The ones,
the incentives were gone in 2006 two 

81
00:04:43,931 --> 00:04:46,650
years before the great international 
financial crisis,

82
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:47,493
Puerto Rico began to fall into the best 
overnight to the condition of the 

83
00:04:50,531 --> 00:04:53,800
companies that had been supporting.
Puerto Rico changed drastically,

84
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:57,490
forcing investments in the island to 
sync legal security.

85
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,593
And it was a bit of a joke,
but that's not even close to being all 

86
00:05:01,181 --> 00:05:06,181
hair merchant,
marine law,

87
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,433
maybe the most controversial points of 
all and at the same time it's the most 

88
00:05:16,261 --> 00:05:17,880
absurd law.
The Jones Act,

89
00:05:17,881 --> 00:05:20,880
which passed in 1920 and distill in 
force for bids,

90
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,290
foreign flag vessels from transporting 
goods between two United States ports.

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:26,153
Thus they ship loaded with containers 
coming from China cannot stop in Puerto 

92
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,450
Rico because it has to continue on to 
the mainland.

93
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:35,050
They're the container is destined for 
Puerto Rico are unloaded and then loaded

94
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:37,830
onto another ship.
This time with a US flag and crew,

95
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:38,693
which is obviously very expensive.
It's like what's the result of all of 

96
00:05:41,011 --> 00:05:42,020
this?
What Question Rico?

97
00:05:42,021 --> 00:05:45,750
It has the most expensive shipping costs
of all Caribbean countries.

98
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,440
It's something that not only industry 
but also he makes exports more expensive

99
00:05:49,441 --> 00:05:52,140
and reduces every prayer to wrekin's 
purchasing power.

100
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:56,490
In fact,
fax it

101
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,040
to get an idea of this loss

102
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,900
implications.
We should mention that evenly.

103
00:05:59,901 --> 00:06:00,734
Puerto Rico has an average income,
approximately half of that of 

104
00:06:02,961 --> 00:06:06,140
Mississippi and is poorer than any state
in the United States.

105
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:09,020
It's cost of living surpasses the 
average state.

106
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,520
All of this leads to a really crazy 
situation.

107
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:21,070
Minimum wage and welfare policy,

108
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,223
uh,

109
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:25,580
full of that wasn't enough.
Believe me,

110
00:06:25,610 --> 00:06:28,190
there is more.
The average salary in Puerto Rico is the

111
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:32,270
same as the federal minimum wage.
That is $7 and 25 cents per hour.

112
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,133
The thing is that as we've seen,
both the development level and the 

113
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,134
average income in Puerto Rico are much 
lower than those of the US states 

114
00:06:38,991 --> 00:06:41,360
causing this policies distorting effects
to be,

115
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,470
well,
pretty enormous.

116
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:44,973
Okay.

117
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,600
You see the federal minimum wage in New 
York or Illinois,

118
00:06:51,601 --> 00:06:52,890
matter of fact,
very few people,

119
00:06:52,891 --> 00:06:54,750
but in Puerto Rico it's really 
different.

120
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,613
The federal minimum wage is the 
equivalent of 77% of the average salary 

121
00:06:58,561 --> 00:06:59,394
in Puerto Rico.
That is the average salary of every 

122
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:03,270
profession and every job on the island.

123
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:11,290
This is led only one in three people of 
working age to actually do so.

124
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,710
And if this number,
it wasn't already abnormally low,

125
00:07:13,711 --> 00:07:16,560
over a quarter of people with jobs,
I think worked for the government.

126
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:17,423
This means that less than 25% of the 
island's population works in the actual 

127
00:07:20,970 --> 00:07:22,920
productive economy.
On the other hand,

128
00:07:22,921 --> 00:07:26,850
the federal regulation also implies an 
abnormally high level of social benefits

129
00:07:26,851 --> 00:07:28,650
for Puerto Rico's parameters.
In fact,

130
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,513
studies show that for many families it 
is more convenient to receive social 

131
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:33,264
aids than to actually go to work because
the income they'll receive is 

132
00:07:36,011 --> 00:07:41,011
substantially higher.
Well,

133
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,064
folks,
the results of these five federal 

134
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:48,524
policies has led to a huge crisis,
a crisis that has lasted more than 10 

135
00:07:52,281 --> 00:07:53,114
years,
which has caused or has at least fuels 

136
00:07:54,470 --> 00:07:55,303
the island's bankruptcy and just 
generated a gigantic exodus of people 

137
00:07:58,640 --> 00:08:02,330
who escaped to the consonants,
especially of course the youngest.

138
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:07,560
As we saw here on visual politic in a 
previous video,

139
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:10,890
I need the last 10 years,
500,000

140
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:11,724
Puerto Rican stuff,
packed their bags and to moved to the 

141
00:08:13,771 --> 00:08:16,860
continents.
That's one in every seven people.

142
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,290
There's a lot of talk about how to solve
the island's problems,

143
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:22,590
but the question is,
is Puerto Rico's current connection with

144
00:08:22,591 --> 00:08:25,890
the United States compatible with any of
these solutions?

145
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:26,753
Well,
leave your answer to that in the 

146
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,490
comments below,
as well as in this survey.
