1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,353
It's no secret Israel and the Arab 
countries have never had a good 

2
00:00:12,601 --> 00:00:16,860
relationship and they've always had a 
pretty terrible one.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:19,260
Three wars,
dozens of diplomatic conflict,

4
00:00:19,261 --> 00:00:21,330
send all kinds of accusations.

5
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:24,563
The Arab Israeli conflict was one of the
hottest in the second half of the 20th 

6
00:00:27,661 --> 00:00:28,494
century.
So when you have problems with your 

7
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:31,080
neighbors,
well you have a problem,

8
00:00:31,081 --> 00:00:34,530
but if your neighbors are the largest 
oil producers in the world,

9
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,440
well then you really have a much bigger 
problem.

10
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,303
This is especially true when you 
consider that Israel has always been 

11
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:43,260
considered something of an energy 
wasteland.

12
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:46,200
All attempts to find oil there weren't 
been successful.

13
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:50,640
Now it is true that up until 1979,
Israel has a nice Aulani in the region.

14
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:52,860
Can you guess which country this was?
Well,

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,740
you might be surprised to learn that it 
was Iran.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,701
Yep,
that's right.

17
00:00:56,701 --> 00:01:00,660
In the Times of the shower of Persia,
Iran was a close ally of Israel.

18
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:01,553
After all,
they both had a common enemy and that 

19
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,880
was the Arabic countries for the first 
time.

20
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,714
We see them arriving at Parliament House
to take over the range of Apis that 

21
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,460
these countries and such a close 
relationship that in 1978,

22
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:18,270
Israel offered the shower of punisher 
help in building nuclear power plants.

23
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:19,800
Yes,
really,

24
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:22,620
however,
that all changed in 1979 with Khomeini's

25
00:01:22,621 --> 00:01:25,620
revolution.
From that moment on Israel and Iran went

26
00:01:25,621 --> 00:01:27,330
from being good friends too.
Well,

27
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:28,500
great enemies.

28
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,460
The thing is that Israel has always had 
two main weaknesses.

29
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,294
The first is this bad relations with 
countries in the region and the seconds 

30
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:42,390
are the difficulties they've had 
ensuring that oil supply,

31
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,253
especially when facing conflict,
the minister for energy in Israel 

32
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:50,150
admitted in 2014.
This real situation is complicated.

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,713
Don't have diplomatic relations with 
most of the countries from which we 

34
00:01:54,271 --> 00:01:56,820
import oil,
Yusef Paritski.

35
00:01:56,940 --> 00:01:59,340
However,
it seems as if all of this,

36
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:00,203
it's about to change gift gift.
That is the definition Benjamin 

37
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,400
Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister,

38
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,293
gave to the latest discoveries made in 
the Mediterranean Sea discoveries which 

39
00:02:15,361 --> 00:02:16,194
might change forever.
These strategic reality of the conflict 

40
00:02:18,111 --> 00:02:18,944
of region of the Middle East,
but now you are probably wondering what 

41
00:02:24,910 --> 00:02:26,980
might those discoveries beat?
Well,

42
00:02:26,981 --> 00:02:27,814
pay attention to this map.
Each yellow piece represents the newly 

43
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,350
discovered natural gas

44
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,193
fields

45
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:35,743
and these are not small fields,
either the last of them to be found and 

46
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:42,830
known as Leviathan is one of the largest
reserves founds in the last few decades.

47
00:02:46,210 --> 00:02:47,043
Israel has done everything they could 
since 1952 in order to find oil or gas 

48
00:02:50,681 --> 00:02:53,140
in that territory.
Something that they could achieve energy

49
00:02:53,141 --> 00:02:55,390
independence,
but I'm until the year 2000.

50
00:02:55,391 --> 00:02:57,700
All of their attempts,
they were unsuccessful.

51
00:02:58,570 --> 00:03:01,120
If you were 10 years ago,
15 years ago,

52
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
and I said Israel would find a big 
amount of energy and be almost totally 

53
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:08,200
independent when it comes to energy,
you would think that I am crazy.

54
00:03:08,350 --> 00:03:11,470
We were the country of milk and honey,
but when it came to oil,

55
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,610
we've left it to our neighbors.
Not t beren boy Thomas Group.

56
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,980
However,
everything started to change in the year

57
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,920
2000 thanks to technology.
When a tax company,

58
00:03:20,921 --> 00:03:24,280
Nobel energy founds the first reserve in
the open sea,

59
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:26,590
known as Mari,
be this first one,

60
00:03:26,591 --> 00:03:27,424
it was small,
but it was a turning point because they 

61
00:03:28,931 --> 00:03:29,764
knew that under the sea,
on the sea bed that were surprises 

62
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:33,514
waiting,
so noble energy kept exploring the 

63
00:03:35,171 --> 00:03:37,870
bottom of the sea and in 2009 they hit 
the Jack.

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,540
They found it for you tomorrow reserves,
so you science was significance.

65
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,300
In fact,
the reserve provides Israel with half of

66
00:03:50,301 --> 00:03:54,050
that electricity requirements last year,
later in 2010.

67
00:03:54,051 --> 00:03:55,760
Well they did.
It just hit the Jackpot.

68
00:03:55,761 --> 00:03:58,830
In the casino,
they won the lottery after spending only

69
00:03:58,900 --> 00:03:59,733
$100,
million dollars in the exploration of 

70
00:04:00,861 --> 00:04:03,440
the area,
noble energy hits Leviathan,

71
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,403
an enormous field.
So now you're probably starting to 

72
00:04:06,771 --> 00:04:09,420
understand what's going on here,
a little best app.

73
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,333
It is estimated that this reserve is 
larger than all of the ones found in 

74
00:04:13,341 --> 00:04:17,120
countries like Bolivia or Mexico as 
well.

75
00:04:17,121 --> 00:04:21,020
This is not the end of the story because
most of this area is still unexplored.

76
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:21,913
In fact,
the geological studies have indicated 

77
00:04:23,211 --> 00:04:27,290
that there is much more natural gas 
5,000 meters below the surface.

78
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:29,570
Oh,
there is also oil.

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,473
Moreover,
the government estimates that the 

80
00:04:31,101 --> 00:04:31,934
Mediterranean could be holding a 
colossal wealth in natural gas and oil 

81
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:38,120
as well.
This falls within Israeli waters.

82
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:39,653
In total,
the government estimates that there 

83
00:04:40,401 --> 00:04:41,234
might be more than 3 trillion cubic 
meters of gas and 6 billion barrels of 

84
00:04:45,141 --> 00:04:47,090
oil.
All right,

85
00:04:47,091 --> 00:04:47,924
that's all well and good,
but what exactly is 3 trillion cubic 

86
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:52,960
meters?
I mean it's not exactly easy to picture,

87
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,120
so you can appreciate the songs of this.
If these estimations.

88
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:57,440
All right,
Israel,

89
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,283
a small country of only around $8 
million inhabitants could become one of 

90
00:05:01,071 --> 00:05:01,904
the top 15 countries when it comes to 
natural gas reserves and in the top 20 

91
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:07,040
countries when it comes to it

92
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:07,893
oil.

93
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:17,633
This is not just for Israel exports.
They've already started at the end of 

94
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:21,914
2016 Israeli companies reached an 
agreement with the government of Jordan 

95
00:05:24,831 --> 00:05:27,500
to become its main supplier for the next
15 years.

96
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,393
It's a contract will have more than 
$10,000,000,000 between 50 and 60 

97
00:05:32,151 --> 00:05:32,984
percent of that money is going straight 
to the coffers of the Israeli 

98
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:36,343
government.
That's the right division of politic 

99
00:05:37,291 --> 00:05:38,540
view,
or in the next few decades,

100
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,374
the government of Israel is going to get
an income in the tens of billions of 

101
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,020
dollars,
tentative estimations,

102
00:05:44,021 --> 00:05:44,854
and I confirmed we would be talking 
about hundreds of billions of dollars 

103
00:05:48,410 --> 00:05:49,243
and there's more.
It looks like Israel lacks continental 

104
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:53,540
oil,
but there could be in massive quantities

105
00:05:53,541 --> 00:05:54,374
of shale oil.
The type of oil that can be extracted 

106
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:57,224
through fracking well,
they've already found the first 

107
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:04,610
reserves.
This means that not only is Israel going

108
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:05,444
to achieve energy independence,
but it could even become a new energy 

109
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:09,140
power.

110
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:13,310
Now you might know why ness and Yahoo,
it has referred to these fields as God's

111
00:06:13,311 --> 00:06:14,660
gift.
A few years ago,

112
00:06:14,690 --> 00:06:15,523
golden year,
the ex prime minister told this famous 

113
00:06:17,571 --> 00:06:18,404
joke.
Let me tell you something that we 

114
00:06:19,821 --> 00:06:20,654
Israelis have against Moses.
He took us 40 years through the desert 

115
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:26,510
in order to bring us to the one spot in 
the Middle East that has no oil.

116
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,910
Golda Meir,
well,

117
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,910
it sure looks like this is no longer the
case and to this discovery,

118
00:06:31,911 --> 00:06:32,744
the fact that Israel is one of the most 
innovative countries in the world and 

119
00:06:35,301 --> 00:06:36,134
it's entirely possible,
it could soon become one of the world's 

120
00:06:38,541 --> 00:06:39,950
wealthiest countries.
Oh,

121
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,980
it's also probably important that we 
mentioned another player here.

122
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,130
Can you guess who were the first to have
an interest in these reserves?

123
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:47,660
It was the Russians.
Yep.

124
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,553
Again,
really Gazprom actually tried to buy 

125
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,494
them.
This all indicates that Israel could 

126
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:55,970
take part of the Russian gas market 
share in Europe,

127
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:56,893
and as you already know,
energy means money and influence new 

128
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:03,284
allies.

129
00:07:04,070 --> 00:07:07,400
The international situation of Israel,
it's always been controversial,

130
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:10,310
was political conflict.
The UN resolutions,

131
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:11,173
the Israeli Minister of foreign affairs 
has to work harder than Santa Claus on 

132
00:07:13,671 --> 00:07:16,970
Christmas Eve.
Consider the last events from the UN.

133
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,100
UN Security Council passes resolution 
demanding end to Israeli settlements.

134
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:23,750
Well,
despite all of this,

135
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:26,720
the truth is that Israeli foreign policy
is stronger than ever.

136
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:27,583
Israeli authorities are determined to 
put an end to their dependence on the 

137
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,520
United States and these recent gas and 
oil discoveries have certainly helps.

138
00:07:34,550 --> 00:07:35,383
For example,
relations with their neighboring 

139
00:07:36,231 --> 00:07:37,064
countries have improved quickly and by a
great amount in 2010 relations with 

140
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,374
Turkey,
you broke down almost completely when 

141
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:45,770
Israel approached the freedom flow 
tiller,

142
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,633
but now these relations at being healed.
This probably has a lot to do with the 

143
00:07:49,581 --> 00:07:50,414
fact that Erdogan is country uses up 
massive quantities of natural gas and 

144
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:54,704
they're important agreements with the 
Russia will be over in just five years 

145
00:07:57,350 --> 00:07:58,183
and we already know how unstable 
relations are lately between these two 

146
00:08:01,130 --> 00:08:01,880
countries.

147
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:04,400
Things are also working out great with 
their other neighbors.

148
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,310
Egypt and Jordan.
Israel hasn't just become Jordan's major

149
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:09,950
gas supplier,
but the relations with Egypt are working

150
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:13,750
so well that shall keep the minister of 
Foreign Affairs Watch footballs,

151
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:17,570
European Championship final in the 
residence of the Israeli prime minister.

152
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,030
Further the unimaginable it could even 
be happening.

153
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:23,930
Some are talking about reconciliation 
between Israel and Saudi Arabia.

154
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,723
Israel,
Saudi Arabia are reportedly negotiating 

155
00:08:27,890 --> 00:08:28,723
economic ties.
Israel is also bonding with Tsipras 

156
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,293
Greece,
which has surprisingly the come a close 

157
00:08:33,381 --> 00:08:34,160
ally.
In fact,

158
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:36,530
the Israeli air force is now training in
Greece,

159
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:41,060
but the really major change has been 
from the east ends in this process.

160
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:44,390
India was key.
India has made Israel its second largest

161
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,850
arms supplier behind Russia in the last 
decade.

162
00:08:46,851 --> 00:08:50,990
India has bought from Israel more than 
$10,000,000,000 of military equipment.

163
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,680
Their relations are so good.
In fact,

164
00:08:52,681 --> 00:08:54,990
so this in 2015 for the first time in 
history,

165
00:08:55,030 --> 00:08:58,050
the president of India went to Israel on
an official visit.

166
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:01,483
All right.
Jump Modi to become first Indian prime 

167
00:09:03,431 --> 00:09:06,360
minister to visit.
I'm.

168
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,400
Let's just add one more thing on their 
subjects.

169
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:09,293
Up until now,
Greece and India had been very critical 

170
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:14,790
of Israel as a consequence of the 
situation with Palestine,

171
00:09:14,791 --> 00:09:15,624
so you can imagine what a step this was 
for the Israeli Ministry of Foreign 

172
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:19,463
Affairs and India is not the only one.
Israel is also building a close 

173
00:09:22,321 --> 00:09:26,130
relationship with China and they own 
negotiating a free trade agreements.

174
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,490
It's the only Chinese businessman then 
making strong investments in the country

175
00:09:29,550 --> 00:09:30,383
and think even building a port in the 
city of Ashdod as part of their Silk 

176
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:35,733
Road Jack,

177
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:42,630
so their relationships developing with 
Vietnam,

178
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:45,900
South Korea.
It really seems that anywhere in Asia,

179
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:50,460
Israel is a total success only we 
haven't forgotten about Donald Trump who

180
00:09:50,461 --> 00:09:52,110
for now mez committed to this.

181
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,033
It's our true friend over there and 
we're going to protect Israel 100 

182
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:57,680
percent

183
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,513
anyway.
There's still a long way to go for 

184
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:01,910
Israel to become an energy power,
but if they do,

185
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,700
it will have a positive effect for the 
area's stability,

186
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:07,400
which think would be a very good thing.
Indeed.

187
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:09,680
Israel is well on its way to becoming a 
great country,

188
00:10:09,681 --> 00:10:10,514
but there are still some things that 
need to be dealt with like the conflict 

189
00:10:12,981 --> 00:10:13,814
in Palestine.
Luckily better relations with Arabic 

190
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:17,840
countries could help in this matter a 
lot.

191
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:20,630
So now what do you think?
Do you think that this new energy wealth

192
00:10:20,631 --> 00:10:23,540
will contribute to the solution of this 
conflict?
