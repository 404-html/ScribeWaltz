1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
[inaudible].

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,170
He's a politician,
but he's not just any politician.

3
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,153
His biography is what you'd expect from 
the protagonist of a best selling 

4
00:00:15,551 --> 00:00:16,980
political fiction novel.
However,

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:17,853
the viewer,
this is a flesh and blood politician 

6
00:00:20,081 --> 00:00:22,570
with both the good side and the dark 
side.

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,500
We're talking about Benjamin Netanyahu,
Israel's prime minister,

8
00:00:26,530 --> 00:00:27,363
and it's the most powerful politician in
the country has had in the last two 

9
00:00:29,921 --> 00:00:30,754
decades.

10
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:35,880
This is a country that works.
People work the invent things,

11
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:41,270
and when things that change live,
this is past is future.

12
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,613
Yes,
I found in the Times that I've been in 

13
00:00:45,061 --> 00:00:45,894
government that the most rapid 
technology transfers occur when 

14
00:00:49,831 --> 00:00:53,700
businesses operate within Israel is 
often called the startup nation.

15
00:00:54,060 --> 00:00:54,893
I call it the innovation nation.
The future belongs to those who 

16
00:00:59,731 --> 00:01:00,564
innovate.
Those who don't innovate rather than 

17
00:01:02,071 --> 00:01:04,170
companies or in countries will fall 
behind.

18
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:05,183
Innovation is the only way to 
consistently add value to your products 

19
00:01:10,591 --> 00:01:14,490
and services in an increasingly 
competitive global economy.

20
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,220
Bye.
You may be wondering,

21
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:21,560
why are we talking about Netanyahu 
today?

22
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,780
Why is he so important?
Well,

23
00:01:23,781 --> 00:01:26,120
folks,
what if I told you that this man was the

24
00:01:26,121 --> 00:01:26,954
architect?
He basically designs the Israel that we 

25
00:01:28,941 --> 00:01:29,840
know today.
Yes,

26
00:01:30,050 --> 00:01:31,160
you heard that,
right?

27
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:32,023
We're talking about a politician who has
so much character that he actually 

28
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:35,504
attacked the very presidents of the 
United States in front of his own 

29
00:01:37,941 --> 00:01:39,110
congress.
Yes,

30
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:41,030
indeed.
This happened to Barack Obama,

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,170
so don't tell me that this guy isn't

32
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:47,670
huff before lifting those restrictions,
the world should demand that you long to

33
00:01:47,671 --> 00:01:50,230
do three things.
First,

34
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,570
stop.
It's aggression against its neighbors in

35
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:54,130
the Middle East.
Second,

36
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:56,560
stopped supporting terrorism around the 
world,

37
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:57,543
and third,
stop threatening you are nine late my 

38
00:02:00,881 --> 00:02:01,810
country,
Israel.

39
00:02:01,811 --> 00:02:02,850
The one and only

40
00:02:03,230 --> 00:02:08,230
[inaudible]

41
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:16,160
fact is that Benjamin Netanyahu or bibby
as is known in Israel,

42
00:02:18,670 --> 00:02:22,810
done practically everything in his 
country during his time as a soldier.

43
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,703
And remember here,
the military service is mandatory in 

44
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:27,850
Israel.
He commanded a special forces unit,

45
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:31,220
antibiotic [inaudible] and plenty of 
operations which have names liquid you'd

46
00:02:31,221 --> 00:02:32,054
see in a Hollywood movie,
names like operation in Ferno hands 

47
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,490
operation,
a tape where by the way,

48
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,324
ness and Yahoo was shot while his unit 
rescue to plane hijacked by the 

49
00:02:40,211 --> 00:02:43,060
terrorist group,
the Black September organization.

50
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,040
Look,
I'm 28 years old.

51
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,220
I've had to defend my country in two 
wars and in many battles

52
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:49,373
as a soldier.
He also participated in operations in 

53
00:02:51,421 --> 00:02:53,190
Egypt,
Syria and Jordan.

54
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:57,960
That's not all.
After finishing his military service,

55
00:02:57,961 --> 00:03:01,030
this prime minister went to the United 
States to study as well.

56
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:02,500
Now you might be wondering,
well where did he study?

57
00:03:02,501 --> 00:03:07,420
Well first it was mit and then it was 
Harvard and by the way,

58
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:08,254
here's some curious trivia.
In 1973 when the Yom Kippur war broke 

59
00:03:11,291 --> 00:03:13,330
out between Israel and its Arab 
neighbors,

60
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:14,223
Netanyahu who was studying in Boston 
returned home to rejoin the special 

61
00:03:17,711 --> 00:03:20,680
forces until the war ended.
But moving on from Trivia,

62
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,573
that's continued.
The fact is that after studying in the 

63
00:03:24,491 --> 00:03:27,280
United States and spending some time 
working in consulting,

64
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:30,820
he got involved in politics where again,
he's done everything.

65
00:03:30,850 --> 00:03:35,050
He has been a member of parliaments and 
Ambassador to the UN Minister of foreign

66
00:03:35,051 --> 00:03:36,670
affairs,
Minister of finance,

67
00:03:36,671 --> 00:03:39,220
and of course prime minister for four 
towns.

68
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,360
In fact,
my friends,

69
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:41,223
he's about to become the Israeli prime 
minister with the longest time in 

70
00:03:44,861 --> 00:03:45,910
office.
However,

71
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:49,330
now his position of influence and power 
is being questions.

72
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,140
So let's take a look at what is 
happening or why this man is an election

73
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,730
winning machine

74
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,573
cornered

75
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,110
on February the 12th 2018 after a year 
of investigations,

76
00:04:09,111 --> 00:04:09,944
the Israeli police recommended the 
attorney general bring charges against 

77
00:04:12,921 --> 00:04:17,640
Benjamin Netanyahu.
You see the police state there are clear

78
00:04:17,641 --> 00:04:19,830
indications of corruption,
bribes,

79
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:20,723
and influence peddling.
They accused the prime minister of 

80
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:23,754
having received gifts of hundreds of 
thousands of dollars of having good 

81
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:27,414
spires do influence the media and also 
of having protected millionaire 

82
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,810
corruption in the multimillion dollar 
process of buying German submarines.

83
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,153
And do you know what?
This isn't the first time that Israel 

84
00:04:40,161 --> 00:04:41,260
is,
police have accused him.

85
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:42,123
They also did it in 1997 and again in 
1999 during that and Yahoo's first term 

86
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,990
as prime minister back then the 
accusations ended with no charges.

87
00:04:50,050 --> 00:04:50,883
And now again,
the prime minister has made it very 

88
00:04:52,871 --> 00:04:53,704
clear that he will not yield nothing.
We'll have sway and nothing will sway 

89
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,074
me.
Not even the incessant attacks against 

90
00:05:00,881 --> 00:05:02,320
me,
Benjamin Netanyahu.

91
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:05,170
The truth is that whether or not he's 
finally accused.

92
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:08,380
Netanyahu is on the line.
By the way it Israel,

93
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:09,273
nobody is immune to justice.
In the last decades they have condemned 

94
00:05:11,681 --> 00:05:13,420
and the prison's a former prime 
minister,

95
00:05:13,421 --> 00:05:16,590
accurate almost has an ex presidents,
Moshe Katsav.

96
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,580
So if Fidessa Yard,
he was guilty and he's got a pain.

97
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:22,410
Therefore it,
if you were in this video,

98
00:05:22,411 --> 00:05:24,670
we're going to get to know Israelis,
prime minister besser.

99
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:25,504
We're going to take a look.
It is good and his bad side and 

100
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:27,893
investigates what made an and Yahoo is 
such an important character in Israel's 

101
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:36,050
politics.
He beebe the savior.

102
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:45,170
Listen,
you're,

103
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,150
we might not be the most popular guy on 
the planets,

104
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:50,870
but one thing is absolutely certain.
Every time bibby has come to power,

105
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:52,220
he's done.
So I was a very,

106
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:53,450
very difficult conditions.

107
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:55,670
Sure.
During

108
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,503
his first term when he came to power 
1996 the country was greatly unbalanced 

109
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:03,680
with an uncontrolled public and deficits
and growing external debt.

110
00:06:05,150 --> 00:06:05,983
In 2003 when he was appointed minister 
of finance under aerial Sharon's 

111
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,674
governments.
If the country was undergoing its worst 

112
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,314
recession and the most current time was 
in 2009 just when his country was 

113
00:06:15,741 --> 00:06:19,520
suffering the consequences of the 
greater international financial crisis.

114
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:21,740
Well,
in all these cases,

115
00:06:21,741 --> 00:06:24,740
Netanyahu's recipes they works.
And not only that,

116
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,603
with his policies,
pity has transformed this country's 

117
00:06:27,351 --> 00:06:29,810
identity.
Thanks largely to his governance.

118
00:06:29,811 --> 00:06:33,380
Israel has gone from being a place with 
chronic imbalances and crises.

119
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,040
A country,
there's,

120
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:34,873
in 1984 had to be rescued by the United 
States to becoming a prosperous country 

121
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:39,613
with well organized accounts and say 
worldwide power in technology and 

122
00:06:42,801 --> 00:06:47,801
innovation.
Through all this,

123
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:50,703
we can understand how despite all the 
controversy maybe continues to raise 

124
00:06:53,621 --> 00:06:55,210
passions,
some against him,

125
00:06:55,270 --> 00:06:59,590
but many in favor of him,
but many of you might not be thinking,

126
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:00,610
okay,
but what,

127
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:01,750
where?
Or rather,

128
00:07:01,751 --> 00:07:06,010
what are Benjamin Netanyahu's recipes?
While that's exactly what we're going to

129
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:06,844
look at next.
Traditionally Israel was a socialist 

130
00:07:11,851 --> 00:07:14,160
country with high taxes,
a lot of regulation,

131
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:15,960
and a very large governments.
Well,

132
00:07:15,990 --> 00:07:16,823
they're these mission was to change this
model once and for all and in force 

133
00:07:19,081 --> 00:07:19,914
another that would organize the accounts
and improve the country's competitive 

134
00:07:23,260 --> 00:07:23,940
dust.
I mean,

135
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:25,830
check this out.
You think that

136
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:30,770
mathematicians and computer engineers or
mechanical engineers or doctors or first

137
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,840
they're very important,
but they're not first,

138
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,793
they're second.
There was a country that had the best 

139
00:07:35,211 --> 00:07:37,430
mathematicians,
the best physicists,

140
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,820
the best metallurgists in the world,
but that country was very poor.

141
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:44,750
It was called the Soviet Union.
What comes first is markets.

142
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:45,763
This was the main thing that I tried to 
bring to the Israeli economy in my own 

143
00:07:48,711 --> 00:07:50,180
way.
Benjamin Netanyahu

144
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:51,213
with this idea in mind and its first 
mandate in 1996 is number one priority 

145
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,833
was to reduce the public deficits.
Privatized banks and large government 

146
00:07:58,601 --> 00:08:01,450
owned companies and suppress capital 
controls.

147
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,530
For example,
at that time,

148
00:08:02,531 --> 00:08:03,364
Israelis had a restriction on the money 
that they could take out of the country 

149
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:08,110
and to use for buying foreign currency.
Yes,

150
00:08:08,111 --> 00:08:08,944
we could say that the Israel of the 
nineties resembled the coaching is 

151
00:08:11,411 --> 00:08:12,244
Argentina,
a lot of public spending and capital 

152
00:08:14,111 --> 00:08:16,210
controls,
but let's continue.

153
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,343
In 2003 when the country was undergoing 
a terrible crisis as minister of 

154
00:08:24,071 --> 00:08:26,230
finance,
Minister of Finance with a lot of power.

155
00:08:26,231 --> 00:08:27,064
By the way,
Netanyahu froze public spending and 

156
00:08:28,991 --> 00:08:31,570
launched a huge tax reduction.
For example,

157
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:36,160
he reduced corporate income tax as well 
as individual income tax by half.

158
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:40,600
See,
when he arrived at the ministry,

159
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:45,160
the maximum rate on income in terms of 
wages was 64% when he left,

160
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,083
it was 44% a 20 point reduction in just 
two years and when he came to power in 

161
00:08:50,531 --> 00:08:53,500
2009 he had a similar recipe that's 
public spending,

162
00:08:53,501 --> 00:08:58,501
fewer taxes and less.
In addition,

163
00:09:00,511 --> 00:09:01,344
in recent years,
he managed to get Israel once and for 

164
00:09:02,761 --> 00:09:05,940
all to exploit its huge natural gas 
reserves.

165
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:11,110
Israel bolsters Egypt ties with $15 
billion gas deal.

166
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,950
It was precisely because of this that 
many believe Israel is miracle would not

167
00:09:14,951 --> 00:09:17,170
have been possible without this prime 
minister,

168
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,620
but don't think that he has only had 
good results in the economic sector,

169
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,493
not at all

170
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:22,903
in the 37 months that Netanyahu held 
office Israeli citizens enjoyed or one 

171
00:09:27,801 --> 00:09:31,910
of the safest and quietest periods with 
regards to terrorism.

172
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,450
Of the five is really leaders examined 
Robin Perez,

173
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:37,160
Netanyahu,
Brock Sharone,

174
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,113
Netanyahu's policies with regards to the
prevention and deterrence of terrorism 

175
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:43,010
where the most effective

176
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:47,380
indeed in addition to the economy,
Israeli society recognizes net and Yahoo

177
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:48,243
has having made Israel a safer country.
I save the country and also very 

178
00:09:52,061 --> 00:09:55,030
importantly the country that is much 
more open to the world.

179
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,370
So much so that this prime minister has 
succeeded.

180
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,760
And this is not here because I think 
this will amaze you in getting relations

181
00:10:00,761 --> 00:10:04,990
between Israel and the Arab countries to
go smoothly.

182
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,200
And this is something that we certainly 
need to dive more into man.

183
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,160
What do that right now,

184
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,800
external approach.

185
00:10:20,490 --> 00:10:24,120
So you probably know the popular saying 
my enemy's enemy is my friend.

186
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,013
Well,
it looks as if something like this is 

187
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,544
happening in the Middle East with Iran 
and to with fundamentalist groups like 

188
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,223
Isis.
I mean check all the news that the New 

189
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,460
York Times published on February the 
third 2018

190
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:41,050
secret alliance is real carries out air 
strikes in Egypt with Kairos.

191
00:10:41,051 --> 00:10:43,510
Okay.
Pay Close attention to this new spot.

192
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,373
In the last two years,
Israel has carried out more than a 

193
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,840
hundred area.
The tax with planes,

194
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:53,010
helicopters and drones against 
fundamentalist groups in Egypt's,

195
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:53,853
particularly against the so called 
Islamic state of Sinai that is an Arab 

196
00:10:56,861 --> 00:10:57,850
governments.
In this case,

197
00:10:57,851 --> 00:10:58,684
the Egyptian government has authorized 
Israel to carry out attacks and 

198
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:04,300
operations within its territory,
which is really quite amazing,

199
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:07,230
but that's not all.
Israel's relations with Jordan and Egypt

200
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:08,064
are better than ever,
but they're also growing stronger with 

201
00:11:09,851 --> 00:11:12,310
other Arab countries including Saudi 
Arabia.

202
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,600
Yep.
You heard that rise.

203
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:17,020
Now they still aren't formal but they 
are happening behind closed doors.

204
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:18,733
There is an alignment of Israel and 
other countries in the Middle East that 

205
00:11:21,381 --> 00:11:24,200
would have been on imaginable 10 years 
ago.

206
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,200
Certainly in my lifetime I never saw 
anything like it.

207
00:11:27,201 --> 00:11:30,020
And I met the age of the state of Israel
have more or less.

208
00:11:30,021 --> 00:11:31,730
So it's an extraordinary thing.

209
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,763
So how about another example?
Well after 70 years of prohibition and 

210
00:11:34,871 --> 00:11:35,704
for the first time Saudi Arabia has 
authorized in Israeli commercial flight 

211
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:39,753
to cross it's ass space since March Air 
India flights between New Delhi and Tel 

212
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,220
Aviv.
Well cross Saudi ass space.

213
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,940
This might seem like a small step but 
it's written not and you know what?

214
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:52,930
It's not just the Arab countries.
The prime minister has set his sights on

215
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:56,590
the and there's also establish 
surprisingly good relations with India,

216
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,080
Australia,
Singapore and even China.

217
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:04,190
We are very much very much excited by 
the belt and road initiative and what we

218
00:12:05,581 --> 00:12:06,414
feel is merely an express lane.
This belt and road that is called the 

219
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:13,590
China is going to relations

220
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:17,650
and once more that's in Yahoo led the 
first visit of an Israeli prime minister

221
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:20,860
to Latin America in 2017 he visited 
Mexico.

222
00:12:20,861 --> 00:12:25,861
Columbia and sergeants has an Africa.
Wow.

223
00:12:26,771 --> 00:12:27,604
Smart.

224
00:12:32,380 --> 00:12:37,090
Israel is coming back to Africa and 
Africa is coming back to Israel.

225
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:41,563
Okay.

226
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,003
In fact,
that's in Yahoo was the first Israeli 

227
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:45,923
needed to visit this consonant since the
1960s and many African leaders aren't 

228
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:51,570
delighted with Israel's money and 
Israel's technology.

229
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:52,453
Jake,

230
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,620
diversity and richness.
I saw passion and productivity.

231
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,710
I saw a young African entrepreneurs who 
are building companies,

232
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:04,700
harnessing the power of the digital age.
Africans are seizing the future.

233
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,640
Israel wants to seize this future with 
you.

234
00:13:07,850 --> 00:13:08,683
In short,
as you can see you both in the economic 

235
00:13:10,071 --> 00:13:12,320
field as well as insecurity and foreign 
policy.

236
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:14,930
There's prime minister as many reasons 
to be proud,

237
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:18,470
but of course not.
Everything is a bed of roses here.

238
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:25,460
Okay.

239
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:26,293
Dark side.

240
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,260
Okay.

241
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:31,180
We just announced it before on visual 
politic.

242
00:13:31,181 --> 00:13:32,014
One of the greatest problems we see with
Benjamin Netanyahu in addition to his 

243
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:35,344
corruption suspicions,
is his position towards the West Bank 

244
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:38,620
settlements.
Yes.

245
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,510
And that's in Yahoo supports these 
settlements,

246
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:43,240
continual growth.
And as we saw in recent years,

247
00:13:43,241 --> 00:13:46,510
this government has promoted to policy 
to expand and consolidate them,

248
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:51,700
and it's more than three years in power.
This government has been irrational,

249
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:56,050
bordering on the messianic does now 
increasingly clear where it is headed.

250
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:56,943
Creeping annexation of the West Bank 
aimed at precluding any permanent 

251
00:14:00,581 --> 00:14:04,870
separation from the Palestinians who 
barack former prime minister of Israel.

252
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,793
And besides these settlements,
Netanyahu's power relations with some 

253
00:14:08,141 --> 00:14:11,500
magnates a raw,
so Ashley put it questionable.

254
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,273
For example,
his friends and gambling mogul Sheldon 

255
00:14:16,350 --> 00:14:17,183
Adelson invested $200 million into 
Israel high on a free newspaper that 

256
00:14:20,401 --> 00:14:21,840
greatly favors net in the yard.

257
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,793
Hi,

258
00:14:23,780 --> 00:14:24,613
a question that arises is what you have 
to return the favor and other 

259
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,860
significance.
Parts of Netanyahu's dark side has to do

260
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:31,813
with his way of doing politics is a 
tough opponent who has no qualms about 

261
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:39,230
attacking his rivals through all 
possible means.

262
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:42,470
That is precisely what he did in 1995 
with prime minister.

263
00:14:42,471 --> 00:14:43,304
It's soccer robyn,
who he accused among many other things 

264
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,350
of portraying Jewish values,
potentially need generated,

265
00:14:48,380 --> 00:14:49,213
were so great that many detractors blame
him for the hatred that ended with 

266
00:14:52,611 --> 00:14:54,800
Robin's murder at the hands of an 
extremist.

267
00:14:54,860 --> 00:14:57,620
His critics say that Netanyahu didn't 
pull the trigger,

268
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:00,920
but that is a lack of political piety 
that to the tragedy.

269
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:07,420
So that Divya is the end of this video 
about a politician who has a dark side,

270
00:15:07,421 --> 00:15:08,254
but also a very bright one as well.
He has contributed to making Israel a 

271
00:15:11,321 --> 00:15:13,480
much more prosperous country,
but now it's your turn.

272
00:15:13,510 --> 00:15:14,343
What do you think of Benjamin Netanyahu,
do you think can bibby has been a good 

273
00:15:17,381 --> 00:15:18,490
leader for Israel?
