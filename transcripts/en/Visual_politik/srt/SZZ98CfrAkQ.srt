1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,220
I've gotten a stone is a difficult 
country then many aspects,

2
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:14,790
difficult honestly doesn't really cover 
it.

3
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:16,770
I've gotten a stone is a very 
mountainous country.

4
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:17,604
Almost three quarters of its surface is 
covered by mountains and peaks that in 

5
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,550
many cases exceed 20,000 feet.
Cause then you can probably imagine just

6
00:00:23,551 --> 00:00:27,110
how difficult communications are among 
the different regions of this country as

7
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:27,953
if this was not enough.
It's also a landlocked and it's mostly 

8
00:00:30,091 --> 00:00:31,350
Erin's place.
In fact,

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,720
deserts are not unusual at all in 
Afghanistan

10
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,603
stop.

11
00:00:38,630 --> 00:00:39,463
So despite a few valleys,
it's national landscape is mainly 

12
00:00:41,661 --> 00:00:42,494
composed of red and yellow tones.
But geography is not the worst part of 

13
00:00:45,891 --> 00:00:49,130
this country and neither is a task.
Climate conditions not at all.

14
00:00:49,131 --> 00:00:50,060
In fact,
poverty,

15
00:00:50,090 --> 00:00:53,180
corruption and especially fundamentalism
and violence,

16
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:54,014
all the worst parts of this place.
Afghanistan's if you are above all as a 

17
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,304
country.

18
00:00:58,750 --> 00:00:59,583
Yeah.

19
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:00,503
1978 the sour revolution,
a communist space revolution took place 

20
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:05,783
when you're later in 1979 the Soviet 
army invaded the country to consolidate 

21
00:01:09,271 --> 00:01:10,104
the communist government

22
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,340
since

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:18,650
send the people have not known what 
peace means,

24
00:01:18,651 --> 00:01:19,700
but before,
to be honest,

25
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:21,530
the situation,
it wasn't really good either.

26
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:24,980
Afghanistan was his ends probably will 
be for a long time,

27
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:25,993
one of the poorest countries on earth.
It's also got one of the hardest and 

28
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:31,390
most hostile living conditions,
especially for women

29
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,503
countries.
Six out of every 10 people don't know 

30
00:01:36,481 --> 00:01:37,314
how to read or rice.
Almost half of its population doesn't 

31
00:01:39,021 --> 00:01:39,854
have access to drinking water and it's 
difficult to find a single family which 

32
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:45,410
hasn't been devastated by war and 
violence.

33
00:01:45,411 --> 00:01:46,244
We can safely say that if someone was 
able to choose where they were to be 

34
00:01:48,561 --> 00:01:51,470
born,
no one would ever choose Afghanistan.

35
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,410
The last grade conflicts,
which still persists to this day,

36
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:55,283
it burst onto the global stage in 
October of 2001 when the president of 

37
00:01:58,611 --> 00:02:00,980
the United States at the time,
George W.

38
00:02:00,980 --> 00:02:04,340
Bush decided to invade.
Afghanistan has a response to nine 11 at

39
00:02:04,341 --> 00:02:06,530
that time,
Afghanistan was led by the Taliban,

40
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,280
a radical religious political group,
which protected members of al Qaeda,

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,880
including a solid bin London

42
00:02:12,130 --> 00:02:12,963
on my orders.
The United States military has begun 

43
00:02:15,371 --> 00:02:16,204
strikes against al Qaeda terrorist 
training camps and military 

44
00:02:20,021 --> 00:02:22,830
installations of the Taliban regime in 
Afghanistan.

45
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:24,700
The invasion,
it was fast.

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,420
The Taliban simply weren't an obstacle 
for the massive American war machine.

47
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:30,850
16 years and three presidents later 
though,

48
00:02:30,970 --> 00:02:34,690
and it has been named by many as the 
longest war in US history.

49
00:02:34,750 --> 00:02:36,970
It's already longer than the war in 
Vietnam.

50
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:37,833
I believe it's on,
not the u s that aren't winning that 

51
00:02:39,551 --> 00:02:40,384
one.

52
00:02:45,600 --> 00:02:48,470
What's happening?
16

53
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:49,363
long years of conflict,
occupation and hundreds of billions of 

54
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:52,693
dollars later,
and it would seem logical to think that 

55
00:02:53,641 --> 00:02:54,474
the u s and NATO could have managed to 
have the situation under control and 

56
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:59,620
Afghanistan would be close to reaching 
peace,

57
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,401
right?
Well,

58
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,234
nothing is further from reality.
The truth is that with each day that 

59
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:05,200
goes by,
the Taliban regain grounds.

60
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:07,470
Just take a look at this map from the 
Washington Post.

61
00:03:07,471 --> 00:03:09,600
The colored areas are the ones 
controlled by the talent.

62
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:11,413
Bye.

63
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,420
Um,
well this map shows the situation at the

64
00:03:14,421 --> 00:03:18,680
beginning of 2017 but today things are 
even worse because as we just said,

65
00:03:18,681 --> 00:03:21,280
the Taliban are regaining ground almost 
everyday day.

66
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:28,220
Recent estimates show that the 
governments of cabal us and NATO control

67
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,054
less than 60% of the territory and the 
next map is going to show him even more 

68
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:35,020
Taliban controlled and regions.
Yes,

69
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:38,920
can government controls just 57% of its 
territory you s watchdog set,

70
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,220
but the loss of control by the Afghan 
government seems nuts.

71
00:03:42,221 --> 00:03:45,400
The U S it shouldn't be just seen as a 
territorial losses,

72
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,263
but also an economic loss for example.
It's really important that we ask 

73
00:03:49,031 --> 00:03:50,570
ourselves,
how can the Taliban,

74
00:03:50,571 --> 00:03:51,404
it finance their activity,
where do all of their resources come 

75
00:03:54,101 --> 00:03:54,700
from?
Well,

76
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,100
basically that would be from heroin 
production.

77
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,503
As you might know,
Afghanistan is the biggest opm produce 

78
00:04:00,641 --> 00:04:01,474
it in the whales and this opm,
well that's the raw ingredients that is 

79
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,340
used in heroin.
And listen,

80
00:04:06,341 --> 00:04:09,040
Afghanistan is not just the world's 
biggest producer.

81
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:13,430
It controls between 80 and 90% of opium 
production globally

82
00:04:13,690 --> 00:04:14,523
believe

83
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,010
boom,
comes from Papa Savas,

84
00:04:17,030 --> 00:04:17,863
some different,
the most popular plant among the Afghan 

85
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:20,330
opium farm.

86
00:04:20,330 --> 00:04:21,163
Sure

87
00:04:21,960 --> 00:04:24,450
country.
Most of the population lives off farm

88
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:29,490
say that most of the Afghan economy 
relies on two fields.

89
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:31,860
That's international soldiers,
opm.

90
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,753
In fact,
there's little more to their economy 

91
00:04:33,961 --> 00:04:35,400
than that.
So for quite a while,

92
00:04:35,401 --> 00:04:38,190
the Taliban have controls the opium 
production in this country,

93
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,300
but now they also have realized that 
they can produce the heroin themselves,

94
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,450
which is a much more profitable activity
as well.

95
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,510
That's exactly what they do.

96
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:50,130
Doing everything they harvest is duly 
processed inside the country.

97
00:04:50,190 --> 00:04:53,580
They received more revenue if they 
processed the opening before it has left

98
00:04:53,581 --> 00:04:55,330
the country.
William Brownfield,

99
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,100
US Assistant Secretary for drugs and law
enforcement estimate is to show that the

100
00:04:59,101 --> 00:05:00,410
town of man could be raising about,
yeah,

101
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,333
$3 billion every year from this.
And that's despite all the money that 

102
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:06,980
the u s has wasted trying to stop these 
activities.

103
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:09,170
And after this,
as you can see from this chart,

104
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,153
hasn't been at all.
Despite all the efforts made by the u s 

105
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,390
opium production remains at very high 
levels.

106
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:23,610
As a consequence of having all of these 
resources,

107
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:24,780
the Taliban,
they're managing,

108
00:05:24,781 --> 00:05:28,140
do you sustain a war that is not just 
allowing them to regain ground,

109
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,033
but there's also plunged the country 
into violence and worst of all is that 

110
00:05:31,711 --> 00:05:33,450
future predictions.
They're not very good.

111
00:05:34,370 --> 00:05:37,190
The Taliban are getting stronger.
The government is on the retreat.

112
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:39,620
They're losing ground to the Taliban day
by day.

113
00:05:39,890 --> 00:05:42,350
Abdul Jabbar Carmen,
I retired general.

114
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:43,243
Listen to this.

115
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,163
Taliban army has increased from between 
2000 to 10,000 soldiers in 2005 to more 

116
00:05:48,970 --> 00:05:50,980
than 60,000 today.
But at this point,

117
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:54,370
the question was to become,
why is the u s losing this war?

118
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:59,430
Or at least why aren't they winning the 
Afghan trap?

119
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:10,340
The United States has tried many 
different strategies in Afghanistan,

120
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,100
but it seems that nothing is working.
In fact,

121
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:13,993
generally speaking,
this quite a lot of pessimism over this 

122
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:16,454
conflict.
This is not just a matter of more or 

123
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:19,244
less soldiers.
When Barack Obama was a candidate for 

124
00:06:21,231 --> 00:06:22,064
president,
he repeated all the time that 

125
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,720
Afghanistan was a war.
They need to win.

126
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,080
We did not finish the job against al 
Qaeda in Afghanistan.

127
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,033
We did not develop new capabilities to 
defeat a new enemy or launch a 

128
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:36,830
comprehensive strategy to dry up the 
terrorist base of support.

129
00:06:36,890 --> 00:06:39,860
We did not reaffirm our basic values or 
secure our homeland.

130
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,960
It's time to turn the page.
When I am president,

131
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:44,660
we will wage war.
That has to be what Barack Obama,

132
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,583
when he enrolled me into the White House
and he deployed 100,000 soldiers and 

133
00:06:48,501 --> 00:06:51,710
another 40,000 from NATO.
Even so nothing changed.

134
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:52,700
Many experts say that.

135
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,533
The problem is that President Obama 
insisted all the time on an exit plan 

136
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:58,180
with a Pruett,
withdrawal,

137
00:06:58,181 --> 00:06:59,014
a calendar,
which is sort of like saying to the 

138
00:07:00,021 --> 00:07:00,950
Taliban,
hey look,

139
00:07:00,980 --> 00:07:02,390
you know,
don't worry about any of this.

140
00:07:02,391 --> 00:07:04,250
It's all temporary.
But beyond that,

141
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,280
although the soldiers from the 
international coalition gains grounds,

142
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:10,310
they couldn't gain influence.
And now the question is,

143
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:11,510
why is that?
Well,

144
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:12,344
first of all,
we're talking about a tribal country 

145
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:18,350
with a culture of consolidated violence.
It's not easy for international trips to

146
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:19,184
gain people's trust and be able to 
distinguish civilians from enemies or 

147
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,440
even just know what's happening on the 
grounds.

148
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,333
The cultural leave is absolutely huge 
and having suffered so many years of 

149
00:07:28,611 --> 00:07:30,460
violence means that the Taliban,
yeah,

150
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:32,450
plenty of experience.
On the other hand,

151
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:35,870
there's the corruption and the lack of 
credibility in the local governments.

152
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:36,733
We can safely say that the Afghan 
government has a total lack of 

153
00:07:39,021 --> 00:07:41,720
institutions,
which can provide anything to the Afghan

154
00:07:41,721 --> 00:07:42,200
people.

155
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:44,450
And while there are very few that do 
exist,

156
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:46,640
they are extremely corrupt.
In fact,

157
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,040
this is one of the most corrupt 
countries on earth.

158
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,360
Ordinary Afghans don't like the Taliban,
but they disliked the Afghan government.

159
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:55,220
Even more.
People don't die for an army.

160
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:56,233
They die for a country.
And who wants to die for the current 

161
00:07:57,831 --> 00:07:59,930
Afghan government?
Dexter Filkins,

162
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,823
New Yorker reporter.
With all of this considered and also 

163
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:03,444
adding in the fear of the Taliban.
It's easy to understand is why every 

164
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:07,423
month almost 4,000 soldiers and 
policemen desert to the government of 

165
00:08:10,521 --> 00:08:11,271
qubole.
Further,

166
00:08:11,271 --> 00:08:12,104
we have to say that the strategy,
the u s is taken with the Afghan 

167
00:08:14,271 --> 00:08:16,640
government,
the politics and the institutions.

168
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:17,773
It hasn't worked.
Washington hasn't even made the Afghan 

169
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:23,210
military able to function with the 
exception of the special forces,

170
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:25,850
which is formed of 17,000 elite 
soldiers.

171
00:08:25,910 --> 00:08:28,790
They are the only ones who are really 
fighting the Taliban.

172
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:29,683
Barack Obama understood that the war in 
Afghanistan with something that the 

173
00:08:32,301 --> 00:08:33,134
Afghan people should carry out though 
the u s would be the one paying the 

174
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:36,710
bills.
Today,

175
00:08:36,711 --> 00:08:37,544
I signed a historic agreement between 
the United States and Afghanistan that 

176
00:08:40,331 --> 00:08:43,700
defines a new kind of relationship 
between our countries,

177
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,093
a future in which Afghans are 
responsible for the security of their 

178
00:08:48,351 --> 00:08:49,184
nation among all the problems.
We also have two eyes in one Pakistan 

179
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:56,190
who was being accused of providing 
support to the Taliban and to an economy

180
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:58,920
which doesn't work at all.
And then there's three,

181
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:01,380
a lot of concealed interests.
For example,

182
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:02,214
have you thought about what interests 
Beijing to Ron or Moscow having this 

183
00:09:04,591 --> 00:09:05,970
war?
One thing is clear,

184
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,893
it's countries don't want Afghanistan to
be an American colony because of all of 

185
00:09:10,021 --> 00:09:11,850
this.
After 16 years of war,

186
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,350
the battle,
it continues,

187
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:15,930
but now that the oval office,
there's a new president,

188
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,033
Donald Trump,

189
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:24,740
a huge mistake.

190
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:31,380
Trump has been saying for years that the
war in Afghanistan is a huge mistake and

191
00:09:31,381 --> 00:09:32,214
that the u s has to get out of that.
He said it's of course three his 

192
00:09:34,891 --> 00:09:37,540
favorite communication medium and that 
would be twitter.

193
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:38,423
He repeated it to gain and the gain in 
2011 2012 2013 all the way until his 

194
00:09:44,431 --> 00:09:46,180
2016 cameras

195
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,073
pain.
When will we stop wasting our money on 

196
00:09:49,991 --> 00:09:52,990
rebuilding Afghanistan?
We must rebuild our country first.

197
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:55,203
It's time to get out of Afghanistan.
We're building roads in schools for 

198
00:09:57,371 --> 00:10:00,100
people that hate us.
It's not in our national interest.

199
00:10:01,530 --> 00:10:05,560
Do not allow our very stupid leaders to 
sign a deal that keeps us in Afghanistan

200
00:10:05,561 --> 00:10:09,520
through 2024 with all costs by USA.
Make America Great.

201
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,230
Now Obama is keeping our soldiers in 
Afghanistan for at least another year.

202
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
He is losing two wars simultaneously

203
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:17,133
and it's not just twitter.
Trump insisted again and again and 

204
00:10:18,881 --> 00:10:21,070
again,
but Afghanistan was a mistake.

205
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,933
Have a look at this.

206
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:25,560
Afghanistan is a total and complete 
disaster.

207
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,130
What are we doing?
Get out of Afghanistan.

208
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:33,600
We've wasted billions and billions of 
dollars and more importantly,

209
00:10:33,601 --> 00:10:36,030
thousands and thousands of lives

210
00:10:36,150 --> 00:10:37,790
brands.
Of course in the presidential campaign.

211
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:41,570
He promised he will get the US out of 
Afghanistan if elected.

212
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,520
Well,
now that he's president as well,

213
00:10:43,521 --> 00:10:46,070
things they seem to be rather 
difference.

214
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:51,980
Trump's new position.

215
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:53,480
Okay.

216
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,900
On the 21st of August in the military 
base of four to Meijer in Virginia,

217
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,080
trump explained his brand new strategy 
as well.

218
00:11:00,081 --> 00:11:04,040
Let's just say that everything has been 
saying for years when it came to nothing

219
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,903
trumps new strategy.
It's so similar to a bombers that it's 

220
00:11:06,711 --> 00:11:08,720
really quite difficult to differentiate 
them.

221
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:11,330
Trump announced more troops but not that
many more.

222
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:15,830
Basically the contingents will increase 
from 12,000 to about 16,000 the training

223
00:11:15,831 --> 00:11:16,664
of the Afghan military and the fight 
against terrorism will become a 

224
00:11:18,621 --> 00:11:20,540
priority.
More money will be spent.

225
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:24,170
Corruption will be battles and there 
will be more pressure on Pakistan.

226
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,480
So in other words,
more of the same and nothing that the US

227
00:11:26,570 --> 00:11:27,403
hasn't done before.
The main differences from Obama's 

228
00:11:29,451 --> 00:11:31,520
strategy though are twofold.
First,

229
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,383
there won't be a withdrawal calendar.
I'm second from seems not to be 

230
00:11:35,121 --> 00:11:37,760
interested in building Afghan 
institutions.

231
00:11:37,790 --> 00:11:38,623
In fact,
with the budget cuts on the State 

232
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:42,380
Department's,
trump seems to rely more on arms them on

233
00:11:42,381 --> 00:11:43,214
politics and it's not clear what trump 
tends to do with 16,000 soldiers that 

234
00:11:46,461 --> 00:11:47,294
Obama couldn't do with 140 thousands how
he thinks he can stabilize the country 

235
00:11:50,811 --> 00:11:51,644
without solid and reliable institutions,
which could gain local people's trust 

236
00:11:54,791 --> 00:11:56,560
and allow for some economic development.

237
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:58,660
I mean,
the average age in Afghanistan is around

238
00:11:58,661 --> 00:11:59,494
18 years old,
which is an incredibly young population 

239
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,613
and this youth nowadays can't work.
It doesn't have any future apart from 

240
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:06,424
what the Taliban can offer them.
If qubole or Washington or not able to 

241
00:12:09,011 --> 00:12:11,330
build a framework of opportunities for 
these people,

242
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,140
the end of violence will be very far 
away.

243
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:17,380
So the question must be,
it's Donald Trump aware of this.

244
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:22,460
It's going to be only America first 
America first,

245
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,300
sorry,

246
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:26,133
16 years with an $800 billion in 
thousands and thousands of military and 

247
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:32,350
civilian losses later in the United 
States.

248
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:35,620
It's still bogged down in what many call
the Afghan trap.

249
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,513
And the truth is that trump doesn't seem
to propose anything difference without 

250
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:40,054
institutions.
And with Al's a multilateral 

251
00:12:41,531 --> 00:12:42,364
willingness,
which must include Afghanistan's 

252
00:12:43,781 --> 00:12:44,614
neighbors like China,
it seems very hard to believe that 

253
00:12:46,811 --> 00:12:49,720
weapons are going to be enough.
And now it's your turn.

254
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:52,150
What do you think the US should do in 
Afghanistan?

255
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,013
It's a pretty big question.

Friends at the reconsider media 

259
00:13:01,691 --> 00:13:04,240
podcasts,
they provided the vocals in this episode

260
00:13:04,241 --> 00:13:06,160
that we're not mine and is a ways

261
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:11,110
thank you for watching.
My original instinct was to pull out,

262
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:15,670
and historically,
I like following my instincts,

263
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:16,743
but all my life,
I've heard that decisions are much 

264
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:24,070
different when you sit behind the desk 
in the Oval Office.

265
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:24,993
In other words,
when you're president of the United 

266
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,653
States.
