1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible],

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,620
Venezuelan,
as long game of thrones,

3
00:00:09,621 --> 00:00:12,060
we all want to know how it's going to 
ends,

4
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:12,943
but at the same time we all know that 
we're going to be disappointed with the 

5
00:00:15,171 --> 00:00:18,770
ending and this is exactly what are we 
going to be talking about today.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,720
Many of you have the same question in 
mind.

7
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:22,610
How can the Venezuelan crisis and yeah,

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,533
we are talking about one of the biggest 
financial and humanitarian catastrophes 

9
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:34,603
in modern history in just 10 years 
they've gone from exporting oil to 

10
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,480
exporting refugees,
but you already knew this.

11
00:00:41,481 --> 00:00:45,470
We've got several videos here on visual 
politic that cover this very issue.

12
00:00:45,530 --> 00:00:46,363
Of course,
Venezuela is not the only country that 

13
00:00:47,601 --> 00:00:48,434
has gone completely bankrupt.
You also have the example of Nicaragua 

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:54,600
during the 1980s Nicaragua suffered from
hyperinflation,

15
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:58,400
scarcity of resources and extreme 
poverty as well,

16
00:00:58,401 --> 00:00:59,234
but in that case there was a clear 
alternative to power and it was easy to 

17
00:01:02,811 --> 00:01:04,530
figure out what could happen there.

18
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:13,540
Venezuela instead is a big time mystery.
Think about it.

19
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,990
The Venezuelan president,
Nicolas Maduro is up against the wall.

20
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:17,943
As we said in this video.
He even came up with his own 

21
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:21,283
cryptocurrency,
the petro as a desperate attempt to get 

22
00:01:23,771 --> 00:01:26,380
some foreign currency.
If things keep going this way,

23
00:01:26,381 --> 00:01:28,780
he won't even have the money to pay the 
army.

24
00:01:28,990 --> 00:01:32,680
That keeps them empower.
But this is not the worst problem.

25
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:37,681
The real mystery of oven is wheeler is 
who is the alternative is they're really

26
00:01:38,141 --> 00:01:40,900
somebody who can substitute Maduro's 
rule,

27
00:01:40,901 --> 00:01:41,734
somebody with enough political capital 
to change things in this country and 

28
00:01:45,191 --> 00:01:50,191
it's hard to say.
So far summary,

29
00:01:52,461 --> 00:01:53,294
it is almost impossible to understand is
the current political situation in 

30
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,263
Venezuela.
And then this is why we wanted to talk 

31
00:01:58,461 --> 00:01:59,294
to one of the world's largest experts in
political transitions and you might 

32
00:02:02,421 --> 00:02:03,080
wonder,
well,

33
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:03,913
who are we talking about here in a story
in from a think tank and economist 

34
00:02:07,041 --> 00:02:07,760
maybe?
Well,

35
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,593
we've got someone way better if I'm 
headed up was the finance minister of 

36
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,870
the Czech Republic during the first 
years after the fall of communism.

37
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:23,440
He is one of the architects of the Czech
Republic as it exists today,

38
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:24,453
but this is not the end of the story.
After having a remarkable political 

39
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:30,550
career,
he started a business in South America.

40
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,510
This means he knows this region as well 
as the palm of his hands.

41
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,910
And with that said,
let me introduce you to him.

42
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,410
Hello to all the visual poetic 
subscribers.

43
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,493
All right,
Simon,

44
00:02:40,730 --> 00:02:43,730
it's just impossible to imagine what 
could actually happen in ministry.

45
00:02:50,660 --> 00:02:50,750
But

46
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:55,750
today we are going to draw three 
different or things show scenarios based

47
00:02:56,661 --> 00:02:59,860
on the recent history.
So today's question is what can happen

48
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:00,813
in Venezuela?
What potential scenarios can we foresee 

49
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:05,380
in this country?
We're going to answer these questions,

50
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:08,340
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the history.

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:13,633
Correct

52
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:17,370
way out.
Remember this name [inaudible] Slav.

53
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,273
Javiel few people have had more 
influence on the history of a country 

54
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,590
than him.
He must lizard be achieved.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:30,030
Yeah,
it looks basically the Czech Republic.

56
00:03:30,031 --> 00:03:34,140
We know today the Czech Republic Web,
I happen to live is what it is.

57
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:36,480
Thanks to Vat,
Slav Harwell and believe me,

58
00:03:36,481 --> 00:03:40,170
this is a big success story for a 
democratic transition.

59
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:41,153
While other countries like Russia or 
Ukraine are still poor and unequal 

60
00:03:44,221 --> 00:03:46,500
societies,
the Czech Republic is prosperous,

61
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,140
modern.
And surprisingly egalitarian,

62
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,003
they have low unemployment,
a thriving middle class and it's the 

63
00:03:51,781 --> 00:03:55,860
political rights of any other European 
country that well,

64
00:03:56,010 --> 00:03:56,843
how did they get?

65
00:03:56,910 --> 00:03:57,743
Yeah,

66
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:04,033
until the year 1,989
checks lift the mosquito control 

67
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:11,000
government under the dictatorship of 
good stuff.

68
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:15,920
Gustafason things like going abroad on 
vacation or forbidden or very difficult.

69
00:04:16,190 --> 00:04:17,023
If you wanted to rent a house or flat,
you will need a special permits is with 

70
00:04:21,021 --> 00:04:21,854
achy years.

71
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:23,873
Yeah.

72
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:30,260
Countries like bullet this fine.
Having to communist regime David A.

73
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,093
Little bit more open in effect manage 
checks even though it's trying to cross 

74
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,680
the Polish border so they could buy 
books.

75
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,800
It pigeon in Czechoslovakia.
It's time

76
00:04:39,910 --> 00:04:40,743
nonetheless.
Everything changed at the end of the 

77
00:04:42,521 --> 00:04:43,450
1980s

78
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:44,373
you,
us though we never had the 

79
00:04:44,911 --> 00:04:48,450
hyperinflation to heaven.
Banish valid today.

80
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:51,090
We did suffer scar seats.
Did you want to buy a car?

81
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:54,540
You had to have faith for years onto the
state.

82
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:59,550
Urgh factory would send your basic 
things like bananas but a luxury.

83
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:02,820
It was impossible to find in most of the
shops,

84
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:03,983
maybe with exception of Christmas.
The same happened with most of the 

85
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:11,670
fruits and vegetables,
meats at many different other products

86
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,863
add to this.
The fact that the Soviet Union couldn't 

87
00:05:18,311 --> 00:05:19,144
send money to that allies anymore.
So with no foreign support in the 

88
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,563
bankrupt economy,
it's normal to have all kinds of 

89
00:05:24,851 --> 00:05:26,200
protests.
Of course,

90
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:29,330
that first police suppress the protests 
against hossack.

91
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:29,830
Raul,

92
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,440
of course,
on the first stage,

93
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:35,370
Balistreri brands,
the protest a cane Zulu sat through.

94
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:40,490
But what happens when all of a sudden 
you have more than 250,000

95
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,903
people in the streets of Brac?
You gotta be crazy to start shooting 

96
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:52,310
quarter of million beads.

97
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:53,143
Nicolas Maduro,
the Czechoslovakia and government 

98
00:05:54,831 --> 00:05:55,664
understood that the best thing they 
could do with step down from power in a 

99
00:05:59,181 --> 00:06:00,014
peaceful fashion,
thanks to this Gustaf who sank it got 

100
00:06:01,910 --> 00:06:02,743
his golden retirement and the check 
revolution was known as the velvet 

101
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:08,840
revolution because no blood was spilled.
Nonetheless,

102
00:06:08,841 --> 00:06:09,674
as I said at the beginning,
the key to this process was the 

103
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:15,380
prominent figure of Vaslav Harville.
He was a famous writer back then,

104
00:06:15,381 --> 00:06:18,920
and so he managed to capitalize on all 
of the political unrest.

105
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:22,523
Sure.

106
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:25,320
And love will overcome lies and hate.

107
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,240
True Fuss.
Love Harvard Bachelor.

108
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:29,103
Hello,
we'll slot schooler known before and 

109
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:31,474
with all the tribulation came up,
but he had all the elements to become a 

110
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:35,620
good leader.

111
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,453
The question now is,
is that any Venezuelan vaults love 

112
00:06:38,981 --> 00:06:39,814
Harwell,
maybe somebody we don't know that could 

113
00:06:41,861 --> 00:06:44,740
emerge as a charismatic leader able to 
change everything.

114
00:06:44,890 --> 00:06:45,723
The answer is,
unfortunately that we don't know and 

115
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,143
this is why we should talk about the 
more pessimistic scenario manian way 

116
00:06:56,910 --> 00:06:57,743
out.
What happens when a dictator doesn't 

117
00:06:59,281 --> 00:07:00,114
want to leave power,
even if the situation is getting out of 

118
00:07:02,011 --> 00:07:03,780
hand.
I'm telling you right now,

119
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,150
it's nothing good.
We've said it before here.

120
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:07,950
A visual politic,
despite how it looks,

121
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:11,040
being an authoritarian ruler is a risky 
job.

122
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:14,120
Glass Churches,
school is the best proof of this.

123
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:14,811
You know,
choking.

124
00:07:14,811 --> 00:07:18,230
Get both of them.
The most brutal dictators we ever had.

125
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,450
[inaudible]

126
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,893
I like Nicolas Maduro equal ass jokes.
He didn't even care about pretending to 

127
00:07:38,921 --> 00:07:39,754
organize elections.
It was a system based on the cult of 

128
00:07:42,581 --> 00:07:43,414
personality,

129
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,470
but you know when the economy goes 
south,

130
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:48,830
even Europe's most authoritarians 
dictator has problems.

131
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:50,630
Just like the rest of the communist 
countries.

132
00:07:50,631 --> 00:07:55,280
At the end of the 1980s Romania was at 
the edge of bankruptcy in some regions.

133
00:07:55,281 --> 00:07:58,070
They even had kids with malnutrition.
Nonetheless,

134
00:07:58,071 --> 00:08:01,370
on December the 25th 1989 after giving a
massive speech,

135
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:02,293
the citizens went from clapping their 
hands to booing him in a matter of 

136
00:08:05,331 --> 00:08:06,680
seconds.
Days later,

137
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:11,120
the Romanian equivalent of Kim Jong Uhmm
was executed by his people.

138
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:19,160
Aye.

139
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:32,600
Beyond nuts talking about a revolution 
against the regime.

140
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:35,870
He was not even killed by county 
humanist activists.

141
00:08:35,930 --> 00:08:36,763
In fact,
vouchers school was executed by the 

142
00:08:38,841 --> 00:08:43,210
members of his own party.
It was kind of injuring Gudetama,

143
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,353
the moderate faction of the Romanian 
Communist Party do to control of the 

144
00:08:48,081 --> 00:08:48,950
Romanian government.

145
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,103
In the case of Venezuela,
this good be a faction of his own 

146
00:08:52,601 --> 00:08:54,250
governments or the army.
Of course,

147
00:08:54,251 --> 00:08:56,400
it doesn't have to finish the execution 
of anybody.

148
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:59,370
They could just kick him out of the 
country and you could end up living in a

149
00:08:59,371 --> 00:09:01,620
mansion and any other nation that would 
accept him.

150
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,633
It wouldn't be the first time this has 
happened and it certainly won't be the 

151
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:05,784
last but just like in Romania,
the changes in government would it be 

152
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:12,450
pure lip service,
different faces but at the same values,

153
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,870
the same policies although perhaps a 
little more moderate.

154
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,770
Well at this school year to do these 
Romania,

155
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,903
he's not a special example of the 
transition but at least now we have a 

156
00:09:22,181 --> 00:09:25,930
stable carpentry with some economic 
movement and growth and the reason I was

157
00:09:25,931 --> 00:09:30,870
extreme poverty anymore and there are 
opportunities in the for of future form

158
00:09:37,060 --> 00:09:40,730
and I do now have to make a a serious 
and important decides.

159
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:41,883
I want to be really clear about this.
We're not wishing any personal harm on 

160
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:48,520
Nicolas Maduro or anyone from his 
government here are visual politic.

161
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,910
We would never advocate for any kind of 
violence in this video.

162
00:09:51,911 --> 00:09:56,080
We're simply exploring potential 
scenarios that might or might not happen

163
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,830
based on previous occurrences and that 
really is all that said.

164
00:09:59,890 --> 00:10:03,040
This Romanian way out doesn't seem 
likely to happen either.

165
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:06,400
That is why we will focus on the latest 
possible scenario.

166
00:10:06,401 --> 00:10:07,234
Something that might sound at surreal,
but everything seems to be possible in 

167
00:10:10,961 --> 00:10:11,794
fairness way

168
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:21,310
a country for sale that Chinese way out.
In this other video,

169
00:10:21,311 --> 00:10:25,900
we explained to you why China is the 
only strong ally left of Venezuela.

170
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:26,873
The truth is that China has lens more 
than $60 billion to Madurai as 

171
00:10:30,911 --> 00:10:31,744
governments.
Much of this credit comes in what we 

172
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,084
call oil loans.
There's means China gives money to 

173
00:10:35,951 --> 00:10:38,200
Venezuela and Venezuela instead of 
giving back.

174
00:10:38,201 --> 00:10:42,130
Hard currency gives oil barrels,
and this makes sense,

175
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:44,440
right?
If there was something abundance in this

176
00:10:44,441 --> 00:10:45,274
country,
that would certainly be it's dinosaur 

177
00:10:46,991 --> 00:10:47,950
juice.
In fact,

178
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,810
they have the world's biggest reserves,
so it seems to be a pretty good deal for

179
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,070
the Douro.
Right?

180
00:10:59,590 --> 00:11:00,423
Well,
that is a problem here because as you 

181
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:03,394
know,
the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA has a 

182
00:11:05,741 --> 00:11:06,574
big crisis too.
It is more expensive to drill and 

183
00:11:08,921 --> 00:11:12,430
extract oil in Venezuela than in any 
other country,

184
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,293
including Norway and Canada.
This explains why p Dvsa can no longer 

185
00:11:16,901 --> 00:11:21,901
extract that own resources.
This company is producing of just 43% of

186
00:11:21,941 --> 00:11:25,480
their capacity and it's getting lower 
and lower.

187
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,423
Oh,
many Chinese investors are losing their 

188
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:28,920
patients.
Don't forget,

189
00:11:28,921 --> 00:11:31,860
we are not only talking about 
[inaudible] being government here.

190
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:34,150
There are many private companies 
involved here,

191
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,320
companies that both have an Israeli in 
debt bonds or firms that hidden stake on

192
00:11:39,781 --> 00:11:43,500
of an Israelian industry.
This is why we can find use languages

193
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,353
trying to see no peck,
sue's Venezuela in sign of fraying 

194
00:11:50,911 --> 00:11:52,860
relations.
So the question now,

195
00:11:52,861 --> 00:11:53,694
the real question is what would happen 
in Venezuela if they can't give back 

196
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,770
those Chinese loans?
Well,

197
00:11:59,771 --> 00:12:03,250
a default is unlikely.
China is paying for the military and the

198
00:12:03,251 --> 00:12:07,030
police of Maduro.
This means that at any moment they could

199
00:12:07,031 --> 00:12:10,870
simply shut down the government.
So what could they do instead?

200
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,793
Well,
they could seize pdv essay properties 

201
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:17,460
and these might have viewers are the 
crown jewels of this coming,

202
00:12:17,810 --> 00:12:18,643
trey,

203
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,870
Brian,
you bet.

204
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:24,704
We are saying,
but it is a board of managers could do 

205
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:31,240
the necessary font so the company can go
back to work normally.

206
00:12:31,390 --> 00:12:32,223
Okay?
Today if you DVSA assets are worth $230 

207
00:12:35,350 --> 00:12:36,183
billion,
Maduro owes Xi Jingping more than $60 

208
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:39,851
billion.
In other words,

209
00:12:39,851 --> 00:12:43,570
Beijing could be entitled to seize a 
forth of PTV essays,

210
00:12:43,571 --> 00:12:44,404
assets,
and don't forget that pdv essay is the 

211
00:12:46,091 --> 00:12:48,460
biggest,
if not the only company in Venezuela.

212
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:53,110
Don't forget here that their dinosaur 
juice is 97% of their export,

213
00:12:58,640 --> 00:12:59,473
say only lean.
PDV I say is sort of the same as owning 

214
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:02,810
Venezuela as a whole.

215
00:13:02,890 --> 00:13:03,641
Well,
I didn't bring simple,

216
00:13:03,641 --> 00:13:04,474
Oh,
this would be good for good use for 

217
00:13:05,790 --> 00:13:09,520
veneers,
but it would immobilize because Maduro's

218
00:13:09,521 --> 00:13:10,331
government.
Yeah,

219
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:11,164
the words,
it would be like selling Jehovah 

220
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:15,040
mcconnachie to the Chinese universities.

221
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:21,150
Okay.
All right,

222
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,800
so I know what you're all thinking right
now.

223
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:24,300
You're probably thinking,
come on Simon,

224
00:13:24,301 --> 00:13:26,940
this is science fiction.
It can't actually happen.

225
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,013
Well,
let me tell you that there are already 

226
00:13:29,610 --> 00:13:31,650
signs that something like this could 
happen.

227
00:13:31,830 --> 00:13:34,770
Just look at the news published in Shane
Choir News,

228
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,600
as you probably guessed by the name 
shake.

229
00:13:36,601 --> 00:13:41,250
One News is a Chinese news sites that 
follows Tszujing pings views have a look

230
00:13:41,251 --> 00:13:42,084
at this.

231
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:50,620
Judo creates Venezuela's first petro 
special economic zone.

232
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:54,340
Anytime China wants to do big business 
with a poorer country,

233
00:13:54,341 --> 00:13:57,640
the first thing they do is create a 
special economic zone,

234
00:13:57,641 --> 00:13:58,474
an area with special laws based on 
Chinese regulations and low taxes for 

235
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,060
business.
But in this case,

236
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:04,923
this could even go further.
We're not talking about investing in a 

237
00:14:08,171 --> 00:14:12,260
country or doing business.
We are talking about buying the backbone

238
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:16,060
of the Bolivarian Revolution here.
Without pd Vsa,

239
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,690
Maduro is like a hip hop artist without 
the bling bling chains.

240
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:22,090
So if you can control the economy of the
country,

241
00:14:22,091 --> 00:14:24,130
including the way that it gets its 
finances,

242
00:14:24,250 --> 00:14:27,640
couldn't we say that you've sort of 
already bought it?

243
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,533
Well,
this is what could end up happening in 

244
00:14:29,501 --> 00:14:30,334
Venezuela.
It will be one of the first times in 

245
00:14:31,931 --> 00:14:34,930
history where our whole nation is sold.

246
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:40,600
Perfect.
Again,

247
00:14:42,210 --> 00:14:45,300
this is really hard to conceive,
but as I've already said,

248
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,910
everything is possible in Venezuela,
but now,

249
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:48,773
well it's your 10 which of these three 
scenarios is more to happen or do you 

250
00:14:52,341 --> 00:14:54,890
think we'll see a mixture of all of 
them?

251
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:58,600
These won't leave your answer in the 
comments section below.

252
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:00,930
