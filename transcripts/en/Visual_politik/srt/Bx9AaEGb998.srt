1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible],

2
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,983
the Islamic Republic of Iran.
It's that country that makes these 

3
00:00:11,421 --> 00:00:15,260
independent movies you claim to enjoy 
bits of never actually watched.

4
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:16,153
This country is also well known in a 
rather different regard as being one of 

5
00:00:19,011 --> 00:00:23,120
the United States isn't main enemies as 
well as being something of an antagonist

6
00:00:23,121 --> 00:00:26,120
in Europe and in the democratic world in
general,

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:30,050
Iran is an Islamic theocracy where the 
head of state is not even a politician,

8
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:32,820
but a religious leader.
The Ayatollah Jones,

9
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,860
the legal system is based on sharia law 
and torture and to executions are pretty

10
00:00:41,861 --> 00:00:42,940
common in the country.
Oh,

11
00:00:42,941 --> 00:00:45,600
and just in case that wasn't enough,
the government's also fun.

12
00:00:45,620 --> 00:00:47,670
Several terrorist groups all over the 
world.

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,510
Important bleed.
This one called,

14
00:00:54,470 --> 00:00:57,720
hold on just a second because I mean the
same is true of Saudi Arabia.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:58,890
Nonetheless,
the Saudis,

16
00:00:58,891 --> 00:00:59,724
I'll run a major ally of the United 
States and to have important commercial 

17
00:01:02,731 --> 00:01:04,650
relationships with the rest of the 
world.

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,720
So why is it wrong and seen as bad?
Well,

19
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:10,200
Saudi Arabia is seen as good by some 
western governments.

20
00:01:10,230 --> 00:01:13,350
Many would believe that the answer is a 
pretty simple one.

21
00:01:13,351 --> 00:01:14,184
Then that would be oil,
but the truth is that Iran has the 

22
00:01:16,291 --> 00:01:18,480
fourth biggest oil reserves in the 
world.

23
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:19,413
Well,

24
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:22,763
the,
their crude oil is similar to that in 

25
00:01:23,851 --> 00:01:25,170
Saudi Arabia.
However,

26
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,033
just one year ago they had a band,
meaning that they couldn't sell it to 

27
00:01:29,221 --> 00:01:30,990
most of the world's countries.
Yep.

28
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:31,853
You heard that writes for years,
both America and Europe didn't want to 

29
00:01:33,781 --> 00:01:36,150
buy anything that came from this 
country,

30
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:40,110
so now you might be wondering why is it 
wrong assumption threat to international

31
00:01:40,111 --> 00:01:40,944
security while other countries as 
radical Islam or being better Teresa's 

32
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,560
today.
We're going to answer that question,

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,510
but first let's take a look at the 
history.

34
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,343
Great

35
00:01:58,660 --> 00:01:59,493
thirst is lamach revolution until the 
1970s it Roland was one of the most 

36
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:04,164
glamorous dictatorships in the wells,
the so called sharp from Persia or 

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,070
friends Mohammad Reza Pahlavi rules over
the country with an iron fist.

38
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,250
At the same time he and his wife are on 
diva would go sit the magazine stars and

39
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,900
yes,
I said our friend there because the shah

40
00:02:20,901 --> 00:02:24,820
of Persia was a great ally for the 
United States as well as the free world.

41
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:25,793
Generally,

42
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:28,383
as we said a moment ago,
Iran holds the fourth largest oil 

43
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:31,984
reserves in the world.
Plus they have over 80 million 

44
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,110
inhabitants,
Sandy,

45
00:02:35,111 --> 00:02:38,740
highly educated population when compared
to the neighboring countries.

46
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:39,603
Further there,
ron is a crucial spot for controlling 

47
00:02:41,381 --> 00:02:46,050
the Middle East region.
Nonetheless,

48
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,983
while the Shah was traveling all across 
the world in drawing a lifestyle that 

49
00:02:49,441 --> 00:02:50,274
would make Kanye West look humble,
his country was getting ready for a 

50
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:55,690
revolution and a surname.
I ones out.

51
00:02:55,830 --> 00:03:00,010
What sorts of revolution like this be?
Was it a communist revolution or perhaps

52
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:01,390
it was an Islamic one?
Well,

53
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:04,120
initially the Uranian opposition was 
pretty varied.

54
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:06,070
Unlike Saudi Arabia,
they're wrong,

55
00:03:06,071 --> 00:03:09,790
or as it was known before,
the Persian empire had a long history as

56
00:03:09,791 --> 00:03:10,900
well as a sophisticated

57
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:11,843
hold on.

58
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,840
So among these opposition groups,
you could find pre western liberals,

59
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,760
Marxists,
Social Democrats,

60
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:21,260
and of course,
radical isn't.

61
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:22,094
It assists the latter.
Just handle one indifference and bad to 

62
00:03:25,131 --> 00:03:27,110
the others.
They had a leader,

63
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,590
the Ayatollah Khomeini displaying living
in exile in Paris.

64
00:03:30,591 --> 00:03:33,700
He had great charisma and a reputation 
among via radio,

65
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,483
poop is in Paris.
Kamini addressed all of these things 

66
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:40,983
ellucian raise in Iran,
encouraging them to take power with 

67
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,030
them,
promise of a new and democratic Iran and

68
00:03:46,031 --> 00:03:49,750
Iran were Marxists liberals and isn't it
as could all live together,

69
00:03:49,810 --> 00:03:52,210
and this is how the Islamic Revolution

70
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:53,113
was born.

71
00:03:58,440 --> 00:03:59,273
November of 1979 revolutionary forces 
took over the government palace and the 

72
00:04:02,311 --> 00:04:03,144
u s embassy in Tehran.
This is actually the basis of the movie 

73
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:07,590
argo starring Ben Affleck.
In this movie,

74
00:04:07,591 --> 00:04:08,424
you can see the story of the American 
workers at the embassy being taken 

75
00:04:11,281 --> 00:04:13,650
hostage by the Iranians.
Right afterwards,

76
00:04:13,651 --> 00:04:16,200
the Ayatollah Khomeini would come back 
to his country,

77
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:17,123
supported by all of his believers,
and this is what he said during his 

78
00:04:20,911 --> 00:04:21,840
first speech.

79
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,480
There is no need for an Islamic 
democracy.

80
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,300
It is enough with Islam.
It was of course,

81
00:04:30,301 --> 00:04:34,200
to eliminate the other revolutionary 
groups that it helps them take a power.

82
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:36,870
All of those western liberals,
those Marxists,

83
00:04:36,871 --> 00:04:37,704
those social democrats and even moderate
Muslims were excluded from the new 

84
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,664
Islamic republic as of course,
the country's relationship with the 

85
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:46,530
United States was totally broken.
Well,

86
00:04:46,531 --> 00:04:48,570
actually it was only kinds of broken in 
a way.

87
00:04:48,571 --> 00:04:49,404
We could say there's America and Z.
Iran when from being friends to being 

88
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,450
gets complicated.
Now,

89
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:59,400
on one hand committee hated the u s but 
on the other hand was Ronald Reagan.

90
00:04:59,401 --> 00:05:00,234
The American presidents at the time was 
selling weapons to the Iranians so they 

91
00:05:03,211 --> 00:05:05,650
could fight against them.
Neighboring country rock.

92
00:05:05,740 --> 00:05:07,530
Remember Saddam Hussein?
Well,

93
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:09,590
he was a common enemy for those 
Khomeini,

94
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,453
Dan Duncan,

95
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:11,823
Sandy,

96
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:20,340
1997 the uranians chose a new presidents
Mohammed cut harming,

97
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,280
who tried to restore friendly 
relationships with the US,

98
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,173
but at the same time,
the supreme leader who was not Khomeini 

99
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:28,193
anymore,
but this other one you see on the 

100
00:05:30,031 --> 00:05:32,550
screen,
the Ayatollah Khomeini,

101
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:35,370
who had an evergreen obsession with 
Israel.

102
00:05:35,371 --> 00:05:38,790
So he was funding a terrorist 
organization called [inaudible].

103
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:39,763
Cool.

104
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:42,643
Now,
don't forget that any Rhombi ultimate 

105
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:45,170
decision maker,
this is not the president's,

106
00:05:45,171 --> 00:05:48,440
but this religious leader who holds the 
position of head of state.

107
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,453
The says the American President,
Bill Clinton said he would never the 

108
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,713
friend,
a country that doesn't want Israel to 

109
00:05:54,531 --> 00:05:55,590
exist.
Meanwhile,

110
00:05:55,591 --> 00:05:56,424
the Ron remained.
They divided despite the majority of 

111
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:02,000
their population being okay with a 
radically Islamic leadership.

112
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,180
There is still a big secular movement in
the state.

113
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:09,950
Then in 2005 something happens that 
would change the fate of Iran.

114
00:06:09,951 --> 00:06:10,784
That forever.

115
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:13,500
Huh?

116
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:14,333
With Act Martinia judge,
despite what it looks like between the 

117
00:06:16,481 --> 00:06:19,120
ends of the 1990s and the start of the 
new millennium,

118
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:22,510
Iran had flirted with moderation.
Even secularism,

119
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,373
they even passed a divorce or that 
included separation of goods between 

120
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:27,680
husband and wife.
Not only that,

121
00:06:27,730 --> 00:06:31,720
but by the year 2006 50% of the country 
students were female.

122
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:32,613
Of course,
Iran was still a systemic and be 

123
00:06:33,881 --> 00:06:34,714
violating human rights.
Women were forced to have their heads 

124
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:38,840
covered and religious minorities wet the
bidding.

125
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,250
But don't forget,
we are talking about an Islamic republic

126
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:45,820
in neighboring Saudi Arabia when ons 
even allowed to drive.

127
00:06:45,850 --> 00:06:49,360
But as you can imagine,
this little corner of freedom had not so

128
00:06:49,361 --> 00:06:51,880
many fans on the radical Islamic side of
the SPEC.

129
00:06:51,930 --> 00:06:52,763
Sure.

130
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:54,893
So the Ayatollah Khomeini used all his 
power to radicalize the public opinion 

131
00:06:58,741 --> 00:07:00,420
against the president,
yet they meet.

132
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:04,920
And this is how in 2005 this other guy 
with an impossible to pronounce,

133
00:07:04,921 --> 00:07:09,921
name won the elections would act.
Martinia judge is how a radical accounts

134
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:15,490
or reform process started in Iran 
tortures.

135
00:07:15,491 --> 00:07:18,310
Then detentions increased significantly 
after this year,

136
00:07:18,490 --> 00:07:22,030
at least chase down women who wouldn't 
wear the head job properly and the whole

137
00:07:22,031 --> 00:07:24,400
world was shocked by quotes like this 
one.

138
00:07:24,510 --> 00:07:25,343
Bye Daddy.
You don't want to have the of Hanjin 

139
00:07:26,291 --> 00:07:31,020
spas.
We don't have homosexuals like country.

140
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:33,703
The the ultimate concern for Washington,
it was the Uranian attempt to do build 

141
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,693
their own nuclear bomb.
It's pretty scary to imagine the 

142
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:40,944
possibilities when a government that 
publicly declared their intention to 

143
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:46,740
raise Israel from the map and to use 
president denies the Holocaust,

144
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:47,693
has a new BUBBA,
Iran hates Saudi Arabia and other 

145
00:07:53,291 --> 00:07:56,530
relationships that would be complicated 
by Iran having the bomb.

146
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:00,250
We're actually going to talk more about 
the Iran Saudi Arabia relationship in an

147
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:02,860
upcoming video,
so be sure to subscribe to this channel.

148
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:04,480
Now,
if you don't want to miss that,

149
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,160
and this is the moment when American has
Iran changed their relationship status.

150
00:08:09,161 --> 00:08:09,994
Once again,
this time that went from it's 

151
00:08:11,501 --> 00:08:12,730
complicated to,

152
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:15,950
okay,

153
00:08:15,950 --> 00:08:16,783
dirty council and poses sanctions on 
Iran for failure to holt uranium 

154
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:22,453
enrichment,
the Islamic republic became a real 

155
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:25,814
danger to international stability.
These sanctions were no small thing 

156
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:29,931
either.
Number,

157
00:08:29,931 --> 00:08:32,990
how Iran has the four for larger,
it's crude oil reserves in the wells.

158
00:08:33,170 --> 00:08:34,003
Well,
the economy of Iran unsurprisingly does 

159
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,644
rely on these exports.
So imagine what would happen when the 

160
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:39,884
wealthiest countries in the world just 
stopped buying as since January or 

161
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:46,583
Ramian.
Government figures show the prices of 

162
00:08:48,381 --> 00:08:49,670
bread,
milk,

163
00:08:49,671 --> 00:08:50,504
and meat have risen around 20% well,
the price of chicken has jumped about 

164
00:08:54,620 --> 00:08:55,453
80% since January.
Iranian government figures show the 

165
00:08:58,021 --> 00:08:58,854
prices of bread and milk and meats have 
risen around 20% while the price of 

166
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:05,730
chicken has jumped about 80% but do wait
for just a second because Oh yes,

167
00:09:05,731 --> 00:09:06,564
the best is yet to come.
The economic crisis destroyed our 

168
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:10,043
[inaudible] Janse reputation and his 
successor and current President Hassan 

169
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:14,453
Rouhani came to power under the promise 
of liberal reforms and better 

170
00:09:16,981 --> 00:09:17,814
relationships with the West.
But this is where things started to get 

171
00:09:20,671 --> 00:09:21,610
very interesting.

172
00:09:22,250 --> 00:09:23,083
Okay.

173
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:27,220
The Arab spring,
Iran is a Shia Islamic country.

174
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:30,220
Inside the Muslim world,
Shia Islam is a minority.

175
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,083
This is one of the reasons why the 
Iranian ayatollah is have such a bad 

176
00:09:33,281 --> 00:09:35,550
relationship with the Sunni clergy in 
Saudi.

177
00:09:35,551 --> 00:09:35,690
Right

178
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,523
radio

179
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:45,240
is the reason why Iran is willing to do 
whatever they can to fight dash,

180
00:09:45,241 --> 00:09:46,074
also known as Islamic states.
Bosch is a Sunni Muslim terrorist 

181
00:09:48,871 --> 00:09:50,310
organization.
Add to this.

182
00:09:50,311 --> 00:09:52,950
The fact is that once America removed 
did strips from Iraq,

183
00:09:52,951 --> 00:09:55,350
the Ifo,
Liz funded the new government in Baghdad

184
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,160
and we can explain the following serious
President Bashar Al Assad says,

185
00:09:59,161 --> 00:10:02,880
the Liberation of Aleppo from terrorists
is not only a victory for the mask is,

186
00:10:02,881 --> 00:10:05,760
but also adults who participated in the 
fight against terror,

187
00:10:06,150 --> 00:10:06,983
especially Ron and wash up.
The Iranian army is fighting Islamic 

188
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:11,880
states,
both in Syria and in Iraq.

189
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:15,240
And this is both a help as well as a 
threat to the United States.

190
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:16,313
No one wants to find one radical group 
just for it to be replaced with a more 

191
00:10:18,661 --> 00:10:19,860
radical one.
And yes,

192
00:10:19,861 --> 00:10:22,920
this explains why Obama has an interest 
in building ties with them

193
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:23,853
wrong.

194
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,773
It was a pretty small but your fam 
because he hit two targets with one 

195
00:10:29,061 --> 00:10:29,894
shot.
Now on the one hand is if I'm always 

196
00:10:30,951 --> 00:10:31,784
sending a signal to Saudi Arabia,
he was not willing to help and fight 

197
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,933
dash on that hand,
he is saying whoever defeats the bad 

198
00:10:37,131 --> 00:10:40,340
guys will have a good relationship with 
the u s moreover,

199
00:10:40,430 --> 00:10:41,263
he would finally see it,
an agreement with Iran in order to stop 

200
00:10:43,191 --> 00:10:44,024
their nuclear program.
And this is how they close the famously 

201
00:10:46,521 --> 00:10:47,354
controversial Iranian nuclear deal under
the nuclear deal that we are allies and 

202
00:10:51,501 --> 00:10:54,560
partners reached with Iran last year.
Uh,

203
00:10:54,561 --> 00:10:57,710
Ron will not get a tans on a nuclear 
bomb.

204
00:10:59,120 --> 00:10:59,953
The region,
the United States and the world will be 

205
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:07,001
more secure nonetheless,
Obama success that Donald Trump wants to

206
00:11:08,911 --> 00:11:09,744
stop this diplomatic process,
even though the courts have vetoed his 

207
00:11:12,331 --> 00:11:13,164
infamous Islam ban.
The fact that he included Iran on the 

208
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:17,460
list of countries that cannot get into 
America.

209
00:11:17,490 --> 00:11:20,550
There's a clear signal.
He is slamming the door on Iran.

210
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:23,400
More importantly,
he's showing some love for Saudi Arabia,

211
00:11:23,430 --> 00:11:25,560
but this is something we've covered in 
another video.

212
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,394
And if you want to understand why Donald
Trump is such a good friend of the 

213
00:11:28,411 --> 00:11:30,120
Saudis,
click on this

214
00:11:30,340 --> 00:11:31,173
video.

215
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:36,420
Now,
here is the big question.

216
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:39,780
Cam America restore their relationship 
with Iran.

217
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,770
Is it worth it in order to encourage 
around?

218
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:44,190
Yep.
More moderate and less radical.

219
00:11:44,460 --> 00:11:46,770
