1
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:09,073
European Union,
it's sort of like the windows of 

2
00:00:11,240 --> 00:00:12,073
politics that slow.
It doesn't work perfectly and sometimes 

3
00:00:14,841 --> 00:00:18,050
it just crashes nonetheless.
Let us be honest.

4
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:20,150
The other alternatives are not much 
better.

5
00:00:20,180 --> 00:00:23,990
Ams consistently be more costly at the 
beginning of this year.

6
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:25,940
It seems like the far right was

7
00:00:26,270 --> 00:00:27,103
stackable.

8
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:33,360
Some political analysts claims that 
brexit would be the beginning of the end

9
00:00:33,361 --> 00:00:34,194
for the European Union,
and during this time the international 

10
00:00:36,511 --> 00:00:39,750
media was full of words like frexit or 
checks it out.

11
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,150
Either this year or skeptic fierro 
wasn't a last for long.

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,210
Francis elected a brand new president,
Emmanuel Macron,

13
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,630
who stands up for the European Union 
like no one else.

14
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:53,430
The same has happened in other elections
around Europe.

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,353
In other words,
the European Union is alive and kicking 

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,400
at least for the next four years,
but to do,

17
00:00:59,401 --> 00:01:00,234
hold on for just a minute because things
are more complex than what they might 

18
00:01:02,371 --> 00:01:03,420
seem.
In fact,

19
00:01:03,450 --> 00:01:06,420
norms.
All EU fans are the same as many of them

20
00:01:06,421 --> 00:01:09,660
don't even share the same opinion on 
what the EU should be.

21
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:10,733
For instance,
the Crohn's stands for a fiscal union 

22
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:17,481
with the same taxes in every country.
Geneva,

23
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,820
Angela Merkel,
nausea into that.

24
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,480
On the other hands that you formed the 
Belgium Prime Minister Abe Verhofstadt,

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:28,540
who is now president of the European 
Liberal Party,

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,740
says that Europe should become a 
federation like the United States.

27
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,710
Does everyone agree with that?
Well,

28
00:01:35,711 --> 00:01:38,830
the answer is rather unsurprisingly,
no.

29
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:39,873
In fact,
the only thing shared by all these 

30
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:44,670
politicians is the fact that the EU is a
good thing,

31
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,190
but now the questions are,
well,

32
00:01:48,191 --> 00:01:51,400
what is the European Union all about?
What should it become?

33
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,950
Is it a federation or a confederation?
Ends?

34
00:01:53,951 --> 00:01:56,650
What are the different models on the 
negotiation table?

35
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,723
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

36
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:04,321
these questions.
Margaret Thatcher was right.

37
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:10,753
Margaret township is something like 
Elvis Presley to euro skeptics for 

38
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:14,684
decades.
This woman who was the British prime 

39
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:16,604
minister in the 19 eighties has it 
become the biggest inspiration for many 

40
00:02:19,401 --> 00:02:22,130
of the movements that want to end the 
European project,

41
00:02:25,370 --> 00:02:28,250
but then again,
reality is seldom simple.

42
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:29,233
Now,
it is true that Margaret Thatcher was a 

43
00:02:30,801 --> 00:02:31,634
big critic of political integration back
in the time the European Union still 

44
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:35,654
didn't exist.
There was just a community of countries 

45
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:39,680
that traded among themselves.
Nevertheless,

46
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,800
during the 19 eighties,
different European governments agreed to

47
00:02:42,830 --> 00:02:43,663
deepen this interview.

48
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:47,130
Gracious is

49
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:50,910
when they started talking about a single
currency and you institutions.

50
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:55,110
All of this culminated in 1992 with the 
signing of the master x treaty,

51
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,003
but the question is,
what's it Margaret Thatcher think about 

52
00:02:57,481 --> 00:02:58,291
all of this?
Well,

53
00:02:58,291 --> 00:02:59,124
the truth is if we forget about 
stereotypes and we actually read her 

54
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:03,850
memoir,
we find quotes like this,

55
00:03:06,650 --> 00:03:10,900
just not dream of some cozy,
isolated existence on the fringes of the

56
00:03:10,901 --> 00:03:14,400
European community.
Our destiny is in Europe as part of the

57
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,633
importantly.
This doesn't mean that that shit was in 

58
00:03:19,911 --> 00:03:23,000
total agreements with all the European 
politicians.

59
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:23,983
She just wanted a different model.
Unlike Lucy wanted to United States of 

60
00:03:27,501 --> 00:03:30,860
Europe with the capital of Brussels,
she stood for a confederate.

61
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:33,110
Certainly

62
00:03:33,110 --> 00:03:37,130
we want to see Europe more united and 
with a greater sense of common purpose,

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,460
but it must be in a way which preserves 
the different traditions,

64
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:45,730
parliamentary powers and sense of 
national pride in one's home going,

65
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,763
we've got to explain what's the 
difference between a federation and a 

66
00:03:52,141 --> 00:03:52,974
confederation.
An example of a federation would be the 

67
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,413
United States of America,
Texas and California have their own 

68
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:02,334
legislatures,
their own governments and their own 

69
00:04:03,751 --> 00:04:04,710
laws.
Today,

70
00:04:04,711 --> 00:04:07,530
for instance,
marijuana is legal in California,

71
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,600
but illegal in Texas.
However,

72
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,493
if the congress in Washington DC were to
pass a law legalizing cannabis across 

73
00:04:14,101 --> 00:04:14,934
the country,
any state law that would contradict the 

74
00:04:16,801 --> 00:04:18,430
federal one would be automatic.

75
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:22,460
We abolished in the confederation that 
states have way more autonomy today.

76
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,030
There are actually no confederations in 
the world,

77
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,010
not even in Switzerland.
Of course,

78
00:04:27,011 --> 00:04:27,844
in Switzerland,
the different kansans enjoy a loss of 

79
00:04:29,501 --> 00:04:30,334
autonomy and different taxes,
but that doesn't mean they are a 

80
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:34,180
confederation.
For instance,

81
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,390
if the parliaments of burner would pass 
a law legalizing marijuana,

82
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:39,690
the rest of the cousins would have to 
accept

83
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:40,723
yes.

84
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:45,443
Switzerland was a real confederation.
Each of the different assemblies would 

85
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,470
have to have a vote to decide whether 
they want to keep cannabis legal or not.

86
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:53,423
So despite what a lot of people say,
Switzerland is clearly a federation and 

87
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,990
so now you might be wondering,
well,

88
00:04:57,991 --> 00:05:01,620
what exactly is a Europe then?
Is it a federation or a confederation?

89
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,800
Of course there are lots of people who 
stand for the federal model.

90
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:05,693
In the last few years,
the champion of this idea has been the 

91
00:05:07,531 --> 00:05:12,120
president of the Liberals Diva hotstats 
that we need to be formed Europe to make

92
00:05:12,121 --> 00:05:17,121
it a real federation capable to act not 
only on in the economic field,

93
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:19,463
but also by establishing the defense 
union by establishing a European 

94
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:27,120
investigation capacity.
But let's go back to the facts today.

95
00:05:27,150 --> 00:05:27,983
Despite what it looks like,
national governments have a lot of 

96
00:05:30,571 --> 00:05:31,860
autonomy.
For instance,

97
00:05:31,861 --> 00:05:32,910
years ago,
Brussels,

98
00:05:32,911 --> 00:05:35,550
past the directive,
banning smoking in bars.

99
00:05:35,670 --> 00:05:36,503
After that,
each of the member countries have to 

100
00:05:37,801 --> 00:05:40,790
vote on their own anti tobacco law,
men's well,

101
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,000
you know what happens?
Well,

102
00:05:42,001 --> 00:05:45,240
Australia and the Czech Republic did not
pass those laws,

103
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:46,074
and during those years you could smoke 
in the cafes of Prague and Vienna Wall 

104
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:51,380
in Berlin and Paris.
It was completely forbidden.

105
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,253
Vat,
which is the main European tax is 

106
00:06:00,701 --> 00:06:03,550
different in each country.
In Spain they a 21 percent,

107
00:06:03,551 --> 00:06:05,680
but in hungry they paid 27 percent 
times.

108
00:06:05,681 --> 00:06:08,860
In Germany they've got a 19 percent tax.
In other words,

109
00:06:08,861 --> 00:06:09,694
Europe is not a federation,
but it's also not a confederation 

110
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,790
either.
It's kind of a federal confederation and

111
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:16,624
now you're probably wondering,
is this federal confederation model 

112
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:22,750
actually working or do we need to move 
ahead with some sort of United States of

113
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:23,584
Europe

114
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,163
wrong in the European Union?
We all have heard about the many 

115
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:31,340
mistakes this European integration has 
made,

116
00:06:31,341 --> 00:06:35,090
but the truth is many of these floors 
could have happened in the member states

117
00:06:35,091 --> 00:06:36,830
individually.
As an example.

118
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,660
Let us have a look at the refugee 
crisis.

119
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,583
Now.
It is true that Brussels was incapable 

120
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:41,713
of crafting a common policy to give 
asylum to all the citizens that are 

121
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:47,420
running away from countries like Syria,
Iraq or Libya.

122
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:48,313
But let's not lie to ourselves.
The same happens in every single 

123
00:06:51,351 --> 00:06:52,730
country.
In Spain,

124
00:06:52,731 --> 00:06:53,564
for example,
the national government did everything 

125
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:58,060
they could to avoid welcoming the 
refugees on the other hands.

126
00:06:58,070 --> 00:06:58,903
Madrid city hall did the exact opposite.
City Hall of Madrid will make a 

127
00:07:05,631 --> 00:07:08,900
welcoming project so the refugees will 
have a place to live.

128
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,873
In other words,
we cannot expect to Brussels to solve 

129
00:07:11,601 --> 00:07:15,050
the problems that nation states have 
always had in politics.

130
00:07:15,051 --> 00:07:16,850
Such things.
They're simply not possible.

131
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,960
But do you hold on for a moment because 
this does not mean the European Union is

132
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:22,400
perfect either.
In fact,

133
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:25,280
there are many problems that are endemic
to this incident.

134
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:29,493
For example,
let's imagine you are a freelance and 

135
00:07:30,621 --> 00:07:33,610
living in Hungary and you work for a 
company based in Belgium.

136
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,940
Should you include Vat on the invoice 
that you said to them?

137
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,710
Well,
according to EU legislation,

138
00:07:38,711 --> 00:07:40,960
you shouldn't because while it's a 
service contract,

139
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:41,943
but each country has its own tax laws 
that in many cases contradicts the EU 

140
00:07:45,641 --> 00:07:47,440
laws.
But not only that,

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:50,020
what Vat should you include on that 
invoice?

142
00:07:50,021 --> 00:07:52,030
The Hungarian one more.
The Belgium one.

143
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:52,933
All these problems.
Could be solved if there was a common 

144
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:55,894
ground on taxation matters.
Let's many countries don't want to lose 

145
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:02,760
sovereignty on this matter and no one 
does make the first step towards.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,780
So as you might imagine from this,
it's pretty hard for important decisions

147
00:08:09,781 --> 00:08:12,210
to move forward.
So the question is,

148
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,103
what could be the solution to this 
problem club with different kinds of 

149
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:21,630
members?
Constitution,

150
00:08:21,700 --> 00:08:22,533
they are useful.
They allow politicians and legislators 

151
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:27,550
to know what they can do and what they 
can't.

152
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,593
It's sort of like a minimal agreements 
this way a government knows what it can 

153
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:35,320
pass as a law and it's a system that has
been proven effective

154
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:38,520
so

155
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,480
well.
What's the problem?

156
00:08:39,660 --> 00:08:40,493
Well,
old attempts to release a European 

157
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:42,504
constitution have failed in 2005.
Both France and the Netherlands had 

158
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:46,734
referendums where they rejected the 
proposal for a European magna Carta 

159
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,020
years later,
Brussels politicians,

160
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,390
matt again to write a new version of 
this constitution,

161
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:55,253
these so called Lisbon Treaty.
This was a milder version of the 

162
00:08:58,081 --> 00:09:02,370
previously drafted constitution.
That's integration problems persisted,

163
00:09:02,430 --> 00:09:03,263
but truth is that each country has its 
own interests and it's hard to get them 

164
00:09:06,211 --> 00:09:07,044
all on the same page,
so why not just recognize the 

165
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:10,254
differences,
and this is why the European Commission 

166
00:09:12,271 --> 00:09:13,104
has made the European Whitesburg where 
they imagined by you've potential 

167
00:09:16,141 --> 00:09:16,974
scenarios for you.
One of them would allow each state to 

168
00:09:22,741 --> 00:09:24,570
have a different level of integration.

169
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,000
On the other hand,
at the beginning of 2017,

170
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,863
the economist proposed to create a 
European Union with different kinds of 

171
00:09:31,351 --> 00:09:32,184
memberships of one hand,
there would be a premium member who 

172
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,574
would share a common currency,
common fiscal policy and a common 

173
00:09:38,281 --> 00:09:39,840
foreign policy.
On another one,

174
00:09:39,900 --> 00:09:40,733
there would be a silver member would 
just share a common market and the free 

175
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:44,550
movement area.
Other members,

176
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:47,750
let's call them the bronze category,
would have access to just the comment

177
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,603
market.

178
00:09:49,490 --> 00:09:52,190
This way,
it would be way easier to convince every

179
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:54,530
country to pass a European constitution.

180
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:57,180
In the meantime,
the idea of a United States of Europe,

181
00:09:57,181 --> 00:09:58,014
it's lost a lot of support supporters.
The idea of a Europe with different 

182
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:01,230
membership levels,
however,

183
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:06,000
currently enjoys a lot of stuff.
Meanwhile,

184
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:06,863
Francis brand new president is willing 
to play a major role in the future of 

185
00:10:09,781 --> 00:10:12,090
Europe,
but what does he really stands for?

186
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,800
Well,
we're not answering that in this video,

187
00:10:13,801 --> 00:10:15,930
but if you'd like to know more about 
Emmanuel Macron,

188
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:18,670
don't forget to check out this video 
that we need.

189
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:21,943
So now our question to you is,
do you think this hybrid of a federal 

190
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,070
confederation with different men,
but categories can actually work?

191
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:29,053
Or should we keep trying?
For a federation where everyone has the 

192
00:10:31,251 --> 00:10:32,084
same rules,
please do let us know what you think in 

193
