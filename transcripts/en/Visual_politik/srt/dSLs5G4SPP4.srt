1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,063
often people think that Switzerland's 
wealth comes only because of their 

3
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:13,320
status as a fiscal haven.
But think about it.

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:15,420
There are other countries like Panama,
Cypress,

5
00:00:15,421 --> 00:00:19,320
the Republic of Liberia,
these all fiscal haven's too,

6
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:23,250
don't forget Africa,
not 70 offers low taxes to international

7
00:00:23,251 --> 00:00:24,084
companies,
but it also offers them Pasadena 

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:26,540
passage.
Let's still,

9
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,650
these countries remained low income 
countries.

10
00:00:28,651 --> 00:00:33,090
While Switzerland's remains one of the 
wealthiest countries in the world,

11
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,860
and all of this comes with them having 
no natural resources not compromising on

12
00:00:37,861 --> 00:00:39,450
democracy or human rights.

13
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,700
[inaudible]

14
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:43,713
Switzerland has one of the most 
egalitarian political systems in the 

15
00:00:46,451 --> 00:00:47,284
world,
and its welfare system is as good as 

16
00:00:48,821 --> 00:00:50,560
that of Norway,
Denmark.

17
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,090
Additionally,
their citizens,

18
00:00:52,091 --> 00:00:54,730
and not only have the right to vote 
every four years,

19
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:57,100
but every four months,
this was,

20
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:57,963
don't just choose their leaders,
that they choose their policies with 

21
00:01:00,011 --> 00:01:02,680
referendums happening several times a 
year,

22
00:01:02,770 --> 00:01:05,560
Switzerland has one of the world's best 
political systems,

23
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:09,160
and we believe that this is the reason 
that they are successful.

24
00:01:09,370 --> 00:01:11,530
In fact,
we think that the Swiss system should be

25
00:01:11,531 --> 00:01:12,364
a model for other countries.
And in this video we're going to tell 

26
00:01:14,231 --> 00:01:15,064
you why.

27
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:17,540
[inaudible]

28
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:19,543
reason number one,
the centralization from a practical 

29
00:01:23,091 --> 00:01:23,924
point of view,
it's Switzerland is what is known as a 

30
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:27,290
confederation.
In fact,

31
00:01:27,291 --> 00:01:30,230
it's the only confederation that exists 
on the planet.

32
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,100
It is made up of 26 states which are 
cold cantons.

33
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:35,083
The only thing that these cans,
all those have in common are a 

34
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:39,590
constitution,
foreign policy and the currency.

35
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:40,573
Aside from that,
if they are totally different from one 

36
00:01:42,501 --> 00:01:44,210
another,
let's look at an example.

37
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:48,170
Let's say you make a salary of 6,000 
Swiss franc spend.

38
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:50,030
You live in the region,
all the Jura.

39
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:51,073
In that case,
you're going to pay income tax of 14% 

40
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,853
but if you made the same amounts of 
money and you live in the region of 

41
00:01:56,850 --> 00:01:57,683
Zuellig,
your income tax is only going to be 4% 

42
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:07,430
look at a different example.
If you have a shop in Geneva,

43
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:12,230
then you're going to have to close your 
shop at 6:00 PM but if you own a shop in

44
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,064
Zurich,
you're free to keep your shop open for 

45
00:02:14,361 --> 00:02:15,194
as many hours as you want.
Because of this system that comes on is 

46
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:18,824
can adjust the laws,
the peculiarities of each individual 

47
00:02:21,621 --> 00:02:22,454
territory ans what is even more 
important than this is that they can 

48
00:02:26,781 --> 00:02:27,890
compete with each other.

49
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:31,950
This

50
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:35,100
explains why in general,
the councils have assumption,

51
00:02:35,101 --> 00:02:39,420
no taxation,
but our story doesn't end here.

52
00:02:39,630 --> 00:02:44,190
Switzerland is so decentralized that 
they have four official languages,

53
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:45,240
German,
French,

54
00:02:45,241 --> 00:02:46,680
Italian,
and relaunch.

55
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:48,750
This means that if you happen to go to 
Geneva,

56
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:49,584
which is a French speaking part,
you're not getting to hear anyone 

57
00:02:52,021 --> 00:02:53,850
speaking German,
the billboards,

58
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:55,710
the road signs,
the local newspapers,

59
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,603
everything is in French.
The same goes for Zurich with Jen and 

60
00:02:59,831 --> 00:03:01,360
all the Ghana with Italian

61
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,450
[inaudible].

62
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,190
Number two,
Switzerland has no precedent.

63
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,940
Every country has a head of governments 
who is responsible for certain things,

64
00:03:12,941 --> 00:03:14,080
right?
Well,

65
00:03:14,081 --> 00:03:15,420
no,
not switzer matters,

66
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:16,263
but don't get me wrong,
they're not living in anarchy or 

67
00:03:17,831 --> 00:03:19,810
anything.
This is what they do.

68
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:20,853
Is they vote for a federal parliaments,
which is similar to Congress in the 

69
00:03:23,831 --> 00:03:24,664
United States of America.
This parliaments and then chooses seven 

70
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:31,030
people who are going to become something
like ministers or secretaries.

71
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:34,380
All of these people have the same amount
of

72
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:35,363
power.

73
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:39,173
Yeah.
One of them takes a turn becoming 

74
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:42,980
Switzerland's international 
representative.

75
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,430
It's technically this person is the 
president of Switzerland,

76
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:48,830
but they haven't no specific powers.
Uber,

77
00:03:48,831 --> 00:03:52,550
the other six people and as I said,
they routine this person.

78
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,693
Yeah.
This is an important difference in the 

79
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,414
Swiss mentality because in other 
countries the president isn't really 

80
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,420
powerful.
Passive bought in Switzerland.

81
00:04:01,421 --> 00:04:05,980
It's just a symbolic thing because all 
of the decision making is done by a team

82
00:04:06,140 --> 00:04:07,480
[inaudible]

83
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:13,730
or three direct democracy.
This is the most important part of Swiss

84
00:04:13,731 --> 00:04:15,910
politics.
They're referendums.

85
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,053
In fact,
most of it,

86
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,520
that law was a chosen by a popular vote.
Some at the federal level,

87
00:04:20,521 --> 00:04:21,354
some of the canned tonia level.
The proposal for a referendum only 

88
00:04:23,761 --> 00:04:24,594
requires 50,000 signatures.
While one if it's going to amend the 

89
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:30,510
constitution requires 100 thousands now,
don't get me wrong.

90
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:33,810
Other countries do allow their 
populations to have referendums.

91
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:34,980
For example,
in Spain,

92
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:35,843
this is totally possible,
but a referendum proposal requires 

93
00:04:38,131 --> 00:04:42,850
500,000 signatures and they can't do any
referendums that will change the culture

94
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,830
tuition because of this

95
00:04:45,940 --> 00:04:46,773
system.
Switzerland's holds several referendums 

96
00:04:48,701 --> 00:04:49,534
every single year,
every four months this waste go to the 

97
00:04:51,731 --> 00:04:55,450
polling station and they will vote on 
any proposals that have been put forward

98
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:57,610
in the previous four months.
Now,

99
00:04:57,611 --> 00:04:58,444
let's look at an example of one of these
referendums from the year 2015 if they 

100
00:05:02,501 --> 00:05:03,334
have to choose whether they wanted to 
create a basic income for every Swiss 

101
00:05:06,071 --> 00:05:07,390
citizen.
They said no.

102
00:05:07,391 --> 00:05:08,224
By the way,
they also had to decide on some 

103
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:13,540
amendments to the assisted reproduction 
acts and they also about to vote on some

104
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:16,360
doors related to public transport.
Interestingly,

105
00:05:16,470 --> 00:05:16,820
these,
yeah,

106
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,920
Paul's awesome having really big 
turnout.

107
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:23,990
60% of Swiss people for this 2015 
referendum when to the polls

108
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,710
[inaudible] some number

109
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:28,543
for free markets.
Some of you might think that it's very 

110
00:05:30,651 --> 00:05:35,600
easy for a populist anticapitalist 
leader to emerge in a system like this,

111
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:36,523
but make no mistake Switzerland is to 
the free markets like France is to it's 

112
00:05:41,301 --> 00:05:42,560
wine.
Don't forget,

113
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:46,250
this country is isolated in the 
mountains and has practically no farming

114
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:48,530
land.
This means that it's have to sign a free

115
00:05:48,531 --> 00:05:51,390
trade agreements with pretty much every 
country on it.

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,180
Well,
it's hold on my deal.

117
00:05:53,181 --> 00:05:55,540
Libertarian friends who are watching 
this video,

118
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,550
hold on for just second.
Yes,

119
00:05:58,551 --> 00:06:02,210
it is true that Switzerland is a 
commerce loving nation.

120
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:05,160
No more so than the European Union.

121
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,790
[inaudible].

122
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,303
This is the Swiss actually subsidize 
that agriculture as much as the 

123
00:06:11,921 --> 00:06:12,754
Europeans or the Americans do and they 
also participate in the same trade 

124
00:06:16,091 --> 00:06:18,640
embargoes that exist with Iran and 
Russia.

125
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:23,680
The only differences that Switzerland 
has embraced free trade since 1874 while

126
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,514
the rest of the world's is only been 
doing it for the last few decades and 

127
00:06:27,251 --> 00:06:29,830
now there is another very important 
difference about Switzerland,

128
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,743
but we must get into,
and it's probably one that you've heard 

129
00:06:33,401 --> 00:06:38,401
about recent number five Swiss,
no tragedy.

130
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,500
Switzerland is one of the few neutral 
countries in the world.

131
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:47,040
This means that they won't participate 
in any arms conflict.

132
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:47,933
They even stayed out of world water you 
despite the fact that most of the 

133
00:06:50,341 --> 00:06:52,830
population was against Hitler.
Thanks to this,

134
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:53,723
Switzerland has never been reconstructed
while the rest of Europe ripped itself 

135
00:06:57,061 --> 00:06:57,894
apart,
killing millions and then spending 

136
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:00,084
billions in reconstruction.
Switzerland didn't and they used all of 

137
00:07:03,901 --> 00:07:07,770
those savings to improve that system.
As we all know,

138
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:10,990
the number one enemy of economic 
progress is

139
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,483
Switzerland does have a military.
The thing is this army is entirely 

140
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:23,420
defensive and they will only use it to 
propel external attacks.

141
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:27,470
They will never use it to find it in 
anything outside of self defense,

142
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:31,070
and this is where we see one of the few 
drawbacks of the Swiss system.

143
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,233
They're military or should we say them 
initia every Swiss citizen must do 

144
00:07:35,991 --> 00:07:36,824
military service from the age of 18 to 
the age of 30 spending one month every 

145
00:07:40,971 --> 00:07:45,490
single year serving in the military and 
even after that service period they miss

146
00:07:45,491 --> 00:07:46,324
still keep a gun at home.
Of course it Switzerland's isn't the 

147
00:07:48,651 --> 00:07:51,170
only country that does this with Norway 
and Israel.

148
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:53,160
Also having mandatory military sentence.

149
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:01,030
People argue that this system is good 
with pundits saying that it creates more

150
00:08:01,031 --> 00:08:04,060
entrepreneurs and creates less income 
disparity.

151
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:06,370
Don't forget that during that time in 
the military,

152
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:11,320
the rich and the poor on mixing together
several startups and companies have been

153
00:08:11,321 --> 00:08:12,154
created from relationships that were 
formed while people were serving in the 

154
00:08:14,891 --> 00:08:15,724
military.
But the big question is what about 

155
00:08:17,081 --> 00:08:19,300
liberty?
What about the freedom to choose?

156
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,134
What gives the government the right to 
force you to work in a place that you 

157
00:08:23,141 --> 00:08:23,974
might not want to work?
Of course we don't have the answers to 

158
00:08:26,531 --> 00:08:27,364
these questions,
but they are just something for you to 

159
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:29,350
ponder.

160
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:32,570
Yeah.
Number

161
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,300
six,
ease of doing business.

162
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:37,530
Finally,
inventing is perhaps the most well known

163
00:08:37,531 --> 00:08:40,970
to thing about Switzerland am's.
That is that taxes.

164
00:08:41,030 --> 00:08:44,150
It's true despite the differences from 
one council to another,

165
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:47,090
Switzerland does typically have very low
taxation.

166
00:08:47,540 --> 00:08:48,373
Further the laws to start a company.
I'll a fairly simple and anyone can see 

167
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:52,730
those laws buying.
Just giving online.

168
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:56,040
Switzerland is one of the most 
transparent freeze in the world.

169
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,143
This is encouraged a lots of 
international companies to establish 

170
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,144
their fiscal residents in Switzerland,
but it also makes it very easy for 

171
00:09:02,971 --> 00:09:06,510
people in Switzerland to set up their 
company and yes.

172
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,231
Okay,
okay.

173
00:09:07,231 --> 00:09:09,990
Banks do make up a large part of the 
Swiss economy,

174
00:09:09,991 --> 00:09:11,930
but it's probably not as big as you.

175
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:15,510
Yeah.

176
00:09:15,510 --> 00:09:16,121
Oh,
many,

177
00:09:16,121 --> 00:09:16,954
many other industries in Switzerland.
It doesn't mean logitech mean anything 

178
00:09:20,231 --> 00:09:20,860
to you.
Well,

179
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,320
look at your mouse.
Look at your Webcam.

180
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:24,940
You'll probably see it printed on one of
those things.

181
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,893
And this is a company that was formed in
Switzerland and then there's the 

182
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:31,390
pharmaceuticals to the names,
Novartis or Hoffman Laroche Ring.

183
00:09:31,391 --> 00:09:32,770
Any bells?
Not to mention,

184
00:09:32,771 --> 00:09:33,820
of course,
tourism,

185
00:09:33,821 --> 00:09:36,340
precision machinery.
I'm that famous swaptions.

186
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,263
I'm pretty sure you could mean five 
companies that are from Switzerland are 

187
00:09:39,851 --> 00:09:42,390
simply buying meanings and expensive 
watch brands.

188
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:46,060
Ooh.

189
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:50,500
This is being done in a country with a 
population that is smaller than New York

190
00:09:50,501 --> 00:09:51,820
City.
As we always say,

191
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:52,683
visual politic.
It is not a country's natural resources 

192
00:09:54,701 --> 00:09:55,534
and it is not luck.
The determine whether they are 

193
00:09:57,371 --> 00:09:58,204
successful.
It's their system of government and the 

194
00:10:00,371 --> 00:10:04,450
institutions that do this.
And we believe that the Swiss have a lot

195
00:10:04,451 --> 00:10:06,760
to teach the rest of the world in this 
regard.

196
00:10:09,470 --> 00:10:11,360
Just our opinion.
Do you agree with us?

197
00:10:11,361 --> 00:10:12,194
Do you disagree with us at?
Do you think that your country could 

198
00:10:14,361 --> 00:10:17,110
benefit from a system more in length,
the Swiss?

199
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,003
Well,
