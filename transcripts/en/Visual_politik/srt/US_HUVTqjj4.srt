1
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:09,023
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:10,163
we may not like it,
but we can't see that corruption in 

3
00:00:11,701 --> 00:00:14,550
Argentina bans in most countries.
Is anything new?

4
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:15,443
The truth is that since the first 
government meeting back in 1810 

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:22,080
virtually no Argentine government has 
been free of suspicion.

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:27,460
Yup.

7
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:31,180
Possibilities are almost endless and the
incentives are very,

8
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:32,043
very generous.
I don't think it's just a matter of 

9
00:00:33,641 --> 00:00:37,480
sticking your hands in and your done 
because most corruption cases,

10
00:00:37,540 --> 00:00:40,420
they're far more convoluted than this.
However,

11
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:43,720
what has been uncovered in recent years,
it does go much,

12
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,240
much further.
We're talking about the realization that

13
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:47,074
in Argentina there has been a systematic
process led by the nation's own 

14
00:00:50,291 --> 00:00:51,124
government with the object of looting,
the country's public treasury on a far 

15
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:55,563
larger scale,
and we don't talking about the 

16
00:01:00,471 --> 00:01:01,304
occasional bribe,
but billions of dollars that given the 

17
00:01:03,261 --> 00:01:06,650
evidence seemed to have been stolen 
during the Peronist governments of Nesta

18
00:01:06,651 --> 00:01:08,880
catch now and Cristina Fernandez de 
coach.

19
00:01:08,881 --> 00:01:12,950
Now,
more news comes almost daily,

20
00:01:12,951 --> 00:01:15,680
but the goal of this video is to tell 
you how it all started,

21
00:01:15,740 --> 00:01:20,240
what happens and how this plot worked.
A plots which the very presidency of the

22
00:01:20,241 --> 00:01:23,480
republic was involved in,
as well as dozens of politicians,

23
00:01:23,510 --> 00:01:24,710
judges,
officials,

24
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,320
and as many of the most important 
businessmen in the country.

25
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:31,543
This looting operations plus known as 
the notebooks began with the arrival of 

26
00:01:34,911 --> 00:01:35,744
Nesta coachnet in May of 2003 and 
continued under the presidency of his 

27
00:01:38,871 --> 00:01:39,704
wife Cristina Fernandez.
The catch now until 2015 that is to say 

28
00:01:43,071 --> 00:01:46,880
the systematic pillaging of the public 
coffers happens for more than a decade.

29
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:47,773
Now.
Before we look into what this consisted 

30
00:01:48,951 --> 00:01:51,470
of and how much money it meant for the 
origin times,

31
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:56,210
we have to answer some questions about 
the real protagonists of this story,

32
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:58,160
the consciousness we need to look at who
they are,

33
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,040
how they got into power,
and how have they managed to set up what

34
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:01,874
is perhaps the biggest operation in the 
history of stealing from Argentina's 

35
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:06,710
public coffers.
So listen up.

36
00:02:12,380 --> 00:02:13,213
Okay.

37
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,773
Kerschner is a sentence,
provincial politicians who managed to 

38
00:02:21,761 --> 00:02:22,594
own Argentina for years,
so it all began with a beautiful love 

39
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,940
story between two young university 
students,

40
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:30,063
Nesta.
I'm Christina Matt in the mid seventies 

41
00:02:31,571 --> 00:02:35,110
while studying at the National 
University of La Plaza in Buenos Aires,

42
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,003
love as soon blooms and in 1976 after 
the military coup led by left Tenant 

43
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,413
General Jorge at Rafael v dealer or two 
lovers decided to leave and work as 

44
00:02:44,231 --> 00:02:48,250
lawyers in the city of Rio gay golf's in
the province of Santa Cruz,

45
00:02:48,340 --> 00:02:49,173
a city Bonnie,
of the way that is far away from the 

46
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:51,911
capitol.
Indeed,

47
00:02:51,911 --> 00:02:54,730
it's more than 2,650 kilometers away.

48
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:56,450
Okay.
If

49
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:59,650
we had been asked about that couples 
particular future at that time,

50
00:02:59,651 --> 00:03:03,130
we probably wouldn't have mentioned 
anything about national politics.

51
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,993
However,
after democracy returned in 1983 this 

52
00:03:06,041 --> 00:03:06,874
nice lawyer couple joins the Peronist 
party and it was their folks that the 

53
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,050
career of those who became Argentina's 
underwood's ready began.

54
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:15,250
Well,
now that we actually think about it,

55
00:03:15,251 --> 00:03:16,084
it was probably the underwoods who 
became the consciousness of the 

56
00:03:18,251 --> 00:03:19,084
political series.
It was a relationship made by and four 

57
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:26,030
power first in 1987 Nesta catch no was 
elected mayor of Rio de.

58
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:30,730
I'll send a few years later in 1991 
governor of the province of Santa Cruz.

59
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:31,593
Then finally in 2003 he became president
of the Republic of Argentina and during 

60
00:03:38,171 --> 00:03:39,004
this time,
Christina Fernandez didn't stay on the 

61
00:03:40,961 --> 00:03:41,794
sidelines.
She made her career in the legislative 

62
00:03:43,211 --> 00:03:44,044
chambers as provincial deputy national 
deputy national senator until in 2007 

63
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:49,743
she arrived at the presidency of the 
republic and then in 2015 she went back 

64
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:55,660
to the Senate.
Yes,

65
00:03:55,661 --> 00:03:57,460
it seems like the couch and has had it 
very,

66
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,130
very clear between the legal profession 
and politics,

67
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,700
politics more than 30 years of living 
off taxpayers,

68
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,620
certainly something of a career.
However,

69
00:04:05,830 --> 00:04:06,910
just a moment.
Yeah,

70
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:12,870
I'm not going to be not a funny image 
need that you see though,

71
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:22,710
if he throws,
Hello Ziff Santa Cruz,

72
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:24,943
which is where the coaching has began.
Their political career isn't only far 

73
00:04:27,831 --> 00:04:30,350
from the capitol,
which after all is the center of power.

74
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:35,630
In 2001 it's population didn't even 
reach 200,000 inhabitants.

75
00:04:35,660 --> 00:04:38,810
It was about 0.5% of the country's 
entire population,

76
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,690
which at the time was approximately 36 
million people.

77
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:44,503
So how did to politicians are a place 
that is so far from the core of power 

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,890
and so small take control of the entire 
country.

79
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:52,753
This is the question that many 
journalists and political analysts have 

80
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:57,170
been asking for a long time.
Well,

81
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:59,480
now we're beginning to unravel the 
onset.

82
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:01,940
Basically,
this husband and wife duo took over,

83
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,803
co opted and bought almost every sector 
of Argentinian politics through the 

84
00:05:07,071 --> 00:05:07,970
power of their wallet.

85
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:10,373
No,
look,

86
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:15,610
grandma,
they didn't know [inaudible]

87
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,990
businessmen,
trade unionist,

88
00:05:23,020 --> 00:05:24,220
judges,
journalists,

89
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:25,083
artists,
and civil society leaders succumbed to 

90
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:27,814
the power of the state's wallet.
It was billions of dollars distributed 

91
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:35,050
among the pockets of those who supported
and his word unconditional supporters of

92
00:05:35,051 --> 00:05:39,580
this peculiar marriage [inaudible] tell 
network fed and greased by concessions,

93
00:05:39,581 --> 00:05:40,414
aid and subsidies that were conveniently
distributors and which nobody 

94
00:05:43,451 --> 00:05:44,590
controlled.
However,

95
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:47,620
the question that we have to ask 
ourselves is,

96
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:48,483
how did they finance it?
How did the connection is maintained 

97
00:05:50,231 --> 00:05:52,160
such an ample wallet?
Well listen up,

98
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,830
grandmas that to see it.

99
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:00,600
[inaudible]

100
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:07,230
goal of public works.

101
00:06:08,890 --> 00:06:09,560
Okay,

102
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:09,831
look,
good.

103
00:06:09,831 --> 00:06:13,760
Watch Cristina Fernandez said in 2010 
for us,

104
00:06:13,850 --> 00:06:17,510
for this administration,
public work isn't a contingency.

105
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:18,373
It's a conviction,
a structural political concept that 

106
00:06:20,961 --> 00:06:21,794
we've been developing not only since 
2003 but since we gained the 

107
00:06:25,341 --> 00:06:28,550
responsibility of directing a 
community's destiny.

108
00:06:28,610 --> 00:06:29,443
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner,
while now we know why public works were 

109
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:35,330
so important for this marriage and no,
I'm sorry,

110
00:06:35,331 --> 00:06:38,240
but it has nothing to do with 
Argentina's interests.

111
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:42,470
Public work was one of the core parts of
the catch in his political fabric,

112
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,340
first in the province of Santa Cruz and 
then throughout the entire country.

113
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,510
Now,
some of you might be wondering,

114
00:06:47,511 --> 00:06:48,200
well,
Simon,

115
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:50,390
hold on a second.
How did the system actually work?

116
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:51,253
Well,
you'll see that deep down it was 

117
00:06:52,581 --> 00:06:55,790
actually quite simple.
President Kartchner three as minister of

118
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,580
federal planning and public investment,
Julio Davido,

119
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:02,300
he stayed in this post for the entire 
period in which the catch and is headed.

120
00:07:02,301 --> 00:07:03,134
The country met periodically with the 
main construction companies in 

121
00:07:05,241 --> 00:07:06,074
Argentina,
which in turn were convened by the 

122
00:07:08,001 --> 00:07:09,800
president of the Chamber of 
Construction.

123
00:07:09,801 --> 00:07:10,970
Call us vogner.
Well,

124
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:11,804
in these meetings,
it was agreed exactly which company 

125
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:15,920
would get each public tender.
That is essentially,

126
00:07:15,921 --> 00:07:18,650
they were meeting to decide how to 
distribute the case.

127
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,563
Okay.

128
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:25,590
When everything was decided,
the tender procedure actually started,

129
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:28,020
but this was simply familiar 
appearances.

130
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:28,883
The company which was chosen was the one
that this kind of public works cartel 

131
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,330
had previously.
Agreed.

132
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:37,970
Okay.
Now comes the key to the entire process.

133
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:39,853
Once the work was granted,
the companies charged the first 

134
00:07:41,661 --> 00:07:42,494
installment of the contracts,
the advanced payments they needed to 

135
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,030
supposedly begin working.
However,

136
00:07:47,031 --> 00:07:50,420
this payments was given in higher lead 
to the politicians.

137
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:52,960
Doris,
they can see me and go,

138
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:57,290
[inaudible] [inaudible],
[inaudible],

139
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:01,680
[inaudible], [inaudible] else,
you know,

140
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:03,910
sorry.
Hold on a second.

141
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:04,803
Where was the business if these 
companies had to pay back what they 

142
00:08:07,361 --> 00:08:08,410
charged?
Well,

143
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:10,510
that was in the extra costs.

144
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,053
Okay.

145
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:14,913
It's estimated that on average,
each project's extra cost ranged from 

146
00:08:17,811 --> 00:08:21,320
between 30 and 40% of the total bill.
That way.

147
00:08:21,321 --> 00:08:22,154
If work was grounded for 100 million 
budget expansions were approved for up 

148
00:08:25,311 --> 00:08:28,370
to a total of approximately 140 million,
but that's not all.

149
00:08:28,371 --> 00:08:32,540
Sometimes the government would also 
prove changes and new project expansions

150
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:33,403
until the company that had been awarded 
the $100 million work ended up charging 

151
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:41,770
a lot more on ac 200 250 million and 
even up to 2.8 times the initial budgets

152
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,633
because I mean in this example,
280 million and to top it all off at 

153
00:08:46,491 --> 00:08:48,920
many of these projects,
they weren't even finished.

154
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,180
Yup.
You heard that right?

155
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,140
Of course.
In exchange for this bargain,

156
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:52,993
companies paid bribes to politicians 
depending on the case between 10 to 20% 

157
00:08:56,671 --> 00:08:58,320
of the invoiced amount.
Having said that,

158
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:01,200
have you ever wanted our public work 
functions in your country?

159
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:04,680
The thing is that this thing worked 
perfectly for years,

160
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,930
but now while it's been exposed

161
00:09:07,110 --> 00:09:12,110
and did it for 700 book it,
but I said not neglecting him.

162
00:09:18,220 --> 00:09:23,220
[inaudible] seizures in Brazil.
Fico,

163
00:09:25,830 --> 00:09:26,591
no,
no,

164
00:09:26,591 --> 00:09:28,000
no.
Why not?

165
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,630
Okay.

166
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,463
Discovered sole details really counts 
out when one doesn't take care of all 

167
00:09:38,381 --> 00:09:39,214
the details.
Even the most complex and ingenious 

168
00:09:40,811 --> 00:09:44,350
operations run.
The risk of collapsing this case was not

169
00:09:44,351 --> 00:09:45,000
an accent.

170
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:45,833
Okay.

171
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,853
See,
it turns out that the driver who 

172
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:51,180
transported the government's bribe 
collector was obsessed with writing down

173
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:52,500
each trip,
each stuffed,

174
00:09:52,501 --> 00:09:53,334
each building visitors the name of the 
people he was going to see for the 

175
00:09:55,590 --> 00:09:58,650
briefcase delivery.
Even the conversations he had during his

176
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,484
travels,
he had written down practically 

177
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,643
everything in eight notebooks.
We don't know if he did it on impulse 

178
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,504
for entertainments,
if it was part of the kind of control 

179
00:10:07,991 --> 00:10:08,824
and accounting system,
or perhaps even simply wanted to cover 

180
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:12,000
his back.
The reality is though,

181
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:15,240
that these notebooks contain all the 
details of this matthew,

182
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:18,673
and finally those new books came into 
the hands of a journalist who upon 

183
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:24,650
seeing what they contained,
decided to turn them over to justice.

184
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,110
And after months of investigation,
at the end of July,

185
00:10:27,111 --> 00:10:31,430
2018 high officials and businessmen 
linked to this plot where arrested.

186
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:33,320
But that's not all.
Now,

187
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:34,183
many of these people have decided to 
collaborate with the Justice Department 

188
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,633
in exchange for benefits such as not 
being in prison while the process 

189
00:10:40,671 --> 00:10:41,504
continues.
I'm one of those individuals is Carlos 

190
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:44,623
Wagner,
the president of the Chamber of 

191
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:46,970
construction,
the man who called the companies and one

192
00:10:46,971 --> 00:10:49,760
of the people who benefited most from 
this entire mass.

193
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,613
His story confirms everything.
The notebook set and the other 

194
00:10:52,821 --> 00:10:55,460
testimonies they went in the same line 
right now.

195
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:56,600
I'm sure you might be wondering,
well,

196
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:58,880
all right Simon,
but how much money are we really talking

197
00:10:58,881 --> 00:10:59,810
about here?
Well,

198
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,673
the reality is it is a ton of money.
See if Collins Wagner is telling the 

199
00:11:03,891 --> 00:11:04,724
truth,
the cartoonist would have received 

200
00:11:05,510 --> 00:11:10,510
almost $3 million a day and they did 
that for that entire 12 and a half years

201
00:11:12,531 --> 00:11:13,364
in government.
That is more than $12 billion in total 

202
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,770
and that's only from the public works,
but something just the public works.

203
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:22,130
There are many more suspicions of 
corruption and pending cases.

204
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:25,190
Yes,

205
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,620
I actually got $12 billion to pay 
politicians,

206
00:11:27,621 --> 00:11:28,640
judges,
journalists,

207
00:11:28,670 --> 00:11:31,400
social leaders,
and of course fill their own pockets.

208
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,263
Everything indicates that this is how 
the Kushners came to power and 

209
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,980
consolidated their power over Argentina.

210
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:40,150
For example,

211
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:40,983
this will say Jose Lopez case,
a format public work secretary and 

212
00:11:43,391 --> 00:11:44,224
someone who was very close to Julio to 
veto the catch and arrest minister who 

213
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:48,603
managed the plot well in June of 2016 
having been alerted that the police 

214
00:11:51,971 --> 00:11:54,220
could rate as house as of an 
investigation,

215
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:55,083
he decided to leave at three in the 
morning with $9 billion that he had in 

216
00:11:58,091 --> 00:12:00,310
cash hidden under his mattress.
Anyway,

217
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,144
that night,
Lopez trying to hide the money in a 

218
00:12:02,141 --> 00:12:02,974
confidence,
the confidence of the praying and 

219
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:07,330
Pennington nuns of our lady of the 
rosary of Fatima,

220
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:10,630
but this didn't have the best of luck.
Lani was stashing the money.

221
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:14,080
A neighbor who thought that it was a 
robbery called the police and that's how

222
00:12:14,081 --> 00:12:17,260
good Aalto seemed.
Lopez was caught red handed and yes,

223
00:12:17,261 --> 00:12:18,800
we'd know where all that money probably 
came.

224
00:12:18,801 --> 00:12:23,801
Right.
As you can imagine,

225
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:27,050
this money couldn't simply be 
transferred to a bank.

226
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:28,850
No,
it had to be paid in cash so it wouldn't

227
00:12:28,851 --> 00:12:31,490
leave a trace.
It was moved in bags.

228
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,140
Well,
since they made so many payments,

229
00:12:33,141 --> 00:12:33,974
the people in charge of filling the bags
already knew how many money wads fit 

230
00:12:36,711 --> 00:12:39,590
into each bag.
So it seems that the money was no longer

231
00:12:39,591 --> 00:12:42,440
counted in millions,
but simply by number of bags.

232
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:45,763
Wow.

233
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:48,920
Do not forget the companies also made 
money by overpricing.

234
00:12:48,921 --> 00:12:52,400
So the damage to the Argentine people 
has been even greater anyway.

235
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,253
Dvo this is the grease of story of how 
some politicians decided to plunder 

236
00:12:56,181 --> 00:12:58,120
their own country.
If the facts are confirmed,

237
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:01,670
even the underwoods would be scandalized
by Argentina situation.

238
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,920
So well,
Christina Fernandez end up in jail.

239
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:05,510
Well,
I need time will tell.
