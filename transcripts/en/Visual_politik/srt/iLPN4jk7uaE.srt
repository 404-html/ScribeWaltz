1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,950
Sebastian pinera is already presidents.
Well,

2
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:15,070
actually he's president again because as
you all know,

3
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:17,410
this political leader was president of 
Chile,

4
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,340
barely two mandates ago,
between 2010 and 2014

5
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:27,913
Tina

6
00:00:28,100 --> 00:00:28,933
now after achieving a strong and healthy
victory by almost 10 points in the 2017 

7
00:00:33,201 --> 00:00:34,034
presidential elections to and pin yarrow
was declared president on March the 

8
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,490
11th.
They have you in this video today,

9
00:00:49,451 --> 00:00:50,284
we are going to be seeing what kinds of 
chili this president is inheriting as 

10
00:00:54,071 --> 00:00:56,710
well as the greatest challenges that lie
ahead for him,

11
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:59,410
but first of all,
let's get to know this character better.

12
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:02,630
Let's see who Sebastian Pinera really 
is.

13
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,360
Yes.

14
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,413
Is Sebastian Kenyatta?
We need to know that Sebastian Pinera 

15
00:01:14,391 --> 00:01:17,830
for many reasons,
isn't just another politician we use.

16
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,330
We're talking about a man who on the one
hand zones,

17
00:01:20,331 --> 00:01:24,530
one of the biggest fortunes in Chile for
Fortune Forbes magazine estimates.

18
00:01:24,531 --> 00:01:27,590
There's no less than two point 
$7,000,000,000.

19
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:29,480
Yep.
You heard that right?

20
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,100
You'll see them.
They'll go,

21
00:01:34,130 --> 00:01:39,130
yet nobody's suitable.
Keep the feet on the politicals.

22
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:48,670
He lost the wound book.
I know.

23
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,680
Yes.
Sebastian Pinera was an aggressive,

24
00:01:55,690 --> 00:01:59,340
self-made businessmen,
but do not be fooled by his smile.

25
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:00,174
His record shows that for a long time 
knew how to play to the limit and it's 

26
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,830
become a major investor in various 
sectors such as construction,

27
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:09,450
supermarkets,
airlines,

28
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:12,090
and TV channels.
Now that I think about it,

29
00:02:12,091 --> 00:02:15,750
it's really hard to find a sexier in 
which pin Yaarit didn't try his luck.

30
00:02:15,751 --> 00:02:16,584
Even in 2006,
he decided to death on the football 

31
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:21,690
industry and took control of a team,
but not just any team.

32
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,553
Nope.
He took control of the most important 

33
00:02:23,821 --> 00:02:26,250
soccer team in Chile.
Color color.

34
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:27,143
Of course.
Many critics accuse him of buying this 

35
00:02:28,621 --> 00:02:29,454
team north as an investment spot,
as a political maneuver like Silvio 

36
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,660
Berlusconi,
but don't think that Pinera is exploit,

37
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,340
swell only in the business exit.
Not at all.

38
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:39,174
In fact,

39
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,310
the political arena,
the current president of Chile also left

40
00:02:45,311 --> 00:02:46,144
his mark in 2010,
he became the first right wing 

41
00:02:48,341 --> 00:02:51,880
presidents to be democratically elected 
since 1958.

42
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:53,043
He also became the first right wing 
president since Chile underwent its 

43
00:02:55,420 --> 00:02:58,770
democratic transition after a Gusto 
Pinochet's Yep.

44
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,880
Now in 2018,
this is happening again.

45
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,143
In other words,
we could say that Sebastien Vignette 

46
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:10,240
road is a pretty fortunate guy and I 
don't think he'd disagree.

47
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,710
Well,
the fact is that in his first term,

48
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
despite having to face the consequences 
of a terrible earthquake that shook his 

49
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,720
country just two weeks before he took 
office,

50
00:03:16,721 --> 00:03:19,540
his first governments had relatively 
good results,

51
00:03:20,140 --> 00:03:20,973
at least half of our efforts throughout 
the entire administration were devoted 

52
00:03:23,771 --> 00:03:24,604
to rebuilding the country,
and consequently we had to sacrifice 

53
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:30,460
many things.
We wanted to do Rodrigo Hinzpeter,

54
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,353
minister of the interior and Minister of
defense in Sebastian Pianos for 

55
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,060
government.
The truth is that no great revolutionary

56
00:03:37,061 --> 00:03:38,890
change really happens.
However,

57
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:39,724
in his first four years of government in
the economy grew by more than five 

58
00:03:41,861 --> 00:03:44,620
percent per year,
more than 1 million jobs were created,

59
00:03:44,770 --> 00:03:47,590
wages increased,
poverty fell sharply.

60
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:49,413
We had a really good government in which
every social and economic indicator 

61
00:03:52,481 --> 00:03:53,314
improved in Chile,
but I have more experience now and 

62
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,380
experience counts,
Sebastian Miata.

63
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:59,530
And the truth is the viewer.
In this case,

64
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,560
all that experience can be really,
really important.

65
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,760
And why is this?
Well,

66
00:04:03,761 --> 00:04:06,010
because today chili is really quite 
different.

67
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:07,390
I mean,
pay attention to this.

68
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:24,680
Today's Chili.

69
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:25,940
Yeah.

70
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:30,240
He told you here on visual politic 
previously,

71
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,100
and I don't think it will surprise 
anyone,

72
00:04:32,101 --> 00:04:32,934
but in the last few decades,
Chile has been something like Latin 

73
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,190
America's Christiana,
Ronaldo,

74
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:41,280
the country that grew the most,
the one that had the most success,

75
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:45,060
convincing proof of this was the 
evolution of the Chilean middle class,

76
00:04:45,061 --> 00:04:49,290
which multiplies by almost three within 
a very short span of time.

77
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:50,873
The Chilean Middleclass grew from 23 
point seven percent to 64 point three 

78
00:04:54,631 --> 00:04:57,870
percent of the population in 25 years.
However,

79
00:04:57,871 --> 00:04:59,940
as we saw in a previous video in recent 
years,

80
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:02,610
specifically during Micell Bash,
allays last term,

81
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,080
things really changed.

82
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:09,810
Wished you let them sooner.

83
00:05:18,010 --> 00:05:18,890
Yeah.

84
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:24,940
As we mentioned in recent years,
economic growth has plummeted.

85
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,860
Job Creation has slowed,
wages haven't grown,

86
00:05:28,010 --> 00:05:30,350
and foreign investment has dropped.
Lately.

87
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:34,880
The only thing that has grown in Chile 
has been the number of public employees,

88
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,280
taxes and bureaucracy.
That's right.

89
00:05:37,281 --> 00:05:38,114
Practically every economic parameters 
made a very negative change during the 

90
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,010
child.
Ashley's last time.

91
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,360
I mean,
check this out,

92
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:48,620
there has been an average growth of 
belly one point eight percent per year,

93
00:05:48,621 --> 00:05:49,454
which implies that this legislation was 
the worst economic growth since the 

94
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,550
democratic trends

95
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,560
session.
In fact,

96
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,280
in recent years she has grown,

97
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,163
uh,
less than the world economy and it's 

98
00:05:59,781 --> 00:06:02,520
considerably less than it's specific 
alliance counterparts,

99
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:03,620
Mexico,
Peru,

100
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,633
and Colombia.
And that's not all the public deficit 

101
00:06:06,921 --> 00:06:10,370
when from being a guest to a permanent 
tenants.

102
00:06:10,371 --> 00:06:12,770
And of course that's certainly has 
consequences.

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,480
Public debt,
although still low,

104
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:18,420
has reached its highest level since 
1993.

105
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,240
Having the fiscal debt double every four
years isn't sustainable.

106
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,670
That's the road to the precipice for 
leap.

107
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:31,560
Lorraine,
Minister of finance,

108
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,483
although by far the worst development 
has been the four year consecutive drop 

109
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:38,670
in investments and it wasn't only the 
economy that went.

110
00:06:38,671 --> 00:06:39,504
South crime rates have increased a lot 
in the near region where there's a 

111
00:06:44,041 --> 00:06:44,874
conflict with the indigenous people.
The mapuches who demands more autonomy 

112
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:48,714
and recognition.
Violent acts have exploded growing by a 

113
00:06:51,671 --> 00:06:53,370
hundred and 50 percent.

114
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:08,483
And even regarding the government's 
decision to suspend the hospital 

115
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:11,814
concession system has meant that the 
government has barely been able to 

116
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,470
invest more than half of what they'd 
budgeted,

117
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,950
making wait lists and quality issues,
a chronic problem,

118
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:23,850
and let's not deceive ourselves here as 
always,

119
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:26,730
the ones most effected by all of this 
are not the richest,

120
00:07:26,731 --> 00:07:29,910
but the middle class,
and even more so for the most vulnerable

121
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:31,980
people in the population,
the poor people.

122
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:32,843
In other words,
it's fair to say the Chileans have new 

123
00:07:34,021 --> 00:07:36,570
reason to celebrate me,
how Basha lays last time.

124
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,463
Indeed,
they were an incredibly intense four 

125
00:07:39,121 --> 00:07:39,954
years.
Now perhaps we could analyze what's 

126
00:07:44,271 --> 00:07:47,150
happening in Chile by taking a look at 
their economic freedom index,

127
00:07:47,151 --> 00:07:51,500
who's correlation with a country's level
of wealth and prosperity is very high.

128
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,730
Well,
during the calabash relays,

129
00:07:52,731 --> 00:07:55,560
last term,
eat felt from seventh position too.

130
00:07:56,170 --> 00:07:57,003
Yeah.

131
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:02,673
Anyway,
this is the situation that the new 

132
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:04,444
president of Chile has to face.
And now the question we need to ask 

133
00:08:06,761 --> 00:08:07,594
ourselves is,
what should this new government's 

134
00:08:09,311 --> 00:08:11,320
priorities be?
What can we expect?

135
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:13,000
What should we expect from them?
Well,

136
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:13,660
let's take a look.

137
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:18,660
That's the name of it.
If you're not getting it a little bit,

138
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:43,270
great challenges.
Well,

139
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,113
it seems quite clear.
There's in a country that isn't exactly 

140
00:08:45,801 --> 00:08:49,700
cheap and in which three out of four 
workers make less than $800 a month,

141
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:52,850
the economy has to be then number one 
priority.

142
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:56,310
If the economy isn't doing well,
social statistics do well either,

143
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:59,070
and this seems to be very,
very clear for the new government.

144
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,923
In fact,
Pinera,

145
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,040
the new president has promised to focus 
his efforts on doubling economic growth.

146
00:09:05,041 --> 00:09:05,874
Creating hundreds of jobs sends laying 
the foundations for Chile to become the 

147
00:09:08,761 --> 00:09:12,270
first developed country in Latin America
by 2025,

148
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,590
but of course you might be thinking,
well,

149
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:17,543
how on earth can they achieve this?
I hope he doesn't think that a mere tax 

150
00:09:21,061 --> 00:09:23,220
reform is going to be enough to restore 
Chili's.

151
00:09:23,221 --> 00:09:27,480
Growth is going to need an aggressive 
policy to stimulate diversification.

152
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,720
Almost half of the country's exports are
still copper.

153
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,580
Ricardo Hausmann.
Well,

154
00:09:32,581 --> 00:09:34,150
to achieve the 20,
25 goal,

155
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,920
the country needs to deal with three 
very clear priorities,

156
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:40,710
diversifying their economy,
improve their productivity,

157
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,573
and adjust their public accounts.
But do not think that this is an easy 

158
00:09:45,721 --> 00:09:49,020
task to diversify the economy,
to stop relying on raw materials,

159
00:09:49,021 --> 00:09:51,210
especially copper and boost their 
productivity.

160
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,700
Then near is Chile will need a few 
things.

161
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,500
First,
they will need to promote investment,

162
00:09:55,501 --> 00:09:56,334
especially foreign investments that is 
attract more companies and foreign 

163
00:09:58,861 --> 00:10:02,430
capital who will bet on Shelly to 
produce and provide services.

164
00:10:02,460 --> 00:10:05,490
Ms Dot lamb could really be helped by a 
reversal of bash delays,

165
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:06,324
terrible tax reform,
which not only raised taxes on 

166
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:10,800
companies,
but also punished that investments.

167
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,140
This was really not a good idea.
Further,

168
00:10:13,141 --> 00:10:15,960
they should decrease the huge 
bureaucracy that exists.

169
00:10:15,961 --> 00:10:19,200
For example,
by digitizing every possible process.

170
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:20,063
Seconds,
and this is a much more controversial 

171
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:22,704
issue for this Latin American country.
They need to promote a program to 

172
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:27,570
attract foreign talents.
Yeah,

173
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,630
they really need to be promoting 
immigration.

174
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:32,440
You see,
in Chile,

175
00:10:32,441 --> 00:10:35,140
the immigrant population has grown a lot
in recent years,

176
00:10:35,141 --> 00:10:35,974
but it's still very low.
It hasn't even reached three percent of 

177
00:10:38,051 --> 00:10:38,884
the population and she lands like to 
compare themselves with Australia and 

178
00:10:41,891 --> 00:10:45,250
New Zealand were immigrants make up 30 
percent of the total population.

179
00:10:45,400 --> 00:10:47,470
10 Times more than they do in Chile.
Yes,

180
00:10:47,471 --> 00:10:48,304
you really did hear that right,
and the best way to gain talents and 

181
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:50,944
promote different businesses and 
activities is to attract people with 

182
00:10:53,381 --> 00:10:55,840
different skills and abilities from all 
over the world.

183
00:10:58,350 --> 00:11:00,900
We're actually going to be discussing 
that in more detail really soon,

184
00:11:00,930 --> 00:11:02,760
but for now,
here's a great example.

185
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:05,490
In Silicon Valley,
the great global innovation center,

186
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:07,970
Fifty four percent of entrepreneurs are 
foreign.

187
00:11:07,971 --> 00:11:12,060
Yeah,
we're not talking about an open door,

188
00:11:12,061 --> 00:11:12,894
but we are talking about setting up a 
mechanism that clarifies and promotes 

189
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,940
talent attraction because,
well,

190
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:19,740
the end of the day,
if it all goes well,

191
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,633
surely you can aspire to become the 
great benchmark for business in Latin 

192
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:25,013
America.
And that implies attracting 

193
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:29,410
professionals.
In addition,

194
00:11:29,411 --> 00:11:33,370
and this is an important detail,
according to all Chilean standards,

195
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:37,360
immigrants have more education on 
average that Labor participation is much

196
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:38,770
higher and they even though

197
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,033
money

198
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:41,473
policies eat,
needs to enforce improving relations 

199
00:11:43,611 --> 00:11:44,444
between universities and companies 
fighting insecurity and ending the 

200
00:11:47,541 --> 00:11:50,990
public deficits as well as improving 
infrastructure and increasing savings.

201
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:55,793
So now if we take a look at the program,
we will see that the president's 

202
00:11:58,901 --> 00:11:59,734
promises seem to align with this,
so in principle has been as good change 

203
00:12:02,891 --> 00:12:04,690
is going to be really good for Chile.
Now,

204
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:06,070
of course,
as always,

205
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:07,083
only time will tell,
but just hold on a moment because not 

206
00:12:09,491 --> 00:12:12,270
everything is quite so simple.
See,

207
00:12:12,271 --> 00:12:13,104
due to an electoral reform that a 
promoted pin Jerez coalition doesn't 

208
00:12:15,881 --> 00:12:19,870
have a majority in Congress,
so negotiating and seeking parliamentary

209
00:12:19,871 --> 00:12:23,200
agreements will be a priority for this 
new governmental team.

210
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,093
So Dev you are.
That's the way things are in Chile 

211
00:12:26,171 --> 00:12:27,490
today,
but now it's your turn.

212
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:30,640
What's your opinion on Sebastian Pinera 
is new governments.

213
00:12:30,670 --> 00:12:33,520
Do you think his government will be good
for Chile?

214
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,740
