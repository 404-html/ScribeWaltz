1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:10,430
1945

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,133
sorry,
53,000 ton flagship of Admiral Halsey 

4
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:21,640
becomes the scene of an unforgettable 
ceremony marking the complete and primal

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,670
surrender of Japan.

6
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:29,260
On August the 15th of 1945 having 
suffered the only nuclear bomb attack in

7
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,313
history only a few days previously for 
Japanese government's finally 

8
00:00:33,051 --> 00:00:33,884
surrendered.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:39,530
Ash Supreme Commander for the allied 
powers.

10
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:40,753
I announced my firm in the tradition of 
the country that I represent crocheted 

11
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:50,950
and the discharge if my responsibilities
while taking all national,

12
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,594
sorry,
just position to ensure at the term 

13
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,063
surrender our pull,
a pump play and faithfully complied 

14
00:01:00,801 --> 00:01:01,634
with.

15
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,870
At that moment,
Japan was the defeated country.

16
00:01:10,871 --> 00:01:12,850
Its economy was shattered in the 
Japanese.

17
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:13,684
It's suffered unimaginable damage.
Not only were they immersed in extreme 

18
00:01:17,471 --> 00:01:18,304
poverty,
they had also lost more than 3 million 

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:22,210
compatriots,
brothers,

20
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,880
sons,
even mothers wore it.

21
00:01:24,881 --> 00:01:25,714
Takes a terrible toll with this grim 
picture is the situation in 1945 the 

22
00:01:29,471 --> 00:01:31,900
question that we might ask ourselves is,
well,

23
00:01:31,930 --> 00:01:32,763
how did Japan managed to become one of 
the greatest economic powers on the 

24
00:01:36,011 --> 00:01:36,844
planet in such a short amount of time?
And how did the Japanese recover so 

25
00:01:39,551 --> 00:01:41,080
quickly with such might.

26
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:49,063
Okay.

27
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:50,263
Dev you out here on visual politic,
we've already talked about the 

28
00:01:52,131 --> 00:01:55,010
differences between the German model and
the Japanese model.

29
00:01:55,011 --> 00:01:59,090
We've also told you about how Japan 
transformed from a Med eval country to a

30
00:01:59,091 --> 00:02:01,280
thriving modern nation.
However,

31
00:02:01,281 --> 00:02:02,114
we still need to answer the question of 
how Japan managed to become a great 

32
00:02:05,001 --> 00:02:05,834
wells power interest a few years.
Let me tell you right now for the 

33
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:08,984
Japanese model is rather peculiar,
so we're going to need more than one 

34
00:02:13,011 --> 00:02:13,844
video to explain it here in this video,
we're going to see a few brush strokes 

35
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:20,620
in the whole picture that don't worry.
More chapters are absolutely going

36
00:02:20,750 --> 00:02:21,583
falling.

37
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:32,540
The post war 45 it seemed like 
everything that had been built after the

38
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,120
Meiji Restoration of 1868 I simply 
evaporated.

39
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:38,013
Moreover,
as if that weren't enough for the first 

40
00:02:39,821 --> 00:02:43,150
time in its history,
Japan was occupied by the United States.

41
00:02:46,150 --> 00:02:46,983
Yeah.

42
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:51,330
Hold on for just a second because it 
wasn't all bad news.

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,253
As we'll see.
The Japanese also had three aces up 

44
00:02:54,181 --> 00:02:55,014
their sleeves,
three characteristics that would launch 

45
00:02:57,061 --> 00:02:57,894
their country into the stratosphere,
turning us into one of the richest 

46
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:02,013
countries on the planet.
And that's all in spite of the many 

47
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:05,194
political mistakes that both the 
occupation forces and the local 

48
00:03:07,361 --> 00:03:09,220
authorities would make over the coming 
year.

49
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,043
So you want to know what the three 
ingredients where the main ingredients 

50
00:03:21,571 --> 00:03:23,970
of this Japanese success recipe?
Well,

51
00:03:23,971 --> 00:03:24,804
first of all,
a huge ability and his predilection for 

52
00:03:27,451 --> 00:03:30,480
saving you see in Asian countries in 
general in Japan,

53
00:03:30,481 --> 00:03:33,690
is no exception.
Family is trying to save every penny and

54
00:03:33,691 --> 00:03:36,090
much more so than almost any other place
on it.

55
00:03:36,091 --> 00:03:36,924
Yeah.

56
00:03:38,010 --> 00:03:38,620
Okay.

57
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,453
Why?
While there are many explanations for 

58
00:03:41,081 --> 00:03:43,120
this phenomena,
cultural preference,

59
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,640
trends towards less consumption in the 
present,

60
00:03:45,641 --> 00:03:46,474
in order to spend more in the future,
or just because of a lack of public 

61
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:49,984
services,
which tend to be very limited in this 

62
00:03:51,821 --> 00:03:56,821
part of the world.
All of these explanations may have a bit

63
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:59,020
of truth to them,
but regardless,

64
00:03:59,021 --> 00:04:01,780
these huge amounts of savings all then 
invested,

65
00:04:01,781 --> 00:04:02,614
which creates productive capital,
that obviously leads to higher 

66
00:04:05,261 --> 00:04:06,720
production and 12th level.

67
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,390
Yes,

68
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:12,140
savings that allow us to direct our 
efforts for a long time.

69
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,033
Not to satisfy our immediate needs,
but to worry about satisfying or future 

70
00:04:16,521 --> 00:04:19,880
needs.
We produce capital goods so that they in

71
00:04:19,881 --> 00:04:20,714
turn,
manufacturer the future consumer goods 

72
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:25,530
we may need Juan Ramon Ryo.
Alright.

73
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:26,443
So the first days that Japan had up its 
sleeve after the war was an enormous 

74
00:04:29,391 --> 00:04:32,150
propensity to save savings,
savings,

75
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,430
and just bought savings.
The second,

76
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,760
it had a lot to do with the Meiji 
Restoration of 18

77
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,873
the yes,

78
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,740
you'll see as we saw her in a previous 
video,

79
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:43,574
one of the first things the Japanese 
government did after the regime change 

80
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,210
was bet on creating a very powerful 
educational system.

81
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,530
They established universal primary 
education and promoted universities,

82
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:56,720
academies,
research centers,

83
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:59,150
et Cetera.
Thus after the second world war,

84
00:04:59,180 --> 00:05:00,013
despite their situation,
the Japanese were the most well trained 

85
00:05:02,751 --> 00:05:03,584
workers on the entire Asian continent.
And of course this entails a huge 

86
00:05:07,761 --> 00:05:08,630
competitive advantage.

87
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:09,573
Sure.

88
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,073
So one of the first measures taken after
the war was pushing the educational 

89
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:18,420
system even further.
And so what's the third card?

90
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,130
Well,
is the one you can probably guess.

91
00:05:20,131 --> 00:05:20,964
And that's the Japanese is huge capacity
and willingness for working long hours 

92
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,230
and in some cases they've even taken 
things ranked to the extreme.

93
00:05:28,231 --> 00:05:29,064
I mean,
do you know any other country in the 

94
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,044
world and it has a word for death from 
working too much Karoshi death from 

95
00:05:35,731 --> 00:05:39,030
working too much is a public health 
problem in Japan.

96
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,860
The fact is that all three of these 
factors,

97
00:05:40,861 --> 00:05:43,440
they gave Japan a huge capacity to 
recover,

98
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,303
grow and create a great deal of wealth.
But hold on a second because while 

99
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,233
having seen all of this,
what exactly are the stages that Japan 

100
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:53,100
goes through in order for this economic 
miracle to happen?

101
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,150
Well,
listen up

102
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:57,853
day,

103
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,993
no,

104
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:01,833
the stages,
the process we're about to explore 

105
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:08,600
starts with the u s is occupation of 
Japan.

106
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:09,980
After the end of the war.
See,

107
00:06:09,981 --> 00:06:12,470
the occupation forces had two major 
priorities.

108
00:06:12,471 --> 00:06:15,380
Do you demilitarize and democratize 
Japan?

109
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,510
It's around this time,
for example,

110
00:06:18,511 --> 00:06:22,110
that the new constitution establishing a
democratic system was created.

111
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:22,973
It equalized men's and women's rights 
and it stripped to Japan if it's right 

112
00:06:25,921 --> 00:06:28,500
to wage war,
dismantling its armed forces.

113
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:29,393
In addition to the occupation forces 
copied us institutions and launched 

114
00:06:32,131 --> 00:06:34,950
reforms that had some benefits and any 
drawbacks.

115
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:37,933
One day we're going to need to talk 
about how badly the military has always 

116
00:06:40,581 --> 00:06:42,920
managed the economy of countries they've
controls,

117
00:06:42,921 --> 00:06:44,720
but that's something we'll deal with in 
a future video.

118
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:47,780
The fact is that the priority of these 
reforms was to eliminate,

119
00:06:47,781 --> 00:06:49,990
or at least to reduce the power of the 
auto.

120
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,720
Oxy supported Japanese expansionism and 
militarism to do so.

121
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,870
The sale of lands from big landowners to
small farmers.

122
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,733
It was approved measures were taken to 
dissolve these I babbsu large business 

123
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:02,480
groups.
There's engaged in many activities,

124
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:03,314
but we're controlled by a single family 
and antitrust law that outlawed 

125
00:07:06,051 --> 00:07:06,884
monopolies was also passed in 1947 and 
the unionization of workers was also 

126
00:07:10,551 --> 00:07:11,384
promoted.
Everything was done with the intention 

127
00:07:12,951 --> 00:07:14,870
of achieving an economic power chain.

128
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:17,810
Of course,

129
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:20,510
some of these measures,
in addition to limiting the power of the

130
00:07:20,511 --> 00:07:23,720
great oligarchs also had some rather 
positive consequences.

131
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:26,360
For example,
the land of distribution managed to turn

132
00:07:26,361 --> 00:07:29,120
many farmers into owners need demise of 
many of these.

133
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:33,050
I've soup to the emergence of many small
and medium sized enterprises.

134
00:07:33,110 --> 00:07:37,340
In spite of everything the recovery,
it was much slower than expected.

135
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,533
However,
in the 1950s the country has is as it 

136
00:07:42,401 --> 00:07:43,810
were,
a stroke of luck.

137
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,703
The Korean War Tan Japan into one of the
alliance forces suppliers there by 

138
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:50,680
boosting their exports and that 
production southern leave,

139
00:07:50,681 --> 00:07:54,700
Japanese companies and politicians,
they discovered the great global market

140
00:07:54,790 --> 00:07:55,623
gets

141
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:57,743
in 1953 production level says already 
suppose to levels that have been right 

142
00:08:00,691 --> 00:08:01,524
before the war and as the minutes of 
class had a new priority boosting 

143
00:08:04,650 --> 00:08:06,930
economic growth through business.

144
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:15,463
The economic takeoff folks,
the decades of the fifties sixties and 

145
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,070
seventies miraculous years,
they were Japan's golden age.

146
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,730
It was a time led by the Liberal 
Democratic Party,

147
00:08:28,731 --> 00:08:33,200
a political party that ruled the country
for almost 40 uninterrupted years.

148
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,490
A few years ago.
By the way,

149
00:08:34,491 --> 00:08:35,324
it was discovered that the CIA actually 
gave a lot of money to support the 

150
00:08:37,521 --> 00:08:38,354
party's political campaigns.
This is also the party of the current 

151
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:41,864
Prime Minister Shinzo our bay.
The fact is that this party launched a 

152
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,300
very peculiar system.
See,

153
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,143
on the one hand,
it promoted policies that favored 

154
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:56,123
keeping inflation under control and 
slowing down the growth of the public 

155
00:08:58,771 --> 00:09:02,580
sector as well as maintaining low taxes 
and avoiding the accumulation of debt.

156
00:09:02,610 --> 00:09:07,020
This is the opposite of what they do in 
countries like Argentina or obesity,

157
00:09:07,021 --> 00:09:07,854
for example.

158
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:16,370
However,
hold on just a second because that's not

159
00:09:16,371 --> 00:09:16,791
all.
Now,

160
00:09:16,791 --> 00:09:17,624
on the other hand,
unlike what happens in other countries 

161
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:22,700
that achieved great economic takeoff,
the truth is that these governments,

162
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,920
they were quite interventionalist,
for example,

163
00:09:24,921 --> 00:09:28,670
they decided to promote certain 
industries which they themselves chosen,

164
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:31,820
which they helped grow from within the 
government itself.

165
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,713
They also promoted a new counter 
lization of national companies 

166
00:09:35,391 --> 00:09:39,350
supposedly to avoid what they considered
to be excessive competition.

167
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:41,300
Although you know,
I don't really know her,

168
00:09:41,301 --> 00:09:42,134
but that just sure sounds like a way for
them to help out their friends 

169
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,840
regardless.
It did have amazing results.

170
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:53,023
In the early 1960s Prime Minister High 
Eto Keytar announced a plan to double 

171
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:56,864
the size of Japan's economy in just 10 
years to reach this goal of the country 

172
00:09:59,780 --> 00:10:00,613
needed to maintain an annual average 
growth rate of 7.2% for that entire 

173
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:05,264
time.
International analysts considered it 

174
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,110
impossible.
10 years later,

175
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:08,953
Japan had far exceeded its goal.
The country had Moza blind the size of 

176
00:10:11,451 --> 00:10:12,284
its economy by 2.8 because he did an 
average annual growth rate of more than 

177
00:10:15,591 --> 00:10:17,720
9.3%

178
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:20,923
okay,

179
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:24,470
Dustin?
1973 the Japanese economy had multiplied

180
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:29,500
more than five since 1953 that is in 
just 20 years on the other hand,

181
00:10:30,711 --> 00:10:33,770
GDP per capita and multiplied by four 
and within a few years,

182
00:10:33,771 --> 00:10:34,604
Japan became the largest asset holder in
the world and the largest humanitarian 

183
00:10:38,181 --> 00:10:41,210
aid provider,
even the Tokyo Stock Exchange managed to

184
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:44,510
outperform the New York Stock Exchange 
for a short period of time.

185
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:48,920
But you know what?
This is when a great controversy arose.

186
00:10:52,150 --> 00:10:52,983
I want to cite some defended the country
spectacular growth despite all of these 

187
00:10:55,891 --> 00:10:56,724
government policies.
That is to say that the three things we 

188
00:10:58,231 --> 00:10:59,064
covered at the beginning of this video 
savings work and training was so strong 

189
00:11:01,561 --> 00:11:05,160
that they managed to take off in spite 
of the government's interference,

190
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:09,060
but some argue that since the government
caps the macro economic parameters under

191
00:11:09,061 --> 00:11:09,894
control of these public policies 
actually accelerated the country is 

192
00:11:13,441 --> 00:11:14,274
great.

193
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:17,833
Well,
now the only question is which one do 

194
00:11:18,831 --> 00:11:20,650
you think is right?
Which group do you belong to?

195
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:24,320
While leave your answer in the comments 
section below and also in this survey,

196
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,183
what there's little doubt about though 
is that it was exactly during that time 

197
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:33,200
that some of the greatest imbalances 
that lead the country into a huge crisis

198
00:11:33,201 --> 00:11:35,690
from which it hasn't yet recovered 
emerged,

199
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:38,810
but we already talked about that in this
previous other video.

200
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,940
