1
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,490
In the next few decades,
the wells as we know it,

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:12,413
will change the loss.
This will of course bring many 

3
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:17,490
opportunities,
but also many challenges more precisely.

4
00:00:17,491 --> 00:00:18,324
Most of developed countries are facing 
such a large threats that that response 

5
00:00:21,451 --> 00:00:23,730
may determine in economic,
political,

6
00:00:23,731 --> 00:00:26,970
and social times which countries succeed
and which fail.

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:27,833
Folks,
I'm talking about population aging of 

8
00:00:29,641 --> 00:00:33,570
the demographic pyramids.
One hundred and 80 degree turn.

9
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:40,990
Yeah.
I'm sure this isn't news to you.

10
00:00:40,991 --> 00:00:43,600
Most of you have probably already heard 
about this subject.

11
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,463
However,
have you stopped to think about the 

12
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:46,533
processes,
consequences on your government's doing 

13
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:49,863
something about it?
Have they come up with something like a 

14
00:00:51,431 --> 00:00:54,760
contingency plan so you face the risks 
that lie ahead?

15
00:00:54,850 --> 00:00:59,850
I'll listen up world facing a new state

16
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,020
about a hundred years.
Our world has changed a lot.

17
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,060
It has changed so much that if we got a 
time machines,

18
00:01:13,061 --> 00:01:17,220
they some sort of special delorean and 
traveled back two or three centuries for

19
00:01:17,221 --> 00:01:20,670
a season sooner rather than later.
Most of us,

20
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:23,100
if not all of us,
would want to go back home really,

21
00:01:23,101 --> 00:01:25,410
really fast.
We'd be missing loads of things.

22
00:01:25,411 --> 00:01:26,244
Would be horrified by the day to day,
we'd be forced to work intensely harder 

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,590
just to survive and we'd be afraid of 
getting sick because we might die and we

24
00:01:34,591 --> 00:01:37,620
might not even be able to eat.
But let's stay on topic.

25
00:01:37,621 --> 00:01:42,220
Here it is.
At the end of the 19th century,

26
00:01:42,221 --> 00:01:45,610
the world's population surpass the one 
point 5 billion person.

27
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,563
Yeah,

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,710
I mean,
100 years later during the 20th century,

29
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:56,740
the world's population has multiplied by
four and past 6 billion of course,

30
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:05,200
considering the enormous speed with 
which the world population group,

31
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:09,170
we can't be surprised by the fact that 
many experts began to worry about of the

32
00:02:09,190 --> 00:02:10,023
population and do you not think that 
this was just a thing among mediocre 

33
00:02:12,561 --> 00:02:17,561
expert scientists and politicians?
Nineteen 74,

34
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,223
a report by the Secretary of State,
Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon's 

35
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:25,450
government to consider birth control in 
countries such as Brazil,

36
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,261
India,
Mexico,

37
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:27,340
Columbia,
Ethiopia,

38
00:02:27,341 --> 00:02:29,590
and Thailand as a top priority.

39
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,510
Cool.

40
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:32,343
Coming to the report,
the demographic explosion that was 

41
00:02:34,031 --> 00:02:38,770
taking place posed a serious threat to 
the security of the United States.

42
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:41,420
Yeah.
With

43
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:42,263
so many people consuming resources,
Kissinger thought we were heading 

44
00:02:44,371 --> 00:02:48,480
towards a world of scarcity and fear 
struggles for resources.

45
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,450
Have you noticed how Malthusian 
arguments come up again and again,

46
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:53,410
even though they never actually 
happened?

47
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,603
The fact is that while guys like 
Kissinger try to think about how to 

48
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,853
control the world's population and 
influence their decisions to change was 

49
00:03:02,291 --> 00:03:05,410
already taking place.
Such a huge change that it would turn an

50
00:03:05,411 --> 00:03:10,411
entirely new points in the debate.
In the last 50 years.

51
00:03:17,461 --> 00:03:18,294
Welds fertility has halved so much so 
that nowadays Western governments no 

52
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:25,080
longer think about overpopulation,
but rather about aging today,

53
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:29,160
European countries and even the United 
States tend to lose native inhabitants.

54
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:32,420
Check this out.
In Germany,

55
00:03:32,421 --> 00:03:34,370
for example,
since 1972,

56
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:37,730
there have been 5 million more deaths 
than births.

57
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:38,623
However,
the most extreme case has been that of 

58
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,450
Russia were in just 20 years.
Between 1991 and 2011.

59
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,313
Then we're at 13 point one,
three more deaths than there were 

60
00:03:48,651 --> 00:03:51,230
births.
Future projections show that in the next

61
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:53,750
50 years,
Europe's native population will decrease

62
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:56,360
fire rounds.
One hundred million people.

63
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,340
No,

64
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,353
just that the other effect of this 
entire process is that the world's 

65
00:04:03,001 --> 00:04:03,834
population,
especially if out of the most developed 

66
00:04:05,161 --> 00:04:08,280
countries is aging at full speed and 
that my friends,

67
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:10,830
it's posing many,
many challenges,

68
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,450
pensions,
healthcare expenses,

69
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,310
dependence,
and the question is now,

70
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:15,173
how on earth can we finance this 
gigantic expense to give you an idea of 

71
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:19,524
what we're talking about here is 
estimated that in many European 

72
00:04:21,091 --> 00:04:23,850
countries,
the percentage of the population over 65

73
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:24,684
years old will be around 40 percent by 
2050 and one of those most effected 

74
00:04:28,561 --> 00:04:33,561
countries is actually Spain.
So listen up country of retired people.

75
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:45,330
Here's an exercise for you.
Let's assume that fertility in Spain and

76
00:04:45,331 --> 00:04:46,164
the European Union remains within the 
rates that they've had since the year 

77
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,050
2000 and that's in addition.
No immigrants arrive.

78
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,730
You want to know what's going to happen?
Well,

79
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,720
check out the following week,

80
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:55,653
Ralph

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,710
and see if the population aged between 
18 and 40 years,

82
00:05:00,711 --> 00:05:01,544
which is the population that works the 
most and the population that has the 

83
00:05:03,471 --> 00:05:05,990
most children.
That's going to take a huge dip.

84
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:07,790
Of course,
the number of inhabitants,

85
00:05:07,791 --> 00:05:10,000
just a decade later that followed the 
same trap.

86
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,473
Spain is one of the countries that's 
beginning to suffer the most from this 

87
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:20,950
demographic crisis.
The demographic crisis is getting worse.

88
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:24,490
Spain suffers it's biggest population 
loss in 2017.

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,730
If we take a look at the average number 
of children per women,

90
00:05:27,731 --> 00:05:28,564
we can truly understand what was going 
on here and this is taking into account 

91
00:05:41,251 --> 00:05:45,390
that the arrival of immigrants in the 
last 20 years has boosted birthrates.

92
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:46,283
Nowadays,
23 percent of all children born in 

93
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,790
Spain,
almost one in four have a foreign

94
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:55,820
mother fucker boss.

95
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,173
The most important data to predict 
what's going to happen will come from 

96
00:06:00,341 --> 00:06:03,430
looking at how the number of people of 
working age will evolve.

97
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,480
They after all other ones who generate 
the vast majority of resources,

98
00:06:07,481 --> 00:06:08,910
both public and private.
Well,

99
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:12,430
if we assume that there's no immigration
in just 30 years,

100
00:06:12,431 --> 00:06:16,000
the working age population would 
decrease by 10 million people.

101
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:16,853
It's according to the projections of the
Institute of Statistics of the 

102
00:06:19,151 --> 00:06:19,984
government of Spain.
Spaniards will face this panorama by 

103
00:06:22,331 --> 00:06:23,210
2015.

104
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,433
Okay.

105
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,320
30 million people of working age,
all of whom,

106
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:32,370
of course not a world work and almost 22
million children and retirees.

107
00:06:32,430 --> 00:06:33,263
That is the dependent population would 
be greater than the working age 

108
00:06:36,121 --> 00:06:36,954
population.
Yeah.

109
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:43,440
Now we're talking about Spain 
specifically here,

110
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:46,590
but this scenario is very familiar to 
most developed countries.

111
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,410
As you can imagine,
all of this has many consequences.

112
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,853
The consequences in recent times there's
been a lot of talk about the risk of 

113
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:04,193
automation,
but perhaps the most imminent risk that 

114
00:07:06,331 --> 00:07:09,960
developed countries have to face is that
quick aging process.

115
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:13,023
At the end of the day,
it's clear that an agent population has 

116
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:17,260
several consequences.
For one,

117
00:07:17,290 --> 00:07:19,360
it's foreseeable that if nothing 
changes,

118
00:07:19,361 --> 00:07:22,210
public spending will skyrockets to pay 
pensions,

119
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,750
healthcare expenses assistance,
and Kathy,

120
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:26,950
the elderly,
among many other things.

121
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:32,440
Pension spending increases by 50 percent
in Spain in 10 years,

122
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,363
and no doubt,
this will be very clear as a politician 

123
00:07:35,001 --> 00:07:35,834
and sleep hygiene,
many have retired voters will be 

124
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:40,480
overwhelming.
It's simply a matter of votes,

125
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:46,280
but at the same time as we've seen,
there are going to be off.

126
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:47,114
You are working age people,
so the question is how on earth are we 

127
00:07:49,631 --> 00:07:50,464
going to pay for this huge expense?
Will the already high taxes be raised 

128
00:07:53,891 --> 00:07:54,724
even further damaging the 
competitiveness of countries with as 

129
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:59,800
many economic problems as Spain or 
perhaps Italy?

130
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,870
Well,
the reality is that's a recipe that just

131
00:08:01,871 --> 00:08:03,280
doesn't work.
Now at this point,

132
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:05,440
I think we need to answer a mandatory 
question.

133
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:07,120
Well,
what the hell can we do?

134
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:15,250
We need a plan.

135
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,000
I know

136
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,860
and politicians don't usually like to 
think about the future.

137
00:08:20,861 --> 00:08:24,610
Especially future problems probably goes
a little something like this.

138
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:25,473
What I need to think about problems that
will happen in 20 years from now when 

139
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:29,800
the risk losing votes.
No,

140
00:08:29,801 --> 00:08:30,071
no,
no,

141
00:08:30,071 --> 00:08:30,311
no,
no,

142
00:08:30,311 --> 00:08:31,000
no,
no.

143
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,440
Let someone else take care of that.
Well,

144
00:08:32,441 --> 00:08:34,660
if we don't want to see headlines like 
this developed,

145
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,494
countries are going to need a plan.
Japan's finance minister tells elderly 

146
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:44,350
they should hurry up and die to help 
reduce countries rising.

147
00:08:44,351 --> 00:08:45,184
Welfare bill.
The time to make decisions is now in 

148
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:51,640
countries that decide to look the other 
way and do nothing will face many,

149
00:08:51,790 --> 00:08:56,790
many problems in the future.
You see lately here on visual politic,

150
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:02,090
we've talked a lot about immigration.
While experience tells us that this is a

151
00:09:02,091 --> 00:09:06,590
good way to stop population aging and 
buy time to make new reform.

152
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:09,890
As Australia,
Hong Kong,

153
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:10,783
New Zealand and Singapore have shown 
integration can soften the blow from 

154
00:09:13,851 --> 00:09:15,590
rapid aging.
Sean Young Rhee,

155
00:09:15,650 --> 00:09:19,850
director of Asia Pacific Department at 
the International Monetary Fund.

156
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:22,660
Yes.
Despite many politicians discourse,

157
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:23,583
the truth is that developed countries 
will need many people to arrive from 

158
00:09:26,741 --> 00:09:27,880
abroad,
so folks,

159
00:09:27,881 --> 00:09:30,820
instead of thinking about building walls
and closing borders,

160
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:31,654
it would be much more advisable to start
a system that manages to attract people 

161
00:09:35,231 --> 00:09:39,370
from outside in an orderly fashion and 
facilitates the integration,

162
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,233
but of course that's not all as public 
pension systems will almost certainly 

163
00:09:46,851 --> 00:09:49,810
become much less generous because they 
won't have as much of a budget.

164
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:50,683
Governments should also be promoting 
saving both from the governments 

165
00:09:53,691 --> 00:09:55,730
themselves and from families.

166
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,393
Any Spanish political party warning 
citizens of the next cut in their 

167
00:10:02,061 --> 00:10:03,350
pensions.
No,

168
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,390
they're all silent about our true 
future,

169
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:06,283
giving a false impression that one 
doesn't need to save to guarantee a 

170
00:10:09,441 --> 00:10:11,590
fairly dignified retirement.
Quander,

171
00:10:11,591 --> 00:10:15,710
I'm on an IO economist and director of 
the one day Marianna Institute,

172
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:16,703
and along with all of this,
of course governments should promote 

173
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,473
policies that attract companies that 
promote entrepreneurship and the bubble 

174
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,103
that favor productivity investments in 
machines and technology and in research 

175
00:10:26,920 --> 00:10:28,120
and developments.
Yes,

176
00:10:28,121 --> 00:10:31,180
I think robots are actually going to 
greatly help with this problem.

177
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:37,330
Unfortunately,
in many of the affected countries,

178
00:10:37,331 --> 00:10:39,610
including Spain,
nothing has been done.

179
00:10:39,730 --> 00:10:42,670
And finally before we finish,
I'd like to throw out an idea.

180
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:46,780
See,
the effects of aging is accompanied by a

181
00:10:46,781 --> 00:10:48,910
longevity effects.
I want me to explain this.

182
00:10:48,940 --> 00:10:52,720
Thanks to medical advances that 
nutrition into quality of life mortality

183
00:10:52,721 --> 00:10:53,554
rates for all ages,
so have decreased that his people a 

184
00:10:56,140 --> 00:11:00,710
younger for long see in the United 
States.

185
00:11:00,711 --> 00:11:01,544
For example,
the 75 year old person has the same 

186
00:11:03,201 --> 00:11:08,120
mortality rate today as a 65 year old 
person had in the 19 fifties in Japan.

187
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:09,860
80 is the new 65

188
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,060
and also thanks to medical and 
technological advances,

189
00:11:15,061 --> 00:11:17,190
this evolution,
it continues to grow and grow,

190
00:11:17,191 --> 00:11:19,500
which the humanity is fantastic.
Therefore,

191
00:11:19,501 --> 00:11:22,170
if people have a longer,
more productive life,

192
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:23,004
wouldn't it be wise to encourage them to
continue working for longer and you've 

193
00:11:26,031 --> 00:11:26,864
even partially or in more comfortable 
roles and that's where I'm going to 

194
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:31,710
leave today's video,
but now it's your turn.

195
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,920
Would you be in favor of increasing your
country's retirement age?

196
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:35,793
