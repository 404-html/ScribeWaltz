1
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:11,380
Totally before being fired on twitter at
Secretary of state,

2
00:00:11,381 --> 00:00:13,570
rex Tillerson,
the former US diplomat,

3
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:14,463
has concluded his first tour of Latin 
America was the first official trip a 

4
00:00:27,161 --> 00:00:30,370
senior officer from the trump 
administration had taken to the region.

5
00:00:30,371 --> 00:00:33,880
Though a few months ago in the summer of
2017 the vice president's himself,

6
00:00:33,881 --> 00:00:37,720
Mike Pence had his own Latin American 
talk in which he visited Panama,

7
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:38,950
Colombia,
Argentina,

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:39,873
and Chile.
I think we all know that the 

9
00:00:45,921 --> 00:00:50,090
relationship between the United States 
and Latin America is very,

10
00:00:50,091 --> 00:00:52,760
very,
should we say special.

11
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:53,594
And by special we mean not very good.
And I'm not just saying this because 

12
00:00:56,631 --> 00:00:59,720
there are about 60 million Hispanics 
living in the United States,

13
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:01,460
but also because of historical 
precedents,

14
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:03,650
commercial ties,
and many,

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:08,800
many security issues.
Without going any further,

16
00:01:12,851 --> 00:01:16,240
one out of every four US trade dollars 
ends up in this region.

17
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:17,103
However,
the vice presidents and the former 

18
00:01:17,981 --> 00:01:21,400
secretary of state's toilets left in 
many with the feeling in the eyes of the

19
00:01:21,401 --> 00:01:25,090
trump administration.
Latin America is more of a nuisance than

20
00:01:25,091 --> 00:01:30,091
an opportunity,
and this might actually be softening the

21
00:01:31,711 --> 00:01:32,544
blow.
Considering everything that trump has 

22
00:01:33,721 --> 00:01:36,510
said since he announced that he would 
run four presidents,

23
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:38,220
when Mexico sends its people,

24
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:41,380
well,
they're not sending their best no more,

25
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,153
no more naps.
Alan Bray Dead Pedelec when we're going 

26
00:01:47,631 --> 00:01:49,660
to build the wall,
we have no choice.

27
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,553
We have no choice

28
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:55,510
to describe the relationship between the
United States and Latin America today.

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,373
We could say that the United States is 
kind of like that friend who demands 

30
00:01:59,021 --> 00:02:01,570
loads of things from you.
But when the situations reversed,

31
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,433
they won't do anything for you.
A pretty good example of this is the 

32
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:06,124
pretty surreal Mike Pence store.
It's all that had practically no 

33
00:02:09,311 --> 00:02:10,144
objectives and to which the vice 
president seemed to be more concerned 

34
00:02:12,191 --> 00:02:13,024
with trying to prevent the insignificant
commercial relations between Chile and 

35
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:17,224
North Korea,
or maybe trying to get the origin zines 

36
00:02:18,761 --> 00:02:20,890
to buy pork from his State,
Indiana.

37
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:21,753
He didn't seem to have much of a focus 
on actual international relations 

38
00:02:24,701 --> 00:02:27,760
between the United States and Latin 
America.

39
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,630
Uh,
I come from an agricultural state in the

40
00:02:38,631 --> 00:02:39,464
United States.
I was governor of the state of Indiana 

41
00:02:40,851 --> 00:02:43,200
before I became vice president.
Uh,

42
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:45,880
and um,
I know the,

43
00:02:45,881 --> 00:02:48,380
uh,
the quality of American pork.

44
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:57,730
You

45
00:02:57,730 --> 00:02:58,940
know,
it was China,

46
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,490
Xi Jinping's China.
Well,

47
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,490
they're on the lookouts.
So in the video today,

48
00:03:03,491 --> 00:03:07,130
we're going to see what he wants.
What does Donald Trump expects from mass

49
00:03:07,131 --> 00:03:08,440
in America and also,
well,

50
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:11,020
what's happening with China.
But first,

51
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:16,230
let's look back at the history America 
for North Americans,

52
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,560
1823,
the then president of the United States,

53
00:03:25,590 --> 00:03:26,423
James Monroe,
launched what would later be known as 

54
00:03:28,531 --> 00:03:32,060
the Monroe Doctrine America for the 
Americans or they,

55
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:34,470
with time,
this is become more like America for the

56
00:03:34,471 --> 00:03:35,304
North Americans see this doctrine,
this policy defended the claim that the 

57
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,084
European states had no right to 
intervene in American affairs or in the 

58
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:45,390
countries that were becoming independent
at the time from Spain.

59
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:48,450
At that time,
the U S was protecting Latin America and

60
00:03:48,451 --> 00:03:51,390
defending non-intervention,
which sounds pretty good,

61
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,020
right?
Well,

62
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,930
just wait a moment here because that is 
certainly a problem.

63
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:55,793
Well,
this doctrine led Washington's do 

64
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:57,804
practically everything in Latin America.
We're a region that has since become 

65
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:05,241
known as the u s his back yard.
Oh yes.

66
00:04:09,321 --> 00:04:11,600
Since James Monro launched this 
perspective,

67
00:04:11,601 --> 00:04:14,750
the United States has set up,
governments has overthrown,

68
00:04:14,751 --> 00:04:16,820
governments,
has financed gorillas,

69
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:19,390
has financed armies,
has bought politicians,

70
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:20,233
has negotiated with drug traffickers,
has managed to legitimize q to task and 

71
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:27,560
has committed many more actions aimed at
depending on the time period,

72
00:04:27,561 --> 00:04:28,394
either at fighting communism or 
defending other interests such as some 

73
00:04:31,641 --> 00:04:36,641
big oil sector multinational now.
Yes,

74
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:44,060
of course.
Some good things have also been done,

75
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:46,160
especially in recent years when the 
more,

76
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:47,023
let's say opaque relations gave way to a
strategy from Washington that focused 

77
00:04:50,901 --> 00:04:53,240
more on resolving internal conflict.

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,833
Yes.

79
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:57,853
Was the case for example with Bill 
Clinton's Columbia plan or George Bush 

80
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:01,784
is trade promotion strategy,
which led him to sign no less than 10 

81
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,713
new free trade agreements with Latin 
American countries and to even propose 

82
00:05:08,521 --> 00:05:12,200
for all of America to become a large 
free trade area.

83
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,280
They even say relations between Latin 
America and the United States.

84
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,190
They've always been very peculiar.
You see,

85
00:05:21,220 --> 00:05:22,053
due to the Monroe doctrine,
Washington has always felt like a legal 

86
00:05:24,461 --> 00:05:27,070
guardian who can decide what's right,
what's wrong,

87
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,710
what's advisable,
and Watson not advisable.

88
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:32,800
However,
the results haven't been very positive.

89
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:39,400
[inaudible]

90
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:45,790
is it over again now since Donald Trump 
entered the white house.

91
00:05:45,791 --> 00:05:50,110
So let's see what the presidents of the 
United States of Latin America wants,

92
00:05:50,111 --> 00:05:52,480
what he expects and what we can expect.

93
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:00,440
What does Donald Trump want

94
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,480
now is not going to surprise anyone 
watching this video that Donald Trump is

95
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:07,314
not exactly in Latin America's best 
friend who seemingly has very little 

96
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:13,710
concern for the region except Cuba,
Venezuela and above all,

97
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:16,080
well Mexico.
In fact,

98
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:16,973
trump has so little interest in Latin 
America that one year into his 

99
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,050
presidency at the time of making this 
video,

100
00:06:22,051 --> 00:06:22,884
he still hasn't appointed someone for 
the Assistant Secretary of State for 

101
00:06:25,841 --> 00:06:26,674
Western Hispanic Affairs.
This is the person specifically 

102
00:06:29,221 --> 00:06:30,054
responsible for diplomacy with Latin 
America and it's quite unusual that it 

103
00:06:32,941 --> 00:06:35,130
hasn't yet appointed anyone to this 
position.

104
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:37,813
That is not to see that his lack of 
interest hasn't made the region 

105
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,264
something of a play thing for him.
Nor does it mean that he doesn't expect 

106
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,380
anything from them.
Well,

107
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:45,981
I,
let me,

108
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:46,814
let me explain this.
Trump's first year has been marked with 

109
00:06:49,011 --> 00:06:49,844
insults to Mexico,
mostly due to his obsession with 

110
00:06:51,561 --> 00:06:53,000
building that wall.
Oh,

111
00:06:53,001 --> 00:06:56,780
and he's also threatened to Columbia,
which is something we're going to get to

112
00:06:56,810 --> 00:07:01,810
in a moment.
It may be through reimbursement,

113
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,890
but one way or the other,
Mexico will pay for the world.

114
00:07:04,510 --> 00:07:06,580
That wall,
build that wall,

115
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:09,460
build that wall,
build that wall,

116
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,250
build that wall,
build that wall,

117
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,250
build that wall,
build that wall.

118
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:20,000
I love the Mexican people.
I have such a great relationship to make

119
00:07:20,001 --> 00:07:24,460
sure I hire thousands people.
The Rich Mexicans,

120
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:25,930
they're great people.
Friends of mine,

121
00:07:25,931 --> 00:07:27,580
they buy my apartments.
Ah,

122
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:30,670
well how about some more examples?
Now listen to this.

123
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,930
In 2017 as we saw here on visual 
politics,

124
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:35,793
trump moved away from Obama's openness 
towards Cuba without really proposing 

125
00:07:39,911 --> 00:07:40,744
any sort of alternative.
Also back in the worst customs of 

126
00:07:42,731 --> 00:07:43,564
Western diplomacy in Latin America.
He legitimized and supported the very 

127
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:47,194
suspicious reelection of one Orlando 
Hernandez in Honduras and most recently 

128
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:54,304
in 2018 is government decided to suspend
these so called temporary protected 

129
00:07:57,401 --> 00:07:58,234
status for Nicaragua and Honduran 
Haitian and above all Salvadoran 

130
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:03,280
immigrants.
And listen because with this decision,

131
00:08:03,310 --> 00:08:05,740
200,000
immigrants from El Salvador.

132
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,270
Yes,
200,000

133
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:11,230
we'll have to leave the United States or
simply become illegal immigrants.

134
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:12,693
We had hoped that if we worked hard,
paid our taxes and didn't get in 

135
00:08:15,131 --> 00:08:16,930
trouble,
will you be allowed to stay?

136
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:17,913
Veronica lacunas 39 a Salvadoran who has
two children born in the United States 

137
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:25,570
and these are just a few examples.
The list is really rather long.

138
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,230
Perhaps that is why trump's popularity 
in the region is so,

139
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,160
so low and when we say so,
so low,

140
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:33,400
we really mean it is just totally on the
floor.

141
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:34,943
I mean check it out.
In 2017 Gallup asked Lassen American 

142
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,340
citizens for their opinion on president 
trump.

143
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,370
Only 16% had a positive opinion.
The folks,

144
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,333
here's an important question.
The question that we really need to ask 

145
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:48,934
ourselves is,
does all this offense does all this 

146
00:08:51,581 --> 00:08:52,414
poking in the,
I mean that trump doesn't want anything 

147
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:57,660
from Latin America and the answer that 
is not a tall,

148
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,480
his government is demanding several 
things from the regions,

149
00:09:00,481 --> 00:09:01,314
countries,
especially the following three 

150
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,670
unconditional support for his foreign 
policy,

151
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:13,504
including his policy on Venezuela,
seconds for people to renounce or curb 

152
00:09:16,961 --> 00:09:21,010
China's influence and third for them to 
take the blame for everything.

153
00:09:21,011 --> 00:09:21,844
Either by paying for the wall or by 
assuming more responsibilities in the 

154
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:26,920
fight against drug trafficking.
Now,

155
00:09:26,921 --> 00:09:28,380
okay.
Except for China in the world,

156
00:09:28,381 --> 00:09:31,630
the other demands could really be taken 
as actually being pretty reasonable.

157
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,160
Do you know what the real problem is

158
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,013
here is

159
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:43,400
the trump administration never put any 
alternatives on the table.

160
00:09:43,430 --> 00:09:44,263
They don't seem very willing to give 
anything in return and they do 

161
00:09:46,161 --> 00:09:46,994
everything under the,
you're either with me or against me 

162
00:09:48,951 --> 00:09:49,784
approach.
And the truth is that if we want Latin 

163
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:53,930
America to change,
evolve to prosper,

164
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:56,900
it needs support and it needs 
opportunities.

165
00:09:56,930 --> 00:09:59,270
Like for example,
more trade opportunities.

166
00:09:59,300 --> 00:10:03,110
That was another republican president.
George Bush has precise strategy and the

167
00:10:03,111 --> 00:10:05,540
results were actually pretty good,
but okay.

168
00:10:05,570 --> 00:10:06,650
Now you might be thinking,
well,

169
00:10:06,651 --> 00:10:07,484
come on assignment.
Surely trump has also proposed some 

170
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:10,970
positive things,
right.

171
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,250
Well,
I really think to answer that question,

172
00:10:13,310 --> 00:10:17,570
we need to see how trump is treating the
u s is best allies in the room.

173
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:22,740
[inaudible]

174
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:26,500
brands

175
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,920
[inaudible]

176
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:33,010
you can say without fear of being wrong,
but Colombia,

177
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:35,470
Honduras and Mexico have traditionally 
been,

178
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,430
the u s is best allies in Latin America 
and you know what?

179
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:42,100
With trump in the White House,
it's not really helping very much.

180
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:42,963
Check out the statements that trump made
by rex tillerson was on tour trying to 

181
00:10:45,491 --> 00:10:50,230
strengthen ties with the Latin America.
These countries are not our friends.

182
00:10:50,260 --> 00:10:51,093
We think there our friends and we sent 
the massive aid and I won't mention 

183
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:54,454
names right now.
We send them massive aid and they're 

184
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:58,360
pouring drugs into our country and 
they're laughing at us.

185
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,830
Donald Trump,
yes,

186
00:10:59,831 --> 00:11:01,270
trump.
He doesn't give out any names,

187
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:03,610
but there's little doubt.
He was referring to Mexico,

188
00:11:03,611 --> 00:11:05,080
Colombia,
Honduras,

189
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:07,780
and brew in Mexico.
He mentioned the wall.

190
00:11:07,781 --> 00:11:08,614
He mentioned the Nafta renegotiation.
There have been constant attacks since 

191
00:11:11,831 --> 00:11:12,664
trump announced his candidacy and do you
know how people feel about trump in 

192
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:17,261
Mexico?
Will,

193
00:11:17,261 --> 00:11:19,240
according to polls,
it's 1.6

194
00:11:19,241 --> 00:11:22,540
points out of 10 does also take a look 
now at Columbia,

195
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:23,403
the country that by far has historically
had the best relationship with the u s 

196
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:33,290
yeah,
it might surprise you,

197
00:11:33,291 --> 00:11:37,250
but Columbia was actually the only Latin
American country that sent troops to the

198
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,083
Korean War.
It also supported the United States and 

199
00:11:39,141 --> 00:11:42,650
the 2003 invasion of Iraq and this 
country's policies.

200
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,410
It's pretty much always aligned with 
Washington's interests.

201
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,390
These have been created policies towards
Cuba.

202
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:48,283
China.

203
00:11:50,980 --> 00:11:51,300
Wow.
Well,

204
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,133
not even that's prevented from 
threatened ms country by considering it 

205
00:11:55,270 --> 00:11:56,103
noncooperative with the fulfillment of 
international requirements in the fight 

206
00:11:58,931 --> 00:11:59,764
against drug trafficking.
This is something that could have a 

207
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:04,180
serious economic and political 
consequences.

208
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:05,823
It isn't only treating an ally who's 
trying to solve the problem in a rude 

209
00:12:08,441 --> 00:12:10,480
way.
It's also a great mistake.

210
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:12,940
He's sending a toxic message to the rest
of the region.

211
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,863
Even if you do what the u s asks,
if they disagree with part of your 

212
00:12:16,091 --> 00:12:17,740
strategy,
they will act against you.

213
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:18,723
Adam Isaacson coordinator up a 
Washington Office for Latin American 

214
00:12:21,251 --> 00:12:22,150
affairs.
Yes,

215
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,013
it is true.
The coca production has rebounded in 

216
00:12:24,851 --> 00:12:25,684
Columbia and that the country hasn't 
been able to beat the drug trafficking 

217
00:12:28,300 --> 00:12:31,270
that's threatening the country that has 
suffered the most from the war on drugs,

218
00:12:31,271 --> 00:12:34,630
threatening the only country that has 
managed to improve the situation.

219
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,493
As I mean on top of that,
he's doing it without proposing any 

220
00:12:37,481 --> 00:12:38,314
alternative.

221
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:41,320
We've lost.
Our best leaders are best journalists,

222
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:44,470
are best judges,
are best police in the war on drugs.

223
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:45,363
Juan Manuel Santos,
President of Columbia and is regarding 

224
00:12:47,681 --> 00:12:48,514
Honduras and other great ally.
What we've already told you here on 

225
00:12:50,741 --> 00:12:55,210
visual politic about Juan Orlando 
Hernandez is very probable q and even in

226
00:12:55,211 --> 00:12:56,044
Argentina,
a country that is rapidly changing 

227
00:12:57,311 --> 00:12:59,590
something that Washington should 
logically acts upon.

228
00:12:59,620 --> 00:13:01,180
Well,
they're not even acting then.

229
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:05,230
Trump demands a lot from Latin America,
but he really isn't willing to give much

230
00:13:05,231 --> 00:13:07,390
in return,
not even to the United States,

231
00:13:07,391 --> 00:13:10,660
his best friends in the region,
and China knows it.

232
00:13:16,950 --> 00:13:17,783
Right?

233
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:19,920
Does pursuit,

234
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:23,080
okay.

235
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:27,160
China and the Chinese influence in the 
region is becoming a great obsession for

236
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,053
the United States.
Rex tillerson himself use the monroe 

237
00:13:30,161 --> 00:13:30,994
doctrine to see that the United States 
has the right to block the interference 

238
00:13:33,941 --> 00:13:37,760
of another power in America.
But the question is,

239
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:41,210
who gave the United States government 
that power in the first place?

240
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,853
Latin America does not need new imperial
powers that seek only to benefit their 

241
00:13:46,250 --> 00:13:48,830
own people.
Rex tillerson allow me to explain this.

242
00:13:48,831 --> 00:13:49,664
Latin American countries have all the 
rights in the wells to seek other 

243
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,420
alliances,
other markets,

244
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:56,160
and other investments.
And if those are Chinese,

245
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,950
so the u s department of State should 
ask itself is how is it possible that Xi

246
00:14:03,950 --> 00:14:07,250
Jingping has visited the region more 
times in the last five years?

247
00:14:07,310 --> 00:14:09,500
Then the presidents of the United 
States,

248
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:11,330
both Obama and trump

249
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:14,110
hold it.

250
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:14,943
China is willing to promote trade 
agreements and investments while trump 

251
00:14:17,741 --> 00:14:20,440
is determines to punish Mexico,
build walls,

252
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,363
and restricts trade.
A great example of this is the shutting 

253
00:14:23,111 --> 00:14:25,870
down of the TPP,
the largest trade agreements in history,

254
00:14:25,900 --> 00:14:27,730
which includes among other countries,
Mexico,

255
00:14:27,731 --> 00:14:28,750
Peru,
and Chile.

256
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:31,900
See in the last Latin American and 
Caribbean states community meeting,

257
00:14:31,901 --> 00:14:32,734
China announced it would invest $250 
billion in the region in the next 

258
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,703
decade.
If the United States wants to maintain 

259
00:14:39,641 --> 00:14:43,390
its power and its influence and continue
to determine the political agenda,

260
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,253
perhaps it should include looking after 
Latin America's interests in its 

261
00:14:47,501 --> 00:14:49,720
political strategy,
but now it's your turn.

262
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:50,583
On a scale from one to five,
how would you assess the USS influence 

263
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,320
in Latin America?
Well,

264
