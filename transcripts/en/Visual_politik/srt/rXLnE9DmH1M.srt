1
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:11,550
Japan a country that brags about two 
things.

2
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:14,730
The first is the used underwear vending 
machines,

3
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:17,370
which yes,
you really can find on the streets,

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:18,263
and the second is the immigration rates,
which is by far the lowest in the 

5
00:00:21,391 --> 00:00:24,450
developed world for comparison in the 
United States.

6
00:00:24,451 --> 00:00:26,910
The immigrant population is about 14 
percent.

7
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,420
Canada and New Zealand's have 20 and 25 
percent respectively.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:34,830
And then this Japan with an immigration 
population of less than two percent.

9
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:44,280
What's the reason for this?
Well,

10
00:00:44,281 --> 00:00:47,700
quite simply it's they're very 
restrictive immigration system.

11
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:48,593
This makes Japan something of a dream 
country for politicians like Donald 

12
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:53,213
Trump or marine le pen.
If there is one word that could define 

13
00:00:55,471 --> 00:00:59,190
the current political debate,
that word would be immigration.

14
00:00:59,310 --> 00:01:00,143
In Europe,
countries are arguing about what to do 

15
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:02,394
with refugees and it seems the 
politicians across the board seemed to 

16
00:01:05,221 --> 00:01:08,250
think that immigration is a problem that
needs to be stopped.

17
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,193
Immigration has fallen under this 
government and we've cut net migration 

18
00:01:11,241 --> 00:01:12,074
by a third.

19
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:12,943
Anyone who illegally crosses the border 
will be detained until they are removed 

20
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:23,160
out of our country and back to the 
country from which they came.

21
00:01:23,770 --> 00:01:24,603
Since I took office,
we've deployed more border agents and 

22
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:31,570
technology to our southern border than 
ever before,

23
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,250
so then Japan is a perfect example of 
what our country would look like without

24
00:01:36,251 --> 00:01:37,084
really many immigrants at all,
and so now you might be wondering what 

25
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:41,950
exactly does that mean for Japan's 
economy?

26
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,843
Do they really save money because they 
don't have to spend on social policies 

27
00:01:45,671 --> 00:01:46,504
for immigrants further deep Japanese 
work as enjoy a higher standard of life 

28
00:01:49,961 --> 00:01:52,960
because they don't have to compete for 
jobs with foreign workers.

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,050
Hands on this episode of visual politics

30
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,370
going to be answering those questions.
Before we get into all of that,

31
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:02,700
we need to have a close look at Japan's 
immigration law.

32
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,143
Yeah,

33
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:08,620
country one culture,
one race.

34
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:09,483
This statement was said by the man who 
was the prime minister of Japan in the 

35
00:02:12,370 --> 00:02:15,380
mid 19 eighties.
Viceman was Yasuhiro Naca.

36
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,090
The Statesman's clearly summarizes the 
immigration policy of Japan.

37
00:02:19,091 --> 00:02:23,200
Basically there are two ways to get into
the land of the rising sun.

38
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:27,100
One is where they work contracts and the
other is with a tourist visa.

39
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:29,380
If a company wants to hire you from 
overseas,

40
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,214
you will need a work visa and the only 
possible way that you can get that visa 

41
00:02:33,131 --> 00:02:33,964
is do you have a university degree or 
have some specific skills that are 

42
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:39,910
practically impossible to find in the 
Japanese labor markets,

43
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,010
so if you are just to construction 
worker,

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:44,740
you are never going to get a work permit
for Japan.

45
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:47,680
That is,
unless you use this other program

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,790
on Japan,
didn't have a lot to accept workers from

47
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:56,550
other Asian countries like Vietnam or 
Philippines.

48
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:00,940
They graded the so called technical 
internal training program.

49
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:04,300
This in summary is sort of like being an
intern in Japan,

50
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:08,090
except you get about half the salary.
There's a Japanese in turn would get not

51
00:03:08,091 --> 00:03:08,924
only that,
but with this technical internal 

52
00:03:10,071 --> 00:03:10,904
training program,
your boss has even allowed to hold onto 

53
00:03:12,621 --> 00:03:15,290
your passport and access your bank 
accounts.

54
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:18,500
More worryingly than that.
Since they started this program,

55
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:21,620
thousands of Asian immigrants have 
simply disappeared.

56
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,923
For

57
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,880
when the Union Representative I spoke 
with me,

58
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:29,013
she said that my attitude was bad and 
that if I continue to have this heavy 

59
00:03:32,561 --> 00:03:35,740
dude,
if my actions continued her friend,

60
00:03:35,741 --> 00:03:38,340
we'll hire a hitman to kill channel.

61
00:03:39,460 --> 00:03:40,293
So well,
what if you ended up with a tourist 

62
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:42,551
visa?
Well,

63
00:03:42,551 --> 00:03:45,880
in that case you can stand the country 
for a year and a half as long as you can

64
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,720
prove that you are studying Japanese.
Once that initial time has passed,

65
00:03:49,721 --> 00:03:50,554
you need to get hired by a company.
This could lead to you getting a work 

66
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:54,184
visa,
but do watch out here because unlike in 

67
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:57,670
the United States or certain European 
countries,

68
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:01,330
this work visa stipulates what your 
profession is.

69
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:02,283
So for example,
if you get that work visa saying that 

70
00:04:04,331 --> 00:04:05,164
you are a chef,
then you could only work in a 

71
00:04:07,061 --> 00:04:07,894
restaurant.
If you break this rule and do some sort 

72
00:04:09,521 --> 00:04:10,354
of other work,
then the government will not renew your 

73
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:12,784
visa.
There is only one really effective way 

74
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:16,060
for a foreign.
So you make a living in Japan,

75
00:04:16,270 --> 00:04:17,103
the most part thing to get the was like 
the easiest thing to live here is 

76
00:04:19,491 --> 00:04:21,500
marrying a Japanese person.

77
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:22,503
Now I heard you can understand why in a 
country with over 127 million 

78
00:04:27,161 --> 00:04:30,370
inhabitants,
I need 2 million of them are immigrants,

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,270
but what consequences does this have on 
the daily lives of Japanese citizens?

80
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,110
He's a Japanese pensions.

81
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,860
Japan is the oldest country in the 
world,

82
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:45,783
not because of that long history,
but because of the actual physical age 

83
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:51,330
of their population.
In fact estimation save.

84
00:04:51,331 --> 00:04:52,164
It's in the next 90 years,
they're going to lose about 44 million 

85
00:04:55,061 --> 00:04:55,894
people from their population,
which is about the entire population of 

86
00:04:59,291 --> 00:05:00,124
Canada and now this wouldn't be a 
problem if it wasn't for these social 

87
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:05,860
security system.
As you probably know the pen.

88
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:06,783
As you know,
the pension system in most countries in 

89
00:05:08,201 --> 00:05:11,470
the world works in the following way.
The people who are working today are the

90
00:05:11,471 --> 00:05:14,530
ones who are paying the pensions of the 
people who are retired today.

91
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,980
As the workforce gets smaller and 
smaller night,

92
00:05:16,990 --> 00:05:17,823
year after year,
the number of people paying those 

93
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:23,470
pensions is getting smaller.
Further on the other side of things,

94
00:05:23,471 --> 00:05:26,460
more and more people are retiring who 
are drawing more ends,

95
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,220
more social security,
and this leads to problems like this.

96
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:31,163
Yes,

97
00:05:33,350 --> 00:05:37,820
social security contributions cover only
60 percent of these benefits,

98
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,180
the remaining 40 trillion jen comes from
taxes or more precisely public deficits

99
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:49,733
way.
The music you're hearing in this video 

100
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:51,724
is from the Spanish band Mescalina if 
you like it and want to check out more 

101
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:57,010
of their stuff and do you look in the 
description box?

102
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:09,280
Why pay attention to this mosque?
Japan has the highest public debt of any

103
00:06:10,141 --> 00:06:10,974
country in the world.
Their current debt level is more than 

104
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:16,920
double the GDP and to their fiscal 
deficits.

105
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,783
The difference between the income and 
this spending is higher than the one in 

106
00:06:20,821 --> 00:06:23,030
the United States.
In other words,

107
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:26,180
if Angela Merkel where to go to Japan,
she had probably get very,

108
00:06:26,181 --> 00:06:28,340
very angry.
So like now you might be wondering,

109
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,174
well,
what does all of this have to do with 

110
00:06:29,751 --> 00:06:31,040
integration?
Well,

111
00:06:31,041 --> 00:06:33,290
the answer is a lot.
You see,

112
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:36,900
we've all heard about how expensive it 
is to integrate immigrants.

113
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:40,350
You have to pay for social programs,
integration courses,

114
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,193
etc. Etc.
But no onE really talks about how much 

115
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:44,540
are you native citizens costs.

116
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,930
Yup.

117
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,593
For an example,
an american Born citizen costs the 

118
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:51,504
government $150,000 by the time age 16,
and this is only for education and 

119
00:06:58,111 --> 00:07:00,570
health care depending on the state that 
that person lives in.

120
00:07:00,571 --> 00:07:01,404
You minds have to add in other expenses,
but the government sees all of this as 

121
00:07:03,871 --> 00:07:06,720
an investment because when that person 
stops paying taxes,

122
00:07:06,950 --> 00:07:09,390
they're going to get that money back.
On the other hand,

123
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:12,300
let's take an example of a vietnamese 
immigrants to Japan.

124
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,193
He comes to the country when he is old 
enough to start whacking his education 

125
00:07:15,931 --> 00:07:20,931
and healthcare was already paid for by 
the vehicle average of two years.

126
00:07:23,361 --> 00:07:26,180
That'd be in the knees.
Immigrants is going to find a job.

127
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:26,901
Now,
of course,

128
00:07:26,901 --> 00:07:30,170
that might be a low page one and you 
might pay just a little tax,

129
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:33,320
but the japanese government didn't have 
to invest any money in,

130
00:07:33,590 --> 00:07:35,150
so in other words,
immigrant,

131
00:07:35,151 --> 00:07:36,860
so free cash,
but the government,

132
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,753
since Japan has so few immigrants,
they are losing out on this easy influx 

133
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:42,583
of cash.
this is why in the middle of a fiscal 

134
00:07:44,211 --> 00:07:48,170
crisis in 2015,
the japanese prime minister shinzo are.

135
00:07:48,171 --> 00:07:49,004
They made the following amount under 
pressure to accept more immigrants as 

136
00:07:59,161 --> 00:08:01,470
workforce shrinks.
But despite what it looks like,

137
00:08:01,471 --> 00:08:02,304
this is not japan's biggest problem.
Japan has seen the last 20 years go by 

138
00:08:06,480 --> 00:08:11,440
with no economic growth.
This is what experts have goals the last

139
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,660
decades and it has a lot to do with 
immigration as well.

140
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:19,260
Create that.
It stopped innovating.

141
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:23,280
We all want to enter in Japan as a 
country of technology and innovation.

142
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,410
The country where companies like 
nintendo,

143
00:08:25,411 --> 00:08:26,430
sony,
toshiba,

144
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:27,293
where they will

145
00:08:28,930 --> 00:08:31,160
on line.

146
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,210
So the reality is these companies are 
really old.

147
00:08:34,270 --> 00:08:36,520
Nintendo was founded in 18,
89,

148
00:08:36,670 --> 00:08:39,160
and so I always said it was created in 
1937.

149
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,163
Actually.
Can anybody name any japanese companies 

150
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:45,030
that were created in the 21st century?
You probably couldn't,

151
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:45,883
but on the other hand,
you could probably name five to 10 

152
00:08:47,401 --> 00:08:49,710
american companies that were formed 
during the same.

153
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
It started at 52 percent of all new 
silicon valley companies between 1995 

154
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:02,723
and 2005.
The entrepreneurial rates among 

155
00:09:05,190 --> 00:09:09,600
immigrant populations is two to three 
times higher than natives,

156
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:12,750
and this is a trend that you find in 
every country.

157
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:14,820
For instance,
one of the founders of google,

158
00:09:14,821 --> 00:09:19,110
sanjay brinn was born in moscow.
The cofounder of whatsapp was born in.

159
00:09:19,111 --> 00:09:24,111
Yeah,
just about silicon valley startups.

160
00:09:26,450 --> 00:09:27,283
Just take a walk around your 
neighborhood and you'll see hundreds of 

161
00:09:29,301 --> 00:09:31,580
chinese doors,
mexican restaurants,

162
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:32,473
and all other kinds of small businesses 
created by immigrants and it does make 

163
00:09:36,381 --> 00:09:39,830
complete sense that immigrants will have
an entrepreneurial spirit.

164
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:40,880
At the end of the day,
though,

165
00:09:40,881 --> 00:09:43,790
you seem leave their home country on 
risk takers.

166
00:09:43,850 --> 00:09:47,030
Not only that,
immigrants bring with them their culture

167
00:09:47,031 --> 00:09:48,890
to a new country,
which helps them.

168
00:09:48,891 --> 00:09:50,190
In thinking outside of the.

169
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:54,340
Let's take a look.

170
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:57,500
There's another example.
Charles feldman was a german immigrants.

171
00:09:57,501 --> 00:10:01,230
Do New York city in the 19th century.
Soon he realized that the work is in the

172
00:10:01,231 --> 00:10:02,064
city,
needed some sort of food that can be 

173
00:10:03,411 --> 00:10:04,244
cooked and sold on the streets,
but that's when he decided to import 

174
00:10:06,831 --> 00:10:10,640
sausages from his home country and 
that's when the hot dog was born.

175
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:15,440
TodaY this meal feeds millions of people
from all around the planets and this.

176
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,483
This is just one example.
There are thousands upon thousands more 

177
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:21,553
in short,
when cultures mixed new ideas and 

178
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,164
methodologies are created.
This is what business people call 

179
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,273
innovation and this.
This is the special sauce that makes 

180
00:10:30,891 --> 00:10:32,300
companies and countries

181
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,040
well,
what's going on in Japan?

182
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,953
I'm surprisingly,
Japan has the lowest entrepreneurial 

183
00:10:40,921 --> 00:10:41,754
rate in the developed world.
Just seven percent oF the population 

184
00:10:44,221 --> 00:10:47,580
decides to start a business by 
comparison and countries like Canada and

185
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:49,770
New Zealand.
That percentage is about 10 percent.

186
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:52,080
The japanese dream isn't to start your 
own business.

187
00:10:52,081 --> 00:10:54,750
It's to get hot by one that already 
exists.

188
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:57,030
You know those big companies that we 
previously mentioned,

189
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:57,893
like sony and sheba,
companies that have the same corporate 

190
00:11:00,211 --> 00:11:01,044
and work structure that they had in the 
19 eighties traditional japanese 

191
00:11:07,731 --> 00:11:08,564
electronic power houses such as sharp 
and sony having kurt huge losses and 

192
00:11:13,431 --> 00:11:16,190
shed thousands of jobs,
well competitors,

193
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:20,420
apple and sAmsung have continued to 
increase their market shares,

194
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,313
lazy like football or what american 
schools soccer like keep up with the 

195
00:11:23,661 --> 00:11:27,500
world cup or the us championships.
Twenty years ago there were at least two

196
00:11:27,501 --> 00:11:31,160
japanese companies sponsoring these 
events in 2016.

197
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:35,930
The european cup had no japanese 
sponsors and no matter where you look,

198
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,793
japanese companies are struggling to 
compete with the european american 

199
00:11:40,670 --> 00:11:42,110
indian,
chinese companies,

200
00:11:42,170 --> 00:11:45,410
and the reason is not a lack of money.
It's a lack of innovation.

201
00:11:45,470 --> 00:11:46,303
And this explains why japan's economy 
has been so frozen over the last few 

202
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:51,343
days.

203
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:56,713
This is having a major impact on the 
millions of Japan citizens in order to 

204
00:11:59,721 --> 00:12:00,554
keep productivity up.
Japanese workers have the longest 

205
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:06,680
working hours and the shortest holidays 
of any developed nation.

206
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:07,633
Meanwhile,
they still have the same salaries that 

207
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:14,001
the pattern.
So that is our opinion here,

208
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:17,310
a visual politic,
and now we would love to know yours.

209
00:12:17,311 --> 00:12:18,144
Do you think Japan should open its doors
to immigrants or do you think other 

210
00:12:20,701 --> 00:12:24,870
countries should follow japan's example 
and close their doors to immigrants?
