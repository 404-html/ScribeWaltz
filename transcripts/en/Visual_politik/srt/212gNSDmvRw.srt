1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,160
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:09,940
Lego is the biggest toy manufacturer on 
the planets,

3
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:12,590
but nonetheless,
they aren't even on the stock markets.

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:13,463
Are there industry bm offs like Hasbro 
and Mattel are listed on the Nasdaq 

5
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:19,090
exchange,
but lego with bigger sales have presence

6
00:00:19,091 --> 00:00:19,924
in most of the world's hands.
One of the most valued brands keeps its 

7
00:00:22,411 --> 00:00:24,070
status as a family business

8
00:00:30,280 --> 00:00:31,113
and as we will see later,
this is one of the secrets to their 

9
00:00:33,711 --> 00:00:35,360
success,
but not only vast,

10
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:36,293
unlike a competitor's legging is the 
best 20 manufacturer when it comes to 

11
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:41,690
surviving crises.
So now you're wondering,

12
00:00:41,691 --> 00:00:42,524
well,
what Christ is exactly am I talking 

13
00:00:43,401 --> 00:00:44,270
about?
Well,

14
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,193
of course that would be the toy crisis.
Do you remember when you were a kid and 

15
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,910
maybe you wrote a list of things of what
you wanted for Christmas,

16
00:00:49,911 --> 00:00:51,830
maybe you send it to Santa Claus or 
someone else,

17
00:00:51,831 --> 00:00:53,210
depending on where you're from.
Well,

18
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,103
what did you ask for for Christmas?
I'm sure many of you wanted things like 

19
00:00:56,841 --> 00:00:59,270
the playmobile pirate ship,
a house for your Barbie doll,

20
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,104
or perhaps those power rangers action 
figures that changed their heads when 

21
00:01:02,661 --> 00:01:05,710
you pressed the button.
But today kids have changed their tastes

22
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:06,553
dramatically.
Most of the things they want for 

23
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:14,314
Christmas these days.
Video Games and I don't think anybody 

24
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:16,924
will be surprised if I say that the 
video game industry is absolutely on 

25
00:01:19,721 --> 00:01:23,200
fire these days.
Titles like call of duty and battlefield

26
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:26,320
have a bigger budget than most Hollywood
productions.

27
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:27,520
However,
the toy industry,

28
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,430
well that's going the other way and this
explains news like this.

29
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:38,170
R US filed for bankruptcy,
but we'll keep stores open.

30
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:38,890
Yes,
Steve,

31
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:42,370
you at the toy industry is set only in 
dire straits.

32
00:01:42,510 --> 00:01:43,343
Let's,
there is an exception to this rule and 

33
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,200
as you might imagine that exception is 
Lego.

34
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,093
Two years ago they beat their own sales 
records and they've been kicking us for 

35
00:01:50,651 --> 00:01:53,140
the whole last decade,
Christmas after Christmas.

36
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,250
The question is how is Lego surviving 
the video game industry?

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:04,600
Is Lego as good as it seems or are we 
maybe missing some details here?

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,493
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

39
00:02:06,281 --> 00:02:08,500
these questions,
but before we do as usual,

40
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,210
that's taken a look back at the history

41
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:16,450
family

42
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:19,510
business that go.
He started out in a very small carpentry

43
00:02:19,511 --> 00:02:22,200
workshop in a village called billings in
the middle of dinner.

44
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,143
Mark,

45
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,900
by that time,
there were already some big 20 companies

46
00:02:27,901 --> 00:02:28,734
like Parker and the creators of 
blockbusters and like monopoly or the 

47
00:02:31,111 --> 00:02:31,944
Ouija board.
During this time Mr Christine's and was 

48
00:02:33,481 --> 00:02:35,790
manufacturing all kinds of wood and 
products.

49
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:36,653
But in 1932 he realized that 
specialization is the key to success 

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,733
with the health of his eight employees.
He started manufacturing toys and only 

51
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,664
toys.
Soon his product stood out for their 

52
00:02:46,051 --> 00:02:47,130
quality.
In fact,

53
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:49,650
we could summarize it cause work 
philosophy with one

54
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,750
quite need.
The

55
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:55,810
best is good enough.
Or Kirk Kristiansen,

56
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:56,943
founder of Lego,
but the turning point for Lego came 

57
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,183
world war team.
One day a British salesman appeared in 

58
00:03:01,751 --> 00:03:02,584
this carpenter's workshop with a game 
changing product and this was of course 

59
00:03:05,441 --> 00:03:06,274
plastic.
This brand new material and our 

60
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:12,510
factories to create things in a cheap,
precise and industrial way time.

61
00:03:14,250 --> 00:03:16,490
The new workshop manager was Mr 
Christine's son,

62
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:18,390
son,
a man named gottfried.

63
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:19,283
He immediately realized the enormous 
potential of this new material and some 

64
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:23,453
years later and Lego licensed and now 
famous block assembly system thus ends 

65
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:27,114
with that.
The most successful toy of all time was 

66
00:03:29,011 --> 00:03:29,844
born.
Yeah,

67
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:34,713
controls that Lego are so intense that 
even the blocks that are sold today in 

68
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:38,434
2017 can be assembled with the ones that
were sold by manufacturers back in 1958 

69
00:03:43,270 --> 00:03:45,190
and the same applies to their corporate 
philosophy.

70
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,560
If there is a characteristic of the 
Christians and the family,

71
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
it's the they when that shooting,

72
00:03:53,950 --> 00:03:56,770
here's an example before they started to
produce thesis in Green,

73
00:03:56,890 --> 00:04:01,450
these fans more than 10 years conducting
studies and discussions of the companies

74
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,284
in the industry had no problem taking 
out loans to buy new factories and come 

75
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:07,900
up with new product lines,
but Lego was one of a kind.

76
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:08,853
They always tried to finance their 
expansion with their own profits and 

77
00:04:11,831 --> 00:04:15,130
this explains why they had slower but 
more solid growth.

78
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:16,023
Despite all of this,
during the 70s and eighties Lego was on 

79
00:04:18,161 --> 00:04:21,670
fire and their product is covered every 
stage of a child's development.

80
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,660
This morning,
a kid as well.

81
00:04:22,661 --> 00:04:25,930
They had deep play blocks with vivid 
colors and bigger blocks.

82
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,000
After that,
between five and 15 years old,

83
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:30,370
you had the classic Lego pieces.
I finally,

84
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:31,204
for the teenagers,
he wanted to improve their engineering 

85
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,390
skills.
There was Lego technic,

86
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,283
and let's be honest here,
has anyone not played with any of those 

87
00:04:37,001 --> 00:04:37,834
products

88
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:40,403
as if this was

89
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:43,010
not enough and they go had its own theme
park,

90
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:43,873
the famous Lego lands,
these weren't another moneymaking 

91
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,740
machine.
Hold on a minute because in the nineties

92
00:04:51,410 --> 00:04:56,410
things they went a little sour graphic 
crisis.

93
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:58,893
The 1960s on known as the baby boom 
couples in Europe and America had lots 

94
00:05:02,591 --> 00:05:03,424
and lots of babies and this meant the 
during the seventies and eighties there 

95
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,710
were enough kids to sustain the 20 
manufacturing industry.

96
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,633
Nonetheless,
the 90s they were a totally different 

97
00:05:10,961 --> 00:05:11,794
animal.
All of a sudden families have less kid 

98
00:05:16,030 --> 00:05:16,863
and as you can imagine,
this was a bad thing for a company like 

99
00:05:18,641 --> 00:05:19,474
Lego.
Every year they sold less than the 

100
00:05:20,891 --> 00:05:24,700
previous one and no matter how many fun 
parks they opened in the United States,

101
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,510
profits kept getting lower and lower.
These were bad times for Lego.

102
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:29,493
I'm a Christian

103
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,353
family,

104
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,033
which makes toy plastic building blocks,
expects to report a loss in 1998 it's 

105
00:05:39,501 --> 00:05:42,560
the first since the 1930s during these 
years,

106
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:45,170
the CEO is the founder's Godson,
Cagelles Christianson.

107
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:49,010
He was 57 years old and he had been 
leading the company for nine years.

108
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:53,180
He saw how day off today his family 
business was getting towards bankruptcy.

109
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,383
In that moment,
he took one of the bravest and wisest 

110
00:05:56,391 --> 00:05:59,990
decisions and can take.
He stepped aside and let someone younger

111
00:05:59,991 --> 00:06:04,991
take charge.
Y'All didn't,

112
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,970
couldn't stop with just 36 when he took 
Lego's wheel.

113
00:06:08,030 --> 00:06:08,863
Not only that,
he was the first CEO that came from 

114
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,950
outside of the Christian Center family.
Nonetheless,

115
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:14,210
this transition,
he was a friend.

116
00:06:14,220 --> 00:06:17,720
Anyone performer in the new CEO worked 
alongside each other for years.

117
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:22,173
Okay,

118
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:25,120
good.
[inaudible] would advise and Jorgen with

119
00:06:25,121 --> 00:06:28,030
the site and this new strategy.
It was based on two pillars.

120
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:30,660
Specialization as marketing.
On the one hand,

121
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,573
they go,
got rid of everything that didn't 

122
00:06:32,311 --> 00:06:35,680
contribute to what they did best.
Manufacturing plastic blocks.

123
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,120
The rest was totally extensible.
They went from 7,000 workers to a little

124
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,540
more than 3000 and Jorgen completely 
restructured the company.

125
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:44,493
Up until then,
the lego video games were created by a 

126
00:06:46,181 --> 00:06:49,990
subsidiary called Lego interactive.
You're getting sold that fat men started

127
00:06:49,991 --> 00:06:54,010
charging royalties to anyone who wanted 
to produce lego inspired video games,

128
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,290
and the same is happening in other areas
of business.

129
00:06:57,760 --> 00:07:02,760
Troubled Lego sells theme park.
The other pillar was marketing.

130
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:06,540
You're going to realize that his plastic
blocks were wonderful,

131
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:08,910
but they didn't really meet customers' 
needs.

132
00:07:08,970 --> 00:07:09,803
Of course,
teachers and experts agreed that Lego 

133
00:07:11,131 --> 00:07:11,964
was a really educational toy.
It all kids to be creative and 

134
00:07:14,581 --> 00:07:15,414
systematic.
Yeah.

135
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:22,360
Even rival companies recognize that Lego
blocks were of a higher quality,

136
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,920
but you guys about the opinion of a 
pedagogue or a rival company,

137
00:07:29,010 --> 00:07:31,170
you see when you have a toy 
manufacturing company,

138
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,033
your consumers of the children,
so maybe you remember how it was when 

139
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:35,544
you were a child.
What did you do when you played with 

140
00:07:36,991 --> 00:07:37,824
toys?

141
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:42,760
Made up stories.
Of course,

142
00:07:42,761 --> 00:07:45,310
when it comes to the Lego blocks making 
stories,

143
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:46,173
it isn't the first step.
First you have to put all the pieces 

144
00:07:48,011 --> 00:07:50,950
together so you can have the helicopter,
you can have with the police,

145
00:07:50,951 --> 00:07:52,720
Scott,
you can have with the police station.

146
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,340
But once you have that,
you just want to play.

147
00:07:54,341 --> 00:07:57,280
You want to make your own movie.
But the hero against the bad guy,

148
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:58,203
all of that good stuff.
This is how lego realized that children 

149
00:08:04,060 --> 00:08:06,760
needed characters,
scenarios and stories.

150
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:09,100
You see the old lego products,
there was something like this.

151
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,870
So yeah,
we're a steam train,

152
00:08:14,871 --> 00:08:16,390
a pirate ship,
a castle,

153
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,800
a city.
Not exactly at the most thrilling things

154
00:08:18,801 --> 00:08:22,280
ever.
But after 2000 lego products went to the

155
00:08:22,281 --> 00:08:22,950
next level

156
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:23,783
lever

157
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,040
see an underwater city about to be 
destroyed by a giant octopus.

158
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:36,310
So now here is the big question.
Do you think is more exciting?

159
00:08:36,311 --> 00:08:39,670
A steam train or a giant optimists?
Well,

160
00:08:39,671 --> 00:08:44,560
with this principal is how a new series 
was born from the Atlantis series to the

161
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:45,394
now legendary bionicle.
All of a sudden lego stopped selling 

162
00:08:47,921 --> 00:08:50,890
plastic building blocks and started 
selling story

163
00:08:55,270 --> 00:08:55,940
stories.

164
00:08:55,940 --> 00:08:56,773
Good enough.
And it's complex enough to inspire toys 

165
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,670
but also even video games and even 
movies.

166
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:05,450
That new product strategy was based on 
three key questions.

167
00:09:05,510 --> 00:09:09,620
What your getting called the three 
moments of truth and a game one.

168
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:12,410
What it's advertised.
Does it make a child say,

169
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,620
I want this too.
Once he opens the box,

170
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:17,490
does it make them go,
I want more of,

171
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:19,903
yes,

172
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:24,910
one month later,
does he come back to the toy,

173
00:09:24,970 --> 00:09:25,803
rebuild it and still play with it or 
does he put it on the shelf and forget 

174
00:09:28,481 --> 00:09:29,590
about it,
but also any of that,

175
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:32,200
if kids like stories,
why don't make toys about their favorite

176
00:09:32,201 --> 00:09:33,034
movies?
This is how lego partnered with Lucas 

177
00:09:34,331 --> 00:09:39,331
films to launch a collection based on 
Star Wars Lego of course the same.

178
00:09:40,821 --> 00:09:43,460
When's the Batman Lord of the rings and 
even Harry Potter?

179
00:09:43,490 --> 00:09:48,110
Virtually there is no movie the kids 
enjoy that has no lego licensed products

180
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:52,100
and you can believe me,
these things are at a blockbuster.

181
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,193
There are hundreds of different makers 
of action figures and dolls whose 

182
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:01,114
corporate logos.
Children are increasingly in different 

183
00:10:03,671 --> 00:10:04,504
to Lego boasts,
an estimated 85% share of the building 

184
00:10:08,951 --> 00:10:10,300
block market.
It's like,

185
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,153
do you remember when I said Lego had 
sold all its subsidiary companies that 

186
00:10:13,841 --> 00:10:15,940
didn't relate to manufacturing of 
plastic pieces?

187
00:10:16,090 --> 00:10:17,110
Well,
that was true,

188
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:20,830
but now they make a fortune with the 
royalties they charge to all of those.

189
00:10:20,831 --> 00:10:24,070
He made video games and movies about 
Lego and believe me,

190
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,880
this has become an absolute money making
machine.

191
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,030
The lego movie premiered last Friday and
made $69 million in its opening weekend,

192
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,870
making it the largest debut of the year 
so

193
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:40,913
far.

194
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,273
This explains why while other toy 
companies are struggling to win the 

195
00:10:47,501 --> 00:10:48,334
battle against video games,
Lego is making record sales in all 

196
00:10:51,311 --> 00:10:53,230
markets,
including the USA.

197
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:57,783
Big Opportunity here is Asia.
This is a brand new untapped market 

198
00:11:02,171 --> 00:11:03,004
ready to be opened.
Companies like mattel or Hasbro are 

199
00:11:05,651 --> 00:11:06,484
already compensating for their losses 
and America and Europe with sales in 

200
00:11:09,071 --> 00:11:09,904
China,

201
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:16,470
like for Lego.
This is a whole new challenge.

202
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,200
This is why they're making changes at 
the company.

203
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:20,333
Again,
we aren't talking about a big challenge 

204
00:11:22,081 --> 00:11:22,914
here in the last 15 years.
Like it was multiplied best sales by 

205
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:30,231
five and they went from having 3000 
workers to more than 19,000 nonetheless,

206
00:11:30,601 --> 00:11:31,434
you know from this video that 
Christine's in his philosophy is not 

207
00:11:33,511 --> 00:11:34,344
about taking many risks,
but in the last two years sales have 

208
00:11:36,781 --> 00:11:37,614
declined to this or this and this.
Now they want to conquer China as they 

209
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:42,210
want to have their accounting books 
healthier than ever.

210
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,073
And this explains policies like this one
lego predict growth in its China 

211
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:54,010
business but sheds 1400 jobs after a 
sales slump.

212
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:57,360
Okay,

213
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,940
so now that you know the story of Lego,
the question really becomes,

214
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:00,774
do you think lego can conquer the 
Chinese markets or do you think they're 

215
00:12:03,271 --> 00:12:05,670
going to lose the battle?
They're against video games?

216
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,593
Well,
please leave your answer in the comment
