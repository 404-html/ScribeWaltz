1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,833
Donald trump's unexpected presidential.
When the rejection of the peace 

2
00:00:03,391 --> 00:00:06,090
agreement between the Colombian 
government and the FARC,

3
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:10,570
the surprise Brexit victory folks 2016 
what was the uh,

4
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:11,513
in which forecasts fails?
And it was precisely then there's an 

5
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:17,910
ever present and very important 
question.

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,080
Rose.
Once again,

7
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:24,180
all surveys useful ver anything and to 
what extent can we trust these surveys?

8
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:34,283
Okay.

9
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:36,680
In a world where information is readily 
available,

10
00:00:36,681 --> 00:00:39,890
everywhere and changes are happening at 
a dizzying pace,

11
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:42,680
pulse have become a political and 
commercial weapon,

12
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:45,270
whether it's to gain votes or to sell 
products.

13
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:47,660
Getting to new voters or customer's 
tastes,

14
00:00:47,661 --> 00:00:50,960
preferences and concerns is usually 
highly recommended.

15
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:52,250
I believe me.
Wow.

16
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:53,210
Check this out.

17
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:58,613
John F.
Kennedy was the first White House 

18
00:00:59,461 --> 00:01:04,230
candidate who used and relied on poles 
to prepare his campaign strategy.

19
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:05,123
Kennedy's team systematically used 
surveys to discovering and analyze 

20
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:09,084
voters opinions and concerns in such a 
way that they'd be able to adapt to the 

21
00:01:12,361 --> 00:01:15,840
future president's political discourse 
do these very issues.

22
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:16,713
Very example,
one of the surveys with which the 

23
00:01:17,821 --> 00:01:18,654
Kennedy team works revealed that only 
30% of families could send their 

24
00:01:22,111 --> 00:01:22,944
children to university.
But that 80% of families still dreamed 

25
00:01:25,981 --> 00:01:28,070
of being able to do that someday.
Sorry,

26
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:30,600
can you guess what Kennedy did off the 
last?

27
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:31,381
Well,
yes.

28
00:01:31,381 --> 00:01:32,214
He insisted in his features a gain in 
the game that education was a priority 

29
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:39,480
for him and that he would improve 
trading opportunities for every family's

30
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:42,090
children while the public,
they responded to this message,

31
00:01:42,091 --> 00:01:42,820
well,

32
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:45,400
if we're going to absorb the new 
technology,

33
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:46,323
we're going to have the have the path 
train people in the world and they're 

34
00:01:48,731 --> 00:01:51,310
going to come out of this state and the 
other 49 states

35
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,010
that was an old,
as you probably know,

36
00:01:53,011 --> 00:01:53,844
John F.
Kennedy was Catholic and this wasn't 

37
00:01:55,231 --> 00:01:57,600
very well received and the Protestant 
regions,

38
00:01:57,601 --> 00:02:00,870
which is why many Protestant voters 
weren't willing to vote for him.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,793
Well,
the Kennedy team decided to use the 

40
00:02:02,761 --> 00:02:03,594
polls to decide which states the 
candidate would visit during the 

41
00:02:06,091 --> 00:02:06,924
presidential campaign.
That way they left out new less than 30 

42
00:02:09,631 --> 00:02:10,464
states,
many of them precisely because of the 

43
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:14,580
voters reluctance to vote for a Catholic
Candida's.

44
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:18,210
Thus the Kennedy campaigns in was able 
to concentrate all of its efforts on the

45
00:02:18,211 --> 00:02:22,260
states where they had a shot.
As you definitely know,

46
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:27,350
Kennedy became president.
As you can see,

47
00:02:31,171 --> 00:02:35,520
polls I powerful weapon for drawing 
political and business strategies.

48
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:36,383
That's why since Kennedy,
the vast majority of politicians have 

49
00:02:39,421 --> 00:02:43,800
had a great fondness for surveys and 
demographic studies because well,

50
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,723
knowledge is power and not only that,
the polls have also acquired another 

51
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:49,134
ability,
the ability to influence the decision 

52
00:02:51,061 --> 00:02:54,900
making process.
That is polls can actually gain votes or

53
00:02:54,901 --> 00:02:59,901
clients by themselves,
whether by useful voting,

54
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,510
compromising,
coattail effect of voting.

55
00:03:03,550 --> 00:03:04,383
It doesn't really matter.
Usually when a survey says that 

56
00:03:06,191 --> 00:03:07,024
something is in high demand,
it's natural demand tends to grow even 

57
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:12,790
though it may never reach the savvis 
levels.

58
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,713
It's exactly due to this effect.
There's Paula stations and many 

59
00:03:15,521 --> 00:03:16,354
companies are so addicted to 
continuously making surveys of all 

60
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:19,900
kinds.
However,

61
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:22,360
surveys on not always conducted as they 
should be,

62
00:03:22,361 --> 00:03:26,080
and that has led to some occasional very
huge mistakes.

63
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:30,780
I've just received a call from Secretary
Clinton.

64
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,880
The big mistakes

65
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:39,093
the years political polls have left 
behind a huge trail of flaws and 

66
00:03:41,711 --> 00:03:46,711
mistakes of truly galactic proportions.
Perhaps one of the best known happens in

67
00:03:46,871 --> 00:03:47,704
1936 you think presidential elections 
were being held in the United States 

68
00:03:51,161 --> 00:03:53,830
that year and the magazine Literary 
Digest,

69
00:03:53,831 --> 00:03:56,650
which was one of the most important in 
the world at the time,

70
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:57,484
carried out a macro survey was one of 
the largest and most expensive surveys 

71
00:04:01,211 --> 00:04:02,044
of all time.
The sample included almost two and a 

72
00:04:04,361 --> 00:04:05,760
half million people.

73
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,823
Cool

74
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:08,173
with Artesia in hand.
The magazine determines that without a 

75
00:04:10,251 --> 00:04:11,540
doubt,
Alfred Landon,

76
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:12,403
the Republican governor of Kansas,
would become the next president of the 

77
00:04:15,351 --> 00:04:17,810
United States.
He would defeat the Democrats,

78
00:04:17,811 --> 00:04:20,840
Franklin Roosevelt,
by more than the 14 points.

79
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,000
This is what the survey stated,
but as you all know the truth,

80
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:29,630
it was quite different.
Roosevelt's utterly destroyed his rival,

81
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:30,464
beating him by more than 24 points,
and of course he became the new tenant 

82
00:04:33,381 --> 00:04:34,214
of the White House.
Since that invokes the Saturdays of the 

83
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,254
magazine,
literary digest are considered absolute 

84
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,404
nonsense.
They're known to be demographic studies 

85
00:04:43,331 --> 00:04:46,360
that are full of errors and plenty of 
bias.

86
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:47,283
The reality is that this magazine 
surveys should have been used as a 

87
00:04:49,961 --> 00:04:50,794
manual on how not to conduct surveys,
but don't think that this was the only 

88
00:04:54,830 --> 00:04:56,320
resoundingly mistake,
not at all.

89
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:58,990
In fact,
history is littered with examples.

90
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,720
The 1948 campaign because it Harry 
Truman,

91
00:05:02,730 --> 00:05:03,563
Franklin Roosevelt success,
they against the Republican New York 

92
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:09,630
State Governor Thomas Dewey,
he'd become tremendously popular for his

93
00:05:09,631 --> 00:05:13,590
prosecution of organized crime,
specifically for his wall with the caper

94
00:05:13,591 --> 00:05:14,424
lucky Luciano.
The fact is that Thomas Dewey was the 

95
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:20,250
big favorite to win the elections.
All the polls presented him as the clear

96
00:05:20,251 --> 00:05:24,030
winner and even some newspapers jumped 
ahead to calling him president dewey.

97
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:24,923
The difference between both candidates 
seemed so great so that one of the 

98
00:05:27,751 --> 00:05:28,584
country's leading a survey experts,
elmo roper said that he wasn't going to 

99
00:05:31,891 --> 00:05:35,130
do any more poles or any surveys or 
anything like that.

100
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:39,120
It just wasn't worth speculating on 
something so incredibly obvious.

101
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:41,550
Dewey,
he would absolutely be the president.

102
00:05:44,730 --> 00:05:45,810
Well,
once again,

103
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:47,100
history is how I dealt rather 
differently.

104
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,580
Dreaming won the election.
By more than 2 million votes.

105
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,473
Have a look at this picture.
It shows the United States President 

106
00:05:53,611 --> 00:05:54,444
Harry Truman with a copy of the first 
edition of the Chicago daily whose 

107
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,320
headline reads dewey defeats Truman.
Yup.

108
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,213
The journalist's thought it was such a 
safe choice that they prepared the news 

109
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:05,563
before the vote had even taken place.
And at this point we'd like you to 

110
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,774
imagine that newspaper editors face,
but just a second because these big 

111
00:06:12,771 --> 00:06:15,650
mistakes,
they don't exclusively come from the u s

112
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,543
for example,
there are the British elections of 1992 

113
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:22,220
all polls showed a clear victory for the
Labour party.

114
00:06:22,250 --> 00:06:26,030
Undoubtedly often 13 years in power.
At the time of the conservatives,

115
00:06:26,031 --> 00:06:28,100
it was coming to an end.
But once again,

116
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,550
the reality was quite different.
And the conservative John Major,

117
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:32,443
he took over 10 Downing Street.
So check out the huge difference here 

118
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,900
between theory and reality.
The fact is that we could spend a lot of

119
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:50,170
time commenting on all the macro 
mistakes that surveys have made.

120
00:06:50,171 --> 00:06:53,050
But let's go back to our initial 
question.

121
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:57,130
Having seen all of this,
can we trust polls?

122
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:05,473
Can we trust polls?
So now we've seen some of the biggest 

123
00:07:10,041 --> 00:07:13,040
mistakes that surveys have made in our 
history.

124
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:16,250
However,
the field has evolved a lot.

125
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:18,500
And the truth is that it's pretty 
efficient.

126
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:23,620
I mean it works.
A study conducted by professors from the

127
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:25,993
University of Southampton and the 
University of Texas analyzed more than 

128
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:28,414
30,000
surveys for 351 general elections in 45 

129
00:07:32,051 --> 00:07:37,051
different countries between 1942 and 
2017 study.

130
00:07:38,261 --> 00:07:41,620
The authors compared what the survey 
said with what actually happens.

131
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:44,110
Well,
based on the results in is a question.

132
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:47,020
Do you know what percentage of the more 
than 30,000

133
00:07:47,021 --> 00:07:50,860
surveys analyzed had a failure higher 
than their margin of error?

134
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,920
20% 30% no,
it was 2% only 2% of all surveys.

135
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,173
And in addition,
the results showed that accuracy has 

136
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:01,320
improved as the years have gone by.

137
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,253
Bye.

138
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,093
But yeah,
I know Donald Trump's victory against 

139
00:08:06,341 --> 00:08:10,090
what the polls prophesized was for many 
irrefutable proof that polls,

140
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,290
hi,
useless.

141
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:12,183
For example,
the Princeton consortium gave Hillary 

142
00:08:13,730 --> 00:08:14,563
Clinton and a 99% chance of winning the 
New York Times where it's a bit more 

143
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,124
cautious setting the probability at 85% 
maybe all of these things explain why 

144
00:08:21,761 --> 00:08:22,594
according to polls,
ironic I know only at 26% of likely us 

145
00:08:26,350 --> 00:08:28,210
voters,
that's one in four trust,

146
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:29,133
most political polls and of course 
taking what happened in the last 

147
00:08:31,871 --> 00:08:35,530
presidential campaign into accounts.
They seem to have good reason to do so.

148
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:36,423
Right,
but hold on a moment because did the 

149
00:08:37,391 --> 00:08:38,224
surveys rarely fail that badly in 2016 
while the answer may differ a bit from 

150
00:08:43,181 --> 00:08:44,460
what we first saw?

151
00:08:47,190 --> 00:08:47,470
Okay.

152
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,310
Yeah,
it is true.

153
00:08:48,311 --> 00:08:50,800
The elections were won by the candidate 
at the polls.

154
00:08:50,801 --> 00:08:53,960
Determined would be the loser and it's 
precisely due to this fact.

155
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:54,803
There's many experts are studying what 
went wrong and many theories have been 

156
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,700
put forward.
For example,

157
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,310
what if trump's voters tend to have to 
answer fewer surveys?

158
00:09:02,311 --> 00:09:04,320
What if the response rate is very low 
ends?

159
00:09:04,321 --> 00:09:06,660
In the end,
those who answer are accounted for.

160
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,140
What if the probability of correlated 
errors wasn't played out well,

161
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:11,580
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

162
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:12,503
ans yes,
some of these matters will pollute the 

163
00:09:14,281 --> 00:09:15,910
results,
but to hold on a second,

164
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:16,793
if we take a look at the results that 
the surveys had estimated that actually 

165
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:25,490
weren't that many mistakes,
you see,

166
00:09:25,650 --> 00:09:26,483
the polls predicted that Hillary would 
win the popular vote by about three 

167
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:29,994
points and in fact,
Hillary won the popular vote by more 

168
00:09:32,161 --> 00:09:33,870
than two points,
but as you will know,

169
00:09:33,871 --> 00:09:34,704
the candidate with the most rights 
doesn't always win elections in the u s 

170
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,380
the one who gets the most state 
delegates does.

171
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:41,243
It was right at this point when 
determining which state each candidate 

172
00:09:43,711 --> 00:09:47,940
would win in the error in forecasting 
the winner was caused anyway.

173
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:49,500
As you can see,
the mistake,

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,433
it wasn't that huge and that's taking 
into account that electoral polls are 

175
00:09:53,251 --> 00:09:55,590
particularly difficult,
perhaps the most difficult,

176
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,300
not only because we need to determine 
the favorite candidates,

177
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,490
but also how many of the people 
interviewed will eventually vote and how

178
00:10:02,491 --> 00:10:06,690
they'll vote on that precise day.
The truth folks is that surveys are very

179
00:10:06,691 --> 00:10:07,524
accurate when it comes to determining 
what the general perception of a 

180
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:10,674
particular issue or subject is and fast 
why they're so important for both 

181
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:17,820
politicians and for companies,
they may include a few mistakes.

182
00:10:17,821 --> 00:10:18,654
In fact,
survey results come with a margin of 

183
00:10:19,951 --> 00:10:21,990
error include included,
but as we've seen,

184
00:10:21,991 --> 00:10:22,824
the evidence tells us that the real 
result in the vast majority of cases is 

185
00:10:25,981 --> 00:10:28,110
usually within that margin of error.

186
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,110
And also that's not,
forget how important trends are.

187
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,753
For example,
it's like a thermometer and ground via 

188
00:10:34,711 --> 00:10:37,380
Madrid,
which says 600 degrees Fahrenheit.

189
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:38,273
It's wrong,
but if you walk by tomorrow and it says 

190
00:10:40,231 --> 00:10:42,990
650 degrees Fahrenheit,
you know one thing,

191
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,160
it's hotter than yesterday,
Pablo Seaman Politiken but now it's your

192
00:10:47,161 --> 00:10:49,230
turn.
Do you trust the polls?

193
