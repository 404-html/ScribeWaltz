1
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:10,470
No way,
it's famous for its extreme climates,

2
00:00:10,471 --> 00:00:11,304
have long sunny summer days and long 
dark winter nights as well as the 

3
00:00:14,341 --> 00:00:19,341
extreme cold,
so famous for their welfare state,

4
00:00:20,251 --> 00:00:22,560
like any other Nordic country,
but perhaps most of all,

5
00:00:22,561 --> 00:00:24,180
they're famous for this smoked salmon

6
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:29,280
and it's not just us that visual 
politic.

7
00:00:29,290 --> 00:00:30,123
You think that it's actually the fishing
industry is one of the most modern and 

8
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:34,810
important in the world.
However,

9
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:35,733
in the last few years,
the most significant element of the 

10
00:00:37,301 --> 00:00:41,650
Norwegian identity has been its 
commitment to the environment,

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:42,543
especially its fight against climate 
change and there is no better place for 

12
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:48,910
us to see this than in their adoption of
the electric car.

13
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:49,773
You see Norway,
it has the most developed market of 

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,874
electric cars in the world in.
You'll find that one of every two cars 

15
00:00:54,731 --> 00:00:57,010
sold is either electric or it's a 
hybrid,

16
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,410
but it's even more to this because by 
20,

17
00:00:59,411 --> 00:01:01,950
25,
which is kind of basically tomorrow,

18
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:06,850
Norway expects to stop selling gas or 
diesel powered cars altogether.

19
00:01:06,851 --> 00:01:09,700
They only want to sell electric and 
hybrid cars.

20
00:01:09,730 --> 00:01:11,740
Now,
this might be pretty hard to imagine,

21
00:01:11,741 --> 00:01:12,190
right?
I mean,

22
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:13,023
it's been a hundred years of combustion 
engines and it all seems as if he's 

23
00:01:16,121 --> 00:01:17,890
about to come to an end.
Middle East,

24
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:18,903
Norway,

25
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:23,150
they're electric car mania.
Well,

26
00:01:23,151 --> 00:01:23,984
it's even reached ships to companies are
currently developing a project called 

27
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,133
Tesla over the seas.
It's goal is to launch the first 

28
00:01:30,271 --> 00:01:33,420
autonomous ship that's powered by 
electric batteries.

29
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,510
The first Yara Berkland,
the formal name of the project.

30
00:01:36,511 --> 00:01:39,510
It's expected to be ready by the end of 
2018,

31
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,340
and this might all,
if you're wondering,

32
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:43,200
well,
what's Norway Secrets?

33
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:46,680
How on earth they made electric cars 
quite so popular?

34
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,980
Is it really all to do about just 
concern for the environment?

35
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:56,060
Yeah,
I mean maybe that is a positive,

36
00:01:56,130 --> 00:01:58,290
but if we're honest,
the majority reason,

37
00:01:58,291 --> 00:02:00,720
well,
it's a little less idealistic.

38
00:02:00,750 --> 00:02:01,583
The key for this electric Colombian,
it's got everything to do with the tax 

39
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,784
incentives that the government has 
granted in order to support the 

40
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:09,310
industry.
So look,

41
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,190
in Norway,
when you choose to buy a vehicle,

42
00:02:11,191 --> 00:02:13,710
you can actually save an enormous amount
in taxes.

43
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:16,170
If you choose to go for an electric 
vehicle,

44
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,400
for instance,
for one,

45
00:02:17,401 --> 00:02:21,780
you don't pay any VAT and in Norway,
and that's 25 percent right off the bat,

46
00:02:21,850 --> 00:02:26,040
you don't have to pay any registration 
fees or any other additional taxes.

47
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,600
All right,
so this all sounds well and good,

48
00:02:27,601 --> 00:02:29,910
but what is the actual results of this 
all financial.

49
00:02:32,420 --> 00:02:34,460
So according to a recent study,
you got this car,

50
00:02:34,461 --> 00:02:38,660
the Tesla model s.
Now if this was a regular gas car,

51
00:02:38,661 --> 00:02:40,640
if you included all the taxes and 
everything else,

52
00:02:40,641 --> 00:02:44,330
this thing in noise going to set you 
back about $140,000,

53
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:47,390
but thanks to the tax relief of the 
Norwegian government,

54
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:52,450
this is actually around $70,000,
which is 50 percent in savings,

55
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,080
which is pretty amazing.

56
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:55,123
Right?

57
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,620
And that's not even mentioning the other
advantages.

58
00:02:58,621 --> 00:03:00,970
I mean these costs,
they don't have to pay for any tolls and

59
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:01,804
they don't have to pay.
Parking meters will say there's another 

60
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:07,470
major advantage because in Norway 
electricity it's mostly hydroelectric,

61
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,030
which means well,
it's both cheap and it's clean.

62
00:03:10,100 --> 00:03:10,933
All right?
So as a result of these policies and 

63
00:03:12,371 --> 00:03:13,204
some of the policies,
the government expects to reduce total 

64
00:03:14,951 --> 00:03:18,250
carbon emissions by 40 percent in the 
next few years.

65
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:19,453
If you consider all of these advantages,
like being able to get a test liver 70 

66
00:03:21,851 --> 00:03:22,684
grands ams,
the fact that it has one of the highest 

67
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:26,470
living standards in the world,
you might be thinking right now,

68
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:29,050
well Norway sounds like a pretty amazing
place,

69
00:03:29,051 --> 00:03:30,760
but taking things back to the 
environment for a minute,

70
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:31,594
the Norwegian constitution,
it even actually protect the 

71
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,190
environment.
Consider Article One hundred and 10.

72
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:37,893
Every person has a right to an 
environment that is conducive to health 

73
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:41,524
and to a natural environment who's 
productivity and diversity are 

74
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,320
maintained.

75
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,153
Natural resources should be managed on 
the basis of comprehensive longterm 

76
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:52,330
considerations whereby this right will 
be safeguarded for future generations as

77
00:03:52,331 --> 00:03:55,780
well.
Article One hundred and 10 B of Norway's

78
00:03:55,781 --> 00:03:56,930
constitution.
Alright,

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,040
so as always in one of these videos,
not everything is sunshine and lollipops

80
00:04:02,081 --> 00:04:02,914
and rainbows.
So noise is this really wealthy country 

81
00:04:05,111 --> 00:04:07,450
and they've got this really big welfare 
state,

82
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,343
but they do have a small issue or 
released a problem that makes green 

83
00:04:11,891 --> 00:04:14,200
beast really angry.
And this issue,

84
00:04:14,201 --> 00:04:17,470
it is about the oil production of 
Norway.

85
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:19,150
But now the question really has to 
become,

86
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:21,700
I mean,
how oil dependent is Norway?

87
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:23,020
Well,
let's have a look at that.

88
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:27,780
Oil addicts,

89
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:33,400
we can take a time machine back to the 
beginning of the 20th century,

90
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:36,460
we would find Norway with a really basic
economy.

91
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:38,320
All they did was fishing,
fishing,

92
00:04:38,330 --> 00:04:39,580
and fishing.
Now,

93
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,414
if we traveled forward in time,
even though things did improve 

94
00:04:42,281 --> 00:04:44,620
significantly,
Norway during the 19 sixties,

95
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,100
no way included in the list of the 
world's wealthiest countries,

96
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,300
not at all.
In fact,

97
00:04:49,301 --> 00:04:52,120
its per capita income was around half of
Switzerland's,

98
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:53,493
1960.
The standard of living in Norway was 

99
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:57,970
about 30 or 40 percent lower than in 
Sweden or Denmark.

100
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,863
Now the standard of living in Norway is 
substantially higher than those who 

101
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:03,400
countries renewal guerard and 
economists,

102
00:05:03,401 --> 00:05:07,480
the Norwegian business school in Oslo.
So now the obvious question becomes,

103
00:05:07,481 --> 00:05:08,261
well,
what happens?

104
00:05:08,261 --> 00:05:09,094
In what way?
How did it become one of the richest 

105
00:05:10,181 --> 00:05:11,014
countries on earth in so little time 
where everything began to change in the 

106
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:16,120
year?
Nineteen 69.

107
00:05:16,121 --> 00:05:20,440
This was the year when the first oil 
reserves were found and the as the ad,

108
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:22,270
well,
it's been a bit of a golden age.

109
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:26,020
The country became one of the world's 
largest oil and natural gas suppliers.

110
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:26,913
As you can imagine,
that this oil revolution means tons of 

111
00:05:29,231 --> 00:05:30,064
money coming in,
money that contributed to building the 

112
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,880
Norway that we know today,

113
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,940
today oil and natural gas are the keys 
of this country's economy.

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,530
In 2016,
for instance,

115
00:05:42,531 --> 00:05:43,364
almost 40 percent of exports and more 
than a fifth of investment had its 

116
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:49,600
origin in the oil and gas sector.
And of course I mean governments.

117
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:54,020
It's getting it's share depending on the
year and the prices of gasoline.

118
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:54,854
All the income that the government 
obtains from this industry route one of 

119
00:05:57,831 --> 00:06:02,600
every 41 of every six euros of the 
government's total tax collection,

120
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:04,490
and I want to give them.
He gets a ton of money.

121
00:06:04,491 --> 00:06:06,560
Well,
that usually means an increase in public

122
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:07,394
spending.
World's most generous welfare state 

123
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:11,780
leaves 20 percent on the Dole.
Yeah,

124
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:14,030
that's absolutely right.
To a certain extent,

125
00:06:14,031 --> 00:06:14,864
we could say the Norwegian model of a 
huge welfare state with public control 

126
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:21,650
of many of the large companies has a lot
to do with oil.

127
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,720
However,
the tumbling all of the pros of this raw

128
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:24,554
material has led the government to take 
an incredibly controversial measure for 

129
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:30,200
the first time in 20 years.
The Norwegian government,

130
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
it's granting new exploration licenses 
in particular tenure instances of oil 

131
00:06:35,271 --> 00:06:38,140
exploration in the Barents Sea,
in the heart of the artist.

132
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:38,993
Exactly

133
00:06:46,830 --> 00:06:47,663
this,
this movement has made Greenpeace and 

134
00:06:49,171 --> 00:06:51,540
other environmental organizations 
really,

135
00:06:51,690 --> 00:06:55,050
really angry great days by the way.
They've taken the government to court,

136
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,870
accusing them of violating the Paris 
agreements and also,

137
00:06:57,950 --> 00:06:58,783
uh,
violating the Norwegian constitution 

138
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:02,130
itself.
As we just told you a moment ago,

139
00:07:02,131 --> 00:07:02,964
the environment,
it's pretty well protected in Norwegian 

140
00:07:04,681 --> 00:07:05,514
law,
but the thing is Norway's green 

141
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:08,540
commitments.
Well,

142
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:13,050
this is set in limitations knowing has 
set out to be a global leader in climate

143
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:13,884
action,
yet continued expansion of oil and gas 

144
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:16,434
production could eclipse the benefits of
Norway's domestic emission reductions 

145
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:20,363
efforts.
Peter Erickson as senior scientists 

146
00:07:21,991 --> 00:07:24,570
within the Stockholm Environment 
Institute and well,

147
00:07:24,571 --> 00:07:27,090
the reality is that the world's largest 
welfare state,

148
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:32,120
it's certainly does not come cheap.
We as a country are petro holics.

149
00:07:32,790 --> 00:07:34,890
We depend so much on the income from the
oil.

150
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,720
Just like alcoholics.
We want to stop,

151
00:07:36,721 --> 00:07:37,554
but we don't know how Thomas Nielsen,
editor of the independent parents 

152
00:07:40,111 --> 00:07:40,840
observer,
but,

153
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,673
but,
but wait for a minute because it is not 

154
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:47,340
like Norway is like some of those other 
countries that also rely on oil.

155
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,174
Absolutely not.
Norway is dependent on oil to a certain 

156
00:07:50,941 --> 00:07:53,370
extent,
but it's not even close to how dependent

157
00:07:53,371 --> 00:07:57,050
Venezuela or Saudi Arabia are honest in 
Norway things.

158
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:00,360
They are totally different now.
Although the government does carry a lot

159
00:08:00,361 --> 00:08:01,194
of economic weight.
Norway has tried to be open to business 

160
00:08:03,571 --> 00:08:04,404
and they have tried to use this oil 
money to fund productive activities and 

161
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:11,970
provide a quality education.
They have also been incredibly committed

162
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,833
to saving

163
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:17,860
fund of funds

164
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:19,520
for

165
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,310
a country that has made so much money 
with the oil industry.

166
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,760
Norway is very different to what we are 
used to the capital city.

167
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:28,700
It's not overtaken by skyscrapers,
massive malls,

168
00:08:28,701 --> 00:08:30,440
extravagant complexes.
Now,

169
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,120
don't get me wrong,
they have spent a lot of money,

170
00:08:32,121 --> 00:08:34,910
but the key to Norway is that they 
haven't wasted it.

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,610
The Norwegian government,
they make this really sensible decision.

172
00:08:37,611 --> 00:08:39,950
They decided to save a lot of their oil 
money.

173
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:40,813
They set up a sovereign wealth funds at 
to invest the money and buy assets all 

174
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:47,540
around the globe,
and this is the biggest sovereign wealth

175
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,330
fund on Earth.
Not even Saudi Arabia,

176
00:08:50,331 --> 00:08:52,820
not even Kuwait,
have saved so much.

177
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:53,713
Now consider this.
Norway sovereign wealth fund hits 

178
00:08:56,311 --> 00:08:58,080
$1,000,000,000,000.
Yeah,

179
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,900
that's absolutely right.
That's a trillion dollars.

180
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:05,790
This is a fortunate of around $190,000 
per Norwegian citizens.

181
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,120
Instead of wasting this money,
they invested it in companies all around

182
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:09,690
the world.

183
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:14,010
This fund is invested money or more than
9,000 companies in 78 countries.

184
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,650
Some of these companies really famous.
Your apple,

185
00:09:16,651 --> 00:09:18,030
Nestle,
Shell alphabet.

186
00:09:18,031 --> 00:09:20,010
That's better known as Google.
Indeed.

187
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,840
We could save that.
The Norwegians,

188
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:22,703
well,
they even own a part of Youtube and you 

189
00:09:24,361 --> 00:09:25,194
know what?
One of their targets is to eventually 

190
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:31,050
replace that oil income with income from
these investments.

191
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:33,300
I mean these are investments,
they produce profit.

192
00:09:33,301 --> 00:09:34,134
It's what they do and these prophets 
have been a return of about five point 

193
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:38,454
seven percent a year,
so if these levels of return will speak 

194
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:41,304
at the same,
Norway would have an average of 

195
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:43,314
$50,000,000,000 in profit,
which is equivalent to about 25 percent 

196
00:09:46,531 --> 00:09:48,810
of their public spending starting to 
sound pretty good.

197
00:09:48,811 --> 00:09:50,100
Right?
And on top of all of that,

198
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:50,934
of course there's the income that the 
government gets from oil and local 

199
00:09:53,041 --> 00:09:53,874
companies,
companies that despite being state 

200
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:57,570
homes,
they do work with market criteria are.

201
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:58,443
So it's still looking pretty rosy.
I mean you might be thinking right now 

202
00:10:00,211 --> 00:10:02,580
that Norway,
what does it have to worry about,

203
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,250
but hold on for just a moment because 
the welfare level,

204
00:10:05,251 --> 00:10:06,084
it does seem to have a solid base,
but the government is absolutely 

205
00:10:08,041 --> 00:10:08,874
determined to achieve economic 
diversification in order to have a more 

206
00:10:12,331 --> 00:10:13,164
competitive economy so that they 
ultimately get rid of their dependency 

207
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:17,243
on oil.

208
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,610
The reforms.

209
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,330
Nineteen,
27.

210
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:30,530
The center left party has been the most 
popular in general elections,

211
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,620
but in Norway,
absolutely majority's.

212
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,810
They're not really common in 2013,
a coalition of center,

213
00:10:35,811 --> 00:10:36,644
right wing parties like the progress bar
see famous for its radical position on 

214
00:10:39,321 --> 00:10:42,170
immigration.
Managed to put Erna Solberg in office.

215
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,033
She is known as the Norwegian version of
Angela Merkel in the recent elections 

216
00:10:46,790 --> 00:10:49,160
that happened on the 11th of September 
2017.

217
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:52,030
This coalition,
when it was reelected and the intensive,

218
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:52,873
this government is to get some distance 
from what has become known as the 

219
00:10:55,881 --> 00:10:57,590
Norwegian model.
The government,

220
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:01,190
they want to improve the competitiveness
of the country by reducing taxes,

221
00:11:01,220 --> 00:11:03,410
especially for companies both public and
private,

222
00:11:03,411 --> 00:11:07,070
but at the same time they also intend to
keep developing the oil industry

223
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,060
anyway anyway,

224
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:17,340
if they are sure about something.
In Norway,

225
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:18,203
it is the innovation and development are
the best ways to obtain high standards 

226
00:11:22,171 --> 00:11:25,830
of living and improve the environment.
So well now it is your turn.

227
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:26,693
Do you think that Norway,
it should be this example of something 

228
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:30,720
to be followed in the management of 
natural resources?

229

241
00:11:57,430 --> 00:11:58,263
It's called biographics.
It is biographies of notable historic 

242
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:04,210
figures as well as present date people.
Let me give you some examples.

243
00:12:04,211 --> 00:12:06,490
We got the queen of England's Vladimir 
Putin,

244
00:12:06,640 --> 00:12:08,460
those just two people on the world,
central square,

245
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:10,510
Elon musk coming up,
Arnold Schwarzenegger,

246
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:12,730
we even the first serial killer,
h,

247
00:12:12,731 --> 00:12:15,370
h h homes,
maybe just hah homes.

248
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,420
We look at all sorts of people longer 
formed about 20 minutes long diving into

249
00:12:19,421 --> 00:12:22,120
the story of their lives in a similar 
style to this.

250
