1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,850
There's the world's getting better or 
worse,

2
00:00:09,851 --> 00:00:13,540
is globalization good or bad is the way 
we relate to each other?

3
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,233
Seem like simple questions,
but they're answers concealed very 

4
00:00:19,241 --> 00:00:21,940
divergent ways by which we understand 
the world.

5
00:00:21,941 --> 00:00:23,770
For those who regularly follow this 
channel,

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:27,040
I'm convinced that you know that we are 
quite optimistic.

7
00:00:27,041 --> 00:00:29,950
Here abouts are planets in general here 
at visual politic.

8
00:00:29,951 --> 00:00:33,190
We are convinced and the analytical data
that seems to corroborate this,

9
00:00:33,191 --> 00:00:36,430
but we live in a world that is improving
and will be better in the future.

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:44,523
However,
that does not mean that that on no 

11
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,730
problems,
I mean obviously there are some of these

12
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,623
are as serious as this.
We are facing the largest humanitarian 

13
00:00:52,991 --> 00:00:56,500
crisis since the creation of the United 
Nations in 1945.

14
00:00:56,530 --> 00:00:57,363
Now more than 20 million people across 
four countries face starvation and 

15
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,540
famine.
Yes,

16
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:02,403
of course,
there are still many problems on this 

17
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:05,433
planet.
Well,

18
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,110
within recent years,
globalization has become,

19
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,003
in most cases,
the culprit of everything and the 

20
00:01:11,321 --> 00:01:13,060
scapegoat for all of our centers.

21
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:18,470
Unemployment's relocation,
poverty,

22
00:01:18,471 --> 00:01:19,670
inequality.
For many people,

23
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:23,150
these are the consequences of a process 
of global integration,

24
00:01:23,210 --> 00:01:25,730
which more and more people think has 
gone too far.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:28,340
The numbers are quite clear.
Every time a survey has done,

26
00:01:28,370 --> 00:01:31,940
most people think that the world is 
getting worse and this is happening in a

27
00:01:31,941 --> 00:01:35,930
way because of globalization.
Do you want an example?

28
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:36,793
Well,
in 2016 study was published in the 

29
00:01:38,421 --> 00:01:41,300
economist that found that less than half
of Americans,

30
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:46,330
Brits and the French leaved that this 
whole process was a good thing and as we

31
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:48,740
have seen here,
a visual politic,

32
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:49,633
all this growing unpopularity of 
globalization has been exploited in 

33
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:56,870
practically every corner of the world by
all kinds of politicians,

34
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:00,213
politicians who oppose immigration.
You opposed free trade and oppose 

35
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:05,320
ultimately well,
everything that's difference.

36
00:02:05,350 --> 00:02:06,730
However,
on this occasion,

37
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:07,623
it is not a matter of political color in
both rightwing parties and left wing 

38
00:02:10,811 --> 00:02:13,330
parties.
We find this type of discourse.

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,193
Perhaps a good example was the elections
in the United States where we saw how 

40
00:02:16,871 --> 00:02:19,840
both Donald Trump and the democratic 
primary candidates,

41
00:02:19,841 --> 00:02:22,450
Bernie Sanders defendants in one way or 
another,

42
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,313
this sort of speech which can be 
summarized in a sentence as 

43
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,930
globalization is destroying our society.

44
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,893
It used to be cars were made in flint 
and you couldn't drink the water in 

45
00:02:37,851 --> 00:02:38,684
Mexico.
Now cars are made in Mexico and you 

46
00:02:43,851 --> 00:02:47,900
can't drink the water in flint

47
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:53,280
since 2001,
we have seen over 50,000

48
00:02:55,270 --> 00:02:59,980
factories in America shut down millions 
of workers,

49
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:00,963
right?
Millions of workers have lost decent 

50
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:05,290
paying jobs,

51
00:03:05,410 --> 00:03:10,410
but then America changed his policy from
promoting development in America and in,

52
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,520
in America to promoting development in 
other nations

53
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:28,120
with political movements that in recent 
years have spread like wildfire.

54
00:03:28,150 --> 00:03:28,983
I arena has emerged a widespread 
perception that says that globalization 

55
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:33,723
is stopping.
So I think the question we have to 

56
00:03:35,801 --> 00:03:36,634
answer here is this,
what is really happening with 

57
00:03:38,921 --> 00:03:41,920
globalization?
Are we facing a paradigm change?

58
00:03:41,950 --> 00:03:42,940
Well,
that's have a look.

59
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:49,000
The break

60
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,443
last seven decades since the Second 
World War and globalization has 

61
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:58,810
accelerated constantly.
And with it the movement of people,

62
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,030
goods and capital all over the world.

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,873
Awesome.

64
00:04:04,340 --> 00:04:05,173
All these years,
many political barriers to trade have 

65
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:07,934
been eliminated for a company to have 
factories or sell products in a country 

66
00:04:11,031 --> 00:04:13,320
produced thousands of kilometers away.
Well,

67
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:16,070
it's become totally normal.
Suddenly wherever you live,

68
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:16,904
eating Sushi,
pizza and Nachos with molly or even 

69
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,730
drinking a heineken has become the most 
normal thing in the wells.

70
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,800
Almost a tradition in itself,
like a I didn't come.

71
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,630
There might be a handicap,

72
00:04:29,870 --> 00:04:31,020
no.

73
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:37,190
Or even those who predicted that 
national borders would become a thing of

74
00:04:37,191 --> 00:04:38,180
the past.
However,

75
00:04:38,181 --> 00:04:42,020
perhaps the culminating moments of all 
this culture because in December of 2001

76
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,140
when China joins the World Trade 
Organization,

77
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,063
that is when China really integrated 
into the world economy and became 

78
00:04:48,770 --> 00:04:50,870
something of a factory to the wells.
However,

79
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:51,763
when the financial crisis,
suddenly things started to change 

80
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:57,583
according to data between 2011 and 2015,
the value of the world's exports 

81
00:05:01,701 --> 00:05:05,060
plummeted by 10 percent.
This is according to the WTO,

82
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:06,830
and it's not only that,
according to Mckinsey,

83
00:05:06,831 --> 00:05:09,320
the annual capital movements,
this is stocks,

84
00:05:09,321 --> 00:05:10,154
bonds,
foreign investments or loans collapsed 

85
00:05:11,451 --> 00:05:12,284
more than 60 percent between 2007 and 
2015 addition the crisis and all those 

86
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:24,720
politicians you consider the trade is a 
zero sum game web.

87
00:05:24,721 --> 00:05:27,250
Some wind and others always lose.
Have results.

88
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:28,343
In recent years in protectionist 
regulations becoming fashionable once 

89
00:05:31,351 --> 00:05:31,810
again.

90
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:36,810
From this day forward,
a new vision will govern our land.

91
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:42,990
From this day forward,
it's going to be only America first.

92
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,270
America first

93
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,260
business

94
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:51,093
leaders are scrambling to adjust to 
world few imagined possible just a year 

95
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:55,503
ago.
The Myth of a borderless world has come 

96
00:05:56,471 --> 00:05:57,304
crashing Pankaj Ghemawat.
According to the global trade alert 

97
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:04,250
panel that monitors how government's 
taken measures that affects trades since

98
00:06:04,251 --> 00:06:06,650
2008,
more than 8,000

99
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,110
protectionist regulations have been put 
into play.

100
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:15,813
Wait just a moment because although it 
does seem true that in recent years 

101
00:06:18,741 --> 00:06:22,670
international traders lost strength,
this is not entirely true,

102
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:28,420
not true for two main reasons.
First,

103
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:31,270
instead of seeing what has happened 
since the crisis,

104
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:33,640
let's take a slightly longer period of 
time.

105
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,560
For example,
since the year 2000.

106
00:06:35,561 --> 00:06:38,530
So if we look at what is happening in 
the 21st century,

107
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,560
it so happens that both trade and 
investments have grown seconds.

108
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:47,500
While you know what,
in 2017,

109
00:06:47,501 --> 00:06:50,140
globalization is returning with 
strength,

110
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,460
right?
In recent years,

111
00:06:51,461 --> 00:06:52,294
there has been a revolution that not 
even Donald Trump or Vladimir Putin has 

112
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,014
been able to put a stop to a revolution 
that will make our world look a whole 

113
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:04,201
lot smaller.
Digital globalization

114
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:12,620
trade has been around for a number of 
years,

115
00:07:12,621 --> 00:07:17,480
but now international data traffic has 
exploded in the United States alone.

116
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:21,590
80 terabytes of data enter and leave the
country every minute.

117
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:25,730
A gigantic number that is eight times 
the content of the library of Congress,

118
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,970
of the United States,
which is one of the largest libraries in

119
00:07:28,971 --> 00:07:32,240
the world,
and all of that's happening every single

120
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,160
minute.
Emails,

121
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:35,570
skype calls,
social networks.

122
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,433
According to Mckinsey,
international data flow is more 

123
00:07:38,301 --> 00:07:41,360
important to the economy than the trade 
of goods.

124
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,090
For example,
facebook has just exceeded the 2 billion

125
00:07:44,091 --> 00:07:46,400
active users,
mark off favorite platform.

126
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:50,000
Youtube breaks its own historical 
records every single year.

127
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:50,893
They may seem too little,
but the truth is that the business they 

128
00:07:53,331 --> 00:07:57,140
generate is absolutely huge.
Take another example.

129
00:07:57,230 --> 00:07:59,540
Anytime to have 10 readers of the 
Financial Times,

130
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,374
one of the most important economic 
newspapers in the world from countries 

131
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:08,560
other than the UK to have Amazon or 
Alibaba,

132
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:19,973
which are full of entrepreneurs from all
backgrounds who are all working to sell 

133
00:08:23,341 --> 00:08:24,840
their products.
In addition today,

134
00:08:24,841 --> 00:08:25,674
we can have designers or by video games,
through online platforms and this 

135
00:08:28,351 --> 00:08:31,680
friends.
It's only just begun according to Oxford

136
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,513
Economics and HSBC.
International Trade in services will 

137
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:37,770
triple in the next 15 years.
Just taking a look at this graphic.

138
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:42,950
Okay.
It's

139
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,330
a pretty interesting result.
Don't you think?

140
00:08:47,490 --> 00:08:49,890
These laminates and my husband,
this is one.

141
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:54,900
That's God.
I see my blood every night

142
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,540
because my brother.

143
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,290
The fact is that if we consider all of 
this,

144
00:09:16,291 --> 00:09:19,890
it turns out that the global connection,
the degree of integration that exists in

145
00:09:19,891 --> 00:09:20,724
the world today is higher than in 2007.
Just before the outbreak of the great 

146
00:09:24,930 --> 00:09:25,763
global crisis,
the truth is that each day that passes 

147
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,210
brings us into a much more connected 
world.

148
00:09:30,270 --> 00:09:31,103
Now,
I'm sorry for those of you don't like 

149
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:33,060
it,
but globalization,

150
00:09:33,061 --> 00:09:34,860
it's not going to go away.
Indeed.

151
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,600
It's only going to grow.
In fact,

152
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,463
we'd now like to pose the question,
is it possible that despite politicians 

153
00:09:40,051 --> 00:09:40,884
like Donald Trump,
we are at the door of a new boost for 

154
00:09:43,051 --> 00:09:48,051
global integration nosotros in a.
It was those

155
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,120
no new sunrise

156
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,113
possible,
that if you asked us how we see the 

157
00:10:10,411 --> 00:10:11,244
future of globalization and free trade,
we would respond negatively as we've 

158
00:10:14,251 --> 00:10:17,220
seen in this video.
This is what most people seem to think.

159
00:10:17,270 --> 00:10:18,390
However,
surprisingly,

160
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,300
governance,
they don't seem to share that

161
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,193
opinion.

162
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:25,880
Latin America,
for example,

163
00:10:25,910 --> 00:10:29,210
the breaking down of terrorists and 
restrictions is again becoming fashion

164
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:30,123
cool.

165
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:32,823
Argentina and Chile side,
the most ambitious free trade agreement 

166
00:10:35,111 --> 00:10:35,944
in 20 years,
wallscape took the lead in the creation 

167
00:10:38,081 --> 00:10:38,914
of the Eurasian Economic Union in 2015,
which aims to improve the economic 

168
00:10:42,701 --> 00:10:43,534
status of the countries that make up 
these so called Russian area of 

169
00:10:46,571 --> 00:10:47,404
influence.

170
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:48,790
No,

171
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:49,670
Russia,
ballerinas,

172
00:10:49,690 --> 00:10:51,490
Armenia,
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan,

173
00:10:51,491 --> 00:10:53,370
not all part of this alliance.
Indeed,

174
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,303
the European Union itself has also 
launched its most ambitious free trade 

175
00:10:57,341 --> 00:10:57,730
program.

176
00:10:57,730 --> 00:10:58,563
Yes.

177
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,870
Given all this antiglobalization talking
might be surprised to hear that.

178
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:04,773
Well,
you shouldn't be because the European 

179
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:06,543
Union has just signed a trade agreement 
with Canada and it's about to do the 

180
00:11:08,561 --> 00:11:09,394
same with Singapore and Vietnam and it's
also made progress in negotiations with 

181
00:11:13,061 --> 00:11:13,894
Microsoft as well as beginning to 
negotiate with Australia and New 

182
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:19,870
Zealand's even China wants to strengthen
its commercial commitments.

183
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:20,763
In fact,
it is demanding that the World Trade 

184
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:24,220
Organization recognize it as a market 
economy.

185
00:11:25,510 --> 00:11:28,240
You see when in 2001 trying to join the 
WTO,

186
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,570
it did so under its economic status,
not market status,

187
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,960
and it was agreed that 15 years later 
this condition would be reviewed.

188
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,340
Yeah.

189
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:40,223
All that time has come.
We're talking about a technicality that 

190
00:11:42,271 --> 00:11:46,560
allows the rest of the WTO countries 
such as the United States or EU members,

191
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:49,620
to impose protectionist measures in 
their relations with

192
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:53,000
no,
for example,

193
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:54,040
anti dumping measures

194
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:57,430
or to restrict imports of cars 
manufacturers in the Asian giants.

195
00:11:57,640 --> 00:11:58,473
China achieves its purpose and is 
recognized as a full market economy and 

196
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,733
that is something that will happen 
eventually we will see how it's 

197
00:12:04,841 --> 00:12:05,674
commercial relations with the rest of 
the world are going to have another 

198
00:12:08,380 --> 00:12:09,280
important step 10

199
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,513
street that people listened to,
a lot of protectionist politicians and 

200
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,200
critics of globalization,
but events.

201
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,180
They're going to take other paths.
In any case,

202
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,043
we think this is a good thing,
thanks to globalization and the 

203
00:12:22,521 --> 00:12:24,650
integration of peoples in the last 25 
years,

204
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:25,513
we have lived through the periods in 
which poverty has been reduced the most 

205
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,620
in the entire of human history.

206
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:36,020
Nor do they view that they the one all 
told me to ask

207
00:13:02,910 --> 00:13:03,743
more than a billion people have escaped.
Extreme needs in the middle class has 

208
00:13:06,031 --> 00:13:06,864
grown as never before.
If the average life expectancy has gone 

209
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:09,534
up,
ends up as even global inequality has 

210
00:13:11,371 --> 00:13:12,960
been reduced.
So anyway,

211
00:13:12,990 --> 00:13:13,823
what we hope is that the next 25 years 
are going to be even better and that we 

212
00:13:16,531 --> 00:13:18,300
recognize that,
that all political,

213
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,960
cultural and social differences,
but we shouldn't see them as a threat.

214
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:23,190
And finally,
we'll end this video,

215
00:13:23,191 --> 00:13:25,950
but asking you what you think of 
increasing globalization,
