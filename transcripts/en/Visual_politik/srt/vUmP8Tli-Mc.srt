1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:10,300
I'm going to ask you a question and 
don't google it.

3
00:00:10,420 --> 00:00:13,390
What's the biggest agricultural power in
Europe?

4
00:00:13,391 --> 00:00:17,860
Who is the biggest food export in the 
entire European Union?

5
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:18,793
How many of you might think Spain,
Italy or even France after all these 

6
00:00:22,271 --> 00:00:23,104
countries have good weather and 
thousands upon thousands of hectares of 

7
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,633
arable land?

8
00:00:32,330 --> 00:00:35,360
None of these countries though comes 
close to the Netherlands,

9
00:00:35,361 --> 00:00:36,194
also known as Holland.
To give you a better idea of the 

10
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:41,990
Netherlands is almost the largest food 
exporter in the world.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:42,853
Second only to the United States,
and this is kind of a surprise because 

12
00:00:45,801 --> 00:00:48,140
we're talking about a country here that 
is so small.

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:51,500
They had to build a dams to reclaim 
lambs from the seed.

14
00:00:51,770 --> 00:00:52,603
In fact,
it's one of the most densely populated 

15
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,004
countries in the world to this.
We need to add the fact that they are 

16
00:00:57,441 --> 00:01:00,290
one of the richest ans most modern 
countries on the planets.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:03,620
The first stock markets was created in 
Amsterdam and man's.

18
00:01:03,621 --> 00:01:06,050
I'm sure all of you know Dutch companies
like Shell,

19
00:01:06,140 --> 00:01:08,150
Philips or the bank.
Ing.

20
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,020
Normally when a country has many 
industrial or service companies,

21
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,690
agriculture is placed on the back 
burner.

22
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,520
So now you might be wondering,
well,

23
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:21,383
why?
Why is the Netherlands such a big food 

24
00:01:23,941 --> 00:01:24,810
producer?
Well,

25
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,790
imagine that we have a piece of land,
for example,

26
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,920
we'll say in Spain that measures one 
hector,

27
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:32,160
if you use it to plant potatoes,
we can earn between 7,000

28
00:01:32,161 --> 00:01:33,690
and 8,000
euros per hector.

29
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:34,593
Imagine instead the amount of money that
we could earn if we use that area to 

30
00:01:37,531 --> 00:01:40,330
build a factory or an office building.
When you do that kind of math,

31
00:01:40,331 --> 00:01:41,164
that quickly becomes clear.
Why countries move away from 

32
00:01:42,781 --> 00:01:43,800
agriculture?
Well,

33
00:01:43,801 --> 00:01:44,634
despite all of this,
Holland is the world leader of potato 

34
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:51,110
exports about France above Spain,
above even the US.

35
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,820
And now I can probably guess what 
something you're thinking agriculture in

36
00:01:58,821 --> 00:02:00,920
Europe,
I mean Brussels has got to be giving out

37
00:02:00,921 --> 00:02:02,330
grants somewhere,
right?

38
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,313
Agriculture is indeed one of the most 
protected sectors with the most aid in 

39
00:02:06,291 --> 00:02:08,330
the entire European Union.
However,

40
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:11,300
the Netherlands isn't the country that 
receives the most money.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:14,210
Of course they receive aid like any 
other member country,

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:17,810
but they don't even get a third of what 
grease gets.

43
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,540
And if we compare it with larger 
countries like France,

44
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:21,403
the difference in aid is huge.
So how is it possible that with so 

45
00:02:25,221 --> 00:02:26,054
nessel lambs and so little help,
Holland has become the garden of the 

46
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:35,021
world?
Well,

47
00:02:35,151 --> 00:02:35,984
as you can imagine,
the answer is simply explained in one 

48
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:40,730
word,
technology.

49
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:41,893
In a farm in the Netherlands,
we can find a tractors that drive 

50
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:44,714
themselves as drones that monitor crops 
and of course resource optimization at 

51
00:02:48,351 --> 00:02:49,700
the highest level.
However,

52
00:02:49,701 --> 00:02:50,534
there's still a question here,
why does hollins have more modern 

53
00:02:53,151 --> 00:02:55,310
agriculture than for example,
Spain?

54
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,440
Also,
what is the Netherlands done that can be

55
00:02:57,441 --> 00:02:58,274
imitators in other countries?
Well today we're going to answer these 

56
00:03:00,761 --> 00:03:02,170
questions,
but before we do,

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,820
let's take a look back at their history

58
00:03:07,590 --> 00:03:08,423
from the field to the university.
In the 1970s Hollands had one of the 

59
00:03:11,401 --> 00:03:13,650
most prosperous economies in all of 
Europe.

60
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:17,760
Companies such as Phillips and Abis were
conquering the international markets.

61
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,270
And all of this was great news for the 
Netherlands.

62
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:23,940
But as we always say on a visual 
politic,

63
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,710
not everything was a field of racist.
Imagine being 20 years old and living in

64
00:03:28,711 --> 00:03:31,740
the Netherlands back then.
Where would you have liked to work in an

65
00:03:31,741 --> 00:03:32,574
international company like Phillips with
high salaries and good conditions on 

66
00:03:36,151 --> 00:03:37,710
your father's farm?
Well,

67
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,600
exactly,
Dutch agriculture.

68
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,583
It was on the verge of disappearing and 
we also have to add something very 

69
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,270
important to this.
As we said before,

70
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:49,110
the Netherlands is very small and 
there's hardly any space for large font.

71
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,251
Now,
for example,

72
00:03:54,251 --> 00:03:55,084
there's plenty of lands in the United 
States and that means that farmers can 

73
00:03:57,851 --> 00:03:59,830
group and creates a large farm.
In fact,

74
00:03:59,831 --> 00:04:02,740
today and lots of American farms 
belonged to large corporations.

75
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:06,550
This means that they can scale 
investments and by for example,

76
00:04:06,551 --> 00:04:09,730
planes to fumigate huge areas of lambs.
However,

77
00:04:09,731 --> 00:04:10,564
in the case of the Netherlands,
farms are small with an average size of 

78
00:04:12,911 --> 00:04:17,230
around seven hacks as making large 
investments really very complicated.

79
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,123
To make matters worse.
By the seventies Dutch salaries were 

80
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:23,230
already much higher than in other 
European countries.

81
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:25,780
In other words,
unlike the farmers in southern Italy,

82
00:04:25,781 --> 00:04:26,614
the Dutch couldn't compete with low 
prices and you might be wondering now 

83
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:31,360
why did they need agricor?

84
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,273
Sure.

85
00:04:35,870 --> 00:04:36,703
After rule in those years there was 
already a certain degree of 

86
00:04:38,871 --> 00:04:41,570
international trade.
Then Netherlands goods imports,

87
00:04:41,571 --> 00:04:44,630
food while they manufacturer televisions
or bad things,

88
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:45,590
rice.
Well,

89
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,453
yeah,
that that is rice and from a purely 

90
00:04:47,901 --> 00:04:48,734
economic point of view,
they could have easily let go of their 

91
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,430
primary sex there.
Well,

92
00:04:52,431 --> 00:04:53,264
the reality is in life,
not everything is just the economy and 

93
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:56,703
it's in hollins forming associations 
have a lot of power more so than in 

94
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,520
pretty much every other country.
For example,

95
00:05:01,521 --> 00:05:02,354
in many other countries they have 
something called the social dialogue 

96
00:05:05,031 --> 00:05:05,864
table,
which is an organization where the 

97
00:05:06,891 --> 00:05:08,660
government,
employers and unions,

98
00:05:08,661 --> 00:05:09,494
meat on the Netherlands.
I have something similar at along with 

99
00:05:11,241 --> 00:05:12,074
employers and unions,
farmers and ranchers associations are 

100
00:05:14,151 --> 00:05:14,984
also welcome and in the 1970s Dutch 
farmers and ranchers weren't willing to 

101
00:05:22,311 --> 00:05:23,144
change jobs.
So consider yourself put in this 

102
00:05:24,801 --> 00:05:26,150
situation,
hollins hat,

103
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:28,910
to maintain its primary sector at all 
costs.

104
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:29,744
But at the same time,
all of the odds were stacked against 

105
00:05:31,851 --> 00:05:32,660
them.
At this point,

106
00:05:32,660 --> 00:05:34,880
I know you must be thinking they did 
grants.

107
00:05:34,881 --> 00:05:35,714
The solution would be to simply give 
subsidies to farmers so they'd stop 

108
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,740
protesting.
Right.

109
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,123
This is been exactly need the first or 
the last time that such policies have 

110
00:05:47,251 --> 00:05:48,750
been applied,
but the Dutch government,

111
00:05:48,751 --> 00:05:49,584
they actually had other plans now that 
they had to maintain their primary 

112
00:05:52,231 --> 00:05:54,840
sector.
They wanted to do it well and since they

113
00:05:54,841 --> 00:05:55,674
couldn't reduce salaries or group farms,
there was only one solution left and 

114
00:05:59,811 --> 00:06:00,644
that was to improve productivity.
That is getting the farmers to produce 

115
00:06:03,590 --> 00:06:05,600
more and better food.
Well,

116
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:06,523
how did they do as well?
That's exactly what we're going to look 

117
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:08,630
into right now.

118
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,033
The University of Bugging Meghan,
you've probably heard this sentiment is 

119
00:06:16,801 --> 00:06:17,634
a thousand times silicon valley wouldn't
be what it is today if it weren't for 

120
00:06:21,391 --> 00:06:24,960
Stanford University.
It's the Maca on research for everything

121
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:28,170
that has to do with electronics and 
telecommunications,

122
00:06:28,290 --> 00:06:29,123
but they don't only do research.
They also train the best computer 

123
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,604
scientists in the world.
And when those computer scientists and 

124
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,303
even the university,
they go directly to big companies like 

125
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:39,030
Google,
apple,

126
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:40,410
and Tesla.
Well,

127
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,273
there's far as agriculture is concerned.
The macro of innovation isn't actually 

128
00:06:43,771 --> 00:06:44,604
in the u s but it's in the Netherlands.
We're talking about the University of 

129
00:06:51,921 --> 00:06:54,470
bargaining and also known as food 
valley.

130
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,900
Many of you might not have heard about 
this university.

131
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:59,040
That's because the only work in the 
world of ag.

132
00:06:59,060 --> 00:06:59,310
Right.

133
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:00,143
Gotcha.

134
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,930
That don't have degrees in law or art 
history.

135
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,220
Volga nivens motto is to improve food 
quality for the entire world.

136
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,113
So you might be wondering right now why 
what's so special about this university 

137
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:13,593
or the first difference is money.
The Netherlands knew that they needed 

138
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:18,790
technology to improve their farming so 
well,

139
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,810
what did they do?
Well,

140
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,673
they showered there.
Scientists with money in just two 

141
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:26,290
decades,
the university's research budget doubled

142
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,153
that.
Hold on just a moment because money is 

143
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:32,510
not the only important thing here.
The truth is the most important thing.

144
00:07:32,511 --> 00:07:35,970
It wasn't how much but where the money 
was coming,

145
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,393
see

146
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:43,740
in many European countries.
And then most of Latin American,

147
00:07:43,741 --> 00:07:47,570
there's a very clear line that separates
public and private universities.

148
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,420
Public universities are funded from the 
state.

149
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:52,940
Of course,
they can have some sort of collaboration

150
00:07:52,941 --> 00:07:53,774
with private companies,
but that's not their main source of 

151
00:07:55,371 --> 00:07:57,620
funding.
Long in Nixon's case is different.

152
00:07:57,740 --> 00:07:59,780
50% of their money comes from the 
government,

153
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,840
25% from the university's own income and
to the last 25% from private companies,

154
00:08:05,390 --> 00:08:06,680
and I can probably guess what you're 
thinking right now.

155
00:08:06,681 --> 00:08:07,514
Private company is funding a university.
Does this mean that the university is 

156
00:08:10,701 --> 00:08:11,720
private now?
Well,

157
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:13,900
no,
but it does bring a great advantage.

158
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:17,720
It allows the university to be connected
with the rest of society.

159
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:22,790
When we went well

160
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,470
preparing this video,
we had a phone call with a farmer called

161
00:08:26,471 --> 00:08:28,870
sees a bravo and Spain more 
specifically,

162
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,883
he's from the Canary Islands and we 
asked you about how agricultural 

163
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:33,670
modernization works.
Now,

164
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,940
you might not know this,
but livestock is actually very important

165
00:08:36,941 --> 00:08:39,070
in the Canary Islands,
especially goats.

166
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,790
They have a specific type of good,
they're called the palm,

167
00:08:41,791 --> 00:08:43,930
the goats,
which is unique from any other breed.

168
00:08:43,931 --> 00:08:44,764
In the world.
There are actually several institutes 

169
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:50,230
and foundations dedicated to studying 
this specific type of goat.

170
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,030
However,
as Caesar explained,

171
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,760
practically none of the studies are 
actually useful to,

172
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:00,551
I mean,
think about it.

173
00:09:00,551 --> 00:09:01,384
If you have a goat farm,
what kind of research do you really 

174
00:09:03,461 --> 00:09:04,690
need?
As a foreigner?

175
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:07,720
You want to know how to produce more and
better milk,

176
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,610
so these on how to better feed the 
animals,

177
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:13,000
dietary supplements or even genetic 
engineering are useful.

178
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,010
Well,
if you go to the ICAA website,

179
00:09:15,011 --> 00:09:15,844
for example,
which is the Canary Institute use of 

180
00:09:17,231 --> 00:09:20,650
Agricultural Research,
you won't find anything like that.

181
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:21,633
There are tons of academic articles that
explain the breed origin of the palm 

182
00:09:24,241 --> 00:09:25,074
egos,
whether it's related to other guys in 

183
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:29,860
Morocco or Tanzania or if they existed 
during the middle ages,

184
00:09:29,890 --> 00:09:32,490
but price kill usage,
that kind of zeroes.

185
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:37,173
Meanwhile,
according to the times higher education 

186
00:09:38,291 --> 00:09:42,760
ranking Vargon Nigga and studies are the
most cited in their fields,

187
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:43,653
but that's not all.
I bet you can't guess what the 

188
00:09:45,221 --> 00:09:48,340
university's official languages,
given that it's in Hollands,

189
00:09:48,341 --> 00:09:50,890
you'd probably be thinking they would be
speaking Dutch,

190
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:51,970
right?
Well,

191
00:09:51,971 --> 00:09:52,840
no,
not at all.

192
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:53,703
We're talking about the capital of 
agricultural research here and because 

193
00:09:57,131 --> 00:09:57,964
of this,
more than 40% of the students and 

194
00:09:59,051 --> 00:10:00,580
research stuff,
a foreign,

195
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:03,940
no matter where you're from,
if you have a talent in agriculture,

196
00:10:04,090 --> 00:10:06,070
you can get to a place at this 
university

197
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:12,960
record numbers of foreign students at 
Dutch universities of technology because

198
00:10:12,961 --> 00:10:13,794
of this international makeup.
The official language of the university 

199
00:10:15,721 --> 00:10:18,360
is English.
That explains why it bargaining and is,

200
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,840
for example,
a pioneer in led lamps for greenhouses,

201
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:22,733
which allows for the creation of 
precisely controlled artificial 

202
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,760
microclimates.
Thanks to this,

203
00:10:26,761 --> 00:10:29,200
the Netherlands is one of the leaders in
tomato grief.

204
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:32,370
Even though in natural conditions,
tomatoes would never grow in such a cold

205
00:10:32,371 --> 00:10:33,204
country and there's more here in a 
country like the u s farmers need about 

206
00:10:36,330 --> 00:10:40,290
126 liters of water to grow one kilogram
of tomatoes.

207
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,720
Well,
thanks to this university's research,

208
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:46,410
now one can produce the same amounts 
with just eight liters of water.

209
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:51,360
This is an incredible amounts of saving 
in both economic and ecological terms.

210
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:54,060
But hold on a minute here because 
research is good,

211
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,930
but it isn't really worth anything if it
stays within the university.

212
00:10:58,050 --> 00:11:00,060
And in that regard,
the Netherlands is again,

213
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:00,894
a great example of how things are being 
done right from the university to the 

214
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:12,130
field.
Let's get back to Spain for a moment.

215
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:12,973
Imagine that we have a tomato garden and
we want to invest in this hydroponic 

216
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:18,270
technology that will allow us to save 
water,

217
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:19,193
the European Union,
or more precisely the common 

218
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:21,443
agricultural policy provides all kinds 
of grants so that farmers can modernize 

219
00:11:25,231 --> 00:11:26,064
their fields.
So we'll go to the agricultural 

220
00:11:27,661 --> 00:11:30,600
extension agency where all of these 
grants and managed,

221
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:31,493
so the farmers getting their money there
and then they will make sure that they 

222
00:11:33,361 --> 00:11:35,910
spend it on improving production 
techniques.

223
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,310
So far so good.

224
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,390
But how to farm know which machines to 
purchase.

225
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:47,300
One would think that the farmer would 
know better than anyone what their lands

226
00:11:47,301 --> 00:11:48,134
would need.
But the truth is that the agricultural 

227
00:11:49,401 --> 00:11:52,370
wells evolves as quickly as Internet 
companies.

228
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:55,990
And if nobody advises the farmer,
they'll have to find the information out

229
00:11:55,991 --> 00:11:57,130
themselves.
Well,

230
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:57,993
that's the situation in which almost 
every Spanish farmer has found 

231
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:01,414
themselves.
There's a huge gap between the 

232
00:12:02,711 --> 00:12:03,544
university and the fields.
The dage case though is entirely 

233
00:12:06,341 --> 00:12:07,960
different.
In the Netherlands,

234
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:11,110
they have these so called agricultural 
council officers.

235
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:14,050
That means that there's someone there 
who will explain to the farmer what type

236
00:12:14,051 --> 00:12:14,884
of machine they need to buy and what 
technologies are best suited for that 

237
00:12:18,371 --> 00:12:19,204
type of crime.
Yeah,

238
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,720
and what's the result of all of this?
Well,

239
00:12:24,721 --> 00:12:28,590
Dutch fields look nothing like those in 
any other country.

240
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:32,070
What most of European countries consume 
tons of antibiotics for their animals.

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,993
The Netherlands farmers are already 
using the most advanced veterinarian 

242
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:39,240
techniques in such a way that they can 
prevent diseases instead of curing them.

243
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,660
The same happens with plants,
pesticides in this country.

244
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:45,150
They notice that if they use drones to 
monitor the crops,

245
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:45,984
they can control each and every one of 
the vegetables and prevent them from 

246
00:12:49,021 --> 00:12:49,854
becoming infected.
And in a country where almost half of 

247
00:12:51,991 --> 00:12:52,824
the crop,
so irrigators and they have managed to 

248
00:12:54,301 --> 00:12:55,134
decrease their water consumption by 
almost 90% further agricultural product 

249
00:12:59,281 --> 00:13:02,690
exports surpassed 92 billion euros last 
year.

250
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,073
Not any of that.
Hololens is also making money by 

251
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:06,563
exporting that technology.
The United Arab Emirates goes Dutch to 

252
00:13:13,191 --> 00:13:14,450
ensure their food security.

253
00:13:18,400 --> 00:13:19,233
So the question now becomes do you think
other countries can import these kinds 

254
00:13:22,091 --> 00:13:24,850
of policies?
How far in the technologies developed in

255
00:13:24,851 --> 00:13:27,280
Hollins go to feed the rest of the 
world?

256
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,710
I'll leave your answer in the comments 
below and before we finish,

257
00:13:29,711 --> 00:13:30,544
I'd like to thank cs a Bravo and Angel

00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,743
will seem to be releasing another video 
explaining the common agricultural 

260
00:13:41,261 --> 00:13:44,110
policy that we mentioned in this video 
in depth.
