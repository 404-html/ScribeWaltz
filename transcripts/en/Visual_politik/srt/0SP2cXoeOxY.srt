1
00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:10,140
Unless you are watching this video from 
Syria,

2
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:14,170
it's fair to say that no matter how bad 
the situation in your country,

3
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,220
Venezuela is doing worse,
as of 2015,

4
00:00:18,280 --> 00:00:19,113
they are experiencing more inflation 
than any other country in the entire 

5
00:00:23,291 --> 00:00:24,550
world.
Furthermore,

6
00:00:24,551 --> 00:00:29,380
their capital Caracas is currently 
ranked as being the world's most violent

7
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:30,214
city,
beating out other famously violent 

8
00:00:31,841 --> 00:00:33,730
cities in both Mexico and it's okay.

9
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:34,583
Columbia,

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,463
something as simple as buying toilet 
paper has also become a practically 

11
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:46,180
impossible in Venezuela and scarcity has
become a norm in supermarkets.

12
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:50,260
Other products such as condoms have to 
be bought and sold on the black market,

13
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:51,183
and all of this is happening in a 
country with the world's largest oil 

14
00:00:54,761 --> 00:00:55,960
reserves.
In fact,

15
00:00:55,961 --> 00:00:59,140
it wasn't so long ago,
the Venezuela was the richest country in

16
00:00:59,141 --> 00:01:01,360
the whole of South America,
but today,

17
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:04,540
over half the population lives in 
poverty.

18
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:07,000
So the big question is how did they ends
up there?

19
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:11,290
How did the government destroy the 
economy in such a short amount of time?

20
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:13,360
Today we're going to tell you that 
story.

21
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:18,250
Well,
the variant revolution,

22
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,830
the first character in our story is Hugo
Chavez.

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:25,860
The father of modern day Venezuela,
or should we say the Bolivarian Republic

24
00:01:26,140 --> 00:01:26,973
of Venezuela.
He became presidents after a landslide 

25
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:33,280
victory in 1999.
His campaign was based on the promise of

26
00:01:33,281 --> 00:01:34,114
equality and poverty reduction,
a policy that he called 21st century 

27
00:01:38,711 --> 00:01:41,290
socialism.
One of his first policies was called the

28
00:01:41,291 --> 00:01:42,124
system for the democratization of jobs.
This was meant to be implemented in the 

29
00:01:45,461 --> 00:01:46,294
PD Vsa,
the stage company that extracts 

30
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:49,654
Venezuela's oil,
and don't forget now that we're talking 

31
00:01:51,701 --> 00:01:55,930
about a country that has a bigger oil 
reserves than Saudi Arabia.

32
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:56,793
Yeah,

33
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,680
vsas payroll has more than doubled to a 
hundred and 15,000

34
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:06,514
employees.
See,

35
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,353
Chavez took office in 1999 and that has 
recent them since 2006 to 34 billion US 

36
00:02:14,141 --> 00:02:14,860
dollars.

37
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,693
This was pretty big news considering the
VSA is the largest company in South 

38
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:20,501
America.
Nevertheless,

39
00:02:20,501 --> 00:02:24,400
Venezuela kept producing the same number
of barrels per year.

40
00:02:24,460 --> 00:02:28,270
This means that the staff increase had 
nothing to do with corporate reasons,

41
00:02:28,271 --> 00:02:30,580
but rather political ones.
In fact,

42
00:02:30,581 --> 00:02:31,414
this job or democratization,
it was a way to employ all of the 

43
00:02:34,451 --> 00:02:37,780
unemployed Venezuelans.
The same thing happens in the government

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,720
during the Chavez administration,
public spending,

45
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,220
this

46
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:45,053
men's,
more government workers and more social 

47
00:02:46,951 --> 00:02:49,170
programs have an ever before.
However,

48
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,033
none of this was a problem.
As long as the oil exports kept paying 

49
00:02:52,831 --> 00:02:54,030
the bills.
In fact,

50
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,630
Chavez cut poverty in half despite being
an oil rich country.

51
00:02:57,631 --> 00:03:00,370
Before Chavez.
Sixty percent of the population lived in

52
00:03:00,371 --> 00:03:02,530
poverty.
Ten years after Chavez,

53
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:03,423
only 30 percent did display ship as his 
rhetoric that capitalist countries were 

54
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:10,990
trying to destroy the revolution,
no one would reject Venezuela's oil.

55
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:14,380
Even Nicolas Sarcozi,
Francis Conservative presidents over the

56
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,550
volume was complimenting Venezuela's

57
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:23,630
level.
It's with their strong turnout.

58
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,400
The shows,
once again,

59
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:30,580
the vitality of democracy in Venezuela.
So all of these policies we must add the

60
00:03:30,801 --> 00:03:35,801
famous know I've got this literally 
means expropriate.

61
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:41,570
This expropriation being the taking away
of private property from its owner.

62
00:03:41,630 --> 00:03:45,710
Chavez was no fan of private businesses 
and it was not uncommon for him to visit

63
00:03:45,711 --> 00:03:50,000
a city and go around declaring that 
various businesses being nationalized.

64
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,040
This would include all sorts of 
businesses,

65
00:03:52,041 --> 00:03:52,874
including things like small shops.
All of this ended up with Venezuela 

66
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:57,074
having an economy if it was fully 
dependent on its oil buying 2012 brands 

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:04,850
barrels when 95 percent of Venezuela's 
exports.

68
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:09,080
We should also note here that PD and 
higher costs than any other oil company,

69
00:04:09,081 --> 00:04:11,750
and this was largely because of the 
staff increases.

70
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,613
Nonetheless,
as long as the oil price remains high 

71
00:04:14,151 --> 00:04:14,984
enough to cover the production costs,
it's Venezuela kept making oil and 

72
00:04:17,650 --> 00:04:19,040
everyone was happy.
Well,

73
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:22,670
just hold on a minute because this is 
where things turn sour.

74
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:27,730
In 2014 oil prices fell in Venezuela was
the first country to feel the effects of

75
00:04:27,891 --> 00:04:28,724
this.
For their profit per barrel shrank and 

76
00:04:30,291 --> 00:04:32,300
more and more every single day.

77
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,290
The

78
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:39,840
last now by that time the oil crisis 
started.

79
00:04:39,841 --> 00:04:40,674
Hugo Chavez had already passed away and 
his successor was a guy named Nicolas 

80
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,120
Maduro.
I always look at me funny.

81
00:04:51,890 --> 00:04:56,890
Then flew over my head and I could feel 
the spirit of Chavez in the field.

82
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:00,180
No,
this is not a joke,

83
00:05:00,181 --> 00:05:01,014
nor is it a quote taken out of context.
Maduro found himself the head of the 

84
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,240
country that wasn't making enough money 
from.

85
00:05:06,241 --> 00:05:09,870
It's only export and Maduro had wages to
pay.

86
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:10,823
Then on top of all this,
we have the famous now because of all 

87
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:15,144
that expropriating that was going on,
we've been left with a Venezuela that 

88
00:05:17,761 --> 00:05:22,050
has no private companies,
so even if he decided to raise taxes,

89
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:22,913
there's no one left the pavement,
and this is when Missouri made the most 

90
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:29,400
irresponsible decision that any 
political leader can make.

91
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,030
He decided to print money having 
devalued the Venezuelan currency,

92
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:37,740
the believer inflation skyrocketed.
Here's an example of how bad this was.

93
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:41,910
Imagine you're sitting in a bar and 
crackers in July of 2016,

94
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:44,330
met emily called steel around 50 bullet 
boss.

95
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,490
Then you go back to the same bar in 
Caracas in September,

96
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:51,150
and that same beer would cost you $100 
boulevards.

97
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:55,980
This has been happening in Venezuela 
consistently for the last three years.

98
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:02,453
This had the effect of destroying all of
the poverty reduction measures that 

99
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:06,660
Chavez had implemented.
Oh,

100
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,520
and believe me,
it gets worse from here.

101
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:11,010
Just when things were looking really 
terrible,

102
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:15,630
but decided to demonstrate just how much
worse they can get.

103
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:17,853
Youtube to finish with the price 
increases will be the creation of the 

104
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:24,710
maximum sales brides.
Neil Matsumoto.

105
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,723
According to Missouri,
the hyperinflation was caused by those 

106
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:31,830
evil capitalists.
He wanted to destroy Venezuela.

107
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,770
So the logical solution of course was 
the fight them.

108
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:35,813
So you're probably wondering right now 
what exactly the outcome of all of this 

109
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:39,691
is.
Well,

110
00:06:39,691 --> 00:06:40,524
this time,
let's imagine that you own butcher shop 

111
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:46,840
in the beautiful city of Maricado.
You believe meat from a Colombian farmer

112
00:06:46,841 --> 00:06:49,180
and you pay with US dollars.
For example,

113
00:06:49,181 --> 00:06:50,014
let's say the pounds of beef costs you 
$10 for Venezuelan central bank has an 

114
00:06:53,711 --> 00:06:57,580
official exchange rate of 10 boulevard 
store one US dollar,

115
00:06:57,610 --> 00:06:58,443
but no one's going to sell you dollars 
at that price because the market price 

116
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:01,924
is way higher.
This means that if he wants to buy beef 

117
00:07:04,151 --> 00:07:04,984
from your Colombian producer,
you're going to have to pay the price 

118
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:11,260
set by the market.
This is the equivalent of 10,000

119
00:07:11,261 --> 00:07:12,420
Bolivares per 10,

120
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,833
right?

121
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,383
It's fine,
but then you go back to your shop and 

122
00:07:19,231 --> 00:07:21,960
you want to sell this pounds of beef 
that you bought,

123
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:22,943
but then he find out that the government
has set a maximum sale price of a 

124
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,803
thousand boulevards,
which is 10 times less than what you 

125
00:07:28,171 --> 00:07:30,150
paid,
so now you've got two options.

126
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:35,210
You can close up your shop or to sell 
your meat on the black market.

127
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:38,280
Now some of you might be wondering,
why do they have to buy foreign name?

128
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,220
Why can't they just buy meat that was 
made inside Venezuela?

129
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,770
The answer is that whatever product you 
buy it,

130
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:44,604
it's going to require something that is 
made outside of the country that you 

131
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:49,320
bought the product in.
For example,

132
00:07:49,321 --> 00:07:50,154
if you want to grow weeds,
you're going to need a tractor which is 

133
00:07:51,871 --> 00:07:52,704
manufactured somewhere else and you 
might find that even the seeds or the 

134
00:07:54,601 --> 00:07:58,560
fertilizer also need in a different 
country one way or another.

135
00:07:58,561 --> 00:07:59,394
There is no country on earth that is 
capable of producing all that they 

136
00:08:01,951 --> 00:08:04,470
consume,
not even the United States.

137
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,393
Oh,
and don't forget now that Venezuela 

138
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:09,450
based their entire economy on the export
of oil,

139
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,870
and so dave still,
that's not going so well.

140
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:13,823
Venezuelan oil has become so expensive 
that they'd rather buy it from external 

141
00:08:17,431 --> 00:08:19,610
sources than even use their own

142
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:25,510
be.
The BSA has lounge,

143
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:30,511
one of it's largest oil tenders ever 
seeking to buy some 8 million barrels of

144
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:35,320
us or Nigerian light crude for delivery 
from April through June.

145
00:08:35,530 --> 00:08:36,363
As I mentioned previously,
Venezuelan oil is really expensive to 

146
00:08:38,711 --> 00:08:39,544
produce and it turns out that they've 
just rolled the blind from other 

147
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,810
countries that use their own oil.
Meanwhile,

148
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:44,673
shops cannot import goods.
This is leading to a scarcity of toilet 

149
00:08:47,141 --> 00:08:47,974
paper and there's even lead to
