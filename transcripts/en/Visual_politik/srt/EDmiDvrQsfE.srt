1
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:08,353
I've got a question for you.
What would happen if Ronald Reagan came 

2
00:00:10,521 --> 00:00:13,790
back to life and met Donald Trump in the
oval office?

3
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:14,653
Do you think they'd become friends?
Do you think that shake hands and find 

4
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:20,180
common grounds with similar values and 
political beliefs?

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,073
Of course,
both are considered diehard 

6
00:00:22,221 --> 00:00:23,054
conservatives both aren't considered a 
boogie man for liberals and both had a 

7
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:29,420
career in show business,
but in fact,

8
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:30,313
this is where the similarities.
Ronald Reagan's job as president was to 

9
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:43,140
find the worst recession since the great
depression and to do so.

10
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,490
He promised the Reagan Revolution,
the so called revolution,

11
00:00:47,491 --> 00:00:51,570
focusing on reducing government spending
taxes as well as regulation

12
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:55,810
government,
not government.

13
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:58,273
President Reagan likes the free markets 
and believe that capitalism would solve 

14
00:01:01,581 --> 00:01:02,414
the nation's problems.
They also like to portray himself as a 

15
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:06,890
humble paternal figure.
In other words,

16
00:01:06,891 --> 00:01:10,670
he prided himself on being a man of high
moral values

17
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:14,190
would be unmistakable.
Open this gate,

18
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,860
trump however,
is a totally different animal.

19
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:20,980
He shows off his fortune,
his former model trophy wife,

20
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:24,350
and he is so obviously the opposite of a
paternal figure.

21
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:35,853
He's more like that weird uncle living 
like a bachelor regardless of his age 

22
00:01:38,381 --> 00:01:39,214
and guessing,
embarrassingly drunk during family 

23
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:41,440
reunions.

24
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:44,250
Wow.

25
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,550
On the policy side,
trump is seldom friendly toward the free

26
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:52,200
market and smaller government.
He loves debt.

27
00:01:52,250 --> 00:01:55,640
The idea of trade wars and his 
protectionist policy have taken care of.

28
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:59,850
America seems to be at odds with the 
gips tendency to be in favor,

29
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:04,930
at least in theory of the free market.
As you can probably see,

30
00:02:09,441 --> 00:02:13,550
there is a clash that runs deep in the 
soul of the Republican Party,

31
00:02:13,670 --> 00:02:16,850
or at least this is how it looks from an
outside perspective.

32
00:02:16,910 --> 00:02:18,050
On the one hand,
there's this,

33
00:02:18,051 --> 00:02:19,880
the good old party,
but loves America.

34
00:02:19,881 --> 00:02:23,060
Small government,
low taxes and conservative values,

35
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,320
and then there is this other Republican 
party that loves trophy wives,

36
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:32,350
big beautiful walls and terrorists and 
who's winning?

37
00:02:35,890 --> 00:02:37,600
Well,
you guessed it.

38
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:41,003
There was a wave of Republicans leaving 
Congress among all of these differences 

39
00:02:44,261 --> 00:02:45,094
in values and policy.
The new cycle has been completely taken 

40
00:02:47,681 --> 00:02:52,180
over by a new wave of Republicans and 
she was the most important of them all.

41
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,370
Well,
I would actually be pulled up Ryan,

42
00:02:54,550 --> 00:02:57,160
the speaker of the House and the 
Republicans,

43
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:57,994
golden boy for years for Ron,
the champion of fiscal rectitude and 

44
00:03:01,121 --> 00:03:01,954
smaller government,
and now he's announced that he's not 

45
00:03:06,501 --> 00:03:09,140
going to run for reelection,
and as you can imagine,

46
00:03:09,141 --> 00:03:11,720
he's not the only one.
Many republicans might be living,

47
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:15,440
but there are always new elections and 
therefore new candidates,

48
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:18,290
but also ones with questionable 
characters.

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:19,243
Take for example,
the Alabama special elections held back 

50
00:03:21,411 --> 00:03:23,330
in December of 2017,

51
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,513
back candidate Roy Moore was buried 
under tons of allegations of sexual 

52
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:33,241
abuse of minors.
For these scandals,

53
00:03:35,501 --> 00:03:39,130
Republicans lost the seat in Alabama for
the first time in decades,

54
00:03:39,250 --> 00:03:40,083
but the biggest surprise is that a 
republican president supported and 

55
00:03:43,001 --> 00:03:43,834
alleged sexual predator.
Could you imagine something like this 

56
00:03:46,181 --> 00:03:50,650
just five years ago as you could expect,
this Alabama scandal appeared on all the

57
00:03:50,651 --> 00:03:52,870
national newspapers and hit the White 
House,

58
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:00,210
and now you might wonder,
well,

59
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:04,020
what did Donald trump do to solve this 
pr crisis?

60
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,240
Well,
they did absolutely nothing.

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,163
Nothing at all.
And this is one of the reasons why so 

62
00:04:09,331 --> 00:04:12,570
many Republican candidates are doing so 
badly in the polls,

63
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:13,463
even in traditionally red states.
But what does this mean for the White 

64
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,190
House?
Well,

65
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:20,430
for those who don't keep up with 
American politics so much this year,

66
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:24,620
the country had legislative elections,
these other so called midterms.

67
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:33,150
This is when members of Congress and 
many senators and relax it in America,

68
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,030
the president,
and that is the executive power is voted

69
00:04:36,031 --> 00:04:39,840
in during one election,
in the legislative power during another.

70
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:41,160
This is why,
for example,

71
00:04:41,161 --> 00:04:45,240
despite Obama being Democrats,
the majority of the legislative chambers

72
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:46,103
were Republican,
and if the Republicans lose too many 

73
00:04:47,641 --> 00:04:48,474
seats during the 2018 midterms,
trump is going to be in dire straits 

74
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:55,860
anytime he wants to pass a bill.
That the real question now is,

75
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:56,783
how did the Republican Party gassier can
a political party change their ideology 

76
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:02,490
this quickly?
Well,

77
00:05:02,491 --> 00:05:03,930
today we're going to answer these 
questions,

78
00:05:03,931 --> 00:05:07,110
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the history.

79
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,653
Reagan revolution.
Ronald Reagan started out as a 

80
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:18,920
registered Democrats and a new deal 
support,

81
00:05:18,921 --> 00:05:19,754
but he left the party in 1962 crossing 
over to the gop stating that he didn't 

82
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,610
leave the Democratic Party,
but it was the party that left him.

83
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:30,580
Nevertheless,
things in the gop were not ideal either.

84
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:31,563
According to Reagan,
Republicans had bought into most of the 

85
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:38,611
values of the Democratic Party and 
despite the passionate rhetoric,

86
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:42,023
than once some truth to that.
Have you ever heard of cultural 

87
00:05:44,340 --> 00:05:45,173
hegemony?
This is a concept Marxist philosophers 

88
00:05:47,101 --> 00:05:48,810
like to use a lot.
According to them,

89
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:52,200
the ruling class needs to create a 
consensus,

90
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:56,610
a set of moral values that are shared by
the majority of the political players,

91
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,700
including the opposition party.

92
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,223
Back then idea is like the welfare state
and the need for more governmental 

93
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:09,200
control of the economy that came the new
mainstream,

94
00:06:09,290 --> 00:06:10,123
even the republican side,
to accept those principles if they 

95
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:12,464
wanted to be considered a serious power.
This explains why both Nixon and 

96
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:20,480
Eisenhower did very little when it comes
to economics and you guys did.

97
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:22,970
Reagan was not a big fan of this.

98
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,033
No nation in history has ever survived a
tax burden that reached a third of its 

99
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,173
national income today.
Thirty seven cents out of every dollar 

100
00:06:31,091 --> 00:06:33,310
earned in this country is the tax 
collectors share.

101
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,863
Here comes the interesting pos.
Cultural hegemony is something that 

102
00:06:37,901 --> 00:06:41,410
changes over time.
How well when those values are no longer

103
00:06:41,411 --> 00:06:45,670
solving people's problems.
This is what happens in the 19 seventies

104
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,533
with the energy crisis.
America was really not in a good place 

105
00:06:49,691 --> 00:06:52,990
back then and this was the window of 
opportunity that Ronald Reagan needed to

106
00:06:52,991 --> 00:06:53,824
reinvents the Republican Party and 
create the ideological platform we used 

107
00:06:57,431 --> 00:06:59,560
to know as conservatism.
In other words,

108
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,453
he took something old and made it shiny 
again by more or less creating a brands 

109
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:04,960
new ideology.

110
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,600
The question is,
well,

111
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:11,583
how do you do that?
How can you create a brand new ideology 

112
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:16,780
that makes sense and lets you win 
elections?

113
00:07:16,810 --> 00:07:17,643
Well,
let me introduce you to the theory of 

114
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,250
the empty signifier.
Basically,

115
00:07:21,251 --> 00:07:22,084
Ronald Reagan went to all the political 
groups that fell outside of the 

116
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:28,080
political mainstream at the time he 
spoke to the evangelical conservative.

117
00:07:28,081 --> 00:07:28,914
So one,
you spoke to the military industrial 

118
00:07:30,251 --> 00:07:31,084
complex guys for another,
and finally he spoke to everybody who 

119
00:07:33,671 --> 00:07:34,504
was tired of paying so many taxes.
Then he merged all of these groups into 

120
00:07:38,831 --> 00:07:42,370
one common cause,
liberty and freedom.

121
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,353
This is what we call an empty signifier.
It's a concept so vague that everybody 

122
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:51,760
can project onto the vagueness,
the meaning that they're looking for.

123
00:07:51,790 --> 00:07:52,623
For a fiscal conservative,
freedom means being free from paying so 

124
00:07:55,091 --> 00:07:55,924
many taxes for a whole kitchen.
Conservative freedom means fighting or 

125
00:07:58,851 --> 00:08:00,250
authoritarian rulers.

126
00:08:00,540 --> 00:08:01,373
In this present crisis,
government is not the solution to our 

127
00:08:05,191 --> 00:08:08,310
problem.
Government is the problem,

128
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:09,263
but think about it.
How is it possible to have people so 

129
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:13,800
different from one another on the same 
platform?

130
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:14,693
It's a big time contradictions.
I have someone who wants small 

131
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:19,770
government and someone else who wants to
increase military spending.

132
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,790
Right?
Well,

133
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,590
if you want to create a political 
identity,

134
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:25,470
you need an antagonist.
And Ronald Reagan,

135
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:29,010
he couldn't have had it easier.
Open this gate,

136
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:36,980
Mr Gorbachev,
tear down this.

137
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:42,290
Whoa.
Yup,

138
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:42,380
Yup.

139
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,213
He picked the evil communists.
This is why during the 1980 [inaudible] 

140
00:08:45,811 --> 00:08:48,560
there were so many movies where the 
communists were the bad guys.

141
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,360
Yeah,
you have talked to us like Red Dawn,

142
00:08:50,361 --> 00:08:51,680
rocky four,
and of course,

143
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:53,510
top gun.
All of these movies,

144
00:08:53,511 --> 00:08:57,150
along with Reagan's speeches,
helps create a brand new cultural,

145
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:57,993
hegemonic,
even democratic presidents like crimson 

146
00:09:00,450 --> 00:09:02,820
to promise tax cuts in order to win an 
election.

147
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:03,930
Yes,

148
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,570
but as you know,
the Soviet Union fell in the nineties.

149
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,270
So what happens when you lose your 
antagonist?

150
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,433
Well,
you simply find another one like 

151
00:09:15,821 --> 00:09:20,620
President Reagan did two decades before 
President Bush operated from a Christian

152
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:23,440
worldview that distinguishes between 
good and evil.

153
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:24,363
After the tragedy of September,
the 11th presidents Bush announced that 

154
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:32,290
the battle ahead would be a monumental 
struggle of good versus evil.

155
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,193
The good will prevail,
and that's how these so called evil 

156
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:37,870
became America's new enemy.

157
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:41,410
We will rally the world to this caused 
by our efforts,

158
00:09:42,250 --> 00:09:45,250
by our courage.
We will not tire,

159
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:49,060
we will not falter,
and we will not fail,

160
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:50,930
of course.

161
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:53,810
So I'm not saying that terrorists are 
communists and all evil or that they are

162
00:09:53,811 --> 00:09:56,300
just some sort of fabricated monster.
Of course not,

163
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,660
but they can be utilized to create a 
political platform.

164
00:09:59,990 --> 00:10:02,150
Every important politician,
they've done it.

165
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,920
Roosevelt did it,
Reagan did it,

166
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:04,803
Bush did it.
But what happens when you run out of 

167
00:10:06,591 --> 00:10:08,930
enemies?
What happens when the Soviet Union is no

168
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,850
more?
Or when bin Laden is debt?

169
00:10:11,060 --> 00:10:13,640
Well,
this is the time for,

170
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,433
oh,

171
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:24,230
but trump revolution after the 2008 
financial crisis,

172
00:10:24,231 --> 00:10:25,064
the economic mainstream,
the cultural hegemony was once again a 

173
00:10:28,010 --> 00:10:28,843
challenge resulting in people not 
trusting the economic mainstream 

174
00:10:31,761 --> 00:10:32,550
anymore.

175
00:10:32,550 --> 00:10:33,383
The word didn't spread through 
mainstream media and immediately the 

176
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:36,324
question arose whether or not the lack 
of coverage was because it wasn't 

177
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:42,450
newsworthy or because some of the people
being protested against have the control

178
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:46,620
over the various mainstream media 
outlets on September 30th.

179
00:10:47,010 --> 00:10:48,520
We took a trip into the city to see what

180
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,393
it wasn't being talked about.
When people lose faith in something 

181
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,183
that's usually leaves a void that needs 
to be filled by a new kind of discourse 

182
00:10:56,570 --> 00:10:57,403
and here sweeps in Canada.
Did Donald J dot trump with his 

183
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:04,370
inflammatory speeches during campaign 
rallies all his personal scandals and is

184
00:11:04,371 --> 00:11:08,000
scorching and polarizing public 
statements once again,

185
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:13,040
a new presidential candidate managed to 
align himself with an astounding variety

186
00:11:13,041 --> 00:11:17,390
of political and religious groups that 
felt misrepresented by the mainstream.

187
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,713
In fact,
80 percent of evangelical Christians 

188
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:26,073
voted for trump much more than any other
religious Greek evangelical Christian 

189
00:11:29,891 --> 00:11:32,530
values are about family and moral 
integrity.

190
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,423
So why is a guy like trump with all his 
divorces and sexual scandals not 

191
00:11:36,851 --> 00:11:38,830
perceived as immoral by them?
Well,

192
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:39,664
even in the light of the recent media 
storm surrounding the alleged cash 

193
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:43,720
payment,
do you silence Pornstar?

194
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,554
Stormy Daniels?
Seventy eight percent of evangelical 

195
00:11:47,321 --> 00:11:48,154
voters still support trump as army 
evangelical leaders went as far as 

196
00:11:52,061 --> 00:11:55,870
publicly stating they have given the 
president's what they called a Mulligan.

197
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,510
A do over.
I bought a gun,

198
00:11:57,520 --> 00:12:00,560
is a golf metaphor,
which is strangely appropriate.

199
00:12:00,561 --> 00:12:03,190
It's considering trumps passion for that
sport.

200
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:07,753
Yes,
evangelical conservatives gave him a 

201
00:12:09,081 --> 00:12:11,090
Mulligan.
They let them have a do over.

202
00:12:11,330 --> 00:12:12,163
They said,
we will start fresh with you and give 

203
00:12:13,431 --> 00:12:15,690
you a second chance.
Tony Perkins,

204
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:16,850
speaking at CNN,

205
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:19,020
so how is this possible?
Well,

206
00:12:19,021 --> 00:12:21,840
as you might've guessed,
the antagonists come into play,

207
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:25,980
so who or what is trump's political 
enemy?

208
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:29,220
The first group that immediately comes 
to mind is the mainstream media,

209
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:32,850
or as the American president calls them 
the fake news media.

210
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,713
The second enemy is the so called swamp.
A term that refers to the not so clean 

211
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:40,470
and not so transparent political scene 
in Washington.

212
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:43,740
The third have many more enemies is you 
guessed it,

213
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,693
immigrants,
so trump can always play the me or the 

214
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:49,320
others card and it seems to work for 
him.

215
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:55,350
So what do all these talking points have
in common?

216
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:56,213
Well,
that's the outright has been using them 

217
00:12:57,690 --> 00:12:58,523
for years.
Trump managed to appeal to evangelicals 

218
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:01,764
and members of the foreign rights that 
for a long time it felt misinterpreted 

219
00:13:04,381 --> 00:13:05,214
by the liberal and mainstream media and 
trump's rhetoric on migration also 

220
00:13:08,641 --> 00:13:10,950
driven the support of the extreme far 
right.

221
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:13,200
Sometimes the Neo Nazi rally in 
Charlottesville.

222
00:13:13,201 --> 00:13:15,450
It wasn't later condemned by the 
president.

223
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:18,180
He went so far as to say that the were 
very fine.

224
00:13:18,181 --> 00:13:20,100
People on both sides

225
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,410
from Mexico.

226
00:13:23,410 --> 00:13:27,400
Can us too bad on the trump campaign in 
two moments.

227
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:30,570
Trump's rhetoric has also spawned a lot 
of Republican candidates.

228
00:13:30,571 --> 00:13:31,404
This are trying to appeal to the same 
voters that are at the core base of the 

229
00:13:34,831 --> 00:13:38,940
presidents going so far as to state that
they are trumpea than trump,

230
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:39,883
but does it actually work,
but apparently it works pretty well for 

231
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:43,890
those bearing the trump name.
Take,

232
00:13:43,891 --> 00:13:46,680
for example,
the West Virginia Republican primary,

233
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,130
one of the candidates came up with an ad
that was filled to the brim with trump's

234
00:13:50,131 --> 00:13:51,690
preferred phrases,
the idioms,

235
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,930
and yet still he came up last in the 
race

236
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:56,033
swap.
Captain Mitch Mcconnell has created 

237
00:13:57,281 --> 00:14:00,100
millions of jobs for China people while 
doing so.

238
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:02,140
Mitch has gotten rid of.
In fact,

239
00:14:02,141 --> 00:14:04,810
there's China.
Family has given him tens of millions of

240
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:07,300
dollars.
Micha swamp people are now running false

241
00:14:07,301 --> 00:14:08,530
negative ads against me

242
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:09,603
in order to give you a fuller accounts 
of the trump presidency would kind of 

243
00:14:11,861 --> 00:14:13,990
need a few days.
In the meantime,

244
00:14:13,991 --> 00:14:17,260
considering all this controversy well,
how other Republicans doing,

245
00:14:17,290 --> 00:14:21,460
many political analysts believe that the
democratic blue wave and they crash onto

246
00:14:21,461 --> 00:14:22,294
these midterm elections,
but is it only a reaction to trump 

247
00:14:25,391 --> 00:14:29,950
scandals or the democratic inclined 
voters more energized?

248
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:42,570
Republicans are losing 2018 midterm 
money wars

249
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:43,523
as reported by CNN.
The GOP is worried about these incoming 

250
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:47,790
midterm elections.
In that piece,

251
00:14:47,791 --> 00:14:51,710
CNN reported that senior members of the 
party are wanting the younger members to

252
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,663
accumulate as many donations as possible
in order to be able to successfully run 

253
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:58,690
campaigns in a difficult political 
culture.

254
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:02,330
Suffice it to say that in the is most 
competitive house races,

255
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:03,253
40 Republicans have been outraged by 
that democratic challenges with our 

256
00:15:06,591 --> 00:15:07,424
speaker,
Paul Ryan's abrupt access to the 

257
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,940
Republican corporate donor base was a 
bit shaken,

258
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,960
a number of party donors and operatives 
believed that the speaker's acts.

259
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:17,390
It was the final piece of evidence that 
they needed to flip their attention from

260
00:15:17,391 --> 00:15:18,224
the house to the Senate,
and that means empty house wallets for 

261
00:15:20,451 --> 00:15:21,284
House Republicans,
which will pretty much be left to fend 

262
00:15:23,121 --> 00:15:23,954
for themselves.

263
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:30,000
But

264
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,100
we need to remember that when it comes 
to politics,

265
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:35,190
nothing is written in stone.
We have visual politic.

266
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:38,370
We're going to be keeping a close eye on
these upcoming midterms,

267
00:15:38,490 --> 00:15:40,010
but as always,
you do need to run another.

268
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,420
When it comes to politics,
nothing's written in stone.

269
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,333
We have visual politic.
We're getting to pay special attention 

270
00:15:45,150 --> 00:15:47,820
to these upcoming midterms.
So now it's your turn.

271
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:49,980
All the Republicans losing their 
credibility.

272
00:15:49,981 --> 00:15:51,780
Do you think that they're going to lose 
votes?

273
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:55,080
Is a democratic blue wave coming to the 
midterms?

274
