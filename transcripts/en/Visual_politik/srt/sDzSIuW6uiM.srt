1
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:08,113
The country with the highest density of 
famous musicians put our capital in the 

2
00:00:10,831 --> 00:00:11,664
entire world.
Ireland is a country with less than 5 

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:16,800
million inhabitants.
Even Boston has a larger population,

4
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,663
but as small as the population maybe 
Ireland is the cradle of well known 

5
00:00:20,881 --> 00:00:24,350
music like any of the cranberries,
and of course Bano for view.

6
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:25,263
See,

7
00:00:26,950 --> 00:00:29,100
there is another thing that makes 
Ireland's famous as well,

8
00:00:29,101 --> 00:00:29,934
and that's the.
It's the second wealthiest country in 

9
00:00:32,101 --> 00:00:32,934
the eurozone.
Further Irish people have more money 

10
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:38,430
than the British or even the Swiss,
and this is surprising given the just 30

11
00:00:38,431 --> 00:00:41,280
years ago,
Ireland was as poor as Greece.

12
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:42,870
Yep.
You heard that right back then,

13
00:00:42,900 --> 00:00:43,733
one in every five Irish university 
students were emigrating to other 

14
00:00:47,011 --> 00:00:47,940
countries.
Today,

15
00:00:47,941 --> 00:00:51,750
there are more people with Irish blood 
living in the US or Australia than there

16
00:00:51,751 --> 00:00:52,584
are in Ireland

17
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:53,583
self

18
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,223
nonetheless.
Now this country is home to some of the 

19
00:00:59,491 --> 00:01:00,324
world's leading technological companies.
Firms like apple or Google have their 

20
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:06,750
tax headquarters that many of you might 
be thinking now that that simply because

21
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:07,584
of the low taxes there right now,
of course it is absolutely true that 

22
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:13,590
Ireland does offer good fiscal 
conditions for companies,

23
00:01:13,591 --> 00:01:14,424
but other countries like the Republic of
Liberia or the seashells also offer 

24
00:01:17,251 --> 00:01:21,450
pretty low corporate taxes and then not 
even half as rich as ours.

25
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:28,780
The question here is,
what have they done to grow so fast?

26
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,030
How is it that even after the financial 
crisis,

27
00:01:31,031 --> 00:01:32,990
Ireland remains wealthier than 
Switzerland?

28
00:01:33,220 --> 00:01:35,020
Did I?
We're going to answer this question,

29
00:01:35,021 --> 00:01:35,854
but first as usual,
we're going to take a look at the 

30
00:01:36,851 --> 00:01:37,684
history.

31
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:42,040
The poorest of the wealthiest

32
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:43,043
islands was born in 1922 years,
but before that the whole island was 

33
00:01:45,661 --> 00:01:49,020
part of the British crown.
I ended the relationship well.

34
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,420
It wasn't exactly great for the English 
politicians.

35
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:52,254
Island was a lens of Catholic peasants 
who were unwilling to work and devoted 

36
00:01:55,141 --> 00:01:55,974
to having lots and lots of children.
This explains why after they got their 

37
00:01:58,441 --> 00:02:00,570
independence,
the New Republic of Ireland is cut.

38
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:02,220
All of that ties with London.
Well,

39
00:02:02,221 --> 00:02:06,030
actually it wasn't just London,
they closed off their relationships with

40
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:11,031
the rest of the world as well.
Even during World War Two,

41
00:02:12,291 --> 00:02:15,410
they were the only English speaking 
country that captain neutral,

42
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,273
but not only that,
the different Irish governments closed 

43
00:02:18,461 --> 00:02:22,460
their gates to international trade.
They even put a ban on foreign as owning

44
00:02:22,461 --> 00:02:25,160
or investing in local companies.
So now the question is,

45
00:02:25,161 --> 00:02:27,380
what was the outcome of all of these 
policies?

46
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,273
Well,
he knows that that would be a brutal 

47
00:02:29,301 --> 00:02:30,350
economic crisis.

48
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,760
Fortunately enough,
because Irish people spoke English,

49
00:02:32,761 --> 00:02:34,830
they could easily move to the United 
States.

50
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:39,890
We're not talking about adventure just a
few decades.

51
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:44,323
The Irish population reduced by half,
and of course the national industry 

52
00:02:47,751 --> 00:02:51,290
never grew as it was expected to think 
about it in such a small country,

53
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,183
it is impossible to find the tools and 
resources needed to build factories and 

54
00:02:55,851 --> 00:02:58,100
machines.
There just isn't enough industry.

55
00:02:58,130 --> 00:03:00,160
They needed to import them,
but because

56
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:04,090
the government put so many fairs and 
barriers to foreign trade,

57
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:07,450
it was pretty hard to get the material 
needed to start a new company.

58
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:08,313
This was in 1957.
The governments of Shawn Thomas Kelly 

59
00:03:10,930 --> 00:03:13,810
made islands town or one 80 on that 
trade policy.

60
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:14,943
This is how they went from not buying 
anything that's opening their gates to 

61
00:03:17,861 --> 00:03:22,861
the entire world.
Right after that,

62
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:25,123
they signed a free trade agreement with 
the UK and a decade later they would 

63
00:03:27,381 --> 00:03:28,214
enter the European community,
which later came to be called the 

64
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:32,900
European Union,
but hold on just a minute.

65
00:03:32,901 --> 00:03:33,790
My Dad,
Libertarians,

66
00:03:33,860 --> 00:03:36,500
he might be watching this video,
just hold back here and things,

67
00:03:36,501 --> 00:03:37,334
the them for a moment because this 
openness to free trade was not exactly 

68
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:42,610
as good as expected.

69
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,180
Think about it.

70
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:49,270
For decades,
Ireland was closed for business.

71
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,940
I had nationalized many of their 
companies.

72
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:54,940
When a company knows that they have no 
rivals in the market,

73
00:03:54,941 --> 00:03:59,410
share is guaranteed by the government.
They have very little reason to improve.

74
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,333
This explains,
for instance why in 1988 people in the 

75
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:03,784
city of Cork,
which is in the southern part of 

76
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,273
Ireland,
had so many electricity breakdowns and 

77
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,303
brownouts,
they're wiring network hadn't been 

78
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:11,764
replaced for decades.
The same happened in many other 

79
00:04:14,321 --> 00:04:15,154
industries.

80
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,790
All of a sudden the Irish economy 
allowed people to buy goods abroad,

81
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:23,010
new products,
more competitive products.

82
00:04:23,011 --> 00:04:23,844
They appeared in the market.
So now you're probably wondering what 

83
00:04:26,191 --> 00:04:28,530
happened to those local producers?
Well,

84
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,733
unsurprisingly they disappeared.
Ends with thousands of people just lost 

85
00:04:33,621 --> 00:04:36,890
their jobs.
In 1987 islands reached and unemployment

86
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,070
rate up seventeen cents.
Once again,

87
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:42,270
the Irish youth started packing up and 
moving.

88
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,323
Yeah.

89
00:04:46,930 --> 00:04:49,090
Then following visual politics for some 
assignment,

90
00:04:49,110 --> 00:04:49,943
you'll probably know that integration 
isn't really much of a problem for our 

91
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:54,490
country.
Can you guess what the real issue is?

92
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,920
Well,
actually it's exactly the opposite.

93
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:00,610
The migration we need to consider is who
was leaving audience,

94
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,090
but it was the university students and 
it was those people with higher skills.

95
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,270
This cause what is known as a brand,
but believe me,

96
00:05:12,401 --> 00:05:15,760
there's more than this in order to 
attract the multinational corporations,

97
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,350
the government,
lower taxes,

98
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,720
and of course this strategy worked out 
well.

99
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,920
Firms like Intel,
apple,

100
00:05:20,921 --> 00:05:21,754
Microsoft,
they chose Ireland as the place for 

101
00:05:22,961 --> 00:05:25,850
their European headquarters.
So now you might be wondering why.

102
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:27,610
What's the problem with this?
This sounds great.

103
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,563
Well,
they essentially just opens up a tiny 

104
00:05:30,071 --> 00:05:30,904
office with an accountant.
This means that their contribution to 

105
00:05:33,041 --> 00:05:34,930
the country's wealth was actually funny.

106
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,240
Paul,
if

107
00:05:38,250 --> 00:05:39,083
this was not enough,
the same government that put the red 

108
00:05:40,501 --> 00:05:44,310
carpet out the companies was also 
raising income tax on it citizens.

109
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:48,210
Some people ended up paying 60 percent 
in tax from their salaries,

110
00:05:48,260 --> 00:05:49,093
and if this was not enough,
Irish legislation did not make it easy 

111
00:05:51,361 --> 00:05:53,790
to hire people.
So now considering the situation,

112
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,580
jobs are disappearing,
local companies are going bankrupt.

113
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,443
Government spending is on the rise and 
thousands of Irish people just leaving 

114
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:02,210
the country.
In 1988,

115
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:04,280
the Economist magazine published this.

116
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:06,093
Yeah,

117
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,903
of the rich.
Poor Ireland behaved as though it was 

118
00:06:11,221 --> 00:06:13,740
rich.
Now it must pay the price.

119
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,341
All right?
All right.

120
00:06:14,341 --> 00:06:16,230
All right,
so that's the bad stuff covered.

121
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,780
Now,
how did they step out of the scenario?

122
00:06:19,170 --> 00:06:20,910
Well,
let me tell you a story.

123
00:06:27,500 --> 00:06:32,060
The Celtic Tiger roars.
It was the in 1987 and Charles Hall,

124
00:06:32,061 --> 00:06:35,880
he had won the elections in Ireland as a
country on the edge of collapse.

125
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:36,773
Mansi realized something.
You can't open your economic system 

126
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,080
without first modernizing it.
Of course companies like oracle or HP,

127
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:43,943
what happened to be an islands and pay 
less taxes than they were paying in the 

128
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,710
us,
but where are they willing to?

129
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,563
I've been a research center.
We're a factory that would employ a 

130
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:54,150
thousand people we have who isn't and 
why?

131
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:55,073
Well,
first they would have to deal with the 

132
00:06:55,501 --> 00:06:57,990
labor laws,
which were a bureaucratic nightmare.

133
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,553
Not only that,
what you said about the 60 percent 

134
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:03,623
income tax.
This means that no matter how high the 

135
00:07:05,130 --> 00:07:05,963
salaries for the worker were,
a fairly large chunk of that is still 

136
00:07:08,731 --> 00:07:09,564
going to the governor.

137
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,410
Highly skilled professionals would 
rather just moved to the United States.

138
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:20,303
So the first policy implemented by Jorge
was to deal with trade unions and the 

139
00:07:24,121 --> 00:07:24,954
company's salaries would grow at the 
same rate as the economy was on the 

140
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,600
other hands.
He lowered income taxes this way.

141
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,010
What has ended up making more money,
even if the wages were the same and this

142
00:07:35,011 --> 00:07:35,844
soon started generating right salts.
Packard like slipped plant is to employ 

143
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:44,120
2000 people by the year.
2,000

144
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,013
in a short amount of all of those 
multinational companies that it opens 

145
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,313
their fiscal headquarters on,
Irish soil started owning that own 

146
00:07:51,420 --> 00:07:53,180
factories and offices.
Meanwhile,

147
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:54,540
unemployment,
it was going down,

148
00:07:54,541 --> 00:07:57,390
wages were on the rise and even the 
government collected more money,

149
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:00,780
but not only that,
this deal with the unions and theocratic

150
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,390
simplification helped create all new 
company.

151
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:10,890
Have you ever played with

152
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,710
Ron at both the t shirt at prime,
arc drunk and Guinness?

153
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:14,663
Well,
all of these companies expanded 

154
00:08:15,781 --> 00:08:20,310
internationally during those years.
This explains why the Irish economy grew

155
00:08:20,311 --> 00:08:21,144
as much as the Chinese economy during 
the 19 nineties suddenly addresses in 

156
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:26,640
Dublin would offer champagne to their 
customers.

157
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:29,760
Some people even flying to New York to 
do shopping on the weekends.

158
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:32,640
These were the years of the Celtic Tiger
and at that point,

159
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:37,670
the economist decided to dedicate 
another article a decade ago,

160
00:08:38,701 --> 00:08:41,790
Irish and comes with less than two 
thirds of British incomes.

161
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:42,713
Last year by one measure,
they had surpassed British incomes that 

162
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,990
hold on just a moment because not 
everything is so perfect.

163
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,700
Of course,
during those 15 years,

164
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,563
salaries doubles,
but that optimism drove banks to offer 

165
00:08:53,611 --> 00:08:54,444
mortgages to nearly is encouraged,
ridiculous spending in those years were 

166
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,243
even companies that rented helicopters 
for children to have their first 

167
00:09:01,411 --> 00:09:02,390
communion in the.

168
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:03,343
Yeah,

169
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:06,863
and this led to a financial crisis that 
we are going to cover that in another 

170
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:11,580
video.

The question is,

176
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:26,013
do you think that the Irish model could 
help other countries like Greece or 

177
00:09:28,391 --> 00:09:29,224
perhaps India?
Do you think poor countries could 

178
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,370
benefit from attracting foreign 
investments?

179
