1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,320
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:09,980
Israel does not have the world's biggest
army bus.

3
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:11,740
It is the most effective.
Think about it,

4
00:00:11,741 --> 00:00:15,280
we are talking about the country with 
less than 9 million inhabitants.

5
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,293
Nonetheless,
they have won wars against countries 10 

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:20,110
times bigger.
For example,

7
00:00:20,111 --> 00:00:20,944
during the six days war,
Israel confronted a coalition that 

8
00:00:22,811 --> 00:00:24,970
included Egypt,
Syria and Jordan.

9
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:29,153
These countries put together sums up to 
more than 130 million people and they 

10
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:37,791
sent over 240,000 soldiers twice as many
as the Israeli army debt.

11
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:39,263
In other words,
no one would expect a victory for 

12
00:00:40,681 --> 00:00:41,514
Israel.
That history was rather difference in 

13
00:00:45,731 --> 00:00:50,110
just six days of the Israeli defense 
forces also known as IDF wiped out their

14
00:00:50,111 --> 00:00:52,960
enemies and yes,
I know where you're going to say now the

15
00:00:52,961 --> 00:00:55,360
Israelis have the best technology and 
weaponry,

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:56,253
right?
Well,

17
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:58,360
that is true now,
but it wasn't back then.

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:01,180
For instance,
in 1973 during the Yom Kippur war,

19
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,360
Israel's weapons where as modern as 
those of their main rivals,

20
00:01:04,361 --> 00:01:07,280
Syria.
In fact,

21
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,163
the IDF had some combat jets 
manufactured in the 1950s the famous a 

22
00:01:12,011 --> 00:01:13,510
four Skyhawk.
However,

23
00:01:13,511 --> 00:01:14,344
the Syrians,
they had state of the art anti aircraft 

24
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:18,550
to isles.
They were given to the Soviets just five

25
00:01:18,551 --> 00:01:20,710
years before.
And you won that wall.

26
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:21,880
Yeah,
it was Israel.

27
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:22,511
All right.
All right,

28
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:23,860
so I can hear something you're saying 
no.

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:24,431
Oh,
come on.

30
00:01:24,431 --> 00:01:26,590
Sign.
But Israel has the sport of America.

31
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:28,240
That's a really big help.

32
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,930
And yes,
at this point you are right.

33
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:37,080
Israel is the country that receives the 
most help from Uncle Sam.

34
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,370
But do you know of any other country who
buys the best weaponry from America?

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,020
Well,
that would be Saudi Arabia.

36
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:46,800
The Saudi's have an army as big and as 
modern as the Israeli one.

37
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,860
But if you've been subscribed to visual 
politic for a while and you already know

38
00:01:49,861 --> 00:01:53,280
that the big failure of the Saudi army 
was fighting guerrilla warriors,

39
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:56,730
namely those who see rebels from Yemen.
In other words,

40
00:01:56,731 --> 00:02:00,450
neither the technology nor the 
American's support are enough to explain

41
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,150
why the Israeli army is such a fearful.
Yeah.

42
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:10,030
So the question of the day is why is the
Israeli army so powerful?

43
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,720
What are the key elements explaining 
such military success?

44
00:02:13,870 --> 00:02:14,703
Well,
today we are going to tell you the five 

45
00:02:16,121 --> 00:02:21,121
key facts that explain this fast 
decision making.

46
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,060
Every almay is based on hierarchy and 
authority,

47
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:27,170
right?
Well,

48
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,690
some of them,
they're more flexible than others.

49
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:30,583
In this other video,
we explained how the Saudi army and has 

50
00:02:32,871 --> 00:02:33,704
a bigger sense of hierarchy and the 
officials don't have much power to make 

51
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:37,604
their own decisions.
The same goes with other Arabic 

52
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,980
countries like Syria or Egypt.
It's like,

53
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:42,833
here is an example.
Imagine a Syrian unit defending a 

54
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:45,614
position.
Let's say the headquarters have been 

55
00:02:46,941 --> 00:02:49,490
destroyed before the soldiers in the 
front line are aware of it.

56
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,333
That's

57
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:53,210
if they have to follow the normal 
procedure.

58
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,600
They will have to wait until someone 
gives them an order during this time,

59
00:02:56,660 --> 00:02:59,290
they don't know if they should retreat,
strike back,

60
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,110
or coordinate with other military units.
All right,

61
00:03:02,111 --> 00:03:03,370
so now you might be wondering,
well,

62
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:05,740
why are Arab armies so centralized?
No,

63
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:06,574
don't forget the,
most of these countries aren't 

64
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
dictatorships or absolute monarchies.
If you are a higher and you want your 

65
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,394
army to be under control in order to 
micromanage every little decision in 

66
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:19,740
order to prevent acute attack,
he is rainy.

67
00:03:19,741 --> 00:03:23,940
Ami is way different from that.
Let's look back to our previous example.

68
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,833
In this case,
the is rainy commander on the front 

69
00:03:26,281 --> 00:03:28,260
line.
Would it need to wait for orders?

70
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,760
He has a degree of his own decision 
making power so he can react immediately

71
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,770
and seize opportunities.
In fact,

72
00:03:34,771 --> 00:03:37,650
this is pretty normal in almost all 
western armies.

73
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:41,340
The big planning is centralized,
but the execution is decentralized.

74
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:44,310
This way the organization is more 
flexible and can react more right

75
00:03:44,410 --> 00:03:45,243
quickly.

76
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,543
Unlike the western countries,
Israel has something unique in that 

77
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:52,754
culture.
We all talking about a pretty unknown 

78
00:03:54,351 --> 00:03:55,690
fact about this country.
Yes,

79
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:58,490
it is a very,
very important one.

80
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,353
Israel is the least hierarchical country
on the planet and you can feel this in 

81
00:04:03,380 --> 00:04:06,560
every aspect of their culture inside of 
an Israeli company.

82
00:04:06,561 --> 00:04:07,394
It's pretty normal for an average worker
to have a discussion with his boss 

83
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:14,180
debate site a common thing and there is 
a pretty small sense of authority.

84
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:17,343
Actually in the 1970s of Dutch 
anthropologist named Geert Hofstetter 

85
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:23,710
studied the power relationships in 
different countries.

86
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:24,603
Over the course of six years,
he surveyed ibm workers in different 

87
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:31,810
offices around the globe.
This is how the power distance index was

88
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:33,760
born,
and among all those countries,

89
00:04:33,790 --> 00:04:34,623
Israel has the lowest power distance.
While the Arab countries like Egypt or 

90
00:04:38,291 --> 00:04:41,680
Saudi Arabia rank among the highest.
In other words,

91
00:04:41,681 --> 00:04:45,650
Israeli citizens are educated in 
flexibility more than any other nation.

92
00:04:45,651 --> 00:04:46,484
Yeah,
internal cohesion in Israel military 

93
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,534
service is mandatory for every citizen 
regardless of their social condition or 

94
00:04:54,021 --> 00:04:55,790
that gender.
Both men and women,

95
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:57,810
rich and poor start from the very

96
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,733
awesome.

97
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,463
Well,
actually this is not entirely true 

98
00:05:05,521 --> 00:05:06,354
because the ultra orthodox Jews don't 
need to do military service and neither 

99
00:05:09,091 --> 00:05:09,924
does Israel's Palestinian population,
but the rest of Israel citizens must 

100
00:05:13,261 --> 00:05:16,590
serve in the military and fall into a 
meritocratic scheme.

101
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,970
This means everyone must follow the same
rules in order to be promoted,

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:24,120
and this is not as common as you might 
think.

103
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,650
For instance,
during World War II,

104
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:26,484
the aristocrats grants who joined the 
British army started with higher 

105
00:05:28,441 --> 00:05:31,200
positions and the peasants and the 
working class.

106
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:37,890
As of course,
it's such elitism,

107
00:05:37,891 --> 00:05:41,490
it tends to destroy an army's morale and
make it harder for it to function.

108
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,383
For example,
the Saudi army consists of both civil 

109
00:05:44,161 --> 00:05:46,500
sevenths ams,
members of the royal family.

110
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,603
As hierarchy matters a lot.
The son of the Saudi prince will be a 

111
00:05:57,531 --> 00:05:59,240
soldier,
and as you can imagine,

112
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:02,360
this classist structure has negative 
consequences.

113
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:07,990
Combat

114
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,220
morale.
In the,

115
00:06:09,221 --> 00:06:13,630
in 1973 Israel forced the Egyptian and 
the Syrian army at the same time.

116
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,790
As we said at the beginning,
back then,

117
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:19,240
Israel was not the technological 
powerhouse that it is today.

118
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:20,133
Syrians had those antiaircraft guns,
the Sdu hundreds that we mentioned 

119
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:24,520
before,
and during the first days,

120
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:28,870
those anti aircraft missiles destroyed a
lot of Israeli combat jets,

121
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:33,670
Israel answer retreat.
Nonetheless,

122
00:06:33,671 --> 00:06:34,504
Uncle Sam was here to help.
The White House sends a package of 

123
00:06:36,401 --> 00:06:39,520
weapons so they could neutralize the Sdu
hundreds and the radars,

124
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,533
things like flags that could confuse the
smart missiles that would guide it by 

125
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:43,954
temperature this way.
The Israeli struck back and in a short 

126
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:51,480
amount of time they finished off the 
Syrian defenses as well.

127
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:53,040
Guess what happened next?
Well,

128
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:56,460
the loss of those Arab soldiers scared 
of being wiped out from the air.

129
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,760
Well,
they defected.

130
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,870
If you look at the picture on the 
screen,

131
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,260
you will see seven Syrian tanks.
They are not moving,

132
00:07:07,290 --> 00:07:12,290
but not one of them is destroyed.
Well,

133
00:07:12,751 --> 00:07:15,300
it means that the soldiers that were 
inside of those tanks,

134
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,193
they decided to run away.
Defection is a common problem when 

135
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:19,974
morale is low,
and this is a common problem for Arab 

136
00:07:22,351 --> 00:07:22,730
army

137
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:23,563
s

138
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,210
Syrian troops defect to southern Turkish
province of Hottie.

139
00:07:28,330 --> 00:07:29,163
Think about it.
If you aren't an Israeli soldier or an 

140
00:07:30,911 --> 00:07:31,744
American one,
you know you must be loyal to your 

141
00:07:33,731 --> 00:07:36,850
country,
but Arab soldiers have too many ethnic,

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,580
national,
and religious identity.

143
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:42,733
Imagine you are a Syrian soldiers and at
the same time you are occurs or you 

144
00:07:45,891 --> 00:07:46,724
belong to the Muslim Brotherhood.
Both groups aren't chased by the Syrian 

145
00:07:49,371 --> 00:07:51,590
government so well.
Who were your loyalty?

146
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,753
Of course the army pays your bills,
but when your life is a risk and 

147
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,080
everything is lost,
when what's more important?

148
00:07:57,470 --> 00:07:58,303
Your salary,

149
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,363
life,

150
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,760
no matter your wealth and your 
technology.

151
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,160
If your soldiers are not strongly 
motivated,

152
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,380
you've already lost ans the Israelis,
they know that better than anyone.

153
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:19,380
Capitol old tanks place their engines on
the backside,

154
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:22,410
but why is this?
Because usually the rocket center on the

155
00:08:22,411 --> 00:08:23,244
front side,
Angie wants your tank to keep working 

156
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:25,913
even after being hit.
This is why all the models from the 

157
00:08:28,231 --> 00:08:32,640
German leopards do the Russian tea 
nineties keep that engine's in the back.

158
00:08:32,730 --> 00:08:33,563
Nonetheless,
the Israeli army doesn't value the 

159
00:08:34,981 --> 00:08:35,814
vehicle as much as their soldiers.
This is why the Israeli mccarver is the 

160
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:42,360
only one of its kinds of,
that has the engine's in the front.

161
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,130
This

162
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,540
way,
a rocket will destroy the tank,

163
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,120
but it will protect the soldiers.
Putting aside the ethics,

164
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,073
Israel has a really small population.
This means that they can't allow 

165
00:08:53,481 --> 00:08:54,314
themselves to lose too many soldiers.
This is why they receive much more 

166
00:08:57,421 --> 00:09:00,630
intense training with real bullets and 
better equipment.

167
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:03,630
And don't forget that this is the 
country where craft mudguard one,

168
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:05,790
it's the most advanced martial arts was 
born.

169
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,630
You can also see this human capital 
doctrine reflected in their intelligence

170
00:09:09,631 --> 00:09:10,740
service.
The massage,

171
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:13,710
it is considered one of the best in the 
entire world.

172
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:14,693
Wow.

173
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:18,123
One day you happen to travel to Israel 
and you should know that they will take 

174
00:09:20,621 --> 00:09:24,490
your phone number and other data because
they know information is power.

175
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:26,900
Yep.

176
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,561
All right.
All right.

177
00:09:27,561 --> 00:09:28,520
I know what you want to hit.
Now,

178
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,413
you came to this video because you 
wanted to hear about state of the art 

179
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:32,720
weaponry,
Rice.

180
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:34,010
Well,
Hey,

181
00:09:34,011 --> 00:09:34,844
you have this made in Israel during the 
1980 it's the Israeli government wanted 

182
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,943
a secret weapon,
a weapon no one had ever heard of until 

183
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:49,634
recently.
So they met our local manufacturer or 

184
00:09:51,801 --> 00:09:55,610
company called Rafael.
Do you design a very special vehicle?

185
00:09:55,750 --> 00:09:56,810
The so called para.

186
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,100
This is a vehicle that looks like a 
tank,

187
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:02,934
but in fact,
as a tank hunter weapon with a big 

188
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,840
rocket launch chat,
if you know about weapons,

189
00:10:06,841 --> 00:10:09,730
you know there's a big difference.
Tank weaponry has to reach a distance of

190
00:10:09,731 --> 00:10:10,564
between two and four kilometers.
Perrier rockets can travel and distance 

191
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,333
of 30 so imagine the situation.
The enemies would take satellite 

192
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:18,384
pictures to see the Israeli weaponry.
And as they would see a lot of normal 

193
00:10:20,941 --> 00:10:23,640
tax based on this,
they would turn their strategy,

194
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:24,563
but then surprise,
surprise those tanks on not tanks and 

195
00:10:26,841 --> 00:10:27,601
bars.
In fact,

196
00:10:27,601 --> 00:10:29,820
something with a much,
much bigger,

197
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:30,070
right?

198
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:30,903
Sure.

199
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,253
The decades this para was one of the 
most mysterious weapons if the Israeli 

200
00:10:38,341 --> 00:10:42,120
army and their main strength was that no
one knew anything about them.

201
00:10:42,210 --> 00:10:43,043
So now the question is how come Israel 
makes it's own secret weapons and other 

202
00:10:46,321 --> 00:10:47,460
countries don't?
Well,

203
00:10:47,461 --> 00:10:48,294
the answer is that in Israel there are a
lot of rocket science companies that 

204
00:10:50,731 --> 00:10:51,564
give it a worldclass defense industry.
So a while ago we did a video about 

205
00:10:54,750 --> 00:10:56,280
Israeli startups.
Well.

206
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:57,143
In the 1980s the Israeli government 
created a special program which was 

207
00:10:59,881 --> 00:11:03,330
called a yells map.
This program consisted of 10 hedge funds

208
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:05,730
with both private and government money 
in them.

209
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,893
Those funds helps to create a lot of 
tech companies and you know what the 

210
00:11:09,691 --> 00:11:11,970
favorite industry for those brand new 
startups was?

211
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,730
Well,
of course it was the military industry.

212
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,470
At the end of the day,
the army,

213
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,140
it was a rich and reliable clients.
All of a sudden,

214
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:20,123
dozens of weapons manufacturers were 
born companies that created customized 

215
00:11:22,710 --> 00:11:26,540
products that met the exact needs of the
Israeli army at every

216
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:27,473
moment.

217
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:34,370
Iron don't defense system to the Merkaba
tanks or the parade we mentioned before.

218
00:11:34,750 --> 00:11:37,010
Now you might be wondering what happens 
in the other countries.

219
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,870
Well,
let's first consider Saudi Arabia.

220
00:11:38,990 --> 00:11:40,370
As you note,
the sound of your economy.

221
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:43,430
It's got a problem.
It relies heavily on the oil industry.

222
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:45,080
Of course,
thanks to the dinosaur juice.

223
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:45,914
The Saudis have become a rich and they 
can pay for the third biggest army in 

224
00:11:49,191 --> 00:11:52,130
the world,
only surpassed by China and America.

225
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,500
Expensive is not a synonym for good.
The Saudi army buys their tanks from the

226
00:12:00,501 --> 00:12:01,334
USA ends.
Those are customized for the needs of 

227
00:12:03,021 --> 00:12:05,750
the American army.
Like does that makes it harder to have a

228
00:12:05,751 --> 00:12:06,584
secret weapon because everyone knows 
what you bought on the international 

229
00:12:08,991 --> 00:12:13,620
market.
All right,

230
00:12:13,621 --> 00:12:14,820
so I probably know what you're thinking.
Now.

231
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:17,340
It seems that we're really talking up 
the Israelis rice,

232
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,353
but do you make no mistake,
the Israeli army certainly has its weak 

233
00:12:20,641 --> 00:12:21,510
points.
In fact,

234
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:24,270
there is an organization that could make
their life even harder,

235
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,990
but that's something we're going to talk
about in another video.

236
00:12:30,950 --> 00:12:31,200
Nope.

237
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,033
The question for you is who do you think
can defeat the Israeli army and what do 

238
00:12:35,101 --> 00:12:37,080
you think their main weak point saw?
What?
