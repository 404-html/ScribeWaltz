1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Did you know that the United States is 
the largest energy power on the 

2
00:00:03,631 --> 00:00:04,410
planet's?
Yep.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,170
That's absolutely right.
The United States has taken the position

4
00:00:07,171 --> 00:00:10,140
as the world's largest fossil fuel 
producer.

5
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:13,290
No other country,
not even Russia or Saudi Arabia.

6
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:16,860
Even come close to this North American 
giants.

7
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,980
The golden era of American energy is now
underway.

8
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,160
This energy revolution is having 
important consequences and it's changing

9
00:00:26,161 --> 00:00:26,994
politics in the USA and it's also the 
topic that we're addressing in this 

10
00:00:29,971 --> 00:00:34,971
visual politic video.
Just eight years ago,

11
00:00:39,991 --> 00:00:43,710
the supply of petrol and natural gas was
one of the biggest concerns that the USA

12
00:00:43,711 --> 00:00:44,544
had about their future.
And this wasn't a particularly new 

13
00:00:47,071 --> 00:00:47,904
concern.
The country had been dependent on 

14
00:00:49,051 --> 00:00:51,640
foreign petrol and gas for decades.

15
00:00:57,380 --> 00:00:58,213
The other thing is that we have only 
leased out and began to explore two 

16
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:07,571
percent of our outer continental shelf 
for oil where it is believed by everyone

17
00:01:08,331 --> 00:01:12,110
familiar with that few will and that 
source of energy,

18
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,420
that there are vast supplies you have to
be found.

19
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:15,561
Uh,
secondly,

20
00:01:15,561 --> 00:01:18,050
we need an active exploration program in
market.

21
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:18,884
They only way to become less dependent 
on foreign sources of crude oil is to 

22
00:01:21,471 --> 00:01:26,471
explore at home.
I think we can easily within seven,

23
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,530
eight,
10 years if we put our minds to it,

24
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:31,723
we can eliminate our dependence on the 
places in the world that our national 

25
00:01:35,631 --> 00:01:36,464
security,
if we don't achieve our independence 

26
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,503
from the most important thing we can do 
is to make sure we control our own 

27
00:01:44,991 --> 00:01:47,360
energy.
So here's what I've done since I've been

28
00:01:47,361 --> 00:01:48,194
president.
We have increased oil production to the 

29
00:01:51,771 --> 00:01:52,604
highest levels in 16 years.
At the time it was said that the 

30
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:55,814
national security over the US,
they rely on being able to ensure the 

31
00:01:58,701 --> 00:02:01,910
supply of natural gas and petrol to the 
industry and economy.

32
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:06,940
That we're so dependent upon it and this
well,

33
00:02:08,041 --> 00:02:09,990
it wasn't really easy to do at that 
time.

34
00:02:09,991 --> 00:02:10,824
It's possible you might remember this.
The world's seem to be facing an 

35
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:13,733
imminent decline in fossil fuels.
It really did seem as if we were about 

36
00:02:17,521 --> 00:02:20,340
to run out of them.
Let's have a quick look at the situation

37
00:02:20,370 --> 00:02:22,170
in the USAID.
Back at that time

38
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:25,093
from the early seventies,
the petro reserves in the United States 

39
00:02:27,291 --> 00:02:28,124
were declining year after year 
production had dropped by about 50 

40
00:02:31,011 --> 00:02:34,190
percent and even the production of 
natural gas was starting to decline.

41
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:37,003
In other words,
the United States was quickly running 

42
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,014
out of energy resources and they were at
risk of having to rely on suppliers 

43
00:02:42,230 --> 00:02:43,063
well,
when it's exactly trustworthy in the 

44
00:02:44,631 --> 00:02:47,450
opinion of those responsible for 
national security.

45
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:50,270
We are of course talking about countries
like Saudi Arabia,

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:51,143
Russia and Nigeria.
However things they've changed a lot 

47
00:02:54,801 --> 00:02:55,634
since then and as sometimes happens,
the predictions were wrong and creamed 

48
00:02:58,361 --> 00:03:00,570
storage tanks,
the world all continue,

49
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,503
Phil.

50
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:05,040
Well,
what exactly is happening?

51
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:07,080
Well,
let's take a closer look at that.

52
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:11,333
Petrol power returns.
United States has gone through an 

53
00:03:15,351 --> 00:03:17,990
important energy revolution.
In the last few years.

54
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,853
Oil production has almost doubled,
and the reserves which can be exploited 

55
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:24,710
guarantee that supply for many years to 
come.

56
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:27,380
Look at this chart that we've taken from
the Wall Street Journal.

57
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:31,940
It shows the increase of oil production 
in the USA since 2011.

58
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,760
You can probably guess the fact that the
USA has almost doubled.

59
00:03:37,761 --> 00:03:38,594
It's all production is closely related 
to the huge drops in oil prices since 

60
00:03:42,141 --> 00:03:46,870
2004,
not just the petrol.

61
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:50,320
Something really similar that has 
happened with natural gas as well.

62
00:03:50,350 --> 00:03:51,183
Today.
The US is the world's largest producer 

63
00:03:52,931 --> 00:03:55,930
of both of these resources and as you 
can imagine,

64
00:03:55,931 --> 00:03:56,764
this as consequences on multiple fronts,
but what has happened so that this boom 

65
00:04:00,401 --> 00:04:04,430
could take place.
As many of you know,

66
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,780
it is all due to a technological 
revolution known as fracking.

67
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,580
Well,
it's actually nothing new.

68
00:04:13,581 --> 00:04:14,414
We've known about it for decades,
but until recently it wasn't really 

69
00:04:17,031 --> 00:04:18,770
economically viable.
And look,

70
00:04:18,771 --> 00:04:20,300
before we get into this topic any 
further,

71
00:04:20,301 --> 00:04:21,134
we need to point out that fracking.
It's a pretty controversial topic and 

72
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:28,340
for now it's only used to produce petrol
on a large scale in four countries,

73
00:04:28,341 --> 00:04:29,480
the US,
Canada,

74
00:04:29,510 --> 00:04:31,070
Russia,
and Argentina.

75
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,110
At the end of this video and in the 
description below,

76
00:04:33,111 --> 00:04:33,944
we're actually going to leave a link to 
something that will explain how this 

77
00:04:35,961 --> 00:04:36,794
process works in its defense,
would also like to point out that it is 

78
00:04:39,021 --> 00:04:42,320
a pretty new technique and as this 
technique is being used and developed,

79
00:04:42,321 --> 00:04:44,900
its actual impact is being reduced 
anyway.

80
00:04:44,901 --> 00:04:45,734
The safety and that sort of thing is 
actually a discussion for another video 

81
00:04:48,141 --> 00:04:48,974
because in this video we're going to 
focus on both the economic and the 

82
00:04:51,261 --> 00:04:56,261
political consequences of fracking 
feeding the economic engine.

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:00,903
Civil oil imports to the U.
S had been reduced significantly in the 

84
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,143
United States.
Sanders laws of supply and demand 

85
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:09,700
applying all of this additional petrol 
has made the prices drop.

86
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:13,090
This means the lesser amounts of petrol 
that the country is still important,

87
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:18,110
but it's also significantly the price of
gas slash petrol at the pump to faults,

88
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:25,380
so much so that it's actually estimated 
that American consumers are saving about

89
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:26,214
a $150,000,000,000 every year.
This is money that is then used for 

90
00:05:30,061 --> 00:05:30,894
purchasing other products or setting up 
businesses or just putting it into a 

91
00:05:33,031 --> 00:05:36,540
savings accounts,
but hold on a minute because this is not

92
00:05:36,541 --> 00:05:38,610
the end of today's story.
Oh,

93
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:39,473
not even close,
cheaper petrol and gas also benefits 

94
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:45,390
industry and not just those industries 
that use this type of energy,

95
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:48,900
but also industry that uses it as their 
raw material.

96
00:05:51,550 --> 00:05:52,090
Of course

97
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:54,130
now talking about the petro chemical 
industry,

98
00:05:54,131 --> 00:05:54,964
the one that produces plastic and pvc,
the culmination of a large quantity of 

99
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:06,084
petrol available,
the certainty of supply and low prices 

100
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:08,903
are triggering an industrial boom in the
petro chemical sector and it's really 

101
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,193
important to look at these numbers 
closely because that absolutely huge 

102
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:20,233
petrochemical sector is developing 
projects valued at $185 billion dollars 

103
00:06:24,111 --> 00:06:28,890
just in the United States.
20 16.

104
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:29,813
These sorts of projects.
We're 50 percent of the entire national 

105
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:33,114
industrial investment.
It's expected that these investments 

106
00:06:35,101 --> 00:06:38,030
will turn the United States into a great
plastic export

107
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:43,540
just so I can get an idea.
They expect that in just a few years,

108
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:44,374
the net exports of petrol based products
like plastics and also fertilizes and 

109
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,000
solvents will exceed $110,000,000,000 a 
year.

110
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,640
This is almost as much as all of the 
petrol,

111
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,653
Saudi Arabia exports.
You've got to pinch yourself sometimes 

112
00:06:58,991 --> 00:07:01,360
and say,
this is the envy of the world.

113
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,253
Neal Chapman,
president of the chemical division at 

114
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:04,643
Exxonmobil.
It's not your business will certainly 

115
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:06,874
help us reduce that trade deficits,
a deficit that trump is always 

116
00:07:09,731 --> 00:07:12,160
complaining about.
Let's wait a second because,

117
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:14,560
well,
there's yet more the supply of petrol.

118
00:07:14,561 --> 00:07:15,394
It's something no longer a priority or a
concern for the countries and national 

119
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:18,844
security.
In December 2015 us Congress moved the 

120
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,220
prohibition on exports of natural gas 
and petrol.

121
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:25,400
Now

122
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,540
the US is about to become a net exporter
of natural gas and it is calculated that

123
00:07:29,541 --> 00:07:34,541
the US will sell an average of 1 million
petrol barrels per day in 2017.

124
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,160
US oil exports double reshaping vast 
global markets.

125
00:07:40,450 --> 00:07:41,283
Well,
the United States still important forum 

126
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,423
petrol,
but much less than it used to because 

127
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:48,890
countries like to have energy security 
by diversifying their sources.

128
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:49,753
Many countries are willing to pay a 
premium for this US supply and you can 

129
00:07:53,361 --> 00:07:54,194
be sure that the companies in the US on 
taking advantage of that natural gas 

130
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:06,040
where this change has been the greatest 
and so recently the transport of gas was

131
00:08:06,041 --> 00:08:08,680
difficult and huge gas pipelines when 
needed,

132
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:12,040
but now thanks to the new technology of 
liquefied natural gas,

133
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:15,010
it can easily be transported like petrol
in giant

134
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,983
tankers.

135
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:20,423
The gas supplied this way is almost half
of the world's supply and here American 

136
00:08:23,941 --> 00:08:24,774
companies are.
The superstars is now projected to be 

137
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:35,900
one of the top three natural gas 
exporters in the world by 20,

138
00:08:35,901 --> 00:08:37,760
20 less importance.
Gas Exports,

139
00:08:37,761 --> 00:08:38,594
a revival of the industrial sector.
It all looks like rather bad timing for 

140
00:08:42,201 --> 00:08:46,580
trump's protectionism.
Well,

141
00:08:46,581 --> 00:08:48,770
hold on just a minute because this 
energy revolution,

142
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:53,830
it also has political consequences 
diplomatically.

143
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,343
Most of all,
to understand the US international 

144
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:08,220
politics.
If we don't consider the impacts of this

145
00:09:08,221 --> 00:09:10,060
energy revolution,
let me explain.

146
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:10,993
I'll console now.
The supply of petrol was a priority for 

147
00:09:13,171 --> 00:09:14,004
national security.
The Middle East and oil and gas 

148
00:09:15,481 --> 00:09:19,210
producing countries had an important 
role in the American diplomatic agenda.

149
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,233
Yeah,

150
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:24,690
petrol scheme of the United States.
This caused priorities to change.

151
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,060
For example,
a new focus has been placed on Asia,

152
00:09:27,090 --> 00:09:30,300
which is we've talked about before,
is a goldmine of opportunity

153
00:09:33,390 --> 00:09:35,310
singly.
Without this change in priorities,

154
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:37,700
Obama would have probably kept the 
troops in Iraq ends.

155
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,950
The situation in Yemen,
Libya or Syria would have been very,

156
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,590
very different,
but let's be really extra clear.

157
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:44,433
Have all of this petroleum means that 
the Middle East is not really that 

158
00:09:46,861 --> 00:09:47,694
important to the United States anymore.
A country that can now even afford to 

159
00:09:50,551 --> 00:09:54,480
support these so called Arab Nato,
which is something pretty much like,

160
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:55,373
okay,
well you and take care of your own 

161
00:09:56,521 --> 00:09:57,354
safety man's.
Every now and then we'll give you a 

162
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,280
hands to hopefully avoid the risk of a 
global crisis or something.

163
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,363
Needless to say,
this energy independence has also given 

164
00:10:06,511 --> 00:10:07,344
Washington the opportunity to place more
demands on the petro monarchies of the 

165
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:11,933
Persian Gulf,
especially when it comes to human 

166
00:10:12,811 --> 00:10:14,280
rights,
and by the way,

167
00:10:14,281 --> 00:10:16,650
if there is something that is absolutely
certain,

168
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,513
it is trump's support for fracking,
the new president and wants to continue 

169
00:10:20,551 --> 00:10:22,370
Obama's work,
but to do it faster,

170
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,290
eliminating any obstacle that might be 
in the way.

171
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,353
Yeah,

172
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:32,240
American Energy First America

173
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:35,660
first,
America first.

174
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:36,713
Donald trump has little doubt.
He made the promise during his campaign 

175
00:10:39,151 --> 00:10:42,060
and has kept his word since taking 
office is priority,

176
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:44,430
has been to give petrol and gas 
developments,

177
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:45,413
the green light,
among other things he promised to 

178
00:10:47,071 --> 00:10:49,680
eliminate many of the rules and 
restrictions Obama passed,

179
00:10:49,681 --> 00:10:52,170
which could cause fracking to slow down 
trump well.

180
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:56,820
He wants cheap petrol panties willing to
push to get it sooner rather than later.

181
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:57,713
Trump has also chosen to surround 
himself with key people closely related 

182
00:11:00,751 --> 00:11:05,550
to the petroleum industry.
As Secretary of state's trump decided to

183
00:11:05,551 --> 00:11:08,580
go for rex Tillerson,
who used to be the CEO of Exxon Mobil.

184
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:13,310
Then there's Rick Perry,
the former governor of Texas,

185
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:15,490
who has been placed in charge of the 
Department of Energy.

186
00:11:15,491 --> 00:11:16,324
Thanks.
This is a stage that is very closely 

187
00:11:17,651 --> 00:11:18,484
related to the industry and then there 
is the head of the US Environmental 

188
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:24,793
Protection Agency,
Scott Pruitt to the attorney general in 

189
00:11:25,761 --> 00:11:27,130
Oklahoma,
another state,

190
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,330
well connected to the petroleum 
industry.

191
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:30,203
Great.

192
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:31,883
Anyway,
this is a revolution that the US is 

193
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:34,074
going through.
I did some revolution that just put 

194
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,790
greater limits on the power of.
Okay,

195
00:11:39,870 --> 00:11:42,960
now there is no question that fracking 
has its risks,

196
00:11:42,961 --> 00:11:46,740
but the reality is is that it's a 
technology that's not going anywhere and

197
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:50,850
it does seem that with time and 
development it's going to become safer,

198
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:51,743
but until that time comes,
environmental controls are absolutely 

199
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:55,613
yes,

200
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:01,330
and now it's your turn.
We'd love to know what you think of this

201
00:12:01,331 --> 00:12:04,360
energy revolution.
Do you think it's the start of a new era

202
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,194
for cheap petrol?
