1
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:10,050
Tina is a country famous for three 
things,

2
00:00:10,051 --> 00:00:13,410
tango,
soccer and economic crises.

3
00:00:13,460 --> 00:00:17,100
Although that latter one might change 
sooner rather than later.

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:18,210
Yes.
Dvo once again,

5
00:00:18,211 --> 00:00:19,044
we aren't talking about lithium or white
gold or the new oil and it's the staff 

6
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:26,310
that have batteries are made out of 
lithium is what powers your smart phone,

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:29,250
your laptop and maybe even your electric
car.

8
00:00:32,570 --> 00:00:33,403
As we said in this other video.
Argentina is alongside with Chile and 

9
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:37,214
Bolivia,
one of the three countries that make up 

10
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:39,614
this so called lithium triangle.
This is an area where 60 to 80% of the 

11
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:46,880
welds discovered lithium reserves are 
concentrated from these three countries.

12
00:00:46,881 --> 00:00:50,240
Argentina is getting the biggest 
detention like international investors.

13
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:54,460
Yup.

14
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:58,050
That writes the biggest hedge funds have
their eyes on this country.

15
00:00:58,440 --> 00:00:59,273
This is a big surprise given the dodge 
and Tina used to be the boogie man of 

16
00:01:02,341 --> 00:01:05,940
finances.
The problem childs of economics now,

17
00:01:05,941 --> 00:01:06,774
well,
it's growing into something of a 

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:12,430
rockstar.
Sorry.

19
00:01:12,431 --> 00:01:13,540
Today's question is,
well,

20
00:01:13,541 --> 00:01:17,030
what happens to this country in which 
improve their image in assumption,

21
00:01:17,031 --> 00:01:17,864
short time?
Can they really become the leader over 

22
00:01:19,991 --> 00:01:22,420
the lithium race is most important of 
all?

23
00:01:22,421 --> 00:01:26,500
Can Lithium turn Argentina into a new 
Abu Darby today?

24
00:01:26,501 --> 00:01:28,600
We all goings on.
So all of these questions,

25
00:01:28,601 --> 00:01:31,730
but before we get started,
let's take a look at the history.

26
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,610
Argentina first.

27
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,573
In the last few years,
Argentina had become something of a 

28
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:38,734
boogie man,
but hedge funds under the presidency of 

29
00:01:40,241 --> 00:01:43,510
Cristina Fernandez de catch.
Now Argentina's governance did it.

30
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:47,440
Whatever they could to scare away any 
foreign company you might want to invest

31
00:01:47,441 --> 00:01:47,780
in the

32
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:52,780
treat tobacco.
Of course it [inaudible]

33
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,540
when it comes to the mining and oil 
industry.

34
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,433
Kirschner made an interesting move.
In 2008 she passed a law against the 

35
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:03,244
repatriation of capital.
This means that if an Australian mining 

36
00:02:06,011 --> 00:02:10,510
company made profit by extracting oil 
and minerals on Argentinian soil,

37
00:02:10,540 --> 00:02:11,373
the government wouldn't allow the 
company to send that money back to 

38
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,284
Australia.
Coach's goal was to force these foreign 

39
00:02:17,781 --> 00:02:21,080
companies to keep the financial benefits
of their mining in the country

40
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,020
math or the last.
As you can imagine,

41
00:02:23,021 --> 00:02:23,854
the consequence of this law was that 
most of the foreign companies simply 

42
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:29,560
stops doing business in the country.
The ends of the day.

43
00:02:29,561 --> 00:02:30,910
I mean,
why would they,

44
00:02:30,911 --> 00:02:33,610
if it was forbidden to enjoy those 
profits at home?

45
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,870
Well,
this,

46
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:35,703
it was not enough.
The real turning point for Argentina 

47
00:02:37,541 --> 00:02:39,670
came in the year 2012

48
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:44,700
Argentina,
x rates ypf to rub salt

49
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,723
repsol all of the largest oil company in
Spain in the year 1998 and merged with 

50
00:02:49,181 --> 00:02:50,014
Arjun time company Y F for many years,
this brands was simply called at Repsol 

51
00:02:55,050 --> 00:02:55,781
Ypf.
But one day,

52
00:02:55,781 --> 00:03:00,040
Cristina Fernandez de Koechner in a very
Donald Trump fashion sense,

53
00:03:00,160 --> 00:03:00,993
well,
Argentina first Hashtag make Argentina 

54
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,330
grades again.
He lets him a key.

55
00:03:06,610 --> 00:03:07,443
How does that stay here?
Even if their shareholders are 

56
00:03:10,241 --> 00:03:14,250
foreigners are Argentinian competence.
Now you might wonder,

57
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:16,010
well,
what happens next?

58
00:03:16,220 --> 00:03:17,053
Well,
of course the repsol pursued several 

59
00:03:18,351 --> 00:03:20,330
lawsuits with the governments of 
Argentina,

60
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:24,230
but this was not the worst thing.
The biggest problem was that after being

61
00:03:24,231 --> 00:03:27,800
nationalized Argentine YDF,
it reduced their oil production.

62
00:03:28,850 --> 00:03:29,683
Oh,

63
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,110
wheel production extends decline as rig 
activity slows.

64
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:38,510
Yeah.
Yeah.

65
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,640
Listen,
I know what you're thinking.

66
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:40,570
You're probably thinking,
well,

67
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:41,433
what's the connection between oil 
production and it's being owned by 

68
00:03:43,871 --> 00:03:46,570
private companies or being owned by the 
governments?

69
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:50,020
I mean there are several states,
oil companies that work really well.

70
00:03:50,140 --> 00:03:50,973
For one example there is Aramco.
This is the biggest dinosaur juice 

71
00:03:53,741 --> 00:03:55,180
producer.
I'm still,

72
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:57,010
it is.
I'm buying the Saudi government's.

73
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:59,800
The problem here is that both in the oil
ams,

74
00:03:59,801 --> 00:04:02,380
the mining industry,
you need high tech.

75
00:04:02,590 --> 00:04:03,423
Yeah.

76
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:08,060
Each company has different technologies 
and patents.

77
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,923
In other words,
when why the f wants it to drill those 

78
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:11,204
oil beds of Baca.
I'm wet and they needed to utilize a 

79
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:18,200
complicated technology called fracking.
I am as well only a few companies in the

80
00:04:18,201 --> 00:04:21,740
wells that have the machines and the 
skills to do this kind of work.

81
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,870
This is why it is so common.
The difference.

82
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,733
Oil companies create a joint venture to 
exploit an oil bat when reps old left 

83
00:04:28,581 --> 00:04:31,520
Argentina,
why p have lost a technology partner and

84
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:32,354
this is why people will say the catch 
near fought against those Spanish near 

85
00:04:34,431 --> 00:04:38,300
Liberals and ended up partnering with 
the American ones.

86
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:41,700
Sure.

87
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:45,420
YPF signed one point $5 billion shale 
oil deal.

88
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,270
Hold on just a second because,
well,

89
00:04:47,310 --> 00:04:48,143
this isn't the end of our story.
The biggest issue here is what happens 

90
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:53,520
when you take over a company from one 
day to the other.

91
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,413
Well,
what happens is the rest of the 

92
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:58,950
businesses are going to be afraid of you
and good luck trying to convince them to

93
00:04:58,951 --> 00:05:03,951
invest in your country.
Think about it.

94
00:05:04,171 --> 00:05:06,870
Let's imagine you have an oil or a 
mining company.

95
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:07,763
Would you really dead set up a factory 
and the loss of facilities in a place 

96
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,420
where the government can just sees all 
of that from you.

97
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,810
I think not man's this among other 
factors.

98
00:05:15,811 --> 00:05:20,010
This is what explains why Argentina 
today has such a big crisis,

99
00:05:20,070 --> 00:05:22,280
but now Argentina has a president called
Maury,

100
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,080
Theo Macri man's well,
the times they are a changing.

101
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:28,353
Okay.

102
00:05:31,950 --> 00:05:32,783
Gold rush in Argentina and December,
2015 macri took his place in the pink 

103
00:05:37,021 --> 00:05:39,150
house.
The Pink House is the elgin time version

104
00:05:39,151 --> 00:05:39,984
of the White House.

105
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:45,160
That was the country I'm

106
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:45,993
tree in the middle of a bankruptcy.
Real inflation was higher than 40% 

107
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:50,133
dollars were sold on the black market 
and there was no company willing to 

108
00:05:52,871 --> 00:05:53,704
invest in the country.
And all of this was despite them being 

109
00:05:56,291 --> 00:05:59,510
one of the wealthiest countries when it 
comes to natural resources.

110
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,373
This is why since the very first moment,
Macri has tried to conduct a 180 degree 

111
00:06:05,061 --> 00:06:07,320
shift compared to what his predessessors
yeah.

112
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,243
Yeah.

113
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:12,520
Argentina's new government scraps,
mining taxes.

114
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,493
In other words,
Macri knows that lithium is a pls 

115
00:06:15,571 --> 00:06:17,850
opportunity to repair the accounting 
books.

116
00:06:17,950 --> 00:06:19,620
Of course not.
No one expects Argentine.

117
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:20,503
And to become a new Dubai over night 
that this white gold is a windfall and 

118
00:06:24,841 --> 00:06:28,710
that money could cover the gaps of 
Argentina's budget without raising taxes

119
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
and without cutting costs.
And as well,

120
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,640
this explains laws like this,

121
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:36,050
Margie,

122
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:36,883
Tina signs,
mining deal to unified regulations 

123
00:06:39,050 --> 00:06:39,920
attract investment.

124
00:06:40,030 --> 00:06:40,863
In other words from now on,
mining multinationals have an open door 

125
00:06:43,271 --> 00:06:44,104
to the country and unlike what happens 
with the coach and the era of these 

126
00:06:46,991 --> 00:06:49,810
foreign companies can do whatever they 
want with their profits.

127
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,763
This is happening because Macri has 
removed the anti repatriation law as if 

128
00:06:54,401 --> 00:06:55,234
this was not enough.
Legislation has been put into facts 

129
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:59,410
which unifies mining regulations all 
across the country.

130
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:03,790
This means that the rules are the same 
no matter where the lithium battery is.

131
00:07:03,791 --> 00:07:04,624
Further,
the mining companies will not have to 

132
00:07:05,501 --> 00:07:07,240
pay any special mining tax in.
Yeah,

133
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,860
industry heavyweights album Marlay court
saw Clinica,

134
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:16,590
he manera de Chile s a era met s a n 
junk.

135
00:07:16,610 --> 00:07:17,443
See Gum fun lithium company are among 
groups looking at expanding or building 

136
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,630
new lithium operations

137
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:23,483
in Argentina.

138
00:07:26,210 --> 00:07:28,640
Pause.
Hold on for just a second because well,

139
00:07:28,641 --> 00:07:31,700
things they are not quite as great as 
they seem.

140
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:36,110
Lithium is a great opportunity for 
Argentina bars.

141
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:36,973
As you know,
having natural resources does not mean 

142
00:07:38,931 --> 00:07:39,764
your country isn't necessarily wealthy.
Many entre into Indians fear what they 

143
00:07:42,741 --> 00:07:43,574
would call a new Potosi.
This means is that they fear that their 

144
00:07:45,861 --> 00:07:46,694
country would become flooded with 
foreign companies that take the 

145
00:07:48,951 --> 00:07:52,730
resources and leave without bringing any
money in to Argentina.

146
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:53,593
So the question now becomes what can 
Argentina do to avoid such a 

147
00:07:56,991 --> 00:07:57,824
catastrophe?

148
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,493
Yeah,

149
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:05,640
really

150
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,480
chance of origin.

151
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:07,483
Tina

152
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:10,103
said in a previous video,
the real business of lithium is not 

153
00:08:12,611 --> 00:08:13,444
lithium itself,
but to the added value products you can 

154
00:08:15,581 --> 00:08:16,410
manufacture.
Yeah.

155
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:21,410
With us at the time

156
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:22,903
when we recorded this video,
a metric ton of lithium had a market 

157
00:08:25,281 --> 00:08:29,510
price of $9,000 nevertheless,
if we take that raw material and then we

158
00:08:29,511 --> 00:08:30,344
turned it into mobile phone batteries,
we could get an income of between 1.5 

159
00:08:33,801 --> 00:08:36,080
and $5 million.
Of course,

160
00:08:36,081 --> 00:08:40,550
this is a very rough estimation,
but it does help us understand something

161
00:08:40,551 --> 00:08:41,384
important.
Hold on just a moment because this is 

162
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:46,620
still mode as simple as it looks,
works

163
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:50,040
muscle lithium battery factories are in 
countries like the United States,

164
00:08:50,041 --> 00:08:51,750
Germany,
or of course China.

165
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,613
These three countries have worldclass 
network of small companies provide 

166
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:58,150
services and components to the big 
manufacturing.

167
00:08:58,151 --> 00:08:58,280
Yeah,

168
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:00,500
well we're talking to

169
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:03,030
about logistics,
semiconductors and someone.

170
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,893
All of these things make the 
manufacturing process cheaper and more 

171
00:09:06,301 --> 00:09:07,620
efficient,
but not only that,

172
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:08,454
this network effect is what attracts the
best engineers in skilled professionals 

173
00:09:11,701 --> 00:09:13,470
to these countries.
This is a central,

174
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:16,060
if you want to create a high tech 
industry in it

175
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:16,963
country,

176
00:09:19,370 --> 00:09:20,203
like good luck trying to convince a 
woman who lives in San Francisco and 

177
00:09:22,661 --> 00:09:27,580
makes a six figure salary to move to 
Roserio Argentina to work in a factory.

178
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,850
As you can imagine,
that's pretty much impossible.

179
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,030
Now you might be wondering,
Wash,

180
00:09:35,031 --> 00:09:37,970
can matt green due to industrialize his 
country?

181
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:38,833
Well,
the first thing we have to keep in mind 

182
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:42,320
is that silicon valley,
it was not created in a day.

183
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:43,243
Nevertheless,
Argentina has a great advantage over 

184
00:09:45,081 --> 00:09:45,914
California.
They can make easy money by selling raw 

185
00:09:48,321 --> 00:09:49,154
lithium.
Of course there's money can be used by 

186
00:09:50,331 --> 00:09:52,220
the government to simply boost their 
earnings,

187
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,113
but it is also a good opportunity to 
invest in universities that will train 

188
00:09:55,701 --> 00:09:59,570
those workers that might start those 
small companies that are needed in order

189
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:01,030
to get the big factories up and yeah,

190
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:01,923
running

191
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,820
the government can also co-financed 
brand new businesses.

192
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:11,150
This is actually the formula that helps 
Israel become a technological capital as

193
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:12,033
well.
So far it seems that Macri is committed 

194
00:10:13,691 --> 00:10:14,650
to working this way.

195
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,793
We have learned,
we have understand that in addition to 

196
00:10:19,071 --> 00:10:23,420
our talents,
our huge natural resources,

197
00:10:23,421 --> 00:10:24,254
we have to add constancy.
We have to add rule of law to be 

198
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:29,654
predictable.

199
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,060
But

200
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:39,540
wait a minute because there are some 
dark clouds on the horizon.

201
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,403
All these opportunities,
Argentina has will disappear if my cree 

202
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,520
or whoever follows him falls back into 
the temptation of destroying the rule of

203
00:10:47,521 --> 00:10:48,354
law and going back to ultra nationalism,
which could scare away foreigners as it 

204
00:10:52,111 --> 00:10:53,550
has in many other countries.

205
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:57,770
And it seems that Cristina Fernandez de 
catch now wants to run for office again.

206
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,313
I am not asking you to vote for me.
[inaudible] I'm not asking you to vote 

207
00:11:03,751 --> 00:11:08,280
with the people behind me.
I am asking you to vote for yourself.

208
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:09,903
Okay.

209
00:11:10,540 --> 00:11:13,350
Say well now it's your turn.
Do you think Argentina could restore the

210
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:14,184
rule of Lauren's to come a wealthy 
country thanks to lithium or how are we 

211
00:11:16,681 --> 00:11:21,060
going to see a new nationalist backlash 
and there's a brand new economic crisis?

212
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,110
Well you can leave your answer in the 
comment section below and just before he

213
00:11:25,111 --> 00:11:27,360
goes to there you've got an important 
request from you.

214
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,313
You might have noticed that we rather 
like using rock music in our videos and 

215
00:11:31,141 --> 00:11:31,974
we'd love to hear from anyone who has a 
Benz and thinks that their music could 

216
00:11:34,081 --> 00:11:34,914
be a good fit for us.
We will of course give credit to any 

217
00:11:37,021 --> 00:11:39,870
music that we do use in a video.
If you are interested in this,

218
00:11:39,871 --> 00:11:41,430
do you drop us an email?
That's info,

219
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:42,264
