1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,840
In recent times,
the meetings between the U,

2
00:00:01,841 --> 00:00:05,540
s presidents and European leaders,
they've become quite tense.

3
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,803
Did I say summit,
which took place in early July of 2018 

4
00:00:15,270 --> 00:00:17,520
has been pretty good proof of that since
it's up.

5
00:00:17,521 --> 00:00:20,550
Some questions on the table is Donald 
trump writes,

6
00:00:20,551 --> 00:00:21,384
when criticizing his European partners,
all the European Nato countries taking 

7
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:28,800
advantage of the United States saw me 
and perhaps most importantly,

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:30,960
should Europe have an Ami.
Well,

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,853
this up,
if one thing has become very clear is 

10
00:00:42,481 --> 00:00:45,790
that Donald Trump isn't too fond of 
these European leader meetings.

11
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,050
I mean how bothersome it is to have to 
meet with all of these people.

12
00:00:50,051 --> 00:00:54,130
I a poor old trump.
If they were at least as fun as Vladimir

13
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:56,020
Putin or Kin Jong,
I mean finning.

14
00:00:56,021 --> 00:00:57,490
It'd be different.
Right?

15
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,920
It's an honor to be with you.

16
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:03,390
Thank you.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,433
Is that the clash between the US 
administration and most European 

18
00:01:09,091 --> 00:01:12,450
governments extends to virtually all 
issues economy,

19
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:14,490
trade,
immigration and defense.

20
00:01:14,570 --> 00:01:15,403
NATO members must finally contribute 
their fair share and meet their 

21
00:01:19,161 --> 00:01:19,994
financial obligations,
but 23 of the 28 member nations are 

22
00:01:23,841 --> 00:01:24,674
still not paying what they should be 
paying and what they're supposed to be 

23
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:28,820
paying for their defense.

24
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:30,103
See,
the US president has been criticizing 

25
00:01:31,511 --> 00:01:35,660
NATO for years due to the alleged lack 
of involvement of the European partners.

26
00:01:35,661 --> 00:01:36,494
Spin back to the US president has been 
saying things like that for almost 20 

27
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,474
years.

28
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,123
It has no vital interest in Europe.
There are conflicts are not worth 

29
00:01:46,861 --> 00:01:51,660
American lives.
Pulling back from Europe would save this

30
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:53,900
country millions of dollars annually.
Donald trump in 2000.

31
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,033
Of course,
it isn't just about the tenants of the 

32
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,880
White House.
The truth is that in recent decades,

33
00:01:58,881 --> 00:02:01,820
the differences between Europe and 
America have expanded,

34
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:02,683
for example,
of this baseball versus soccer and 

35
00:02:04,281 --> 00:02:07,400
appreciation for cars with gigantic 
engines.

36
00:02:07,401 --> 00:02:09,170
One can tell where the gas must be 
cheaper,

37
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,004
right?
It's also the way in which weapons are 

38
00:02:11,421 --> 00:02:14,510
considered in all fields.
Even in defense,

39
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,980
the army and the military are very,
very important issues in us politics,

40
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:22,670
but over in Europe,
not so much and it's even worse than not

41
00:02:22,671 --> 00:02:23,420
so much.
In fact,

42
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,253
these humps even frontpage issues and 
they're certainly not very popular 

43
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:31,430
prompts.
That's why since the Cold War ended,

44
00:02:31,431 --> 00:02:32,264
the military spending of European 
countries that belonged to NATO has 

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,680
collapsed in terms of GDP ranging from 
something a little over three percent to

46
00:02:39,681 --> 00:02:42,170
less than one point five in Europe.
Military spending,

47
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,033
it just doesn't sell,
and this view is is greatly angered 

48
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:48,740
Washington's politicians in recent years
and in this matter,

49
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,330
we're not only talking about Donald 
Trump,

50
00:02:50,331 --> 00:02:52,880
but also you,
Barack Obama and George W dot Bush,

51
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,263
their own visual politic.
In a previous video we told you why 

52
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,010
isn't such a good idea for European 
countries?

53
00:03:00,011 --> 00:03:03,910
Do you spend more money on weapons,
but hold on just a minute.

54
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,760
What if Washington was actually right?
Now listen up.

55
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,840
If Washington was right,
here's a question for you,

56
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:19,703
and as I always say,
please don't google it because that's 

57
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,913
cheating.
Do you know how many soldiers the 

58
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,660
European NATO countries have in total?
Well,

59
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,990
they'll tell you it's approximately one 
point 8 million soldiers.

60
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,853
However,
if this number only 30 percent can be 

61
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:37,590
deployed in the case of a conflict and 
only 50 to 100 thousands can be deployed

62
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:40,060
sustainably and for greater lengths of 
time,

63
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:44,570
and folks in general,
the European armies,

64
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,210
they've got many operational problems.
Yup,

65
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,220
it's true.
They do spend a lot of money,

66
00:03:49,221 --> 00:03:52,610
but their governments,
most of them don't really care very much

67
00:03:52,611 --> 00:03:53,900
about the results.
We can.

68
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,550
For example,
look at Germany,

69
00:03:55,551 --> 00:04:00,551
a country that in 2017 had a military 
budget of approximately $45,000,000,000.

70
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,233
That is,
it has one of the top 10 largest 

71
00:04:04,011 --> 00:04:09,011
military budgets of any country.
Well,

72
00:04:09,461 --> 00:04:10,294
despite being one of the countries with 
the largest military budget a couple of 

73
00:04:12,731 --> 00:04:15,300
years ago,
a study by the consultancy firm Mckinsey

74
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:16,143
for revealed that almost 60 percent of 
Germany's Eurofighter and Tornado 

75
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:21,580
fighter aircrafts and 80 percent of 
them,

76
00:04:21,581 --> 00:04:22,414
most modern helicopters were not ready 
for combat due to a lack of maintenance 

77
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:28,090
updates and supplies.

78
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,433
At the end of 2017,
a parliamentary investigation showed 

79
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:33,673
quite a similar results,
not one of the submarines and none of 

80
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:40,820
the 14 main transport planes of the 
German air force or even operational,

81
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:46,040
not a single one,
and we're not even exaggerating.

82
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:46,963
Even a document from the German Ministry
of Defense warns that the soldiers 

83
00:04:49,341 --> 00:04:50,174
didn't have enough protective vests when
to clothes or tents to participate in 

84
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:56,890
any important NATO mission,
and believe me,

85
00:04:56,891 --> 00:05:01,120
it's not just Germany.
For example,

86
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:01,954
during the war in Libya,
despite being a relatively small 

87
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,164
conflicts,
just three weeks after the attacks 

88
00:05:06,851 --> 00:05:09,280
began,
the European air forces began to run out

89
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:14,340
of precision weapons and other words.
Governments spend large amounts of money

90
00:05:15,831 --> 00:05:18,710
on weapons programs and they've had many
soldiers,

91
00:05:18,711 --> 00:05:22,880
but that doesn't really matter when it 
comes to the day to day operations.

92
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:26,330
And that's how we ended up with news 
like this.

93
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,840
The Legion declares all out war on 
obesity.

94
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,733
The elite unit of the Spanish infantry 
launches a plan to combat obesity among 

95
00:05:35,610 --> 00:05:36,450
its members.

96
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:40,170
Honestly,
because that's not the worst of it.

97
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,310
Perhaps what annoys the US offices,
the most of the rules with which some of

98
00:05:44,311 --> 00:05:47,280
the European armies have entered combat 
under NATO.

99
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:49,380
For example,
in Afghanistan.

100
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,680
See many European governments don't want
to assume any kinds of risks,

101
00:05:52,681 --> 00:05:53,514
so they ordered them military commanders
to maintain this soldiers away from the 

102
00:05:56,431 --> 00:05:58,310
front.
In the case of the Afghan campaign,

103
00:05:58,311 --> 00:06:01,100
for example,
US soldiers sharing testimonies in which

104
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:01,934
they were denied medical evacuation by 
Europeans because they were in a combat 

105
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,020
zone,
wasn't strange.

106
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:06,980
Listen to this.

107
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:11,440
Ghana's Stan year 2008.
We were returning from a mission.

108
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:13,930
When a rocket hit the vehicle that was 
in front of mine,

109
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:17,740
our Humvee was suddenly being attacked 
by machine gunfire.

110
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:18,693
Of the 11 vehicles that entered the 
ambush area for left inoperative and a 

111
00:06:21,911 --> 00:06:25,630
fifth one was destroyed over.
Boys had died and it doesn't.

112
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,493
We're wounded.
We were six hours away by car from our 

113
00:06:28,421 --> 00:06:30,430
base.
It was getting dark and the Taliban were

114
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:31,264
still attacking us.
When we call to ask for a medical 

115
00:06:33,041 --> 00:06:35,680
evacuation,
they asked us if the landing area was so

116
00:06:35,681 --> 00:06:36,910
hot.
We said yes,

117
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:37,773
we were being attacked.
That moment of voice with a foreign 

118
00:06:39,461 --> 00:06:40,294
accent told me that their rules 
prevented them from providing us 

119
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:43,264
assistance.
He asked me if we could secure the 

120
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,424
landing area or if we can move minutes 
turned into hours and the Taliban 

121
00:06:48,461 --> 00:06:49,294
continued attacking us.
Then out of nowhere a voice came up on 

122
00:06:52,211 --> 00:06:53,650
the radio.
It was American.

123
00:06:53,770 --> 00:06:54,603
A couple of Black Hawk helicopters from 
a totally different mission had heard 

124
00:06:57,641 --> 00:07:00,760
our help call.
The pilots deviated immediately.

125
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:04,000
Within 15 minutes they landed in her 
wounded were evacuated.

126
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,983
Our superiors told us that the NATO 
country who is responsible for medical 

127
00:07:07,601 --> 00:07:10,930
evacuations had a rule that prevented 
them from intervening,

128
00:07:10,931 --> 00:07:14,170
instill hot areas.
We were furious.

129
00:07:14,260 --> 00:07:15,093
Elliot Ackerman,
a veteran who served in the Afghanistan 

130
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:18,760
Marine special operations core.

131
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:21,843
Just a second,
because this is really important in 

132
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,023
Afghanistan alone,
nearly 900 European soldiers who have 

133
00:07:27,341 --> 00:07:28,174
lost their lives.
We're talking about political orders 

134
00:07:29,891 --> 00:07:32,980
that don't happen in all cases,
but which are very common.

135
00:07:33,070 --> 00:07:35,890
I know it's not a matter of money.
It's a matter of commitment.

136
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:39,040
Every year the European NATO countries 
spend almost $300,

137
00:07:39,041 --> 00:07:39,874
billion dollars that is together.
They have the second largest military 

138
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:48,620
budget after the United States.

139
00:07:48,770 --> 00:07:50,620
It's

140
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:56,963
flight of this in Washington.
They want European NATO countries do 

141
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:00,263
substantially increase the military 
spending and that's where the magical 

142
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:05,400
two percent of the GDP figures up here.

143
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:06,700
Yes,

144
00:08:14,550 --> 00:08:15,383
the two percent milk

145
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,060
as he made very clear at the last NATO 
summit,

146
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:20,923
Donald trump is furious.
According to the vast majority of the 

147
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:26,960
countries of the Atlantic alliance,
they're late in their quota payments.

148
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,823
Check this out.

149
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:29,833
Many countries in NATO which we are 
expected to defend or not only short of 

150
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:36,290
their current commitment of two percent,
which is low,

151
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:39,980
but are also delinquent for many years 
and payments that have not been made,

152
00:08:40,160 --> 00:08:41,900
will they reimburse the US?

153
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:44,590
Well,
one of two is true.

154
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:45,453
Either he's saying this because he has 
no idea or are you saying it because he 

155
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:50,800
wants some electoral points.
Spa,

156
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:53,590
of course fooling the Veritas because 
let's be clear,

157
00:08:53,591 --> 00:08:57,660
this entire payments thing has no point 
of reference.

158
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:00,383
Two percent is a military spending 
objective from each country for its own 

159
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,900
army that has nothing to do with NATO 
payments or anything like that.

160
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:10,710
That is if a country spends less,
it doesn't own anything to NATO,

161
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:13,290
the United States or anyone else for 
that matter.

162
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:18,450
The fact is that in 2014,
after a lot of pressure,

163
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,313
Barack Obama managed to get the European
NATO countries to commit to 

164
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,460
substantially increasing the military 
budget to reach two percent of their GDP

165
00:09:26,461 --> 00:09:29,400
by 20,
24 and precisely due to that commitment.

166
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:30,293
Europe is the region of the world where 
military spending is increasing the 

167
00:09:32,971 --> 00:09:33,990
most.
Check this out.

168
00:09:34,020 --> 00:09:34,853
Awesome.

169
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,270
Yes.
You know that later,

170
00:09:40,271 --> 00:09:41,104
trump and especially his supporters will
say that this was all thanks to him to 

171
00:09:44,471 --> 00:09:47,650
his magnificent negotiating skills.
However,

172
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:48,513
even if military spending increases,
it probably won't actually change 

173
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,174
anything first.
This two percent figure it's a random 

174
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:58,270
number which could be reached simply by 
raising military salaries or cheating in

175
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:01,860
all kinds of other ways.
Greece,

176
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:02,733
for example,
is one of the few countries that 

177
00:10:03,701 --> 00:10:05,740
complies with this and it spends two 
point three,

178
00:10:05,741 --> 00:10:06,574
six percent of its GDP,
but a large part of that budget is used 

179
00:10:09,011 --> 00:10:09,844
to pay the military pensions and even 
most of their investments in military 

180
00:10:12,581 --> 00:10:15,160
equipment is geared towards defense 
against hockey,

181
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:20,190
which is another NATO member country as 
a result of this.

182
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,273
Well,
even though the expenditure rule is 

183
00:10:22,211 --> 00:10:23,044
apparently being followed to the Greek 
army brings little or nothing to the 

184
00:10:26,141 --> 00:10:26,974
organization's capabilities,
but even though all of this money could 

185
00:10:29,651 --> 00:10:32,970
be used to really improve the armies and
of course without political commitments,

186
00:10:32,971 --> 00:10:35,980
it will never happen.
Not much will be achieved anyway.

187
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:38,883
European countries will continue to 
depend on the United States for forced 

188
00:10:41,951 --> 00:10:42,784
deployments because each country on its 
own wouldn't be able to afford to 

189
00:10:44,741 --> 00:10:47,200
maintain that kind of global 
deployments.

190
00:10:47,230 --> 00:10:50,980
Intelligence and supply capabilities and
of course given that in Europe,

191
00:10:50,981 --> 00:10:51,814
military operations on popular,
neither the political commitments and 

192
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:57,220
all the rules friends are in combat will
actually change.

193
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:00,730
That is we would have larger armies,
but at the moments of truth,

194
00:11:00,790 --> 00:11:03,400
very similar deficiencies.
But also,

195
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,293
let's consider something else.
The armed forces can perform for 

196
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:08,950
essential functions,
deterrents,

197
00:11:09,010 --> 00:11:13,360
intervention in deployments,
occupation and cybersecurity for none of

198
00:11:13,361 --> 00:11:17,050
these tasks as the current European 
countries budgets a hindrance,

199
00:11:23,410 --> 00:11:24,860
two point terrorism,
more quickly,

200
00:11:24,861 --> 00:11:27,650
deploy somewhere in the world and face a
special situation.

201
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:30,440
You don't really need multiple aircraft 
carriers.

202
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:31,303
That is redundant forces.
It's much more important to be able to 

203
00:11:33,621 --> 00:11:36,020
deploy quickly and manage a conflict.

204
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:39,833
For example,
there's the latest United States and 

205
00:11:41,431 --> 00:11:43,890
NATO wars in Afghanistan,
Iraq and Libya.

206
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:46,500
In all of them.
The military victory was simple,

207
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,950
but the postwar period,
it was an absolute disaster.

208
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:52,103
Preparing forces to manage local and 
using the country's different 

209
00:11:54,671 --> 00:11:56,980
institutions to train the national 
forces.

210
00:11:56,981 --> 00:11:59,920
Not only the military but also from the 
police trial courts,

211
00:11:59,921 --> 00:12:00,880
prisons,
power plants,

212
00:12:00,890 --> 00:12:01,723
etc.
Would probably have been a great deal 

213
00:12:04,061 --> 00:12:04,894
more useful at the end of the day.
VieW at facing of conflict requires a 

214
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:11,440
lot of things and not always the same 
ones.

215
00:12:11,470 --> 00:12:15,460
The threats we face today don't require 
re craft carriers or fighter bombers.

216
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:18,730
They require agility.
Europe doesn't need to spend more.

217
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,160
It spends a lot.
It just needs to spend better,

218
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,083
and that's where the idea of the 
european army in that pascoe a european 

219
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:36,950
army,
in december of 2017,

220
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:39,220
the european union launched the pascoe 
program,

221
00:12:39,221 --> 00:12:42,040
need permanent structured cooperation.
It's objective.

222
00:12:42,070 --> 00:12:42,903
While that would be coordinating the 
countries that participate in the 

223
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,530
program in terms of security,
acquisition of war materials,

224
00:12:47,531 --> 00:12:50,110
and joint defense in peace operations.
In other words,

225
00:12:50,111 --> 00:12:53,170
to begin integrating the various armed 
forces.

226
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,063
The program is still in a very incipient
phase and isn't considered the 

227
00:12:56,621 --> 00:12:59,200
equivalent of a european army yet,
however,

228
00:12:59,201 --> 00:13:02,110
this could be the best solution to all 
their problems.

229
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,113
The 25 countries that make up the 
program by integrating that armies that 

230
00:13:08,631 --> 00:13:12,670
weapons purchases their training and 
even by sharing resources could mean for

231
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:13,543
europe even while spending the last 
would have a modern well equipped army 

232
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:18,560
with great deployment capabilities.

233
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:24,070
After all,
if a country like Spain spends a fortune

234
00:13:24,071 --> 00:13:24,904
buying leopard tanks,
which happens and in practice due to a 

235
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:28,623
lack of means to deploy them,
they only uses them to defend against 

236
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:31,593
Portugal.
They've made a totally unnecessary 

237
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,960
expense.
Wouldn't you agree,

238
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:38,320
folks today?
The risks and challenges,

239
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:41,110
they're global,
so I sincerely belieVe that europe needs

240
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,450
more integration to do you think is data
and seek to complete to the us.

241
00:13:44,470 --> 00:13:46,900
Military has contributions within the 
nato framework,

242
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:51,520
but it's not achieved by spending more 
also almost $300,000,000,000

243
00:13:51,521 --> 00:13:53,080
a year.
It should be more than enough,

244
00:13:54,970 --> 00:13:55,803
but now it's your sound.
Do you think europe should develop its 

245
00:13:58,301 --> 00:13:59,170
own army?
Well,

246
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,013
