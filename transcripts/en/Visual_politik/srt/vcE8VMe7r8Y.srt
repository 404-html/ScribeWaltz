1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:08,720
It's a challenge for you.
I'll show you.

3
00:00:08,721 --> 00:00:11,930
Finish watching this video goes your 
kitchen and open the fridge.

4
00:00:11,960 --> 00:00:15,800
Then try to find something that has been
produced outside of your country.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,410
If you're watching this video from a 
European country,

6
00:00:18,411 --> 00:00:22,400
tried to find some product produced 
outside of the European Union,

7
00:00:22,580 --> 00:00:27,580
I bet she probably can't even find it.
Maybe this doesn't surprise you.

8
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:31,303
Well,
if you think about it a little more 

9
00:00:32,031 --> 00:00:32,864
considered that your mobile phone has 
been manufactured in more than 20 

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:38,450
different countries.
The trousers you're wearing right now,

11
00:00:38,451 --> 00:00:42,080
we're probably manufactured in a country
like China or Bangladesh,

12
00:00:42,081 --> 00:00:45,170
and maybe the company you work for is 
also foreign.

13
00:00:45,260 --> 00:00:46,940
I mean,
there's no surprises there,

14
00:00:46,941 --> 00:00:47,570
right?
I mean,

15
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:50,420
we will live in a globalized economy.
Nonetheless.

16
00:00:50,450 --> 00:00:52,520
Food is the exception to the rule.

17
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:54,303
Really,

18
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:57,893
agriculture is an industry that is 
completely protected from foreign 

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,973
competition and make no mistake here.
This has nothing to do with Donald 

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,240
Trump.
In fact,

21
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,370
if you think he's the creator of trade 
was,

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,070
well,
your actually absolutely wrong.

23
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:11,933
Actually,
the primary sector exists in a never 

24
00:01:14,271 --> 00:01:15,104
ending cold war.
That's why from time to time we see 

25
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,410
headlines like this one

26
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:26,870
war rips through farm world,
soybean hog prices fall,

27
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,790
or maybe this one cuts import tariffs in
a bid to end.

28
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:35,360
Banana wars are morven tariffs out.
In fact,

29
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,253
tariffs aren't just one of the many 
tools you use to attack foreign markets 

30
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:40,970
bands.
They're not even the deadliest.

31
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,833
Here's an example.
American spends more than $20 billion a 

32
00:01:44,511 --> 00:01:47,630
year in subsidies that are farmers 
sounded like a lot to you.

33
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:51,290
Well,
not compared to the whopping $72 billion

34
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,290
that the EU spends in subsidies every 
single year.

35
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:56,180
And how you might be wondering,
well,

36
00:01:56,181 --> 00:01:58,790
what do the subsidies have to do with 
trade was,

37
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:04,000
and the answer that as well.
A lot example,

38
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,913
this milk rake you see on the screen 
here is worth an average of 60 euro 

39
00:02:09,491 --> 00:02:12,820
cents and a Spanish supermarket from 
those 60 cents.

40
00:02:12,821 --> 00:02:13,654
The Spanish Pharma would get 30 cents,
but it's actual revenue is going to be 

41
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,450
44 cents.
And why is this?

42
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,343
Well,
that's because the European Union will 

43
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:24,460
give them a subsidy of 14 cents per 
liter,

44
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:28,833
thanks to this grand.
So the farmer can sell cheap and still 

45
00:02:30,521 --> 00:02:31,354
make money.
And this is why Europe doesn't need to 

46
00:02:33,071 --> 00:02:37,600
buy African sugar despite it being 
cheaper or even more surprisingly,

47
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:38,434
why American or European producers can 
snatch the competition from African 

48
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:44,440
markets despite there having higher 
wages.

49
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:48,460
But hold on a minute here because things
are about to change.

50
00:02:48,461 --> 00:02:51,790
And this time the free market champion 
is not America.

51
00:02:51,791 --> 00:02:54,910
It's not Japan or even Australia dare 
viewer,

52
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:55,863
despite what you might expect if there 
is somebody willing to start an 

53
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,870
agricultural.
It's actually the European.

54
00:03:01,871 --> 00:03:01,990
Yeah,

55
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:02,823
union.

56
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:09,850
Well macron breaks French taboo on farm 
subsidies.

57
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,773
A French president questioning these 
subsidies on farming is like a hipster 

58
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:15,063
closing his instagram accounts.
It's something that's never been done 

59
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:18,784
before for years.
The so called Common Agricultural 

60
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,113
Policy,
also known as the CAAP has been one of 

61
00:03:23,951 --> 00:03:28,930
the pillars of the European Union and 
France is by far its biggest supporter.

62
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:32,200
But like I said,
things that are about to change.

63
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,123
So now the question becomes is you're 
really ready to liberalize its 

64
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:38,100
agricultural sex up.
Oh,

65
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:41,950
we about to see the ends of the food 
trade wars.

66
00:03:41,951 --> 00:03:46,120
And most importantly of all here is this
good or bad news swell.

67
00:03:46,121 --> 00:03:48,870
In this video we are going the answer 
all of these questions,

68
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:51,720
but before we do,
let's take a look back.

69
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,033
The history

70
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,083
he used for,
let's imagine that we have a wheat farm 

71
00:04:01,010 --> 00:04:04,590
in Essex in the UK.
We harvest the crop and go to sell it to

72
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:04,910
the month.

73
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:05,743
Yes,

74
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:13,990
boss time we did,
we received 175 pounds per ton.

75
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:18,280
So it makes sense to expect to sell it 
for a similar price this time around,

76
00:04:18,281 --> 00:04:20,500
right?
Well actually no,

77
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:21,334
I mean maybe this time the market price 
for wheat is actually just 150 pounds 

78
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,224
per ton.
This is a reality that every farmer 

79
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,280
faces every year.
By contrast,

80
00:04:30,281 --> 00:04:33,460
the price of an iphone,
it doesn't really change much over time.

81
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,294
So if we sell I phones,
we can make good predictions about our 

82
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,134
income,
but wheat,

83
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:38,973
corn oil,
or any other commodity can change their 

84
00:04:41,171 --> 00:04:46,171
market price from one day to the next.
And I,

85
00:04:47,351 --> 00:04:48,490
you might be wondering,
well,

86
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:50,170
why?
Why does this happen?

87
00:04:50,171 --> 00:04:52,930
What is the difference between wheat and
it's an iphone?

88
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:56,530
While the differences that commodities 
at the same everywhere.

89
00:04:56,620 --> 00:05:00,280
Maybe you eat some bread today.
Could you tell me where the weeks it was

90
00:05:00,281 --> 00:05:01,810
made from?
What's produced?

91
00:05:01,811 --> 00:05:03,460
Well,
probably not.

92
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:04,353
The same goes with the oil used to 
produce the gasoline that you put in 

93
00:05:07,061 --> 00:05:10,270
your car.
You don't know if it's Saudi or Canadian

94
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,253
and you don't really care.
You just want it to be as absolutely 

95
00:05:14,411 --> 00:05:19,411
cheap as possible.
Nonetheless,

96
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:22,490
there I'll just a few dinosaur juice 
producers.

97
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,920
Meanwhile,
there are many producers of wheat,

98
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:26,420
corn,
and potatoes,

99
00:05:26,570 --> 00:05:29,240
so if one big producer had a good 
harvest,

100
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,630
that's going to affect that market price
for everybody.

101
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,070
And then of course you've got to add to 
this,

102
00:05:34,071 --> 00:05:35,470
the weather,
too little rain,

103
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:40,070
too much rain or an unusually cold.
Windsor can be enough to kill off all of

104
00:05:40,071 --> 00:05:41,330
your revenue.
Nonetheless,

105
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:46,360
we need agriculture because 
unfortunately you cannot eat oil or only

106
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:47,323
phones.

107
00:05:50,610 --> 00:05:53,940
So how can we keep eating while farmers 
don't staff?

108
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:56,130
Now this might sound like a stupid 
question,

109
00:05:56,131 --> 00:05:56,964
but belief knee,
it's one of the hardest problems in 

110
00:05:59,241 --> 00:06:00,074
economics as well.
This is where that common agricultural 

111
00:06:02,451 --> 00:06:04,790
policy that we mentioned comes into 
play.

112
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:07,850
This is how the European Union protects 
the farmers.

113
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:13,613
When we talk about the CAAP,
we're talking about the cornerstone of 

114
00:06:16,261 --> 00:06:17,094
the European Union.
It was the thing even before the 

115
00:06:18,781 --> 00:06:21,540
Schengen area or the eurozone were even 
born.

116
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:22,703
Ashley,
do you know who the father of the CIP 

117
00:06:24,271 --> 00:06:25,110
was?
Well,

118
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,970
yeah.
It was that French president,

119
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:27,620
Charles de [inaudible]

120
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:28,453
gold

121
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:36,310
nation has no friends,
only interests.

122
00:06:36,790 --> 00:06:38,170
Charles did God.
Now,

123
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,780
if you've been subscribed to visual 
politic for a while,

124
00:06:40,781 --> 00:06:41,614
you already know that Charles,
the goal was not exactly a big fan of 

125
00:06:44,591 --> 00:06:45,790
the free markets.
Well,

126
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:48,670
actually he wasn't really a big fan of 
anyone except himself.

127
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,470
Really.
This is why we're in France,

128
00:06:50,471 --> 00:06:52,660
became a member of the European single 
market.

129
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,760
What would later become the European 
Union.

130
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:57,250
He added a condition.
He basically said,

131
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,960
all right,
we're going to sign up,

132
00:06:58,961 --> 00:06:59,794
but you got to promise us that nobody's 
going to become our competition for 

133
00:07:02,411 --> 00:07:03,190
farmers.
All right,

134
00:07:03,190 --> 00:07:04,023
and basically that salvage the Apu was 
born a policy that is so intervention 

135
00:07:07,810 --> 00:07:10,270
list.
It makes Bernie Sanders look blank.

136
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:11,350
Warren Buffett

137
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:15,380
basically

138
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:19,400
in order to compensate for potential 
losses when market prices go down,

139
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:22,280
the European Union gives them direct 
cash.

140
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:25,340
For example,
if you have a bond with cows in Spain,

141
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,174
Brussels will still give you cash 
straight away for each and every calvet 

142
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,970
you own.
And if you want to buy a milking machine

143
00:07:31,971 --> 00:07:33,530
that is going to make you more 
presumptive,

144
00:07:33,650 --> 00:07:35,630
well Brussels is going to help you with 
that.

145
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:36,470
Sue,
this way,

146
00:07:36,471 --> 00:07:38,360
Europe is not only guaranteeing your 
income,

147
00:07:38,361 --> 00:07:43,070
but it's also helping it to protect you 
from American or African producers.

148
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:47,870
And as you might have already imagined,
all of this aid costs say it's a load of

149
00:07:47,871 --> 00:07:48,704
money.
So if you want to get a better idea 

150
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:53,783
during the 1990s the caap comprised 80% 
of the whole European budgets and even 

151
00:07:59,331 --> 00:08:02,150
now when Europe is bigger and it's got 
more stuff to do,

152
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,103
the CAAP,
it still makes up 40% of all you 

153
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:10,040
spending and surprise surprise there I 
guess which comes from,

154
00:08:10,041 --> 00:08:13,220
he receives most of the aids.
Of course it's France,

155
00:08:13,250 --> 00:08:14,083
but hold on just a moment because things
they do not stop right here beyond his 

156
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:18,533
direct aid.
Europe also has other tactics to avoid 

157
00:08:20,871 --> 00:08:24,230
price fluctuations as well as quotas and
tariffs.

158
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:32,010
For example,
in order to avoid a price drop in milk,

159
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,980
Europe used to put a production limits 
on each country.

160
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:39,360
That means that you couldn't produce 
more than a certain number of liters and

161
00:08:39,361 --> 00:08:43,050
it's of course he was benefiting the 
most from these production quotas.

162
00:08:43,230 --> 00:08:44,063
Well,
of course it was the country of 

163
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:48,480
croissant and the guests.
As you can imagine,

164
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:49,314
this milk quota,
it created all kinds of problems among 

165
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,140
the other members.
And this is why despite French pressure,

166
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,660
Europe had to put an end to all of this

167
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:06,400
end of European milk quotas,
a new era for the French dairy sector.

168
00:09:06,460 --> 00:09:09,220
And of course we also have the tariffs 
tariffs.

169
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:14,020
They're like sniper bullets designed to 
stop very specific products from getting

170
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,150
into European markets.
For example,

171
00:09:16,151 --> 00:09:19,570
imagine that you are an Argentinian 
coffee producer.

172
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:20,643
If you want to sell your law coffee,
meaning you take it from the plant and 

173
00:09:24,011 --> 00:09:26,290
the sellers Europe,
they got no problem.

174
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:29,500
Zero tariffs for you.
And why is that?

175
00:09:29,501 --> 00:09:30,334
Well,
it's because no European country grows 

176
00:09:32,141 --> 00:09:32,974
coffee,
but if you want to sell this coffee and 

177
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:39,310
it's already toasted and processed form,
well good luck to you.

178
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,950
You're going to have to pay a tariff of 
7.5%

179
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,270
and why is that?
Well,

180
00:09:43,271 --> 00:09:44,104
because Europe has factories that 
process and toast coffee and they just 

181
00:09:48,041 --> 00:09:53,041
don't really like competition boss.
I knew what you're thinking right now.

182
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,520
Oh,
that evil European Union,

183
00:09:57,521 --> 00:09:59,200
that punishment,
the third wells,

184
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,130
those Brussels bureaucrats,
they just want to destroy free trade.

185
00:10:03,530 --> 00:10:04,363
Well,
I've actually got bad news for you 

186
00:10:05,021 --> 00:10:05,854
because the reality is that every 
country on the planet does the exact 

187
00:10:09,131 --> 00:10:10,270
same thing.
In fact,

188
00:10:10,271 --> 00:10:11,104
when it comes to tariffs,
Europe is actually one of the most open 

189
00:10:13,781 --> 00:10:14,614
regions.

190
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,393
For example,
if the same farmer wants to sell his 

191
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:21,764
coffee in Japan,
he's going to have to pay a 20% tariff 

192
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:26,293
if he wants to sell bananas.
Then he asked to pay between 40 and 50% 

193
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:33,560
depending on the season as what about 
America is a land of the free?

194
00:10:33,710 --> 00:10:35,990
Well,
it's actually kind of the same.

195
00:10:35,991 --> 00:10:36,824
There.
Almost no country is willing to leave 

196
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:45,780
its farmers alone in order to compete 
with fat competition.

197
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:50,160
Nonetheless,
all of this can change and why?

198
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:51,360
Well,
let's have a look at that.

199
00:10:56,550 --> 00:10:57,383
At times for protectionism,
every year Europe spends over $72 

200
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:03,550
billion subsidizing its own farmers.
There's,

201
00:11:03,610 --> 00:11:05,860
as you can imagine,
not all the country.

202
00:11:05,861 --> 00:11:10,240
Then there's paid the same amount.
Just have a look at this chart here.

203
00:11:10,270 --> 00:11:14,560
You can see the main contributors.
That is the countries that pay more than

204
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:19,260
what they get.
Surprise,

205
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:22,000
surprise here.
Who is the third biggest caap nets?

206
00:11:22,001 --> 00:11:23,130
Congenita.
Well,

207
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:24,990
of course that's the United Kingdom.

208
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,083
[inaudible]

209
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,680
Shane's at will no longer be a member of
the club.

210
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,693
As you can imagine,
this leaves a whole of more than a 12 

211
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,353
billion euros.
This is why many are suggesting that 

212
00:11:37,160 --> 00:11:37,993
other countries have to start paying 
more to keep the spending where it used 

213
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:41,414
to be.

214
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,073
Yeah.

215
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:50,290
Pin Commission urges you countries to 
pay more into budget nonetheless,

216
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:51,183
who really wants to pay more.
It's a time when you're a skeptic are 

217
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:54,454
stronger than ever and no politician can
really come back to his own country and 

218
00:11:57,401 --> 00:11:58,091
say,
hey,

219
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,620
guess what guys?
Without your wallet,

220
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,720
because we got to pay more for being in 
the EU.

221
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,290
It's not going to go down well.
So if you do the math,

222
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:08,600
you realize that there's only really one
option.

223
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:11,700
Yeah.
Musters plans.

224
00:12:11,970 --> 00:12:12,803
It's payments to Europe's biggest farms,
basically Europe hat to reduce the 

225
00:12:16,381 --> 00:12:17,214
direct aid given to the farmers.
And they've started with the wealthiest 

226
00:12:20,671 --> 00:12:23,250
ones since they're the ones who needed 
them the least.

227
00:12:23,370 --> 00:12:27,480
But the biggest surprise came with 
Emmanuel macron speech.

228
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,373
Everybody in Brussels might expect from 
stupid come out as the biggest old 

229
00:12:31,461 --> 00:12:33,180
school crp supporter.
Right?

230
00:12:33,330 --> 00:12:34,790
Let's mcallen.
Well,

231
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,000
he's got other priorities and this means
a green light to cut aid in the future.

232
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,750
Meanwhile,
trade deals being struck in fashion.

233
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:45,993
Ooh.
And Mexico agreed to new free trade 

234
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:49,150
pact.
Yes.

235
00:12:49,151 --> 00:12:49,984
Yes.
He has someone not only talking about 

236
00:12:50,861 --> 00:12:52,820
Mexico here,
I mean look at this new,

237
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:53,863
yes,

238
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:57,423
pn union rush to promote.
It's preliminary free trade agreement 

239
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:03,070
with Japan by stressing the benefits for
you farmers.

240
00:13:03,130 --> 00:13:04,750
Yes,
stiff us slowly.

241
00:13:04,751 --> 00:13:07,180
The European Union is reducing 
subsidies,

242
00:13:07,181 --> 00:13:11,770
reducing tariffs and getting rid of 
production quotas and I know what you're

243
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:13,060
probably thinking right now.
You're thinking,

244
00:13:13,061 --> 00:13:13,871
come on Simon.
A,

245
00:13:13,871 --> 00:13:17,470
you're rarely telling us that brexit is 
the only reason for this change.

246
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:18,531
Well,
no,

247
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,780
I'm Saturday.
In fact,

248
00:13:19,790 --> 00:13:20,623
there are two other important reasons.
On the one hand is European agriculture 

249
00:13:23,751 --> 00:13:25,800
is already more productive than 
elsewhere.

250
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,103
This video we told you about the 
Netherlands being one of the biggest 

251
00:13:29,751 --> 00:13:31,610
agricultural powerhouses.
In fact,

252
00:13:31,611 --> 00:13:34,340
they have what we call the food silicon 
valley.

253
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:37,680
Okay?

254
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:38,513
In fact is of bad.
She is or Ribera del Duero wine can be 

255
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:44,150
found almost everywhere and they all 
come from Europe.

256
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:45,180
In other words,
you're a,

257
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,260
doesn't need to protect its own markets 
anymore,

258
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:48,103
but instead sign lots of trade deals and
I know what you might be thinking right 

259
00:13:52,401 --> 00:13:53,234
now.
We'll farmers be happy when they stop 

260
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:57,920
getting all of these subsidies from 
Brussels.

261
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,770
Well,
the reality is no,

262
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,740
but the question really is,
does actually matter.

263
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:05,120
Look,
peasants unions,

264
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:05,954
they used to have a big political grip 
during the 60s when the goal was the 

265
00:14:09,441 --> 00:14:12,320
French president.
France had millions of people working in

266
00:14:12,321 --> 00:14:14,440
the primary sector.
Now their ons,

267
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:15,283
even 3% of the population working there.
This means way less political sway and 

268
00:14:19,401 --> 00:14:21,140
weighed us votes.
But not only that,

269
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:23,780
who do you think these European farmers 
vote for?

270
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,280
Francis disillusioned farmers turn to Le
Pen.

271
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,233
Exactly.
Basically the biggest place for 

272
00:14:32,621 --> 00:14:37,420
euroskeptic parties to get their votes 
are rural areas where farmers live.

273
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,540
So if you're a European politician and 
he wants to make your vote as happy,

274
00:14:40,550 --> 00:14:41,383
you're really kind of do want to pay 
more attention to the urban europeanist 

275
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:49,320
voters instead of the rural euro skeptic
ones and come on now because the average

276
00:14:49,331 --> 00:14:52,350
city guy,
they don't know what the caap even.

277
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:52,490
Yeah.

278
00:14:52,490 --> 00:14:53,323
Is,

279
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:58,910
and this leads us to our question for 
you.

280
00:14:58,911 --> 00:15:02,600
Does the CAAP have any future whatsoever
in Europe?

281
00:15:02,601 --> 00:15:03,434
Will we see greater liberalization of 
agriculture in Europe as well as the 

282
00:15:06,321 --> 00:15:07,520
rest of the world?
