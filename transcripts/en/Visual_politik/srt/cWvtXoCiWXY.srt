1
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,840
Today there are about 25 countries 
without an army,

2
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,210
but I'll ask you which one of them was 
fast?

3
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:18,560
Which country do you think was the first
he voluntarily give up its armed forces.

4
00:00:18,620 --> 00:00:22,040
If you guys do European country,
you're not even on the right continence.

5
00:00:22,041 --> 00:00:22,874
It was actually a Latin American country
and that was of course Costa Rica on 

6
00:00:34,771 --> 00:00:37,790
December the first 19,
48 after a civil war under president and

7
00:00:37,791 --> 00:00:39,720
Jose Figueroa.
As Fair as administration,

8
00:00:39,721 --> 00:00:43,170
Costa Rica puts an end to its military 
career and you know what?

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,123
This wasn't actually a bad mood.
Send the country hasn't had a single 

10
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:52,770
wall or a single key.
In fact,

11
00:00:52,771 --> 00:00:56,340
Costa Rica can boast about being the 
country with the longest,

12
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,860
uninterrupted period of democratic 
governments in Latin America because Dvo

13
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,833
north again,
to the enormous way that the military 

14
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:06,090
boot has traditionally had on last and 
American.

15
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:06,933
Okay.

16
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,113
Then there's the fact that Costa Rica is
located in one of the most violent 

17
00:01:10,551 --> 00:01:12,710
regions in the world.
Central America.

18
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,543
Okay.

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:18,623
Despite this,
this tropical country located between 

20
00:01:20,371 --> 00:01:21,204
the Caribbean sea and the Pacific Ocean 
has managed to become a middle income 

21
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:27,030
country with quite high levels of 
prosperity.

22
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,530
So what's the recipe here?
Well,

23
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:30,510
prosperity,
peace and safety.

24
00:01:30,511 --> 00:01:31,344
These are the ingredients that have made
Costa Rica habitually known as the 

25
00:01:34,981 --> 00:01:37,200
Switzerland of Latin in America.
Now,

26
00:01:37,201 --> 00:01:38,034
what is true in all of this,
and in this video we want to tell you a 

27
00:01:40,501 --> 00:01:43,170
bit more about Costa Rica.
We want to have a look good.

28
00:01:43,171 --> 00:01:45,390
It's light,
but also at its shadows.

29
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:46,530
So let's dive in.

30
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:52,120
Just a happy face,

31
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:58,180
however we look at it.
Costa Rica is a very special country.

32
00:01:58,210 --> 00:01:59,043
Divya,
we're talking about a country whose 

33
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:04,240
hallmark color is green because of Costa
Rica is associated with anything.

34
00:02:04,270 --> 00:02:05,103
It's bio diverse.
You see with an area that's almost 10 

35
00:02:10,071 --> 00:02:13,380
times smaller than that of Spain or 25 
times smaller than Peru.

36
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:14,263
This country is estimated to have more 
than five percent of all the world's 

37
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:20,240
animal and plant biodiversity in this 
country.

38
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,270
They understand this is not just a sign 
of identity,

39
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:26,690
but also a potentially great competitive
advantage,

40
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,930
for example,
among other things.

41
00:02:29,931 --> 00:02:30,764
It can help develop a differentiated 
tourism industry and position a strong 

42
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,203
country brands that is to say,
one that gives high value to local 

43
00:02:37,731 --> 00:02:39,550
products,
especially for international,

44
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:40,873
yeah,

45
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,430
because they wouldn't be willing to pay 
a bit more for products considered to be

46
00:02:45,431 --> 00:02:49,840
produced cleanly in an environmental 
haven and Costa Rica and while they take

47
00:02:49,841 --> 00:02:52,690
these policies very,
very seriously,

48
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,553
Costa Rica strives to be an ecological 
power is it absolutely is more than 25 

49
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,144
percent of national territory is 
protected and the vast majority of 

50
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:06,040
electricity comes from renewable 
sources,

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,680
hydroelectric,
geothermal and wind power,

52
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:09,573
and not only that,
Costa Rica is the only country in the 

53
00:03:11,711 --> 00:03:12,544
region.
Man's one of the few in the world that 

54
00:03:13,841 --> 00:03:14,674
has managed to reverse deforestation.
The territory covered by forests has 

55
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:23,521
increased from 21 percent in 1987 to 
over 50 percent in the present.

56
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:28,430
The thing that,
by the way,

57
00:03:28,431 --> 00:03:29,264
they achieved thanks to a curious 
payment system for environmental 

58
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:33,830
services.
Allow me to explain this.

59
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:34,723
In Costa Rica,
a part of the taxes on fuels goes to 

60
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,810
funds at Costa Rican forest financing or
funds that pays farm and forest owners.

61
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:42,663
He wants to join the program voluntarily
to conserve their natural space and 

62
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,480
implement projects that help strengthen 
it and that's not all.

63
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:51,343
Many companies also pay into this fund 
to offset their impacts on the 

64
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:54,704
environment.
Something like corporate social 

65
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,440
responsibility that's promoted by the 
states.

66
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,190
Now I think this leads to a really 
interesting debate because for some this

67
00:04:04,191 --> 00:04:05,024
policy is a bit of a monstrosity,
whereas for others it will be a way of 

68
00:04:07,791 --> 00:04:08,624
recognizing the negative externalities 
of productive activities such as the 

69
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:12,613
pollution caused by factories and also 
of course there's the positive 

70
00:04:15,141 --> 00:04:17,300
externalities.
All natural areas,

71
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,093
half of our territory is covered by 
forest and we have an apple system of 

72
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:22,604
protected areas that not only protect an
important part of the planet's 

73
00:04:25,161 --> 00:04:25,994
biodiversity,
but also sustain important sectors of 

74
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:29,480
our economy.
As for example,

75
00:04:29,481 --> 00:04:31,310
tourism.
Carlos Alvarado,

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:33,290
president of Costa Rica.
Personally,

77
00:04:33,291 --> 00:04:34,124
I believe that if these types of 
initiatives are accompanied by policies 

78
00:04:36,381 --> 00:04:39,500
that promote the creation of companies 
and new types of businesses,

79
00:04:39,501 --> 00:04:42,920
they could be really successful.
But let's leave it open to debate.

80
00:04:42,921 --> 00:04:45,440
You can let us know what you think of 
all of this in the comments,

81
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:46,580
but now let's move on.

82
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,853
The fact is that this type of political 
approach doesn't seem to have been at 

83
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,830
odds with the country's economic growth 
since the year 2000.

84
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:01,910
The Costa Rican economy has grown by 
around four percent every year,

85
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:02,803
which even if it doesn't seem like much 
has been a higher average growth rate 

86
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:08,660
than that of the rest of Latin America 
and the OACD countries.

87
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:09,523
Yes,

88
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:11,683
and that's not all Costa Rica is 
undergoing something similar to what we 

89
00:05:13,521 --> 00:05:17,150
saw with New Zealand's.
If we measure variables besides GDP,

90
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:19,190
for example,
if we consider life expectancy,

91
00:05:19,191 --> 00:05:21,140
salaries and situation of companies,
et Cetera,

92
00:05:21,141 --> 00:05:21,974
et Cetera,
I think Costa Rica comes out even 

93
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,700
better.
Take a look at the the Gotham prosperity

94
00:05:28,701 --> 00:05:29,534
index and the ranking of countries by 
GDP per capita in purchasing power 

95
00:05:33,081 --> 00:05:33,914
parity.
That is taking price differences into 

96
00:05:35,661 --> 00:05:38,280
account.
If we do,

97
00:05:38,281 --> 00:05:39,114
we'll notice the Costa Rica is GDP per 
capita is the sixth laundries didn't 

98
00:05:41,971 --> 00:05:43,400
last in America.
That is,

99
00:05:43,401 --> 00:05:44,760
it's below Chile,
Panama,

100
00:05:44,790 --> 00:05:45,623
Uruguay,
Argentina and Mexico and 76 in the 

101
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:49,650
wells.
In the global prosperity index,

102
00:05:49,651 --> 00:05:50,484
Costa Rican rises to the 29th place 
being the second country in Latin 

103
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:54,773
America,
closely behind,

104
00:05:57,930 --> 00:05:58,763
if you want some clear proof,
the average life expectancy in Costa 

105
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:05,150
Rica is the third highest in the entire 
American continents.

106
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,480
Being higher,
for example,

107
00:06:06,481 --> 00:06:11,481
then the last of the United States,
Costa Rica,

108
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,790
it looks like a prosperous,
peaceful country,

109
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:21,190
committed to the preservation of the 
environment,

110
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,140
which all sounds pretty great,
right?

111
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,033
Well,
hold on for a moment because this 

112
00:06:25,001 --> 00:06:25,834
country has another face.
Costa Rica is facing very complicated 

113
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:29,943
challenges,
so listen up challenges that threatened 

114
00:06:38,491 --> 00:06:39,324
the country.

115
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:43,950
Costa Rica is a country that has 
achieved great things,

116
00:06:43,951 --> 00:06:46,680
especially if we can pair this with many
of its neighbors.

117
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:48,660
However,
right now it's facing political,

118
00:06:48,661 --> 00:06:49,494
economic,
and social challenges that threaten its 

119
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:52,920
path to prosperity.
The first one,

120
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,020
clearly it's got a lot to do with the 
economy.

121
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:56,553
See,
even though Costa Rica has had a solid 

122
00:06:58,501 --> 00:07:00,630
performance,
it still has a long way to go.

123
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,493
Currently its GDP per capita is just 
over 40 percent of the average for the 

124
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:05,723
country.

125
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,593
Yes.

126
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:09,790
Here's the problem.
The last government was,

127
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,663
how do you want to say it,
a bit irresponsible with their fiscal 

128
00:07:12,881 --> 00:07:13,714
policy,
which left Costa Rica in a rather 

129
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:18,070
delicate situation only in the last 10 
years.

130
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:22,210
The public debt has more than doubled in
terms of GDP for 2018.

131
00:07:22,211 --> 00:07:23,044
Deficit will approach is seven percent 
and one of every $3 of public spending 

132
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:31,590
will go towards paying that debt.
While in 2008 taxes finance,

133
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:36,040
70 percent of all central government 
expenditures in 2017,

134
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:36,903
they were only enough to finance 50 
percent and the difference had to be 

135
00:07:39,401 --> 00:07:42,250
covered with debtedness Jorge corellas 
consider.

136
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,550
Fortunately,
that seems to be a political consensus.

137
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,840
If the situation doesn't change,
Costa Rica could face several problems,

138
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:53,360
but mainly focusing on raising taxes 
could also be counter productive.

139
00:07:53,390 --> 00:07:54,223
The country's tax on corporate profits 
is already one of the highest in the 

140
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:59,020
world.
It's not only taxes.

141
00:07:59,050 --> 00:08:01,060
For example,
the cost of electricity and fuel,

142
00:08:01,061 --> 00:08:01,894
which lies in the hands of public 
monopolies are among some of the most 

143
00:08:04,451 --> 00:08:07,650
expensive in the region,
which obviously affects competitive.

144
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,573
Yes,

145
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,490
increases like these.
The labor participation rates,

146
00:08:17,491 --> 00:08:20,460
the rate of people who work is really 
rather low.

147
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:21,323
The president's call us Alvarado really 
needs to open up the economy and allow 

148
00:08:24,511 --> 00:08:25,344
competition and if possible,
set apart so that the large public 

149
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:28,794
companies can be shared by Costa Rican.
The second challenge has to do with 

150
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,960
violence.
In recent years,

151
00:08:38,961 --> 00:08:39,794
violence has grown and loss in a country
that was traditionally very safe and 

152
00:08:42,141 --> 00:08:46,190
very quiet and well.
This does have a simple explanation.

153
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:48,980
Drug traffickers,
Yup.

154
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:49,873
As you may already know,
drug traffickers are ravaging a large 

155
00:08:52,431 --> 00:08:53,264
parts of Latin America and now they're 
trying to extend influence to Costa 

156
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,263
Rica,
which is a good path for that much and 

157
00:08:58,571 --> 00:09:01,960
dice third,
well,

158
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,180
the third challenge has a lot to do with
politics.

159
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,043
The last elections were a good example 
of how radical and populist messages 

160
00:09:07,841 --> 00:09:10,430
that targets civil liberties are a great
threat.

161
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:14,160
See the first electoral rounds held in 
February.

162
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:14,994
It wasn't one by Carlos Alvarado this by
for Bricio Alvarado and evangelist 

163
00:09:18,721 --> 00:09:19,554
pastor,
who has a very radical discourse among 

164
00:09:21,751 --> 00:09:22,584
his obsessions with pursuing any 
societal model that differed from what 

165
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:26,003
he perceived as convenient,
especially anything related to equal 

166
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:29,784
marriage,
and of course anyone can see what they 

167
00:09:30,931 --> 00:09:32,910
want and lead their lives however they 
please,

168
00:09:32,911 --> 00:09:33,744
but when a politician wants the 
government to keep devoted itself to 

169
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:39,000
religion and persecute those who don't 
agree with their life model,

170
00:09:39,060 --> 00:09:42,330
it can become really dangerous.
Is Laura Musca.

171
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,270
Fabrizio Alvarado,
his wife in the middle of their campaign

172
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,910
and don't try and tell me that she's not
scary.

173
00:09:59,410 --> 00:10:03,010
Generally in the second round,
this evangelical pastor who's speech had

174
00:10:03,011 --> 00:10:05,320
a lot of hatred and varied as a loved 
suffered,

175
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:08,800
a crushing defeat even though he still 
won 30 percent of the votes,

176
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:09,663
but it's this sort of populism that 
Costa Rica is going to have to be very 

177
00:10:11,741 --> 00:10:13,570
careful within the future,
but it's if view.

178
00:10:13,730 --> 00:10:14,563
That's kind of the way things are.
Carlos Alvarado has just been elected 

179
00:10:18,321 --> 00:10:22,010
president and it's now in his hands to 
get Costa Rica back on track.

180
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:22,873
To achieve this,
you'll have to change a lot of things 

181
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:25,153
and don't forget that the best way to 
fight poverty is by promoting more 

182
00:10:27,981 --> 00:10:30,440
dynamic,
open and competitive economies.

183
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:34,440
Companies are new question going to have
to play a prominent role in order

184
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,333
of this,

185
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,630
but now I see.
What do you think that Costa Rica is?

186
00:10:39,631 --> 00:10:42,660
Green model is one other countries 
should follow.

187
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,600
Do you think the Costa Rica itself is a 
model to follow?

188
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:46,533
