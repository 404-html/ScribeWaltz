1
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,813
Okay.

2
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:16,443
Politic.
We have talked about how we now live in 

3
00:00:17,441 --> 00:00:18,274
a world where every day there is less 
poverty and people are able to live 

4
00:00:20,921 --> 00:00:22,210
better.
Lives are changed.

5
00:00:22,211 --> 00:00:25,180
That is even reaching the most 
unprotected region in the world.

6
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,230
Sub Saharan Africa.

7
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:27,093
Okay.

8
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:32,150
We talked about the African lions and 
paid special attention,

9
00:00:32,151 --> 00:00:34,070
so in cases like Rwanda,
however,

10
00:00:34,071 --> 00:00:37,460
we still need to talk about when and why
this region of the world,

11
00:00:37,461 --> 00:00:40,700
which so many considered hopelessly 
destitute began to change.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:41,743
Sure.

13
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:46,083
Well,
that is precisely what we are going to 

14
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,360
talk about in this video.
That's ams.

15
00:00:49,361 --> 00:00:51,220
What we can expect in the upcoming 
years.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,240
Four years talking about Africa has 
men's talking about extreme poverty,

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:04,103
natural disasters and all kinds of 
conflicts and in a way things are still 

18
00:01:07,681 --> 00:01:08,150
about,
wait,

19
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:08,611
see?
No.

20
00:01:08,611 --> 00:01:10,590
More or less than half.
Yes.

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,543
Half of all the people who suffer from 
extreme poverty in the world live in 

22
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:15,714
these sub Saharan African region.
We're talking about 400 million people 

23
00:01:19,561 --> 00:01:22,170
have also like this isn't surprising 
either.

24
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:24,910
Yeah.

25
00:01:24,910 --> 00:01:29,170
Facing the largest humanitarian crisis 
since the creation of the United Nations

26
00:01:29,171 --> 00:01:30,004
in 1945 now,
more than 20 million people across four 

27
00:01:33,101 --> 00:01:36,670
countries face starvation and famine.
Stephen O'Brien,

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,300
the UN under secretary general for 
humanitarian affairs.

29
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:41,333
Do you do all of this?
I'm sure nobody has the stranger to 

30
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,584
those Ngo campaigns seeking to raise 
funds for all kinds of humanitarian 

31
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,334
catastrophes in Africa.
You're probably also familiar with 

32
00:01:48,751 --> 00:01:49,584
governments allocating billions of 
dollars each year to official 

33
00:01:51,691 --> 00:01:53,170
development assistance.
In fact,

34
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:55,170
government aid is as high as it's ever 
been.

35
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:59,580
Every year the African guns and receives
about $50 billion and this,

36
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:00,510
it's been going on for them

37
00:02:00,510 --> 00:02:01,343
decades.

38
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,840
However,
the truth is that for years,

39
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,640
all of this money,
it didn't help very much.

40
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:11,170
Let's take a look at,
for example,

41
00:02:11,171 --> 00:02:12,004
the 1919

42
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,853
yes

43
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,320
Wallington national aid in this area of 
the world amounts to tens of billions.

44
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:29,350
What do you think happens with poverty?
Do you think it decreased?

45
00:02:29,380 --> 00:02:30,220
Well,
no.

46
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,060
None of that happen.

47
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:31,893
Sure.

48
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,560
1990 and 1998 it's poverty levels went 
from 55% to 58

49
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:40,483
is that,

50
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:43,680
well,
how could this be?

51
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,573
You might ask.
Well because intentions are one thing 

52
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:50,220
but reality is ready difference.
Some experts claim that's it.

53
00:02:50,221 --> 00:02:52,880
For years,
official aid weakens local print

54
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:56,570
juices.
Evidence

55
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,040
overwhelmingly demonstrates that aid to 
Africa has made the poor

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,510
poorer and growth slower.
Dambisa Moyo an economist and the author

57
00:03:04,511 --> 00:03:05,344
of dead aid.
Why aid is not working and how there is 

58
00:03:07,481 --> 00:03:09,430
a better way for Africa.
For example,

59
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:10,264
in Tanzania it was cheaper to buy 
subsidized the milk from the European 

60
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:15,010
Union oven from local producers.
However,

61
00:03:15,011 --> 00:03:18,970
with the beginning of a new century,
suddenly everything began to change

62
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,560
for great change.
Suddenly

63
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:34,800
only when Africa seemed helpless,
everything began to change.

64
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,700
With the beginning of the 21st century,
statistics absolutely turns around.

65
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:39,563
Since the year 2000 and extreme poverty 
has dropped by almost 40% average life 

66
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,090
expectancy has grown by more than 10 
years.

67
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:45,953
Infant mortality has decreased to less 
than half the same as happens with HIV 

68
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:52,140
infections in children as well.
Virtually any other

69
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:57,250
statistic.
If we look good,

70
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,693
the economy will be able to see how 
between 2000 and 2015 sub Saharan 

71
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,060
African countries excluding South 
Africa,

72
00:04:05,061 --> 00:04:05,894
which has a bit of a peculiar case as 
we've seen on visual politic previously 

73
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:11,750
grew by an average of 6% which is more 
than twice,

74
00:04:11,810 --> 00:04:13,250
for example,
Latin America.

75
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:16,340
Another great indicator of how things 
are changing is tourism.

76
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:19,733
Okay?

77
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:21,331
Yup.
Tourism.

78
00:04:21,331 --> 00:04:22,164
You heard that right?
The tourism sector has some particular 

79
00:04:23,791 --> 00:04:26,550
characteristics that reveal a lot of 
information.

80
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,413
On the one hand,
this sector has great transformational 

81
00:04:29,551 --> 00:04:30,384
power for the poorest because it's very 
labor intensive and on the other hand 

82
00:04:33,521 --> 00:04:34,354
can we need to take into account so that
people don't vacation in countries that 

83
00:04:36,781 --> 00:04:39,570
are at war or a famine or have 
epidemics.

84
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:40,404
It's just not a nice holiday.
When this industry improves in the 

85
00:04:43,081 --> 00:04:43,914
poorest countries,
it is usually a good indicator that 

86
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:50,730
things are improving as a whole.
What if we see the data?

87
00:04:50,731 --> 00:04:51,564
We might be quite surprised because this
sector has been growing as an average 

88
00:04:54,241 --> 00:04:57,780
annual rate of no less than 9% for 20 
years.

89
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,720
That is two full decades of nearly 
double digit growth.

90
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:01,583
Yes,
it does seem as if things are really 

91
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:04,253
moving forward,

92
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:05,343
which

93
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:13,830
bought at this point in the video,
you might be wondering something because

94
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:14,723
I certainly am.
What on earth happens to cause such a 

95
00:05:18,301 --> 00:05:19,010
change?
Well,

96
00:05:19,010 --> 00:05:24,010
have a look at this graph because it 
really gives a clue what,

97
00:05:25,750 --> 00:05:27,840
what exactly led to this miracle.
Well,

98
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,733
that's have a look at that.

99
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:34,333
Okay.

100
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:35,740
Airing for takeoff

101
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:38,730
things

102
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,370
drive change,
but we will now see how three particular

103
00:05:41,371 --> 00:05:44,370
events in Africa began to change 
probably permanently.

104
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:47,730
This continence reality,
the first one it was remittances.

105
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:50,730
See in Africa the population grows very 
quickly,

106
00:05:50,731 --> 00:05:53,130
which along with the terrible living 
conditions has led.

107
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,210
Many Africans do immigrates to rich 
countries in the past few decades.

108
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,723
Today,
these people send tens of billions of 

109
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:01,243
dollars home every year.
This money is used in local markets or 

110
00:06:03,441 --> 00:06:04,274
to set up businesses.
These are what we call remittances ans 

111
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,514
they are actually much more important 
than developmental eight seconds and 

112
00:06:11,511 --> 00:06:12,344
very importantly,
in March of 2000 the u s Congress 

113
00:06:14,091 --> 00:06:14,924
finally approved a law that had been 
promoted by Bill Clinton in his last 

114
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:18,913
years in office.
It's called the African Growth and 

115
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:23,390
Opportunity Act.
This is basically a law that establishes

116
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,224
a preferential trade agreements that 
eliminates terrorists and reduces 

117
00:06:26,841 --> 00:06:27,674
barriers to trade for thousands and 
thousands of products from sub Saharan 

118
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,440
Africa.
See,

119
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:35,293
since this agreement was approved,
we can see that between 2000 and 2016 

120
00:06:38,361 --> 00:06:40,160
which went exactly the most prosperous 
years,

121
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:44,690
have a trade between the United States 
in sub Saharan Africa multiplied two and

122
00:06:44,691 --> 00:06:45,524
a half times,
which means a 6% growth every year and 

123
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:54,470
third and perhaps the key to everything.
There's China.

124
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:54,951
Yup.
Yeah.

125
00:06:54,951 --> 00:06:56,780
Have the rights.
In 2001 China,

126
00:06:56,781 --> 00:06:57,614
it joins the World Trade Organization as
became something of a factory to the 

127
00:07:01,101 --> 00:07:01,851
world.
Well,

128
00:07:01,851 --> 00:07:03,980
what has happened since then has been 
quite impressive.

129
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:08,120
China's huge grief has lifted tens of 
millions of people out of poverty,

130
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:10,040
both in China and in Africa.

131
00:07:10,190 --> 00:07:15,190
Government of China and that was when in
the honest thing,

132
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:20,570
Ethiopia's industrialization and on 
supporting the yes,

133
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:23,810
great vision to become Africa's 
manufacturing.

134
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:24,993
Oh,

135
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:30,373
to explain myself yet the Asian giants,
gigantic grief has increased this 

136
00:07:33,051 --> 00:07:35,390
country's demands for all kinds of 
products,

137
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,620
raw materials,
food,

138
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,300
manufacturing,
everything.

139
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,480
Well,
many African countries took advantage of

140
00:07:41,481 --> 00:07:42,314
this opportunity since the year 2000 to 
trade between China and Africa has 

141
00:07:45,351 --> 00:07:46,184
multiplied by no less than the 17 times 
representing an annual growth rate of 

142
00:07:49,851 --> 00:07:54,851
almost 20% since 2009 China is already 
by far the continent's largest trading.

143
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:55,450
Yeah.

144
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:56,283
Partner.

145
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,950
There's not only that,
the Chinese,

146
00:07:59,951 --> 00:08:00,784
as we mentioned here have also been 
investing a lot of money all over the 

147
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:06,650
world and Africa is certainly no 
exception.

148
00:08:06,651 --> 00:08:07,484
Yeah.
In 2016 four out of every 10 euros that 

149
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:15,200
Farhan is invested in,
Africa came from China.

150
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:16,063
Today more than 10,000 Chinese companies
are doing business on the African 

151
00:08:18,501 --> 00:08:21,470
continent is can I sleep?
Private companies that work in all kinds

152
00:08:21,471 --> 00:08:23,860
of industries and that number one,
it just keeps running.

153
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:28,850
Yes.
My friends.

154
00:08:28,880 --> 00:08:29,713
This is how Africa has managed to start 
turning the statistics around the 

155
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,370
greatest catalyst for this entire 
change.

156
00:08:34,371 --> 00:08:35,204
It wasn't some kind of miracle and it 
didn't have much to do with 

157
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:38,253
developmental aid.
This change was driven by trade and 

158
00:08:41,061 --> 00:08:41,894
investments and Africans themselves seem
to see it very clearly and if you don't 

159
00:08:44,931 --> 00:08:46,640
believe me,
I'll take a look at this.

160
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:48,313
African countries are forging ahead to 
complete negotiations for continental 

161
00:08:52,191 --> 00:08:56,520
free trade area between 55 countries by 
early next year.

162
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,443
The idea adopted by the African Union in
2012 is to create a single market which 

163
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:04,830
includes the free movement of goods,
services and people.

164
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,970
Yes,
that's right.

165
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:09,720
Africa is working to expand the trade to
every corner of the continents.

166
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:11,610
Not all countries are developing 
equally,

167
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,533
but this is quite normal and then all 
parts of the world following the Asian 

168
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:20,754
Star

169
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:24,830
points,
we need to ask ourselves the question,

170
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:28,070
can we really dream of Africa's final 
takeoff?

171
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:28,933
See,
I suspect that many of you are probably 

172
00:09:29,721 --> 00:09:30,554
thinking right now.
Well everything you say in visual 

173
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,624
politic is very nice,
but it isn't usually what really 

174
00:09:35,181 --> 00:09:35,961
happens.
Well,

175
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:36,651
yes,
in Africa,

176
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,484
it's absolutely true that all countries 
that are doing well and there are 

177
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,420
countries that are not doing well,
but you know what?

178
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,700
That's true,
but it's also really normal.

179
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:45,230
See,
it may sound shocking today,

180
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,620
but in the 1950s Asia was this poor as 
Africa.

181
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:50,510
I mean today we can look at cities like 
Shanghai,

182
00:09:50,511 --> 00:09:51,530
Hong Kong,
Taipei.

183
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,130
It makes it really hard to imagine that 
these places will.

184
00:09:54,131 --> 00:09:54,964
One is pork.
The when South Korea or Taiwan began to 

185
00:09:56,961 --> 00:09:57,794
grow,
they weren't richer than Ghana or 

186
00:09:59,001 --> 00:10:00,890
Senegal for example,
and China,

187
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:02,750
India and Vietnam era.
Of course,

188
00:10:02,751 --> 00:10:03,620
way poorer.

189
00:10:05,660 --> 00:10:06,493
Okay,

190
00:10:11,330 --> 00:10:12,163
can absolutely draw some really 
interesting ideas from this because 

191
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:17,900
Asian countries didn't grow all at once 
and they didn't grow all together.

192
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,010
While Korea,
Singapore,

193
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:20,540
Japan,
and Taiwan grew.

194
00:10:20,570 --> 00:10:22,660
Other countries such as China,
Indonesia,

195
00:10:22,661 --> 00:10:24,030
and India remains in mass

196
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,173
poverty.

197
00:10:26,770 --> 00:10:27,603
They weren't exactly democratic models.
South Korea and Taiwan were under hard 

198
00:10:30,551 --> 00:10:34,210
dictatorships until very recently.
Singapore is in a similar state.

199
00:10:34,690 --> 00:10:35,351
China,
well,

200
00:10:35,351 --> 00:10:40,330
what can I say in shorts and lots of 
poverty,

201
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,220
some more advanced countries with 
others.

202
00:10:42,221 --> 00:10:44,110
Further behind is plenty of 
dictatorships.

203
00:10:44,140 --> 00:10:44,973
Essentially what we're seeing in Africa 
today wasn't so different from what was 

204
00:10:47,561 --> 00:10:49,300
happening in Asia just 50 years ago.

205
00:10:55,010 --> 00:10:55,310
Ready

206
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:59,340
for takeoff?
Yes.

207
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,240
Things in Africa are changing after the 
10 countries that are apparently growing

208
00:11:03,241 --> 00:11:06,540
the most in 2017 five are in Africa.

209
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:10,990
If we

210
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,180
take a look at the latest to doing 
business reports,

211
00:11:13,181 --> 00:11:16,630
the wells bank indicator for measuring 
how easy it is to do business in certain

212
00:11:16,631 --> 00:11:19,210
economies,
we can see the towns of the 10 countries

213
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:21,790
that have improved the most for are also
African.

214
00:11:23,590 --> 00:11:24,423
True poverty here is still very high and
these countries are facing a difficult 

215
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,360
challenge.
Indeed,

216
00:11:28,361 --> 00:11:29,194
the large population growth on the 
continent is actually going to multiply 

217
00:11:31,601 --> 00:11:33,250
in the upcoming decades.
However,

218
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:35,680
the good news is that everything 
indicates,

219
00:11:35,740 --> 00:11:38,170
but thanks to trade and international 
investments.

220
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,730
Africa is finding its way and it's maybe
once and for all is ready for takeoff,

221
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,430
but I would see what town do you think 
that Africa will emulate,

222
00:11:45,431 --> 00:11:48,220
the developments that Asia has had in 
recent decades?

223
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,083
