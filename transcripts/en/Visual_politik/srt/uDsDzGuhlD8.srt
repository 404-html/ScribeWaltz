1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,610
Pearson is kind of like your boss.
You don't like him,

3
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:12,260
you don't trust him.
But yeah,

4
00:00:12,261 --> 00:00:14,960
absolutely do need him to pay your 
bills.

5
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:15,853
Now,
it's been a long time since we talked 

6
00:00:16,581 --> 00:00:20,510
about Putin here on visual politic and I
know what you're thinking now.

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:24,750
Okay.

8
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:25,710
Again,
Simon,

9
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:29,210
and we rarely gonna talk about oil.
I mean do it to death.

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:30,044
Why don't you,
well actually this time we're not 

11
00:00:31,941 --> 00:00:33,440
talking about oil.
Exactly.

12
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:36,110
We're talking about natural gas.
Now,

13
00:00:36,111 --> 00:00:36,944
many of you might think that these are 
actually very similar things because at 

14
00:00:39,441 --> 00:00:42,320
the end of the day,
countries with oil reserves usually have

15
00:00:42,321 --> 00:00:45,650
gas reserves too,
but there is a difference.

16
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:49,000
Oil markets are way more diversified.
For example,

17
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:51,620
Europe obeys 30% of their crude oil from
Russia,

18
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:52,454
but when it comes to the gas,
then number rises to 40% but if we look 

19
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:59,690
at each individual European country,
the dependency is way higher.

20
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:00,583
Germany imports 60% of their gas from 
Russia and other countries like Finland 

21
00:01:03,831 --> 00:01:06,560
in the Baltics depends entirely on 
Russian gas.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:07,633
In other words,
Putin could leave these countries 

23
00:01:09,141 --> 00:01:11,570
freezing on a cold,
cold wind tonight.

24
00:01:11,810 --> 00:01:16,130
That would honestly make game of thrones
look kind of like Baywatch.

25
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,313
Hold on a minute here because there's 
more to this resource than heating in 

26
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,124
facts.
We need natural gas for many of the 

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,310
things.
In fact,

28
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:32,360
domestic and assumption is just a third 
of the

29
00:01:32,410 --> 00:01:33,243
total

30
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,363
as you can see on this chart.
Another third is for thermal power 

31
00:01:39,771 --> 00:01:42,980
plants,
but the biggest share is used by various

32
00:01:42,981 --> 00:01:44,240
industries.
For example,

33
00:01:44,241 --> 00:01:46,970
a paper manufacturing company needs 
thermal energy.

34
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:49,670
This means heat in order to get this 
eat.

35
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:53,330
The factory uses gas and the same goes 
for many,

36
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:55,490
many other industries.
In other words,

37
00:01:55,491 --> 00:02:00,491
gas is extremely important to everybody 
and that includes Europe and now can you

38
00:02:00,501 --> 00:02:03,920
guess who is the biggest consumer of gas
in all of Europe?

39
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:06,260
Yup,
of course that would be Germany,

40
00:02:06,261 --> 00:02:07,094
the most populous country on the 
continent and also the one with the 

41
00:02:09,501 --> 00:02:13,940
largest economy,
and this is the key to our story because

42
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:17,060
as long as Germany remains so dependent 
on Russia,

43
00:02:17,090 --> 00:02:20,060
all of Europe is going to depend on 
Russia too.

44
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:23,300
And this is why during the 2018 NATO 
summit,

45
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:26,360
Donald Trump said things like this,

46
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,480
Germany is totally controlled by Russia 
because they were getting from 60 to 70%

47
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:34,760
of their energy from Russia and a new 
pipeline,

48
00:02:35,330 --> 00:02:38,420
and you'd tell me if that's appropriate 
because I think it's not then.

49
00:02:38,421 --> 00:02:39,980
I think it's a very bad thing for NATO.

50
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,340
All right,
so the question today is trump,

51
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:43,174
right when he criticizes Germany,
is it really a problem that Germany has 

52
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:50,650
such a high dependency on Russian gas 
and more importantly,

53
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:54,040
is there a true attempt to reduce that 
dependency?

54
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:56,110
Well,
today we're going to answer all of those

55
00:02:56,111 --> 00:02:57,580
questions,
but as always,

56
00:02:57,581 --> 00:03:00,580
before we do last,
take a look back at the history

57
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,460
man in Berlin,
there are two ways of transporting gas.

58
00:03:10,461 --> 00:03:11,294
The cheapest one is through a pipeline.
This means we build a huge pipe that 

59
00:03:14,511 --> 00:03:18,920
goes from the place we take the gas,
see the Yamal peninsula in Russia to the

60
00:03:18,921 --> 00:03:20,690
country that buys it.
For example,

61
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:22,880
Germany.
This is very cheap because,

62
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:24,730
yeah,
just need to build the pipelines.

63
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:27,080
There you go.
There's no need for trucks.

64
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:28,580
There's no need for ships.
This,

65
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:29,653
nothing like that.
Since you transport the gas through the 

66
00:03:31,731 --> 00:03:33,530
pipes,
it comes to the power plants,

67
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,500
the houses and the factories all 
directly.

68
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,510
There is also an alternative method 
though,

69
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:43,090
and that's so called liquified natural 
gas or l and g.

70
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,630
So how does this work?
Well,

71
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:52,950
let's say we take our guests from 
cutoff.

72
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:58,300
What we do is we lowered its temperature
until it's 161 Celsius below zero.

73
00:03:58,790 --> 00:04:03,410
This is the point when the gas becomes 
liquid and you can store it in bottles.

74
00:04:03,470 --> 00:04:04,303
These bottles can then be stored on a 
ship and sent to say Barcelona in Spain 

75
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:09,463
there they have a regassification plants
where they heat to the liquid until it 

76
00:04:12,171 --> 00:04:13,004
becomes gas again.
The gas thing goes to the national pipe 

77
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:15,794
network and that's when it's transported
to houses and factories and things like 

78
00:04:19,311 --> 00:04:22,550
that.
So what's the advantage of this process?

79
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:23,413
Well,
it allows Europe to diversify their gas 

80
00:04:25,371 --> 00:04:27,440
providers easily.
But what's the problem?

81
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:30,860
Uh,
it's 50 to 70% more expensive than using

82
00:04:30,861 --> 00:04:32,690
those pipelines.
We mentioned previously,

83
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:36,200
and this,
this is why European countries buy their

84
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,770
gas from the closest to producers that 
were using pipelines.

85
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:40,693
For example,
the biggest supplier of Spain is 

86
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:43,700
Algeria,
but the northern countries,

87
00:04:43,701 --> 00:04:46,640
they buy gas from Norway and especially 
Russia.

88
00:04:46,910 --> 00:04:49,800
As we said before,
countries like rough snaps or luke,

89
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:53,760
I'll export more than half of the gas 
consumed in Germany and this,

90
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:54,633
well,
what about the country is located 

91
00:04:55,191 --> 00:04:56,780
between Germany and Russia?
Well,

92
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,490
they haven't even deeper dependency.
Just have a look at this.

93
00:05:00,491 --> 00:05:00,880
Yeah.

94
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,713
Wow.

95
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,490
Pay Attention.
You'll see how Poland depends on Russian

96
00:05:08,491 --> 00:05:11,160
gas.
The 75% of its needs.

97
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:13,260
Other countries like Finland is in 
Romania.

98
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:16,380
They go all the way up to 100%.
In other words,

99
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,940
half of Europe needs Russia in order to 
simply survive,

100
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,730
and this is no secret.
The European Commission,

101
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:27,570
they know about it and believe me,
Vladimir Putin knows about it too.

102
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:28,873
Germany will become totally dependent on
Russian energy if it does not 

103
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:39,221
immediately change course.
Here in the Western Hemisphere.

104
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,443
We are committed to maintaining our 
independence from the encroachment of 

105
00:05:47,811 --> 00:05:50,490
expansionist foreign powers.
But

106
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,420
let's pause the video here for just a 
moment.

107
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:56,150
Right here we can see the German 
delegation laughing at trump.

108
00:05:56,270 --> 00:06:00,350
He just said that will become totally 
dependent on Russian energy.

109
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:02,340
This means if they were already 
dependence,

110
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,200
they will become even more dependence.
So what is he talking about exactly?

111
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:08,570
Well,
let's rewind the video.

112
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,560
Remember this name?
Gerhard schrader.

113
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:24,680
Here's the former German chancellor,
the predessessors of Angela Merkel.

114
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:25,633
He still maintains a massive influence 
in German and European politics and 

115
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,430
well,
what does he do now?

116
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:33,490
Well,
actually he's building v

117
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:37,660
former,

118
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,320
no chief rest Mohsen Germany walks into 
Putin's trap,

119
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,610
Nord Stream two basically Nord stream 
two is a brand new pipeline,

120
00:06:45,611 --> 00:06:46,444
but we're to go under the Baltic Sea 
connecting Germany with Russia with no 

121
00:06:49,451 --> 00:06:50,284
middle man with this new pipeline,
Germany could double the import of 

122
00:06:52,841 --> 00:06:53,674
Russian gas.
Since this project has a shareholder 

123
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,100
committee with companies like the 
Russian giant Gazprom and the presidents

124
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:02,590
of this committee is of course Mr. 
Schroeder.

125
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:05,200
If this isn't enough.
The former German chancellor is also the

126
00:07:05,201 --> 00:07:07,680
president of Ross.
NAFSA rational.

127
00:07:07,681 --> 00:07:12,681
Yeah.
This is wine.

128
00:07:13,970 --> 00:07:14,803
The last 10 years,
Schroeder has become Putin's man in 

129
00:07:17,181 --> 00:07:18,200
Europe.
In fact,

130
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,063
he has defended Russia in all kinds of 
matters from the cyber attacks against 

131
00:07:22,581 --> 00:07:25,220
the Estonian governments do the Crimean 
invasion.

132
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,233
In other words,
far from reducing that dependence on 

133
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:28,934
Russia.
Germany is giving him the opposite 

134
00:07:30,471 --> 00:07:31,304
direction.
So what were those Germans laughing 

135
00:07:33,021 --> 00:07:34,730
about?
Honestly,

136
00:07:35,090 --> 00:07:37,010
I don't have any idea,
but all right.

137
00:07:37,011 --> 00:07:38,570
All right.
I know what you're thinking right now.

138
00:07:38,571 --> 00:07:42,050
What was the problem with depends on 
quite so much on Russia.

139
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:48,610
Maybe it's because Putin's an 
authoritarian ruler,

140
00:07:48,850 --> 00:07:49,683
but seriously it's not because if that 
was the case or where else would we buy 

141
00:07:53,111 --> 00:07:53,944
gas from?
I mean the other list of suppliers 

142
00:07:55,220 --> 00:07:58,030
includes as a [inaudible],
Algeria and Qatar,

143
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:58,983
which of course we all know a healthy 
democracy is governed by wonderful 

144
00:08:03,131 --> 00:08:04,340
people.
Bullock.

145
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,253
The reality is no one really gives a 
shit about democracy and human rights 

146
00:08:07,331 --> 00:08:09,030
when it comes to having heating in 
[inaudible].

147
00:08:09,250 --> 00:08:10,083
Now,
the problem with defending on Russia is 

148
00:08:11,651 --> 00:08:14,550
something else and that's something 
you're going to understand right now.

149
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,653
Russia holics in Leah,
2006 Gazprom ones at the Ukrainians to 

150
00:08:23,261 --> 00:08:24,094
pay six times more for gas in.
This was a 100% political move for 

151
00:08:28,601 --> 00:08:29,434
decades.
Russia and Ukraine had this really good 

152
00:08:30,581 --> 00:08:31,414
relationship and then the orange 
revolution began when Victor Yushchenko 

153
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:37,960
came to power with his auntie Russian 
and pro European rhetoric.

154
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:41,520
The Kremlin essentially said this or I 
Ukraine.

155
00:08:41,530 --> 00:08:42,940
Well,
if you want to go and hang out with your

156
00:08:42,941 --> 00:08:44,740
cool European friends and forget about 
us,

157
00:08:44,741 --> 00:08:48,960
well get your wallet out because it's 
going to be expensive.

158
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,883
I think about it.
Building a brand new pipeline with 

159
00:08:51,281 --> 00:08:53,230
another country,
it takes years,

160
00:08:53,260 --> 00:08:54,093
so Ukraine,
they just couldn't find a new supplier 

161
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:59,340
overnight if booths in one sense,
he could raise prices at well,

162
00:08:59,341 --> 00:09:00,174
men's,
if you crane doesn't want to pay us 

163
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,300
well,
Russia or we'll just close the pipe

164
00:09:07,550 --> 00:09:10,040
for three days in the middle of a cold 
wave,

165
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:14,090
Ukrainians had no heating at home and 
after a tense negotiation,

166
00:09:14,150 --> 00:09:19,150
Ukraine agreed to pay double for the gas
exchange.

167
00:09:22,460 --> 00:09:26,990
It raised the fee that Russia had to pay
in order to cross the country,

168
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:30,150
transport the gas to the rest of Europe 
bus.

169
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:34,020
This was just the beginning.
In the year 2009 we had the same problem

170
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:35,123
but rather king sized.
Russia wanted Ukraine to pay more for 

171
00:09:38,191 --> 00:09:39,300
their gas.
Once again,

172
00:09:39,390 --> 00:09:40,223
Kevin Moscow started insulting each 
other and in this case it was not only 

173
00:09:43,561 --> 00:09:45,420
Ukraine,
the one without gas for days,

174
00:09:45,421 --> 00:09:48,690
it was also the rest of Europe and that 
included the Czech Republic,

175
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:51,600
Italy,
Poland's and of course Germany.

176
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,670
Yes,
dear us,

177
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:54,840
most of that Russian gas comes through 
Ukraine,

178
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:55,674
so if Ukrainians have no gas to the 
Johnson's are other Europeans are going 

179
00:09:58,411 --> 00:10:00,000
to be freezing too.
Again,

180
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:00,834
the story ends with Ukraine paying more 
for their gas in exchange for more 

181
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,760
transport fees.
Nevertheless,

182
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:06,623
just like game of thrones,
Putin's tune is a song of ice and fire 

183
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:11,543
after freezing Europeans in 2006 and 
2009 2014 when it was the year of fire 

184
00:10:17,010 --> 00:10:19,410
and the fire came in a Ukrainian 
province,

185
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,520
core Crimea

186
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:25,663
because as you know,
Russians took it and so what did the 

187
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,800
European Union doing this case?
Well,

188
00:10:30,801 --> 00:10:32,690
they just came to Peterson and 
essentially said,

189
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:35,510
who's in your very naughty boy?
We're going to sanction you.

190
00:10:35,511 --> 00:10:37,790
When do you all write these lines?
20 Times over?

191
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:41,210
I will not invade other countries.
I will not invade other countries.

192
00:10:41,211 --> 00:10:42,044
I will not invade other countries.
Now Ukraine is more of a headache than 

193
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:46,514
anything else,
but that's something we're going to 

194
00:10:47,511 --> 00:10:50,990
cover in the next video of this series 
because yes,

195
00:10:50,991 --> 00:10:53,780
we all doing a series all about Russian 
gas.

196
00:10:53,781 --> 00:10:56,180
And if you don't want to miss it,
well you know what to do this,

197
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:58,730
this of dry and below in a ballad,
do your thing.

198
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,640
So now Europe has two options.
Putin,

199
00:11:01,641 --> 00:11:02,474
Andy Schrader,
they want to build new pipelines to 

200
00:11:03,861 --> 00:11:06,620
bypass Ukraine.
That is the first option.

201
00:11:06,770 --> 00:11:07,603
The second one is what the European 
Union once and that's defined other gas 

202
00:11:11,211 --> 00:11:12,800
suppliers,
but well,

203
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:13,693
can they really do that now pay 
attention because we're going to answer 

204
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:21,101
that question.
Attempts to diversify.

205
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:26,860
The fastest way of diversifying is,
you guessed it,

206
00:11:26,890 --> 00:11:30,100
buying liquefied natural gas.
Now it is expensive,

207
00:11:30,101 --> 00:11:33,220
but countries do not need to wait to 
build new pipelines.

208
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:34,690
So what's the problem there?
Well,

209
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,270
LNG ships are too busy with the Asian 
market,

210
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:43,720
basically.

211
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:46,060
Great.
The Pacific Ocean is full of these ships

212
00:11:46,061 --> 00:11:48,010
that can go from Australia,
Qatar,

213
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:50,290
and to Malaysia to Japan,
China.

214
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:50,690
Okay.

215
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,523
Yeah.

216
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,413
You see in Asia,
gas prices are higher than anywhere 

217
00:11:58,131 --> 00:11:58,964
else.
So Good Luck convincing America rock 

218
00:12:00,471 --> 00:12:01,304
guitar to sell you.
Then natural gas when they're getting 

219
00:12:03,381 --> 00:12:06,500
rich off Asia.
This is why the most realistic option is

220
00:12:06,501 --> 00:12:09,080
to build new pipelines.
The question is though,

221
00:12:09,530 --> 00:12:10,363
wow,

222
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,370
so on the one hands,
we have no way.

223
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:23,450
This Europe already buys all of the gas 
they produce.

224
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,313
Going south,
we have Spain who wants to build the 

225
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:29,450
midcap pipeline that would connect to 
Algeria with northern Europe,

226
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:30,313
but France is not very excited about the
idea because that would mean they have 

227
00:12:33,051 --> 00:12:35,990
to build the whole that in order to sell
to other countries.

228
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,700
Um,
well,

229
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:39,770
you know,
Oh man,

230
00:12:39,771 --> 00:12:44,510
this is so much walk.
Maybe tomorrow or maybe never.

231
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:45,921
Maybe never.
Never.

232
00:12:45,921 --> 00:12:47,120
Sounds good.
All right.

233
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:47,954
So then we have serious alternative so 
far as the so called Trans Adriatic 

234
00:12:51,021 --> 00:12:54,740
pipeline or tap.
This is meant to be finished by 2020.

235
00:12:54,890 --> 00:12:58,610
This pipeline goes from Azerbaijan 
crosses Turkey and goes all the way into

236
00:12:58,611 --> 00:12:59,930
Italy.
But wait a minute,

237
00:12:59,931 --> 00:13:00,764
because this still is not enough.
This pipeline has a maximum capacity of 

238
00:13:04,041 --> 00:13:04,874
20 billion cubic meters of gas.
This isn't even a half the capacity of 

239
00:13:08,331 --> 00:13:11,480
the Nord Stream two that connects 
Germany and Russia.

240
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:14,180
But this is not the only problem when it
comes to oil.

241
00:13:14,181 --> 00:13:15,014
Putin is a fairy jealous boyfriends.
And if you thought he would put up with 

242
00:13:18,951 --> 00:13:22,420
so much gas promiscuity when you're very
wrong.

243
00:13:26,210 --> 00:13:26,880
Gas

244
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:27,713
promises,
gas transit via Ukraine to Europe may 

245
00:13:30,361 --> 00:13:33,960
fall to 10 to 15 billion cubic meters 
per year.

246
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,170
With this move,
Putin kills two birds with one stone.

247
00:13:37,171 --> 00:13:41,340
Firsties forcing Europe to follow him 
and on top of that he bypasses Ukraine.

248
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:44,250
But this is not the end of the story 
here in the south.

249
00:13:44,251 --> 00:13:46,860
Putin is also pushing to build brand new
pipes.

250
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:47,703
And yesterday if it was,
if you thought Gerhard Schroeder is the 

251
00:13:50,431 --> 00:13:54,160
only friend of Vladimir Putin in Europe,
well you're all very,

252
00:13:54,180 --> 00:13:54,690
very good.

253
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:58,980
Rome hungry

254
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:03,380
once Russia's Turkish stream pipeline to
be extended into Europe.

255
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:06,410
But still there are two points we 
haven't dealt with her for one,

256
00:14:06,411 --> 00:14:07,244
we have to talk about Ukraine.
Can Putin totally bypass them on top of 

257
00:14:10,551 --> 00:14:11,384
that,
we should definitely talk about as a 

258
00:14:12,171 --> 00:14:15,530
budget on another dictatorship that will
become Europe's best friend.

259
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:17,480

do you subscribe to this channel?
Meanwhile,

261
00:14:20,210 --> 00:14:21,043
I've got a question for you.
Do you think Putin can reduce its 

262
00:14:22,851 --> 00:14:23,684
dependency on Russia or do you think 
Putin will become the night king with 

263
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:30,350
enough power to turn Europeans into 
white walkers?

264
