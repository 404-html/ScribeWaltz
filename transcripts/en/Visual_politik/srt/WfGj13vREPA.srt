1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,280
There's a country that always,
always,

2
00:00:02,281 --> 00:00:03,114
always,
always appears in the headlines of 

3
00:00:03,751 --> 00:00:07,080
international newspapers,
and it's for two main reasons why one of

4
00:00:07,081 --> 00:00:09,390
them soccer and the other is economic 
crisis.

5
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,390
The problem,
my friends lately,

6
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,270
these headlines on having more to do 
with crises on the football,

7
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:18,140
I am of course talking about Argentina.

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,220
Yeah.

9
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:26,053
It's hard to say,
but Argentina is a country that is as 

10
00:00:28,221 --> 00:00:31,400
allergic to reforms as it is addicted to
crises.

11
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:36,200
When everything seemed to be going well,
2018 suddenly became very,

12
00:00:36,201 --> 00:00:38,940
very complicated.
So much so that we're ECO Macra,

13
00:00:38,950 --> 00:00:42,830
he's governments has been forced to to 
ask for a bailout from the international

14
00:00:42,831 --> 00:00:43,664
monetary funds.
So now you might be thinking really a 

15
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:48,470
bailout Argentina again.
Well,

16
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,270
yes,
you heard it right.

17
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,163
Argentina,
the country of tango is back on the 

18
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:55,160
ropes,
so listen up.

19
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:01,063
Okay.

20
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,730
April and May of 2018 haven't exactly 
been great months for Argentina.

21
00:01:15,820 --> 00:01:16,653
Okay.

22
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:25,380
That condition and 
[inaudible]. [inaudible]

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:28,500
[inaudible].
That's who we ended up.

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,580
Sandy [inaudible] are the basis the 
American,

25
00:01:32,581 --> 00:01:33,414
yeah,

26
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:34,443
thanks.

27
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:36,653
And just a few weeks of pay.
So it was depreciated by 20% going from 

28
00:01:40,291 --> 00:01:41,124
an exchange rate of one US dollar for 20
pesos to an exchange rate of $1 getting 

29
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:49,910
you 25 pesos.
You know what?

30
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,013
There's not exactly surprising since the
beginning of 2018 Argentina's currency 

31
00:01:54,770 --> 00:01:59,770
has depreciated by at 25% and if we 
extended that time frame to five years,

32
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,360
could you guess how much the peso has 
depreciated since then?

33
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,283
Well,
the reality is that it's been an 

34
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:12,610
absolutely brutal 80% appreciation.
Make no mistake as though the plummeting

35
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:26,190
exchange rate isn't the problem.
It's the consequence

36
00:02:27,710 --> 00:02:28,543
you see,

37
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:33,570
you Argentina's real problem lies in its
addiction to public spending.

38
00:02:33,721 --> 00:02:34,554
And I'm not saying the public spending 
is slightly higher than they can afford 

39
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,214
here after they have such high public 
spending that Argentina simply has no 

40
00:02:42,301 --> 00:02:43,350
ability to afford it.

41
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:44,530
Okay?

42
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:45,363
In the last 57 years,
we spent 53 years with the state 

43
00:02:48,671 --> 00:02:52,180
spending more than it collects.
That is with the fiscal deficits.

44
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:55,420
And during those 53 years,
we had four huge crises.

45
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:58,990
Now we're fighting to avoid a fifth one,
Jose Luis,

46
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,490
Bert and Argentine

47
00:03:00,550 --> 00:03:01,383
economist.
But I know what you might be thinking 

48
00:03:03,671 --> 00:03:05,050
right now.
You're probably thinking,

49
00:03:05,051 --> 00:03:05,884
Simon,
what the hell does public spending have 

50
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:10,330
to do with the pcs depreciation?
Well,

51
00:03:10,331 --> 00:03:14,470
actually much more than you'd think.
So let's go through it step by step.

52
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:28,470
Argentina is facing eight triple time 
bomb.

53
00:03:28,471 --> 00:03:32,280
It has a huge external deficits,
a huge public deficits,

54
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,310
and $250 billion of external desk.
Of course,

55
00:03:37,531 --> 00:03:38,364
as you can imagine,
both the deficits and the dads have to 

56
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,244
be paid.
Here's where that first big problem 

57
00:03:43,651 --> 00:03:46,290
appears.
He is,

58
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:48,900
and he is a protectionism,
devaluations,

59
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:51,810
hyper regulation,
and very high taxes.

60
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:52,673
Indeed,
Argentina is one of the countries with 

61
00:03:54,031 --> 00:03:57,090
the highest business taxes on the entire
planet.

62
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,360
Now,
all of this has stopped.

63
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,180
The industry ends,
the Argentine economy in general,

64
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:06,020
from being competitive.
It's also caused capitalists.

65
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:10,230
Do you flee the country long ago in such
a refuge somewhere else?

66
00:04:13,170 --> 00:04:14,970
I mean,
it's a little sounds pretty logical,

67
00:04:14,971 --> 00:04:16,860
right?
And so what's the result of this?

68
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,510
Well,
since there's no money at home,

69
00:04:18,511 --> 00:04:22,170
Argentina has become very dependent on 
foreign financing.

70
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:24,960
According to the Institute of 
International Finance,

71
00:04:24,961 --> 00:04:29,961
most almost 64% of Argentina's state and
corporate debt is denominated in dollars

72
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,313
and other foreign currency.
That's why both the volume of central 

73
00:04:36,221 --> 00:04:38,710
bank reserves and the exchange rate of 
very,

74
00:04:38,860 --> 00:04:39,820
very important.
Yeah,

75
00:04:44,950 --> 00:04:46,060
of course,
on the one hand,

76
00:04:46,061 --> 00:04:48,580
they need to pay for imports and deal 
with debt payments,

77
00:04:48,581 --> 00:04:51,640
but since Argentina has a negative 
external balance,

78
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:54,040
that is,
it consumes more dollars than it gets.

79
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:57,130
It needs someone to lend them those 
dollars.

80
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:00,640
It needs investors to bring money into 
the country

81
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,513
and my friends,
if investors don't lend that money 

82
00:05:06,711 --> 00:05:10,400
because they don't trust the country,
then Argentina has a problem,

83
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:12,340
a really big problem.
On the other hands,

84
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:15,980
if the peso depreciates,
then obviously it loses value in folks.

85
00:05:15,981 --> 00:05:16,814
Let's be honest,
nobody wants to have their savings in a 

86
00:05:18,471 --> 00:05:20,420
currency that the is so cool.

87
00:05:20,470 --> 00:05:21,303
Okay,

88
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:31,250
sorry.
Well,

89
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,560
what do you do in that situation?
Well,

90
00:05:33,561 --> 00:05:34,394
essentially what you do is you rush to 
exchange all of your pieces for a 

91
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:40,220
stronger and more stable currency and 
well,

92
00:05:40,221 --> 00:05:41,054
that's exactly what the population are 
doing and that is causing the currency 

93
00:05:44,601 --> 00:05:46,370
to collapse.
Even further,

94
00:05:46,430 --> 00:05:50,360
and of course that leaves two reserves 
being consumed even faster,

95
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:51,860
but all right,
having said that,

96
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,030
let's take a look at that.
Yeah.

97
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,040
See,

98
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:01,730
both Nesta catch now ran the specialty.
Cristina Fernandez de Kartchner,

99
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:04,100
the two previous presidents of 
Argentina,

100
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,993
they like to spend quite freely.
When they came to power in 2002 public 

101
00:06:09,471 --> 00:06:13,880
spending was equivalent to 23% of GDP 
when they left,

102
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,000
when it was more like 40% now you might 
be wondering,

103
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:18,590
well,
what did they do with all the money?

104
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:21,110
Well,
basically they hired public employees to

105
00:06:21,111 --> 00:06:23,750
win votes and multiplied subsidies.

106
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:26,260
No,

107
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:27,093
in only 13 years,
public employment sought by 60% to give 

108
00:06:30,521 --> 00:06:32,710
you an idea of how extreme this was 
today,

109
00:06:32,780 --> 00:06:37,330
35% of employees in Argentina work for 
the government.

110
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,320
Hopefully they're gonna share this.
[inaudible],

111
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:49,670
[inaudible],
[inaudible],

112
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:55,370
[inaudible],
[inaudible], [inaudible]

113
00:06:57,171 --> 00:06:59,300
select libido basis or Rochelle.

114
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,530
Okay,

115
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:06,260
get this in seven provinces in the 
country,

116
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,080
there are more public workers,
then there are private.

117
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:09,973
It really is a crazy situation.
It's given that the government didn't 

118
00:07:21,101 --> 00:07:23,530
have enough money to pay for all of this
year after year,

119
00:07:23,531 --> 00:07:26,650
they continue to register a huge public 
deficits.

120
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,750
Now,
as you might know,

121
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:28,593
the coach and has couldn't go to the 
international markets first because 

122
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:32,344
they're investors didn't trust them in 
seconds because the country was already 

123
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:36,153
in the fall.

124
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:38,120
Okay.

125
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,631
He's wonderful.
He,

126
00:07:38,631 --> 00:07:39,464
Naomi Luna,
a [inaudible] [inaudible] 

127
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:49,923
[inaudible] [inaudible] 
[inaudible] [inaudible] 

128
00:07:54,750 --> 00:07:57,320
[inaudible] [inaudible] [inaudible]

129
00:07:57,700 --> 00:07:58,533
oh,
nice.

130
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:02,551
Nine.
Of course,

131
00:08:02,551 --> 00:08:03,384
if you don't pay your investors,
obviously the investors don't lend you 

132
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,500
any more money.
All right,

133
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,570
so what do you think they did then?
Yeah,

134
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,050
they used every populist politicians 
favorite machine,

135
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:13,913
the money printing machine.
They simply printed new pesos to pay 

136
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:21,681
that public expenditure vasant and 
establishing your currency camp,

137
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:23,533
which meant and limiting the amounts of 
money there's Argentinians could take 

138
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:27,830
out of the country.
So they wouldn't be,

139
00:08:27,831 --> 00:08:32,660
Thomas said dwindling reserves.
And the question is,

140
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,600
what happens when these policies 
continue?

141
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:36,770
Well,
inflation,

142
00:08:36,771 --> 00:08:37,604
the soul is due to all the new stays in 
circulation and foreign investors of 

143
00:08:40,581 --> 00:08:41,414
course do not want to come near you.
And so there was in these circumstances 

144
00:08:45,141 --> 00:08:47,360
that Mauricio Macri came to power

145
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:55,940
the mockery plants.

146
00:08:58,810 --> 00:09:01,540
Mauricio Macri came to the Castle 
Rosado.

147
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:02,403
He had a plan to implement reforms 
little by little that were commonly 

148
00:09:05,171 --> 00:09:06,700
known as gradualism,

149
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:11,890
but eight to implement [inaudible] 
economic [inaudible], [inaudible]

150
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:19,750
[inaudible],
[inaudible], [inaudible]

151
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,920
[inaudible],

152
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:23,510
and the truth is they've actually been 
quite successful.

153
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:24,373
The business climate has improved.
Some subsidies have been reduced and in 

154
00:09:27,471 --> 00:09:28,304
a way they regained the international 
investors trust out of all the hard 

155
00:09:36,981 --> 00:09:39,980
things they needed to do if they've only
done the easiest ones.

156
00:09:39,981 --> 00:09:40,814
What they haven't achieved in more than 
two years of governing has been 

157
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,260
decreasing the public deficits

158
00:09:45,610 --> 00:09:46,443
flushing

159
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,290
in spite of having access to the 
financial markets,

160
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,153
the options on government has continued 
to prince bills to maintain that public 

161
00:09:57,151 --> 00:09:59,970
expenditure out of course means more 
inflation.

162
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,220
This chart shows how the money is 
growing.

163
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,420
That is how the Central Bank of the 
Republic of Argentina continues to issue

164
00:10:06,450 --> 00:10:11,450
more and more pesos.
Good.

165
00:10:20,931 --> 00:10:21,980
All right.
Now you might be wondering,

166
00:10:21,981 --> 00:10:22,814
well,
it wasn't Mauricio Macri that duty was 

167
00:10:23,661 --> 00:10:25,400
supposed to change things.
Well,

168
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,263
Gary was,
but slowly see this all has an 

169
00:10:28,521 --> 00:10:29,354
explanation.
Yeah.

170
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:32,143
Factories team's idea was to carry out 
reforms and little by little to attract 

171
00:10:34,671 --> 00:10:37,100
investments and make the Argentine 
economy grow.

172
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:37,963
If the economy grew,
the government would raise more money 

173
00:10:39,741 --> 00:10:44,741
and would not have to make cuts.
Meanwhile,

174
00:10:45,951 --> 00:10:46,784
little by little,
as they regains the international 

175
00:10:48,291 --> 00:10:49,124
markets trust,
they would be able to issue a debt and 

176
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:53,690
is thus reduce the need to print bills 
in this way.

177
00:10:53,691 --> 00:10:54,524
Within a few years,
Argentina would you got rid of that 

178
00:10:55,741 --> 00:10:56,574
deficits,
limit inflation and would start to grow 

179
00:10:58,551 --> 00:10:59,570
again.
It's an accurate,

180
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:03,440
of course would maintainers political 
capital to continue winning elections.

181
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:06,030
It all sounds like a pretty great plant 
rice.

182
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:06,864
Yeah.

183
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,453
Well,

184
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,960
so far things have actually kind of gone
his plans,

185
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:18,961
but just hold on a moment because things
have now changed and it's mainly for two

186
00:11:19,601 --> 00:11:22,910
reasons.
Fast.

187
00:11:22,911 --> 00:11:23,744
After two and a half years in power,
it's hard to understand how the public 

188
00:11:26,691 --> 00:11:27,524
deficits,
inflation and taxes continue to 

189
00:11:29,631 --> 00:11:30,464
skyrocket.
Gradualism how's it become something 

190
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,373
like racing and arthritic at all and 
seconds because the Federal Reserve of 

191
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:41,544
the United States has begun to raise 
interest rates C for public debt in the 

192
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:48,780
United States,
the 10 year bond is already yielding 3%

193
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,153
okay.

194
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,243
Out of course,
many investors now asked themselves if 

195
00:11:59,971 --> 00:12:00,804
the u s desk,
which is supposedly the less risky 

196
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:04,590
assets,
gives me a reasonable return.

197
00:12:04,680 --> 00:12:08,070
Why on earth would I keep lending money 
to Argentina?

198
00:12:08,130 --> 00:12:10,410
Wow,
I see no changes.

199
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:13,220
Yeah,

200
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,053
well that's exactly what it is because 
many people who were interested in 

201
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:18,740
investing in Argentina to turn away from
it,

202
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,450
and for this reason,
macaroons,

203
00:12:21,470 --> 00:12:25,310
governments has decided to resort to the
international monetary funds to obtain a

204
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,144
credit line with which to face the debt 
maturities of the upcoming months and 

205
00:12:29,361 --> 00:12:30,194
the future.
Can you remember what would happen if a 

206
00:12:34,151 --> 00:12:37,600
new default occurred before the 2019 
elections?

207
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:38,463
You see,
everything has to do with the 

208
00:12:39,941 --> 00:12:42,130
government's behaviour and if you think 
about it for a moment,

209
00:12:42,131 --> 00:12:45,250
it's actually very sensible.
The patients once held for Argentina,

210
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,130
it's gone.
What investors and Argentine savers find

211
00:12:48,131 --> 00:12:48,964
themselves saying is fine.
If you want to spend more than you can 

212
00:12:51,280 --> 00:12:53,910
go right ahead,
but just don't do it with my money.

213
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,453
Yeah,

214
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:01,310
and this is north of me in regards of 
public spending,

215
00:13:01,311 --> 00:13:04,310
but many other reforms that make it 
easier to do business.

216
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:06,380
And this,
it brings up a key question.

217
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:11,440
Is it time to abandon gradualism 
aggressive therapies or gradualism

218
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:21,070
nope.

219
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:23,560
Flakes making reforms is never an easy 
task,

220
00:13:23,561 --> 00:13:27,130
but I think it's time for the castle 
Rosado that's the Argentinian version of

221
00:13:27,131 --> 00:13:29,680
the White House to osc itself.
A question shouldn't leave.

222
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,500
Perhaps try employing more aggressive 
measures.

223
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:33,311
Well,
you know what?

224
00:13:33,311 --> 00:13:35,770
First let's take a look at the 
historical evidence.

225
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:36,633
Which do you think has worked better?
Gradualism a con step by step change or 

226
00:13:40,421 --> 00:13:41,350
aggressive therapy?

227
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:42,263
Hey,

228
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:44,203
we can see a good example of huge 
transformations in the former countries 

229
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:47,803
of the Soviet orbit.
When the communist model collapsed in 

230
00:13:49,431 --> 00:13:54,230
1989 many countries employed drastic 
changes almost overnight while others,

231
00:13:54,231 --> 00:13:55,990
obs,
there's four more gradual measures.

232
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:59,950
Now's the best results.
It was the ones that made the most

233
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,793
good

234
00:14:06,760 --> 00:14:07,560
trees,
assumptions,

235
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,680
Estonia,
Latvia,

236
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:09,880
Lithuania,
Poland,

237
00:14:09,881 --> 00:14:10,714
and the Czech Republic opposite for a 
more drastic change that is making 

238
00:14:14,201 --> 00:14:19,201
reforms as quickly as possible.
Yeah,

239
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:21,003
it was pretty hot at the beginning,
but soon they began to grow and they 

240
00:14:23,171 --> 00:14:24,004
achieved all kinds of investments to 
such an extent that today these 

241
00:14:27,041 --> 00:14:27,874
countries which were mostly poor in 1989
have a higher standard of living than 

242
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:36,511
Portugal or any Latin American country.
On the other hand is though you see what

243
00:14:38,401 --> 00:14:41,160
plying gradual reforms,
countries such as Ukraine,

244
00:14:41,161 --> 00:14:42,450
Romania,
Tajikistan,

245
00:14:42,451 --> 00:14:43,320
ends,
Armenia,

246
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,213
well,
let's just say things haven't gone so 

247
00:14:45,901 --> 00:14:50,901
well either an economic or social tams.
Anyway,

248
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:53,234
if I x,
this is a decision that macri is 

249
00:14:54,331 --> 00:14:55,164
government has to make.
It has to decide whether to take 

250
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:57,824
advantage of the IMF,
some money to carry out strong reforms 

251
00:14:59,990 --> 00:15:03,260
once and for all or continue with grand 
jury will listen it and let's be clear.

252
00:15:03,290 --> 00:15:07,130
If Argentina doesn't fix its public debt
and stopped printing bills,

253
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,530
the future does not look good.

254
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,333
Borrowing money is in good governance.
Good governance is creating basic 

255
00:15:13,961 --> 00:15:15,550
reforms.
In Argentina.

256
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:16,413
There's an elephant Tine,
gigantic hypertrophied state that needs 

257
00:15:20,531 --> 00:15:24,160
to be slimmed down.
They need to cut public spending.

258
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,120
Jame Bailey,

259
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:27,700
in addition,
the model simply doesn't work.

260
00:15:27,701 --> 00:15:30,730
The Argentine government has never spent
so much,

261
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,593
and despite that it's been decades since
there was so much poverty and so much 

262
00:15:35,081 --> 00:15:38,920
violence.
But we'll mastery listener.

263
00:15:38,950 --> 00:15:40,210
Well,
I need the future will tell,

264
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:41,860
but now it's your turn.
What do you think?

265
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,753
Should they continue with the gradual 
reforms or is it time for a faster 

266
00:15:45,941 --> 00:15:46,774
change while leave your answer in the 
comments below as well as in this
