1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,320
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,343
Chechnya is an island of Islamic 
fanaticism in the middle of Vladimir 

3
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:13,810
Putin's Russia.
Yup.

4
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:14,644
You had that rights when it comes to me,
that congratulates itself on being the 

5
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:19,510
spiritual shelter of the West.
The laws,

6
00:00:19,511 --> 00:00:20,920
the bullock of Christiana.
See,

7
00:00:21,130 --> 00:00:24,020
this is a country where you can find the
republic of Chechnya.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:26,870
It's a positive Russia where it is 
impossible to buy him.

9
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:28,023
Cut.

10
00:00:30,680 --> 00:00:32,720
Oh yes.
Was I know what you're going to see.

11
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:33,563
I'm waiting an assignment that didn't 
you just say the republic of Chechnya 

12
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:38,390
didn't say that it was a part of Russia?
Well,

13
00:00:38,391 --> 00:00:40,970
the truth is the Russian Federation is 
territory wise,

14
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:41,804
the biggest country in the world,
and that means that their political 

15
00:00:44,151 --> 00:00:46,400
distribution,
it's really complicated.

16
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,383
The biggest parts of the country is 
divided into the so called oblasts 

17
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:50,563
switch up.
Similar to the states in the United 

18
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:53,751
States of America.
These areas,

19
00:00:53,751 --> 00:00:55,670
they have their own governor.
They have their own parliaments,

20
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:59,480
but they must respect the Russian 
constitution as well as the Kremlin.

21
00:00:59,570 --> 00:01:01,670
However,
there are other regions in Russia,

22
00:01:01,671 --> 00:01:05,180
the so called republics that have way 
more autonomy.

23
00:01:05,210 --> 00:01:06,043
They have their own constitution.
They have their own language and they 

24
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:08,474
could even have that own official.
One of these republics is the Crimean 

25
00:01:16,321 --> 00:01:20,190
republic and despite not being 
recognized by America or by Europe,

26
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,220
it is controlled by Russia.
You've seen in theory,

27
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,800
Russian law guarantees a lot of autonomy
bots.

28
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,190
I say in theory like that because as you
know,

29
00:01:29,191 --> 00:01:33,270
Vladimir Putin loves to keep this 
country under tight control.

30
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:34,173
In fact,
almost all of the presidents of the 

31
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:40,050
republics belonged to Putin's political 
party and that would be united Russia.

32
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:42,240
Anytime one of those governors 
challenges Putin,

33
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:45,060
even just the little things like this 
happen

34
00:01:47,530 --> 00:01:51,460
Tatarstan the last region to lose its 
special status under Putin.

35
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:52,563
Nonetheless,
there is a real public that Putin does 

36
00:01:54,221 --> 00:01:55,520
not dare to bully.
Yup.

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:56,880
You had that ride.
Vladimir Putin,

38
00:01:56,890 --> 00:01:57,723
the Chuck Norris of politics is afraid 
sometimes to specifically when it comes 

39
00:02:02,591 --> 00:02:03,430
to Chechnya,

40
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:05,170
is

41
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,003
often unclear who rules whom.
Russian observers of the region 

42
00:02:08,861 --> 00:02:12,460
complained that Russian law and 
authority stops at the Chechnyan border.

43
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:20,490
For example,
in Chechnya,

44
00:02:20,491 --> 00:02:21,324
the hijab is promoted by the government.
Things like polygamy and even marriages 

45
00:02:24,931 --> 00:02:29,010
involving minors that are actually 
tolerated and no restaurant.

46
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,400
Dez to open a daytime during Ramadan 
season.

47
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,960
Nonetheless,
all of these things,

48
00:02:33,990 --> 00:02:34,823
I'm nothing compared to what some 
newspapers showed in April of 2017 

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,930
Chechnya opens worlds first 
concentration camp for homosexuals.

50
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:47,470
Yeah,
yeah.

51
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:48,303
Listen,
I know he picked it is not exactly the 

52
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:50,344
biggest fan of lgbt rights,
but opening a gay concentration camp 

53
00:02:53,630 --> 00:02:54,463
sounds like it it too much even for him.
So the question to be made here is why 

54
00:02:59,120 --> 00:02:59,953
doesn't put some order into Chechnya?
What is the church and President Rams 

55
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:07,960
and off secret to getting Putin that's 
and let him do as he pleases.

56
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,450
Well today we are going to answer all of
those questions,

57
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:13,570
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the history.

58
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:14,463
Great.

59
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:22,130
The Sicily of the Caucasus for centuries
Czechian yet was ruled by big clams that

60
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:23,484
have power over specific areas.
Those clams named took home in the 

61
00:03:26,821 --> 00:03:30,300
church in language we're composed of 
hundreds of smaller families.

62
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:33,060
The so called tip or a better 
understanding.

63
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:36,150
This was pretty similar to the Sicilian 
mafia system.

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:37,133
Everything stayed in the file.
Everything was done according to the 

65
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:45,070
principles of religion.
In this case,

66
00:03:45,100 --> 00:03:46,990
Sunni Islam,
I'm the same way.

67
00:03:46,991 --> 00:03:49,870
The Sicilian mafia resisted all kinds of
invasions.

68
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:50,763
The Chechen took him system that 
survived the saws and even the Soviet 

69
00:03:54,550 --> 00:03:55,383
Union.

70
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:57,080
Yeah,

71
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:57,913
it must be Soviets in public and Muslims
in private Chechnyan proverb and other 

72
00:04:01,321 --> 00:04:02,154
words during the Soviet era that were 
two parallel systems that were running 

73
00:04:05,491 --> 00:04:08,100
at the same time,
all of a surface that was communism,

74
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,810
but under grounds there was a hierarchy 
of Muslim clams and families.

75
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:16,770
This is why in the year 1991 when the 
Soviet Union disappeared,

76
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:17,753
Chechens seize the opportunity and 
declared the Chechen Republic of a 

77
00:04:21,061 --> 00:04:21,920
carrier.
This,

78
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:22,754
and I might ring a bell with you because
it appears in one of the call of duty 

79
00:04:24,831 --> 00:04:29,831
video games.
Now back then,

80
00:04:31,051 --> 00:04:33,210
the presidents of the brand new Russian 
Federation,

81
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,073
that was Boris Yeltsin,
and he replied to those rebels with 

82
00:04:37,171 --> 00:04:38,004
military Yeltsin,
declares emergency curfew and Chechen 

83
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,530
region.
Nevertheless,

84
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,423
this state of emergency fails entirely.
The Russian army was incapable of 

85
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:52,660
stopping the chapter and rentals and 
they have to run back home.

86
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,090
But not only that,
during their retreats,

87
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:58,270
these separatist rebels seized Russian 
weapons.

88
00:04:58,420 --> 00:05:01,690
So for three long years,
the Kremlin puts up with Chechnya.

89
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:05,950
But in the year 1994 well,
things they changed.

90
00:05:09,980 --> 00:05:10,770
Okay,

91
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:14,190
you can build a throne with band nets,
but it's difficult to sit on it,

92
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:15,473
Boris Yeltsin.
But do you remember what I told you 

93
00:05:16,321 --> 00:05:17,154
about the political system of Chechnya,
which was based on the took him clan 

94
00:05:19,381 --> 00:05:20,370
system?
Well,

95
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,360
the truth is these different clans 
didn't really get on very well with each

96
00:05:24,361 --> 00:05:27,060
other,
and this was the start of a civil war,

97
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:29,250
a civil war.
That's to rush eyes.

98
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:32,490
Where's the perfect opportunity to take 
back control of the republic?

99
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:33,690
However,
a year later,

100
00:05:33,691 --> 00:05:34,524
the Russian army had lost 6,000 soldiers
and poor Boris Yeltsin had to sign a 

101
00:05:37,411 --> 00:05:41,360
peace treaty with the separatists ends.
Pretty weak governments of Chechnya.

102
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:42,263
Meanwhile,
many Islamic terrorists from Saudi 

103
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,783
Arabia and Afghanistan fled to Grozny.
The Chechen capitol to recruit new 

104
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:48,804
members are failed states with a tribal 
system where Islam is the official 

105
00:05:51,871 --> 00:05:52,704
religion.
That sounds like a pretty great market 

106
00:05:53,911 --> 00:05:55,230
for recruiting terrorists.

107
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,210
Well,
in other words,

108
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,170
all of this meant that it was just a 
matter of time before another war again.

109
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:08,273
So this war,
it started in 1999 when a group of 

110
00:06:10,501 --> 00:06:13,590
Islamic rebels invaded a neighboring 
Russian republic,

111
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,573
the Republic of Dagestan.
So if making trouble in their own 

112
00:06:17,221 --> 00:06:21,390
territory wasn't enough Chechens wanting
to attack other parts of Russia.

113
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,850
Now,
as you might imagine from this,

114
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:26,580
the Kremlin decided to send the troops 
immediately,

115
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:30,210
but this time it was pretty different.
So why was this?

116
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,073
Well,
despite the fact Boris Yeltsin was the 

117
00:06:32,161 --> 00:06:32,994
president this time,
the prime minister was the one and only 

118
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:38,830
the hero of visual politic.
And that would be Vladimir Putin.

119
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:39,664
Yeah.

120
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,201
Well,
Putin,

121
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,420
he actually,
when's their rents?

122
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:47,670
He found one of the separatists chiefs.
And that would be Ms. Dot.

123
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:48,543
[inaudible] cut a Rov.
So basically piecing when's this cutter 

124
00:06:50,781 --> 00:06:52,170
off guy and said,
all right dude,

125
00:06:52,230 --> 00:06:54,090
look,
I'm going to show you a gold.

126
00:06:54,091 --> 00:06:57,030
I'm going to give me as many weapons and
as much power as you need.

127
00:06:57,210 --> 00:06:59,310
You could do whatever you want there in 
Chechnya,

128
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:02,310
but that is only one condition.
No wars,

129
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,070
no terrorism.
All right.

130
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:07,110
And as we say here at visual policy egg 
as it was sad,

131
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:09,060
well still it was done.
The wall,

132
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,210
it was over and catterall views all that
help from the Kremlin.

133
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,480
Do you destroy it?
The other warlords in the report,

134
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:21,380
and now you might be wondering,
well,

135
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:24,620
did all of this work really answer says 
yes.

136
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:28,700
I'm sort of all say no.
Of course there were no more wars,

137
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:29,563
but many of those other warlords started
organizing terrorist attacks in other 

138
00:07:32,841 --> 00:07:35,300
areas of Russia,
including Moscow.

139
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,193
In the Moscow case,
a terrorist group kidnaps over 300 

140
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,050
hostages in a theater.
Of those 300 civilians,

141
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:44,810
170 died.
In other words,

142
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,673
Putin's plan was far from perfect and 
Kevin Authority was not taken for 

143
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:50,750
granted.
In fact,

144
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,710
some years later he would die in another
terrorist attack in Grozny Allen's.

145
00:07:54,711 --> 00:07:55,544
Well,
that was the moment when the main 

146
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,500
character in all of this story comes 
into the picture.

147
00:08:05,830 --> 00:08:09,010
Instagram star runs out and catterall 
succeeded.

148
00:08:09,011 --> 00:08:12,310
His Father Empower Nan's.
He learned a valuable lesson.

149
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,270
If you want to start a dictatorship,
you better make it big.

150
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,300
We all talking about a country full of 
warlords fighting each other.

151
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:20,134
Where al You doing one dash are 
recruiting people who might challenge 

152
00:08:23,050 --> 00:08:24,430
cataracts power.
In other words,

153
00:08:24,431 --> 00:08:27,190
he was not willing to let those weird 
western fashions,

154
00:08:27,191 --> 00:08:28,024
you know,
like democracy or human rights make him 

155
00:08:29,561 --> 00:08:31,020
look weak.
Besides here,

156
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:32,530
pten support.
He had wealth.

157
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:35,040
He had weapons.
What marketing possibly ask

158
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:36,013
form.

159
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:41,410
I owe my life to preach him.
If I ever forget this,

160
00:08:41,411 --> 00:08:44,560
I am not a math.
When I went through a terribly hard time

161
00:08:44,561 --> 00:08:45,670
in my life,
he helped.

162
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:48,780
He has the most saintly to Ramazan

163
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,490
[inaudible].
The truth.

164
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:52,750
Truth

165
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:56,580
is since kind of rope came to power 
Chechen in other parts of Russia,

166
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:58,980
while they've disappeared,
but not only that,

167
00:08:59,120 --> 00:08:59,953
I'll,
how are you doing Dash Mila's in stuff 

168
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:03,510
disappearing to cater rob's police 
chases them.

169
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,040
Expels them from the country with their 
families and then bud's down the houses.

170
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:11,543
Yes,

171
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:13,880
this was not enough.
Cut Her off.

172
00:09:13,881 --> 00:09:14,714
Soldiers offer themselves as volunteers 
for the most dangerous missions in 

173
00:09:17,751 --> 00:09:18,890
Ukraine.
In fact,

174
00:09:18,891 --> 00:09:19,724
in order to show his love for Putin rams
and candor of organize the military 

175
00:09:22,101 --> 00:09:26,210
parade at Cross knee football stadium,
thousands of soldiers were waving at the

176
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:27,044
Chechen presidents ready to die for him.
If Putin tells me to get my army 

177
00:09:32,241 --> 00:09:33,410
together,
I'm ready.

178
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:36,240
[inaudible] rough bus things.
Well,

179
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:39,120
they are not as sweet as they might 
seem.

180
00:09:39,121 --> 00:09:42,690
Actually with that military parade cadre
off was given two messages.

181
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,040
One was,
Hey Putin,

182
00:09:44,070 --> 00:09:45,810
I'm your buddy,
but the other was,

183
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:47,880
hey Putin,
if you ever stopped being my buddy,

184
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:51,240
come and get me,
if you dare.

185
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,550
Yes,
DIV UA.

186
00:09:52,551 --> 00:09:56,120
If flattening a Putin ever wanted to 
confront his Chechen bestie,

187
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,620
it would be complicated to save the 
League

188
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:04,350
spent on many signs that this could 
actually happen.

189
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:05,320
In fact,
all of Kadar,

190
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:06,163
rob's political foes,
they've been murdered regardless of 

191
00:10:08,731 --> 00:10:09,564
where they work.
For journalists living in Moscow to 

192
00:10:11,761 --> 00:10:13,980
political opponents,
siding in some Petersburg,

193
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,650
they've all been kills like,
well,

194
00:10:15,651 --> 00:10:16,890
what does this mean?
What it means.

195
00:10:16,891 --> 00:10:21,891
The government of Grozny has its own kgb
situated all across the country and well

196
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:23,513
they're happy to use it anytime someone 
Chechen or not get seen little bits 

197
00:10:27,750 --> 00:10:28,583
bothersome so it puts it more poetically
well piecing created rams and cat are 

198
00:10:31,681 --> 00:10:35,580
off and now his creation has become big 
enough to look him in the eye.

199
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:40,113
This explains why I'm like other 
presidents of Russian republics kind of 

200
00:10:42,851 --> 00:10:43,684
relevant dares to give his opinion on 
international affairs and the creme and 

201
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,710
they pretended they don't see those 
horrific gay concentration camps.

202
00:10:52,790 --> 00:10:53,110
Russia

203
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:54,350
backs,
Chechnya governments,

204
00:10:54,351 --> 00:10:56,750
denials over killing a torture of gay 
men.

205
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:57,823
Meanwhile,
Chechnya is getting wealthier and 

206
00:10:59,421 --> 00:11:00,254
wealthier thanks to Russia.
90% of their wealth comes direct from 

207
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,500
money transfers from the Kremlin her 
off.

208
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,393
He's built a republic where the cause of
his personality is always like a second 

209
00:11:10,011 --> 00:11:10,844
religion.
Just surpassed by Islam is instagram 

210
00:11:12,981 --> 00:11:13,600
accounts,
by the way,

211
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,420
has over 3 million followers,
which is twice as many as the church and

212
00:11:17,421 --> 00:11:18,254
population.
And on this account you can see the 

213
00:11:20,421 --> 00:11:23,030
lifestyle of one of the craziest 
dictators around,

214
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,103
and at the same time,
the only one that makes pewter to 

215
00:11:26,061 --> 00:11:26,894
phrase.

216
00:11:34,220 --> 00:11:35,053
Now the question is,
will Vladimir Putin and ran Zahn 

217
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:37,674
catterall ends up clashing?
Should the Kremlin tried to stop the 

218
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:42,260
human rights violations in Chechnya?
Well,
