1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:10,930
Uruguay's the country famous for soccer.
As we celebrate Russia's,

2
00:00:10,931 --> 00:00:11,764
we'll see this summer we've checked the 
whole fame and there are only eight 

3
00:00:14,661 --> 00:00:17,030
countries that have ever want to final 
year grier,

4
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:17,983
really small country with a little more 
than 3 million inhabitants while there 

5
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:21,763
one of them,
they've even won the cup twice and in 

6
00:00:23,211 --> 00:00:26,600
both cases they beat their need as 
Brazil and Argentina.

7
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:27,493
Tina.

8
00:00:30,690 --> 00:00:31,523
So in today's video we're going to talk 
about how Uruguayan has beaten then 

9
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,700
neighbors,
but not in soccer,

10
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,310
but rather in economics.
Yes,

11
00:00:38,311 --> 00:00:39,144
alongside Chile.
Uruguay is the wealthiest country in 

12
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:42,144
America when it comes to GDP per capita,
but it's also one of the most stable 

13
00:00:45,661 --> 00:00:48,720
when it comes to politics and that has 
some of the best public services,

14
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,673
but there's even more to this story.
We can actually say that Uruguay is the 

15
00:00:52,621 --> 00:00:55,270
model for the entire South American left
wing.

16
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:58,270
Have you ever heard about their former 
presidents seem weaker?

17
00:00:58,410 --> 00:00:59,243
He's known as the world's poorest 
presidents and he quickly became the 

18
00:01:01,291 --> 00:01:04,080
ultimate leftwing or rockstar.
He's the only world leader.

19
00:01:04,230 --> 00:01:05,063
We refuse to live in the presidential 
palace and kept driving an old 

20
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:10,650
Volkswagen instead of an expensive 
official car.

21
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:14,423
From a life philosophy perspective,
I believe it's better to live little 

22
00:01:17,581 --> 00:01:20,100
luggage,
just the minimum necessary,

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,760
no material complexity.
If you have too much complexity,

24
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:26,430
you end up spending too much time.
Nevertheless,

25
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:28,530
while knew who kind of has this simple 
lifestyle,

26
00:01:28,531 --> 00:01:29,364
his country grew economically,
it's attracted foreign companies and it 

27
00:01:31,501 --> 00:01:32,334
became a pioneer with social rights with
me here as President Uruguay passed a 

28
00:01:35,851 --> 00:01:38,310
bill for the legalization of same sex 
marriage.

29
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:39,173
That's undoubtedly his most famous 
policy was the legalization of 

30
00:01:42,601 --> 00:01:46,800
recreational marijuana sales way before 
California or any other country.

31
00:01:46,810 --> 00:01:47,643
Uruguayan was the first country to 
legalize the sale and consumption of 

32
00:01:51,271 --> 00:01:54,060
wheat and the country's progress.
It doesn't stop them.

33
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,410
If you take a static picture of Uruguay,
you will see a country.

34
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:00,500
There's arguably is the best place to 
live in all of South America.

35
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:07,120
If you take a static picture of Uruguay,
you will see your country.

36
00:02:07,121 --> 00:02:10,990
There's arguably is the best place to 
live in all of South America.

37
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:11,883
Unlike Brazil and Argentina,
Uruguay is economy hasn't stopped 

38
00:02:14,681 --> 00:02:15,514
growing since 2000 and to have a 
thriving middle class since the highest 

39
00:02:18,791 --> 00:02:19,624
wages in the region along with Chile,
but hold on a minute because not 

40
00:02:22,391 --> 00:02:24,270
everything is a field of roses.
ROSACEA.

41
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,080
In fact,
as such a prosperous country,

42
00:02:26,081 --> 00:02:27,910
you might expect it to have plenty of 
immigrant.

43
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:29,130
Right?
Well,

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:31,350
the reality is actually ready 
difference,

45
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:33,690
and this is not because they have strong
immigration laws,

46
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,220
people just don't pick a Uruguayan as a 
country of residence because well,

47
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,800
things are actually starting to go 
rather sour.

48
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:41,663
They have around an 80 percent 
unemployment rates and that economic 

49
00:02:43,591 --> 00:02:45,390
growth speed is reducing.
Well.

50
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:46,343
Other countries like Peru and Chile 
seemed to offer opportunities for 

51
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:49,943
everyone.
So today's question is why has 

52
00:02:51,181 --> 00:02:54,030
Uruguayans economy worked out so well 
until now?

53
00:02:54,031 --> 00:02:54,864
Ones.
What are the current problems they're 

54
00:02:55,621 --> 00:02:56,311
facing?
Well,

55
00:02:56,311 --> 00:02:57,960
today we're going to answer all of those
questions,

56
00:02:57,961 --> 00:02:58,794
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the history 

57
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,330
America.
Switzerland.

58
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:09,080
Uruguayan was born in 1830 after a war 
between Brazil and Argentina,

59
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,330
the British words and negotiate the 
peace agreements,

60
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:14,480
and they badly wanted Uruguay required 
to be an independent country.

61
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:19,200
Sorry.

62
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:20,220
Why was this?
Well,

63
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,063
Montevideo is harbor was a jewel and 
they didn't want it ending up in 

64
00:03:23,521 --> 00:03:26,970
Brazilian or Argentinian enhance back 
then Uruguay.

65
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:27,863
It was almost uninhabited.
It was inhabited by a tribe called the 

66
00:03:30,101 --> 00:03:32,490
Cero [inaudible],
but they were soon exterminated.

67
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,383
This is why unlike many other South 
American countries and most of 

68
00:03:35,581 --> 00:03:36,414
Uruguayans have a European ethnicity,
mainly Spanish and Italian roots in 

69
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:40,884
those times,
if you are an ambitious boy looking for 

70
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:44,970
a career and an opportunity to make 
money,

71
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:45,863
Uruguay was the place to go.
It was better than America and it was 

72
00:03:48,511 --> 00:03:49,344
better than Australia.
It was a modern democracy with rule of 

73
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:52,580
law and a thriving.
Yeah.

74
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:53,433
Economy

75
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,390
until the sixties of the 20th century.
This country was among the wealthiest in

76
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,224
the world.
It was way richer than many European 

77
00:04:03,121 --> 00:04:04,110
nations.
In fact.

78
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:05,250
So now you might be wondering,
well,

79
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,113
what exactly happens?
Because despite being prosperous among 

80
00:04:08,371 --> 00:04:12,540
South American nations,
Uruguay is still way behind any European

81
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:14,220
country,
let alone America.

82
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,000
So what happens to make them stop 
growing so dramatically?

83
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,640
Well,
the answer lies in the whole things.

84
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:22,140
The European Union.
Yep.

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:23,890
You heard me right?
Devita.

86
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:28,500
If you thought this idea of a trade war 
was donald trump's invention on the very

87
00:04:28,501 --> 00:04:29,334
mistaken in the year 1958,
the European single market was created 

88
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,490
and one of the first things they did was
to protect their agriculture from

89
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:38,013
neat

90
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:43,450
meant that rule quite lost their biggest
customer.

91
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,120
The United States didn't want to trade 
with them either.

92
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,013
It was in the middle of the Cold War and
they were too busy dealing with bigger 

93
00:04:49,631 --> 00:04:52,270
problems than this little country to pay
attention.

94
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:57,340
So Day by day Uruguayan became stagnant 
and it's the government's in Montevideo,

95
00:04:57,341 --> 00:04:58,174
the country's capital.
They didn't have any other alternative 

96
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,920
than to look to their neighbors.
Argentina,

97
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:03,813
all of a sudden,
Uruguay and Argentina became something 

98
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:09,130
like the Robert Rodriguez and Quintin 
Tarantino of South America.

99
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:12,320
Argentina had a financial crisis,
so did Uruguay.

100
00:05:12,321 --> 00:05:14,470
If Argentina had a military 
dictatorship,

101
00:05:14,471 --> 00:05:17,110
well suited Uruguay,
Argentina had a democracy.

102
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,250
Well,
yes,

103
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:19,203
so data Uruguay.
So Dev you are well what happens in 

104
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:25,270
Argentina in the year 2002?
Well,

105
00:05:25,271 --> 00:05:29,230
they have the biggest financial crisis 
in all of history.

106
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:32,860
The now in famous Carlita ends in the 
very same year.

107
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:35,560
Uruguayans GDP fell by seven point seven
percent,

108
00:05:35,561 --> 00:05:37,510
which was a big time catastrophe.

109
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,380
And this was when I realized they had to
find new trade partners,

110
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,840
but how would they do that?
Well,

111
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:48,793
let's look into it.
Zero kilometer of South America during 

112
00:05:53,781 --> 00:05:54,614
the 19 eighties,
Uruguayan returns to democracy and the 

113
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:59,150
government did something really,
really interesting.

114
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,840
They created the so called Zonis 
frankness.

115
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,750
These were special territory's inside of
the country where companies were free to

116
00:06:05,751 --> 00:06:07,940
not pay taxes,
no VAT,

117
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:09,500
no income tax,
no corporate tax.

118
00:06:09,590 --> 00:06:13,790
The only request was that 75 percent of 
the jobs that are given to locals.

119
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,833
Maybe this reminds you of something 
because it's pretty much the same idea 

120
00:06:16,671 --> 00:06:17,504
as the special economic zones that exist
in China that we liked so much here at 

121
00:06:20,331 --> 00:06:21,070
visual Polish,

122
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,903
sick

123
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:25,620
or acquire has 11 tax freeze,

124
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:31,960
the three d

125
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:33,003
different kinds.
First we have those oriented to 

126
00:06:35,020 --> 00:06:35,853
logistics and international trade.
After that we have the zones that are 

127
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:39,004
designed for attracting multinational 
corporations that can use them as the 

128
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:46,891
headquarters for the South American.
Finally,

129
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:49,054
we have the areas that are meant to have
high tech industry and this is why or 

130
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:52,873
requires a regional leader and things 
such as pharmaceutical research and 

131
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:56,660
software,

132
00:06:56,660 --> 00:06:57,493
but this is not the end of the story.
These tax free zones have a unique 

133
00:07:00,651 --> 00:07:03,620
advantage.
Something that makes Uruguay a model for

134
00:07:03,621 --> 00:07:04,940
other countries.
Yes,

135
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:08,720
if you are here,
we're talking about political stability.

136
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:09,643
In the year 2005 Uruguayan changed its 
government leadership and they had lost 

137
00:07:13,631 --> 00:07:18,110
a left wing presidents that would be to 
bad Vasquez from the open friends party.

138
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,270
You see in most South American 
countries,

139
00:07:20,271 --> 00:07:21,104
having such an ideological shift in the 
government means that most of the work 

140
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:27,590
made by the previous administrations,
something goes into the trash.

141
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:32,950
Okay,

142
00:07:32,950 --> 00:07:35,890
so you might think that under a brand 
new left wing government,

143
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:39,220
those tax resigns would no longer exist.
Rice.

144
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,360
Well,
the reality,

145
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,253
it actually couldn't be more different.
And this is the great thing about this 

146
00:07:44,471 --> 00:07:47,440
country,
the bipartisan consensus.

147
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:48,333
This is why between 2005 and 2014,
the accumulated investment in these tax 

148
00:07:52,571 --> 00:07:53,404
free zones rose to almost $6,000,000,000
and all of this happens while first 

149
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:00,490
Vasquez and then Jose Mojica managed the
country.

150
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:06,250
She will keep them here for not looking 
only for profit.

151
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:09,790
They also want safety and this is what 
roadway has to offer.

152
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:12,130
It's not a matter of this or the other 
government.

153
00:08:12,131 --> 00:08:17,131
He is a genuine attitudinal neck.
The emily one's a well,

154
00:08:18,701 --> 00:08:21,790
what does Uruguayan get from these tax 
free zones?

155
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:24,100
Well,
that is a double benefits of them.

156
00:08:24,101 --> 00:08:25,360
Actually.
On the one hand,

157
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,263
they are able to appeal to industries 
that otherwise would have set up in 

158
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:33,160
other countries with bigger markets and 
these foreign companies need providers.

159
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:34,023
This is why sooner than expected,
many small enterprises are created 

160
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:37,983
around the country and of course they 
require highly skilled labor and that 

161
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:42,064
means good salaries.
This is why Uruguayans do need to 

162
00:08:44,231 --> 00:08:46,330
emigrate in order to find a good one

163
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:51,460
job.
The

164
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:52,633
of the moments here,
because we said that Uruguayan needs to 

165
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:56,240
change trade partners,
right?

166
00:08:56,370 --> 00:08:57,203
Maybe you remember how we said that they
could no longer depends on Argentina or 

167
00:08:59,941 --> 00:09:02,460
Brazil for their exports,
so you might not be wondering,

168
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:03,294
well,
what did the tax free zones have to do 

169
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,360
with all of this?
Well,

170
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,253
just think about it.
Thanks to these innovative industries 

171
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:09,923
that set up in the country.
Uruguayan could stop relying on the 

172
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:16,220
commodity of sex prior to this.
Their economy was based mainly on it and

173
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,063
don't meet today.
They create products that have more 

174
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,633
value added.

175
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:26,343
Giving you an example.
All of the Syrup and he did in Pepsi 

176
00:09:28,061 --> 00:09:32,050
drinks sold across all of South America 
is created in Uruguay.

177
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:32,943
In fact,
there's a particular type of Pepsi in 

178
00:09:33,851 --> 00:09:34,684
Japan called Pepsi Zukie.
This is made with a plant called sweet 

179
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:38,470
theme,
and again,

180
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:43,060
the Sarah for this beverage is produced 
a 200 kilometers away from Montevideo in

181
00:09:43,061 --> 00:09:43,894
total.
Pepsi represents seven percent of 

182
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,620
everything.
The country exports,

183
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:50,890
and this is not the only example,
one of the biggest papermaking companies

184
00:09:50,891 --> 00:09:51,724
on the planet,
a Finnish company called UPM has one of 

185
00:09:54,281 --> 00:09:55,114
them main factories in Uruguay and 
they've already announced the 

186
00:09:57,821 --> 00:09:58,654
construction of a brand new facility 
that might represent a whole two point 

187
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:05,320
five percent extra GDP for the country,
and if that isn't enough,

188
00:10:05,321 --> 00:10:07,780
Uruguay is also a software leader

189
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:16,780
or acquiring software developers among 
the best in all of Latin America.

190
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,643
In summary,
30 percent of Uruguay's exports are 

191
00:10:19,541 --> 00:10:22,720
produced from these tax free zones,
and yes,

192
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:24,080
here's the main buyer here.
Well,

193
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:27,610
let me give you a clue.
It starts with a C and h and I,

194
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:28,444
and it ends in an A.
Nowadays Brazil and Argentina received 

195
00:10:31,591 --> 00:10:34,390
just 20 percent of this country's 
exports.

196
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:36,460
I don't think a friend of your required 
is the Netherlands.

197
00:10:36,461 --> 00:10:37,294
The Rotterdam harder is the gateway to 
Europe as many of the Uruguayan exports 

198
00:10:40,721 --> 00:10:43,360
go that way to make a comparison.
Chili's economy,

199
00:10:43,361 --> 00:10:45,310
despite being the wealthiest in the 
region,

200
00:10:45,311 --> 00:10:47,560
is heavily reliant on that copper 
mining,

201
00:10:47,740 --> 00:10:51,280
half of their exports of this commodity 
alone Uruguay.

202
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:53,530
Instead,
it's got a diversified economy.

203
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:55,780
We've talked about software,
paper drinks,

204
00:10:55,810 --> 00:10:56,643
and of course cy and nice,
but if you thought of everything is all 

205
00:10:58,921 --> 00:11:01,350
sunshine and rainbows and hold on a 
second,

206
00:11:01,351 --> 00:11:05,070
it's because things are not quite as 
perfect as you might think.

207
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,850
Party versus government,
as we said before,

208
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,990
since the year 2005 Uruguay has had a 
left wing governments,

209
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:17,883
more specifically,
this country has been managed by the 

210
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:23,710
Open Front Party and one thing is 
certainly true.

211
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:24,573
They are worthy of that name because it 
is really an open policy with plenty of 

212
00:11:28,511 --> 00:11:31,930
different ideologies inside.
This is why despite what it looks like,

213
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:34,270
arguments a pretty common thing in the 
potty.

214
00:11:37,450 --> 00:11:39,490
So on the one hand,
despite the different presidents,

215
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:43,180
why hasn't the same finance minister for
the last 30 years?

216
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,073
His name is denny Louis' story and you 
could say that he's one of the 

217
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,450
architects of this Uruguayans too,

218
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:54,010
but on the other is the open front

219
00:11:54,010 --> 00:11:54,843
is really a battle fronts between the 
radical wing as the moderate wing 

220
00:11:58,151 --> 00:12:02,320
champions by two that Vasquez hosting me
because the left wing Rockstar,

221
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,154
he's somewhere in the middle and this is
why anytime Uruguayan government wants 

222
00:12:06,071 --> 00:12:08,440
to sign a free trade deal with any other
country,

223
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,110
they must face that own party 
opposition.

224
00:12:11,290 --> 00:12:14,770
It happens during the first Vasquez 
administration when they tried to sign a

225
00:12:14,771 --> 00:12:15,604
deal with the United States.
It happens when they tried to sign a 

226
00:12:17,771 --> 00:12:21,970
deal with Chili and it might not happen 
as they want to sign a deal with China.

227
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:23,440
In Atlanta,
Emilia,

228
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:25,483
2018,
we will mark the 30 years of diplomatic 

229
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:32,781
relations with China and this is why we 
have put this date as a deadline to sign

230
00:12:32,941 --> 00:12:33,960
a free trade deal.

231
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,400
In this case,
Uruguayan companies would save more than

232
00:12:36,401 --> 00:12:39,010
$100,000,000
in needless tariffs,

233
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,873
but this radical wing of the open front 
seems to be allergic to the word free 

234
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:45,790
trade,
and if this was not enough,

235
00:12:45,791 --> 00:12:50,460
some critics claim that Daniella a story
the finance minister spends to missile.

236
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,293
Yeah,

237
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:57,730
this is actually one of the biggest 
problems in IRC required after Venezuela

238
00:12:57,731 --> 00:12:58,564
and Argentina,
Uruguay has the largest share of civil 

239
00:13:01,331 --> 00:13:02,164
servants in the region.
One out of five workers is employed by 

240
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:05,944
the government,
and if you add to this the enormous 

241
00:13:07,331 --> 00:13:08,164
presence of an illegal economy,
you'll understand why just one third of 

242
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:15,580
adults work for private companies in 
most developed nations,

243
00:13:15,581 --> 00:13:16,720
this number is more than half.

244
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:24,330
Of course,
compared with Argentina or Brazil.

245
00:13:24,331 --> 00:13:25,164
Uruguay is a paradise on earth,
but the truth is if they wanted to keep 

246
00:13:28,381 --> 00:13:29,214
growing,
they must solve these problems as soon 

247
00:13:31,231 --> 00:13:32,064
as possible.

248
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:35,960
Sorry.

249
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,983
Now the final question is,
do you think Uruguay should sign those 

250
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:42,780
free trade deals?
Do you think it is still worth investing

251
00:13:42,781 --> 00:13:43,890
in as a country?
