1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:09,453
in this video,
we are going to take a look at the 

3
00:00:10,901 --> 00:00:15,070
career of one of the most surprising and
controversial figures of the century.

4
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:20,130
The figure is Mikhail Saakashvili.
Wait a second,

5
00:00:32,900 --> 00:00:34,100
you don't know him.
Well,

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:38,480
imagine a person who is capable of being
one of the best allies of Washington and

7
00:00:38,481 --> 00:00:42,350
at the same time one of the greatest 
enemies of flatten map Putin.

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,243
He was president of one country,
a candidate to preside over another and 

9
00:00:46,421 --> 00:00:48,650
today beat doesn't even have a 
nationality.

10
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:49,513
This is a man how politician worthy of 
starring and his very own political 

11
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:57,510
thriller.
In fact,

12
00:00:57,511 --> 00:00:58,344
I would imagine they probably wouldn't 
be surprising to see a netflix original 

13
00:01:00,391 --> 00:01:01,530
produced about this guy

14
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:08,540
[inaudible].

15
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:11,840
This is today's character for visual 
politic.

16
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,740
It is Mikhail Saakashvili.

17
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:15,203
Maybe a

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:23,650
be shoved the governor.
What does it start our story?

19
00:01:23,651 --> 00:01:28,651
We need to go back to maybe the 30th 
2015 but that's a petro Poroshenko.

20
00:01:28,751 --> 00:01:29,584
The president of Ukraine appointed may 
coming Elsa Cash Villi as the governor 

21
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,150
of the province of a Dessa.

22
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,410
With it

23
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:39,040
position Misha was given Ukrainian 
nationality.

24
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:40,960
However,
to becoming Ukrainian citizen,

25
00:01:40,961 --> 00:01:43,630
he had to give up citizenship from his 
home country,

26
00:01:43,631 --> 00:01:44,464
Georgia,
the country he had led US president 

27
00:01:45,641 --> 00:01:48,310
between 2004 and 2013

28
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:50,743
yes.

29
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:55,570
Addition to the Ukrainian government was
quite the treat for the media band.

30
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:57,130
Well,
that's only logical.

31
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:57,993
You see at that time your crane was 
going through a really tense situation 

32
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,980
after the circled maidan revolution and 
the fall of pro Russian President Viktor

33
00:02:05,980 --> 00:02:06,813
Yanukovych.
That was almost a feeling of civil war 

34
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:08,674
in Ukraine,
a war between Kiev supporters and 

35
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:11,173
supporters of Moscow,
and Odessa was one of the most pro 

36
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,434
Russian provinces.
So you can imagine the picture of the 

37
00:02:16,511 --> 00:02:18,850
foreign ex presidents and not just any 
ex president,

38
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:22,300
but what of Putin's worst enemies 
appointed as the governor of a,

39
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,403
this event was hugely discussed in all 
the national media as well as the 

40
00:02:26,831 --> 00:02:29,050
international press,
the president of Ukraine,

41
00:02:29,051 --> 00:02:30,010
who was,
by the way,

42
00:02:30,011 --> 00:02:32,860
in old friends and fellow college 
students of meshes,

43
00:02:32,861 --> 00:02:33,694
Petro Poroshenko.
Describe to Misha as the man who makes 

44
00:02:36,671 --> 00:02:38,920
possible the impossible,
pretty flattering,

45
00:02:38,921 --> 00:02:39,754
right at that time,
their friendship when it seemed 

46
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,340
bulletproof.
Well,

47
00:02:42,341 --> 00:02:46,930
the mission of the new governor was to 
stabilize a dessa grounds power to Kiev,

48
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:47,793
chase corruption,
and sets the groundwork for the region 

49
00:02:49,751 --> 00:02:54,751
to prosper in order to carry it all out 
to make sure.

50
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:58,040
Brought in many of his former 
collaborators from Georgia.

51
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:02,860
He also hired many young professionals 
to be thought to be corruption free like

52
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,830
Yulia and Mary chef's got an activist 
who became famous here on Youtube.

53
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:09,280
But with the video,
I am a Ukrainian.

54
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:12,970
Misha also brought in some people from 
Putin's opposition in Russia,

55
00:03:13,030 --> 00:03:13,863
like the Russian activist,
Maria guider who was appointed vice 

56
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:17,370
governor.
No.

57
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,203
Yes.

58
00:03:19,070 --> 00:03:21,810
That was a lot to do and it had to be 
done fast,

59
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,520
so wow.
As it was sad.

60
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,560
So it was done.

61
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,560
One

62
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,040
See,
took the Odessa governorship.

63
00:03:32,070 --> 00:03:36,390
The new governor started a thorough 
investigation to find and punish corrupt

64
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:37,283
public workers.
He changed most of the high level 

65
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:42,450
positions in the public administration.
He's simplified the process for creating

66
00:03:42,451 --> 00:03:43,284
companies and introduced independent 
controls and even liberated public 

67
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:47,243
beaches that had been illegally occupied
so that once again Adesa citizens joy 

68
00:03:50,791 --> 00:03:51,624
them.
Hold on a second tier because Misha has 

69
00:03:53,761 --> 00:03:58,680
a strange work methodology and it is as 
effective as it is controversial.

70
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:01,420
If anything doesn't work properly and 
does corrupt,

71
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,273
he just dismantles it.
He fires all the workers and he sets it 

72
00:04:05,071 --> 00:04:05,904
up again.
He did the same during his time in 

73
00:04:07,291 --> 00:04:08,124
office in Georgia with the traffic 
police anti threatened to do it again 

74
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:13,890
with the Odessa port,
the largest commercial port in Ukraine,

75
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,920
well known for bribes and payments to 
customs officers.

76
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:20,400
You need to fire them all.
We have 130 new people.

77
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:21,263
They are young,
new and trained and the old ones are 

78
00:04:22,741 --> 00:04:23,574
hopeless.
He Calls Saakashvili in the end though 

79
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:26,373
here and you have to follow some of the 
customs officers so that the corruption 

80
00:04:28,291 --> 00:04:29,730
would stop.
Consider this.

81
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:33,840
A number of businessmen noted that 
bribes at the port really had stopped in

82
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:34,674
recent months,
mainly because people were scared of 

83
00:04:36,181 --> 00:04:37,014
becoming the next victim of one of 
soccer stability is public 

84
00:04:38,971 --> 00:04:41,820
anticorruption tirades rates.
Shawn Walker,

85
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,690
correspondent of the Guardian with all 
these changes and with the help of me,

86
00:04:45,691 --> 00:04:46,524
she has contacts.
ADESA started to receive help from the 

87
00:04:48,811 --> 00:04:51,240
USA and since we should didn't trust the
police,

88
00:04:51,241 --> 00:04:52,074
the first thing he did was establish an 
independent police force to fight 

89
00:04:54,691 --> 00:04:55,524
corruption.

90
00:04:57,160 --> 00:04:57,993
One

91
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,863
has a police force that was organized 
and trained by the FBI and the 

92
00:05:01,841 --> 00:05:02,674
California Highway Patrol,
so it looks like everything was going 

93
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:06,670
pretty good.
Right.

94
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:11,440
Well just hold on a second because both 
sac is really and his team soon realized

95
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,620
that it was going to be much,
much harder than they anticipated.

96
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:15,483
The problem was that Odessa was not a 
battlefield of Kiev supporters versus 

97
00:05:18,941 --> 00:05:19,774
pro Russians,
but it was a battlefield between the 

98
00:05:21,311 --> 00:05:24,760
rule of law and an oligarchy that has 
dominated Ukraine at,

99
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,780
since it's independence kingdom of all 
the guards,

100
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:38,903
more and more experts have said,
so your cranes biggest problem is not a 

101
00:05:41,861 --> 00:05:42,694
Russia.
It is the oligarchy corruption in 

102
00:05:44,581 --> 00:05:45,414
Ukraine is so embedded that we could 
almost say it is a sort of feudal 

103
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:52,180
country where the nobility or of course 
these mighty oligarchy

104
00:05:54,830 --> 00:05:56,150
thanks.
They

105
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,490
control the,
the political power,

106
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:00,440
the administration,
even the media,

107
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:01,333
almost nothing escapes that power which 
is consolidated both by money and by 

108
00:06:05,481 --> 00:06:06,314
fear.
Then level of impunity is almost 

109
00:06:07,911 --> 00:06:10,970
absolute police,
government judges that all a part of the

110
00:06:10,971 --> 00:06:11,804
game.
Things have been this way since you 

111
00:06:12,851 --> 00:06:15,710
crane got its independence,
but since the maidan revolution,

112
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:16,573
it's all got a whole lot worse after the
fall of the pro Russian president vixy 

113
00:06:21,891 --> 00:06:22,724
you knock a bitch and with the civil 
conflict to the country was going 

114
00:06:24,771 --> 00:06:28,190
through the new government felt 
incapable of trusting the army,

115
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:31,190
all the police.
Since both institutions were corrupt,

116
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:33,500
they were disorganized and they were 
badly equipped.

117
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:34,363
That is why he made a decision.
He appointed several oligarchs is 

118
00:06:36,981 --> 00:06:40,220
governors of some of the most vulnerable
regions in the country.

119
00:06:40,250 --> 00:06:44,210
These oligarchs paid for that own 
private armies and with nice incentives,

120
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,250
the police followed their orders as 
well.

121
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:49,040
Earning a sum for the heads of every 
separatist.

122
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:50,240
Yeah,
but as I told you,

123
00:06:50,241 --> 00:06:51,074
the government essentially placed the 
mafia directly in charge of several 

124
00:06:53,301 --> 00:06:54,280
governorships.
Oh,

125
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:55,123
that was the case for e Hok.
Hello Boyski who was appointed governor 

126
00:06:56,991 --> 00:06:57,824
of Denise [inaudible].
I'm sorry if I'm screwing the 

127
00:06:59,631 --> 00:07:02,270
pronunciation up on that.
This took like 17 takes.

128
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,430
This region is one of the most important
in the country.

129
00:07:04,431 --> 00:07:06,110
Economically speaking.
So yes,

130
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:10,130
this is the Ukraine Mikhail Saccos 
philly was dealing with.

131
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,503
There was not a single state enterprise 
in Ukraine that has not been usurped by 

132
00:07:14,421 --> 00:07:16,990
one clan or another.
I verus Abramovic.

133
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:17,873
Yes,
former minister of economy and trade of 

134
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:20,900
Ukraine.
As you can imagine,

135
00:07:20,901 --> 00:07:25,070
all these oligarchs did not welcome 
Misha or his reform agenda.

136
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:25,933
Indeed,
once he was even kicked out of an 

137
00:07:26,811 --> 00:07:30,380
interview when he suggested all of these
mafia members have to be sent to prison,

138
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,980
that the media is also the property of 
the oligarchy.

139
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:34,843
The thing is Misha soon started to work 
to fight and ultimately ends the 

140
00:07:38,281 --> 00:07:39,114
situation.

141
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,443
I will do whatever it takes for complete
victory to read new crane of this filth 

142
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:48,553
of this corrupt scum which capitalize on
the blood of our soldiers whose only 

143
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:54,350
motivation in life is to fill its own 
pockets,

144
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:57,500
strengthen its own clan and bleed 
Ukraine dry,

145
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:58,393
Mikhail Saakashvili and so he did Misha.
It started to publicly report all kinds 

146
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:03,434
of influence,
peddling favorable treatment and 

147
00:08:04,941 --> 00:08:07,550
privileges.
On one occasion he even came on national

148
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:08,384
television and reported the details that
they corrupt scheme of the airlines 

149
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:11,953
owned by column Boyski and oligarch.
You'd nearly obtained a monopoly on 

150
00:08:14,661 --> 00:08:15,494
national flights.
The public reports ended the situation 

151
00:08:17,511 --> 00:08:19,330
and took many of the people involved to 
course.

152
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,720
Let's,
as you can imagine,

153
00:08:20,721 --> 00:08:23,210
Mr Colin [inaudible] didn't take it 
well.

154
00:08:23,270 --> 00:08:24,103
He promised to get his revenge and 
here's what he said about satish 

155
00:08:26,131 --> 00:08:26,964
civilian public.
When a dog without a muscle bite 

156
00:08:29,181 --> 00:08:30,014
someone,
we need to punish both the dog and more 

157
00:08:31,941 --> 00:08:34,430
importantly the owner.
He Horror Calamos Ski.

158
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:35,323
Now,
Dino thing that all Meesha did was 

159
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:38,320
report the oligarchs.
Not at all.

160
00:08:41,670 --> 00:08:42,503
Okay,

161
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:47,790
train crash Saakashvili is reforms in 
Odessa didn't complete the work.

162
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:53,410
Many of them were stops and sabotage by 
the government in Kiev.

163
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:55,320
This wasn't just the audio gox.
You see,

164
00:08:55,321 --> 00:08:56,154
corruption was so commonplace that it 
was difficult to tell the difference 

165
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:00,800
between the Mafia and the authority.

166
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:05,543
Nisha,
he didn't think twice the government 

167
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,643
became his target.
Many analysts claim that this new war 

168
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:14,680
against the government had a hidden 
agenda to take a leap.

169
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,450
International politics.
Well,

170
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:17,740
maybe,
but the thing is,

171
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:18,603
he did it.
He started by reporting the corruption 

172
00:09:20,021 --> 00:09:20,854
of the very prime minister.
Our any Yatsenyuk man's many ministers 

173
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:25,360
followed this.
Evil included his own friends.

174
00:09:25,361 --> 00:09:29,050
The president's Petro Poroshenko,
the person who had placed him in a Dasa.

175
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:30,623
What difference for Ukrainians does it 
make who will treat them like dirt 

176
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:35,800
Poroshenko or you're kind of itch?
What difference?

177
00:09:35,801 --> 00:09:38,230
Who will steal from them?
Mikhail Saakashvili,

178
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:41,790
the friendship that didn't last long as 
we have seen Poroshenko appointed meesha

179
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:45,730
governor in May of 2015 in just a year.
The battle it,

180
00:09:45,731 --> 00:09:45,880
yeah.

181
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,713
Gone.

182
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,643
Finally in November,
2016 at resigned as governor and began 

183
00:09:52,681 --> 00:09:53,514
his own political party.
The M N F I hadn't see soon gains more 

184
00:09:56,941 --> 00:09:59,070
than 20,000 members.
Yup.

185
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:00,023
The former Georgian presidents now 
wanted to lead Ukraine and his own 

186
00:10:02,941 --> 00:10:03,601
words.
Yes,

187
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:04,434
fine.
To turn this disaster of a country into 

188
00:10:05,911 --> 00:10:07,450
a complete European super.
Yeah.

189
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,900
Am I now be wondering about the 
responsive Poroshenko ans the government

190
00:10:14,901 --> 00:10:19,700
to this campaign and pay close attention
here in July,

191
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:21,840
2017 Poroshenko took advantage of the 
fact that there's a,

192
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:25,850
Misha was in the USA and he revoked his 
Ukrainian citizenship.

193
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:26,713
All of a sudden,
Mikhail Saakashvili was a stateless 

194
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,250
person.
Now if thing that stopped him,

195
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,800
you are absolutely wrong.
Look,

196
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,510
when his nationality,
it was taken away.

197
00:10:35,690 --> 00:10:37,850
Misha,
he simply moved opponents and we have to

198
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:38,684
say,
Michelle is a well loved guy in eastern 

199
00:10:39,861 --> 00:10:40,700
Europe.
In fact,

200
00:10:40,730 --> 00:10:43,880
many countries offered him citizenship,
but nope bishop,

201
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:47,030
he was determined to go back to Ukraine 
as well.

202
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,893
That's exactly what he did.
Despite the warnings of the government 

203
00:10:49,861 --> 00:10:52,970
to give on September the 10th surrounded
by a supportive crowd.

204
00:10:53,090 --> 00:10:56,840
Michelle crossed the border on foot 
between Poland and Ukraine.

205
00:10:56,870 --> 00:10:59,450
The images of his confrontation with the
border guards.

206
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,410
Well,
they're quite

207
00:11:00,690 --> 00:11:01,523
nice.

208
00:11:20,170 --> 00:11:23,920
What do you think is up to now that he's
back despite his irregular situation?

209
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:26,050
Nisha,
he's campaigning around the country,

210
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:28,960
but all of that said there is still an 
important question.

211
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:31,540
Why out [inaudible] Philly,

212
00:11:35,790 --> 00:11:36,623
the Saakashvili Revolution in 2003 
Michelle at a popular uprising against 

213
00:11:42,421 --> 00:11:43,254
the corrupt George and political system 
of Eduard Shevardnadze and then what is 

214
00:11:46,321 --> 00:11:47,154
known as the Rose Revolution.
He even made it to the Georgian 

215
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,673
parliament.
Elections were held mans as the 

216
00:11:51,301 --> 00:11:54,960
successful revolutions.
Nida Saakashvili easily beat the rest.

217
00:11:55,990 --> 00:11:56,823
The reform process that started there 
was a fierce fight against corruption 

218
00:11:59,530 --> 00:12:00,363
and a tough policy towards Moscow.
That came to be a model for the former 

219
00:12:02,951 --> 00:12:03,784
Soviet countries.
Plus we are going to discuss these 

220
00:12:07,271 --> 00:12:08,104
matters as well as the dark and less 
glamorous side of Saakashvili in a
