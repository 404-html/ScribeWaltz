1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,323
Kuwait's is alone with guitar,
the only country in the Arabian 

3
00:00:11,031 --> 00:00:13,850
peninsula where elections are hells.
Yep.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:14,773
You heard that right?
Many of you might know this country 

5
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:17,654
because of the oil reserves that wealth,
all the facts that they were invaded by 

6
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:25,580
Saddam Hussein in the 90s but Kuwait is 
much more than that.

7
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,380
It is one of the most tolerant nations 
in the Islamic world's women can vote.

8
00:00:30,410 --> 00:00:33,410
They can run for office and they even 
have a female

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:34,533
paint

10
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:39,850
lots and all of these apps.
For decades,

11
00:00:39,851 --> 00:00:44,230
the Kuwaiti royal family has been 
America's best friends in the Gulf.

12
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:45,093
This is why when they were invaded in 
1990 uncle Sam didn't hesitate for a 

13
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:50,890
moment and sent in their troops 
immediately.

14
00:00:51,290 --> 00:00:52,123
This will not stand.
This will not stand this aggression 

15
00:00:55,460 --> 00:00:56,600
against a Kuwait.

16
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,660
Now you might wonder,
why are we talking today about Kuwait?

17
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,673
Well,
this is the only Arab country alongside 

18
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:07,900
a man that hasn't joined the diplomatic 
of block of Qatar.

19
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:09,703
Yeah.

20
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,030
Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain,

21
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:12,923
Egypt,
and the United Arab Emirates broke off 

22
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:15,624
relations with Qatar in the worst 
diplomatic crisis to hit the Gulf Arab 

23
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:19,794
states in decades.
The three Gulf countries and Egypt 

24
00:01:22,260 --> 00:01:26,850
accused Qatar of supporting terrorism 
and destabilizing the region and now the

25
00:01:26,851 --> 00:01:27,684
big question is why is Kuwait is not on 
this list of nations who have cut ties 

26
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:32,004
with Qatar?
What kind of interest and does this 

27
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:36,750
country have in this diplomatic crisis?
How does that been?

28
00:01:36,751 --> 00:01:37,584
This has to work well today.
We are going to answer these questions 

29
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:41,363
before we do.
Let's get to know a bit more about this 

30
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:48,231
particular part of the planet.
Ooh,

31
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,244
in the Persian Gulf,
the first country we need to know about 

32
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,930
in the Arabian peninsula is Saudi 
Arabia.

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,320
Saudi Arabia is the biggest country in 
the region,

34
00:01:57,321 --> 00:02:00,050
both in terms of population and 
territory,

35
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:02,000
but it is not the only

36
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:02,900
country.
Yeah,

37
00:02:05,630 --> 00:02:07,910
yeah.
We have for United Arab Emirates,

38
00:02:07,911 --> 00:02:12,080
which Dubai and Abu Dhabi are a part of.
This country has its own government,

39
00:02:12,081 --> 00:02:12,914
its own laws and its own currency and 
this absolutely independent from the 

40
00:02:16,851 --> 00:02:18,770
Saudis.
The same goes for Qatar,

41
00:02:18,771 --> 00:02:19,604
which has its own foreign policy and 
holds better public relations with 

42
00:02:22,371 --> 00:02:25,550
enemies of the Saudis like the Islamic 
Republic of Iran.

43
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:29,253
And now you might be thinking that all 
of these countries have one important 

44
00:02:31,841 --> 00:02:32,674
thing in common.
The fact that they are all incredibly 

45
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,790
oil rich,
right?

46
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:38,740
Well,
actually that's pretty wrong.

47
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:42,880
Here we have the Republic of Yemen,
a country that is extremely poor.

48
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,870
Now of course it will if these countries
have a common history,

49
00:02:48,871 --> 00:02:52,740
common traditions as well as religion,
but make no mistake,

50
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:55,320
each of them have their own 
peculiarities.

51
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,273
For example,
the United Arab Emirates was the first 

52
00:02:57,871 --> 00:02:58,704
country who realized oil is not forever 
and therefore they decided to diversify 

53
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:04,420
their economy,
so they accrued,

54
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:05,254
represents just 3% of the total economy 
of Cuba is also a totally different 

55
00:03:11,871 --> 00:03:12,710
animal.
Yes,

56
00:03:12,711 --> 00:03:14,780
they have a monarchy,
the so called apnea,

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:17,420
but he is controlled buying eight 
constitution.

58
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:21,510
The parliament.
Well,

59
00:03:21,511 --> 00:03:22,344
hold on for just a second because this 
doesn't mean they are a 100% democratic 

60
00:03:26,131 --> 00:03:26,941
country.
In fact,

61
00:03:26,941 --> 00:03:29,370
their system,
it's way more complicated than that.

62
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:30,380
So,
well that's,

63
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,290
I'm looking at it now.

64
00:03:34,270 --> 00:03:35,103
Yeah.

65
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,960
Does semi democracy work in Kuwait?
Kuwait is known as a semi democracy.

66
00:03:44,060 --> 00:03:47,590
I'm like Saudi Arabia.
Kuwait has a freedom of religion.

67
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,600
This is why you can even find a catholic
church in the middle of Kuwait

68
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:52,553
City.

69
00:03:55,330 --> 00:03:56,163
Things like the hit job on north 
mandatory and even the laws regarding 

70
00:03:59,081 --> 00:03:59,914
alcohol.
Beth fairly liberal in comparison with 

71
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:03,960
their neighbors.
Of course it's still forbidden.

72
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:08,230
Nz buy and sell alcohol,
but it is legal to drink in privates.

73
00:04:08,290 --> 00:04:09,123
Nonetheless,
the main peculiarity about Kuwait are 

74
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,540
their elections.
All the adult natural born citizens have

75
00:04:13,541 --> 00:04:15,850
the right to vote their parliament every
four years.

76
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,520
This includes women in these elections.
Political parties are

77
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,490
a bit,
doesn't it

78
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,583
mean candidates have no ideology at all?
They can also campaign freely and have 

79
00:04:25,831 --> 00:04:27,210
debates.
Needless to say,

80
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,073
the political debate here is totally 
different compared to that in the UK or 

81
00:04:31,651 --> 00:04:32,484
the u s yeah,
the political spectrum is not only a 

82
00:04:34,711 --> 00:04:35,544
right wing or left wing kind of thing.
Of course some kinds of ads are highly 

83
00:04:38,281 --> 00:04:40,860
conservative and others are more liberal
and open.

84
00:04:40,861 --> 00:04:41,700
Z Western culture

85
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,593
sure

86
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:47,360
is not the only thing that divides 
Kuwaiti society.

87
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:51,380
There is also this never ending fights 
between Sunni Muslims and Shia Muslims.

88
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,360
This is because,
as I said before,

89
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:54,253
that is freedom of religion and that 
means the creed of the candidates is as 

90
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:00,700
important as his tax plan.
There's Mazzoni.

91
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:05,530
That bear is a nother big divide between
the so called urban voters am's,

92
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:08,690
the so called tribal once.
Just think about it for a moment.

93
00:05:08,691 --> 00:05:09,524
This is a country with a long nomadic 
tradition with half of the population 

94
00:05:13,281 --> 00:05:14,114
still living in tribes and these tribes 
that own primaries to choose that own 

95
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:23,860
candles.
Well said.

96
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:30,300
Elections are used to choose a national 
assembly with the power to make laws and

97
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:34,510
even put a veto on the policies taken by
the executive branch.

98
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,730
But now you might be wondering how old 
are the trees,

99
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,593
the prime minister,
all they voted for by mds as they do a 

100
00:05:39,851 --> 00:05:40,684
European countries or do they hold 
presidential elections like they do in 

101
00:05:43,241 --> 00:05:43,930
the US?

102
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:46,890
Sorry.
Well

103
00:05:46,910 --> 00:05:48,980
it's actually nothing like either of 
those.

104
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,040
As I said,
Kuwait is a semiotic democracy.

105
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,053
This means that the head of state is the
Amea and he chooses the prime minister 

106
00:05:56,660 --> 00:05:57,493
and his,
so maybe this sounds like those 

107
00:05:59,421 --> 00:06:00,470
European.
Absolutely.

108
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:03,170
Monica is that you studied about in 
history lessons?

109
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,870
Well,
it's not really exactly like that.

110
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,190
In fact,
in Arab monarchies,

111
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,024
the position of India is not inherited.
This is why in Saudi Arabia they have 

112
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:16,130
big internal battles to choose their 
leaders and as I explained in a previous

113
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,710
video,
royal families in this part of the wells

114
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:20,180
can have thousands of members.

115
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,783
Yes.

116
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,940
So in the case of Kuwait,
the members of the royal family,

117
00:06:26,941 --> 00:06:30,150
the so called Al Subar House can vote 
for the EMEA,

118
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:31,163
but right after the national assembly it
has to vote on whether they can accept 

119
00:06:34,801 --> 00:06:37,890
this decision or not.
But it's a hold on now for just a second

120
00:06:37,891 --> 00:06:40,650
because just in case the system wasn't 
complicated enough.

121
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:41,603
Here is another extra fact.
The constitution allows the air to 

122
00:06:45,421 --> 00:06:48,600
dissolve the parliaments many time he 
wants fans.

123
00:06:48,650 --> 00:06:50,600
Well that's something he does pretty 
often.

124
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:54,580
Amir

125
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,413
of Kuwait dissolves parliament.
The move announced on state media after 

126
00:06:58,841 --> 00:07:02,530
an emergency government meeting sets the
stage for early elections.

127
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,453
And believe me,
parliamentary debates in Kuwait are far 

128
00:07:05,801 --> 00:07:06,634
from being quiet.
Emergency meetings are a common thing 

129
00:07:08,711 --> 00:07:11,950
and sometimes it's really hard to get 
any kind of consensus.

130
00:07:12,010 --> 00:07:15,250
For some analysts.
This is one of the reasons that explains

131
00:07:15,251 --> 00:07:20,251
this.
The halakha economy,

132
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,823
we all know oil rich countries have so 
much money they can spend as if there 

133
00:07:25,341 --> 00:07:26,174
was no tomorrow,
most natural born Qac citizens work on 

134
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:32,330
civil sevens for the governments.
They pay no income tax,

135
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:35,810
their energy bills and subsidized and 
best salary as well.

136
00:07:35,811 --> 00:07:37,000
Then neutrik Christie,
yeah.

137
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:37,923
Hi.

138
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,630
Do people who work on oil rigs?
Well,

139
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,523
they're the foreigners,
but this is not only a rihanna see four 

140
00:07:45,171 --> 00:07:49,040
key ways it happens all over the region 
like goals is allowed to,

141
00:07:49,041 --> 00:07:51,110
all of these countries do enjoy this 
way,

142
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:56,111
right?
The question is,

143
00:07:58,951 --> 00:08:00,060
well,
what happens now,

144
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,953
as you probably know,
the market price for crude oil has 

145
00:08:02,461 --> 00:08:03,294
fallen in recent years.
Of course these oil Monica is are still 

146
00:08:06,031 --> 00:08:06,864
making profits but not enough to keep 
that system going and this is why today 

147
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,140
all of these countries have fiscal 
deficits.

148
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:16,710
This means they're spending is way 
higher than their income.

149
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,840
Hey

150
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,190
to the chart.
Even the USA I come through,

151
00:08:26,191 --> 00:08:27,024
which is really worried about his 
deficits is doing better than these 

152
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:32,840
countries.
I now you might wonder,

153
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,310
what does this figure actually mean?
Well,

154
00:08:35,340 --> 00:08:39,450
this means that if the Kuwaitis don't 
want to go bankrupt in just a few years,

155
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,790
they better find some alternative 
incomes,

156
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,760
not rely entirely on oil.
Nonetheless,

157
00:08:44,761 --> 00:08:47,280
despite two ways,
having the most to modern and democratic

158
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:48,114
political system,
they have the highest dependence on 

159
00:08:50,191 --> 00:08:55,191
crude oil.
Even Saudi Arabia regressive as they all

160
00:08:58,490 --> 00:09:01,250
is better prepared for a plummet in the 
price of oil,

161
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,113
and this is a surprise for everybody 
because during the 1970s Kuwait was the 

162
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:06,363
Rockstar of the region.
Now this title goes to Dubai despite it 

163
00:09:09,561 --> 00:09:11,720
being an absolute monarchy and this is 
left him in.

164
00:09:11,721 --> 00:09:15,290
The Arab is wondering whether democracy 
is compatible with economics.

165
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:16,683
Cool.

166
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,840
Wait,
has stagnated,

167
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:26,040
frustrating the people of a country once
seen as a Middle East trailblazer,

168
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,460
let's say that you want to start a 
logistics company in Dubai.

169
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:31,950
You just need to buy some land and build
the facilities,

170
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:32,940
right?
Well,

171
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,803
in Kuwait this is almost impossible.
The government's owns 90% of the 

172
00:09:37,711 --> 00:09:38,544
territory.
On the other hand is bureaucracy as 

173
00:09:40,021 --> 00:09:40,854
reached insane levels according to the 
world about in kids is easy to get to 

174
00:09:43,531 --> 00:09:48,420
start a business in countries like 
Ukraine or El Salvador than it is in Qa.

175
00:09:48,620 --> 00:09:49,453
Yes,

176
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,820
and all of this is despite the fact that
Kuwait has a lower corporate tax rate of

177
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,673
the Luxembourg added to this,
all these sky high salaries of civil 

178
00:10:00,281 --> 00:10:02,260
workers,
which rise year after year,

179
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:03,243
and you can probably imagine that no one
is going to become an entrepreneur and 

180
00:10:06,611 --> 00:10:07,444
to leave behind the comfort and safety 
of a government job to even the quiches 

181
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:14,700
and transfer the money outside because 
they cannot do business.

182
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,950
They're taught to do the short term,
the short term,

183
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,143
but now all of a sudden the Qatari 
crisis has offered Kuwait a chance to 

184
00:10:22,061 --> 00:10:25,690
emerge as a regional leader.
Their royal house has good relationships

185
00:10:25,691 --> 00:10:28,930
with all the countries involved,
including the United States,

186
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:29,793
Saudi Arabia and Qatar plus step 
analytical system is the most open and 

187
00:10:35,281 --> 00:10:37,230
democratic in the region.
In other words,

188
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:41,190
they have the best chance of becoming a 
mediator in this crisis.

189
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:46,390
And they're well aware of wait,
Amir to travel to Saudi for Qatar talks.

190
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:50,690
It's like,
now the question becomes,

191
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:54,440
do you think Kuwait's can take back its 
role as a regional leader?

192
00:10:54,590 --> 00:10:58,250
Can this crisis help them to showcase 
that country for foreign investments?

193
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,233

Meanwhile,
things are far from quiet in Saudi 

197
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:08,883
Arabia.
They're royal houses having an internal 

198
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:13,270
war to determine who is going to be the 
successor of the prince.
