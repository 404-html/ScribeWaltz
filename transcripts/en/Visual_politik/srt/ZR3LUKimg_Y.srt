1
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:10,650
Many of you have asked for this video,
and I'll be honest,

2
00:00:10,720 --> 00:00:11,553
we're not very surprised,
the Republic of China better known as 

3
00:00:14,011 --> 00:00:14,844
Taiwan has some of the most strange and 
controversial political and diplomatic 

4
00:00:17,371 --> 00:00:20,880
situations in the entire world.
So let me explain.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:21,803
At the time of publishing this video,
Taiwan has only received formal 

6
00:00:24,331 --> 00:00:28,440
recognition from 20 of the world's 
countries and some of these countries,

7
00:00:28,441 --> 00:00:29,580
well,
they're pretty small,

8
00:00:29,581 --> 00:00:34,581
like the Vatican Tuvalu in Swaziland 
fight all of this.

9
00:00:36,550 --> 00:00:37,383
Taiwan has managed to become one of the 
richest and freest countries on the 

10
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,164
planet.
It has a well equipped army and it is 

11
00:00:42,491 --> 00:00:46,420
one of these spear heads over the United
States in Southeast Asia.

12
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,533
Before we really get into it,
let's take a look back and see where it 

13
00:00:51,730 --> 00:00:56,730
began.
The great Chinese separation,

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:03,080
the situation Taiwan finds itself in has
its origin in the Chinese civil war,

15
00:01:03,081 --> 00:01:08,081
which took place between 1927 and 1949 
war between the conservative forces.

16
00:01:10,521 --> 00:01:11,354
The Chinese Nationalist Party led by 
Chiang Kai Shek and the forces of the 

17
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,050
Communist Party of Nazi Tome on December
the 10th,

18
00:01:18,051 --> 00:01:19,780
1949.
The last setting,

19
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:22,490
Chengdu fell into the hands of the 
nationalists.

20
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,560
The war had ended and the communists and
gotten their way shortly before Chang do

21
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:27,403
fell that they,
in carrying the nationalist leader 

22
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:31,550
Chiang Kai Shek,
left bound for Taiwan.

23
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,390
The last province under national list 
control z didn't go alone.

24
00:01:37,220 --> 00:01:38,053
Check 2 million more people,
took shelter in Taiwan along with the 

25
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:45,010
survivors of the nationalist army.
Since then ends,

26
00:01:45,011 --> 00:01:46,830
even though mal tried to take the 
islands back,

27
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,450
Taiwan has received support from the 
United States.

28
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,313
The US continued recognizing the 
governments over the island as the 

29
00:01:52,631 --> 00:01:56,560
legitimate government of China up until 
1979.

30
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:57,483
As a curious note here,
Taiwan is the only country other than 

31
00:01:59,621 --> 00:02:02,740
the US that is continually operated the 
youtube spy plane.

32
00:02:02,770 --> 00:02:04,970
Their mission was to monitor Mao's 
China.

33
00:02:06,190 --> 00:02:09,940
The CIA itself was actually in charge of
conducting these operations.

34
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:11,980
Nope.
About

35
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,560
1979.
It's a really important date.

36
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,453
At this time,
the United States was trying to build 

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,230
trust with Beijing.
This was in order to create some sort of

38
00:02:20,231 --> 00:02:22,810
a double envelopment against the Soviet 
Union.

39
00:02:22,870 --> 00:02:23,703
We actually talked about this in a 
previous video and I'll leave a link to 

40
00:02:26,231 --> 00:02:27,940
that in the description.
Well,

41
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,590
the thing is,
in 1979,

42
00:02:29,591 --> 00:02:31,830
the presidents of the United States,
Jimmy Carter,

43
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:32,683
decided to establish diplomatic 
relations with Beijing and mass meant 

44
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,490
that they had to stop recognizing the 
government of the Republic of China.

45
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,413
That is the government based in Taipei.
You see Taiwan that never declared its 

46
00:02:44,201 --> 00:02:46,630
independence for years.
The government based in Taipei,

47
00:02:46,631 --> 00:02:47,464
captain,
considering itself as the legitimate 

48
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:51,550
government of all of China as of course 
the country.

49
00:02:51,551 --> 00:02:56,551
You can only have diplomatically 
speaking one government and yes,

50
00:02:57,551 --> 00:02:58,384
this is how the one China started and 
today this is supported by Washington 

51
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,650
Adams.
Most countries around the world.

52
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,143
This is a change by the way,
the course Taiwan to lose its place in 

53
00:03:09,401 --> 00:03:13,000
the UN as well as other important 
international organizations,

54
00:03:15,550 --> 00:03:19,330
but it is true that the United States,
we're still committed to the security of

55
00:03:19,331 --> 00:03:20,680
Taiwan.
That same year,

56
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:21,543
in 1979,
the American Congress passed the Taiwan 

57
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:25,593
Relations Act.
This was documents that among other 

58
00:03:26,471 --> 00:03:27,304
things,
reserve the option for the US to ensure 

59
00:03:28,871 --> 00:03:29,704
the security and defense of the islands 
and since that act was passed for us 

60
00:03:33,190 --> 00:03:34,570
when it's done,
just that,

61
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:47,260
but as I was saying at the beginning of 
this video,

62
00:03:47,261 --> 00:03:48,094
none of these things have kept Taiwan 
from being the star of one of the 

63
00:03:50,981 --> 00:03:54,150
greatest stories of the economic and 
social success,

64
00:03:57,500 --> 00:03:58,790
big roar of the tiger,

65
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,610
fifties,
Taiwan.

66
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:02,473
It was a very poor place that had a 
pretty rudimentary economy where their 

67
00:04:05,181 --> 00:04:09,050
exports were basically really basic 
things like rice and sugar.

68
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:09,913
So the question at that time was,
how are we going to develop such a port 

69
00:04:13,370 --> 00:04:14,203
islands while the Taiwanese government 
thought the best way to achieve success 

70
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,443
was to ensure that businesses on the 
island could sell their products all 

71
00:04:20,421 --> 00:04:21,254
over the world?
This was considered to be the best way 

72
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:26,960
to open up the island to the world and 
even encouraged savings.

73
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,380
Yeah.
Am I seeing counter intuitive,

74
00:04:30,381 --> 00:04:31,214
but actually this action does encourage 
people to save because in order to 

75
00:04:34,161 --> 00:04:36,410
invest,
you first need to get the resources that

76
00:04:36,411 --> 00:04:39,890
are necessary to do so and well.
That's exactly what they did.

77
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:40,813
The governments of the islands soon 
started to eliminate almost all import 

78
00:04:44,091 --> 00:04:44,924
restrictions.
This meant the businesses could get all 

79
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:47,533
the products they required to set up 
their businesses and assembly lines 

80
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,833
without being stung by import fees.
This is sort of similar to what it's 

81
00:04:58,270 --> 00:04:59,103
this culture of saving attitude,
the legal certainty of the country and 

82
00:05:01,921 --> 00:05:04,630
so encouraged further investments world.
Soon enough,

83
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,780
Taiwanese companies began appearing like
mushrooms after the rain,

84
00:05:07,781 --> 00:05:10,720
as they exploded all kinds of products.
The rest of them,

85
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:13,863
tad industrial products,
we're already 90 percent of the 

86
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:18,970
country's exports and they were growing 
an average of 30 percent per year.

87
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:19,833
Yeah,

88
00:05:21,420 --> 00:05:23,440
they sold all kinds of things to the 
world,

89
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,450
toys,
radios,

90
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,440
bike,
socks,

91
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:27,210
just about everything.
And of course,

92
00:05:27,211 --> 00:05:28,044
as you can imagine with that sort of 
situation that the per capita income 

93
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,000
didn't stop growing in just 30 years.
It multiplied by F

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:35,953
fine

95
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:43,420
with that.
A new Asian tiger was born.

96
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:46,940
Now

97
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,850
don't a anything that this was an easy 
process.

98
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:49,684
I mean,
Taiwan didn't even have a democracy 

99
00:05:50,891 --> 00:05:53,950
until the 19 nineties,
but once they've got their freedom,

100
00:05:53,951 --> 00:05:56,920
the Taiwanese people,
they held onto it tightly.

101
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
Let's have a look at some example.
Is Today considered the 11 freest 

102
00:06:04,551 --> 00:06:05,384
economy in the world in Asia?
Only Hong Kong and Singapore rank best 

103
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,410
that it's a rich country with quite a 
high standard of living and it is one of

104
00:06:12,411 --> 00:06:13,244
the countries that has a significant 
number of civil liberties and in fact 

105
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,920
Taiwan,
they're about to make history.

106
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:19,863
Yeah.

107
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:20,703
Taiwan court rules in favor of same sex 
marriage in historic first for an Asian 

108
00:06:24,701 --> 00:06:25,534
country

109
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:33,820
who as you can see compared with 
continental China,

110
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,803
well,
there really is no comparison in terms 

111
00:06:36,551 --> 00:06:37,384
of per capita income.
The Taiwanese onto day three times 

112
00:06:39,581 --> 00:06:42,910
richer than the Chinese.
They are much more free,

113
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:43,823
but in spite of all of this good stuff,
there are still some clouds on the 

114
00:06:47,411 --> 00:06:48,310
horizon,

115
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:53,930
clouds in the Taiwanese sky.

116
00:06:55,530 --> 00:06:57,210
The truth is this,
in the last few years,

117
00:06:57,211 --> 00:06:59,520
the country has been going through a few
things.

118
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,790
Salaries have been frozen for years and 
didn't see thousand and 15.

119
00:07:02,791 --> 00:07:05,460
The country went through a small 
recessions since then.

120
00:07:05,461 --> 00:07:06,750
Economic growth,
well,

121
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,570
it's been very slow and now be rather 
obvious.

122
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:12,660
Question is what exactly is happening?
Well,

123
00:07:12,661 --> 00:07:15,630
there are several ingredients to this 
rather bitter recipe,

124
00:07:15,631 --> 00:07:17,250
which is threatening the future.

125
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:18,973
Yeah.

126
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,210
This is competition from new emerging 
markets like China,

127
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:25,500
Indonesia,
Vietnam,

128
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:26,663
also the brain drain and the aging 
population and the cliffs to broken 

129
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,233
pension system.
The latter of the pension system is the 

130
00:07:32,371 --> 00:07:36,000
problem vertebra by far concerns the 
government of the most.

131
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,220
Look for years,
the pensions of public workers.

132
00:07:38,221 --> 00:07:40,080
They were inflated for political 
reasons.

133
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,840
They did this in order to get votes.
Adams well,

134
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,690
it became really,
really expensive.

135
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:46,583
Public pensions whipped so inflated that
they are now threatening the stability 

136
00:07:49,951 --> 00:07:52,800
of the entire system.
Taiwanese

137
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,470
workers earn about 1300 US dollars per 
month on average,

138
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:57,333
but retired high school teachers receive
a whopping average pension of 2,250 US 

139
00:08:02,021 --> 00:08:02,854
dollars per month.

140
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:08,370
As you well know,
bad policies turnouts to be expensive.

141
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:11,570
Let's consider some of the other 
problems to continue our.

142
00:08:11,790 --> 00:08:16,790
For the next ingredients in our bitter 
recipe would be what is called the 40 40

143
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:18,810
issue.
It's like the Taiwanese economy.

144
00:08:18,811 --> 00:08:23,360
It's very dependent on the electronic 
industry as well as commerce in China,

145
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:24,643
no

146
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,180
goods or 40 percent of all of their 
export,

147
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:35,510
and China is the destination of almost 
40 percent of Taiwan's export,

148
00:08:39,920 --> 00:08:41,090
so now you might be wondering,
well,

149
00:08:41,091 --> 00:08:42,860
what exactly is the problem with that?
Well,

150
00:08:42,861 --> 00:08:46,670
this dependence on electronics and China
means that when the electronics industry

151
00:08:46,671 --> 00:08:49,100
or China isn't doing well,
economically,

152
00:08:49,250 --> 00:08:50,083
Taiwan suffers too,
and that's precisely what has happened 

153
00:08:53,181 --> 00:08:55,070
over the last few years,
but wait,

154
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,300
because we're not done yet.
Above all,

155
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:58,134
that is a political problem which has 
affected the country severely and has 

156
00:09:01,111 --> 00:09:01,944
caused for an investment in Taiwan to be
significantly lower than that of the 

157
00:09:05,341 --> 00:09:08,430
countries nearby and so well,
what's the problem that?

158
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,370
Well,
foreign investors are afraid of China.

159
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:15,663
The Chinese threat.
This is by far the biggest problem that 

160
00:09:20,491 --> 00:09:21,324
Taiwan is facing.
Humans of Beijing is determining to 

161
00:09:24,481 --> 00:09:25,314
regain sovereignty over the islands and 
it's made a public declaration on the 

162
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,810
data that states two things.
First of all,

163
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:32,460
it will happen before 20,
49,

164
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:35,160
the 100th anniversary of the People's 
Republic of China,

165
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:39,600
and secondly that they are willing to 
use force if Taiwan tries to declare its

166
00:09:39,601 --> 00:09:41,760
independence.
So let me dig into that.

167
00:09:41,761 --> 00:09:42,594
A little Taiwan could be considered an 
independent country from pretty much 

168
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,223
every perspective.
The island has its own presidents whose 

169
00:09:51,211 --> 00:09:54,090
democratically elected by the way,
it has its own laws.

170
00:09:54,091 --> 00:09:55,950
It has its own army.
However,

171
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:56,833
Beijing isn't going to accept formal 
independence the most they are willing 

172
00:10:00,661 --> 00:10:01,494
to give.
Taiwan temporarily is a status similar 

173
00:10:03,481 --> 00:10:07,620
to that of Hong Kong,
and this is pretty serious because among

174
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:08,483
other things,
most Taiwanese don't feel that their 

175
00:10:10,171 --> 00:10:11,340
identity is paint.

176
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,633
No

177
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:19,830
citizens of a free country,
which has been independent for almost 70

178
00:10:19,831 --> 00:10:20,940
years.
In fact,

179
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:21,803
in 2014 when the previous government 
solve Taiwan tried to approach Beijing 

180
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:26,004
to develop a trade agreements,
but Taiwanese people started a 

181
00:10:28,171 --> 00:10:32,160
revolution which eventually became known
as the sunflower revolution.

182
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:34,650
Hundreds of young people protested with 
the motto.

183
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,060
Taiwan is not.

184
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,203
Sale

185
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:42,663
was exactly under this atmosphere of 
economic and political frustration that 

186
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,750
in 2016,
the Democratic Progressive Policy,

187
00:10:49,930 --> 00:10:52,750
a party whose foundations were mainly 
pro independence,

188
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:57,780
one that the legislative and 
presidential election citing wing,

189
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,173
not the closest politician to Beijing 
that became the first female presidents 

190
00:11:01,901 --> 00:11:02,360
of Tyler

191
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,193
one,

192
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:07,070
even though the economy was the most 
crucial factor,

193
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,470
Beijing didn't like this election at 
all.

194
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,333
They disapproved of it so much that they
decided to start harassing Taiwan again 

195
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,583
in 2017 and up to now,
Chinese tourism to Taiwan has been 

196
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:21,710
reduced by 40 percent.
Beijing has convinced to countries,

197
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:22,573
Panama and Sao Tome and Principe to stop
recognizing Taiwan and it is blocking 

198
00:11:26,121 --> 00:11:29,000
the presence of the island in many 
international forums.

199
00:11:29,830 --> 00:11:32,300
For now,
there has been no economic retaliation,

200
00:11:32,301 --> 00:11:35,900
but the island knew that they could be 
in for a Sivia below.

201
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:36,793
This is why one of the priorities of the
new government is to open up to as many 

202
00:11:39,531 --> 00:11:42,170
new markets as possible as soon as 
possible.

203
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:44,990
So now you might be wondering where is 
the US and all of this.

204
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,640
I mean,
this is a visual politic video.

205
00:11:46,641 --> 00:11:47,474
After all,
and we've been a little light on the US 

206
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,630
so far,
so where are they?

207
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:51,291
Well,
for now,

208
00:11:51,291 --> 00:11:54,060
their support seems to remain in tact.
In fact,

209
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:55,840
trump's administration is already 
approved.

210
00:11:55,841 --> 00:11:59,440
A weapon sale to Taiwan went off at one 
point $5,000,000,000.

211
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:03,670
Trump administration approves first arms
sale to Taiwan,

212
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:05,043
and on top of all that,
the powerful Senate Arms Services 

213
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,620
Committee in the United States and navy 
ships to use Taiwanese ports,

214
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:11,483
and they did so with a majority of votes
from both the democratic and the 

215
00:12:14,411 --> 00:12:17,950
Republican parties in both chambers 
finally approved that decision.

216
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:21,250
You can bet to the Beijing,
they're going to be pretty annoyed.

217
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,430
Oh,
what is Washington's objective yet?

218
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:25,780
Well,
that would be to try and prevent Beijing

219
00:12:25,781 --> 00:12:26,614
from even thinking about a military 
invasion of Taiwan and that's pretty 

220
00:12:30,341 --> 00:12:31,450
much it for now.
Here are visual.

221
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:32,284
Politic wiggins.
Keep a close eye on Taiwan as the 

222
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:36,280
situation develops,
but now it's your turn.

223
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,770
What do you think the future of Taiwan 
will hold?

224
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,753
