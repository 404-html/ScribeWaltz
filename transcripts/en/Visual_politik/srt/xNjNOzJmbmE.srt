1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,923
a lot of people are wondering these days
whether it's possible to put the word 

3
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,133
Islam in the same sentence as democracy 
and human rights and to tell you the 

4
00:00:16,131 --> 00:00:16,964
truth,
if there are not that many examples to 

5
00:00:18,231 --> 00:00:21,380
be optimistic about.
Even in a country like Turkey where they

6
00:00:21,381 --> 00:00:24,590
have a guarantee of the separation of 
church and state,

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:28,490
they are still moving towards and 
Islamic theocracy.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,443
Nevertheless,
there is one country that is escaping 

9
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:34,210
this trends and that country is too,
right?

10
00:00:34,630 --> 00:00:35,463
Yeah.

11
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,333
Smith 10 million inhabitants.
Tunisia is the cradle of the so called 

12
00:00:43,420 --> 00:00:44,253
Arab spring.
You know that phenomena that started in 

13
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:46,894
the winter of 2011 anyway,
this is where everything started and 

14
00:00:49,991 --> 00:00:54,250
more specifically things started in the 
city of city Bosiat it things kicked off

15
00:00:54,251 --> 00:00:58,270
when a 26 year old fruit seller burned 
himself to death as a form of protest in

16
00:00:58,271 --> 00:00:59,104
front of a government building.
This is how a revolution spread all 

17
00:01:02,111 --> 00:01:03,070
across northern.
Yes,

18
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:03,923
I forgot.

19
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:08,760
And from here you probably do know the 
rest of the story.

20
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,653
In Egypt,
they overthrew their dictator only for 

21
00:01:11,041 --> 00:01:14,070
him to be replaced by a man who is 
probably even worse.

22
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:14,933
Libya is a failed state that has a high 
probability of becoming a radical 

23
00:01:18,031 --> 00:01:19,920
Islamic country.
And as well,

24
00:01:19,921 --> 00:01:23,100
let's just say it's probably best that 
we don't talk about Syria.

25
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,720
Among all of this madness,
though,

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,240
Tunusia is an exception after rounds 
thing.

27
00:01:27,241 --> 00:01:28,380
Their dictator,
Aberdeen,

28
00:01:28,381 --> 00:01:31,410
Ben Ali Dune is,
Ian's wrote a brand's new constitution,

29
00:01:31,411 --> 00:01:34,260
which was inspired by French law.
This new tanks.

30
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,140
It allows freedom of speech and freedom 
of religion,

31
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,033
but not only that,
now 20% of the country's parliamentary 

32
00:01:40,201 --> 00:01:41,034
seats are occupied by women.
This is a very big achievement if you 

33
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:46,380
consider to nausea to any other Islamic

34
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:47,293
country,

35
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,330
why Tunisia has become one of the main 
targets of Dash.

36
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,193
So far,
more than 73 people have died in three 

37
00:01:55,971 --> 00:01:56,804
separate terrorist attacks.
And this is what leads us to many 

38
00:01:59,331 --> 00:02:00,770
questions.
Cantonese,

39
00:02:00,771 --> 00:02:03,980
he and liberal democracy survive in such
a harsh environment.

40
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,800
Can tunusia become a model for 
neighboring countries?

41
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,010
Will the European Union help or damage 
this democracy?

42
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:10,903
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

43
00:02:11,841 --> 00:02:12,674
these questions for you,
but first we need to look a bit at the 

44
00:02:14,811 --> 00:02:15,950
history of tuners.
Yeah,

45
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:19,633
lights and shadows of abby met Ben 
[inaudible] in 1955 at Tunusia got its 

46
00:02:24,111 --> 00:02:27,860
independence from France just like other
countries in the region,

47
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,920
the Republic of [inaudible],
the so called Arab socialism or Pan Arab

48
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:33,913
Islam.
This was an ideological cocktail that 

49
00:02:35,301 --> 00:02:38,150
mixed authoritarianism,
charismatic leaders,

50
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:41,750
a centralized economy,
and finally a secular state.

51
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:44,510
You might to even say it's an anti 
religious state.

52
00:02:44,570 --> 00:02:48,190
This ideology became very fashionable in
the area that brought as tyrants,

53
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:51,140
such as Gaddafi in Libya and NASA in 
Egypt.

54
00:02:54,850 --> 00:02:57,760
In the Tennessean case,
the man is the man you are seeing on the

55
00:02:57,761 --> 00:02:59,740
screen now.
His name was happy,

56
00:02:59,741 --> 00:03:03,430
but Bourguiba in summary has government 
was famous for its corruption.

57
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,353
In summary,
has government was famous for its 

58
00:03:05,501 --> 00:03:06,334
corruption clientelism and it's 
systematic devaluations of the national 

59
00:03:09,701 --> 00:03:11,200
currency,
the dinner.

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,410
It's really no wonder that the economy 
eventually collapsed.

61
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,520
And so what was the outcome?
Well in 1987 presidents Bourguiba was it

62
00:03:18,521 --> 00:03:20,590
the hospital recovering from a heart 
attack?

63
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,840
It was at this point to that is prime 
minister Aberdeen.

64
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:23,674
Ben Ali took his seat.
June is Ian's called this events the 

65
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:26,524
medical cute Atar.
No blood was spills and actually there 

66
00:03:28,661 --> 00:03:32,200
was no violence whatsoever.
Even when Bourguiba left the hospital,

67
00:03:32,201 --> 00:03:33,034
Ben Ali sent into a luxury mentioned 
with a team of doctors and nurses to 

68
00:03:36,251 --> 00:03:37,084
take care of him.

69
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:43,440
Legend even says that he went to visit 
the man often.

70
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,100
So you can see that this was a coup 
guitar,

71
00:03:46,101 --> 00:03:49,200
but you can see that it was one with a 
lot of love and care.

72
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:51,360
So what did Ben Ali do?
Well,

73
00:03:51,361 --> 00:03:54,510
during his mandate,
he sent that he would bring democracy to

74
00:03:54,511 --> 00:03:58,080
Tunisia and while he did cool for 
elections several times,

75
00:03:58,081 --> 00:04:00,960
the problem was that in order to run in 
the elections,

76
00:04:00,961 --> 00:04:05,310
you needed the approval of 30 people 
from the existing government party.

77
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:08,490
This means that in most of the cases,
well surprise,

78
00:04:08,491 --> 00:04:09,324
surprise,
the only eligible candidates was one 

79
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:12,264
from the government.

80
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,813
Thanks

81
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:21,660
soul of this Ben Ali Hell's power for 23
years,

82
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:22,583
23 years.
That of course continued the tradition 

83
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,700
of corruption that the tune is Ian.
People have grown,

84
00:04:26,701 --> 00:04:27,534
used to,
but now there is something positive we 

85
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:30,054
should say about Mr Ben Ali and that is 
his economic practice from the stars of 

86
00:04:37,421 --> 00:04:38,254
this rule.
He encouraged foreign investment in 

87
00:04:39,581 --> 00:04:40,414
this,
encouraged a loss of foreign companies 

88
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,394
to establish themselves in Tunisia.
This is how several hotel chain started 

89
00:04:45,731 --> 00:04:47,950
up in the country.
You attracted by the great weather.

90
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:48,873
This led to tourism becoming tuners.
He main industry followed by the olive 

91
00:04:52,301 --> 00:04:53,134
industry.
And don't forget the latter of those 

92
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:56,140
because we're going to be coming back to
it shortly.

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,033
So during those 20 years,
tennesseans actually managed to 

94
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:02,530
multiplying the income by three.
In fact,

95
00:05:02,531 --> 00:05:06,400
in 2010 Tunusia boasted over 6 million 
tourists.

96
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:13,610
This is about half

97
00:05:13,610 --> 00:05:16,220
the number who visited neighboring 
Egypt's bar to do.

98
00:05:16,221 --> 00:05:17,054
Keep in mind here that Egypt has,
well the pyramids and also where 

99
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:21,980
population nine times the size of 
Tunisia.

100
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:23,750
Hey,
close attention to the numbers here.

101
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:24,753
Tunusia has a population of 10 million 
people and in a single year they hosted 

102
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:30,704
6 million tourists.
So why am I emphasizing this quite so 

103
00:05:33,771 --> 00:05:34,520
much?
Well,

104
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,270
that's because tourists are much more 
than an influx of money for the country.

105
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:40,610
They also bring with them another 
culture.

106
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:43,160
Suddenly in a country which is majority 
Islam,

107
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:43,994
it becomes normal for people to see 
women walking around without scarves on 

108
00:05:46,551 --> 00:05:47,384
their heads.
But I miss actual people to be seen 

109
00:05:48,651 --> 00:05:51,470
kissing in the streets and for people to
be drinking alcohol.

110
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:52,333
There is no other Islamic country that 
is quite so exposed to this level of 

111
00:05:55,371 --> 00:05:56,204
western culture.
So if you aren't one of those British 

112
00:05:57,831 --> 00:05:58,664
people,
you've got drunk in 18 izzy and hotel 

113
00:05:59,931 --> 00:06:04,070
well knew that you're doing your part 
for Tunez cultural diversity.

114
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,470
Well,
thanks to this wider cultural exposure,

115
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,600
something quite extraordinary happened.

116
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:16,060
Craddick transition in Tunisia in 2010 
the Tennessean economy,

117
00:06:16,061 --> 00:06:16,894
it was on fire,
but the unemployment rate was 12% added 

118
00:06:20,351 --> 00:06:21,184
to this word,
corruption scandals and power abuses 

119
00:06:23,321 --> 00:06:24,580
under Ben Ali,
his regime.

120
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:25,593
Now,
all of these things were of course 

121
00:06:26,291 --> 00:06:28,180
hidden from the people in the local 
press,

122
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:31,930
but due to the large amount of tourists,
a lot of foreign media was being brought

123
00:06:31,931 --> 00:06:34,360
into the country and this educated the 
people.

124
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,253
Now,
all of these things would never be 

125
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:38,740
published in the local press,
but the foreign media,

126
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,730
they were reporting everything and it's 
in a country with so much tourism,

127
00:06:42,731 --> 00:06:43,564
what is written outside can very easily 
be read inside so people knew what was 

128
00:06:47,621 --> 00:06:48,454
going on and they really didn't like it.
This land do demonstrations being 

129
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:52,744
organized in several cities,
perhaps these protests wouldn't have 

130
00:06:55,151 --> 00:06:57,850
been so big if it wasn't for Mohammed 
Bouazizi.

131
00:06:57,910 --> 00:07:02,260
He was a 26 year old man who burned 
himself to death in protest after police

132
00:07:02,261 --> 00:07:03,094
took over.
History

133
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:04,553
me

134
00:07:09,010 --> 00:07:12,730
is how the jasmine revolution started.
All of a sudden,

135
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:16,390
thousands of protestors gathered in 
every tune is Ian city.

136
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,100
Now,
unlike other dictators,

137
00:07:18,101 --> 00:07:18,934
Ben Ali didn't confront them,
but he simply lacks Ben Ali after 23 

138
00:07:27,161 --> 00:07:31,300
years in power and leaves Donisha after 
this momentous occasion,

139
00:07:31,330 --> 00:07:32,163
the presidents of the parliaments off 
Tunusia forms a provisional governments 

140
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:38,860
and fried over 500 political prisoners.
Not only that,

141
00:07:38,861 --> 00:07:39,694
but some teen,
is he a dissidence who were living in 

142
00:07:40,901 --> 00:07:43,150
exile,
came back to the country among them.

143
00:07:43,151 --> 00:07:43,984
But once this map Monsef Marzocchi,
he was the president of the Arab 

144
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,353
Commission on Human Rights.

145
00:07:50,570 --> 00:07:53,070
You might wonder now is whether the 
Tunisia,

146
00:07:53,071 --> 00:07:56,910
we are talking,
it's Islamic and the answer is no.

147
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:58,103
The donisha where

148
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,020
talking,
he's the more private.

149
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:02,930
So a year off the bow is easy,
burnt himself to death.

150
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:07,400
Junior Xeo was holding their first free 
elections and our friends Marzouki would

151
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:10,580
become the first president.
So what exactly was the problem?

152
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:11,623
Well,
the president was from the Islamist 

153
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:17,831
party talking about the [inaudible] 
movement,

154
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,813
the Tunisia,
and then it's perhaps more moderate 

155
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:22,864
version of the Islamic brotherhood.
Anytime when over 100 political parties 

156
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:29,860
appeared in Nardo was the only one with 
an efficient structure.

157
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:30,843
This is why the party one,
the majority of the seats in the tunas 

158
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:34,083
in parliament,
this is particularly problematic if we 

159
00:08:35,981 --> 00:08:36,814
take into account that this was the 
party that was going to be responsible 

160
00:08:39,311 --> 00:08:41,950
for crafting the new [inaudible] 
constantly.

161
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,733
Sure.

162
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:46,763
So you might be wondering after this,
I wasn't that the tune is Ian 

163
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:51,510
Constitution remains so secular.
Well,

164
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:53,143
okay.

165
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:03,500
Entrepeneur critical uncertainty is the 
hardcore isn't a,

166
00:09:03,570 --> 00:09:06,260
it's created these so called Islamic 
leaks.

167
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:07,123
Visa of course supported the ruling 
party in order to speed up the 

168
00:09:11,030 --> 00:09:13,060
Islamification of the country.
This led to violence on the streets and

169
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,480
yes,

170
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:21,870
Tanisha shocked by assassinations,
opposition leaders,

171
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,930
Mohamed [inaudible] and Chuck Green.

172
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:24,863
Meanwhile,
the income from tourism was falling 

173
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:27,503
sharply.
No one wants to travel to a dangerous 

174
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:34,080
country and this generated more and more
social unrest with this situation.

175
00:09:34,081 --> 00:09:34,914
The secular parties created a common 
front against Ennahda and this is how 

176
00:09:38,161 --> 00:09:38,994
the Islam is to block,
was forced to have secular politicians 

177
00:09:41,071 --> 00:09:42,870
in their cabinet.
Months later,

178
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:43,704
both the Islamists Leagues and the 
Muslim Brotherhood were considered 

179
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,020
terrorist organizations by the Tunisian 
government.

180
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:50,043
And of course the most extreme 
politicians had to leave the government 

181
00:09:52,201 --> 00:09:53,034
as well.
Actually in some months the whole 

182
00:09:54,541 --> 00:09:56,790
Ennahda movements and left the cabinet 
and the left,

183
00:09:56,791 --> 00:09:59,000
the decision making power in the hands 
of the secular

184
00:10:03,690 --> 00:10:04,523
did this with just one condition.
And that is that Islam must remain the 

185
00:10:07,921 --> 00:10:10,380
official religion in the new 
constitution.

186
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:12,420
So what was the result of all of this?
Well,

187
00:10:12,421 --> 00:10:13,254
the Newtonian constitution is not based 
on sharia law and it includes both 

188
00:10:16,561 --> 00:10:18,750
freedom of religion and freedom of 
speech,

189
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,613
but not only that,
it also guarantees a nonreligious 

190
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,070
education.
Islam now holds only a symbolic position

191
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:26,933
in Tunisia.
The reality is that when it comes to 

192
00:10:28,471 --> 00:10:31,440
politics,
Tunisia is a secular nation,

193
00:10:31,530 --> 00:10:35,010
new free media organizations within 
formed and to watch followed.

194
00:10:35,011 --> 00:10:35,844
This was the creation of one of the 
strongest civil societies and the whole 

195
00:10:39,481 --> 00:10:40,314
of North Africa after this.
It is no surprise that during the 

196
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:47,481
elections in 2014 Islamist parties lost 
to the secular liberal coalition.

197
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,850
No,

198
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:54,840
still they believe me about the 
influence of tourism in Tunisia.

199
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,733
Well,
we'll have a look at this electoral map 

200
00:10:57,210 --> 00:10:58,043
on this map.
You can see how the Islamists lost in 

201
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:01,620
the regions that are closer to the 
coast,

202
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,680
and this is because that's where all the
hotels and resorts are.

203
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:08,550
Hold on a second because things are 
about to get a little agreement.

204
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:11,490
Ooh,

205
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,770
strengthening Tunisian democracy

206
00:11:13,960 --> 00:11:14,930
months.
After two years,

207
00:11:14,931 --> 00:11:15,764
he had published that constitution dash 
or the Islamic state organized that 

208
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:21,850
first terrorist attack against the El 
Barrio museum.

209
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,420
This is one of the main tourist 
attractions in there

210
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:25,473
country.

211
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,180
As I resolved,
the number of British rivals,

212
00:11:30,330 --> 00:11:35,330
which looked set to break records in the
early months of 2015 has fallen by 93.2%

213
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,260
for the first five months of these 
years.

214
00:11:40,520 --> 00:11:44,360
After this two attacks followed and in 
total 73 people were left to debt.

215
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:45,283
This is why teaching is Ian Government 
has a security crisis as well as an 

216
00:11:48,231 --> 00:11:51,410
economic crisis and to one of them is 
destroying their main industry,

217
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,100
which is why stories like this not quite
so important.

218
00:11:58,370 --> 00:11:59,040
Donisha

219
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:03,160
do you offer $50 billion of projects to 
foreign investors?

220
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:04,113
Not only that,
but the European Union has also 

221
00:12:05,471 --> 00:12:08,800
eliminated or fairs on the import of 
Tennessee and olive oil.

222
00:12:08,860 --> 00:12:10,330
As you know,
in the European Union,

223
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:12,760
agriculture is protected from foreign 
markets,

224
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:16,570
but in the case of Tunisia,
it is essential in order to support that

225
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,220
all of industry.
As I said before,

226
00:12:18,221 --> 00:12:21,610
he says the second largest industry in 
the country behind tourism,

227
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,400
but it's a hold on it for a moment 
because as you can probably imagine,

228
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:27,070
this didn't make the European farmers 
too happy.

229
00:12:27,160 --> 00:12:28,930
Especially those ones based in 
[inaudible].

230
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:29,983
Yes,

231
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:35,040
save our quality.
Say no due to donation.

232
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,960
Oh,
well this is the specialty.

233
00:12:36,961 --> 00:12:37,701
Funny.
You're given them.

234
00:12:37,701 --> 00:12:38,534
Most of that oil that is labeled as a 
made in Italy is actually produced in 

235
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:42,954
Tunisia and then ships to Italy where it
is labeled and this is where the 

236
00:12:47,581 --> 00:12:50,580
political battle starts.
In Europe on the one hands,

237
00:12:50,581 --> 00:12:51,414
it is crucial to help the teen is in 
economy so they can maintain their 

238
00:12:54,151 --> 00:12:56,130
democracy,
but on the other hands,

239
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:59,670
a lot of European countries don't want 
to lose their privileges.

240
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:04,433
Question is,
do you think Europe should open its 

241
00:13:06,361 --> 00:13:07,194
market to at Tunusia?
Do you think that it is an important 

242
00:13:09,451 --> 00:13:13,470
sacrifice to make in order to prevent 
political unrest in the country?

243
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:14,393
And do you think June is here,
could become a model for neighboring 

244
00:13:16,141 --> 00:13:17,130
countries?
Well,

245
00:13:17,131 --> 00:13:19,920
do let us know.
That's what the comment section below is

246
