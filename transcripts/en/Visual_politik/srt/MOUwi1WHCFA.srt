1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,430
Qatar is the wealthiest country on the 
planet.

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,360
They're citizens enjoy a higher GDP per 
capita than the Swiss,

4
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,920
or indeed any of the nationals from any 
of the other oil rich monarchies.

5
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:21,680
But today we are not going to talk about
this.

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,533
In fact,
the most important factor of this 

7
00:00:23,691 --> 00:00:24,524
country is not their wealth,
nor their absolute monarchy or their 

8
00:00:26,781 --> 00:00:27,614
ties with radical terrorist green.
Any doubt what made this country famous 

9
00:00:36,061 --> 00:00:40,800
can be summarized in just two words,
and those words are Algebra zero.

10
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:44,723
It is the most influential TV network in
the Arab world as one of the most 

11
00:00:47,821 --> 00:00:50,490
important news networks on the entire 
planet.

12
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:51,373
But at the beginning of the 1990s the 
royal family that rules guitar with an 

13
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,970
Iron Fist,
the Al Tawny House had a dream.

14
00:00:57,240 --> 00:01:00,810
They wanted to turn the nation into the 
hedge and monique leader in the region.

15
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,780
But the question was,
how could they achieve this goal?

16
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:07,353
I mean,
we're talking about a tiny country with 

17
00:01:08,591 --> 00:01:11,230
a smaller population than the city of 
Chicago.

18
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:14,860
Of course they couldn't rival Saudi 
Arabia in the military fields and sharia

19
00:01:14,861 --> 00:01:17,770
law made it impossible to be a financial
powerhouse.

20
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:18,753
Further,
their geographical position was nothing 

21
00:01:20,321 --> 00:01:24,070
special either.
There was only one possible strategy and

22
00:01:24,071 --> 00:01:26,740
that was the idea of so called soft

23
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,773
Hawaii

24
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,420
and otherwise influenced diplomacy.
Well proper Ganzer.

25
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,433
Since then,
Qatar has invested more than any other 

26
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,404
country in improving their image to 
outsiders by doing things like hosting 

27
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:41,604
the soccer World Cup in 2020 to a 
formula one race and even directly 

28
00:01:45,811 --> 00:01:50,811
sponsoring soccer teams.
Among all these projects,

29
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:57,090
the most successful am's famous of them 
all has to be their TV network,

30
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,013
Algebra Xera.
They aren't the market leader in terms 

31
00:01:59,851 --> 00:02:02,990
of audience in the entire Arab wells.
In fact,

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,960
their market share some policies all of 
their rivals put together,

33
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,490
and this is all despite the fact that 
the channel is banned in most countries.

34
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:23,223
I'll just say rabbi has led to the 
overthrow of governments in several 

35
00:02:25,301 --> 00:02:26,134
nations.
They have amplified the effects of the 

36
00:02:27,611 --> 00:02:28,444
Arab spring and they've even become the 
unofficial loudspeaker for some 

37
00:02:31,631 --> 00:02:35,800
terrorist groups since the attacks of 
September the 11th Algers era has become

38
00:02:35,801 --> 00:02:36,634
in many ways the only source of 
information for understanding what is 

39
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:44,770
going on in some parts of the worlds.
Even CNN buys their footage.

40
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:48,700
In other words,
they are a respected media institution,

41
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,590
but then again you might wonder,
well,

42
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:53,710
isn't Al Jazeera just a state propaganda
channel?

43
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:54,663
I mean,
to what extent should we really trust 

44
00:02:56,441 --> 00:02:59,050
their information and it's importantly 
what's their,

45
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:00,903
well,
today we are going to answer all of 

46
00:03:02,471 --> 00:03:04,450
these questions,
but before we do that,

47
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:09,690
let's take a look at some history.
Importance of being unique.

48
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,740
In 1995 the BBC clothes,
that Arab channel,

49
00:03:13,741 --> 00:03:17,790
because the Saudi government wanted to 
interfere in their editorial process,

50
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:18,683
150 journalism's got fired.
All of them are of journalists who were 

51
00:03:22,291 --> 00:03:26,760
trained at one of the most prestigious 
media organizations in the world.

52
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:29,640
These people have a deep knowledge of 
Muslim culture,

53
00:03:29,641 --> 00:03:33,300
but at the same time they couldn't meet 
the high standards of Western media.

54
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,490
This is where the emir of Qatar at the 
time,

55
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:37,280
the hammered I'll tawny comes in.
Right,

56
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:42,403
okay.

57
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:46,790
Tommy had just come to power,
had a clear vision for his country.

58
00:03:46,940 --> 00:03:50,120
He wanted it to become the leader of the
Islamic world.

59
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:53,870
In order to achieve that,
those 150 unemployed journalists weren't

60
00:03:53,871 --> 00:03:56,630
given an opportunity.
As soon as they lost their jobs.

61
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,910
Qatar offered them brands,
new ones.

62
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,440
Now what was their mission?
Well,

63
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:01,303
that was to create a brand new news 
network and Arab speaking media route 

64
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:07,700
and led that would meet the quality of 
Western media bounce.

65
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:12,701
Benny cost has governments gave them a 
$147 million loan and with that,

66
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,470
this team of 150 journalists could by 
state of the art studios.

67
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:22,610
I've correspondence in many countries 
and broadcast through a satellite.

68
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,813
Everything

69
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,640
little detail was taken care of,
for example,

70
00:04:29,641 --> 00:04:32,550
to design their logo via media made a 
public contest.

71
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:33,660
Finally,
this one,

72
00:04:33,661 --> 00:04:34,494
the one that you see on the screen now 
was the winner and as you can see and 

73
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:38,230
reads Algers Aaron

74
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:43,993
[inaudible] in 1996 Al Jazeera.
That means the island in Arabic started 

75
00:04:47,531 --> 00:04:50,740
broadcasting to the Arab world in very 
little time at all.

76
00:04:50,741 --> 00:04:53,470
They surpass the rest of their rivals.
I think about it.

77
00:04:53,471 --> 00:04:54,460
I need,
back in the day,

78
00:04:54,461 --> 00:04:58,000
Arab TV was extremely boring in this 
part of the world.

79
00:04:58,030 --> 00:04:58,863
Freedom of expression doesn't really 
exist and is therefore tv news just 

80
00:05:02,831 --> 00:05:04,840
offered official announcements.
I'll zero.

81
00:05:04,870 --> 00:05:05,703
It was different.
They had a new problem with criticizing 

82
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:12,010
various politicians and royal families.
They showed corruption scandals,

83
00:05:12,011 --> 00:05:12,844
Sam's,
they even interviewed political 

84
00:05:13,781 --> 00:05:14,614
dissonance.
All of this was done in a dynamic style 

85
00:05:16,811 --> 00:05:19,570
that had never been seen on Arabic 
television before.

86
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:25,000
Nevertheless,
the real turning point for elders here,

87
00:05:25,001 --> 00:05:25,834
right,
was nine 11 or some have been laws and 

88
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:30,840
use this TV networks or broadcast his 
claim to the terrorist attack.

89
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:34,290
All of a sudden,
the name Algebra Syrup was being said on

90
00:05:34,291 --> 00:05:35,124
TV.
News arounds the wells butts and 

91
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:38,940
autonomy that a month after the 
terrorist attack,

92
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:41,850
the American government declared war on 
Afghanistan.

93
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:42,743
Back then,
all the big media corporations like CNN 

94
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:47,880
or CNBC had correspondence in Tokyo,
London,

95
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,714
or Berlin.
There's no one had thought Kabul would 

96
00:05:50,491 --> 00:05:51,590
be that newsletter.

97
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:52,723
Great.

98
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:56,103
Don's well.
Dessie did an office in the Afghan 

99
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,300
capital.
Yup.

100
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,253
That would be Algebra Jazeera.
Since they were a channel targeted to 

101
00:06:02,811 --> 00:06:03,644
the Muslim world,
they had correspondence in all of the 

102
00:06:05,421 --> 00:06:06,254
Muslim countries.
Suddenly Algers era footage was 

103
00:06:08,211 --> 00:06:10,490
appearing on televisions all around the 
world.

104
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:11,353
This is why in 2004 the emir of Qatar 
realized that what he had it not only 

105
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,540
was a powerful tool to reach the Arab 
world,

106
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:18,553
but indeed the world at large and this 
is how English elder Xero was born and 

107
00:06:23,031 --> 00:06:23,864
it was ready to broadcast into the most 
competitive media market in the world 

108
00:06:27,110 --> 00:06:28,940
for United States of America.

109
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,113
Thanks.

110
00:06:32,710 --> 00:06:33,543
Then Al Jazeera has become the TV news.
The book's about countries that never 

111
00:06:36,671 --> 00:06:39,610
appear on American TV news wants to know
about Africa.

112
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:41,950
Well tuned down with was era.
What about the Middle East?

113
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,140
Again,
go to Al Jazeera Central Asia.

114
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,120
Yup.
You're beginning to get the picture.

115
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,273
Lots of do.
Wait a minute because things are not 

116
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:52,070
quite as great as they seem to be.
Don't forget to,

117
00:06:52,071 --> 00:06:52,904
we are talking about a TV now.
It's work that is being paid for by 

118
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:58,690
government in order to influence other 
countries.

119
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:01,440
Starting to sounds a bit like it might 
be propaganda.

120
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:04,060
Well,
let's dive a little bit deeper.

121
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:10,980
Islam's on fault.
[inaudible] as we said before,

122
00:07:10,981 --> 00:07:11,814
Algebra's era was the first Arab TV 
network that openly criticized the 

123
00:07:15,091 --> 00:07:16,200
governments in other countries.

124
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:21,240
We started the revolution back in 2011 
rather.

125
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:21,400
Yeah.

126
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:24,790
I'm surprisingly,
this was not always welcome,

127
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:28,510
especially given that most of these 
other countries are dictatorships.

128
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:29,373
So in 2011 an uprising in Tunisia 
started out and the dictator of this 

129
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,380
nation abandoned.
There's all of these facts.

130
00:07:35,381 --> 00:07:37,550
Could have had little to no impact 
abroad.

131
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:38,523
There's Al Jazeera handed deep coverage 
of this uprising so that it can be seen 

132
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:45,190
in other countries.
Since it was a satellite station,

133
00:07:45,191 --> 00:07:46,024
this signal was arriving,
decides all across north Africa and the 

134
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:49,600
Arabian peninsula.

135
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:50,453
See,
that

136
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:57,100
is how the inhabitants in other 
countries and next to Tina,

137
00:07:57,101 --> 00:08:00,190
Ziad like Egypt saw their neighbor's 
protesting and thought,

138
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:02,380
wait a minute,
we've also got a dictator.

139
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:04,390
Couldn't we do something just like that 
ends.

140
00:08:04,391 --> 00:08:06,570
Of course,
nearly every person in oppositions,

141
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:10,210
you've never like had a news show that 
they could now watch ads.

142
00:08:10,211 --> 00:08:11,044
Of course,
this was not something that wins over 

143
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,430
and brilliantly.
Windows dictator.

144
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:15,293
Yeah,

145
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:18,243
I'll just,

146
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,110
or a shutdown in Egypt as Mubarak fights
for control of Airway,

147
00:08:22,111 --> 00:08:26,220
right.
Well,

148
00:08:26,221 --> 00:08:27,960
what exactly is the problem here?
Well,

149
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:31,260
censoring the satellite TV station is 
harder than it seems.

150
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:33,660
Of course.
You can forbid it if you want,

151
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:37,830
but if someone wants to access the 
station and they have a satellite dish,

152
00:08:37,920 --> 00:08:39,600
then technically it's possible.

153
00:08:39,670 --> 00:08:41,940
If you were having problems receiving 
any allergies,

154
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:42,774
there are channels.
This guide will take you through the 

155
00:08:44,291 --> 00:08:46,420
process of tuning your satellite 
receiver,

156
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:48,780
sorry.
In a matter of a month,

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,663
all of these Arab citizens were seeing 
then neighboring countries overthrowing 

158
00:08:52,731 --> 00:08:57,120
their dictators and this explains in 
part the Arab spring phenomenon.

159
00:08:58,950 --> 00:08:59,783
No,
wait a minute again because not 

160
00:09:03,241 --> 00:09:05,310
everything is perfect.
Of course.

161
00:09:05,311 --> 00:09:08,160
Salvagers there it helps to finish off a
lot of dictatorships,

162
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,113
but the truth is the people they 
promoted on their network when not 

163
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:17,270
really any more democratic.
We came down for years.

164
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,483
The Muslim Brotherhood spiritual leader 
was given his own television show on Al 

165
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,433
Jazeera,
even dash the Islamic state was 

166
00:09:30,661 --> 00:09:31,494
portrayed by Al Jazeera as Johnston 
opposition force to al Assad in Syria 

167
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:36,293
and even as a group of moderate rebels.
The same happens with other Sunni 

168
00:09:39,691 --> 00:09:44,690
radical terrorists like al Qaeda and now
you might be wondering is Al Jazeera and

169
00:09:44,691 --> 00:09:47,880
network as it stands for radicalism and 
against the West?

170
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:48,983
Well,
the truth is they've also been accused 

171
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:51,114
of just the opposite.
Just ask the mayor of Bahrain and as 

172
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:54,723
governor,

173
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,800
Yeah,

174
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:57,633
Information Nabeel,
I'll hummer told journalists that Al 

175
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,620
Jazeera correspondence had been banned 
from Bahrain.

176
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,663
I'll hummer claimed that the station was
a medium for quote Zionist infiltration 

177
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:07,730
of the Gulf

178
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:08,563
free drinks.

179
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:17,140
Surprised well for many Alphas era is a 
Zionist western propaganda.

180
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:18,003
While for others it's the TV station of 
the radicals in fact is the only common 

181
00:10:21,581 --> 00:10:22,414
grounds for Al Jazeera when it comes to 
ideology is the interests of the ones 

182
00:10:25,901 --> 00:10:28,990
who finance them.
The royal house of Owl Tawny,

183
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:34,170
who by the way don't support freedom of 
speech and that beaks cables claim algae

184
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:43,610
zero changed coverage to suit Qatari 
foreign policy.

185
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,593
Nevertheless,
if this doesn't mean they cannot show 

186
00:10:45,591 --> 00:10:46,424
the dark side of guitar in fact to 
display being paid for by the royal 

187
00:10:49,221 --> 00:10:50,054
house.
Eldora Xera is more independent than 

188
00:10:51,531 --> 00:10:53,330
many other states sponsored news net

189
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,233
blacks

190
00:10:57,510 --> 00:10:58,343
for instance.
What you see on the screen here are 

191
00:10:59,941 --> 00:11:02,400
extracts from a talk show about being 
near slave,

192
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:04,720
like whacking conditions suffered by 
immigrants,

193
00:11:04,721 --> 00:11:07,140
see work in Qatar as construction 
workers.

194
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,813
This show foreign trade unionists were 
invited and had the chance to open the 

195
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:15,660
criticize the Al Tiny family and their 
policies.

196
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:16,610
In other words,
Algebra,

197
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:21,570
there is directors are smart enough to 
limit that propaganda and not lose their

198
00:11:21,571 --> 00:11:22,404
audience.
Of course they have an ideology and a 

199
00:11:24,601 --> 00:11:25,434
lot of interests to meet but they are 
all aware but in today's world you 

200
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:32,940
cannot silence the reality of what's 
happening because if you don't tell us,

201
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:38,120
oh this is going to tell it for you.
The end of the day.

202
00:11:38,921 --> 00:11:42,160
Al Jazeera is forbidden in almost all 
countries in the region,

203
00:11:42,161 --> 00:11:44,320
including Saudi Arabia.
Nonetheless,

204
00:11:44,350 --> 00:11:46,610
they are still the most influential 
amels,

205
00:11:46,611 --> 00:11:49,870
most watched TV network.
Everyone knows who pays for them,

206
00:11:49,871 --> 00:11:53,740
but at the same time that they are the 
only source for many of the topics.

207
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:54,813
In fact,
the Al Jazeera model has lots of 

208
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:57,153
copycats.
In 2003 the Saudis founded their own 

209
00:11:59,171 --> 00:12:00,004
channel ally Realia.
Further of the American government has 

210
00:12:01,991 --> 00:12:04,950
their own narrative speaking network 
called Aha Ron.

211
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:13,793
What about Iranian TV?
His farm TV as a Spanish speaking 

212
00:12:16,291 --> 00:12:17,124
network paid for by the Iranian 
government in order to influence the 

213
00:12:19,891 --> 00:12:20,724
Hispanic world.
They also have an English speaking 

214
00:12:22,381 --> 00:12:23,214
channel called press TV and 2005 Russia 
launched Russia today also known as 

215
00:12:27,370 --> 00:12:28,203
[inaudible].

216
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,153
Wow.

217
00:12:31,190 --> 00:12:33,800
Algebra here,
rob keeps exploring new possibilities.

218
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:38,570
Their latest creation is a plus j a 
facebook page where they share viral.

219
00:12:38,810 --> 00:12:39,643
Yes.

220
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:49,360
As now all question,
it goes to you and that would be,

221
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,194
do you think you'd stop watching Al 
Jazeera because you think it's 

222
00:12:52,211 --> 00:12:55,330
propaganda or when do you keep enjoying 
the show as well?

223
00:12:55,370 --> 00:12:56,203
Maybe adding a pinch of salt.
You can leave me your answer in the 

224
00:12:58,481 --> 00:12:59,314
comment section below.
I'd love to Harris and also talking 

225
00:13:01,841 --> 00:13:02,674
about propaganda.

226
