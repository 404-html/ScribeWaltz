1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,580
Imagine this situation,
you live in London and you want to buy a

2
00:00:02,581 --> 00:00:07,350
house in San Francisco,
the house costs one point $3 million.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:08,243
It's what comes in first,
your payments or the handover of the 

4
00:00:10,921 --> 00:00:12,720
keys.
If you happen to pay first,

5
00:00:12,721 --> 00:00:13,554
you might fall into a scam.
Maybe the house doesn't really exist or 

6
00:00:15,931 --> 00:00:18,430
it's not owned by the person that you 
contact us.

7
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:21,180
Don't forget that you can live a really 
long way away from that.

8
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:29,580
You never met the person who's selling 
the house and believe me,

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,090
you're not the first person or the last 
is going to lose money through an online

10
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,250
scam like this.
Ridiculous as it sounds,

11
00:00:35,251 --> 00:00:36,084
this is actually one of the most 
complicated problems that exists in 

12
00:00:39,031 --> 00:00:42,210
economics and that's trust.
But I know what you're thinking.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,090
You click this video expecting something
about blockchain,

14
00:00:45,091 --> 00:00:45,924
about cryptocurrencies and bitcoin.
What does all of this I have to deal 

15
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,760
with that.
Well,

16
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,520
I'll tell you,

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,353
yeah.

18
00:00:58,940 --> 00:00:59,773
Nowadays we've all heard of bitcoin and 
I'm sure many of you know of some other 

19
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:04,910
cryptocurrencies as well,
like a theory.

20
00:01:04,911 --> 00:01:05,744
I'm light coin or riddle if you've dug 
deeper into this matter and you might 

21
00:01:08,181 --> 00:01:13,181
also have heard about another term and 
that's blockchain for many.

22
00:01:16,091 --> 00:01:16,924
This crypto currency world is the 
ultimate revolution that's going to end 

23
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:21,034
governments and banks.
For others it's just another financial 

24
00:01:23,381 --> 00:01:24,214
bubble.
This will make it easier for criminals 

25
00:01:25,181 --> 00:01:27,940
and terrorists to hide their money from 
the police.

26
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:28,863
Unfortunately the reality is way more 
boring than this bitcoin exchange 

27
00:01:35,431 --> 00:01:36,264
reaches deal with Barclays for UK 
transactions but all is on just a 

28
00:01:39,121 --> 00:01:40,920
second.
If you felt cryptic currencies,

29
00:01:40,921 --> 00:01:44,370
but just a strategy to avoid taxes.
I've got some news for you.

30
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:48,330
This municipality

31
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:51,810
of [inaudible] is going to let residents
pay their taxes in bitcoin.

32
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,640
It's mayor has announced,
sorry,

33
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,740
let's start from the beginning.
Shall We?

34
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:01,040
Blockchain?
Blockchain is a technology.

35
00:02:01,061 --> 00:02:04,710
It just like virtual reality or peer to 
peer file sharing is a technology.

36
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:09,150
As with every technology you can use it 
for any different things and one of them

37
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,380
is cryptocurrencies and one of these 
cryptocurrencies,

38
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:13,223
bitcoin and as with many technologies 
you can use it for many different 

39
00:02:16,231 --> 00:02:17,064
things.
One of them is cryptocurrencies and one 

40
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:22,620
of those cryptocurrencies is bitcoin.
But it's not the only one.

41
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,483
Many people think that these new coins 
will substitute legal money that is 

42
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:27,510
dollars,
euros,

43
00:02:27,511 --> 00:02:30,720
or any other currency,
but it doesn't have to be that way.

44
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:31,643
In fact,
cryptocurrencies can do many other 

45
00:02:33,001 --> 00:02:35,400
things and today we're going to have a 
look at some of them.

46
00:02:35,550 --> 00:02:38,940
But now the real question is what is 
blockchain all about?

47
00:02:38,941 --> 00:02:41,850
What is it used for?
And most importantly why,

48
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,920
uh,
banks starting to use it.

49
00:02:44,070 --> 00:02:45,990
Do they were going to answer all of 
these questions,

50
00:02:45,991 --> 00:02:48,210
but before we do,
let's take a look back at their history.

51
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,230
What is blockchain used for?
Look,

52
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:58,170
bitcoin was born in 2009 nonetheless,
the technology that it's based on,

53
00:02:58,171 --> 00:02:59,004
the blockchain was all the way back in 
1991 so let's see how it works without 

54
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:05,020
even mentioning the word.
Yep.

55
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:05,993
Ahead.

56
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:10,673
Body.
We want to do this well because it's 

57
00:03:11,101 --> 00:03:14,490
important to understand the blockchain 
can be used for many other things.

58
00:03:14,491 --> 00:03:17,320
And since this is a complicated matter,
I asked one sec,

59
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:18,173
one of the hosts of the Spanish visual 
politic channel to show it to you by 

60
00:03:20,791 --> 00:03:23,840
drawing,
which is something he can do and I sadly

61
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:24,683
cannot.

62
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,593
All right,
so let me take you back to the example 

63
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:32,170
of the house in San Francisco.
The one that costs one point $3 million.

64
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:33,183
In order to buy it,
you have to sign a contract with the 

65
00:03:34,511 --> 00:03:35,344
owner,
but how do you know that he or she is 

66
00:03:36,491 --> 00:03:39,640
going to meet that agreement?
How do you know that the house exists if

67
00:03:39,641 --> 00:03:41,860
you've never seen it?
In reality,

68
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:45,820
usually we have a trusted third party,
like a notary verifiers.

69
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,370
This notary will verify the house 
exists.

70
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:49,204
Since that you're talking to the real 
owner who is willing to hand over the 

71
00:03:51,791 --> 00:03:52,624
keys when he gets the money.
This is the way that any traditional 

72
00:03:55,181 --> 00:03:56,014
contract works and it has many problems.
First having many parties means that 

73
00:04:02,851 --> 00:04:06,480
there's lots of waiting time and lots of
fees,

74
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,380
but there's an even worse problem here 
if someone hacked the computer of one of

75
00:04:10,381 --> 00:04:13,350
those third parties so you could modify 
the terms of the contract.

76
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,460
This means traditional contracts on not 
as safe as they seem,

77
00:04:17,700 --> 00:04:20,320
and this is where the lock chain enters 
the picture.

78
00:04:20,590 --> 00:04:23,170
In this case,
instead of using a traditional contract,

79
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:25,750
we could use a so called smart contract.

80
00:04:32,390 --> 00:04:33,223
Is that a little bit of software that 
executes automatically when something 

81
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:37,610
happens?
In this case,

82
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:40,670
you could leave your one point $3 
million in a special account.

83
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:44,570
So there's the moment when you open up a
new door of your house as sensible,

84
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,433
notice your presence and boom,
the smart contract will take your 1.3 

85
00:04:48,651 --> 00:04:49,484
million bucks from that special accounts
and send it to the seller in case the 

86
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:54,440
key doesn't work because you've been 
tricked,

87
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,260
then the contract would not execute.
All right,

88
00:04:57,261 --> 00:04:58,094
so all of this sounds pretty great,
but who is going to validate any of 

89
00:05:01,431 --> 00:05:02,210
this?
Well,

90
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:03,043
in this case,
we don't actually need that parties or 

91
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:05,903
middlemen.
There's may need for notaries 

92
00:05:07,011 --> 00:05:08,420
whatsoever.
In this case,

93
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,070
we have a network.

94
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,523
This is a crappy is a company that 
offers a real estate sales 

95
00:05:17,571 --> 00:05:19,610
internationally through blockchain.
Well,

96
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:20,444
in this case,
all the sellers and buyers inside of 

97
00:05:22,131 --> 00:05:24,950
this platform would be nodes of the 
network.

98
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:25,873
And so now you might be wondering,
so I just want to address it really 

99
00:05:27,081 --> 00:05:30,050
quickly.
No company has paid us to do this video.

100
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:31,940
We just used the example of this 
company.

101
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:32,774
So we can give a real life example.
It makes it more tangible and hopefully 

102
00:05:35,271 --> 00:05:36,104
more enjoyable.
So while the great innovation of 

103
00:05:37,521 --> 00:05:41,270
blockchain is that it's users will 
always have a copy of the contract.

104
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,610
So all of them can be a point of 
verification.

105
00:05:43,670 --> 00:05:47,870
And in case one copy does not match the 
copy of another node system,

106
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,330
we'll consider this to be fought.
But yeah,

107
00:05:50,331 --> 00:05:51,164
but not only that,
this contract will always be stored and 

108
00:05:53,981 --> 00:05:55,270
what we call a block.

109
00:05:58,540 --> 00:05:59,373
Okay.

110
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:02,920
And this book at the same time will be 
stored in a chain of blocks.

111
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,830
This is why we call this system 
blockchain.

112
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:08,560
So if a hacker wants to modify our 
contract,

113
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,483
he would have to get into all of the 
computers from the members of our 

114
00:06:12,461 --> 00:06:15,160
blockchain all at the same time.
As you can imagine,

115
00:06:15,161 --> 00:06:15,994
this is way harder than getting into one
computer and no matter how secure that 

116
00:06:19,571 --> 00:06:21,310
computer is,
and now you might be wondering,

117
00:06:21,311 --> 00:06:24,430
so anytime I start using some blockchain
service,

118
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,293
will they have all the registers and 
transactions that have been done in 

119
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
Sinus?
And the answer is,

120
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,120
well,
yeah.

121
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,100
In fact,
if you want to have a bitcoin,

122
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:35,620
you should download all of the 
blockchain,

123
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,860
which is now over 160 gigabytes

124
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:45,980
and now I can get many of you saying,
well come on sign.

125
00:06:45,981 --> 00:06:48,140
And that's not true.
I've got a bit coin while there's a nice

126
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,970
enough to download 160 gigabytes or 
stuff.

127
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,630
Well actually of course you do.
In your case for you or what you have is

128
00:06:54,631 --> 00:06:55,464
actually a light coin.
This means that another person 

129
00:06:57,091 --> 00:06:57,924
downloaded those 160 gigabytes and now 
that person is letting you use bitcoin 

130
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,470
through his or has server.
This said,

131
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,363
blockchain is starting to be used for 
all kinds of things as you have already 

132
00:07:08,431 --> 00:07:09,264
seen.
Some companies offer real estate deals 

133
00:07:10,771 --> 00:07:13,110
with smart contracts,
but there are many,

134
00:07:13,111 --> 00:07:16,290
many other applications.
You can even have a website hosting with

135
00:07:16,291 --> 00:07:17,124
blockchain so then he can hear it.
US inside of a network would have the 

136
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:20,484
data,
other companies offer medical record 

137
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:23,100
storage,
et Cetera,

138
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,600
et Cetera,
but okay,

139
00:07:24,601 --> 00:07:27,840
we've already told you what blockchain 
is all about.

140
00:07:27,870 --> 00:07:28,703
Now there is a second part and that is,
well what do banks have to do with all 

141
00:07:32,821 --> 00:07:34,670
of this and that's something we're going
to look at,

142
00:07:34,710 --> 00:07:35,543
right?

143
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:40,030
Survival

144
00:07:40,030 --> 00:07:42,640
of the fittest.
If there is one thing that generates all

145
00:07:42,641 --> 00:07:47,440
kinds of gossip and mixed signals and 
conspiracy theories,

146
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,303
it's crypto currencies.
You just need to google the name of any 

147
00:07:50,651 --> 00:07:51,484
famous company followed by the word 
crypto currency and you've got some 

148
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:54,754
blogs that claims that this farm wants 
to get its own crypto coin or the 

149
00:07:57,341 --> 00:07:59,620
opposite or both things.
At the same time,

150
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:00,783
there's information.
Noise is so pervasive that it is almost 

151
00:08:03,371 --> 00:08:04,204
impossible to separate the wheat from 
the chaff and this is also a heads up 

152
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:09,850
for you guys.
He might want to start investing in this

153
00:08:09,851 --> 00:08:11,050
industry.
Watch out.

154
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,520
I'm not telling you,
not to you,

155
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:16,720
but be careful because there is a lot of
hype and this is why to do this video.

156
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:17,554
We talked straight to the sources so 
that we could corroborate that this is 

157
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:24,640
true.
Dbva an intro.

158
00:08:24,641 --> 00:08:27,730
We'll make the world's first blockchain 
based corporate loan.

159
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:28,653
In this case,
Indra is a Spanish engineering company 

160
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,384
and bb Va is a large Spanish bank.
The idea is pretty similar to what we 

161
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:35,494
said about the house in San Francisco 
and this case bb va signs a contract 

162
00:08:39,101 --> 00:08:39,934
with Indra and to all the members inside
of the blockchain will have a copy of 

163
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:46,600
the same.
So what's the advantage of all this?

164
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:48,760
Well,
it would prevent internal corruption.

165
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:49,623
Some people might want to exaggerate the
cost of some building in order to get 

166
00:08:52,271 --> 00:08:53,104
her money into their pockets,
but if they have a smart and everybody 

167
00:08:56,491 --> 00:09:00,240
has a copy of this,
then they can track every transaction.

168
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,163
This means that both the company and the
bank are protecting themselves from the 

169
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:05,063
iron workers,
but we are only talking about loans 

170
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:08,580
here.
As we said before,

171
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:12,870
blockchain can be used for many other 
things and apparently Spanish banks,

172
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:15,210
they want to pioneer this.
Here's another example.

173
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:19,540
Sorry

174
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:22,000
Tom Dare to launch the first blockchain 
base.

175
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:24,160
International money transfer service.

176
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:28,510
In this case we are talking again about 
a reducing verification times.

177
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,510
You see anytime you make an 
international money transfer,

178
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:34,300
you have lots of intermediary banks.
For instance,

179
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:35,134
if you want to send $1,000 to a friend 
in Germany or somebody has to verify 

180
00:09:37,811 --> 00:09:42,811
that you have $1,000 less and your 
friend has $1,000 more after this,

181
00:09:43,211 --> 00:09:46,960
the problems from the currency exchange 
and you have lots of intermediaries that

182
00:09:46,961 --> 00:09:51,130
need to be in contact and verify every 
step of the process.

183
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:53,530
Companies like a ripple used blockchain 
to do this.

184
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,453
In a matter of seconds,
and this is why it Santown death will 

185
00:09:56,921 --> 00:10:00,570
now stop making international transfers 
from one day to the other.

186
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:01,643
In fact,
both Santander and bb va has been 

187
00:10:03,601 --> 00:10:06,090
investing in cryptocurrency companies 
for years.

188
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:11,123
Main European banks have all been part 
of blockchain platforms for years from 

189
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:15,614
we trade to the Spanish Alaska area.
But how big of future do these projects 

190
00:10:18,891 --> 00:10:20,660
have?
You simply don't know,

191
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:21,643
but clearly there's an interest from 
traditional banks to not miss out on 

192
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:26,450
these kinds of new technologies.

193
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,860
And now I know what you might be 
thinking.

194
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:31,580
So far we've just talked about faster 
transactions and safe a contract.

195
00:10:31,581 --> 00:10:33,290
It's nothing super exciting,
right?

196
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:37,010
So where is that revolution that some 
people are talking about?

197
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,060
Well,
believe me,

198
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,610
there is certainly a potential 
revolution here,

199
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,890
but we're going to talk about that in 
the coming week.

200
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,373
Send me

201
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:48,553

And that was your,
so far we talked about banks using 

204
00:10:55,381 --> 00:10:58,140
blockchain technology.
What about cryptocurrencies?

205
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,280
Yeah,
Barclay's,

206
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:00,031
yes,
indeed.

207
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:02,940
Barclays is offering services in 
Bitcoin,

208
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,190
but will they use it as a normal thing?
Well,

209
00:11:05,191 --> 00:11:08,610
we see all kinds of new services,
thanks to cryptocurrencies.

210
