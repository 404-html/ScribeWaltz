1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,560
I'm going to stop this episode with a 
question and please don't treat him.

2
00:00:11,561 --> 00:00:12,394
Please don't Google the answer.
What is the country with the biggest 

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:18,490
chance of female politicians insight 
it's parliaments.

4
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:19,900
It might be thinking right now,
Norway,

5
00:00:19,901 --> 00:00:21,550
Sweden,
maybe Great Britain.

6
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:22,870
Well,
if that's the case,

7
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:24,910
your thinking is wrong because the 
answer,

8
00:00:24,940 --> 00:00:25,773
it's actually Rwanda,
one of the poorest places in Subsaharan 

9
00:00:29,110 --> 00:00:29,943
Africa.

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:34,400
I'm sure many of you already know this 
country,

11
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,720
yet least those of you who are as old as
me,

12
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:39,660
because in the end of 1994,
the Rwandan genocide,

13
00:00:39,690 --> 00:00:42,570
it appears on every news station around 
the world.

14
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:47,400
It was one of the biggest atrocities in 
mankind's history in just 100 days.

15
00:00:47,401 --> 00:00:50,520
There are ones in governments brutally 
killed almost a million people.

16
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:54,750
This meant that every one in five 
Rwandans was murdered for decades.

17
00:00:54,751 --> 00:00:55,584
Rwanda.
It was the synonym for humanitarian 

18
00:00:57,001 --> 00:00:58,620
catastrophe,
starvation,

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,070
and it was a memory of the darkest side 
of the human condition.

20
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:04,320
Nonetheless,
23 years later in the year,

21
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,154
2017,
Rwanda is turning into something much 

22
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:08,694
difference

23
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,960
is from Rwanda investing in one of the 
world's fastest growing economies.

24
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:16,370
Yep.
You heard that rides,

25
00:01:16,371 --> 00:01:19,870
Rwanda is becoming a hot topic in the 
financial world,

26
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,510
a country that used to appear on 
humanitarian aid commercials.

27
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:24,463
Now he's starting to fill financial 
newspapers and it's President Paul 

28
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:28,583
Kagame has become the new African 
rockstar being received a prestigious 

29
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:34,310
places like Harvard or the Brookings 
Institution.

30
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:35,150
Yes,
of course.

31
00:01:35,150 --> 00:01:39,410
Everyone does agree that it style is 
kind of areas and winning elections with

32
00:01:39,440 --> 00:01:42,680
over 96 percent of the vote doesn't 
exactly sound democratic,

33
00:01:42,681 --> 00:01:43,760
does it?
I mean,

34
00:01:43,761 --> 00:01:44,594
despite all of that,
you can judge a man that he's taking 

35
00:01:46,131 --> 00:01:46,964
Rwanda out of poverty.
The figures speak for themselves since 

36
00:01:49,581 --> 00:01:50,414
Paul Kagame came into power Rwandans to 
triple their income and the percentage 

37
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:56,320
of the population that lives in extreme 
poverty is reducing gear.

38
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,750
Now,
the question is,

39
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,613
how did Rwanda end up like this?
Or perhaps maybe this is too good to be 

40
00:02:06,041 --> 00:02:06,874
true.
I just the some detail we're missing 

41
00:02:08,591 --> 00:02:09,700
here today.
Well,

42
00:02:09,701 --> 00:02:12,430
we are going to answer those questions 
before we do.

43
00:02:12,431 --> 00:02:14,650
As usual.
Let's take a look back at the history.

44
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:15,790
I'm.
Trust me,

45
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:18,370
this one is pretty intense.

46
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,040
Fabricated hatred.
Remember this date,

47
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,540
April the sixth,
19,

48
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:26,433
94 on this date,
the plane the Rwandan president was 

49
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:31,370
flying in was hit spine anti aircraft 
gun

50
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:36,390
I

51
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:37,223
the notes who organized this attack,
but the ones an army soldiers belong to 

52
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:43,950
the Hutu trolley,
blames that rival the Tutsis.

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,873
Tutsis were a minority inside ruins.
They're living in an apartheid 

54
00:02:47,371 --> 00:02:48,204
situation.
Local media referred to them as 

55
00:02:49,411 --> 00:02:50,244
cockroaches,
and many of them had already escaped to 

56
00:02:52,051 --> 00:02:55,980
refugee camps in neighboring countries,
but no one could have predicted that the

57
00:02:55,981 --> 00:02:59,220
mounting prejudice would have unleashed 
such carnage

58
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,453
bottle.

59
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,640
What messages like this with broadcast 
on the radio,

60
00:03:38,730 --> 00:03:42,330
there are one's an army was passing out 
clubs and machetes to civilians.

61
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:46,440
If any of those who to civilians showed 
mercy to his or her tootsie neighbors,

62
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:49,680
he or she would risk being executed as a
collaborator.

63
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,910
Explains why many Rwandans clubs there,
tootsie wives to death,

64
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:59,610
and 20.
Even some Catholic churches became human

65
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:00,453
slaughterhouses in just 100 days.
Nearly a million people died by their 

66
00:04:03,651 --> 00:04:04,500
neighbors.
Machete.

67
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:09,263
Well,
now you might be wondering why did the 

68
00:04:10,171 --> 00:04:11,004
Hutus hate the Tutsi so much with a 
really that different and while the 

69
00:04:14,251 --> 00:04:15,990
answer is you expect is,
nope,

70
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:27,243
you see many African countries have lots
of different cultures and races living 

71
00:04:29,981 --> 00:04:31,210
together.
South Africa,

72
00:04:31,211 --> 00:04:33,400
for example,
has nine official languages.

73
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:38,550
Your guns or it's over $50.
Nonetheless,

74
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:43,870
Rwanda and territory with surprisingly 
homogenous for centuries,

75
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:48,520
one single language on a single culture,
the Hutus and Tutsis and other tribes,

76
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:51,760
they lived in relative harmony in the 
20th century,

77
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,623
Belgium colonized this country,
one of the first policies made by the 

78
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:56,044
Belgian government was to force the 
locals to label themselves according to 

79
00:04:58,751 --> 00:05:01,540
the tribe they belonged to.
This way,

80
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,690
it would be easier for the colonizers to
identify who was who,

81
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,613
and during the first years the Tutsis 
were the tribe in charge of government 

82
00:05:11,261 --> 00:05:14,050
institutions created by the Belgians.
Then one's eight,

83
00:05:14,110 --> 00:05:16,240
those Tutsis started asking for 
independent,

84
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:17,103
and that's when Belgian started 
supporting the Hutus with racist 

85
00:05:19,361 --> 00:05:20,194
propaganda.
This is how when Rwanda became a 

86
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:22,624
sovereign state in 1962,
Hutus and Tutsis had already become 

87
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:27,400
fierce enemies.
That hatred,

88
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:32,110
it was fabricated by the colonizers and 
many Tutsis had to flee to refugee camps

89
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:32,944
in neighboring countries.
Among them was the man that you see on 

90
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:41,660
the screen now,
pull Kagomi,

91
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,573
now remember his name,
because it will be the key figure in 

92
00:05:44,381 --> 00:05:45,780
this story.
We'll look at Goldman.

93
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:48,850
He was raised on one of those 
aforementioned refugee camps.

94
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,040
This one,
it was situated in Uganda.

95
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:53,850
It was the beginning of the 19 eighties 
back then Uganda.

96
00:05:53,851 --> 00:05:54,684
Ganzer was in the middle of a civil war 
and Kagomi along with other Rwandan 

97
00:05:57,441 --> 00:06:00,500
refugees for to the Ugandan government 
and they want,

98
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:09,200
and this is how to army as a military.
Legend was born in the 19 nineties.

99
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:12,650
He would lead other attacks against the 
Hutu lead Rwandan government's,

100
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:17,710
but the turning points was in 1990 for 
100 days after that horrific massacre.

101
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,010
On April the sixth,

102
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,730
Tacoma was making his entrance in 
Kigali,

103
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,920
the Rwandan carbon with 2,500
soldiers.

104
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:32,430
The genocide was over and Rwanda,
it had a new government.

105
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,323
This time it was a Tutsi lead.
Governments with Kagomi serving as the 

106
00:06:35,851 --> 00:06:36,684
vice presidents,
but hold on just a second because the 

107
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:41,400
story,
it doesn't just end here because imagine

108
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:42,234
the scenario for one,
he had to help lead a divided country 

109
00:06:44,251 --> 00:06:45,084
where genocide survivors how to live 
next to the neighbors that had killed 

110
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:48,430
their friends

111
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:49,263
family.

112
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,293
I didn't tell that Rwanda was one of the
10 poorest countries on earth with few 

113
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:59,250
resources to export,
and on top of all of that,

114
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:00,263
this brand new tootsie government was 
not an example of transparency and 

115
00:07:03,301 --> 00:07:06,060
respect for human rights.
As you can imagine,

116
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:08,190
many of the soldiers who had taken over 
Kigali,

117
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,100
they wanted revenge and well during the 
next year,

118
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,880
no one made an effort to stop the 
executions and the unfair trials.

119
00:07:14,910 --> 00:07:15,743
If this wasn't enough,
many ministers trying to use their 

120
00:07:17,371 --> 00:07:18,204
positions to fill their pockets with the
little money that Rwanda hat corruption 

121
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:24,720
certainly on the rise.
Meanwhile for Kagomi had the charisma,

122
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:27,960
the popular support,
and especially the political ambition to

123
00:07:27,961 --> 00:07:31,020
rise even higher.
And this is why in March of 2000,

124
00:07:31,021 --> 00:07:31,854
let Hootsuite,
president resilience man's without an 

125
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,230
election.
Well,

126
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:35,123
the inevitable happens gamay the eternal
president in the year 2000 army became 

127
00:07:43,711 --> 00:07:48,060
the new Rwandan presidents until you 
came to Palo with two clear goals.

128
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,960
The first one was to unify the Rwandan 
people after the genocide.

129
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:54,510
The second was to pull this country out 
of poverty.

130
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:57,810
So what did he do to achieve this goal?
Well,

131
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,703
he traveled.
You're going to be created an advisory 

132
00:08:04,971 --> 00:08:07,430
team that went to countries like China,
Thailand,

133
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:09,710
and Singapore.
So can you guess what?

134
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:11,690
Those three places,
what do they have in common?

135
00:08:11,750 --> 00:08:12,583
Well,
the answer is that they were countries 

136
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:16,900
that used to be poor.
Back then they were emerging nations.

137
00:08:19,420 --> 00:08:21,580
Kagomi arranged meetings with 
politicians.

138
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:25,280
Economists send civil sevens,
and from these meetings he wrote down at

139
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:26,123
scores of ideas in a notebook.
Then he returns with the golden formula 

140
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:29,973
to build a wealthy country.
This notebook became the foundation for 

141
00:08:32,501 --> 00:08:35,620
the brand new Rwandan constitution,
and more importantly,

142
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,613
vision 20 slash 20,
basically vision 20 slash 20 was it 

143
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,750
government development plan launched by 
Paul Kagame,

144
00:08:40,751 --> 00:08:41,584
gummy with the goal of transforming 
wander into a middle income country in 

145
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:45,274
just two days.

146
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:47,900
Modern,

147
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:50,840
peaceful country for extreme poverty no 
longer existed,

148
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,793
but wait just a minute because this 
isn't the normal buzzword filled speech 

149
00:08:54,321 --> 00:08:56,730
of a politician Rwanda's vision 20 slash
20.

150
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:59,880
It had 44.
Clear and accountable goals,

151
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,920
for instance,
except that by the year 20,

152
00:09:01,921 --> 00:09:02,754
21 in every three rooms in this must 
have electricity at home for both the 

153
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,100
governments and private consultancy 
firms.

154
00:09:08,101 --> 00:09:10,910
That analyzing and measuring the 
progress of all of these.

155
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:17,993
Let's take a look as an example.
One of those targets was to make her 

156
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,710
one's at a gender equality haven ends.
Now,

157
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:23,544
the Rwandan constitution requires that 
at least 50 percent of all government 

158
00:09:26,911 --> 00:09:31,911
positions held by women.
In fact,

159
00:09:33,861 --> 00:09:36,050
at the time of making this video,
there are ones in parliament,

160
00:09:36,051 --> 00:09:36,884
has the biggest share of female mps in 
the entire world and to the wage gap 

161
00:09:40,551 --> 00:09:45,020
between men and women is lower than in 
countries as progressive as Denmark.

162
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:46,123
Today,
there is a brand new generation of 

163
00:09:47,631 --> 00:09:48,464
female Rwandan entrepreneurs leading the
country and what's more Rwanda is 

164
00:09:55,001 --> 00:09:58,810
investing the small amounts of money 
they collected in taxes pretty wisely in

165
00:09:58,811 --> 00:09:59,644
a country where 80 percent of its 
population used to live off subsistence 

166
00:10:02,231 --> 00:10:04,840
farming.
The government is built power generators

167
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,870
and roads that increase agricultural 
productivity.

168
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:11,260
Now we're ones in farmers are beginning 
to export food to their neighbors.

169
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,970
All of this explains why 23 years after 
the genocide,

170
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:23,500
Rwanda GDP is growing at an average rate
of eight percent a year.

171
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:24,513
This is similar to emerging economies 
like China or Vietnam on the same 

172
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:31,360
streets where in 1994 people were 
clubbing each other to death.

173
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:34,210
Startups like Rwanda motorcycle company 
are being born.

174
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:38,350
The motorcycle factory was created this 
year in 2017 with American investment.

175
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:40,540
If you want to start a company in 
neighboring countries,

176
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:43,930
you will need weeks or even months to 
deal with all the paperwork in Rwanda.

177
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:45,940
You're done with all that in just two 
days.

178
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:46,863
As of course,
this has attracted a lot of foreign 

179
00:10:48,911 --> 00:10:51,970
investors,
especially from China and America,

180
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:54,700
and so now you might be wondering how 
did they end up here?

181
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,990
Once Polka gummies secrets welded,
you have the answer.

182
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:03,010
It has a light side,
but it also has a dark side at gunpoint.

183
00:11:05,410 --> 00:11:07,120
Everyone believes it.
Rwanda works.

184
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:10,590
Streets are safe and tolerance between 
Hutus and Tutsis is imposed vinyl.

185
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:11,533
No,

186
00:11:14,990 --> 00:11:15,823
no one's in constitution itself forbids 
the use of the words Tutsi and Hutus to 

187
00:11:19,641 --> 00:11:20,474
refer to a person according to the 
government or citizens are Rwandans and 

188
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:26,270
no one should care about their tribe of 
origin.

189
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:29,900
Either the media nor institutions are 
allowed to say anything that could spark

190
00:11:29,930 --> 00:11:34,130
hatred or open past scars and well,
in fact,

191
00:11:34,131 --> 00:11:36,350
they call it even criticize the 
governance.

192
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:39,770
Both the police and the military.
They are present all over the country to

193
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:42,500
make sure that everyone follows these 
laws.

194
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,401
Yeah,
it is true.

195
00:11:43,401 --> 00:11:44,234
Balking on me is a popular presidents in
dd has his own youtube channel and to 

196
00:11:47,150 --> 00:11:49,790
twitter and facebook account that he 
uses almost daily,

197
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:53,620
but no one else has the freedom to 
express their ideas freely.

198
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,413
Well,
the same goes for other political 

199
00:11:59,081 --> 00:12:01,120
parties.
We're talking about the president.

200
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:05,530
He's been in power for 17 years and he 
wins elections with outcomes higher than

201
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:08,280
95 percent of the votes.
As you can imagine,

202
00:12:08,370 --> 00:12:10,570
you is not exactly democratic.

203
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,350
One of his opponents,
friend Kevin,

204
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:13,493
the only permitted opposition party 
hailed the process he had attempted to 

205
00:12:17,571 --> 00:12:20,800
run for the 2010 presidential election 
party,

206
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:22,910
was unable to register for the vote.

207
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:24,003
In other words,
the Rwandan model is based on three 

208
00:12:25,541 --> 00:12:26,830
pillars,
ease of investing,

209
00:12:26,831 --> 00:12:27,664
and doing business infrastructure 
developments and at the top an 

210
00:12:30,041 --> 00:12:33,780
authoritarian governments,
they'd guarantee safety and tolerance at

211
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:35,340
the expense of other human rights.

212
00:12:39,170 --> 00:12:40,720
Now we want to know what your opinion 
is.

213
00:12:40,721 --> 00:12:43,420
Do you think that this lack of democracy
is legitimate?

214
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:47,260
If the country can step out of poverty 
or perhaps Rhonda would be better off if

215
00:12:47,261 --> 00:12:50,290
they structured the country in a more 
democratic in Western model?

216
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,230
What?
