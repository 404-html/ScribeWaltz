1
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:08,733
I think there's one thing here we can 
all agree on the Internet has certainly 

2
00:00:11,110 --> 00:00:14,650
changed our lives so much so that 
according to statistics,

3
00:00:14,651 --> 00:00:19,120
three out of every four Americans can't 
imagine life without music,

4
00:00:19,121 --> 00:00:20,060
news,
shopping ads,

5
00:00:20,061 --> 00:00:22,150
especially video services such as this 
platform.

6
00:00:22,151 --> 00:00:22,984
Youtube have huge amounts of data 
flowing through them every day and it 

7
00:00:26,561 --> 00:00:27,670
just keeps growing.

8
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,710
Yeah,

9
00:00:31,930 --> 00:00:32,763
that would be a plan for the Amazon is 
giving the delivery guy spare key all 

10
00:00:40,101 --> 00:00:45,101
the apps,
gps video when classroom connecting with

11
00:00:45,531 --> 00:00:48,680
another one continent in four time zones
away,

12
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,180
initials at the US State Department.
We're so concerned about the anti Muslim

13
00:00:53,181 --> 00:00:55,420
videos that president trump retweeted 
yesterday.

14
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,350
According to Cisco's estimates just in 
the next five years alone,

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,040
the United States will multiply its 
Internet traffic by three.

16
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:13,180
In fact,
in 2015,

17
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:14,014
the United States matched and surpassed 
South Korea becoming the world's leader 

18
00:01:17,231 --> 00:01:19,050
per capita in data consumption.

19
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:19,953
Sure,

20
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:24,213
and of course the Internet's this great 
virtual world is becoming more 

21
00:01:27,121 --> 00:01:27,954
integrated with on lives to making up an
increasingly larger share of our 

22
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:33,390
economic activity.
So based on all of this,

23
00:01:33,391 --> 00:01:38,391
you can probably imagine two things.
First,

24
00:01:39,830 --> 00:01:40,663
the massive amounts of infrastructure 
required by all of this consumption and 

25
00:01:43,760 --> 00:01:47,030
seconds,
how important Internet regulation is.

26
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:49,550
Well,
on the 14th of December 2017,

27
00:01:49,551 --> 00:01:50,384
the federal communications commission of
the United States made a decision that 

28
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:53,924
could well be described as historic due 
to its transcendence and above all it's 

29
00:01:57,921 --> 00:02:00,170
controversy.
As you may know,

30
00:02:00,171 --> 00:02:01,004
the Federal Communications Commission 
decided by three votes against two to 

31
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:05,503
end so-called net neutrality.
No one really is sure what will happen 

32
00:02:09,531 --> 00:02:12,890
now that the government has changed the 
rules governing the worldwide.

33
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,190
This regulation was approved in 2015 at 
the request of President Obama himself.

34
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:24,390
Yup,
you heard that right?

35
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:25,224
The regulation known as net neutrality 
was born in 2015 within a short time 

36
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,233
twisted the media and practically every 
debate space was covered with this 

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,320
message with facing the end of the 
Internet.

38
00:02:37,410 --> 00:02:38,243
As we know.

39
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:43,770
By the way,
this man is a GPI chairman of the United

40
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:45,390
States is federal communications 
commission.

41
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,690
And this story is main protagonists or 
we could say antagonist.

42
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:49,583
What we've decided is that we need to 
restore the light touch market based 

43
00:02:52,921 --> 00:02:54,960
framework that started in the 19 
nineties.

44
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:58,890
He is also probably one of the most 
hated people on the Internet.

45
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:01,090
Well then maybe a couple of questions 
that we need to answer here.

46
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:01,953
First,
what was this regulation fundamentally 

47
00:03:03,611 --> 00:03:07,090
about and seconds,
what does this change really mean?

48
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:12,430
What am I going to do in DC?
For two years,

49
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:16,530
CNC,
thousand and 15,

50
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,373
it was decided that the Internet would 
pass from being regulated by the first 

51
00:03:20,021 --> 00:03:23,140
title of the communications locked to 
the second title.

52
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,250
Well,
that doesn't really help us,

53
00:03:24,251 --> 00:03:26,600
so what does that mean?
Well,

54
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,800
so you understand this better.
We could say that with this change,

55
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:30,643
the Internet,
that is the service provision starting 

56
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:33,274
to be considered a public service and to
be strongly regulated by the government 

57
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:37,143
in this case,
by the Federal Communications 

58
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:39,290
Commission.

59
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,123
Ever since the Internet was created,
it's been organized around basic 

60
00:03:43,221 --> 00:03:45,140
principles of openness,
fairness,

61
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:47,210
and freedom.
This set of principles,

62
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,403
the idea of net and Trello,
it has unleashed the power of the 

63
00:03:50,721 --> 00:03:53,510
Internet and given innovators that 
chance to thrive,

64
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,613
abandoning these principles would 
threaten to end the internet as we know 

65
00:03:57,741 --> 00:03:58,020
it.

66
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,100
This is a regulation that among other 
things prevented American operators such

67
00:04:01,101 --> 00:04:02,250
as call Mecosta,
verizon,

68
00:04:02,251 --> 00:04:04,770
or atnt,
from being able to on the one hand block

69
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:07,350
or slow down certain web spaces or 
applications.

70
00:04:07,351 --> 00:04:08,184
Traffic ends on the other,
prevents other content providers from 

71
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:12,030
being preferred.

72
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,410
They should make it clear that whether 
you use a computer,

73
00:04:14,470 --> 00:04:15,303
phone,
or tablet,

74
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,293
Internet providers have a legal 
obligation not to block or limit your 

75
00:04:19,151 --> 00:04:20,140
access to a website.

76
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:21,073
Imagine if a company decided to give 
priority to Netflix over hbo or a 

77
00:04:24,311 --> 00:04:27,740
company that told spotify they needed to
pay if they wanted their customers to be

78
00:04:27,741 --> 00:04:30,110
able to use their music services at high
school

79
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,973
speed

80
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,213
with this regulation,
companies at once able to charge fees 

81
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:38,050
that didn't include access to a certain 
service.

82
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,040
Imagine,
for example,

83
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:39,903
if a business wants at a high speed 
connection that didn't consume netflix 

84
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:43,983
prime video or hbo videos,
it wouldn't matter because with this 

85
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:49,450
previous regulation that have to pay for
the entire service,

86
00:04:49,451 --> 00:04:52,790
the operators wouldn't be able to offer 
a rate without nationally

87
00:04:52,870 --> 00:04:53,703
x

88
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:55,610
interview.
Uh,

89
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:57,920
this has all changed in the United 
States.

90
00:04:57,921 --> 00:05:00,110
Companies can now freely determine their
rates.

91
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,973
For example,
by offering an internet that doesn't 

92
00:05:02,601 --> 00:05:04,700
include being able to watch four k 
videos.

93
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:06,290
Now,
this doesn't mean that they will,

94
00:05:06,291 --> 00:05:10,460
but we will probably see different rates
and merge and it is basically this which

95
00:05:10,461 --> 00:05:13,070
caused such controversy on the Internet.

96
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:22,530
It was so cool

97
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:23,363
virtual that only 107 out of the 239 
Republican congressmen in the House of 

98
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:30,380
Representatives have made their support 
for this decision public.

99
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,660
But do you think this is really that 
bad?

100
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:35,390
Do you think that the Internet will no 
longer be the same?

101
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,253
Well,
in this video we want to show you the 

102
00:05:36,681 --> 00:05:40,400
various arguments for and against net 
neutrality,

103
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:51,500
Internet threat.
Let's have a look at the dark side.

104
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,790
The reasons why net neutrality defenders
consider this change to be so negative,

105
00:05:55,850 --> 00:05:59,060
these points aren't by fascinating,
so it won't take very long.

106
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:04,620
Those who detracts from the change that 
the Republican Party promoted base their

107
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,463
position on two key arguments first that
given that operators can now charge 

108
00:06:09,331 --> 00:06:10,164
extra to both companies and customers,
the cost of the Internet will go up in 

109
00:06:12,901 --> 00:06:13,734
many small businesses and startups won't
be able to compete with the larger ones 

110
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,063
because they won't be able to pay for 
preferential access seconds because it 

111
00:06:19,891 --> 00:06:22,890
involves the ends of the freedom on 
which the Internet was built.

112
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:23,783
Imagine if an operator decided to slow 
down or even block access to a means of 

113
00:06:26,791 --> 00:06:28,200
communication.
Theoretically,

114
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,760
this could now happen.

115
00:06:30,750 --> 00:06:31,583
Our Internet economy is the envy of the 
world because it is open to all this 

116
00:06:34,531 --> 00:06:35,364
proposal.
Tears at the foundation of that 

117
00:06:36,601 --> 00:06:38,790
openness,
enhanced broadband providers.

118
00:06:38,791 --> 00:06:41,070
The power to decide what voices to 
amplify,

119
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,710
which sites we can visit,
what connections we can make,

120
00:06:43,770 --> 00:06:47,040
and what communities we create.
It throttles access stalls,

121
00:06:47,041 --> 00:06:48,900
opportunity and sensors.
Content.

122
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,153
Jessica Rosenworcel,
member of the Federal Communications 

123
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:53,330
Commission bus

124
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,163
probably well versed on these arguments 
already considering how often they've 

125
00:06:56,901 --> 00:06:58,700
been used in the media.
How do they view?

126
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:00,410
As you probably know that here are 
visual politic.

127
00:07:00,411 --> 00:07:01,244
We'd like to dig a little deeper so this
time we also wanted to take a look at 

128
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:06,380
the net neutralities detractors side 
saying,

129
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,310
well,
let's go for it

130
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,013
also cow.

131
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:22,910
Those who support ending so called net 
neutrality have a clear perspective,

132
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,773
a very competitive market as the best 
driver for innovation and ensuring good 

133
00:07:26,631 --> 00:07:30,370
customer service,
and one thing is certain.

134
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:34,230
Literally the Internet emerged.
It grew and developed fundamentally as a

135
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:38,340
free space without the regulation known 
as net neutrality.

136
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,113
This is what Marc Andreessen,
netscape co founder and a key figure in 

137
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:46,490
facebook's birth says on the subjects.

138
00:07:47,380 --> 00:07:50,060
A pure net neutrality view is difficult 
to sustain.

139
00:07:50,061 --> 00:07:53,240
If you also want to have continued 
investment in broadband networks.

140
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,560
If you have these pure net neutrality 
rules,

141
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,470
Rican never charge a company like 
Netflix.

142
00:07:57,471 --> 00:08:00,440
Anything.
You're not ever going to get a return on

143
00:08:00,441 --> 00:08:03,230
continued network investment,
which means you'll stop investing in the

144
00:08:03,231 --> 00:08:04,064
network and it would not want to be 
sitting here 10 or 20 years from now 

145
00:08:06,841 --> 00:08:09,050
with the same broadband speeds we're 
getting today.

146
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:11,810
Marc Andreessen medscapes cofounder.

147
00:08:11,990 --> 00:08:12,823
Yes.
This is one of the main criticisms they 

148
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,164
have used to support this change.
Regulation discourages companies from 

149
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,260
investing as we've seen before.
Internet traffic in the U,

150
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:26,780
s has grown from Mendocino and recent 
years.

151
00:08:26,781 --> 00:08:27,614
How surprisingly investments in 
broadband infrastructure has stagnated 

152
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:33,470
and even decreased in the same span of 
time.

153
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,510
This obviously isn't normal and it fuels
one of the sectors,

154
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:46,410
main problems in the United States,
and that's a lack of competition in many

155
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,244
parts,

156
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:56,790
but of course,
if regulation

157
00:08:56,820 --> 00:08:59,730
hinders and reduces the business's 
potential profitability,

158
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,090
investment incentives are also 
substantially reduced.

159
00:09:03,190 --> 00:09:04,290
It's pretty logical,
right?

160
00:09:04,350 --> 00:09:07,470
Another points claims by those 
supporting the end to Obama's regulation

161
00:09:07,471 --> 00:09:10,440
is that regulation could not only hurt 
investments,

162
00:09:10,441 --> 00:09:12,960
but it was also completely unnecessary.

163
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,800
Twenty years,
the Internet has thrived under the light

164
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:17,634
touch regulatory approach established by
President Clinton and a Republican 

165
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,264
Congress.
This bipartisan framework with the 

166
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,664
private sector to invest one point 5 
trillion building communications 

167
00:09:26,551 --> 00:09:27,384
networks throughout the United States 
and it gave us an internet economy that 

168
00:09:29,971 --> 00:09:32,310
became the envy of the world at Gte pie

169
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,263
according to the supporters in the 20 
years before net neutrality that is 

170
00:09:36,211 --> 00:09:37,044
between 1995 and 2015.
Internet access only expanded and 

171
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:45,450
improved in speed and quality.
Around this time.

172
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:47,400
The big digital companies we know today,
Google,

173
00:09:47,401 --> 00:09:48,420
facebook,
Netflix,

174
00:09:48,450 --> 00:09:49,620
Uber,
they emerged.

175
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:50,431
In fact,
it's funny,

176
00:09:50,431 --> 00:09:53,940
but operators haven't really been the 
big winners of the Internet's birth,

177
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,880
for example,
Alphabet Inc,

178
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,773
Google's parent company as a stock 
market value that's quite a bit bigger 

179
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,653
than the combined value of the three 
largest telecommunications operators in 

180
00:10:04,441 --> 00:10:09,441
the United States.
That for net neutrality to is wonder why

181
00:10:09,691 --> 00:10:12,750
change something that has worked so well
since its inception.

182
00:10:12,810 --> 00:10:16,290
When is an operator restricted access to
a means of communication?

183
00:10:16,291 --> 00:10:18,710
For example,
g mail in facts,

184
00:10:18,711 --> 00:10:19,544
and this is what they use as an example.
The only time something similar happens 

185
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,123
was when comcast trying to block peer to
peer connections to stop illegal 

186
00:10:25,621 --> 00:10:26,640
downloads.
In the end,

187
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:30,390
they have to back down because of bad 
publicity and pressure from authorities,

188
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,690
but,
and this is the third point here,

189
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,960
less regulation does not mean anarchy.
In fact,

190
00:10:36,961 --> 00:10:37,794
from now on in the United States,
the Internet will be regulated by the 

191
00:10:39,841 --> 00:10:40,674
powerful Federal Trade Commission,
which is in charge of the antitrust 

192
00:10:43,741 --> 00:10:44,574
policy,
and operators will also have to comply 

193
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:50,700
with a strict transparency policy.
They will have to communicate any policy

194
00:10:50,701 --> 00:10:54,930
that restricts or favors access speed to
any digital service.

195
00:10:55,900 --> 00:10:57,790
There's the sky's not going to fall 
down.

196
00:10:57,910 --> 00:10:58,743
The FTC is going to be a vigorous cop on
the beat as it has been with respect to 

197
00:11:02,051 --> 00:11:04,300
the Internet providers.
John Liebowitz,

198
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:06,490
former Obama era,
FTC chairman,

199
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:07,453
well reform advocates proposed two 
examples of how the market can evolve 

200
00:11:10,131 --> 00:11:13,100
without net neutrality.
One is the mobile phone markets,

201
00:11:13,101 --> 00:11:17,270
which is much more competitive and it's 
always been at the limits of legality.

202
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,923
The advocates say that in this extra 
users have seen reductions in their 

203
00:11:22,941 --> 00:11:24,920
rates.
While the services have improved.

204
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:25,783
Nowadays,
there are promotions that include 

205
00:11:26,631 --> 00:11:30,320
unlimited access to services such as 
Netflix without data consumption,

206
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:35,350
which clearly violates the spirits of 
and the second example they usually give

207
00:11:36,351 --> 00:11:40,610
is curiously founds in airlines,
particularly the company jet blue.

208
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,593
See,
these companies weren't subjected to 

209
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,394
netsuite and you're trying to say,
and in spite of that and having an 

210
00:11:45,051 --> 00:11:48,410
agreement with Amazon's prioritize prime
video consumption on board,

211
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:52,280
they freely decided not to punish other 
services such as HBO.

212
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,793
Our strategy for inflight Wifi is offer 
the best service at the lowest cost to 

213
00:11:57,281 --> 00:11:58,114
as many passengers as possible,
so we're motivated to support all 

214
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:03,220
content in a fair and neutral way.
Mark Dank Berg,

215
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:04,263
chief executive of Viasat Incorporated,
the satellite company that provides jet 

216
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:08,344
blue's internet.
Now we are facing a very complex 

217
00:12:16,981 --> 00:12:17,814
question whether or not you agree with s
and you try to see both detractors and 

218
00:12:20,191 --> 00:12:23,040
opponents may have exaggerated it's 
consequence just a bit,

219
00:12:23,070 --> 00:12:23,903
but I think we're facing the end of the 
incidents and we must not forget that 

220
00:12:25,951 --> 00:12:27,900
consumption tends to protect

221
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,833
freedom.

222
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:32,823
Yes.
Now it is true that large parts of the 

223
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,040
United States,
do you have a serious competition?

224
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:36,874
Problem networks are only available from
one or two companies and there isn't a 

225
00:12:39,641 --> 00:12:42,790
market for choosing an operator,
but fortunately new technologies such as

226
00:12:42,791 --> 00:12:43,624
five g,
which will make more competition 

227
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:46,160
possible,
they seem to be just around the

228
00:12:48,460 --> 00:12:49,030
personally.

229
00:12:49,030 --> 00:12:49,863
I'm left with one wish and that's that 
the internet remains as free as 

230
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:53,350
possible,
but now it's your turn.

231
00:12:53,380 --> 00:12:55,870
What do you think of the end of net 
neutrality?

232
00:12:55,871 --> 00:12:56,704
Well,

we're so concerned about the.
