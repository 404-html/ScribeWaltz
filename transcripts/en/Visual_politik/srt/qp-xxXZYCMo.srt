1
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,580
Is this someone controlling capitalism 
behind the scenes?

2
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:08,940
You've heard about the Reptilians,
the Rothschild family,

3
00:00:08,941 --> 00:00:09,774
even George Soros.
This is one player with much more power 

4
00:00:15,671 --> 00:00:18,940
than any of these guys and nobody's ever
told you about them.

5
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,140
That of course is the government of 
Norway.

6
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:29,700
Yep.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,590
No way is more than just a very,
very rich country.

8
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:37,110
It's governments can have a real sway on
international businesses.

9
00:00:37,180 --> 00:00:39,850
Think I've gotten enough swell at the 
end of this video.

10
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:43,030
You are absolutely going to see where 
I'm coming from.

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,393
No way is the only country on the planet
where say tannic black metal songs are 

12
00:00:55,811 --> 00:00:57,540
on the billboard shots.
Yes.

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,383
My idea of you,
if you ever travel to this country and 

14
00:00:59,771 --> 00:01:02,380
turn up your radio,
you might find yourself not listening to

15
00:01:02,381 --> 00:01:06,190
Taylor swift,
but instead bands like kroger off man or

16
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:11,260
little meister and that famous hit 
titled My ass.

17
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:18,250
Ah,
so yes,

18
00:01:18,251 --> 00:01:21,010
there might be something a little odd 
going on with the music in this country,

19
00:01:21,011 --> 00:01:21,844
but Norway is one of the richest 
countries on the planet's thing in the 

20
00:01:25,151 --> 00:01:28,780
same league as Ireland and Switzerland,
but not only that,

21
00:01:28,781 --> 00:01:30,790
they're also.
One of the most egalitarian,

22
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
this means that the difference between 
the rich and the poor is fairness.

23
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,043
Awesome.

24
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:40,453
That welfare state is big.
That taxes are high and their lifestyle 

25
00:01:43,551 --> 00:01:44,384
is good,
but I'm betting yet already probably 

26
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,174
know this.
What you probably don't know is that 

27
00:01:48,141 --> 00:01:52,040
noise influence on the international 
economy is way bigger than it looks.

28
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,143
Yes,
Norway is behind the scenes of one of 

29
00:01:54,981 --> 00:01:57,350
the biggest corporations on the planet,

30
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:01,890
but

31
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,050
seriously,
don't leave this video right now.

32
00:02:04,051 --> 00:02:05,160
I know what you're thinking and.
No,

33
00:02:05,161 --> 00:02:05,701
no,
no.

34
00:02:05,701 --> 00:02:10,410
This video is most definitely not a 
crossover with Alex Jones use no way.

35
00:02:10,411 --> 00:02:13,230
As a population of less than 5 million 
inhabitants,

36
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:15,810
New York City has more people 
nonetheless.

37
00:02:15,811 --> 00:02:18,360
These 5 million people have big shares 
in the welds.

38
00:02:18,361 --> 00:02:19,830
Major corporations.
Yep.

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:20,723
You heard that right?
The government of Norway has its own 

40
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,033
hedge fund and they are among the main 
shareholders in a lot of companies like 

41
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:27,540
apple,
facebook,

42
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,480
and Tesla knowing might not have a big 
tree,

43
00:02:30,481 --> 00:02:34,560
but they have an army of money ready to 
influence the world's economy.

44
00:02:34,710 --> 00:02:35,990
So the question now is,
well,

45
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,070
why is Norway so rich and powerful?
How to do it now at this point?

46
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:43,400
Yeah,
probably all thinking the same thing and

47
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:47,970
that is probably oil and you are 
actually kind of right.

48
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:51,450
Norway is one of the world's largest oil
producers,

49
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:55,320
but they actually have nothing to do 
with the other oil rich countries.

50
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,610
I mean,
just look at this picture.

51
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,110
You can see the skylines of Riyadh.
Saudi Arabia

52
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:01,043
conversation

53
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:07,160
looks like a Scifi city of the future.
These skyscrapers,

54
00:03:07,230 --> 00:03:09,350
modern buildings and blends.
You have lights.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,410
Now we'll take a look at this picture of
Oslo,

56
00:03:12,411 --> 00:03:13,220
the capital of

57
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,053
Norway.

58
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:17,533
I probably see the difference right now.
If you've been following visual politic 

59
00:03:20,461 --> 00:03:21,294
for a long time,
you already know that having oil is not 

60
00:03:23,451 --> 00:03:25,520
the same as being rich.
In fact,

61
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,110
as you can see on this,
Josh,

62
00:03:27,111 --> 00:03:31,020
Norwegian crude oil is twice as 
expensive to extract a Saudi

63
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:40,660
for a better understanding.
Most of the Norwegian oil comes from the

64
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:43,840
North Sea and these oil beds,
if she had with other countries like the

65
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,870
United Kingdom,
however noise,

66
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:47,290
taking the most advantage of that oil 
wealth.

67
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:48,221
Oh,
okay.

68
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:50,140
Okay.
And I know what you're probably thinking

69
00:03:50,141 --> 00:03:51,050
right now.
Oh,

70
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:54,760
this is another visual politic video 
where Simon tells us how wonderful it is

71
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:58,000
and how rich Norway God by privatizing 
companies,

72
00:03:58,030 --> 00:03:59,800
right rice.
Well,

73
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:02,110
actually this time the story is 
different.

74
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,290
Norway is actually a great example of 
state capitalism.

75
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,820
So now you might be wondering,
well,

76
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:10,360
what exactly is state capitalism?
Why is no way so rich and powerful?

77
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:12,040
11 answer the question,
Simon,

78
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:15,760
and what does it mean for a government 
to invest in the stock market?

79
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:16,743
Well,
do not worry because today we're going 

80
00:04:17,711 --> 00:04:21,280
to answer these questions,
but as always before we do that,

81
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:23,140
let's have a look back at the history,

82
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:29,653
the Dutch disease.
So I do need to be honest here because 

83
00:04:31,851 --> 00:04:34,250
Norway is never exactly been a poor 
country,

84
00:04:34,251 --> 00:04:36,860
but it wasn't exactly always a wealthy 
one either.

85
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,813
In the 19 fifties.
Norwegians enjoyed a lifestyle similar 

86
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:43,280
to that of the French.
This means wealthier than the Spaniards,

87
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:46,700
but poorer than this Swedish neighbors.
And of course the Americans.

88
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:49,300
Back then,
nobody expected Norway to have oil,

89
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:52,070
but well,
things change dramatically.

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:53,473
Nineteen 59 and that moment shell 
started respecting in the North Sea 

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,120
shells in oil company.
In the Netherlands,

92
00:04:59,121 --> 00:05:02,080
and they were looking for potential oil 
beds in the shores of that

93
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:03,003
country.

94
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:07,010
One day,
boom.

95
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:12,050
They found little gas sources and 
whenever that is gas and oil,

96
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,000
so they kept up their exploration and 
this is how one of the biggest oil field

97
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:17,834
in the world was discovered.
An oilfield situated under British 

98
00:05:20,330 --> 00:05:22,580
Norwegian waters.
During the 19 sixties,

99
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:26,600
Sharon got drilling licenses in those 
two countries years later in 1972,

100
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:29,570
the Norwegian government founded its own
oil company.

101
00:05:29,571 --> 00:05:31,400
Stat oil,
fresh.

102
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:36,520
You're married.
Then you start on this.

103
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,770
This is how the North Sea oil boom 
started.

104
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,460
During the 19 seventies,
money flew into this country.

105
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,300
In just three years,
Norwegians doubled their GDP per capita.

106
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,220
All of a sudden the Norwegian dream and 
working in the dinosaur juice industry,

107
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,383
I mean,
who really wants to go fishing for 

108
00:05:54,351 --> 00:05:59,351
salmon when you can make a lot of money 
working with and gas right now,

109
00:06:01,821 --> 00:06:04,160
it all might be sounding pretty 
fantastic to you.

110
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:06,860
Rice.
Well actually it's not.

111
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,330
In fact this phenomenon,
the.

112
00:06:08,331 --> 00:06:09,164
It has a name,
they call it the Dutch disease or the 

113
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,890
cost of natural resources.

114
00:06:18,510 --> 00:06:22,560
Basically anytime the country finds oil 
and its economy goes nuts,

115
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:26,610
the government couldn't waste piles of 
money while still lowering taxes,

116
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:27,503
citizens,
they want to work in the oil industry 

117
00:06:28,651 --> 00:06:31,410
because it's the most profitable.
Well,

118
00:06:31,411 --> 00:06:33,810
what happens next few years you were 
coming in.

119
00:06:34,050 --> 00:06:35,490
Just one thing.
Dinosaur,

120
00:06:35,620 --> 00:06:36,453
Jason,
when you depend so much on a single 

121
00:06:38,251 --> 00:06:39,084
product,
a small change in the market price puts 

122
00:06:41,431 --> 00:06:44,490
the whole country on the verge of 
bankruptcy.

123
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:48,510
This is exactly what's happened in 
Venezuela and what could happen in other

124
00:06:48,511 --> 00:06:52,020
countries like Saudi Arabia or Bahrain,
this.

125
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:55,620
This was the big difference between 
Norway and the United Kingdom.

126
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:00,453
Both countries have labor governments,
but their policies couldn't be more 

127
00:07:03,131 --> 00:07:05,710
different.
In the year 1976,

128
00:07:05,711 --> 00:07:09,160
the UK was in the middle of one of their
worst financial crises.

129
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:12,460
The government couldn't wait to squeeze 
that oil wealth for all.

130
00:07:12,461 --> 00:07:14,110
It was worth Norway.
However,

131
00:07:14,111 --> 00:07:17,770
they had a more stable situation and 
they could wait so well.

132
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,880
What does this mean?
Well,

133
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:22,000
first the government put very strict 
industry regulations in place.

134
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:22,953
Plus,
50 percent of those are eggs had to be 

135
00:07:24,341 --> 00:07:26,290
in the hands of the state owned oil 
company.

136
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:27,423
On the other hand,
foreign companies have to pay a 78 

137
00:07:29,381 --> 00:07:32,560
percent tax on the profits and that's 
not at all.

138
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,780
No Way.
Put a limit on oil production.

139
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,010
Just look at ms dot.
Yeah,

140
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:41,353
yeah.
You can see whether UK kickstarted that 

141
00:07:42,801 --> 00:07:44,600
production.
At the end of the 19 seventies,

142
00:07:44,601 --> 00:07:45,434
the British were already producing more 
than a million and a half barrels a day 

143
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,093
while Norway was still doing a third of 
that during the eighties during the 

144
00:07:51,771 --> 00:07:52,604
Margaret Thatcher administration,
the UK kept pumping oil like there was 

145
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:56,474
no tomorrow while Norway was still 
pretty much relaxed about the 

146
00:07:58,671 --> 00:08:01,730
production.
So what did they achieve by doing this?

147
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:04,850
Norway was keeping the productive 
economy focused on oil,

148
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:07,460
but just wait a minute because there's 
another big difference

149
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,133
you see during the eighties,
Thatcher private domains to British 

150
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:15,403
Petroleum.
Norway's governments by contrast kept 

151
00:08:16,671 --> 00:08:17,504
control of start on even today,
display the company changing its name 

152
00:08:20,031 --> 00:08:20,864
from [inaudible] to Ecuador.
That state still owns 67 percent of the 

153
00:08:23,991 --> 00:08:24,711
fun.
Okay,

154
00:08:24,711 --> 00:08:25,690
so now you might be thinking,
well,

155
00:08:25,691 --> 00:08:26,690
oh my God,
so wait,

156
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,553
noise a socialist country,
but just hold on a second because the 

157
00:08:30,471 --> 00:08:33,410
Norwegian economic system,
it's actually kind of similar to that of

158
00:08:33,411 --> 00:08:37,940
China and this is what experts are 
calling state capitalism.

159
00:08:38,150 --> 00:08:40,880
This means that the state controls a 
good share of the economy,

160
00:08:40,881 --> 00:08:43,340
but it behaves like a big private 
company.

161
00:08:43,910 --> 00:08:45,620
So what does that mean?
Well,

162
00:08:45,650 --> 00:08:50,650
check this out.
The hedge fund country.

163
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:57,570
Now before we continue,
I should make an aside here because this

164
00:08:57,571 --> 00:09:01,500
beautiful romantic and sweet melody or 
hearing right now is the music of end of

165
00:09:01,501 --> 00:09:02,334
it.
A black metal band that's from not from 

166
00:09:04,021 --> 00:09:04,854
Norway.
They're actually from Columbia that it 

167
00:09:06,181 --> 00:09:10,290
sounds just like a Norwegian bands and 
they sent us their music for this video.

168
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,273
If you want to hear more of them,
we haven't linked to their channel in 

169
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:14,370
the description,

170
00:09:14,370 --> 00:09:15,203
the light.

171
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:22,990
All right,
back to our stories.

172
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:24,093
Do you remember the two pictures I 
showed you at the beginning of this 

173
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,351
video?
Well,

174
00:09:26,351 --> 00:09:27,184
the countries like Saudi Arabia,
they used their impressive or wealth to 

175
00:09:29,531 --> 00:09:31,900
live like a hip hop artist on a Friday 
night.

176
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:34,660
However,
the different Norwegian administrations,

177
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:39,100
both labor and conservative have 
measured every last penny they've spent.

178
00:09:39,190 --> 00:09:40,750
And so what does this mean?
Well,

179
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:43,210
that oil wealth and went into a piggy 
bank,

180
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,750
and this is how we go to the year,
1990 in this year,

181
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:49,090
Norwegian parliament,
they realize three things.

182
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,030
One,
they have a lot of savings to all market

183
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,550
prices go up and down and they cannot 
control that.

184
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:55,533
And three,
the best thing they can do is diversify 

185
00:09:58,211 --> 00:10:01,090
their economy as well.
How could they do that?

186
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,490
Well,
how about investing in the stock?

187
00:10:03,830 --> 00:10:04,830
Gotcha.

188
00:10:09,090 --> 00:10:10,350
I have.
So as we say here,

189
00:10:10,351 --> 00:10:12,840
a visual politics.
So it was that insert was done.

190
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:16,800
This is how the government pension fund 
of Norway also known as the oil fund was

191
00:10:16,801 --> 00:10:17,634
created.
This is a hedge fund controlled by the 

192
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,720
Norwegian Central Bank as they might be 
thinking,

193
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:22,501
well,
oh yeah,

194
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,900
but what's so impressive about that,
I mean there are other countries,

195
00:10:24,901 --> 00:10:27,750
but sovereign wealth funds China,
there's Australia,

196
00:10:27,751 --> 00:10:30,810
there's the United Arab Emirates.
And yes,

197
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,673
that is true,
but this is one of the biggest of them 

198
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:38,940
all.
We're talking about more than a trillion

199
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:39,773
American dollars.
This means that if we divide up this 

200
00:10:40,831 --> 00:10:45,831
fund by the entire Norwegian population,
each citizen has more than $200,000

201
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:50,580
invested in stocks,
but this is not the end of the story.

202
00:10:50,730 --> 00:10:51,563
According to the law,
nobody can touch that money for any 

203
00:10:53,730 --> 00:10:54,563
public spending.
This means that the government can only 

204
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,650
use the benefits of the fund,
but never the capital.

205
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,573
And believe me,
we are not talking about a small amount 

206
00:11:01,711 --> 00:11:02,080
of money.

207
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,913
Yeah,

208
00:11:07,540 --> 00:11:11,950
Norway's sovereign wealth fund made 
$130,000,000,000

209
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,780
in one year.
Also,

210
00:11:13,781 --> 00:11:14,614
according to the law,
they cannot invest in their local 

211
00:11:16,001 --> 00:11:19,390
economy only in foreign companies.
This is why today,

212
00:11:19,391 --> 00:11:24,391
Norway holds one point five percent of 
all of the stocks existing in the entire

213
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,410
world.
Now,

214
00:11:26,411 --> 00:11:27,244
of course,
some years are better than others and 

215
00:11:28,331 --> 00:11:29,164
according to many analysts,
the management of the fund is overly 

216
00:11:31,571 --> 00:11:34,090
conservative and it doesn't make as much
money as they could,

217
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:35,133
but the truth is,
Norway doesn't just use this for 

218
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:37,803
diversification.
They all fund is also a political 

219
00:11:40,091 --> 00:11:45,091
weapon.
Norway's 900,

220
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:50,050
$5 billion dollar oil fund flexes its 
shareholder muscles,

221
00:11:50,140 --> 00:11:54,730
world's largest sovereign wealth fund,
opposed 6,700

222
00:11:54,731 --> 00:11:56,320
company resolutions.
Last year,

223
00:11:56,380 --> 00:11:57,213
for example,
every year the Norwegian central bank 

224
00:11:58,931 --> 00:11:59,764
pushes a blacklist with companies that 
they don't invest in for ethical 

225
00:12:02,261 --> 00:12:04,750
reasons.
This includes weapons manufacturers,

226
00:12:04,751 --> 00:12:08,260
tobacco producers and firms involved in 
corruption scandals,

227
00:12:08,350 --> 00:12:10,210
but this is just the beginning.

228
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,103
You see,
having stocks of a publicly traded 

229
00:12:12,341 --> 00:12:13,174
company gives you the right to 
participate in the shareholder's 

230
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:15,873
meetings.
You can vote on corporate decisions and 

231
00:12:17,710 --> 00:12:20,590
even suggest topics for discussion.
The more stocks you have,

232
00:12:20,591 --> 00:12:23,080
the more important you are in those 
meetings.

233
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,220
Is an example.
This past summer 2018,

234
00:12:26,230 --> 00:12:28,930
facebook started in new algorithms to 
filter fake news.

235
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:31,480
They also started to take the wage gap 
seriously.

236
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:34,840
These two decisions,
all the outcome of a shareholder meeting

237
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:37,990
and guess you added those topics in the 
meeting schedule.

238
00:12:38,350 --> 00:12:39,171
Well,
yeah,

239
00:12:39,171 --> 00:12:40,004
it was.
No Way.

240
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:42,070
And the same also happens with other 
companies.

241
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,210
Norway's Fund backs activists bid at 
alphabet meeting.

242
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:53,253
As you know,
Alphabet is the conglomerate that owns 

243
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:58,150
Google and Youtube.
A small group of shells is wanted google

244
00:12:58,151 --> 00:12:58,984
to refine the fake news filter and 
having the support of Norway's Fund 

245
00:13:02,381 --> 00:13:06,370
helps them at win very crucial votes.
The same thing happens with apple.

246
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:08,980
In this case,
Norway is the eighth biggest shareholder

247
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:09,993
with more than 9 billion US dollars 
invested and they aren't exactly silent 

248
00:13:13,121 --> 00:13:13,954
in the shareholder meetings in general,
Norway is pushing some of the world's 

249
00:13:16,511 --> 00:13:17,344
biggest companies to change their 
corporate policies on many different 

250
00:13:19,271 --> 00:13:20,290
fronts.
Of course,

251
00:13:20,291 --> 00:13:22,540
there's the gender gap that that's not 
the only one.

252
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,320
Part of the Norwegian ideology focuses 
on this

253
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:26,243
two

254
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:35,080
Norway sovereign fund to focus on high 
executive pay.

255
00:13:35,170 --> 00:13:36,003
In many ways,
big multinational executives make a big 

256
00:13:37,751 --> 00:13:39,880
sign of aries despite the company losing
money.

257
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:42,370
We saw this several times during the 
financial crisis.

258
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:43,233
As you can imagine,
shareholders of these companies are not 

259
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:48,280
exactly happy with this,
but it's hard to speak out when you only

260
00:13:48,281 --> 00:13:50,110
hold a small number of shares in the 
company,

261
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:51,063
and this is where Norway comes in,
is it's a loudspeaker for smaller 

262
00:13:54,281 --> 00:13:55,114
investors,
many countries trying to control the 

263
00:13:56,711 --> 00:13:57,544
world within militaries,
other countries trying to sway foreign 

264
00:13:59,831 --> 00:14:00,664
governments with diplomacy.
Norway expands their power through 

265
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,250
influence on the biggest global 
companies,

266
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,383
and this is the Norwegian conspiracy,
but meanwhile Norwegian citizens can 

267
00:14:10,931 --> 00:14:14,170
sleep at night knowing that even if oil 
prices go down,

268
00:14:14,171 --> 00:14:16,180
they have their futures guaranteed,

269
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,533
and now it's your turn.
Do you think it's a good idea for a 

270
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
whole country to invest in the stock 
market?

271
00:14:26,500 --> 00:14:30,430
Do you think that the Norwegian 
influences good for global capitalism?

272
00:14:30,730 --> 00:14:32,050
What do you think it's bad?
Well,

273
