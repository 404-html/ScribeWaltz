1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,210
Aw,

2
00:00:08,210 --> 00:00:11,380
Germany is the place where BMW Rammstein
and FK.

3
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:13,580
That's nudist culture were born.
Yeah.

4
00:00:17,770 --> 00:00:20,350
Nevertheless,
Gemini has something even more important

5
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,184
than all of these things,
and that is the fact that it is the 

6
00:00:23,681 --> 00:00:25,750
world's ultimate factory.
Yep.

7
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:26,613
You heard that rice,
and I can guess what you're probably 

8
00:00:27,911 --> 00:00:29,170
thinking right now.
Wait a minute,

9
00:00:29,171 --> 00:00:31,930
Simon isn't shiner the country?
You are a TV screens,

10
00:00:31,931 --> 00:00:32,764
mobile phones as well.
Practically every good under the sun is 

11
00:00:35,171 --> 00:00:36,004
made.

12
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:40,913
Wow.

13
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:45,150
The thing is that's not entirely true.
Now of course China does lead the charge

14
00:00:45,151 --> 00:00:47,430
when it comes to exports,
but do you know wasp,

15
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:49,710
in order to manufacture all of those 
products,

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:52,890
they need to import a lot of things from
abroad.

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,310
Germany in standard sells way more than 
what it binds.

18
00:00:56,311 --> 00:00:57,144
In fact,
one out of every 10 product sold on the 

19
00:00:58,591 --> 00:01:01,170
international market is made in this 
country,

20
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,540
which has a population 15 times.
It's smaller than sure

21
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:05,413
why now.

22
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,073
Yes,
we all know those big German car 

23
00:01:10,161 --> 00:01:11,870
companies like BMW,
Audi,

24
00:01:11,871 --> 00:01:15,260
or Volkswagen.
But that is way more than that.

25
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:16,220
If you don't believe me,
well,

26
00:01:16,221 --> 00:01:18,380
just consider your mobile phone.
And I know,

27
00:01:18,381 --> 00:01:21,290
I know on the back is going to say 
something like assembled in the People's

28
00:01:21,291 --> 00:01:24,710
Republic of China,
but I'm not talking about this.

29
00:01:24,830 --> 00:01:25,663
I'm talking about if you open up that 
phone that you're going to find a bunch 

30
00:01:28,641 --> 00:01:29,474
of microchips insight as an example here
of that chip that makes your phone till 

31
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:34,610
you know when you rotate it in the 
screen matches up.

32
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,563
Vance probably most likely made by a 
German company called Bosch Sensor 

33
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,010
attack,
but not only that,

34
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:40,873
many of the robots is instilling these 
Chinese factories assembling these 

35
00:01:43,641 --> 00:01:45,890
phones are probably made in Germany.

36
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:52,500
In other words,
in Germany,

37
00:01:52,501 --> 00:01:53,334
they manufacture the things that go 
inside of other things that are 

38
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,154
manufactured by things that are made in 
Germany and now you might be wondering 

39
00:01:59,370 --> 00:02:01,770
how is any of that possible?
I mean factories,

40
00:02:01,771 --> 00:02:03,990
they should be built in places with 
cheap labor costs,

41
00:02:03,991 --> 00:02:04,830
right?
I mean,

42
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:05,723
how is it possible Germany with 
relatively high salaries is such an 

43
00:02:08,821 --> 00:02:10,400
industrial powerhouse.
Well,

44
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:12,960
the good news is that today we're going 
to answer that question for you,

45
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,060
but as always,
before we get into all of that,

46
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,810
let's take a look back at the history.
Okay?

47
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:18,843
Yeah.

48
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:27,860
Liberalism offset wells was it?
Europe was pretty done,

49
00:02:27,861 --> 00:02:29,330
destroyed.
Countries like Italy,

50
00:02:29,331 --> 00:02:30,590
France,
western Germany,

51
00:02:30,591 --> 00:02:32,480
which was the capitalist side of 
Germany.

52
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:35,600
They got a massive money groans from 
their good friends.

53
00:02:35,601 --> 00:02:40,601
Uncle Sam.
Wait just a minute because each of these

54
00:02:41,051 --> 00:02:43,990
countries use that money in totally 
different ways.

55
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:47,500
The French president for instance,
what's this guy that you'd see on tv?

56
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:49,090
Generally Joe's,
they go.

57
00:02:52,340 --> 00:02:56,390
It all came from the military who was no
friend of private companies is political

58
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:57,224
creed.
The so called dirtied sma was 

59
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,063
nationalizing big businesses and leading
the whole country's economy as if it 

60
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:03,570
wasn't

61
00:03:03,570 --> 00:03:04,403
army.

62
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:12,030
They chose a totally different path.
Both the Chancellor Conrad,

63
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:14,560
either an hour and his finance minister 
Ludvig Ah,

64
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:17,790
heart spent years thinking about that 
new and economic system.

65
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,170
It was a mixture between the composition
of free market capitalism and the safety

66
00:03:22,171 --> 00:03:23,004
nets provided by the government.
They then decided to give this system 

67
00:03:25,711 --> 00:03:26,544
what is probably the worst name in the 
world ever be called it auto liberalism 

68
00:03:29,671 --> 00:03:30,720
or social marketing.

69
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:31,753
Honami

70
00:03:33,490 --> 00:03:34,323
addition is the most promising means to 
achieve and secure prosperity nude vic 

71
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:41,100
Elford and other words,
while the goal centralize the economy in

72
00:03:41,101 --> 00:03:41,970
Paris.
Conrad,

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
I don't know.
I designed a system where the government

74
00:03:44,401 --> 00:03:45,234
would put into place a set of conditions
that the other players would make that 

75
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,970
own decisions.
This explains why in Germany,

76
00:03:50,971 --> 00:03:52,770
trade unions,
regional governments,

77
00:03:52,771 --> 00:03:55,100
and of course companies are quite too 
important.

78
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,243
Didn't say.
Now you might be wondering what are the 

79
00:04:01,731 --> 00:04:05,150
keys that are needed for a system like 
this to work and well,

80
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:06,430
has it really worked out?
It's all,

81
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:07,333
well,
let's get right into that stable 

82
00:04:11,181 --> 00:04:13,490
currency.
I'm pretty sure at some point you've had

83
00:04:13,491 --> 00:04:17,180
some economists saying that devaluing 
your currency boosts Zach Sports,

84
00:04:17,181 --> 00:04:18,170
right?
For instance,

85
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:21,920
imagine we have a shoe manufacturing 
facility in Mexico and we want to sell a

86
00:04:21,921 --> 00:04:25,640
pair of shoes to the American market.
Let's say the price of the shoes is 2000

87
00:04:25,641 --> 00:04:28,220
and Mexican pesos at the time and making
this video,

88
00:04:28,221 --> 00:04:31,940
those 2000 pesos is equal to about 110 
US dollars.

89
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:34,733
Let's say that all of a sudden,
Mexican central bank decides to print 

90
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,800
money and therefore devalue its currency
from one day to the next.

91
00:04:40,801 --> 00:04:43,290
The pair of shoes could be worth 90 US 
dollars.

92
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,153
Therefore,
it'd be easier to sell these shoes 

93
00:04:45,391 --> 00:04:46,410
abroad.
Now,

94
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,273
this is a theory,
it's actually supported by most 

95
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:50,520
governments today.
Now the Germans,

96
00:04:50,521 --> 00:04:51,354
they actually decided to do the exact 
opposites and for the later part of the 

97
00:04:53,941 --> 00:04:54,774
20th century,
the German mark was actually one of the 

98
00:04:56,611 --> 00:04:59,060
most stable currencies in the entire 
world.

99
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,913
Wow.

100
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,880
This might lead you to one's out.
Wow.

101
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,800
How is it possible that Germany could 
export so much when their products,

102
00:05:07,801 --> 00:05:09,730
what not actually that sheep.
All right.

103
00:05:09,731 --> 00:05:10,564
Well,
let's go back to our shoes example for 

104
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:12,950
just a moment,
but actually this is,

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,980
I'm going to tell you the story of a 
real company.

106
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:17,830
This is a company from the north of 
Germany and it's called Desmos.

107
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,390
It's not a particularly big business.
It has around 200 staff now,

108
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,224
this company,
it started right after the war being 

109
00:05:27,521 --> 00:05:31,990
founded in 1946 and they specialized in 
making machines for shoe manufacturing.

110
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:33,003
Now in order to do this,
they needed to import lots of machines 

111
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:38,410
from the United States and thanks to 
having a stable currency,

112
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:41,770
the price for importing those machines,
it was relatively low.

113
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:44,500
They then decided to rent the facility 
because at the end of the day,

114
00:05:44,501 --> 00:05:45,334
since there was no inflation,
rents would not go up and they could 

115
00:05:47,801 --> 00:05:50,870
calculate the future cost.
All of this space reliable,

116
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:55,890
but

117
00:05:55,890 --> 00:05:58,670
it wasn't any of that.
Since German companies could offer lower

118
00:05:58,671 --> 00:06:02,030
prices,
desmond had to innovate and in 1960 they

119
00:06:02,031 --> 00:06:02,864
invested in state of the art 
technologies to manufacture rubber sole 

120
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,560
shoes.
10 years later,

121
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,380
decimate was the world leader in pvc 
souls.

122
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:13,303
It's in fact like lever at the soles of 
the shoes you're wearing right now are 

123
00:06:15,621 --> 00:06:19,970
made by a decimal machine.
This company with 200 staff now sells to

124
00:06:20,030 --> 00:06:22,120
every country in the world,
including,

125
00:06:22,121 --> 00:06:22,200
yeah,

126
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,033
China.

127
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,593
I need know.
This is just one example of the 

128
00:06:28,980 --> 00:06:31,740
thousands of small and medium sized 
companies.

129
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,950
The so called middle stand vertically 
made up Germany,

130
00:06:35,220 --> 00:06:36,053
the middle stand success as attracted,
admiring glances from the rest of 

131
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:40,014
Europe.
But it's built on foundations that may 

132
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,860
be hard to copy.
And yes,

133
00:06:43,890 --> 00:06:44,723
I know,
I know Jim and mark is a thing of the 

134
00:06:45,811 --> 00:06:46,644
past because in 2008 the Germans,
they abandon this currency and they 

135
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:52,440
adopted the euro.
But think about it,

136
00:06:52,441 --> 00:06:53,274
while other countries like Spain,
they were using weaker countries before 

137
00:06:56,010 --> 00:06:59,160
Germany had had a strong currency for 
decades.

138
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,333
That means that in 2002 German companies
were already more competitive than 

139
00:07:05,671 --> 00:07:07,380
anyone else's.
But again,

140
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,243
hold on a minute because there's many 
other things that can explain the 

141
00:07:10,291 --> 00:07:13,470
success of the German model.
So let's dig into these now

142
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:17,133
the educational system.
Now I can probably guess what you're 

143
00:07:19,211 --> 00:07:20,080
gonna say.
Come on.

144
00:07:20,081 --> 00:07:22,750
Zion in Germany isn't really famous for 
its educational system,

145
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:24,160
is it?
And to some extent,

146
00:07:24,161 --> 00:07:25,810
that's right.
If you look at the piece of revolt,

147
00:07:25,811 --> 00:07:28,660
Germany isn't even ranking inside the 
top 10 but then again,

148
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:32,530
German students managed to find a job 
right after they finish their studies.

149
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:35,200
So we've not such a great educational 
system world.

150
00:07:35,201 --> 00:07:38,740
Why is this happening?
Well,

151
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:42,100
the answer of that actually the in that 
boot Haitian or training system.

152
00:07:42,130 --> 00:07:42,963
Now let's imagine you're a high school 
students in Germany and you don't want 

153
00:07:45,071 --> 00:07:48,410
to go to university.
So instead you decide to study to become

154
00:07:48,411 --> 00:07:49,660
made plummet.
Well,

155
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:50,523
from the first moment you're already 
going to be working for a company which 

156
00:07:53,051 --> 00:07:53,884
has an arrangement with the school.
This means from Monday to Wednesday you 

157
00:07:56,651 --> 00:08:00,070
go to a classroom and from Thursday to 
Friday you go to the company's workshops

158
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,760
[inaudible]

159
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:07,300
that you would be trained by the 
experienced plumbers and you would get a

160
00:08:07,301 --> 00:08:08,134
salary of between 300 to $500 a month.
And this salary is actually pretty 

161
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:12,724
important because it means that the 
company that a pain you really want to 

162
00:08:15,881 --> 00:08:17,080
make you work.
I mean,

163
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,420
otherwise the firms pretty much just 
throwing money away.

164
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:20,283
Wait.

165
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,833
The outcome of this is that Jen and 
students know how it is to be in a real 

166
00:08:27,961 --> 00:08:29,940
life working environments.
In fact,

167
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:33,420
many of them actually remain in the 
company where they did their training is

168
00:08:33,421 --> 00:08:35,610
of course these gen and funds.
In exchange,

169
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,730
they get well trained workers and 
another on the subject of workers.

170
00:08:38,731 --> 00:08:42,030
Let us move on to another key piece of 
the German system.

171
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:45,460
German

172
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,520
trade unions in other countries like 
France or Spain,

173
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,740
most of the labor laws are made by 
parliaments,

174
00:08:50,741 --> 00:08:51,574
but that's not the case in Germany until
2015 gentleman's didn't even have a 

175
00:08:54,551 --> 00:08:57,540
minimum.
Salaries were negotiated by trade unions

176
00:08:57,541 --> 00:09:00,570
and employers in Germany.
Syndicates are extremely important.

177
00:09:00,630 --> 00:09:01,463
Actually.
Those big companies like Audi or BMW 

178
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,223
with more than 2000 workers are required
to have union representatives on their 

179
00:09:07,711 --> 00:09:08,544
administrative.

180
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:12,023
Instead of this,
Siemens has 10 shareholder 

181
00:09:13,401 --> 00:09:14,234
representatives on their board and 
therefore they must have 10 people 

182
00:09:16,731 --> 00:09:18,470
representing the workers.
Remember that?

183
00:09:18,471 --> 00:09:19,304
This one,
because it makes a big difference in 

184
00:09:20,631 --> 00:09:22,340
Spain,
there's an example of another country.

185
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,233
I think company like Telefonica has no 
trade union representatives on their 

186
00:09:26,541 --> 00:09:27,374
board of administration.
The unions going to be participate in 

187
00:09:29,661 --> 00:09:30,494
another body,
which is called the company council and 

188
00:09:32,930 --> 00:09:36,650
they can only speak about matters that 
affect salaries or working conditions.

189
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:37,633
Now by contrast in Germany,
trade unions have a voice on every 

190
00:09:40,311 --> 00:09:43,650
decision that the company makes.
When Siemens wants to start operating in

191
00:09:43,651 --> 00:09:44,484
a new market or launch a new product,
they have to ask the shareholders of 

192
00:09:47,271 --> 00:09:49,550
course,
but they also have to ask for that trade

193
00:09:49,551 --> 00:09:54,551
union representatives.
Now you might be wondering,

194
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,210
isn't this just bad news for the 
company?

195
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,044
I mean,
we pretty much take it for granted that 

196
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,800
unions and companies not exactly best 
friends.

197
00:10:02,950 --> 00:10:04,810
Well,
it doesn't actually have to be that way.

198
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,000
Think about it for a moment.
Thanks to this setup,

199
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:07,863
Siemens and bmws workers,
they know whether a company is doing 

200
00:10:11,171 --> 00:10:12,004
well or whether they're losing money,
and of course when things are going bad 

201
00:10:14,711 --> 00:10:15,544
for the company,
they can make compromises like reducing 

202
00:10:17,501 --> 00:10:19,860
their working hours instead of being 
fired,

203
00:10:22,670 --> 00:10:23,503
cut working hours at German facilities.
This explains why during the financial 

204
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:31,310
crisis of 2008 German companies didn't 
fire a large number of people.

205
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:33,320
Well,
this is good for the workers.

206
00:10:33,670 --> 00:10:34,550
It's good for the company.

207
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:39,820
Wait a minute because I know what you're
thinking right now.

208
00:10:39,821 --> 00:10:40,654
Please.
Jen and trade unions are collaborating 

209
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:45,280
with big capitalists in order to exploit
the workers rice,

210
00:10:45,281 --> 00:10:46,510
rice,
I mean it must be happening.

211
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:48,250
Well,
the answer is actually,

212
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,113
certainly not.
The reality is that the average wage in 

213
00:10:51,701 --> 00:10:54,700
Germany is around 3,400 US dollars a 
month.

214
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:55,623
That's higher than the state of New York
and that's in a country with a pretty 

215
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:01,060
affordable cost of living.
A flat in Berlin is about half the price

216
00:11:01,061 --> 00:11:03,850
of a flat in New York City and despite 
all of this,

217
00:11:03,851 --> 00:11:04,684
Germany maintains its position as the 
third biggest country when it comes to 

218
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:08,374
export.

219
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:11,973
So then the question becomes,
do you think your country could benefit 

220
00:11:13,511 --> 00:11:14,344
from the German model or perhaps do you 
think these policies are impossible to 

221
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:17,864
implement elsewhere?
Please leave us your answers in the
