1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,350
That's conducted experiments.
Just go and Google these two words.

2
00:00:04,351 --> 00:00:06,060
Donald Trump,

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,790
what did you get when you googled them?
Well,

4
00:00:12,791 --> 00:00:16,030
I'm sure you found lots of results about
his latest tweets,

5
00:00:16,031 --> 00:00:20,560
his latest bold statements,
or maybe his latest sexual scandal,

6
00:00:20,610 --> 00:00:21,443
but you probably have to click to the 
seconds or even the third page to find 

7
00:00:24,731 --> 00:00:29,320
out anything about what is actually one 
of his biggest political bats.

8
00:00:29,350 --> 00:00:33,040
We're talking about something that might
change the international economy.

9
00:00:33,041 --> 00:00:36,520
It might change the price of oil and the
fate of two countries.

10
00:00:36,820 --> 00:00:38,140
Yes,
dear viewer,

11
00:00:38,141 --> 00:00:40,360
I'm talking of course,
or maybe not.

12
00:00:40,361 --> 00:00:42,430
Of course it was on that third page of 
Google.

13
00:00:42,730 --> 00:00:47,730
I'm talking about the Iran sanctions.
This is such a complex matter,

14
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,900
but we will make not one,
not two,

15
00:00:52,901 --> 00:00:56,740
but three videos covering all of the 
various caveats.

16
00:00:56,741 --> 00:00:59,650
In today's video,
we're going to focus on one question.

17
00:00:59,651 --> 00:01:03,610
What does the nuclear program have to do
with the price of oil,

18
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:04,643
and at the end of this video,
you're going to see where I'm coming 

19
00:01:06,011 --> 00:01:11,011
from.
As with every good story,

20
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:17,370
we should start by introducing our 
characters.

21
00:01:17,371 --> 00:01:20,880
The first one is of course,
the Islamic Republic of Iran,

22
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:24,210
a country known for Persian carpets,
uranium enrichments,

23
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:25,860
and of course oil.

24
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:31,110
Yup.

25
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,790
Iran has the fourth largest amount of 
dinosaur juice reserves on the planet,

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,683
but that is not all.
If you've been subscribed to visual 

27
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,474
politic for a long time,
you already know that there are 

28
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,810
different types of crude oil.
For example,

29
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:46,110
if you want to extract an oil barrel in 
Scotland from the North Sea,

30
00:01:46,290 --> 00:01:47,123
you've got to build a sea platform.
You've got to make a super deep hole 

31
00:01:49,621 --> 00:01:50,454
that goes below the bottom of the ocean 
and then use a rocket technology to 

32
00:01:54,361 --> 00:01:55,950
refine it.
In total,

33
00:01:55,951 --> 00:02:00,690
a barrel has an extraction cost of more 
than $44 in Iran.

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:03,480
The extraction cost is less than a 
fourth of that.

35
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:04,603
Along with Saudi Arabia,
they have the cheapest oil on the 

36
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:08,364
planet,

37
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:15,710
so well,
what's the problem?

38
00:02:15,711 --> 00:02:17,780
Jeep all sounds great.
Well,

39
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:18,643
they can't sell it to to most countries.
Iran's economy is virtually isolated 

40
00:02:22,701 --> 00:02:23,534
from the rest of the world.
This means they can only export about 3 

41
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:30,170
million barrels per day of oil.
Although due to the threat of sanctions,

42
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,690
there are currently only exporting about
1 million barrels.

43
00:02:32,691 --> 00:02:32,780
Yeah,

44
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:33,613
per day.

45
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,470
That might seem like a lot,
but it's nothing.

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,333
If we compare it with the 7.5
million barrels per day currently being 

47
00:02:42,241 --> 00:02:43,074
exploited by Saudi Arabia,
which is currently producing nearly 11 

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,690
million barrels per day in total,

49
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:49,780
it's an the,
you might be wondering.

50
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:50,531
Well,
Simon,

51
00:02:50,531 --> 00:02:53,790
who is Iran's worst enemy is America.
Ryan Stone.

52
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:58,580
Sure.
Well,

53
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,473
you're wrong.
Aaron's arch enemy is actually Saudi 

54
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,630
Arabia and yeah,
I know both countries or Muslim,

55
00:03:04,631 --> 00:03:05,464
both countries follow strict religious 
principles and both countries consider 

56
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,050
human rights.
Well optional,

57
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,930
but not all of Islam is the same.
And Iran,

58
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,793
Shia Muslims are the majority.
While Saudi Arabia is a Sunni Muslim 

59
00:03:18,821 --> 00:03:22,450
country.
So do you surmise they hate each other,

60
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,970
but that's another story for another 
video.

61
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:27,670
So what is Saudi Arabia's problem?
Well,

62
00:03:27,671 --> 00:03:29,620
despite having oil and lots of money,
there are,

63
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:34,621
comedy is the edge of collapse.
Basically they spend all of them.

64
00:03:37,451 --> 00:03:40,430
I need living like a hip hop artists.
On a Friday night.

65
00:03:40,610 --> 00:03:43,250
And since they don't export anything 
other than than oil,

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,090
anytime the price of the barrel of oil 
goes down on the market,

67
00:03:47,330 --> 00:03:50,630
their economy goes into panic mode.
So now you might be wondering,

68
00:03:50,631 --> 00:03:53,150
well,
who's Saudi Arabia's best friends?

69
00:03:53,151 --> 00:03:56,210
Well,
this is actually when America comes into

70
00:03:56,211 --> 00:03:57,044
the picture.

71
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,903
Okay.

72
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,491
All right.
All right.

73
00:04:00,491 --> 00:04:01,324
So the relationship between Uncle Sam 
and the Saudi royal house is not as 

74
00:04:04,091 --> 00:04:08,200
wonderful as it seems from the outside.
During the Obama administration,

75
00:04:08,201 --> 00:04:09,034
the White House puts some pressure on 
the Saudis and tried to get closer ties 

76
00:04:11,411 --> 00:04:12,244
with Iran.
This is how that nuclear deal came 

77
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:19,261
about.
Now the president is Donald Trump,

78
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,570
and from the moment he stepped into the 
Oval Office,

79
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:25,404
trump has made it clear who is ally in 
the Middle East was this is why his 

80
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:32,430
first official trip was to the Saudi 
capital of Riyadh.

81
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:38,113
Even now,
after the alleged murder of a Saudi 

82
00:04:39,891 --> 00:04:43,340
journalist in Turkey,
Donald Trump is trying to avoid making a

83
00:04:43,341 --> 00:04:44,174
from condemnation,
but the best proof of his friendship 

84
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:50,240
with the Saudi royal house are the Iran 
nuclear sanctions.

85
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,380
Yep.
You heard that,

86
00:04:51,381 --> 00:04:52,820
right?
So now you might be wondering,

87
00:04:52,821 --> 00:04:53,654
well,
what does Saudi Arabia have to do with 

88
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:56,654
Iran sanctions?
What does oil have to do with any of 

89
00:04:59,121 --> 00:04:59,811
this?
Well,

90
00:04:59,811 --> 00:05:01,790
today we're going to answer these 
questions,

91
00:05:01,791 --> 00:05:03,890
but before we do,
as always,

92
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:05,270
let's take a look back at the head

93
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,233
straight

94
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,720
political ball.
Remember this date,

95
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,860
April,
2015 this was the date when Barack Obama

96
00:05:14,861 --> 00:05:18,070
signs the Iran nuclear deal.
Basically in this agreement,

97
00:05:18,071 --> 00:05:18,910
America,
China,

98
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:19,744
Russia,
and the European Union said that they 

99
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:24,730
would start trading with Iran if they 
stopped then nuclear program.

100
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:25,833
This explains why from one day to the 
next oil exports from Iran almost 

101
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:31,250
doubled.
Just have a look at this

102
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:32,153
chops

103
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:38,440
to Obama's deal.
Iran.

104
00:05:38,441 --> 00:05:41,670
Ron was making 1.8
million barrels a day after the deal.

105
00:05:41,671 --> 00:05:45,240
Iran increased it to as much as 3 
million barrels.

106
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:46,950
Then Yukon's bill,
how was Spain,

107
00:05:46,951 --> 00:05:48,990
France,
and other European countries,

108
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:52,650
and what happens when the oil supply on 
the international market increases?

109
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,513
Well,
the price of a barrel of oil drops and 

110
00:05:55,570 --> 00:05:56,910
you just have a look at this other 
chart.

111
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:04,640
At the moment,
the deal was signed.

112
00:06:04,670 --> 00:06:08,780
The brand's barrel with 67 US dollars 
just a year later.

113
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:10,700
It was twice as cheap.
Of course,

114
00:06:10,701 --> 00:06:13,370
there are many other factors that could 
explain this price drop,

115
00:06:13,371 --> 00:06:15,710
but Iran,
it was definitely one of them,

116
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:16,873
but the,
hold on just a minute because this 

117
00:06:17,721 --> 00:06:20,000
really is just the beginning of our 
story.

118
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:22,250
Now,
longtime visual politics subscribers,

119
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,113
which you should be subscribed below,
you already know how hard it is to 

120
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,280
extract oil.
You need technology,

121
00:06:28,281 --> 00:06:31,880
you need companies,
you need money and lots of it.

122
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:32,803
In other words,
if the National Iranian oil company 

123
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:38,810
wanted to produce more oil barrels,
they needed investors,

124
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,330
and this was when the real financial bom
APP,

125
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:44,173
so lately draw,
you're Rabia is considering an IPO of 

126
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:51,534
Saudi Aramco,
potentially the world's most valuable 

127
00:06:54,121 --> 00:06:58,200
company.
Let's pause right there.

128
00:06:58,290 --> 00:07:01,500
Why is this news so important for our 
story?

129
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,810
Well,
let's rewind a little further.

130
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,340
Okay.

131
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:30,640
Financial explosion.
Now I'm going to ask you a question.

132
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:33,040
What is the world's biggest company?
Now,

133
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:36,430
many of you might reply with apple or 
Coca Cola or,

134
00:07:36,431 --> 00:07:39,850
or maybe some big bank somewhere that 
you might've heard of.

135
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,511
Well,
actually,

136
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,344
it's none of those things.
The world's biggest company is actually 

137
00:07:43,241 --> 00:07:44,074
Aramco.

138
00:07:48,690 --> 00:07:49,140
Okay?

139
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,260
This is Saudi Arabia's national oil 
company.

140
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,213
However,
they waste your time finding it on the 

141
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:57,120
stock market.
It's not only is it not public,

142
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,940
Aramco is owned by the Saudi royal 
family.

143
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,880
Nonetheless,
having the world's biggest company,

144
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:12,410
it doesn't mean you can't go bankrupt.
You'll see as oil prices go down,

145
00:08:12,411 --> 00:08:17,240
Saudi Arabia is in dire straits.
They need to diversify their economy.

146
00:08:17,241 --> 00:08:20,810
They've got to gain wealth from other 
things other than just petroleum.

147
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,360
So how can they do this?
Well,

148
00:08:23,450 --> 00:08:25,750
essentially the big idea was to start a 
hedge.

149
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:33,250
Sorry.
Audio Rabia

150
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:37,060
wants to grow its sovereign wealth fund 
to over $2 trillion.

151
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,820
Now,
weird as this might seem,

152
00:08:38,830 --> 00:08:42,610
this wouldn't be the first time a whole 
country invested in businesses.

153
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,460
In fact,
the world's biggest hedge funds actually

154
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:48,310
belongs to the Norwegian government.
This audis,

155
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:49,750
they just want to make something 
similar.

156
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:52,810
So this all sounds pretty good.
So what's the problem,

157
00:08:52,811 --> 00:08:53,740
Simon?
Well,

158
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,730
they need money then.
It's 20 of the world's biggest company.

159
00:08:56,731 --> 00:08:58,050
Where did you get money from?
Well,

160
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,913
you just sell something,
your company on the stock markets and 

161
00:09:00,451 --> 00:09:03,000
that gives you all of the cash you need.
It's basic business.

162
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,893
This way.
The Saudi royal family would kill two 

163
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:09,420
birds with one stone.
First they make money and they also keep

164
00:09:09,421 --> 00:09:12,780
Iran from getting that juicy investors' 
money.

165
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:13,703
You remember how he told you when in 
2016 around once invest investors to 

166
00:09:15,991 --> 00:09:19,440
build new oil rig swelled before those 
investors would consider Iran,

167
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:24,390
Saudi Arabia at wanted to dangle a suite
at piece of candy in front of their eyes

168
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:27,030
and that was of course Aramco,
but hold on a minute,

169
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:28,013
it wasn't that

170
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,313
he see listing a company on the stock 
market is great cause all of a sudden 

171
00:09:36,691 --> 00:09:37,524
you get a lot of cats.
The problem and your turn for being a 

172
00:09:42,621 --> 00:09:43,454
publicly listed company,
you must make your books publicly 

173
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:49,310
available after all,
no one would invest in a company if they

174
00:09:49,311 --> 00:09:50,144
can't see that company's financial 
statements to see how they're making 

175
00:09:52,971 --> 00:09:55,250
money and how they're spending it.
In other words,

176
00:09:55,370 --> 00:09:56,203
you've got to be transparent and you 
have to remember that transparency is 

177
00:09:59,241 --> 00:10:02,540
the least favorite word of the Saudi 
royal house.

178
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:03,463
You'll see for decades,
the Saudi Monique's have basically been 

179
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:07,900
using Aramco for anything they wanted,
policies,

180
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,853
luxury,
and those sorts of things that you 

181
00:10:10,551 --> 00:10:14,470
probably don't even want to know about,
but this is not the problem.

182
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:15,423
According to Prince Mohammed bin Salman,
also known as mbs Aramco is worth $2 

183
00:10:21,280 --> 00:10:23,830
trillion.
That means that this 5% he wants to sell

184
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:26,890
would be worth $100 billion.
Nonetheless,

185
00:10:26,891 --> 00:10:28,960
as soon as he started talking about the 
IPA,

186
00:10:28,961 --> 00:10:33,190
all these various financial analyst 
started making their own estimations and

187
00:10:33,191 --> 00:10:37,420
they essentially said $2 trillion bad 
with the price of oil falling like this.

188
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:40,210
Are you smoking crack?
Best case scenario,

189
00:10:40,211 --> 00:10:41,044
best case,
you're looking at one point 2 trillion 

190
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:45,670
or one point 5 trillion.
F we're being rarely,

191
00:10:45,671 --> 00:10:46,870
rarely generous.
Hello?

192
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
Where's that financial explosion that 
the Aramco Ipo was supposed to be?

193
00:10:50,561 --> 00:10:53,830
Basically the game,
nothing but a buzzword and he's,

194
00:10:53,831 --> 00:10:56,380
I'm in the past year.
Anyone asked Prince Salomon,

195
00:10:56,381 --> 00:10:59,890
what he thought about this.
It basically kind of respond like this.

196
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,180
Uh,
yeah.

197
00:11:01,181 --> 00:11:01,871
Yeah.
You know,

198
00:11:01,871 --> 00:11:03,490
man,
it's legit.

199
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:07,150
Another day.
I'm busy with print stuff at later,

200
00:11:07,151 --> 00:11:07,870
man.
Later.

201
00:11:07,870 --> 00:11:11,620
Hold on a moment because this is still 
not the end of our story.

202
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:12,803
Okay.

203
00:11:15,570 --> 00:11:16,403
A crater in the markets.
Here's another day for you to remember 

204
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:23,771
that may at 2018 this is the moment when
trump broke the Iran deal and announce a

205
00:11:23,991 --> 00:11:25,000
new economic sanctions.

206
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:29,060
Yep.

207
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,893
Not only that,
he also promised secondary sanctions 

208
00:11:31,731 --> 00:11:33,890
against those countries that would not 
comply.

209
00:11:34,100 --> 00:11:34,933
In other words,
if any country wants to buy oil from 

210
00:11:36,441 --> 00:11:37,011
Iran,
well,

211
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:37,844
they'd also have to deal with Uncle Sam 
and June off Agastya that that also 

212
00:11:41,091 --> 00:11:44,870
includes the end higher European Union.
Other countries don't really catch.

213
00:11:44,871 --> 00:11:46,070
I know for example,
has said,

214
00:11:46,071 --> 00:11:47,420
you know,
I don't care trump,

215
00:11:47,421 --> 00:11:49,250
whatever,
we're going to buy it all from Iran.

216
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,293
India,
the second largest client has said that 

217
00:11:51,831 --> 00:11:54,200
they will try to reduce imports,
but they can't.

218
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,090
100% stopped buying all from the country
of the ayatollah.

219
00:12:02,900 --> 00:12:05,630
Nonetheless,
it seems like the EU will have to follow

220
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,600
Donald Trump to the latter even if they 
don't want to,

221
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,530
but this as a matter we're actually 
going to discuss in the next video.

222
00:12:12,590 --> 00:12:13,423
The truth is nowadays Europe is buying 
more than 1 million barrels from Iran 

223
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:19,280
every day.
This means if we take it ron,

224
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:20,114
out of the equation,
we have a whole 1 million barrel order 

225
00:12:23,930 --> 00:12:24,763
of it.
Somebody has to fill because you know 

226
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:29,750
one thing is absolutely clear throughout
all of this,

227
00:12:30,050 --> 00:12:30,883
everybody needs that sweet,
sweet dinosaur juice and I bet you can 

228
00:12:34,791 --> 00:12:38,780
guess now who is very,
very happy to be filling that role.

229
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:39,663
Boy,

230
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:46,820
trump pressures Saudi Arabia to increase
oil production.

231
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:47,893
Nevertheless,
Saudi Arabia just increased its 

232
00:12:49,221 --> 00:12:51,740
production by 600,000
barrels.

233
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:55,190
Russia has done say by 200,000
and if you do the math,

234
00:12:55,220 --> 00:12:57,140
it's not tricky.
You get 800,000

235
00:12:57,141 --> 00:12:57,974
barrels.
We still need more to fill that huge 

236
00:13:00,771 --> 00:13:01,604
void and you probably also remember what
happens when we reduce the oil offering 

237
00:13:05,091 --> 00:13:07,550
on the international market.
Oh Yeah,

238
00:13:07,551 --> 00:13:12,320
supply and demand kicks in and the price
of that oil barrel goes up.

239
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:17,500
Let's get back to our Brent shot.
If you pay attention,

240
00:13:19,461 --> 00:13:20,294
you will see that right after trump 
started talking about the Iran 

241
00:13:22,611 --> 00:13:24,440
sanctions,
the dyno juice,

242
00:13:24,441 --> 00:13:28,430
it went up to $80 in other words,
things are starting to go really,

243
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,260
really well for the Saudi economy.

244
00:13:32,210 --> 00:13:33,043
Okay.

245
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:37,630
Saudi Arabia sovereign wealth fund 
raises $11 billion loan.

246
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:39,970
So what does this mean?
Well,

247
00:13:39,971 --> 00:13:41,290
two things.
On the one hand,

248
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:45,010
the Saudi royal family now has a lot 
more breathing space for that.

249
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:45,844
Aramco IPO,
the company is now profitable enough 

250
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:50,320
that they can wait before going to the 
stock market.

251
00:13:50,321 --> 00:13:52,690
So I'll lazy prints,
he doesn't need to worry about it.

252
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,553
On the other hand,
if they could keep the oil barrel at 80 

253
00:13:55,181 --> 00:13:56,014
US dollars,
it would be way easier to hit that 

254
00:13:58,181 --> 00:14:03,181
initial valuation of $2 trillion.
And while that explains news like this,

255
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:07,503
Saudi Crown Prince has ipo for oil giant
Saudi Aramco will happen by early 2021 

256
00:14:12,790 --> 00:14:15,070
meanwhile,
there are two things we should cover.

257
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:15,963
First,
the Islamic Republic of Iran is at the 

258
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:20,260
edge of economic collapse.
This is leading to protests,

259
00:14:20,290 --> 00:14:22,930
social unrest,
and an authoritarian regime.

260
00:14:22,931 --> 00:14:23,764
That is having a very bad situation.
Seconds we have the big question is the 

261
00:14:27,461 --> 00:14:30,610
EU gonna comply with trump sanctions?
The debate,

262
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:32,410
it really couldn't be hotter these days.

263
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:38,680
You asked to protect firms from donald 
trump's sanctions against Iran.

264
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,873
So now the question is,
do you think we are at the beginning of 

265
00:14:42,221 --> 00:14:43,054
the end of the ayatollah's regime?
Do you think the European Union will 

266
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:48,330
keep from buying oil from Iran?
Well,

267
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,263
we'd love to read your thoughts and 
theories and in the following videos 

268
00:14:51,321 --> 00:14:54,080
we're going to see quite how much they 
match with our own.

269
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:56,390
