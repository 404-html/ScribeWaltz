1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:11,050
on the 1st of July of this year,
very special anniversary.

3
00:00:11,051 --> 00:00:11,884
We celebrated 20 years has passed since 
Hong Kong stopped being part of the 

4
00:00:14,771 --> 00:00:18,550
United Kingdom and returns to the 
People's Republic of China.

5
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,860
But they did this under the model one 
country,

6
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:22,390
two systems.
As you know,

7
00:00:22,391 --> 00:00:23,224
although China is a dictatorship,
Hong Kong was incorporated into the 

8
00:00:25,871 --> 00:00:30,760
country as a special administrative 
region where the basic law applies.

9
00:00:30,790 --> 00:00:31,623
This is a law that grants the citizens 
of Hong Kong or a list of rights and 

10
00:00:34,361 --> 00:00:35,194
liberties,
which would be unthinkable in the rest 

11
00:00:36,911 --> 00:00:39,700
of China,
perhaps with the exception of Macau.

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:41,890
Besides this,
Hong Kong has its own currency,

13
00:00:41,891 --> 00:00:44,620
its own immigration policy as well as 
its own police,

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,410
customs and courts.
So in its everyday life,

15
00:00:47,411 --> 00:00:50,500
the country works almost as if it were 
an independent country.

16
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:52,173
Just a minute here because I did say 
almost Beijing's interference has been 

17
00:00:56,231 --> 00:00:57,064
getting more and more intense times.
Don't think that Beijing is being 

18
00:00:59,981 --> 00:01:01,990
discreet about it.
Not at all.

19
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:03,580
In fact,
we already told you about it.

20
00:01:03,581 --> 00:01:04,460
Heroin,
visual policy,

21
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:08,080
how pro-democracy advocates have been 
tortured and killed.

22
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:09,670
As an interesting aside.
By the way,

23
00:01:09,671 --> 00:01:10,504
China has recently kidnapped five 
librarians in Hong Kong for spreading 

24
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:15,400
ideas against China's control of the 
city.

25
00:01:15,401 --> 00:01:18,130
So in order to celebrate this 20th 
anniversary,

26
00:01:18,190 --> 00:01:21,010
Xi Jinping made his first visit to Hong 
Kong.

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,530
He is the president of China thereafter 
rule

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,330
[inaudible]

29
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,080
see Jinping in Hong Kong.

30
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:29,600
Wow.

31
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,560
Changing things,
visit.

32
00:01:30,561 --> 00:01:31,394
Was it loaded with symbolism since it 
has happened at a time when China has 

33
00:01:34,371 --> 00:01:37,730
been receiving lots and lots of 
criticism about Hong Kong,

34
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,623
this visit to view at lost it for three 
days and in this short period of time 

35
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:45,650
the Chinese president has decided to 
make things pretty clear

36
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:48,553
to,
to endanger national sovereignty and 

37
00:01:50,001 --> 00:01:50,834
security challenge.
The power of the central government or 

38
00:01:52,941 --> 00:01:53,774
use Hong Kong to carry out infiltration 
and sabotage activities against the 

39
00:01:57,261 --> 00:01:58,094
mainland is an act that crosses the red 
line and he's absolutely impermissible 

40
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,133
cgm pain,

41
00:02:03,210 --> 00:02:04,043
in other words for Beijing.
All that stuff about freedom of speech 

42
00:02:06,361 --> 00:02:07,194
and democracy in Hong Kong has a lot of 
limits and as they are certainly not 

43
00:02:11,581 --> 00:02:12,414
going to allow any activist or a 
politician to let things get out of 

44
00:02:15,241 --> 00:02:17,920
hands and challenge Beijing's control in
any

45
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:18,913
wait.

46
00:02:21,390 --> 00:02:23,430
Well,
Xi Jinping doesn't just want to let them

47
00:02:23,431 --> 00:02:25,370
go with a warning.
Absolutely.

48
00:02:30,210 --> 00:02:34,120
Of trying to also use this visit to 
presided over the largest military march

49
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:36,580
in the history of Hong Kong with Chinese
troops.

50
00:02:36,581 --> 00:02:37,414
Of course,
he also used this visit to attends the 

51
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:41,680
inaugural speech of Carrie Lam,
the chief executive of Hong Kong.

52
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:47,360
Aging Pink

53
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,193
is the Superior Authority and even the 
Basic Law clearly forbids him from 

54
00:02:51,141 --> 00:02:51,974
meddling in local politics.
He did take the opportunity to ask the 

55
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:57,160
new chief executive two things.
First,

56
00:02:57,161 --> 00:02:57,994
he asked about the passing of an anti 
subversion law in order to convict all 

57
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:03,450
dissidence he data defend things,
assumptions,

58
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:06,460
democracy or independence for Hong Kong 
and seconds.

59
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:10,720
The approval of a plan of patriotic 
education for the youth.

60
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:11,680
Yep.
You heard that right?

61
00:03:11,770 --> 00:03:13,660
And this is what happens in 
dictatorships.

62
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,050
They like their kids to be educated 
about their obedience.

63
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:22,051
To the regime.
So as you can probably imagine,

64
00:03:22,561 --> 00:03:23,394
Hong Kong citizens,
we're not particularly willing to do 

65
00:03:25,261 --> 00:03:26,094
this.
And on July the first 60,000 people 

66
00:03:28,051 --> 00:03:31,550
demonstrated demanding more freedom and 
more democracy

67
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,513
urge the people of Hong Kong do not give
up once we give up than we will for 

68
00:03:37,201 --> 00:03:40,720
certain slowly deteriorate into what is 
becoming of China today.

69
00:03:41,210 --> 00:03:44,350
Avery,
I'm the chairman of the League of Social

70
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:44,450
Democrats.

71
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,360
This is what things are like in Hong 
Kong and here are visual politic.

72
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:50,630
We're going to continue to pay close 
attention to the developing situation.

73
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:53,270
So do not forget to subscribe if you 
haven't already.

74
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,970
So now that this 20th anniversary has 
taken place,

75
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,150
there are some questions that we can't 
help but ask,

76
00:03:59,180 --> 00:04:01,520
how did Hong Kong do in the last 20 
years?

77
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,530
Has It changed much then?
Well,

78
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,660
what is the current situation?
Well,

79
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:06,980
let's have a look at all of that.

80
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,470
Calm.
Is Sill Hong Kong

81
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,300
best news off to these 20 years?
Is that Hong Kong?

82
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,163
Well,
it's still simply is Hong Kong a city 

83
00:04:21,890 --> 00:04:24,250
completely difference compared to the 
rest of China?

84
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:25,240
Let me elaborate on that.

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,113
Swamp

86
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:32,123
Hong Kong,
it's still the wealthiest and freest 

87
00:04:34,021 --> 00:04:36,840
city in China.
The course works and media are not under

88
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:40,080
the control of censorship and political 
debates is vibrant.

89
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,080
Vibrant is enough of the facts of the 
protests against China.

90
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:44,670
They're quite frequent.
In fact,

91
00:04:44,671 --> 00:04:45,504
a demonstration for freedom with more 
than 60,000 people against Tszujing 

92
00:04:48,361 --> 00:04:50,580
things.
Visits is a good example of this.

93
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:54,960
Furthermore,
during these years,

94
00:04:54,961 --> 00:04:55,794
economic growth has been an average of 
3.3% every year and well this is a 

95
00:04:59,731 --> 00:05:00,564
decent figure.
Now it might not be as high as in some 

96
00:05:02,791 --> 00:05:06,600
other Asian countries like Singapore or 
some non Asian countries like Ireland,

97
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:11,070
but this is still higher than the growth
rate of most rich countries.

98
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:11,963
In fact,
during this time that more than 1 

99
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:15,290
million Chinese have moved to Hong Kong 
in search of it,

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,133
that's a future.
The city has also cemented his position 

101
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,790
as a leading global financial center.

102
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,503
The number of publicly listed companies 
on the exchange has increased three 

103
00:05:24,881 --> 00:05:25,714
times since 1997 and market 
capitalization reached three point 2 

104
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:33,700
trillion by 2016 that's equal to almost 
all of Germany's GDP.

105
00:05:34,460 --> 00:05:36,570
I'll stay with 60 million tourists a 
year.

106
00:05:36,571 --> 00:05:40,350
Hong Kong has also become quite a power 
in the tourist sacks.

107
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:42,210
Oh,
hold on for just a second.

108
00:05:42,211 --> 00:05:43,044
Because the country is also showing 
symptoms which could indicate that the 

109
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,310
model is getting obsolete.

110
00:05:47,730 --> 00:05:52,440
[inaudible]

111
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,200
downfall of a single model.

112
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:56,310
It is

113
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:57,980
true that economic growth on this

114
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:58,813
island has been decent,
but it's also true that it has slowed 

115
00:06:01,461 --> 00:06:04,200
down with time for that savings of 
collapsed in the future.

116
00:06:04,201 --> 00:06:07,640
It just seems worse and not just for the
political situation.

117
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:10,760
This is probably the worst time in 20 
years for Hong Kong.

118
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,833
John's Hong,
Choon wa former financial secretary of 

119
00:06:14,211 --> 00:06:17,480
Hong Kong.
There is an increasing feeling that Hong

120
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,313
Kong hasn't succeeded in adapting to the
modern economic environments or that 

121
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,223
there is a risk of them being a source 
of cheap tacky theme park for 

122
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:26,084
businessmen and tourists.
It's like maybe it's the cities of the 

123
00:06:28,341 --> 00:06:29,174
pell river delta where the lack of 
drawing from Hong Kong can really be 

124
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:32,264
better understood.
This is the region which Hong Kong 

125
00:06:33,981 --> 00:06:34,814
belongs to you and traditionally the 
city has been the center of attention 

126
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,510
today.
This,

127
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,730
it's just not the case anymore.
I mean,

128
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,420
take a look at Shen Zen for example.
Yes,

129
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,713
Chinese city wasn't nothing but a poor 
fishing town of 50,000 inhabitants 50 

130
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:49,944
years ago.
Today the city is actually massive with 

131
00:06:52,021 --> 00:06:54,300
a population of more than 15 million 
people.

132
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:59,040
It also has as many companies in the 
fortune 500 as Hong Kong is an important

133
00:06:59,041 --> 00:06:59,874
high tech center,
which holds many notable companies like 

134
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:03,353
Penn and

135
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:06,920
and now many believe that it is Shen 
Zen,

136
00:07:06,921 --> 00:07:07,754
not Hong Kong,
who is destined to be the major player 

137
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,950
in the area and also considered this 
other stats.

138
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,940
In 1997 Hong Kong represented 20% of the
Chinese economy.

139
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:20,620
Today that figure is less than 3% this 
illustrates,

140
00:07:20,690 --> 00:07:21,523
well just how much things are changing.
Hong Kong's economy is stuck with 

141
00:07:25,071 --> 00:07:28,280
remarkably little change to show for the
past two decades.

142
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,293
Simon cartlidge and the truth is no.
If this has very little to do with luck 

143
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,733
Hong Kong,
it has made a significant mistakes so 

144
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:37,040
well,
the question might now be,

145
00:07:37,090 --> 00:07:38,300
well,
one of the major one.

146
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,520
Well these two,
there are a great place to start.

147
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,960
First there's the housing markets which 
has the hotel design.

148
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:44,963
Awesome

149
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:48,530
real estate prices in Hong Kong have 
gone through the ceiling.

150
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:49,423
The prices have gone so crazy that most 
of its citizens knew that the only 

151
00:07:51,951 --> 00:07:55,520
chance they have of getting a house is 
to get a public one and the odds of that

152
00:07:55,521 --> 00:07:56,630
happening,
oh really,

153
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:57,464
really low

154
00:07:59,070 --> 00:07:59,903
antonoff houses available.
All spaces become very expensive and 

155
00:08:02,641 --> 00:08:03,474
this makes it complicated for startups 
and new companies to establish 

156
00:08:06,181 --> 00:08:10,440
themselves in Hong Kong.
This triggers crazy situations like this

157
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:11,274
one Hong Kong parking space sells for 
record $664,300 and the problem here is 

158
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:21,180
not a lack of lands,
not at all.

159
00:08:21,181 --> 00:08:22,014
In fact less than 25% of Hong Kong 
surface area is urbanized and there are 

160
00:08:25,681 --> 00:08:29,040
other possibilities like using the seat 
plans.

161
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:31,470
It's really not the issue.
The Hong Kong,

162
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,333
it has a very free economy but freest in
the world according to the index of 

163
00:08:35,131 --> 00:08:38,670
economic freedom.
But it is not free when it comes to land

164
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:39,653
housing and town planning in Hong Kong.
The governments is the one in charge of 

165
00:08:42,811 --> 00:08:43,644
the housing sector and it has become a 
complete failure in the last few 

166
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,413
decades.
There are over 200 hectares of land 

167
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:51,570
available for building in the urban 
areas.

168
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:52,493
The shortage of housing is real,
but that is because of deliberate 

169
00:08:54,421 --> 00:08:56,430
manipulation of the market by the 
government.

170
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,833
John White,
a barrister and chairman of Friends of 

171
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,924
cycle pay close attention yet because 
housing developments have been frozen 

172
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,900
because of law from the colonial times 
for decades,

173
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:09,960
the local government least farmer's land
in order to grow rice.

174
00:09:09,961 --> 00:09:14,610
These communities support the government
in Beijing and nobody wants to mess with

175
00:09:14,611 --> 00:09:15,444
them.
It really is a totally crazy system and 

176
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,640
some people are suspicious band.
They have good reasons to be.

177
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:21,503
The government may have tried to go on a
fever from some oligarchs with big real 

178
00:09:24,631 --> 00:09:25,464
estate deals.
Some convictions have actually shown 

179
00:09:28,441 --> 00:09:29,274
this corruption and of confirms the 
suspicious links between government 

180
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,800
workers and the real estate magnets of 
Hong Kong.

181
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:36,833
This might explain why seven of the 14 
richest real estate investors off from 

182
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:40,830
home

183
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:41,663
calm.

184
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:44,643
This leads us on to another issue and 
that's the growing amount of crony 

185
00:09:47,681 --> 00:09:48,514
capitalism.

186
00:09:53,030 --> 00:09:53,380
Okay.

187
00:09:53,380 --> 00:09:58,380
Uncertain people agree capitalism has 
lost its strength in the last years to a

188
00:10:00,091 --> 00:10:00,924
system with a similar name but a totally
different essence and that system is 

189
00:10:04,741 --> 00:10:09,590
crony capitalism.
Under the British,

190
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,230
the government was pro business but not 
of business.

191
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:15,920
Since 1997 business interests have been 
baked into the political system.

192
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,860
Conflicts of interest of multiplied 
cronyism has grown,

193
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,000
okay

194
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:20,833
in many sectors,
competition has been replaced by well 

195
00:10:22,761 --> 00:10:23,594
connected oligopolies and monopolies and
the worst thing is that things are 

196
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:27,344
getting worse.
It was trying to raise regaining its 

197
00:10:29,091 --> 00:10:32,030
power in the city as an example of the 
liaison office,

198
00:10:32,031 --> 00:10:32,864
which is like the Chinese delegation,
that is even giving out loans with 

199
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:40,040
better conditions to friendly companies 
in order to increase their influence and

200
00:10:40,041 --> 00:10:40,874
their political power and what to know 
what's required in order to get one of 

201
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,234
these loans well you need to have 
connections and some make all of this 

202
00:10:48,591 --> 00:10:49,424
worse.
This is all surrounded by the political 

203
00:10:50,631 --> 00:10:53,030
conflict that we've already told you 
about.

204
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,820
Anyway,
it is carry lambs and mission to address

205
00:10:55,821 --> 00:10:59,150
all these problems.
Her legitimacy is also questionable.

206
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:01,490
After all,
she wasn't elected by the citizens.

207
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:06,100
She was elected by a group of people who
are led by Beijing's directive.

208
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:09,370
It's fine.

209
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,453
There was this time of year when Hong 
Kong was thought to be the city on the 

210
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:16,010
hill for China's political change.
Unfortunately,

211
00:11:16,011 --> 00:11:19,580
they things look quite different 
nowadays and the question becomes,

212
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,160
what will the future of Hong Kong be 
like?

213
00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:25,040
Will it be in the light?
What would it be in the shadows?

214
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,240
Well,
now it's your turn.

215
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:27,074
