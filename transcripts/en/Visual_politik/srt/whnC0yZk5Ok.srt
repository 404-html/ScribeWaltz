1
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:11,600
The word brexit has become a synonym for
apocalypse for most of media,

2
00:00:11,660 --> 00:00:12,493
at least the media outside of the UK.
There are many things to be said about 

3
00:00:15,501 --> 00:00:16,334
this,
but today we're going to focus on this 

4
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:24,680
Goldman Sachs to move hundreds of its 
staff out of London,

5
00:00:24,980 --> 00:00:27,620
and this is just one example,
but at the time we're making this video,

6
00:00:27,621 --> 00:00:28,454
20 banks have already announced that 
they will move part of their staff out 

7
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:31,994
of the UK.
The most optimistic estimations claimed 

8
00:00:33,771 --> 00:00:34,604
that the city of London might lose over 
30,000 workers and the most pessimistic 

9
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:42,220
argue that this could be as high as 
$200,000.

10
00:00:42,260 --> 00:00:45,470
But wait just a minute here.
Why is this important?

11
00:00:45,650 --> 00:00:46,483
Well,
if you've been following visual politic 

12
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:48,164
for a while,
you already know that London is the 

13
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:50,473
global financial capital.
More specifically that global financial 

14
00:00:52,851 --> 00:00:56,720
capital would be the city of London,
also known as the square mile.

15
00:00:56,830 --> 00:00:57,663
Square mile is essentially a city inside
of a city where most of the 

16
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:02,330
international banks have their 
headquarters.

17
00:01:05,010 --> 00:01:06,060
Yes.
Even after Brexit,

18
00:01:06,061 --> 00:01:06,894
it is possible that London will keep it 
sway on the markets in Asia and even 

19
00:01:09,961 --> 00:01:10,794
America,
but so far European business accounts 

20
00:01:12,781 --> 00:01:17,160
for 35 percent of the city's workloads 
and of course leaving the European Union

21
00:01:17,161 --> 00:01:20,850
is going to have some consequences.
While now you might be wondering,

22
00:01:20,851 --> 00:01:22,470
well,
why are these banks going to go?

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:25,410
Which city will be the new financial 
capital after London?

24
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:26,790
Well,
often monster competition.

25
00:01:26,791 --> 00:01:28,630
It does seem as if we do finally have

26
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:29,723
winner

27
00:01:33,250 --> 00:01:36,730
and other companies plan expansion in 
Frankfurt after brexit.

28
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:37,803
So far this is a Frankfurt is going to 
become the new financial powerhouse in 

29
00:01:40,631 --> 00:01:44,230
Europe and perhaps one of the most 
important in the entire world,

30
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:47,890
but what does Frankfurt's sap that other
cities like Madrid or Paris don't?

31
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:50,770
Well today we are going to answer this 
question,

32
00:01:50,771 --> 00:01:53,050
but before we do,
let's look back at the history.

33
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:00,410
Why are banks leaving the city?

34
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:03,240
The city of London is an area of about a
square mile.

35
00:02:03,270 --> 00:02:06,390
See where the name comes from,
which is located inside broader London.

36
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:08,490
They have their own laws.
They have their own mayor.

37
00:02:08,491 --> 00:02:10,350
They even have their own police.
Little bit

38
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,130
base is the home for the main 
international banks.

39
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:16,400
Three hundred thousand people work here 
and have this 300,000,

40
00:02:16,430 --> 00:02:17,263
60,000 European immigrants who entered 
the country thanks to being part of the 

41
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,460
European Union

42
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,680
and okay,
my countrymen,

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,030
I know where you're thinking.
Despite being an EU country,

44
00:02:26,031 --> 00:02:29,120
the UK never was really insight.
The free circulation area.

45
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:32,270
This means that theoretically the 
British government could have closed the

46
00:02:32,271 --> 00:02:34,700
borders to all those immigrants sit 
anytime they want it,

47
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:35,563
but in practice,
European citizens we're getting in and 

48
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,960
out of the country as they pleased.

49
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:39,823
It's clear that EU migration to the UK 
has increased significantly over the 

50
00:02:42,771 --> 00:02:45,350
last two decades.
In Twenty 15,

51
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:47,930
they were just over 3 million people 
living in the UK.

52
00:02:47,931 --> 00:02:48,764
You were born in other EU countries and 
increase of about one point 9 million 

53
00:02:51,951 --> 00:02:54,270
since 2003.
Nevertheless,

54
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:59,160
things they are getting exchanged for 
the questions to the prime minister,

55
00:02:59,210 --> 00:03:01,700
he British Prime Minister,
conservative Theresa may hold,

56
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:02,940
holds an extremely weak

57
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:03,893
position.

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,600
This is despite the fact that she won 
the general election in June,

59
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,930
she just lost a large number of seats in
the parliament doing that.

60
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:13,973
In fact,
it's not even clear if she's going to 

61
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:16,200
finish that time.
Of course,

62
00:03:16,230 --> 00:03:17,063
people from in and out of their party,
they are pushing her to increase 

63
00:03:20,161 --> 00:03:21,420
immigration controls.

64
00:03:21,550 --> 00:03:22,383
I've consistently said that the 
referendum vote was a vote for us to 

65
00:03:25,481 --> 00:03:26,314
change that freedom of movement with a 
vote for us to bring control into our 

66
00:03:29,171 --> 00:03:31,870
immigration system for people coming 
from the European Union.

67
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:33,820
There's a variety of ways in which that 
can be done.

68
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,470
This would have a big impact in the city
of London.

69
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:37,363
Indeed,
a bigger impacts than anywhere else in 

70
00:03:38,511 --> 00:03:40,580
the UK.
As we said in another video.

71
00:03:40,581 --> 00:03:41,414
Positive London success comes from their
ability to attract talent from all over 

72
00:03:44,961 --> 00:03:45,794
the wells,
but if the government closes its doors 

73
00:03:47,421 --> 00:03:48,254
to foreigners,
those banks you hire immigrants will 

74
00:03:50,121 --> 00:03:53,810
have it to significantly harder than 
before and make no mistake.

75
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,320
This is not only due to brexit.
In fact,

76
00:03:56,330 --> 00:03:57,163
the anti immigrant sentiment in the UK,
it's been going well beyond the borders 

77
00:04:00,591 --> 00:04:01,640
of the European Union.

78
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,250
Theresa

79
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,083
may discharge companies 2000 pounds per 
year for each non European Union worker 

80
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,173
they employ,
but wasting it because there's still 

81
00:04:15,071 --> 00:04:15,940
more,
as I said,

82
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:16,774
Theresa May and so Conservative Party 
have lost a good share of the seats in 

83
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:22,000
parliament as well.
Where did those seats go?

84
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:23,620
Well,
they went to the Labor policy.

85
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:24,543
A policy leader,
Jeremy Corbyn has declared war on the 

86
00:04:27,341 --> 00:04:32,341
backs on his election manifesto.
He already proposed things like this for

87
00:04:35,261 --> 00:04:37,810
cultural UK financial transaction tax

88
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:41,503
until now.
This tax was one of the biggest 

89
00:04:42,801 --> 00:04:45,830
advantages that UK had over the EU.
As you might know,

90
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:46,693
Brussels has been for years debating the
possibility of having a financial 

91
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:50,924
transaction tax.
This is something bankers really don't 

92
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:57,890
wants and no one really wants to pay,
but if the UK parliament ends up passing

93
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,724
such a law,
a lot of companies will be wondering if 

94
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,810
they still want to keep their offices in
London.

95
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,780
In other words,
even if the brexit negotiations ended up

96
00:05:05,781 --> 00:05:06,614
being great for the UK interests,
the ad is still becoming more and more 

97
00:05:09,921 --> 00:05:12,770
poisonous for the UKS financial 
industry,

98
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,663
and this explains why so many banks are 
starting to think about opening offices 

99
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:17,420
outside of the.

100
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:18,463
Okay.

101
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,690
Now the question is why are they 
choosing Frankfurt?

102
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,783
Well,
let's have a look at that financial 

103
00:05:29,931 --> 00:05:30,764
capital.
On the very day after the brexit 

104
00:05:31,941 --> 00:05:32,774
referendum,
the race to take over London as the 

105
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:37,040
global financial capital started,
for example,

106
00:05:37,041 --> 00:05:37,874
in Spain,
the regional governments of Madrid 

107
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:42,770
launched their own advertising campaign,
designed to attract bankers,

108
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:46,503
even the Finance Minister Luis held 
personal meetings with executives from 

109
00:05:49,691 --> 00:05:53,380
jp Morgan and elsewhere to offer special
tax conditions in Paris.

110
00:05:53,381 --> 00:05:56,890
Emmanuel macron had already announced 
lower taxes for banks in order to hinder

111
00:05:56,891 --> 00:05:59,240
them from London,
but I'm sorry guys,

112
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,570
it's really hard to beat the India.
Frankly.

113
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,600
Standard Charter Plc,

114
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:10,410
Nomura Holdings Inc and Di was 
securities group Inc,

115
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,303
have all picked Germany's financial 
capital for their EU base to ensure 

116
00:06:15,031 --> 00:06:18,470
continued access to the single market.
But if you want to stay wealthy,

117
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,170
which would help us and fun food city 
group,

118
00:06:22,470 --> 00:06:26,250
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley are 
weighing a similar decision.

119
00:06:26,450 --> 00:06:29,070
But what's so special about this city?
Well,

120
00:06:29,071 --> 00:06:29,851
first of all,
frank,

121
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:30,684
that already has the headquarters of the
European Central Bank as well as other 

122
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,474
big banks like Deutsche Bank.
This means that they already have the 

123
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:37,714
network effects.
We always mentioned here a visual 

124
00:06:39,011 --> 00:06:39,844
politic.
They have lots of other things like 

125
00:06:40,691 --> 00:06:41,800
startups,
law firms,

126
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:45,250
consultancy,
etc. Besides frankfurt has many business

127
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,084
schools with international prestige as 
well as the university under the second 

128
00:06:49,001 --> 00:06:49,834
biggest airport in europe,
you know have in front foot like a form 

129
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:58,220
that chinese companies,
we have like 800 turkish companies,

130
00:06:58,940 --> 00:06:59,773
1000 companies from United States.
Only the rate of the english companies 

131
00:07:04,751 --> 00:07:05,584
is quite little.
But this will change from my point of 

132
00:07:07,941 --> 00:07:10,340
view automatically.
If this was not enough,

133
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:13,610
70 percent of the german population 
speak english fluently.

134
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:14,473
This means those british banks can send 
their managers to Frankfurt old 

135
00:07:16,881 --> 00:07:17,714
international meetings and even hire 
locals without having to worry about 

136
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,880
language.
If you think this is not important,

137
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:23,773
good luck trying to find the same setup 
and France were only 39 percent of the 

138
00:07:27,621 --> 00:07:30,200
population speaks.
Shakespeare's language,

139
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,093
not to mention Spain,
where this percentage is lower than 25 

140
00:07:33,591 --> 00:07:34,424
percent.

141
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:38,550
Hold on a minute because there is still 
more,

142
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:42,630
as I said in a previous video,
Germany is a d at centralized country.

143
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:46,770
This means regional governments and 
trade unions have way more autonomy here

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,920
than they have in any other country.
Thanks to this political architecture,

145
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,570
the region of hessen where frankfurt is.
Locators can offer things like this.

146
00:07:57,450 --> 00:07:59,910
Labor laws make it difficult to fire 
people.

147
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:00,893
Frankfurt had initially proposed a 
change in labor laws that would either 

148
00:08:04,411 --> 00:08:08,310
exempt bankers or high income earners 
more generally from the rules.

149
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:10,560
Okay.
Now let's think about something else.

150
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,453
If you have a bank guns,
he wants to set up your offices 

151
00:08:12,691 --> 00:08:15,060
somewhere.
What is the first thing you will need?

152
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:16,830
Well,
that would be a building.

153
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,620
You need a physical place where you can 
put your offices.

154
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:22,680
Well in this regard,
frankfurt is better suited than anywhere

155
00:08:22,681 --> 00:08:24,100
else you see.
After world war two,

156
00:08:24,150 --> 00:08:26,520
frankfurt,
it was totally destroyed and they had to

157
00:08:26,521 --> 00:08:29,250
rebuild it almost nothing and other 
german cities,

158
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:30,143
urban laws for the building of 
skyscrapers in order to maintain the 

159
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,470
uniform,
more traditional skyline,

160
00:08:34,471 --> 00:08:35,304
but not in frankfurt.
Here you can make buildings as high as 

161
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:38,483
you want.

162
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:47,140
This explains why despite a population 
of less than 1 million inhabitants,

163
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:50,020
frankfurt looks like a big metropolis.
Further,

164
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:53,110
Germany asked one of the cheapest real 
estate markets in all of europe.

165
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,790
Despite the high salaries,
houses,

166
00:08:54,791 --> 00:08:55,624
rents square meters are half the price 
of paris and a fraction of the cost of 

167
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:03,741
london.
Okay?

168
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,700
Okay.
But now I know what you're thinking.

169
00:09:05,701 --> 00:09:06,720
I mean,
come on simon.

170
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:09,450
What about corporate taxes and this is 
the most important thing of all.

171
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,493
Well yeah,
I know Germany has a corporate tax that 

172
00:09:12,331 --> 00:09:15,120
in some cases reaches 30 percent by 
comparison.

173
00:09:15,121 --> 00:09:17,400
The uk is at 20 and you're absolutely 
right,

174
00:09:17,401 --> 00:09:19,350
but the devil here,
it's really in the details.

175
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:20,363
Do you ever.
How I said the gemini is highly 

176
00:09:21,121 --> 00:09:21,960
decentralized.
Well,

177
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:24,390
this applies to corporate tax to in this
country,

178
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:27,180
corporate tax.
It's divided into two parts and national

179
00:09:27,181 --> 00:09:29,660
and a regional one.
This means that the federal government's

180
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:32,870
gets only 15 percent of the tax.
The rest depends on the

181
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:33,753
region.

182
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:40,120
This means technically the state of 
hessen where frankfurt is really has the

183
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:44,920
ability to reduce this tax a lot and of 
course doing this mice and more and more

184
00:09:44,921 --> 00:09:47,980
british bankers that I'm finally,
if none of this was enough of you,

185
00:09:48,010 --> 00:09:52,150
here comes the big finale,
the financial transaction tax.

186
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:53,620
This was the tax bill you mentioned 
before.

187
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:56,260
That scares away so many bankers.
That tax,

188
00:09:56,261 --> 00:09:59,320
at least in europe,
has about as many loopholes as possible.

189
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:02,620
There are so many exceptions on this tax
that Even its biggest supporter,

190
00:10:02,670 --> 00:10:03,503
the german finance minister had this to 
say humanist swiss cheese needs more 

191
00:10:09,551 --> 00:10:12,040
than holes or has to be something in 
between them.

192
00:10:12,130 --> 00:10:15,640
Otherwise it's just a hole,
not a swiss cheese.

193
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,960
Wolfgang schauble.

194
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:19,953
So now we have a question for you.
Imagine you are the manager of one of 

195
00:10:22,811 --> 00:10:24,730
these london banks.
What would you do?

196
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:25,593
Would you remain in london or perhaps 
would you move your offices to 

197
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:28,091
frankfurt?
Well,

198
00:10:28,091 --> 00:10:30,160
do let us know in the comments below.
