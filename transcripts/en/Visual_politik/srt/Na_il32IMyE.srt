1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,610
If I asked you what the largest 
ecommerce company in the world was,

2
00:00:02,611 --> 00:00:05,970
I bet most of you would answer Amazon 
without even hesitating.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:07,830
However,
that might not actually be the case.

4
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:08,723
Listen Up,

5
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:25,440
Ali Baba started 18 years ago.
We never change.

6
00:00:25,441 --> 00:00:27,450
I'll a drink.
We believe e commerce.

7
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:28,583
We believe Internet.
We've been lead by helping young people 

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:35,040
helping small business and helping 
empower women.

9
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,600
We will have the future

10
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:42,593
his value of more than $400 billion in 
more than 600 million customers 

11
00:00:45,601 --> 00:00:48,750
worldwide.
Ali Baba is an incredible success story.

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,000
That's all.
Say the most valuable Chinese company in

13
00:00:51,001 --> 00:00:51,834
the world.
We can say that this company has become 

14
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:56,880
the best representative of the new form 
of Chinese capitalism.

15
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:04,253
Let's go back for a second.
Is the question that we asked at the 

16
00:01:05,881 --> 00:01:06,714
beginning of this video.
Is Amazon the largest ECOMMERCE company 

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:10,200
in the world?
Well,

18
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:15,290
that kind of depends.
For example,

19
00:01:18,151 --> 00:01:18,984
we take a look at the market value.
That is how much investors value the 

20
00:01:21,301 --> 00:01:22,134
company asks.
Then undoubtedly Amazon is the largest 

21
00:01:24,361 --> 00:01:26,940
company,
but if instead we focus on the volume of

22
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:28,890
sales made through the company every 
year,

23
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,140
that is where more goods are bought and 
sold.

24
00:01:31,290 --> 00:01:34,410
Then Alibaba wins by a landslide.

25
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,450
Yes.

26
00:01:37,450 --> 00:01:41,110
Salad Baba might not be as popular as 
well known as Amazon after all.

27
00:01:41,111 --> 00:01:45,220
It mostly works in the Asian markets,
but although it may seem far away,

28
00:01:45,221 --> 00:01:50,221
products worth a total of more than $750
billion I sold each year through Alibaba

29
00:01:50,931 --> 00:01:51,850
has different platform.

30
00:01:55,330 --> 00:01:56,163
Nope.

31
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,743
[inaudible] of you who usually follow 
visual politics surely won't be 

32
00:01:59,451 --> 00:02:02,780
surprised by what I'm saying.
Asia is undergoing a revolution,

33
00:02:02,781 --> 00:02:06,080
a take off an unprecedented economic 
growth process.

34
00:02:06,830 --> 00:02:07,470
Every week,

35
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:08,303
year around 160 million people leave 
poverty behinds and managed to become a 

36
00:02:11,711 --> 00:02:12,544
part of the middle class.
160 million people in Asia alone in the 

37
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:16,863
next few years.
Countries like the Philippines and 

38
00:02:17,531 --> 00:02:18,364
Thailand are going to have a middle 
classes as large as those in the United 

39
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,281
Kingdom,
France,

40
00:02:22,281 --> 00:02:23,114
the recipe and then there's China.
He's middle class is absolutely 

41
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:28,060
exploding.
It's taking off almost vertical.

42
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,153
Okay.

43
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,070
What happens when a person leaves 
poverty behind and becomes a part of the

44
00:02:34,071 --> 00:02:35,150
middle class?
Well,

45
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:36,013
among other things,
it means they now have much more money 

46
00:02:37,881 --> 00:02:38,714
just fence.
This explains why their trainees retail 

47
00:02:40,431 --> 00:02:41,264
market is multiplied by four in the last
five years and why forecasts indicates 

48
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:45,703
that the growth Chinese consumption in 
the next three to four years will be 

49
00:02:47,901 --> 00:02:52,250
greater than everything the British or 
Germans consume today.

50
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,450
Do you know who holds both in 70% of the
share in China's ecommerce sector and is

51
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:05,170
very well positioned in the other 
fastest growing Asian countries?

52
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,033
Yup.
That's Alibaba to partnerships with 

53
00:03:07,370 --> 00:03:08,203
Alibaba.
Canadian producers have been able to 

54
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:15,001
sell their innovative technologies,
apparel and quality fresh food to almost

55
00:03:16,810 --> 00:03:17,643
half a billion Chinese customers.
I'm sure by now you're beginning to see 

56
00:03:20,381 --> 00:03:22,580
this company in a rather different

57
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,543
light.

58
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:29,483
Oh,
we take a look at Alibaba has 

59
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:33,470
characteristics.
It's lice and its dark sides.

60
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:37,430
Let's see how it all began.
Let's have a look at the history.

61
00:03:44,050 --> 00:03:45,400
Jack Ma's mirror

62
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:46,743
coleman.

63
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,060
Never the best student,
but thanks to the foreign tourists.

64
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:53,730
He visited his hometown and especially 
to the relationship he developed with an

65
00:03:53,731 --> 00:03:55,350
Australian family,
Jack Ma,

66
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,243
a child born in a humble family just two
years before Mao's cultural revolution 

67
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:03,240
managed to learn English and decried.
All the advantages offered by the modern

68
00:04:03,241 --> 00:04:07,440
world and as is often the case in life.
It wasn't formal studies,

69
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:08,274
but the small experiences,
the kind we often don't even pay 

70
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:14,670
attention to that fat.
The success of the person who is today,

71
00:04:14,671 --> 00:04:19,671
the richest man in all of China.
I'm 100% made in China.

72
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:23,580
I learned English myself.
I know nothing about technology.

73
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:24,473
One of the reasons why Alibaba survived 
is because I know nothing about 

74
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:28,584
computers.
I'm like a blind man riding on the back 

75
00:04:30,961 --> 00:04:33,090
of a blind tiger.
Jack Ma,

76
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:34,193
Jack Ma,
one of the heroes of the new modern 

77
00:04:35,641 --> 00:04:36,474
China,
didn't have the opportunity to attend a 

78
00:04:37,741 --> 00:04:38,574
good university.

79
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,050
However,
since he learned English,

80
00:04:40,051 --> 00:04:41,970
he managed to graduate with a teaching 
degree,

81
00:04:41,971 --> 00:04:42,804
got a job as a language teacher and a 
few years later launched a translation 

82
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,494
company and it was on a trip to the 
United States to perform a translation 

83
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:49,884
service that some friends from Seattle 
showed him what was then an incipient 

84
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,050
technology called the internet.
That moments,

85
00:04:55,051 --> 00:04:57,210
an idea had jack jacker right in the 
face.

86
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:01,110
I was afraid of touching the computer 
because it seemed very expensive,

87
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,640
but they said,
come on Jack,

88
00:05:02,641 --> 00:05:04,530
go ahead.
It's not a bomb.

89
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:06,840
Then I typed the word beer,
b,

90
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:07,713
e,
e r and I could see German and Japanese 

91
00:05:10,321 --> 00:05:12,270
beer,
but not Chinese spear.

92
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,750
Then I typed the word China and the 
answer was no results.

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,613
Then I thought,
how interesting if we could group all 

94
00:05:18,421 --> 00:05:20,820
the companies in China and create a page
for them,

95
00:05:20,910 --> 00:05:25,910
maybe that would achieve something big 
Jack Ma as that's precisely what he did.

96
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:27,580
After returning to China,
Jack said,

97
00:05:27,590 --> 00:05:29,750
Tata Company,
China pages to list,

98
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,541
classify,
classifying,

99
00:05:30,541 --> 00:05:33,900
thus find Chinese companies.
Something like the yellow pages.

100
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,450
This company didn't have the expected 
success,

101
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:37,284
but Jack Learns enough to be ready for 
his next adventure after a lot of work 

102
00:05:40,951 --> 00:05:42,780
in a small apartment,
but if he had a team,

103
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:43,614
had managed to train without virtually 
any resources created Alibaba in 1999 

104
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:50,490
and it's now one of the largest 
companies on the planet.

105
00:05:57,150 --> 00:05:57,983
Great.
Mark.

106
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:58,873
Good.

107
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,230
I'm wondering what Alibaba does,
we should ask ourselves what doesn't

108
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,203
because

109
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:08,203
see,
Alibaba isn't simply an ecommerce 

110
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,544
portal,
but rather are kind of technological 

111
00:06:12,381 --> 00:06:14,690
intermediary.
In other words,

112
00:06:14,691 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm like Amazon.
Alibaba doesn't sell anything directly,

113
00:06:17,481 --> 00:06:18,314
but basically functions as a large 
market where thousands and thousands of 

114
00:06:21,771 --> 00:06:22,604
brands,
producers and distribution companies 

115
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,630
sell their products to millions of 
customers.

116
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,820
That is,
Alibaba is the owner company,

117
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:31,260
the company that manages this huge 
market and supplies.

118
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,113
Everything that brands,
producers and distributors need to be 

119
00:06:34,131 --> 00:06:37,310
able to carry out their business from 
payment platforms to metadata.

120
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:42,140
This may be it's biggest difference from
Amazon.

121
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,840
For example,
think about the huge amount of data that

122
00:06:44,841 --> 00:06:46,850
these companies handle.
Consumer trends,

123
00:06:46,851 --> 00:06:48,350
budgets,
types of customers,

124
00:06:48,351 --> 00:06:49,370
purchase,
timing,

125
00:06:49,371 --> 00:06:50,210
et cetera.
Well,

126
00:06:50,211 --> 00:06:53,330
while Amazon uses all that data to 
develop his own product lines,

127
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:54,164
Alibaba shares them with the companies 
that operate through their markets so 

128
00:06:57,020 --> 00:07:01,070
that they can launch new products or no,
their consumers' preferences better runs

129
00:07:01,071 --> 00:07:02,030
with us,
sell more,

130
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:04,400
making the market grow,
which makes Alibaba Greg.

131
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:11,460
Thus overtime Alibaba has developed a 
several different markets,

132
00:07:11,461 --> 00:07:14,640
so if you'd like to better understand 
what Alibaba is exactly.

133
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:18,060
Let's take a look at what those markets 
are and how they differ.

134
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:21,170
First of all,
we have alibaba.com

135
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,033
the huge wholesale markets,
perhaps the largest online wholesale 

136
00:07:24,331 --> 00:07:25,164
markets on the planet.
That is to see this market isn't aimed 

137
00:07:27,331 --> 00:07:28,164
at consumers through this space.
Producers and manufacturers selling 

138
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:31,344
their products in Biloxi,
other companies so they can distribute 

139
00:07:33,691 --> 00:07:36,540
them in their countries.
For example,

140
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,550
say you have a store and you want to 
order 5,000

141
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:42,000
red shirts with a specific logo.
This is the place that you go to.

142
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:45,330
Unless we use Alibaba.
It's extremely difficult,

143
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,970
expensive,
and frustrating to find a supplier.

144
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,420
Alibaba cut out the middle man.
They make it extremely easy to find,

145
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,750
communicate and negotiate with suppliers
directly through their website.

146
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:58,020
J June businessmen and investor.
Then in China,

147
00:07:58,021 --> 00:07:59,910
in addition to the local wholesale 
markets,

148
00:07:59,911 --> 00:08:02,610
which in this case is known as 1680 
eight.com

149
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:03,503
Alibaba has two of the largest retail 
electronic commerce or markets in the 

150
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:08,910
country.
Taobao and teamwork.

151
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:12,120
Cool.
See,

152
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:15,720
Taobao is pretty much a combination 
between Amazon and Ebay.

153
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:16,613
Yeah.
Practically anyone can sell that 

154
00:08:17,941 --> 00:08:18,774
product.
It's a market with thousands and 

155
00:08:20,490 --> 00:08:23,550
thousands of suppliers and almost 600 
million active consumers.

156
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:26,213
Team old on the other hand,
is a large online shopping center 

157
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:28,913
oriented towards big brands.
The brands pay a fee to have their own 

158
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,080
store,
basically like any shopping mall.

159
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,170
Then one of the,
that's an old crown jewels.

160
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,033
Alibaba owns more than 80% of Lazada.
The most important ecommerce company in 

161
00:08:41,941 --> 00:08:42,774
South Asia.
This is a company that operates in 

162
00:08:43,831 --> 00:08:45,570
countries like Indonesia,
Vietnam,

163
00:08:45,571 --> 00:08:46,470
Malaysia,
Singapore,

164
00:08:46,471 --> 00:08:47,304
and Thailand.
And watch out because we aren't talking 

165
00:08:48,931 --> 00:08:51,990
about something small scale only in the 
next two to three years,

166
00:08:51,991 --> 00:08:55,390
these countries will see them 
middleclass multiplied by two discipline

167
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:57,090
us,
400 million people,

168
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,330
400 million people that Alibaba wants to
turn into customers.

169
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:04,550
And finally we have what is probably the
best known platform,

170
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:05,413
but most of us,
aliexpress and international consumer 

171
00:09:07,641 --> 00:09:10,550
oriented platform.
Well,

172
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,830
these folks are Alibaba has mean 
markets,

173
00:09:12,831 --> 00:09:13,664
but the company's activities end that 
Alibaba is also one of the five most 

174
00:09:19,641 --> 00:09:21,860
important power computing companies in 
the world.

175
00:09:21,861 --> 00:09:24,440
And of course it's trainers,
undisputed leader,

176
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:28,400
and this division is growth rate has 
surpassed 100% annually in recent yet

177
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:32,710
companies such as kpmg,
Nestle,

178
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:33,544
Phillips,
and sap already use hourly cloud 

179
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:40,140
services.
It also owns Yukui streaming platform,

180
00:09:40,141 --> 00:09:42,150
similar to youtube,
ele.me,

181
00:09:42,151 --> 00:09:42,984
China's largest home delivery company,
which among many other companies also 

182
00:09:45,511 --> 00:09:47,460
holds a significant share of.
Why though?

183
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:51,510
Something like the Chinese facebook,
but just a second,

184
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:54,630
have any of you heard of Ali pay for 
those who don't know what it is?

185
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:55,464
Hourly pay is very similar to paypal.
It has more than 817 million active 

186
00:09:58,651 --> 00:09:59,484
users.
And there's the leader in the Chinese 

187
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:01,560
mobile payment market.

188
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:03,663
Yes.

189
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,980
See,
in China,

190
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:06,814
credit cards aren't common at all.
The trainees have jumped directly to 

191
00:10:09,821 --> 00:10:12,010
mobile payments,
so when they go to the supermarket,

192
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:13,930
instead of paying with visa or 
mastercard,

193
00:10:13,931 --> 00:10:16,480
they use Ali pay or we chats payment 
services.

194
00:10:16,481 --> 00:10:19,240
The two main payment systems in the 
Chinese market,

195
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:20,133
while Alibaba owns 33% of ANZ financial,
the company that owns alipay and also 

196
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:28,240
pate and the leading mobile payments 
application in India.

197
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,103
And I've a strongly growing markets.
To give you an idea of what this means 

198
00:10:31,601 --> 00:10:36,190
as financials,
estimated value surpasses $150 billion.

199
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,280
Just a moment,
because if this entire online bet wasn't

200
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:42,114
enough,
Alibaba is also investing billions in 

201
00:10:43,891 --> 00:10:47,340
supermarkets and other physical stores 
where it has its own brand.

202
00:10:47,390 --> 00:10:51,390
Hema is also the largest shareholder in 
the sun art retail group,

203
00:10:51,391 --> 00:10:54,530
the largest supermarkets and 
hypermarkets operator in all of it,

204
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:55,403
China.

205
00:10:56,750 --> 00:10:57,583
So as you can see,
the Alibaba or empire extends its 

206
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:02,640
tentacles into a lot of Saturday things 
up.

207
00:11:02,641 --> 00:11:05,430
Alibaba has services equivalent to those
of Amazon,

208
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,210
Ebay,
Justi,

209
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,080
visa,
youtube,

210
00:11:07,081 --> 00:11:07,914
facebook,
and even cough or all in the same 

211
00:11:09,811 --> 00:11:11,610
company.
Certainly not bad.

212
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:12,533
Well,
this is precisely why this company is 

213
00:11:13,621 --> 00:11:17,070
worth more than $400 billion on the 
stock market,

214
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,030
but I don't think we can end this story 
without talking about the future.

215
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:26,880
[inaudible]

216
00:11:28,450 --> 00:11:33,310
risks and opportunities.
If we look at it,

217
00:11:33,311 --> 00:11:35,210
Alibaba has plans,
very ambitious,

218
00:11:37,820 --> 00:11:38,510
bye.

219
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,343
20 sales made through Alibaba is 
different platforms will exceed $1 

220
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:43,843
trillion just 18 years.
The company aims to surpass 2 billion 

221
00:11:50,701 --> 00:11:51,534
customers.

222
00:11:59,050 --> 00:11:59,480
Sorry.

223
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:00,480
Yeah,
that's the goal,

224
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,060
but will they achieve it?
Well,

225
00:12:02,061 --> 00:12:02,894
obviously we can't know,
but the truth is that it has many cards 

226
00:12:04,941 --> 00:12:05,840
on the table.
See,

227
00:12:05,870 --> 00:12:06,703
despite this company's huge growth since
its foundation in 1999 it still has 

228
00:12:10,461 --> 00:12:11,510
great potential.
No,

229
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:12,353
do I need,
because ecommerce is growing a lot 

230
00:12:13,611 --> 00:12:14,444
around the welds,
but also because everything indicates 

231
00:12:16,101 --> 00:12:19,160
that growth will be explosive for many 
years,

232
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,900
particularly in this region.

233
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:23,990
Let's take a look at it.
For example,

234
00:12:24,010 --> 00:12:25,990
China.
Alibaba is a main market here.

235
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:30,720
The Internet has only expanded by 55% so
there's still a lot of work to do.

236
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:31,583
We're talking about hundreds of millions
of people who will sooner or later 

237
00:12:34,051 --> 00:12:37,710
connect to the Internet and start making
that first online purchases.

238
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,243
I'm not only that,
given that Chinese purchasing power is 

239
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:42,954
growing stronger year after year,
the same is happening with the average 

240
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:46,703
amount of purchases.
See it since 2015 the average Ali Baba 

241
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,920
customers spending has grown by 50% in 
China.

242
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:55,530
So if we combine more spending and more 
clients,

243
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:56,393
well,
you can see how enormous the potential 

244
00:12:58,171 --> 00:12:59,004
is here.
And then in addition that rob the 

245
00:13:02,401 --> 00:13:06,510
countries which belonged to the 
Association of Southeast Asian Nations,

246
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:09,540
also India,
we're talking about an area of the world

247
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:11,850
that is not only going to see a huge 
economic growth,

248
00:13:11,851 --> 00:13:12,684
but it's also estimated to grow by more 
than 700 million people in the next 

249
00:13:15,811 --> 00:13:18,210
three decades.
All of this is of course,

250
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:20,430
in addition to the international market.
Now,

251
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:23,040
hold on a second,
because everything's not so rosy.

252
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:23,903
Like many Internet companies who focus 
all their attention on growing and 

253
00:13:26,221 --> 00:13:27,054
growing,
the company isn't actually making much 

254
00:13:28,351 --> 00:13:29,184
money.

255
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:38,923
Okay.
So we're talking about a $400 billion 

256
00:13:40,551 --> 00:13:41,384
company that has barely managed to make 
a net profit of eight point $4 billion 

257
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,194
in the last 12 months.
And that might sound like a lot of 

258
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,180
money,
but the market value is 50 times in that

259
00:13:50,181 --> 00:13:51,560
profit.
And that's a lot.

260
00:13:51,650 --> 00:13:52,940
And of course one may think,
well,

261
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:53,351
okay,
yeah.

262
00:13:53,351 --> 00:13:54,320
Okay,
but so what,

263
00:13:54,321 --> 00:13:56,150
I mean it's definitely gonna make money 
in the future.

264
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:58,730
Well,
maybe or maybe not,

265
00:13:58,820 --> 00:13:59,653
because if the market grows so much,
it usually entails a very strong 

266
00:14:01,881 --> 00:14:04,400
incentives for you competitors,
new rivals,

267
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,910
something that is already happening in a
certain,

268
00:14:06,911 --> 00:14:07,744
yeah.

269
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:09,063
Okay.

270
00:14:09,260 --> 00:14:10,640
Competitors like J d.
Dot.

271
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:14,360
Coleman does specialty pin duo duo are 
investing a lot of money to compete with

272
00:14:14,361 --> 00:14:17,330
Alibaba,
even though they aren't very successful,

273
00:14:17,331 --> 00:14:19,880
they may never beat Alibaba are off.
Maybe they will.

274
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,790
The truth is that the massive water,
it adds more pressure to the markets,

275
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:26,480
which may reduce the margins in which 
these companies operate in the future.

276
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:27,433
John,

277
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:30,590
of course,
there's the Chinese government,

278
00:14:30,591 --> 00:14:33,500
which as you know,
is not exactly the best guarantor in the

279
00:14:33,501 --> 00:14:34,730
world.
As you know.

280
00:14:34,731 --> 00:14:35,564
The Chinese government doesn't undoes 
things as it pleases and they can even 

281
00:14:38,481 --> 00:14:41,120
determine who survives in a market and 
do doesn't.

282
00:14:41,270 --> 00:14:42,103
That means that a botched delivery to a 
communist party leader could become 

283
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,910
Alibaba's worst nightmare.

284
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:52,070
In any

285
00:14:52,070 --> 00:14:52,903
case,
it's clear that Alibaba is the best 

286
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:54,794
example of the changes that are weld is 
experiencing how Asia is gaining power 

287
00:14:59,061 --> 00:15:03,600
and how it's beginning to acquire its 
own large multinationals ends.

288
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,503
It's something we're going to have to 
get used to because I really hope you
