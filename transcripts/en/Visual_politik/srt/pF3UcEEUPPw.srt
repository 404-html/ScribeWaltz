1
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:10,290
We already told you here on visual 
politic,

2
00:00:10,291 --> 00:00:12,780
even though it is unusual to hear about 
this,

3
00:00:12,781 --> 00:00:13,614
the truth is that in recent years,
some things have begun to change in 

4
00:00:16,921 --> 00:00:21,921
Africa.
The year 2000,

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,520
half of the fastest growing economies on
the planet have actually been located on

6
00:00:30,521 --> 00:00:31,354
this continent according to the 
international monetary funds forecasts 

7
00:00:37,351 --> 00:00:39,530
in 2018.
Six.

8
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:42,110
Yeah,
six of the 10 economies with the highest

9
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:45,110
growth rates will be African countries 
like Tanzania,

10
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:48,200
Ethiopia in the Ivory Coast or at the 
head of the race.

11
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:53,230
In terms of global growth.
Now,

12
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:57,670
Africa is a huge continent.
It's made up of 54 individual countries,

13
00:00:57,671 --> 00:01:00,180
so we can find all sorts of situations 
here.

14
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:04,760
Countries that grow a lot and countries 
that grow well less,

15
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:05,653
but there's a case that stands out above
all of them and not precisely because 

16
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:14,450
things are going well.
Yes,

17
00:01:14,451 --> 00:01:15,284
of course.
I'm talking about South Africa or a 

18
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:17,564
country.
That was the great African hope for a 

19
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:21,200
really long time.
Well,

20
00:01:21,230 --> 00:01:25,310
Dvu at the truth is that Nelson 
Mandela's dream of a free and prosperous

21
00:01:25,311 --> 00:01:27,350
South Africa.
It's become something of a nightmare.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:29,330
In recent years,
things have gone really wrong,

23
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:30,380
growth,
Spanish,

24
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:33,830
racial problems of returns in corruption
has spread throughout the country.

25
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:44,870
Congress is actually talking about 
expropriating,

26
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:47,600
the glands of white people without any 
compensation.

27
00:01:47,660 --> 00:01:48,493
However,
in February the government changed and 

28
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:52,670
one of the richest men in Africa became 
the new presidents.

29
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,533
So could South Africa get back on the 
right path or are we facing another 

30
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:59,480
great African disappointments?
In this video,

31
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:00,314
we also want to look at what caused 
those good years to ends and if the 

32
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:05,300
white population in the country faces 
any risk,

33
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,360
so let's get on with it.
South African disappointment.

34
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,870
South Africa is a huge country.
It's about the size of France,

35
00:02:19,871 --> 00:02:20,800
Germany,
Italy,

36
00:02:20,801 --> 00:02:23,530
the Netherlands,
and Belgium all combined together and it

37
00:02:23,531 --> 00:02:26,440
represents about a quarter of all of 
Subsaharan.

38
00:02:26,441 --> 00:02:27,274
Africa is GDP well after the ends of a 
pore size and after the democratic 

39
00:02:36,181 --> 00:02:37,014
transition that began in 1994.
South Africa experienced a particular 

40
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,330
golden age between 1998 and 2008.
The economy grew steadily.

41
00:02:45,331 --> 00:02:46,164
This allowed the black middle class to 
double and essential services such as 

42
00:02:49,081 --> 00:02:50,670
running water reached to most of the

43
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,673
relations

44
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:56,710
with a big economy,
a vibrant democracy,

45
00:02:56,711 --> 00:02:57,544
a free press,
and lots of civic organizations seems 

46
00:02:59,861 --> 00:03:04,180
ready for South Africa to make the leap 
that would allow its people and not just

47
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,043
white people to live the comfortable 
lives of citizens of a developed 

48
00:03:07,931 --> 00:03:08,920
country.
In other words,

49
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:09,783
South Africa was expected to become a 
role model for the entire African 

50
00:03:12,761 --> 00:03:13,594
continent.
My hold on a moment here because things 

51
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,010
don't always turn out quite as expected 
and in 2009,

52
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,130
this entire process ended.
Since then,

53
00:03:24,131 --> 00:03:29,131
things have just gone from bad to worse.
Economy isn't growing.

54
00:03:33,631 --> 00:03:36,240
Unemployment has risen to almost 40 
percent.

55
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,103
Poverty has picked up again and public 
accounts are absolutely shattered and 

56
00:03:40,501 --> 00:03:41,334
that's not all the latest government 
measures that the government is 

57
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:45,720
announced and the current social 
tensions have even caused.

58
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,250
Announcements like this

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,453
last March,
2018 Australian Minister of internal 

60
00:03:51,951 --> 00:03:54,320
affairs,
Peter Dutton publicly announced that his

61
00:03:54,321 --> 00:03:58,460
country would consider granting a 
special emergency visa and refuge to the

62
00:03:58,461 --> 00:04:02,150
South African white population that felt
unsafe in their own country.

63
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:04,590
Now,
hold on just a moment here because we're

64
00:04:04,591 --> 00:04:05,424
talking about an Australian minister 
here talking about sheltering white 

65
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,910
South Africans.
I mean all things really that bad.

66
00:04:11,911 --> 00:04:14,700
Wasn't this the country of harmony and 
reconciliation?

67
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:16,680
Well,
you heard what that minister had to say,

68
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:18,780
but at this point in the question really
still remains.

69
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:20,550
What the hell went wrong?
Well,

70
00:04:20,551 --> 00:04:23,730
we already have our culprits.
We talked about him before.

71
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:24,564
By the way,
in a video that I will link to in the 

72
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:27,840
description.
Do you know who he is?

73
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,670
Well,
listen.

74
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,670
Okay.
Jacob Zuma,

75
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,740
ninth of May,
2009,

76
00:04:40,741 --> 00:04:43,200
Jacob Zuma became the president of South
Africa.

77
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:46,740
Just launched his controversial record,
which included accusations of rape,

78
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,840
corruption,
and even organized crime.

79
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:49,743
Zuma managed to reach power thanks to 
the support of the popular classes who 

80
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:56,040
felt that he was one of their own.
After all,

81
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:56,874
we're talking about one of the most 
prominent leaders of the anti apartheid 

82
00:04:59,221 --> 00:05:03,000
movement and leader for 10 years was in 
prison with Nelson Mandela himself,

83
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,280
the father of the current South African 
nation,

84
00:05:06,630 --> 00:05:09,540
and this well.
It gave him a great deal of credibility.

85
00:05:09,700 --> 00:05:11,040
Worldview.
Jacob Zuma,

86
00:05:11,041 --> 00:05:15,120
who opened the practices polygamy and is
estimated to have at least 20 children,

87
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:19,200
was forced to resign and leave through 
the back door on February the 14th,

88
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:19,900
2018.

89
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:20,733
See,

90
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:22,460
I mean,
check this out.

91
00:05:22,461 --> 00:05:23,294
He was repudiated by his own party,
the powerful African National Congress 

92
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:30,410
cornered by the opposition who 
threatened him with a motion of censure.

93
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:31,333
He simply had no other alternative.
You had to leave one way or another for 

94
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:36,680
the almost nine years that Zuma was 
empower.

95
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,570
Life in South Africa was a nightmare.

96
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:43,560
You see zoom that came to power with the
promise of a more prosperous country and

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:46,060
more opportunities for the poorest,
but instead it's.

98
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,480
Well,
what do you think he did?

99
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,383
Yup.
Nothing less than turning these South 

100
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,603
African governments into a kind of mine,
a business that's simply served him and 

101
00:05:54,031 --> 00:05:55,290
is in a circle.
By the way,

102
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:58,400
do you know what the first thing he did 
after named president was?

103
00:05:58,430 --> 00:05:59,263
Well,
he spent $23,000,000 from the state 

104
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:02,564
budget to improve his private residence.
That's what we mean pulled here or an 

105
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:10,190
empathy that he even had a cow barn and 
a chicken coop built,

106
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:15,210
but of course that's not all.
On March,

107
00:06:15,211 --> 00:06:16,044
the 16th national prosecutors announced 
that they would present challenges 

108
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:19,223
against Jacob Zuma for a multimillion 
dollar purchase agreements of weapons 

109
00:06:21,751 --> 00:06:22,501
ships,
submarines,

110
00:06:22,501 --> 00:06:23,334
and fighter jets with European companies
that South Africa signs in the 19 

111
00:06:25,981 --> 00:06:27,000
nineties.
For this time,

112
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:29,410
Zuma was Nelson Mandela's deputy 
presidents.

113
00:06:32,670 --> 00:06:33,503
This weapons purchase cost over 
$3,000,000,000 and the stated goal was 

114
00:06:37,081 --> 00:06:40,740
improving national security.
The real goal though was enriching.

115
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:41,574
Guys like Jacob Zuma,
the arms deal was the most graphic loss 

116
00:06:46,141 --> 00:06:46,974
of innocence of post apartheid South 
Africa and it Persado the corruption 

117
00:06:49,891 --> 00:06:51,810
we're seeing today.
David Lewis,

118
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:52,733
executive director of corruption.
Watch a nonprofit organization based in 

119
00:06:55,891 --> 00:06:58,590
your hand is Berg,
and this is just one case.

120
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:02,460
Dozens and dozens of more cases are 
lined up for Zima,

121
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,170
so in short,
yes,

122
00:07:04,171 --> 00:07:06,420
he was a really,
really greedy dude.

123
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,313
In total is estimated that Jacob Zuma is
corruption and the corruption of his 

124
00:07:09,571 --> 00:07:10,404
inner circle have cost the public 
coffers more than 4 million American 

125
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:16,980
dollars,
or if you think that is the West thing,

126
00:07:16,981 --> 00:07:19,140
well you all very,
very wrong.

127
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,003
The worst part is that he got the cancer
that is corruption to spread massively 

128
00:07:23,131 --> 00:07:24,480
through the country.
Listen up here,

129
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,253
cancer

130
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:39,080
thing was always clear that Jacob Zuma,
and he even said it openly,

131
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:41,360
his party,
the national African Congress,

132
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,194
was more important than the very South 
African nation that had been elected to 

133
00:07:45,441 --> 00:07:49,460
serve and what better way to put the 
party in the forefront then by enriching

134
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,353
it's leaders with public resources and 
that's precisely what he did have since 

135
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:58,010
Zuma came to power.
Corruption has multiplied.

136
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:58,933
State services are a mess,
and some math teachers don't even know 

137
00:08:01,191 --> 00:08:02,930
what a square root is.
Indeed,

138
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:03,764
the reason they got the job with simply 
because they were formerly affiliated 

139
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:10,190
with the president's party,
virtually no institution in South Africa

140
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,053
has been spared from the corruption,
so you see one way to measure the 

141
00:08:15,231 --> 00:08:16,064
intensity of corruption in South Africa 
is to look at the quality of housing 

142
00:08:18,741 --> 00:08:20,840
that the government builds for its 
poorest people.

143
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:23,900
If the budget is already low,
when we discount what politicians take,

144
00:08:23,901 --> 00:08:26,810
not only in terms of money,
also in construction materials,

145
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:29,600
in the end,
houses end up so poorly constructed that

146
00:08:29,601 --> 00:08:30,434
some have even collapse.
Another very common form of corruption 

147
00:08:34,871 --> 00:08:38,110
is seizing funds that were aimed at the 
developments of the poorest areas.

148
00:08:38,170 --> 00:08:39,003
For an example,
we can look at dairy farms that are 

149
00:08:40,241 --> 00:08:41,070
backed by the government.

150
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,010
That's okay.

151
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:47,660
The best case is that of a farm promoted
directly by Moza benzies Wayne,

152
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:50,000
who of course became zoom as minister of
mining.

153
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:50,863
So I.
One day this gentleman came to a poor 

154
00:08:51,801 --> 00:08:52,634
community and promise to build a dairy 
farm that was financed by the 

155
00:08:54,771 --> 00:08:55,604
government.
Supposedly the farm would be controlled 

156
00:08:56,911 --> 00:08:57,744
by the workers who'd joined the project 
and who were even promised a trip to 

157
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
India to learn how to manage the farm.
So as you can probably see from this 

158
00:09:03,901 --> 00:09:06,150
already,
it's not exactly looking great.

159
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,373
He said he wanted to change our lives.
He said this thing was coming from the 

160
00:09:11,561 --> 00:09:14,170
government free of charge.
He said,

161
00:09:14,171 --> 00:09:16,960
we couldn't say don't like this thing.
He said,

162
00:09:16,990 --> 00:09:21,250
we must take it a frame can Yamini of 
black South African farmer.

163
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:24,280
In the end the government spends more 
than $20,000,000,

164
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:26,010
but the only ones who went on a trip 
with,

165
00:09:26,011 --> 00:09:26,844
uh,
members of this politicians church 

166
00:09:28,091 --> 00:09:30,580
choir,
and of course he kept any leftover money

167
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:31,493
as for the farm.
What it is unclear if any cow milks 

168
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:38,970
thanks to this project,
and this again is just one example.

169
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,153
Out of hundreds in recent years,
billions of dollars aimed at 

170
00:09:44,891 --> 00:09:49,270
developments have been diverted,
simply lost by the leaders of the ruling

171
00:09:49,271 --> 00:09:51,130
party.
And of course,

172
00:09:51,131 --> 00:09:53,410
as you can imagine,
all of this has caused a huge amounts of

173
00:09:53,411 --> 00:09:57,100
economic damage investing in a country 
where any politician can stick his hands

174
00:09:57,101 --> 00:10:00,100
in the coffers or where public accounts 
are highly unreliable,

175
00:10:00,130 --> 00:10:00,963
does not sound enticing.
But now off Jacob Zoom is forced 

176
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:05,884
resignation.
His party was getting nervous about the 

177
00:10:07,661 --> 00:10:10,540
upcoming elections and the big question 
now becomes,

178
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:13,000
will the new government change things

179
00:10:19,260 --> 00:10:20,093
change

180
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,450
maybe the 15th,
2018.

181
00:10:24,451 --> 00:10:26,970
After Jacob Zoom his resignation,
several roundup posts,

182
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:30,700
another historic leader of the anti 
apartheid movement was named president.

183
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:33,340
We all talking about just any guy though
Mr Rammer poster,

184
00:10:33,390 --> 00:10:34,223
left politics at the end of the nineties
and leaped into the business wells as 

185
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,231
you know,
what?

186
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,064
Thanks to his influence and his good 
relations with governments around the 

187
00:10:40,381 --> 00:10:43,440
posts that became one of the wealthiest 
men in sub Saharan Africa.

188
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,333
His car,
unfortunately is estimated to be close 

189
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:48,210
to half a billion dollars.
Well,

190
00:10:48,211 --> 00:10:49,044
the fact is that this new president has 
promised in new dawn and he has said 

191
00:10:51,361 --> 00:10:54,240
that his policy will prioritize 
balancing public accounts,

192
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:58,260
attracting investments,
fighting corruption is mostly with South

193
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,940
Africa,
is open for business.

194
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:03,270
Of course,
these are already facing some problems.

195
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,760
In March,
the National Assembly approved the start

196
00:11:05,761 --> 00:11:06,594
of the process to change the 
constitution in such a way that the 

197
00:11:08,341 --> 00:11:11,310
governments can express,
create the lands of the white population

198
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,430
without any compensation,
and if they do carry this out,

199
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:17,340
investments are certainly not going to 
come to the country.

200
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:19,410
In fact,
they're going to flee in the end.

201
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:23,580
Only time is going to tell if this new 
government will succeed in getting South

202
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:24,413
Africans and joined the lions that are 
awakening for if the country will 

203
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:29,970
continue on its path towards the abyss.
But now it's your turn.

204
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:30,804
Do you think your country's own 
government is fighting enough against 

205
00:11:33,241 --> 00:11:33,890
corruption?
Well,
