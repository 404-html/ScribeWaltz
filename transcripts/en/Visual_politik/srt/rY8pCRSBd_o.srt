1
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:09,720
Francis,
probably the only country that makes the

2
00:00:09,721 --> 00:00:10,554
Americans look humble.
The Ego of the French is so colossal 

3
00:00:13,591 --> 00:00:16,530
that it doesn't even fit within its own 
country's borders,

4
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:21,531
which explains why the French spends the
19th century colonizing other countries.

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,260
Almost half of Africa was a French 
colony as I bet you could probably guess

6
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:26,094
now.
The most widely spoken language in 

7
00:00:27,301 --> 00:00:28,650
Subsaharan Africa.
Yep.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,740
That would be French,
but not only that,

9
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,060
you will probably heard that Latin 
America is the United States,

10
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:39,860
his back yard rice.
Well,

11
00:00:39,861 --> 00:00:43,520
we could say the Africa is kind of like 
the backyard of the French.

12
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:44,940
For example,
in 2011,

13
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:47,700
France led every military operation 
against Gaddafi.

14
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:53,953
Francois Salons,
government sent troops to defend the 

15
00:00:56,011 --> 00:00:57,990
president of the Central African 
Republic.

16
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,824
While at the same time,
French soldiers were also fighting 

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:03,510
Islamic terrorists in Mali.
Basically,

18
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:07,770
the French army has been present in 
virtually every African armed conflict

19
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:08,813
prompts even actually controls the 
currency that many African countries 

20
00:01:10,981 --> 00:01:12,270
use.
In other words,

21
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:16,860
even though African countries gained 
independence from from decades ago,

22
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,550
it still maintains a strong influence on
their governments.

23
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,430
You can call it soft power,
you can call it diplomacy.

24
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:25,860
Oh,
you could simply call it colonialism.

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:28,980
Two point nine,
and I probably know what many of you are

26
00:01:28,981 --> 00:01:32,460
thinking right now.
France has got to be getting rich off.

27
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:33,630
It's two point.
Oh,

28
00:01:33,631 --> 00:01:35,610
African colonies,
right?

29
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:38,640
Well actually nothing could be further 
from the truth.

30
00:01:38,710 --> 00:01:39,543
Yeah.

31
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:43,910
The last 10 years,
for instance,

32
00:01:43,911 --> 00:01:47,510
trade with Africa has dropped from 10 to
four point seven percent

33
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:48,723
had that right.
Even though from dominates African 

34
00:01:50,741 --> 00:01:51,574
politics,
its economy is an entirely different 

35
00:01:54,491 --> 00:01:55,540
story.
In fact,

36
00:01:55,570 --> 00:01:56,403
often centuries of colonialism and 
neocolonialism African countries have 

37
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:01,443
barely evolved.
Hardly any new companies have emerged 

38
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:08,440
due to French investments and meanwhile 
francis spending billions of euros every

39
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,273
year to maintain its influence over the 
continent even though ultimately it 

40
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:15,550
barely gets any benefit at all.
Bus.

41
00:02:15,551 --> 00:02:16,384
I,
as you can guess who's reaping all of 

42
00:02:17,711 --> 00:02:20,740
the benefits from this collaboration 
with Africa?

43
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,030
Yep,
of course.

44
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,010
We will be talking about China.

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:31,430
Companies and Africa need each other 
like never before.

46
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,463
For the last 10 years,
Chinese investment has changed the 

47
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:39,190
skyline of almost all African cities.
Some countries like Ethiopia,

48
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:43,200
at becoming industrial powers,
especially in the textile sac,

49
00:02:43,201 --> 00:02:44,034
sac,
Chinese companies aren't only taking 

50
00:02:45,341 --> 00:02:46,174
advantage of the cheap labor,
they've also found a new market to sell 

51
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:49,954
that product to.
Chinese mobiles are sweeping across 

52
00:02:52,331 --> 00:02:55,840
Africa and is more and more people are 
learning Chinese.

53
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:58,570
In other words,
while France sends soldiers,

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,673
China sends businessmen and it looks 
like it's actually working out pretty 

55
00:03:02,411 --> 00:03:04,960
well for them.
So the question remains,

56
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:09,340
why is France failed to capitalize on 
its influence in Africa and what can the

57
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:13,870
new French President Emmanuel macron do 
to improve the situation today?

58
00:03:13,871 --> 00:03:15,460
Well,
we're going to answer this question,

59
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,680
but before we do,
let's take a look at the history.

60
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:23,090
Disadvantages of paternalism.

61
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:24,063
Those of you who've been following 
visual politic for awhile know that 

62
00:03:26,231 --> 00:03:29,020
after World War Two,
every African country became independent

63
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:34,170
from its colonizers.
Make no mistake,

64
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:41,010
not every colonizer behave the same way.
For example,

65
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,970
Spain had two colonies in Africa,
Sahara and Equatorial Guinea.

66
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,420
So when these new countries decided to 
become independent,

67
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,130
the Spanish government's reaction was 
pretty much weight.

68
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,023
We have colonies in Africa and then they
pretty much just let them go because 

69
00:03:54,091 --> 00:03:56,040
they had enough to worry about back 
home.

70
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:56,913
Something similar happens with they 
invaded Ethiopia during miscellaneous 

71
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,410
time and weren't in a position to resist
any decolonization.

72
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:10,160
However,
from sue was very different,

73
00:04:10,161 --> 00:04:12,740
so at that time the French president was
this guy,

74
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,633
Charles,
to goal to goal was how can we define 

75
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:17,720
it?
He was kind of Donald Trump,

76
00:04:17,721 --> 00:04:20,000
but a little bit more politically smart.

77
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,830
CanNot Be France without its greatness.
Charleston

78
00:04:26,930 --> 00:04:27,763
cool.

79
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,853
Now on the one hand,
Charles de Gaulle had pretty much no 

80
00:04:31,511 --> 00:04:35,380
choice but to allow its African colonies
to become independence.

81
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,393
Maintaining colonies is really expensive
and from Santa focus on rebuilding 

82
00:04:39,731 --> 00:04:41,230
itself,
but as you can imagine,

83
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:44,440
a government with so much ego wasn't 
going to give up.

84
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:48,730
It's old possessions from skeptics.
Ami in all of its former colonies.

85
00:04:48,731 --> 00:04:53,731
Sands from the Elysee Palace decided to 
support everyone of the political elites

86
00:04:54,731 --> 00:04:57,640
that had begun governing these new 
African countries.

87
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,290
For example,
in 1964,

88
00:05:04,291 --> 00:05:06,870
the French army,
it's supported acu in Gabon.

89
00:05:06,930 --> 00:05:09,300
Since then,
the country was governed by Oma bongos.

90
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,134
Dictatorship.
For more than 40 years and you supplied 

91
00:05:12,841 --> 00:05:13,674
all the weapons,
well of course it would be France and 

92
00:05:15,601 --> 00:05:16,434
resigned and gambling and follows French
foreign policy to the and is its main 

93
00:05:20,341 --> 00:05:22,080
uranium supplier.
As you probably know,

94
00:05:22,081 --> 00:05:22,914
France is one of the countries with the 
most nuclear power plants in the whole 

95
00:05:25,441 --> 00:05:26,430
world.
Well,

96
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,293
the Uranian they use it comes almost 
entirely from gambling and of course 

97
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:33,270
they get it at a favorable price.

98
00:05:35,450 --> 00:05:38,090
Gabon was out.
France is like a car without a driver.

99
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,540
France without Gabon is like a car with 
no fuel,

100
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,930
well more Bunco,
president of Gabon for 42 years

101
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:45,893
and the same goes for other countries 
such as the Ivory Coast who's president 

102
00:05:48,721 --> 00:05:49,554
was also placed by France in 2011.
The previous presidents left the palace 

103
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:54,174
under cannon shots and guests.
He was pulling the trigger of those 

104
00:05:56,611 --> 00:05:57,500
canons.
Well,

105
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:58,393
yes,
it would be French soldiers and 

106
00:05:59,391 --> 00:06:00,224
resigned.
The Ivory Coast is Francis made coffee 

107
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,163
and cocoa supplier.
French influence in the region is so 

108
00:06:05,211 --> 00:06:06,044
complete.
There's even the currency they use is 

109
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:08,810
controlled by froms,

110
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:09,713
so called CFA franc is the currency 
being used in 15 of west African 

111
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:16,800
countries such as Mali,
Burkina Faso and Ivory Coast,

112
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,780
and it turns out that the central bank 
that issues this currency is required to

113
00:06:24,781 --> 00:06:28,320
keep at least half of its foreign 
currency reserves in the French treasury

114
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,533
and since its creation,
the CFA franc has been linked to the 

115
00:06:31,591 --> 00:06:32,424
French currency.
He used to be the French franc and now 

116
00:06:34,051 --> 00:06:34,884
it's the euro.
This means that when the euro rises or 

117
00:06:36,451 --> 00:06:38,640
falls,
the CFA franc follow.

118
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:43,173
Wait a moment because there's some fine 
print here and now find brands is the 

119
00:06:45,931 --> 00:06:47,580
productive economy.
In other words,

120
00:06:47,581 --> 00:06:48,414
France has been running,
it's former colonies policies for 

121
00:06:50,461 --> 00:06:51,294
decades,
but these countries have remained just 

122
00:06:53,241 --> 00:06:56,820
as poor as when they were independence 
with the exception of the Ivory Coast.

123
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:57,683
The French influenced countries in 
Africa tend to have underdeveloped 

124
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:03,120
agricultural and virtually stagnant 
economies.

125
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,073
No French company has bothered to open 
factories in Africa and the money that 

126
00:07:06,991 --> 00:07:07,824
came from the Elisa was invested in 
weapons or extracting natural resources 

127
00:07:11,790 --> 00:07:14,580
after all who wants to do business in 
Africa?

128
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:15,623
Well,
you probably already know the answer to 

129
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,810
that.
China,

130
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,750
Africa,
we've told you a thousand times.

131
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,840
Aaron Fisher,
politic.

132
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,733
China is Africa's main trading.
These China grew economically like 

133
00:07:31,161 --> 00:07:35,120
there's no tomorrow and when one starts 
grabbing one needs resources.

134
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:36,013
So far,
nothing new because unlike France or 

135
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:38,323
many other Western power,
China realize that Africa was more than 

136
00:07:41,151 --> 00:07:43,220
mines and oil fields.

137
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,550
I believe Africa is going to become the 
next manufacturer.

138
00:07:47,551 --> 00:07:48,384
Flow,
photo work and poverty will not be a 

139
00:07:51,181 --> 00:07:55,980
destiny and millions of people you 
Africa will escape poverty.

140
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,120
Thank you all.

141
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:03,710
The woman you just heard is Helen.
Hi.

142
00:08:03,711 --> 00:08:04,544
And she's a Chinese businesswoman.
That company is Gian and it makes shoes 

143
00:08:08,211 --> 00:08:11,180
for big brands.
If you have gas or Calvin Klein shoes,

144
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:12,014
it's very likely that they were made by 
this company and I bet you can't guess 

145
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:16,520
where it's biggest factor is.
Well,

146
00:08:16,521 --> 00:08:19,340
it's actually located not in China,
but in Addis Ababa.

147
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,540
Ethiopia is capital.

148
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,240
Let me

149
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,740
think about it.
In the nineties,

150
00:08:26,741 --> 00:08:27,574
China was the Mecca of cheap labor,
every large American or European 

151
00:08:30,761 --> 00:08:31,594
company,
which that of its factories in cities 

152
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:34,950
such as Shenzhen or Guangzhou,
so,

153
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:37,660
but as the country grew salaries group 
two,

154
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,700
and it's by the year 2011,
Helen,

155
00:08:39,701 --> 00:08:41,980
hi.
Realized that if she wanted to cut costs

156
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:42,814
in terms of salaries,
she needed to find another country and 

157
00:08:45,401 --> 00:08:48,060
that country was Ethiopia once more.
Helen,

158
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,510
hi.
Wasn't traveling alone.

159
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,463
She had the Chinese government support 
which address the Ethiopian political 

160
00:08:53,411 --> 00:08:55,120
elites and told them,
look guys,

161
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,700
if you just let us do things our way,
we can cover the country with factories,

162
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:01,380
with money,
jobs,

163
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:04,440
and as we often say,
visual politic as it will said.

164
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:05,370
So it was done.

165
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:11,703
Industrial Park is already operational 
and Ethiopia wants it to become a 

166
00:09:14,851 --> 00:09:15,684
manufacturing hub,
but we're not just talking about 

167
00:09:17,521 --> 00:09:18,354
Ethiopia here.
There are Chinese factories in many 

168
00:09:20,251 --> 00:09:21,084
other countries twice.
It is a company that manufactures 

169
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:27,300
ceramic tiles and it's main plant is on 
the outskirts of Nairobi in Kenya,

170
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:31,510
and we can also find new industrial 
parks and other countries like Ghana.

171
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:34,620
Even though Chinese companies are 
supported by the governments,

172
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:35,573
we're mostly talking about private 
investments here and I probably can 

173
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,324
guess what you're thinking right now 
that these companies are making cheap 

174
00:09:41,821 --> 00:09:44,400
things so they can sell them.
So rich countries,

175
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:46,950
Rice.
Well actually not really.

176
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:50,220
For example,
Star Times is a company in Tanzania made

177
00:09:50,221 --> 00:09:51,054
with Chinese capital and it provides 
cable television since they reached the 

178
00:09:53,401 --> 00:09:55,590
market.
Cable TV prices have dropped by 95.

179
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,340
Thanks.

180
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,620
That more than $10 million Africans can 
enjoy a service.

181
00:10:01,621 --> 00:10:04,980
That was a luxury and the same is going 
on with telecom.

182
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:08,370
Companies like Huawei have flooded the 
market with cheap mobile phones.

183
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,263
In fact,
nowadays the same amount of Kenyans use 

184
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,330
mobile phones as Europeans and of course
to connect all these industrial centers,

185
00:10:15,331 --> 00:10:18,450
the Chinese government has spared no 
expense.

186
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:19,373
Do you?
To the new Silk Road we talked about 

187
00:10:20,461 --> 00:10:22,260
previously,
the so called one belt,

188
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:24,510
one road project that Xi Jinping 
launched.

189
00:10:24,570 --> 00:10:25,403
Well,
the same thing is happening in Africa 

190
00:10:26,701 --> 00:10:27,534
and we're talking about thousands of 
kilometers of railroads and roads that 

191
00:10:31,051 --> 00:10:34,590
have changed the landscape of several 
areas of the continent.

192
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,280
In other words,
unlike France,

193
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:46,840
China hasn't tried to colonize Africa,
but instead has turns them into business

194
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:47,693
partners and thanks to that they have 
managed and more money and more 

195
00:10:50,831 --> 00:10:51,664
influence.
Fucious institutes are raising 

196
00:10:56,691 --> 00:10:57,524
generations of pro Chinese mandarin 
speakers throughout Africa and now 

197
00:11:01,101 --> 00:11:02,360
you're wondering,
well,

198
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,253
what conference do about this?
Are they just going to sit by while 

199
00:11:05,511 --> 00:11:07,640
China and gulfs the market?
Well,

200
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:08,563
we'll see common interests.
It probably won't surprise you to learn 

201
00:11:13,751 --> 00:11:14,584
that a large number of African countries
aren't exactly legal safety paradises 

202
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,693
that have a lot of respect for the law.
We're often talking about dictatorships 

203
00:11:21,761 --> 00:11:22,780
out.
Others,

204
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:23,643
I'll simply failed states that can 
barely contain the fights of various 

205
00:11:26,651 --> 00:11:27,484
tribes.
That means setting up a factory in a 

206
00:11:29,681 --> 00:11:32,560
country like Gavin is much more 
complicated than setting one up.

207
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:34,600
For example,
in a place like the United States,

208
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:39,130
it isn't

209
00:11:39,130 --> 00:11:43,150
enough to buy land and get a permit.
You need to have government contracts.

210
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:47,410
That means in these cases,
diplomacy plays a fundamental role.

211
00:11:47,470 --> 00:11:50,680
Or in the how I told you that froms 
controls its former colonies governments

212
00:11:50,681 --> 00:11:51,970
with an iron fist.
Well,

213
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:53,800
you can imagine the rest of the story.

214
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:54,663
Yeah.

215
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:58,413
French companies must go on the 
offensive and fight to the growing 

216
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,534
influence of rival China for a stake in 
Africa's increasingly competitive 

217
00:12:04,931 --> 00:12:06,190
markets.
For instance,

218
00:12:06,191 --> 00:12:08,710
minister pro Muscovy chief said on 
Saturday,

219
00:12:08,990 --> 00:12:09,823
as you can imagine,
if France doesn't want China to invest 

220
00:12:11,421 --> 00:12:12,254
in its former colonies,
it has enough tools to prevent it and 

221
00:12:14,721 --> 00:12:17,900
that's why Chinese money has banny 
reached these countries.

222
00:12:18,050 --> 00:12:18,883
Of course Beijing has paid for some 
projects in countries like the Ivory 

223
00:12:21,530 --> 00:12:22,363
Coast and Ghana,
and there's little in comparison to 

224
00:12:24,471 --> 00:12:26,470
Ethiopia or Kenya.
However,

225
00:12:26,570 --> 00:12:29,570
things could start to change.
The new French President Emmanuel Macron

226
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:30,583
has promised to turn the African 
situation around and it looks like it's 

227
00:12:33,741 --> 00:12:34,574
already started.
Revives Francis Partnership with China 

228
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,150
in Africa.
As mccrone said at the press conference,

229
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:45,510
China has the money and we have the 
knowledge of the region.

230
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:46,463
In other words,
France would be willing to allow the 

231
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:48,984
African politicians they control except 
Chinese investments in return that 

232
00:12:52,801 --> 00:12:54,810
require a piece of the pie.
Of course,

233
00:12:54,811 --> 00:12:55,644
this news is from January 2018,
so there's still a lot to do before we 

234
00:12:59,221 --> 00:13:01,140
can see how this agreement turns out.

235
00:13:06,830 --> 00:13:07,663
So now the question becomes,
do you think France will change its 

236
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,394
policy,
consenting Africa and started treating 

237
00:13:12,111 --> 00:13:12,944
its former colonies?
Is trading partners or will they just 

238
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,510
continue to exchange nice sweats?
