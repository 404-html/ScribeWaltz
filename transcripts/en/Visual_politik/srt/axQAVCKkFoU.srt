1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
A political threat looms over much of 
the world develops countries as well as 

2
00:00:08,531 --> 00:00:11,080
many emerging countries such as in 
China's case,

3
00:00:11,140 --> 00:00:11,973
I beginning to see the effects that 
demographic aging and it's can any 

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:19,231
public services unsustainability can 
cause with increasing concern along with

5
00:00:20,381 --> 00:00:21,214
pensions.
Health is another of the fields that 

6
00:00:22,181 --> 00:00:24,880
generate the most uncertainties and 
fears.

7
00:00:26,980 --> 00:00:27,813
Increasingly aging population and the 
emergence of new and expensive medical 

8
00:00:30,671 --> 00:00:33,520
technologies have raised some very 
important questions.

9
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:35,593
What would we be able to pay for a 
quality healthcare system or when we'd 

10
00:00:38,581 --> 00:00:39,414
be condemned to a precarious health 
situation that affects our life 

11
00:00:41,981 --> 00:00:42,814
prospects?
Is there a successful model that can 

12
00:00:44,801 --> 00:00:46,810
lead the way other alternatives?
Well,

13
00:00:46,811 --> 00:00:47,644
in this video we're going to look at a 
system that we may more or less like 

14
00:00:50,561 --> 00:00:51,394
that which we should definitely know 
about us can take into account 

15
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,170
throughout this debate.
It's not sort of look at it,

16
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:05,943
check out the following graph.
It shows the country leaving the third 

17
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,920
world's behind and becoming one of the 
richest areas on the planet.

18
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,280
Okay?

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:23,113
35 years ago,
Singapore in Spain at the same per 

20
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:26,540
capita income today.
However,

21
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:27,374
the format more than doubles the Spanish
per capita income in 2015 in Singapore 

22
00:01:32,081 --> 00:01:32,914
is per capita income was $86,100 per 
year and spends was just $34,750 but 

23
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:44,060
even if we look at countries like 
Finland,

24
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,140
Denmark,
Sweden,

25
00:01:45,141 --> 00:01:47,330
Germany,
or the United States as examples,

26
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,290
we'd be able to see that Singapore is 
much richer than any of them.

27
00:01:52,730 --> 00:01:54,710
However,
it's often said that Singapore's example

28
00:01:54,711 --> 00:01:55,544
isn't good enough because their wealth 
essentially comes from a financial 

29
00:01:58,041 --> 00:02:01,370
sector that is much larger than any of 
the aforementioned mentions countries,

30
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,293
and that's true,
but it's not the only key to this small 

31
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:06,104
states success.
The weight of Singapore's financial 

32
00:02:08,031 --> 00:02:12,230
sector isn't big enough to explain these
differences in par capita income.

33
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:13,153
In fact,
if we were to eliminate the effects of 

34
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:17,330
these countries,
different financial sector sizes,

35
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,193
Singapore would still be much richer 
than the others because it's actually 

36
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:24,193
both trade and manufacturing are more 
important in Singapore than the 

37
00:02:27,651 --> 00:02:28,484
financial sector.
We're talking about one of the largest 

38
00:02:30,441 --> 00:02:33,410
merchandise exporting countries in the 
entire world.

39
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,273
For example,
the proportion of electronic material 

40
00:02:36,121 --> 00:02:40,520
that this country exports in relation to
its GDP is larger than the proportion of

41
00:02:40,521 --> 00:02:42,770
anything exported by countries like 
Spain,

42
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:43,880
Sweden,
Denmark,

43
00:02:43,881 --> 00:02:48,440
or even Germany.
So the question now becomes,

44
00:02:48,441 --> 00:02:51,830
how did Singapore achieved such a high 
level of prosperity?

45
00:02:55,670 --> 00:02:57,260
Well,
if we wanted to simplify it,

46
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,780
we could say that Singapore is the 
freest economy in the wells according to

47
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:02,614
the index of economic freedom published 
annually by the Heritage Foundation and 

48
00:03:05,671 --> 00:03:07,450
the Wall Street Journal.
It's public spending,

49
00:03:07,451 --> 00:03:08,284
for example,
is half of the u acids and a third of 

50
00:03:10,781 --> 00:03:11,614
Sweden's listen to the words of the 
historic president's of Singapore Lee 

51
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:16,293
Kuan Yew,
which successfully reflect to the real 

52
00:03:17,621 --> 00:03:20,380
foundations of this country's economic 
success.

53
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,483
When most of the third world was deeply 
suspicious of exploitation by Western 

54
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,430
multinational corporations,
Singapore invited them in,

55
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,413
they helped us grow,
brought in technology and knowhow and 

56
00:03:32,641 --> 00:03:33,474
raised productivity levels faster than 
any alternative strategy could of Lee 

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,210
Kuan Yew.
Think about what success is,

58
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:41,310
therefore,
not due to the financial industry,

59
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:45,780
but due to the same reasons that have 
led to the growth of other economies.

60
00:03:45,810 --> 00:03:47,760
Legal security,
low taxes,

61
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:50,270
monetary stability and moderate 
regulations.

62
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,063
Yes

63
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,580
to the free market has made this country
become in many areas.

64
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,443
An example,
and we're not only talking strictly 

65
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:06,464
about economics here,
but also certain social issues such as 

66
00:04:08,781 --> 00:04:10,370
health.
When you have that ride,

67
00:04:10,371 --> 00:04:13,340
Singapore is also a role model in terms 
of health policy.

68
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:14,963
Okay,

69
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,080
awesome.
Will Challenge.

70
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,033
Sure.

71
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,110
Let's take a look for example,
at Spain's case,

72
00:04:25,111 --> 00:04:25,944
a country whose health system is 
considered one of the most efficient on 

73
00:04:28,081 --> 00:04:28,741
the planet.
Well,

74
00:04:28,741 --> 00:04:32,010
the problem is that beyond is me 
incorrigible that isn't sustainable.

75
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,570
See,
in just a decade,

76
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:37,140
the total cost of the Spanish health 
system has almost doubles and everything

77
00:04:37,141 --> 00:04:37,974
indicates that as a result of the aging 
population and the demand for new and 

78
00:04:40,981 --> 00:04:44,970
expensive health technologies,
this trends will be unstoppable and will

79
00:04:44,971 --> 00:04:45,804
continue to worsen year after year.
And don't think that this only happens 

80
00:04:52,030 --> 00:04:53,200
in Spain,
not at all.

81
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:54,340
In fact,
medical bills,

82
00:04:54,370 --> 00:04:58,240
that is the sustainability of health 
systems is a widespread problem in other

83
00:04:58,241 --> 00:04:59,074
developed countries.
So the question that arises is how can 

84
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:05,840
we overcome these challenges and ensure 
the sustainability of healthcare system

85
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,820
good

86
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:09,653
model,
which has never taken into account 

87
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:13,800
because perhaps speed that have a 
complete the free health system,

88
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:14,693
a system in which demand and supply on 
determines by the market and not in 

89
00:05:17,941 --> 00:05:20,910
political offices.
This could lead to some benefits for one

90
00:05:20,911 --> 00:05:22,560
more money for families.
Thanks Steph.

91
00:05:22,561 --> 00:05:23,394
And lower taxes and a precaution re 
saving level against any ailments that 

92
00:05:26,491 --> 00:05:28,740
may arise that's higher than the present
one.

93
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:29,603
This would allow for direct primary care
payments and insurance against minor 

94
00:05:32,461 --> 00:05:33,510
ailments,
common issues,

95
00:05:33,511 --> 00:05:34,830
and more expensive treatment.

96
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:41,630
Another

97
00:05:41,630 --> 00:05:42,463
benefit would be a greater diversity of 
its competition among different health 

98
00:05:44,781 --> 00:05:45,614
centers.
This would mean they'd given the threat 

99
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:48,920
of being displaced in the market,
it's productivity,

100
00:05:48,921 --> 00:05:51,770
differentiation and innovation would be 
promoted,

101
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:52,663
and other words,
we'd achieved a wide range of services 

102
00:05:54,321 --> 00:05:58,340
that would positively impact both for 
quality of the service and lead to lower

103
00:05:58,341 --> 00:05:59,174
prices.

104
00:06:05,170 --> 00:06:05,400
Cool.

105
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:06,233
Susan is usually the best formula is in 
guarantee better goods and services for 

106
00:06:09,151 --> 00:06:10,620
consumers.
Since health gap,

107
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,513
it's not any different.

108
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:13,830
Okay.

109
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:15,910
How is it nowadays?
New Country Muses.

110
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,690
All of these principles and to know the 
US health care system,

111
00:06:18,691 --> 00:06:21,780
as we'll see,
isn't precisely a free market model.

112
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:23,550
Now,
there is a country that has used some of

113
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:27,630
these characteristics since it has done 
so with extraordinary results.

114
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:32,660
So let's consider Singapore's case model
for health reform.

115
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:44,110
Why now?
Singapore has the best healthcare system

116
00:06:44,111 --> 00:06:47,670
in the world.
It's top quality and costs.

117
00:06:47,671 --> 00:06:48,504
Practically half of that of Spain's 
healthcare system and less than a third 

118
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:57,111
of that of the United States isn't just 
a matter of lower cost is also above all

119
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,010
about quality and results.
See,

120
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:02,883
life expectancy at birth in Singapore is
two to three years longer than in 

121
00:07:05,741 --> 00:07:06,574
Britain or the United States.
It's infant mortality rate is among the 

122
00:07:08,921 --> 00:07:11,980
lowest in the world and just almost half
that of the United States,

123
00:07:11,981 --> 00:07:13,180
Great Britain,
Australia,

124
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,640
Canada,
or France.

125
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:18,403
Generally it's mortality rates are 
impressive compared to most western 

126
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:21,710
countries.
Now,

127
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:25,940
the question we can ask ourselves here 
is how did they achieve such success?

128
00:07:25,970 --> 00:07:26,691
Well,
in this case,

129
00:07:26,691 --> 00:07:29,810
they have achieved at fundamentally by 
using market criteria.

130
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,733
First of all,
the main feature of the Singapore model 

131
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,083
doesn't just lie in the fact that more 
than 60% of all health spending is 

132
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:38,300
private space.
To a large extent,

133
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,970
it is paid directly by users.
That is,

134
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:42,960
copayments is the norm.
Yeah.

135
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,500
Everyone pays the same.
When they go to a hospital,

136
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:53,140
there are public and private centers as 
well as five levels,

137
00:07:53,141 --> 00:07:54,520
five classes a,
b,

138
00:07:54,521 --> 00:07:56,560
one b two Plus B,
two and c.

139
00:07:56,620 --> 00:07:59,200
Each of these letters gives users a 
different service.

140
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:01,540
For example,
class a gets you a private room and it's

141
00:08:01,541 --> 00:08:02,374
my choice of doctor while in class.
See the dream is shattered and the 

142
00:08:04,511 --> 00:08:06,430
doctor is assigned by the hospital.
Of course,

143
00:08:06,460 --> 00:08:09,880
each class has a different cost.
If the user chooses Class A,

144
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,950
they pay for everything.
Instead,

145
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:15,190
if they choose class,
see the government subsidizes 80% of the

146
00:08:15,191 --> 00:08:16,024
cost,

147
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,720
but where do people get the money to pay
for health care?

148
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:22,643
Well,
from the same place as in other 

149
00:08:23,731 --> 00:08:26,700
countries from the wealth that they 
generate from their work.

150
00:08:26,730 --> 00:08:29,610
The difference is that the huge 
contributions that government is usually

151
00:08:29,611 --> 00:08:32,730
collect that saved in Singapore in a 
mandatory way.

152
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,593
Yes,
citizens have a special accounts where 

153
00:08:34,831 --> 00:08:35,664
they keep this money.
They can only use these accounts for 

154
00:08:37,231 --> 00:08:39,480
certain purposes such as paying that 
pensions,

155
00:08:39,481 --> 00:08:42,210
their children's education for their 
home or their health.

156
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,073
In the case of healthcare,
the account is known as medisafe and 

157
00:08:45,181 --> 00:08:47,790
does he use to pay for doctors visits,
hospitalizations,

158
00:08:47,791 --> 00:08:48,870
medications,
et Cetera.

159
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:52,273
This is the second key points of 
Singapore's medical system thanks to 

160
00:08:54,741 --> 00:08:55,574
this formula of demand is self 
regulating and people can manage how to 

161
00:08:57,961 --> 00:09:00,300
spend the money they accumulate in these
accounts.

162
00:09:00,301 --> 00:09:01,134
For example,
by accessing different kinds of cow 

163
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:03,743
whether they want to receive or be 
hospitalized in hospitals with fewer 

164
00:09:06,061 --> 00:09:06,894
comforts but which are cheaper or with 
more services and higher costs 

165
00:09:09,811 --> 00:09:12,180
decreasing redundant and sip after was 
concerned.

166
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,093
Hello?

167
00:09:14,750 --> 00:09:15,583
Very important point is that for most 
serious cases there's universal public 

168
00:09:19,341 --> 00:09:20,174
insurance which is known as a shield 
that it costs only $16 a month for a 30 

169
00:09:24,051 --> 00:09:24,884
year old person and with its of course 
comes the possibility of hiring other 

170
00:09:27,861 --> 00:09:30,050
private insurer.
Is that improve the services?

171
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:33,923
Only.
The third leg of Singapore's health 

172
00:09:34,741 --> 00:09:35,574
system is public expenditure itself.
What happens if someone cannot cover 

173
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,170
their medical bills?
Well,

174
00:09:40,171 --> 00:09:43,600
to guarantee access to healthcare,
the government subsidizes hospitals.

175
00:09:43,601 --> 00:09:46,200
Sound has a public funds.
The Metro funds,

176
00:09:46,201 --> 00:09:49,410
which is designed to pay health bills 
for lower income family.

177
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,370
Sorry

178
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:54,360
folks,
this is how it,

179
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,194
Singapore has managed to create a 
relatively economical medical system 

180
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,474
while achieving results and quality 
levels that placed it among the best 

181
00:10:01,961 --> 00:10:02,794
health systems in the world according to
the World Health Organization and 

182
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:09,010
different rankings such as Bloomberg's 
most efficient healthcare systems.

183
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:13,570
However,
despite all of this,

184
00:10:13,571 --> 00:10:16,330
when we usually talk about healthcare in
the free market,

185
00:10:16,331 --> 00:10:19,360
we automatically think of the United 
States since not Singapore,

186
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:21,100
which is a serious mistake.

187
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,100
Are you listening?

188
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:28,653
Oh,

189
00:10:30,770 --> 00:10:32,480
USA versus Singapore?

190
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:33,703
Oh

191
00:10:34,730 --> 00:10:35,330
yes,
indeed.

192
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:36,163
The U s does not have a European style 
public health system and since the 

193
00:10:39,531 --> 00:10:43,790
country results are quite deplorable,
considering that it spends more than 17%

194
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,624
of its GDP on its healthcare system,
which is quite that of most European 

195
00:10:47,421 --> 00:10:49,190
countries,
the debate on health,

196
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:52,640
it seems settled to private health care 
is worse than public health care because

197
00:10:52,641 --> 00:10:57,200
it costs twice as much and has similar 
or even lower service levels.

198
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:58,063
But this,
as we saw with Singapore where 60% of 

199
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,840
health spending is private simply isn't 
true in Singapore.

200
00:11:02,841 --> 00:11:06,290
The health care system isn't any better.
It's one of the best in the world and it

201
00:11:06,291 --> 00:11:09,800
involves much lower costs than in other 
developed countries.

202
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,513
Okay.

203
00:11:11,810 --> 00:11:12,643
The issue is that the US healthcare 
system isn't only heavily intervenes 

204
00:11:15,261 --> 00:11:17,120
upon it and is regulated by the 
government.

205
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:22,150
It's cost is tremendously socialized.
See,

206
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:23,713
90% of all health spending is channeled 
through two different agents other than 

207
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:30,110
the patients how's of every hundred 
dollars spent in the US health system?

208
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:30,973
45 comes from insurance companies,
45 from state programs such as Medicaid 

209
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:37,970
and only 10% from patients' pockets.

210
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:44,843
Yup.
Public health spending in the United 

211
00:11:46,770 --> 00:11:49,170
States is in relative terms higher,
for example,

212
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,063
than in Spain.
But we're going to talk about that in 

213
00:11:51,631 --> 00:11:52,980
another video.
The fact is,

214
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,080
as we've seen,
Singapore sets a healthcare system model

215
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:59,020
on the table that has a great 
combination of cost,

216
00:11:59,021 --> 00:12:00,790
innovation,
and medical results.

217
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:03,670
We may like some aspects of the system 
and not others,

218
00:12:03,671 --> 00:12:04,504
but I think it wouldn't be unreasonable 
to take it into accounts when talking 

219
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:10,510
about health for future and 
sustainability.
