1
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,630
Amazing is the only rock dance with 
their own private jets.

2
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:13,660
And do you know who the pilot of that 
pilot jet might be?

3
00:00:13,810 --> 00:00:14,441
Well,
yes.

4
00:00:14,441 --> 00:00:17,290
That's none other than the lead singer 
Bruce Dickenson.

5
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:18,213
And listen,
there are not many people who deserve 

6
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:19,804
more admiration than Mr Dickinson.
If it wasn't enough to be one of the 

7
00:00:22,031 --> 00:00:24,310
most successful heavy metal singers in 
history,

8
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,560
he's also an experienced commercial 
pilot,

9
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:28,330
a radio host,
a writer,

10
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:29,263
an ownership into.
I'm the CEO of one of the most 

11
00:00:30,821 --> 00:00:33,130
innovative aviation companies in the 
wells.

12
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:34,120
As you know.
Might be wondering,

13
00:00:34,121 --> 00:00:35,950
well,
why are we talking about Bruce Dickinson

14
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:37,660
on visual politic?
I mean,

15
00:00:37,661 --> 00:00:40,450
what does iron maiden have to do with 
politics at all?

16
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:41,560
Well,
let me

17
00:00:41,590 --> 00:00:42,423
tell you,

18
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:44,673
maiden singer Bruce Dickinson's,
Cardiff aviation signs on to manage 

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,053
national carrier for Djibouti Palsy.
If Aviation is a company that provides 

20
00:00:51,851 --> 00:00:55,870
maintenance to airline companies,
we could say that iron maiden has landed

21
00:00:55,871 --> 00:00:56,704
in Djibouti,
but in this case they didn't come to 

22
00:00:58,841 --> 00:01:00,730
perform.
They came to sell airplanes,

23
00:01:00,731 --> 00:01:05,620
train the pilots and design a system so 
the Djibouti can have its own airlines.

24
00:01:05,710 --> 00:01:10,060
But just wait a minute because this is 
the really important thing here.

25
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:13,150
You might think that the airlines have a
country like judy owns a big deal,

26
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,900
right?
I mean,

27
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:14,733
we're talking about a really poor 
country located in the Horn of Africa 

28
00:01:17,260 --> 00:01:19,580
with a population of less than a million
inhabitants.

29
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,850
Oh,
I thought,

30
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:28,850
what if I told you the debussy has a big
chance of becoming the next Dubai.

31
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:29,753
What if Bruce Dickinson is actually one 
of the first vision reason to decide to 

32
00:01:32,491 --> 00:01:33,324
invest in this country?
Think about it while you look at this 

33
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:36,760
map.
Here it is true,

34
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:40,440
but now this is the Suez Canal and this 
is the Red Sea.

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:45,180
Any oil tanker who wants to go from Abu 
Dhabi to Europe must pass through here.

36
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,150
All of those Chinese mobile phones sold 
in the UK,

37
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:49,103
travel through this area.
We don't have 10 ships that sail the 

38
00:01:51,421 --> 00:01:54,180
planet are passing in front of the 
Djiboutian coasts.

39
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,000
But make no mistake,
this is not a quiet region.

40
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,590
In fact,
the opposite is true.

41
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,570
Remember the Somali pirates?
Well,

42
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,613
this is Somalia and this other thing is 
called [inaudible] and it's not a chill 

43
00:02:04,681 --> 00:02:06,930
place either and this other thing you 
see on the map,

44
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,110
this is called Yemen and it's in the 
middle of a civil war.

45
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,123
It turns out your booties,
the only peaceful country in the entire 

46
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:13,794
room.

47
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:19,330
Now,
hold on a minute once again because they

48
00:02:19,331 --> 00:02:20,710
still more here.
Now,

49
00:02:20,830 --> 00:02:23,740
if you've been following this channel 
for a long time,

50
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,693
you should already know,
but Ethiopia is one of the fastest 

51
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:27,693
growing countries on the planet.
They are becoming a textile superpower 

52
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:33,910
and they have more than 90 million 
inhabitants.

53
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,030
And guess what else?
Ethiopia has got no coast.

54
00:02:37,240 --> 00:02:39,970
This means whenever they want to sell 
their tax dollars,

55
00:02:39,971 --> 00:02:43,360
they have to do so through the Djibouti 
port and yes,

56
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:45,670
I can probably guess what you're 
thinking right now.

57
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:46,653
Are we really talking about a new 
Singapore or Dubai or is the something 

58
00:02:50,591 --> 00:02:51,424
missing here?
I mean maybe you might be thinking now 

59
00:02:52,731 --> 00:02:54,960
what should I be like Bruce Dickinson 
and invest in?

60
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,343
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

61
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:00,520
those questions,
but before do as always,

62
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,640
let's take a look back at the history,
location,

63
00:03:07,381 --> 00:03:08,640
location,
location.

64
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:09,503
I'll do everything I just said about,
but some of you might be thinking right 

65
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:12,660
now.
I mean,

66
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:14,850
why have I never heard of this country 
before?

67
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,713
Well,
the answer to that lies in their 

68
00:03:16,921 --> 00:03:17,754
history,
which is not really very different from 

69
00:03:19,261 --> 00:03:19,760
that.

70
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:20,593
Yes,

71
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,820
in the year 1977,
after a peaceful referendum,

72
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,654
Djibouti became the latest country to 
gain independence from their French 

73
00:03:29,991 --> 00:03:33,590
colonizers and just as it happens in 
similar cases too,

74
00:03:33,591 --> 00:03:38,591
but he became a one party dictate until 
the 19 nineties,

75
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:46,421
Mr Hassan Goulet apted on and other 
members of his tribe controlled the fate

76
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,503
of this country.
Sponsoring members of the opposition 

77
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:53,030
became a common practice and the ruling 
party got really,

78
00:03:53,031 --> 00:03:55,160
really rich off the profits from the 
port.

79
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,173
Now you could say that back then,
GBC was a textbook example of a gate 

80
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:02,960
keeper state.
You see in such poor countries,

81
00:04:02,961 --> 00:04:06,170
the whole economy is dependent on just 
one thing.

82
00:04:06,350 --> 00:04:08,330
In the case of editorial Guinea for 
instance,

83
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,790
that thing is oil.
In the case of Jersey,

84
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:12,380
well that would be it's port.

85
00:04:15,910 --> 00:04:20,320
Since the dictators have no money to pay
a big army to control the whole country,

86
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,273
they must focus all of their oppressive 
powers in the area where the money is 

87
00:04:25,061 --> 00:04:25,894
located,
so Djibouti port was completely secured 

88
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:31,150
while the rest of the country was in 
total chaos.

89
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,580
There were murders on the streets that 
was rape.

90
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:36,580
There were all kinds of other horrific 
crimes.

91
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,440
Now,
as you can probably imagine,

92
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:43,180
this is not the ideal situation to 
create companies or to track any sort of

93
00:04:43,181 --> 00:04:44,014
foreign investments now that in fact 
that in the nineties as civil war 

94
00:04:46,871 --> 00:04:47,704
started between the governments and the 
opposition parties and tribes and it's 

95
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:53,590
all not exactly a recipe for success

96
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,113
as well.
This is where the first difference 

97
00:04:59,131 --> 00:05:03,060
between Djibouti and the rest of their 
neighbor countries comes in.

98
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,260
The way the government's solved their 
problem was surprising to everybody.

99
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,153
Basically,
after years of bloody fighting and 

100
00:05:09,361 --> 00:05:12,090
thousands of killings on both sides of 
the battle,

101
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,380
Mr went to the other party,
the so called fronts for the restoration

102
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:20,310
of unity and democracy and essentially 
said to them,

103
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:21,203
they're dudes.
Okay,

104
00:05:21,210 --> 00:05:23,280
get a grip.
There is money for everyone here.

105
00:05:23,281 --> 00:05:27,110
Why can't we share it all and just stop 
fighting each other and this.

106
00:05:27,111 --> 00:05:30,240
This is how to.
But you got its first unity government,

107
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:33,870
a government that combines most of the 
local political party.

108
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:34,833
Yes.

109
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:40,660
Now there is still political opposition 
in Djibouti though,

110
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:41,494
but they can really not even meet 
campaigns and navy signed that on 

111
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,350
presidential elections.
They are essentially causes.

112
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,293
This explains why Amazon ads laser has 
his nephew the late when the elections 

113
00:05:50,991 --> 00:05:54,170
with outcomes close to 100 percent of 
the vote.

114
00:05:54,230 --> 00:05:55,063
So yes,
it's not exactly a leaving democracy 

115
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,360
bus.
This is just the beginning.

116
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:02,060
Despite the internal fights by the year 
2011,

117
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:07,100
but it was still a very corrupt country 
with a very weak position.

118
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,060
I mean,
think about it.

119
00:06:08,061 --> 00:06:10,160
We're talking about a really small 
country,

120
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:14,270
less than 1 million inhabitants placed 
in the middle of one of the most violent

121
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:19,271
regions on the planet.
I mean Somalia,

122
00:06:20,951 --> 00:06:24,280
which is virtually anarchy where 
different tribes that constantly at each

123
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,500
other's throat span.
Then on the other side,

124
00:06:26,501 --> 00:06:30,910
we have Eritrea a dictatorship that 
makes North Korea looked like Sweden and

125
00:06:30,940 --> 00:06:31,773
in the south of course this Ethiopia,
the biggest regional power and one who 

126
00:06:35,201 --> 00:06:39,280
had any moments would be happy to invade
your booty so they can have a coastline.

127
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:40,173
So in summary,
they were far from being in a peaceful 

128
00:06:42,701 --> 00:06:43,534
situation,
but then when everything seemed to be 

129
00:06:45,791 --> 00:06:46,624
against them,
history decided to give the country a 

130
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:50,110
marvelous break.

131
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,593
Our enemy is a radical network of 
terrorists and every government that 

132
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:57,464
supports them,

133
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:03,040
all of a sudden America with George W 
dot Bush as their president declared war

134
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:08,010
on terrorism and this meant sending 
troops to all the areas where our cells,

135
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,983
what presence,
which includes of course with a Horn of 

136
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:15,400
Africa and is there any better place for
building military basis than shebooty.

137
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,670
It has a peerless location and to 
governments that corrupt as it is,

138
00:07:19,671 --> 00:07:20,504
congratulates itself for being stable 
and having no ties with terrorist 

139
00:07:23,811 --> 00:07:24,650
groups.
Now,

140
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:25,513
do you remember when I told you that the
Red Sea is extremely dangerous for 

141
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:29,930
merchant ships?
You know all the pirates and stuff?

142
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,380
Well,
from the camp lemon airbase,

143
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,233
American troops can chase those Somali 
pirates and not only the Americans can 

144
00:07:35,451 --> 00:07:38,330
do this in 10 years.
The list of countries who have installed

145
00:07:38,331 --> 00:07:41,130
military bases in Djibouti,
it's pretty much never ending.

146
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,153
We can indeed find French,
Italian and Spanish troops that indeed 

147
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:53,600
the only place where Japan has a 
military base abroad is turbidity and as

148
00:07:53,601 --> 00:07:54,434
you might be able to imagine with so 
many wells powers having a military 

149
00:07:57,111 --> 00:07:58,520
presence here,
China,

150
00:07:58,730 --> 00:07:59,563
well,
this is where China comes into the 

151
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:01,270
picture.

152
00:08:01,270 --> 00:08:02,103
Job

153
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,890
Opens first overseas base in Djibouti,
ends.

154
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:08,070
Of course,
in such a poor in small country,

155
00:08:08,071 --> 00:08:11,790
having so many foreign armies is a 
fantastic deal.

156
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:12,601
I mean,
think about it.

157
00:08:12,601 --> 00:08:14,790
All of these soldiers,
they need food to eat,

158
00:08:14,791 --> 00:08:17,070
they have to shop,
and they also need to have some fun.

159
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:21,660
This means lots of jobs,
lots of money for the entire country and

160
00:08:21,661 --> 00:08:24,600
on top of all that,
it's always the biggest problem Djibouti

161
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:25,830
had for investments

162
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:29,850
with

163
00:08:29,850 --> 00:08:30,683
so many military bases in the country,
only an insane best and would dare to 

164
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,500
invade them.
In fact,

165
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,100
there are few places in Africa that are 
safer than shebooty nowadays,

166
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,053
add to this,
the perfect situation for international 

167
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:41,124
trade routes,
and you can easily understand why this 

168
00:08:42,751 --> 00:08:43,584
country has been growing at a five 
percent annual rate since the day 

169
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,100
American troops,
but that boots on the ground,

170
00:08:49,970 --> 00:08:51,870
as you might've guessed.
No,

171
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:55,260
not everything is perfectly wonderful.
Hip spiked this growth.

172
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,830
Djibouti still has an unemployment rate 
higher than 50 percent.

173
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:01,440
Yep.
You heard that right?

174
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,510
One out of two Djibouti eons.
No stable job.

175
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,433
In other words,
these are lines that Bruce Dickinson 

176
00:09:06,470 --> 00:09:11,140
helps creative just sending soldiers and
people from ngos that traveled to places

177
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:12,063
like Somalia or Ethiopia.
That's just wait a minute here because 

178
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:17,920
the times they're certainly changing in 
this country,

179
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:25,560
man and his vision.
Remember this name?

180
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,740
Alias Mosa Dowell a.
Now you might be thinking,

181
00:09:28,741 --> 00:09:30,450
well,
he's the new president rice.

182
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,373
Well,
no,

183
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,213
certainly not to,
but has kept the same president for the 

184
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:36,690
past 20 years.
This man,

185
00:09:36,750 --> 00:09:37,583
well,
he's the minister of Economy and 

186
00:09:39,181 --> 00:09:40,470
finance,
but in this case,

187
00:09:40,471 --> 00:09:43,380
the finance minister is even more famous
than the president.

188
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,963
We needed to plan over a longer period.
We accept that we will probably not be 

189
00:09:50,001 --> 00:09:53,210
able to achieve all of our objectives 
during the current administration.

190
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:54,373
The Vision Twenty,
35 clearly sets out the aspirations of 

191
00:09:56,841 --> 00:09:58,560
the president and his government.
Les.

192
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:00,050
Yes,
Musar Darwalla.

193
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:00,973
Now,
if you've been following visual politic 

194
00:10:01,671 --> 00:10:02,504
for awhile,
this vision 20 slash 35 thing will 

195
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,204
probably remind you of something.
Do you remember this video where I told 

196
00:10:07,551 --> 00:10:10,820
you about Rwanda's road out of poverty?
This vision 20,

197
00:10:10,821 --> 00:10:14,360
35 is a carbon copy of Rwanda's plants.
In many aspects,

198
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:15,373
the gbt governments wants their ports to
have state of the art technology just 

199
00:10:18,441 --> 00:10:22,310
like those of Singapore and Dubai for 
this while they need money,

200
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,800
but not only that,
Aa also knows there's.

201
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:25,634
In order to make the economy work,
you need to diversify as if a country 

202
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:33,174
only relies on one single industry.
A small crisis could easily be the 

203
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:38,250
country's downfold.
That again,

204
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:39,173
if you want to diversify your economy,
you still need money and you need a 

205
00:10:41,701 --> 00:10:42,534
business friendly environments and 
corruption and lack of rule of law up 

206
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,310
seldom.
Friends have businesses,

207
00:10:47,311 --> 00:10:49,590
kinds of foreign investments,
and in these areas,

208
00:10:49,750 --> 00:10:51,660
Djibouti,
while they get a gold medal,

209
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,060
for example,
despite the poor being the main economic

210
00:10:54,061 --> 00:10:57,210
driver in this country,
nobody can see the accounting books.

211
00:10:57,300 --> 00:10:58,133
This means many governments officials 
are getting rich or without anyone 

212
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:02,334
knowing.

213
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,013
If this was not enough,
part of the local legislation is based 

214
00:11:08,121 --> 00:11:08,954
on sharia law.
Nobody can even protest this fact 

215
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:12,373
because Djibouti is among the 10 
countries with the lowest freedom of 

216
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:17,300
speech in the entire world.
In just 2016,

217
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:18,134
the government sent three BBC 
journalists to jail because they wanted 

218
00:11:21,351 --> 00:11:23,540
to talk about election fraud.
Now,

219
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:24,463
as you can imagine,
this is certainly hurting the country's 

220
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,610
opportunities and what's worse?
Well,

221
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:31,160
it's almost impossible to change the 
system.

222
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,293
At the end of the day.
The ruling class is already making 

223
00:11:34,221 --> 00:11:36,470
enough money from the port and the 
rents.

224
00:11:36,471 --> 00:11:38,440
They guess from all of those foreign 
army

225
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:42,740
feather.

226
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:43,573
They also have enough security that 
makes them not afraid of a popular 

227
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,910
uprising.
In other words,

228
00:11:46,911 --> 00:11:50,150
if Dalloway the finance minister,
wanted to change the political system,

229
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,073
and as he says in his vision 20,
35 paper and prove the governance over 

230
00:11:54,071 --> 00:11:56,680
the country,
he has an impossible job,

231
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,823
right?
Well,

232
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:59,980
dear viewer,
well sometimes miracles,

233
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,090
they do happen.

234
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:06,680
Jody breaks ground on massive Chinese 
backed free trade zone.

235
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,850
In other words,
if you've gone,

236
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,970
Shane's the whole political system in 
the entire country,

237
00:12:11,090 --> 00:12:14,930
just change a little part of it.
In this special economic zone,

238
00:12:14,931 --> 00:12:18,650
everyone can buy property and build 
without having to wait months and months

239
00:12:18,651 --> 00:12:21,710
to get government permission.
This makes it harder for governments.

240
00:12:21,711 --> 00:12:24,500
Officials who wants to take bribes.
Now,

241
00:12:24,501 --> 00:12:25,334
on the other hand is all of the 
regulations are going to follow Chinese 

242
00:12:27,381 --> 00:12:28,220
law.
Essentially.

243
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:31,520
This is a little short of a tiny little 
shenzen in the middle of a country.

244
00:12:34,790 --> 00:12:37,610
The agreement calls for the zone to 
handle $7,000,000,000

245
00:12:37,611 --> 00:12:39,710
worth of trade,
or within two years,

246
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:41,023
Judi will create a unified customer 
system with trainer establish a trade 

247
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:49,091
center and set up a currency clearance.
Well,

248
00:12:52,451 --> 00:12:54,490
what can we expect now?
Well,

249
00:12:54,491 --> 00:12:55,324
the idea of making special economic 
zones is certainly nothing new and it's 

250
00:12:58,601 --> 00:13:00,820
been proven to work many times.
In fact,

251
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:05,560
this is the system that let Dubai become
the metropolis that it is today.

252
00:13:05,650 --> 00:13:08,140
The idea is that when you have a special
economic zone,

253
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:09,003
both the citizens and the political 
leads can see firsthand what happens 

254
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:16,510
when you have transparent laws and a 
good framework for companies to follow.

255
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,693
If this experiment works,
politicians will be more willing to 

256
00:13:22,801 --> 00:13:25,650
implement real changes in the rest of 
the country.

257
00:13:25,740 --> 00:13:27,150
All right,
so in summary,

258
00:13:27,151 --> 00:13:27,984
we have an African country where 
security is granted by foreign armies 

259
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,050
and he was starting to apply serious 
reforms.

260
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,033
We have a country with the perfect 
location in science to become a 

261
00:13:37,021 --> 00:13:41,310
financial and logistical sensor in one 
of the busiest areas on the planets.

262
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:45,750
So it seems that Mr Dickinson has found 
a virgin paradise for investments.

263
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,950
Doesn't it?
Well,

264
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,370
hold on just a second because this does 
not enjoy.

265
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:53,280
Beauty is going to become a freedom and 
human rights haven.

266
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,100
I mean at the end of the day,
neither China nor does by.

267
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,020
Oh really?
Such havens either.

268
00:13:58,110 --> 00:14:02,730
But this can be at least the beginning 
of the end for poverty in this region.

269
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:07,803
So the question now is,
what do you think these positive 

270
00:14:10,061 --> 00:14:12,160
predictions do you think they'll become 
true?

271
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,143
Is this a good time to invest in 
Djibouti or is this going to amount to 

272
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,250
nothing more than just hopeful 
predictions?

273
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,193
Well,
do leave your answer in the comments 

274
00:14:20,321 --> 00:14:21,154
section below.
And if you want to know why do you buy 

275
00:14:22,791 --> 00:14:23,561
as say,
rich?

276
00:14:23,561 --> 00:14:26,050
Well check out this video.
Here's a spoiler.

277
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,420
It has nothing to do with oil.
