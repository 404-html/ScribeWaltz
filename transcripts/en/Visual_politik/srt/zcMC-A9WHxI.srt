1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:10,330
It is the fifth most valuable company in
the wells.

3
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,430
Each minutes of the company brings in 
more than $250,000

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:16,293
it's income in 2016 was more than $136 
billion and you know what's the best 

5
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:24,090
part is the company is only 23 years 
old.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,520
[inaudible]

7
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,790
this is to say according to our 
demographics there at visual politic,

8
00:00:32,791 --> 00:00:36,660
Amazon is probably younger than you.
That was a time in history when the most

9
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,240
powerful nations look to build huge 
empires.

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,290
The British,
the Spanish,

11
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:41,310
the Romans,
the Mongols.

12
00:00:41,311 --> 00:00:45,950
Today things are rather different though
it seems that the great nations of years

13
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:49,830
past to being substituted by new massive
technology corporations.

14
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,170
As an example of this,
we have the Amazon App.

15
00:00:58,490 --> 00:01:00,950
When this it is not just a figure of 
speech.

16
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:03,440
Let's imagine that you wanted to buy 
Amazon,

17
00:01:03,441 --> 00:01:06,320
which is now the unquestionable leader 
of the commerce.

18
00:01:06,350 --> 00:01:09,200
Have you got any idea how much you would
have to pay for this company?

19
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,850
Come on,
just try and guess at it.

20
00:01:16,690 --> 00:01:17,523
Well,
the actual figure is $420 billion as of 

21
00:01:20,261 --> 00:01:23,950
the recording of this video,
that's nearly half a trillion dollars,

22
00:01:23,951 --> 00:01:28,690
which is a truly incredible figure.
This is because Amazon stock has tripled

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,553
since 2015 which has made Amazon the 
unquestionable star of the market as 

24
00:01:38,291 --> 00:01:41,800
this is not just a matter of numbers.
It's also a matter of reality.

25
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,690
I mean,
who hasn't heard of Amazon?

26
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:47,530
I'm as an is Dhea view the biggest 
ecommerce company in the wells,

27
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:50,050
but oh,
that is so much more.

28
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,110
Did you know that it's also the world's 
leader in Web services?

29
00:01:57,770 --> 00:02:00,320
I'm the still more than that.
24 hour delivery,

30
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:01,220
ebooks,
tablets,

31
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,380
cloud services,
and even trucks,

32
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,330
planes and ships.
Right now,

33
00:02:05,331 --> 00:02:06,164
while you're watching this video,
Amazon is working out how to reduce 

34
00:02:08,331 --> 00:02:10,790
their dependence on big logistics 
companies,

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,693
notably with the company deciding to 
move into the shipping industry and a 

36
00:02:14,001 --> 00:02:14,834
great deal of the company's success can 
be put down to its delivery time with 

37
00:02:17,661 --> 00:02:18,494
some deliveries today,
even happening on the same day as the 

38
00:02:21,171 --> 00:02:22,004
order.
Why don't we set everything as it does 

39
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:29,150
is in the online world,
this is starting to

40
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:30,083
change the leaders of the company,
especially the president and main 

41
00:02:33,871 --> 00:02:34,704
shareholder.
Jeff Bezos want to occupy the entire 

42
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,584
market and they've realized that sill 
more than 90% of all purchases are made 

43
00:02:41,701 --> 00:02:43,890
in traditional brick and mortar shops.

44
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:45,853
What does it happen to?
This potential of the company leaders 

45
00:02:47,301 --> 00:02:49,760
have set the goal of revolutionizing 
commerce,

46
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,460
not just ecommerce,
but physical commerce.

47
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:54,770
Well,
this has already started.

48
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:55,803
Amazon already has several bookstores 
available in the United States and even 

49
00:02:59,441 --> 00:03:02,050
about to open Amazon,
go to the public,

50
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:04,750
the first supermarket without cashiers

51
00:03:09,510 --> 00:03:10,343
prized whether you should be.
Because what Amazon is looking to do is 

52
00:03:12,421 --> 00:03:16,260
dominate this market as well.
And as well as Amazon is apt to do,

53
00:03:16,261 --> 00:03:18,960
they will keep on trying until they 
succeed.

54
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:21,120
Up until now,
most offline companies,

55
00:03:21,121 --> 00:03:22,050
both big,
medium,

56
00:03:22,051 --> 00:03:24,810
and small have suffered because of 
online competition.

57
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,110
So imagine what could happen if Amazon 
brings its competition to the physical.

58
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:29,200
Yes.

59
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,033
Marquez

60
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:34,100
not at all.
Think of the consequences that can arise

61
00:03:34,101 --> 00:03:36,080
from the automation of jobs in this 
area,

62
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,160
which is Bali.
The way,

63
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:39,290
one of the areas which employs the most 
people.

64
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,300
All right,
so it's still too soon to have the media

65
00:03:41,301 --> 00:03:42,134
concerns,
but if you own a store or your work in 

66
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:46,220
one,
maybe it's time to consider what's going

67
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:47,510
to happen over the coming years.

68
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,403
Yes,

69
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,620
Amazon effect

70
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:54,683
recurring messages during Donald Trump's
presidential campaign was the 

71
00:03:57,031 --> 00:03:57,864
competition with countries like China or
Mexico was making American industry 

72
00:04:01,261 --> 00:04:02,094
disappear.
That is why in order to protect and 

73
00:04:03,661 --> 00:04:07,440
recover all of those jobs from seeks to 
put barriers against foreign trade,

74
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:09,780
specifically targeting imports.
The problem in here,

75
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:10,643
folks,
as we have already seen in previous 

76
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:15,030
visual politic videos,
is that this doesn't really work.

77
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:17,130
Now,
it is true that 7 million jobs have been

78
00:04:17,131 --> 00:04:19,410
lost in American industry in the last 
decades,

79
00:04:19,411 --> 00:04:22,200
but it isn't because factories have 
disappeared.

80
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:23,850
Not at all.
In fact,

81
00:04:23,851 --> 00:04:27,330
industrial production in the U S is 
almost higher than it's ever been.

82
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,713
B,

83
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:35,730
there's so many jobs have been lost is 
not because of the closing of factories,

84
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,520
but because of the new industrial 
reality.

85
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:42,450
Factories need less workers due to 
automated systems like robots.

86
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,141
All right?
All right,

87
00:04:43,141 --> 00:04:46,110
so now you might be wondering why you're
telling us all of this.

88
00:04:46,111 --> 00:04:49,620
Isn't this a video without Amazon and 
here we are hearing about Donald Trump?

89
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:50,850
Well,
yes it is.

90
00:04:50,910 --> 00:04:51,743
And here's why.
It's relevance between the impact of 

91
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:54,233
ECOMMERCE,
which is growing more and more popular 

92
00:04:56,041 --> 00:04:59,550
plus this scenario of Amazon developing 
their automated supermarkets.

93
00:04:59,580 --> 00:05:00,413
It's easy to imagine how many companies 
will go bankrupt and the quantity of 

94
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,820
jobs that will be lost in this sector 
alone.

95
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,430
But you know what?
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

96
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:10,350
Oh,
I mean it will be if we don't find a way

97
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:11,184
to adapt,
but if we do our own marked benefits as 

98
00:05:13,951 --> 00:05:16,140
an example today,
if there are more than 100,000

99
00:05:16,141 --> 00:05:20,070
companies working with Amazon who earn 
more than $100,000

100
00:05:20,071 --> 00:05:21,590
per year look bad

101
00:05:21,770 --> 00:05:22,603
price,

102
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:26,880
as always,
the majority of people in businesses are

103
00:05:26,881 --> 00:05:30,090
behind the times.
We are simply not ready and prepared for

104
00:05:30,091 --> 00:05:32,760
the changes that are coming as without 
being ready and prepared.

105
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:35,580
It will be almost impossible to adapt in
time.

106
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,563
But all of that said,
let's take our focus back to Amazon and 

107
00:05:38,821 --> 00:05:42,430
to a much more interesting subject,
and that subject is money.

108
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:47,460
Okay,

109
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:48,293
gold mine

110
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:50,230
know.
I knew

111
00:05:50,230 --> 00:05:51,063
what you're thinking.
If Amazon is so successful and it's 

112
00:05:52,901 --> 00:05:56,710
worth more than $400 billion,
it's got to be a gold mine.

113
00:05:56,740 --> 00:05:59,720
Right,
and incredible money making machine.

114
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:03,350
Well not exactly.
At least for the time being.

115
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,273
It is true.
They're results are improving every 

116
00:06:05,721 --> 00:06:08,500
year.
Then 2016 when it was no exceptions,

117
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:10,603
Amazon has submitted record results.
The company has a surplus of two 

118
00:06:17,780 --> 00:06:17,960
thousand three hundred and seventy one 
million dollars.

119
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,670
That is a lot of money,
isn't it?

120
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,683
But the problem is that if we were to 
buy Amazon for that $400 billion in the 

121
00:06:23,901 --> 00:06:24,734
company kept returning that amount of 
money every year or why they would take 

122
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:30,050
us almost 180 years to recoup our 
investment.

123
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,913
So considering this,
it doesn't actually sound like that 

124
00:06:33,251 --> 00:06:34,550
great of an investment.

125
00:06:39,430 --> 00:06:41,050
Well,
just to know if a company makes money on

126
00:06:41,051 --> 00:06:42,340
us,
like real money,

127
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:43,203
I like to try something.
It's a test and that test is to look at 

128
00:06:46,001 --> 00:06:46,834
the amount of money,
but it's really coming and going in the 

129
00:06:49,121 --> 00:06:49,841
company.
Well,

130
00:06:49,841 --> 00:06:50,674
in the last five years,
Amazon has brought in a surplus of more 

131
00:06:53,201 --> 00:06:56,950
than 15 point $5 billion.
The numbers get better,

132
00:06:56,951 --> 00:07:00,700
but it's still relatively low compared 
to the purchase price of the company.

133
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:03,820
So now you might be wondering what 
exactly is going on here?

134
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:06,520
Why is Amazon worth quite so much?
Well,

135
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,570
you see,
Jeff Bezos,

136
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,910
the presidents of Amazon,
has a strategy,

137
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:14,380
invest all he can to reach new markets 
and improve the company's service.

138
00:07:14,410 --> 00:07:15,243
Consider this.
In 2016 Amazon launched prime video to 

139
00:07:18,431 --> 00:07:20,560
compete with Netflix and HBO.
Well,

140
00:07:20,561 --> 00:07:25,540
this year Amazon is going to spend $4 
billion on films and TV series.

141
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:28,210
And other example is the so called 
project everest.

142
00:07:28,270 --> 00:07:29,103
In the next years,
Amazon is going to invest billions of 

143
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:33,290
dollars in order to come to the market 
leader in.

144
00:07:33,570 --> 00:07:34,403
Yeah.

145
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:38,540
In fact,
it is said that the company is trying to

146
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:42,860
open hundreds of shops in this country.
So these are the reasons why the company

147
00:07:42,861 --> 00:07:43,694
is worth so much.
Investors expect their business to take 

148
00:07:47,661 --> 00:07:50,510
off in the next few years.
Following this,

149
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,493
Morgan Stanley and Credit Suisse to 
powerful investment banks expect Amazon 

150
00:07:55,881 --> 00:08:00,530
to be the main character of the largest 
expansion in the history of business.

151
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,730
How much are we really talking about 
here?

152
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:06,800
Well,
estimates are that in a few years,

153
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:07,634
the income of Amazon will exceed $500 
billion more than four times that of 

154
00:08:11,301 --> 00:08:14,060
2016 as well.
Banks understand that,

155
00:08:14,061 --> 00:08:17,960
and that means money is going to 
continue flowing through Amazon's vein,

156
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:22,910
new empire.

157
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,140
It's

158
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:26,760
like does that mean that Amazon is going
to conquer the world?

159
00:08:26,761 --> 00:08:27,594
So to say?
Now we have to admit that Amazon's 

160
00:08:28,611 --> 00:08:29,444
success has been pretty overwhelming and
their company couldn't really be doing 

161
00:08:32,161 --> 00:08:33,240
much better.
However,

162
00:08:33,241 --> 00:08:36,690
it's also important to remember that 
competition is everywhere.

163
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:37,860
IBM,
Microsoft,

164
00:08:37,861 --> 00:08:38,581
apple,
Walmart,

165
00:08:38,581 --> 00:08:39,414
Alibaba.
These vast companies are not going to 

166
00:08:41,671 --> 00:08:45,600
merely be spectators here and let's 
consider the final company.

167
00:08:45,601 --> 00:08:50,601
We mentioned that Ali Baba for Queen of 
Chinese e commerce in China.

168
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:51,833
Amazon has experienced a massive 
disappointment despite investing great 

169
00:08:55,651 --> 00:08:56,484
deal of money.
Amazon's market share is less than 1% 

170
00:08:59,160 --> 00:08:59,993
and wait for more because the Chinese 
companies are going to be the talk of 

171
00:09:03,271 --> 00:09:04,104
the town for all these reasons.
Div some something that Amazon will 

172
00:09:07,081 --> 00:09:07,914
become the Super Company if the 21st 
century and builds up to an embalmer 

173
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,673
that's on the country or this thing that
it's a fantastic company but it's worth 

174
00:09:15,541 --> 00:09:20,130
and expectations are a bit of a bubble 
based exaggeration for now though we can

175
00:09:20,131 --> 00:09:22,380
say for sure that there is one clear 
winner.

176
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,370
Jeff Bezos is now the world's second 
richest person.

177
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,960
Bezos has a net worth of 75 point $6 
billion.

178
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,303
But one thing is for sure there is still
a huge battle to be fought in this 

179
00:09:35,461 --> 00:09:37,860
relatively new land known as the 
Internet.

180
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:39,960
So that's our opinion here at visual 
politic.

181
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,790
And now we would love to know what you 
think.

182
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:44,460
Do you think Amazon will achieve its 
goal of taking over?

183
00:09:44,461 --> 00:09:45,720
Well,
pretty much everything.

184
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:49,530
Well it start making massive amounts of 
money or will the competition stop it?

185
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,750
