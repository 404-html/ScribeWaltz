1
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:09,743
Don't want us to become something like 
the Asian version of Asterix and Obelix 

2
00:00:12,291 --> 00:00:13,124
is irreducible village,
a small enclave surrounded by a great 

3
00:00:16,191 --> 00:00:17,024
empire that wants to engulf.
It ends as with the small Gaelic 

4
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:20,683
village.
The citizens of Taiwan also have their 

5
00:00:21,891 --> 00:00:25,730
own magic potion to defend themselves 
against their enemies.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,960
Of course,
in this case,

7
00:00:26,961 --> 00:00:29,150
we aren't talking about potions made by 
a druid.

8
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:33,050
We're talking about the power of the 
United States of America.

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,550
Well,
the United States,

10
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:37,250
and also reasonably well something else 
folks.

11
00:00:37,251 --> 00:00:38,084
Taiwan has a new ally,
a new secret advantage that is already 

12
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,850
fueling Beijing's wrath,
so listen up.

13
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:54,110
Beijing's rat one is facing enormous 
pressure from mainland China,

14
00:00:55,801 --> 00:00:56,634
which as you know,
planes the island as part of its 

15
00:00:58,651 --> 00:00:59,484
territory,
and we're not talking about the usual 

16
00:01:01,111 --> 00:01:04,650
international politics tug of war where 
you know the usual.

17
00:01:04,651 --> 00:01:06,120
You get to that.
Can you take it?

18
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:07,770
I get angry,
I threaten you.

19
00:01:07,771 --> 00:01:12,771
Then we ultimately let it be known.
That is not the situation here at all.

20
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,110
Beijing,
they've actually even set a deadline.

21
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:19,673
The Chinese government has made it clear
time and time again that it's ready to 

22
00:01:22,501 --> 00:01:24,540
do what it takes,
and the fourth year,

23
00:01:24,541 --> 00:01:25,374
20,
49 for the centennial of the People's 

24
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,183
Republic of China,
Taiwan will have to rejoin mainland 

25
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,120
China.

26
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:32,953
Yeah.

27
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,163
Course.
This leads to a problem maddens and not 

28
00:01:37,281 --> 00:01:41,080
exactly a small one that I went is 
they're not really in favor of it.

29
00:01:41,270 --> 00:01:42,710
In fact,
they want nothing to do with it.

30
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:45,843
In fact,
as we mentioned here on visual politic 

31
00:01:46,991 --> 00:01:47,824
in 2016,
the Democratic Progressive Party of 

32
00:01:49,691 --> 00:01:53,650
sight in Wang who by the way,
it was one of our 2017 are award winning

33
00:01:53,651 --> 00:01:54,484
leaders of the year and there's 
something of an independent games at 

34
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:58,540
power in Taiwan.
All the power,

35
00:01:58,690 --> 00:02:01,990
both of Congress and the presidency.
And since then,

36
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:05,230
let's just say Beijing hasn't taken it 
very well.

37
00:02:05,290 --> 00:02:06,310
Uh,
in fact,

38
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:08,230
that wouldn't be accurate.
They took it horrible.

39
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:11,753
Tying Wang became president practically 
from the very first minute Beijing's 

40
00:02:14,671 --> 00:02:17,010
pressures against the island have 
multiplied.

41
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:20,910
And in recent months it's already 
reached politically obsessive levels.

42
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:21,803
They've cut diplomatic ties,
try to punish Taiwan economically and 

43
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:27,660
have implemented huge military exercises
all around the island.

44
00:02:30,130 --> 00:02:30,963
That's not all Tszujing things.
Government is also using all leds means 

45
00:02:33,581 --> 00:02:33,861
to,
uh,

46
00:02:33,861 --> 00:02:36,220
raise Taiwan's name and identity from 
the map.

47
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,083
For example,
when we published our first video about 

48
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,574
Taiwan,
20 countries formally recognize the 

49
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:44,890
islands government in Taipei is China's 
legitimate government.

50
00:02:44,950 --> 00:02:46,330
Yes,
as we've covered before,

51
00:02:46,331 --> 00:02:48,430
Taiwan has never declared its 
independence,

52
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:51,760
but for years it's claimed it's China's 
legitimate government.

53
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:56,380
And of course diplomatically our country
can only have one recognize government.

54
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:03,063
Well,
Beijing has multiplied its diplomatic 

55
00:03:04,421 --> 00:03:07,810
agenda to end the situation today,
just a year later.

56
00:03:07,811 --> 00:03:11,980
Only 17 countries consider it so,
and almost all of them are tiny,

57
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:13,210
but that's not all.
In fact,

58
00:03:13,211 --> 00:03:16,360
given the circumstances,
Beijing's move would be understandable.

59
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,090
Something like you're,
I'm the legitimate government of China,

60
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:22,980
but this is no longer a question of 
who's the legitimate governments,

61
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,833
but simply the Beijing has said both 
actively and passively that it will 

62
00:03:27,551 --> 00:03:30,340
never allow Taiwan to become 
independent.

63
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,233
And one way to prevent that is precisely
by trying to erase all traces of the 

64
00:03:34,901 --> 00:03:35,734
islands.
National identity tried essentially he 

65
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:39,490
wants people to think Taiwan wants that 
car.

66
00:03:39,491 --> 00:03:44,170
Brands you see in order to pull this 
off,

67
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,004
Beijing is blocking the presence of 
Taiwanese representatives and even it's 

68
00:03:47,981 --> 00:03:51,010
journalists from all of the 
international bodies that it can,

69
00:03:51,011 --> 00:03:51,844
such as the World Health Organization,
it's finding companies that sell 

70
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:57,490
products in China with the mainland 
Taiwan label.

71
00:03:57,520 --> 00:04:00,050
This is something that has happened to 
the Japanese Jane Muji.

72
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,130
Another case we know about is that of 
the gap clothing Shane,

73
00:04:03,131 --> 00:04:03,964
which had to apologize for selling tee 
shirts in North America that didn't 

74
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:10,060
include Taiwan as part of China.
Even say when he's music groups like the

75
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:11,610
Indie punk band,
fire axe.

76
00:04:11,611 --> 00:04:12,444
So you don't support the reunification 
are disappearing from Chinese streaming 

77
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:18,880
music services.
And how about one more example?

78
00:04:18,940 --> 00:04:20,500
Well,
due to Beijing's threats,

79
00:04:20,501 --> 00:04:24,160
airlines from all over the world and no 
longer using the islands name.

80
00:04:24,190 --> 00:04:25,390
Yep.
You're really did hear that,

81
00:04:25,391 --> 00:04:26,224
right?
Even American companies aren't using 

82
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:29,230
Taiwan's name anymore.
I mean,

83
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,093
yes,
you can absolutely book a ticket from 

84
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:34,630
New York to Taipei,
but don't ask which country you're going

85
00:04:34,631 --> 00:04:37,090
to.
Although yes,

86
00:04:37,091 --> 00:04:37,924
unlike other international companies 
such as British Airways or Lufthansa or 

87
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:42,340
who are already selling tickets to 
Taiwan,

88
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,193
this part of China,
American companies have simply resorted 

89
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,323
to the ghost country trek.
The ghost country trick is them just 

90
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:51,040
selling tickets to Taipei and when 
anyone asks,

91
00:04:51,041 --> 00:04:52,990
it's just a response of who cares.

92
00:04:55,170 --> 00:04:56,003
We can't blame them.
The trainees aviation market is simply 

93
00:04:57,851 --> 00:05:01,630
too big and many companies have direct 
interests in that country.

94
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:05,290
Trainers goal regarding Taiwan has never
changed.

95
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:07,300
That goal is just swallow up.
Taiwan,

96
00:05:07,301 --> 00:05:09,940
sovereignty,
exterminate Taiwanese democracy,

97
00:05:09,941 --> 00:05:10,774
and achieved ultimate unification Lee 
tongue where Taiwan's first 

98
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:14,554
democratically elected president to the 
New York Times without getting any 

99
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,274
further.
American Airlines is a shareholder of 

100
00:05:19,511 --> 00:05:21,790
China,
Southern Airlines and Delta on the other

101
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,680
hands of China,
Eastern Airlines.

102
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:24,543
However,
just a moment here because it's not all 

103
00:05:26,621 --> 00:05:29,430
bad news for Taiwan along with the US is
support.

104
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,750
The island has gains and other powerful 
ally,

105
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,613
or you could say hi.
One is developing its own magic potion 

106
00:05:35,741 --> 00:05:38,170
that no,
I'm not talking about weapons.

107
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:43,200
Listen Up Mecca

108
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,290
folks.

109
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,820
Taiwan has been chosen as the first 
Asian host of the Oslo Freedom Forum,

110
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,830
like a Congress and international 
meeting on human rights,

111
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,230
but some of you might be wondering a 
congress,

112
00:06:03,231 --> 00:06:06,170
I mean is that rarely so important while
devalue it.

113
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:08,630
In fact,
it is not so much for the congress,

114
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:10,520
but ultimately what it means.

115
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,430
Even though

116
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:18,530
global democracy has experienced a 
general trend of backsliding in the past

117
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,403
few years,
Taiwan's democracy has persisted and 

118
00:06:20,851 --> 00:06:21,684
continues to thrive.
Taiwan can continue to serve as an 

119
00:06:24,001 --> 00:06:27,330
inspiration to Democrats in Asia,
including those in China.

120
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,283
Ketty Jen,
vice president of the Taiwan Foundation 

121
00:06:30,541 --> 00:06:31,374
for democracy.

122
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,440
You see,
for decades,

123
00:06:32,441 --> 00:06:33,274
Hong Kong was the great bastion of 
freedom of expression in this area of 

124
00:06:36,911 --> 00:06:37,744
the world.
So if international media and human 

125
00:06:40,571 --> 00:06:43,330
rights organizations establish their 
headquarters there,

126
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:44,223
and not only that,
Hong Kong mostly became a refuge for 

127
00:06:45,711 --> 00:06:47,710
many political exiles.
Like for example,

128
00:06:47,711 --> 00:06:50,530
the student leaders who lead the 
Tiananmen Square protest.

129
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,903
However,
in recent times as we've seen here on 

130
00:06:54,621 --> 00:06:55,454
visual politic,
things have changed and Beijing has 

131
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,260
tightened its grip on Hong Kong's 
politics.

132
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:15,210
Kong was originally the first choice for
the Asia Bureau,

133
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,060
but today China doesn't just suppress 
its own people.

134
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,600
It is now increasingly exporting that 
suppression to Hong Kong.

135
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:22,493
Will Eric,
I see an emeritus member of Reporters 

136
00:07:24,721 --> 00:07:29,721
Without Borders and a student leader of 
the 1989 tiananmen protests

137
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,120
boss.
As this change was taking place,

138
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:32,954
Taiwan consolidated itself as a vibrant 
democracy and one of the freest places 

139
00:07:36,981 --> 00:07:39,170
in the region,
but that's precisely why it's replacing.

140
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:43,310
Hong Kong is the Mecca for freedom 
activists and human rights in Asia.

141
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:44,203
This is even though Taiwan until 1987,
was under the control of an ironclad 

142
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,710
dictatorship.
Now,

143
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:00,374
for example,
one of the human rights film festivals 

144
00:08:02,031 --> 00:08:04,850
that used to be held in Hong Kong has 
been moved to Taiwan.

145
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:05,750
Lamb,
winky,

146
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:06,613
one of the Hong Kong book publishers who
was kidnapped by the Chinese government 

147
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:10,213
two years ago has announced that he will
reopen his bookstore in Taiwan and 

148
00:08:13,401 --> 00:08:14,234
Reporters Without Borders announced in 
2017 that it's first Asian office will 

149
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:18,980
be in Tai Pei.

150
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:22,490
Freedom of expression is a big part of 
Taiwanese culture.

151
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:26,930
Cedric the Taipei bureau director of 
Reporters Without Borders.

152
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:29,990
These are just some examples of what it 
was already becoming.

153
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,580
A generalized trends,
democracy,

154
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,530
political plurality,
freedom of expression,

155
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:35,270
human rights,
same sex marriage.

156
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:36,133
Taiwan is becoming a benchmark for all 
of them and obviously this poses a huge 

157
00:08:39,681 --> 00:08:41,360
problem for China's interests.

158
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:42,490
Yeah,

159
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:44,440
for one,
the Taiwanese love freedom,

160
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:48,840
so of course they don't want anything to
do with being ruled again by Beijing and

161
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,570
for another while the Chinese government
attempts to erase,

162
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,370
to annihilate at the time when he's 
identity throughout the wells,

163
00:08:54,371 --> 00:08:58,890
the country has suddenly emerged as a 
center of freedom with all the influence

164
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,040
that that entails.
Also,

165
00:09:02,041 --> 00:09:02,874
it's much harder to consider attacking a
country that is famous for its 

166
00:09:05,551 --> 00:09:08,700
commitment to human rights.
International community simply would not

167
00:09:08,701 --> 00:09:09,534
accept it,
and the truth is that this maybe 

168
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:16,580
Taiwan's best move this one up,
the new move,

169
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,163
July 2018,
the second Apache helicopter squadron 

170
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,433
made in Taiwan went into service.
It's part of what is strengthening the 

171
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:33,950
partnership between Washington and 
Taipei,

172
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:36,900
of which incidentally we're going to 
speak about in a future video.

173
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:37,793
Among other things,
this includes a significant increase in 

174
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:42,750
the sale of equipment and military 
technology to the island.

175
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,050
One is buying helicopters,
tanks,

176
00:09:46,051 --> 00:09:48,000
missiles,
anti aircraft systems,

177
00:09:48,030 --> 00:09:50,730
and now even wants to develop its own 
submarines.

178
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,410
However,
despite all of this,

179
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,840
it seems increasingly clear that 
militarily,

180
00:09:54,870 --> 00:09:57,450
it'll be difficult for Taiwan to stop 
China.

181
00:09:57,480 --> 00:10:00,570
The budget difference is simply 
overwhelming.

182
00:10:00,630 --> 00:10:01,463
China's military budget is between 15 
and 20 times that of Taiwan and it 

183
00:10:05,671 --> 00:10:06,504
shows,

184
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:08,280
yes,

185
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:09,113
yes,
it's true nowadays there's the United 

186
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:11,573
States umbrella,
but even that isn't enough to have the 

187
00:10:13,171 --> 00:10:16,140
guarantee that the international 
community would act in their favor.

188
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,740
Taiwan needs to reinforce its influence 
in the world,

189
00:10:19,741 --> 00:10:22,500
especially if it wants to become an 
independent country.

190
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,363
Now the question we need to ask 
ourselves here is how on earth I think 

191
00:10:26,511 --> 00:10:28,020
going to be able to achieve this?

192
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:34,220
Well,
folks that may surprise you,

193
00:10:34,221 --> 00:10:35,054
the military strategy,
while essential may not actually be the 

194
00:10:37,851 --> 00:10:38,684
most important thing here,
Taiwan has to gain influence and 

195
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:41,864
prominence in the world while overcoming
the economic problems that we talked 

196
00:10:44,571 --> 00:10:46,520
about in a previous video.
To do so,

197
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:47,540
it can,
for example,

198
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,980
seek to attract students from all over 
Asia and indeed the world by giving them

199
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,843
facilities,
promoting programs in English and 

200
00:10:54,221 --> 00:10:55,054
attracting first grade teachers.
That would mean gaining a lot of 

201
00:10:57,651 --> 00:11:00,620
influence and of course human capital.
Seconds,

202
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:01,483
Taiwan can set in motion and aggressive 
policy to attract multinationals and to 

203
00:11:04,581 --> 00:11:06,920
get them to establish not only factories
here,

204
00:11:06,921 --> 00:11:10,790
but above all research centers and 
administrative headquarters.

205
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:14,960
They can do so by devoting special 
attention to attracting content creation

206
00:11:14,961 --> 00:11:16,070
companies,
media,

207
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,160
film studios,
Youtube as et Cetera,

208
00:11:18,161 --> 00:11:18,994
et Cetera,

209
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:24,750
that

210
00:11:24,750 --> 00:11:27,900
the government could seek to become a 
logistics enclave,

211
00:11:27,901 --> 00:11:28,734
for example,
by developing its app or capabilities 

212
00:11:30,361 --> 00:11:31,194
and thus becoming a large communication 
sub for thick and attract more 

213
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:34,794
professionals from the rest of Asia.
This would allow her to both face the 

214
00:11:37,471 --> 00:11:38,304
islands aging population problem and 
also to strengthen its ties with the 

215
00:11:41,551 --> 00:11:43,530
workers,
places of origin and fifth,

216
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,030
it must continue to promote its role as 
a center for human rights and freedom of

217
00:11:48,031 --> 00:11:50,300
expression.
All right,

218
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,100
so maybe this plan is not as exciting as
just buying huge weapons,

219
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:54,934
but it would certainly be cheaper as 
trying to compete with China only via 

220
00:11:57,821 --> 00:11:58,654
the military route seems complicated and
it would boost the island's economy as 

221
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:02,524
well as give it a lot of influence 
around the world given the 

222
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,040
circumstances.
A university,

223
00:12:06,041 --> 00:12:07,570
a film studio,
a hotel,

224
00:12:07,571 --> 00:12:08,404
or the headquarters of a human rights or
multinational organization can be much 

225
00:12:12,070 --> 00:12:15,130
more important for the island survival 
than for example,

226
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,233
a battleship.
This is not about giving some ultra 

227
00:12:19,811 --> 00:12:22,270
pacifist discourse or anything like 
that.

228
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,800
It's just about pure pragmatism.

229
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:25,590
Okay.

230
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:29,190
If we're talking about guaranteeing 
Taiwan's independence and freedom,

231
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,050
this is how to do it,
but now it's your turn.

232
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,620
Do you think the international community
should guarantee Taiwan security?

233
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,513
Well,
leave your answer in the comments as
