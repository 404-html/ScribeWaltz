1
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,263
It's so good just for one week,
one week was really all the time that 

2
00:00:11,221 --> 00:00:12,054
was needed for this man.
The president of the United States stab 

3
00:00:14,721 --> 00:00:18,870
his first diplomatic crisis.
So who was this crisis with?

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:19,823
Well,
you can probably guess the answer is 

5
00:00:21,331 --> 00:00:22,950
Mexico.
Mexico.

6
00:00:22,951 --> 00:00:25,260
Mexico is the new China.
Mexico is killing us.

7
00:00:25,261 --> 00:00:28,950
The country of Mexico is killing us.
Donald trump is well,

8
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:29,843
let's say unique.
He might be the only head of state 

9
00:00:31,651 --> 00:00:34,950
capable of defying in public a foreign 
presidents in this case.

10
00:00:34,951 --> 00:00:35,950
That's opinion.
Yet though,

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:36,833
like telling him on twitter if doesn't 
travel to Washington with the idea of 

12
00:00:39,751 --> 00:00:42,480
paying for the wall,
he may as well stay at home.

13
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,180
Needless to say,
the visit never happens.

14
00:00:45,310 --> 00:00:50,310
Live Travis Mikiko,
but don't worry.

15
00:00:51,031 --> 00:00:51,864
View as we've had enough trump talk to 
the donald is not going to be the main 

16
00:00:54,961 --> 00:00:55,794
character in this video.
Today we're going to focus on the Nafta 

17
00:00:58,411 --> 00:00:59,244
agreement and especially on the 
relationship between Mexico and the 

18
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:04,973
United States of America.
Laughter is a free trade agreements 

19
00:01:09,741 --> 00:01:11,060
between the US,
Canada,

20
00:01:11,061 --> 00:01:14,540
and Mexico.
It was negotiated by President George H,

21
00:01:14,541 --> 00:01:15,374
w Bush in 1992,
and it was ratified and implemented by 

22
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,120
Bill Clinton in 1995.

23
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,023
Hey,

24
00:01:26,350 --> 00:01:30,190
Nafta has been supported both by 
Democrats and the Republicans,

25
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:32,770
but let's take a look back and analyze 
which events took place.

26
00:01:32,771 --> 00:01:34,120
South of the Bravo Riverton.

27
00:01:34,160 --> 00:01:34,993
Yeah,

28
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:38,550
let's travel back and tell him to the 19
eighties.

29
00:01:38,551 --> 00:01:41,250
It's telling.
When Mexico was exhausted,

30
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,143
the country's economic model was a worn 
out closed economy and they were in a 

31
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,950
state of crisis.
In fact,

32
00:01:46,951 --> 00:01:47,784
it was a dance hall.
Him with a massive immigration from 

33
00:01:49,471 --> 00:01:53,970
Mexico to the US started to happen and 
it wasn't just any migratory wave.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,870
It was one of the biggest migration 
waves of all time

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:10,093
and all of this happens in a time when 
Americans weren't particularly liked in 

36
00:02:13,071 --> 00:02:16,340
Mexico since the war with the US from 
easy 46 to 18,

37
00:02:16,341 --> 00:02:19,610
48 when Mexico lost more than half of 
its territory.

38
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,473
The popular sentiment in the country was
that the US was a great villain and an 

39
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:28,790
enemy that Mexico was facing by 1988.
It was clear that Mexico is closed.

40
00:02:28,791 --> 00:02:31,070
System was worn out and the president of
Mexico,

41
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:34,610
who at the time was Carlos Salinas,
a Harvard graduate by the way,

42
00:02:34,611 --> 00:02:35,444
decided to end this and opted for 
opening up Mexico to the outside world 

43
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:42,700
in his own words,
the US is not the worst threat that have

44
00:02:42,701 --> 00:02:43,534
the best opportunity and the leaders in 
North America decided they didn't want 

45
00:02:46,641 --> 00:02:49,730
to waste this chops.
They got down to business and decided to

46
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:54,140
bet on extending to Mexico a free trade 
agreements that they had recently signed

47
00:02:54,141 --> 00:02:56,870
with Canada with this.
Nafta was born.

48
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:57,763
Since then,
relations between the U S and have 

49
00:02:59,561 --> 00:03:00,394
expanded a great deal.
It is estimated the trade between the 

50
00:03:02,381 --> 00:03:06,430
two countries today exceeds half 
$8,000,000,000,000.

51
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:08,260
Now a half a trillion,
which is $500.

52
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,094
Million dollars is quite a hard number 
to get your head around in more 

53
00:03:11,831 --> 00:03:12,664
relatable terms each minute.
So that means more than a million 

54
00:03:15,101 --> 00:03:17,840
dollars worth of products crosses the 
border of the U,

55
00:03:17,841 --> 00:03:18,940
s and Mexico,

56
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:27,690
or to put it in a more international 
context,

57
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,573
trade between the US and Mexico is the 
equivalence of the Chilean economy and 

58
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,910
does more than the entire economy of 
Argentina.

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:36,110
The Gardens,
American President,

60
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:36,944
Donald Trump threatens this agreement.
Sam does even considered putting an end 

61
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:40,274
to it because according to him,
it is the worst agreements that the US 

62
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:43,664
has ever signed.
Nafta is the worst trade deal ever 

63
00:03:47,181 --> 00:03:48,014
signed anywhere,
but certainly ever signed in this 

64
00:03:49,251 --> 00:03:50,084
country.
Now that's just what he says and the 

65
00:03:51,231 --> 00:03:52,060
reality.
Well,

66
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:54,920
bits rob.
The difference after has in general been

67
00:03:54,921 --> 00:03:57,320
something of a goldmine for the United 
States.

68
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,610
It has been said that whenever trump has
a nightmare,

69
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,060
it's always the same thing he sees and 
Mexicans stealing.

70
00:04:10,061 --> 00:04:15,061
Here's what your company anyway,
we don't know if this is true bits,

71
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:16,563
probably nice,
but it would explain his obsession with 

72
00:04:18,431 --> 00:04:21,240
Mexico and also why whenever he thinks 
of Nafta,

73
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,220
he thinks of the American people getting
robbed,

74
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:27,520
but zone thing that it is only the 
president you holds in his opinion,

75
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:28,403
they need defenders of protectionism.
In the US stated that Mexican and 

76
00:04:31,451 --> 00:04:36,340
Canadian workers are causing American 
jobs to disappear because of free trade.

77
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,400
Specifically,
they claimed that imports exceed exports

78
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:41,410
by almost $80,
billion dollars,

79
00:04:41,490 --> 00:04:42,323
and that's a lot of money,
but the reality is that these figures 

80
00:04:45,221 --> 00:04:48,160
are about as reliable as a chocolate 
teapot.

81
00:04:48,190 --> 00:04:49,023
First,
there are two goods that twists those 

82
00:04:50,321 --> 00:04:52,570
numbers which have nothing to do with 
Nafta,

83
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:53,523
petrol and natural gas.
And this is really important because if 

84
00:04:56,591 --> 00:04:57,424
we don't consider those products that 
treat all that trump is talking about 

85
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,690
pretty much disappears.

86
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:10,210
Now,
some of you are probably thinking,

87
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:10,900
well,
Simon,

88
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:13,600
why wouldn't you consider petrol and 
natural gas?

89
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,310
And that's a good question.
Well,

90
00:05:15,311 --> 00:05:19,210
that's because unless trump wants to 
take the United States back to the Stone

91
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:20,043
Age,
he will have to keep getting all the 

92
00:05:21,011 --> 00:05:23,690
petrol the country needs,
whether that's from Mexico,

93
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,120
Canada,
Saudi Arabia,

94
00:05:25,180 --> 00:05:26,380
Orwell,
well anywhere else,

95
00:05:26,381 --> 00:05:28,420
but these budget figures aren't the only
ones.

96
00:05:28,421 --> 00:05:31,240
The protection is dreamers also fudged 
the biggest for.

97
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,420
They also do this by not considering 
service businesses.

98
00:05:34,421 --> 00:05:36,670
This includes things like the financial 
sector,

99
00:05:36,671 --> 00:05:38,320
the insurance sector,
traveling,

100
00:05:38,321 --> 00:05:39,490
consulting,
the Internet,

101
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,270
etc. And etc. Etc.
But ignoring these things is like sAying

102
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:46,840
the banks don't make money and the 
google simply doesn't exist.

103
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:51,310
So if we adjust these two figures,
it turns out that the us' results is not

104
00:05:51,311 --> 00:05:52,144
a deficit,
but it's actually a surplus that's true 

105
00:05:54,071 --> 00:05:55,960
for both Mexico runs,
whether it's Canada,

106
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:58,750
it's actually a surplus of more than $40
billion

107
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,643
donuts.

108
00:06:03,870 --> 00:06:04,703
The americans are really the ones who 
are making off like bandits in this 

109
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:08,880
trade relationship.
All right,

110
00:06:08,881 --> 00:06:12,030
but in mExico it's a bit different 
because even correcting the numbers,

111
00:06:12,031 --> 00:06:14,820
the us still gets the deficits in this 
relationship.

112
00:06:14,850 --> 00:06:17,670
So the question is,
what is the actual number?

113
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,900
Well,
waiver,

114
00:06:18,901 --> 00:06:19,734
it's approximately in drum roll.
Please zero point five percent of its 

115
00:06:24,361 --> 00:06:25,740
gdp.
Yes.

116
00:06:25,741 --> 00:06:28,650
I'm sorry to disappoint you.
It is really that missile.

117
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:30,630
In fact,
the deficit is actually smaller than the

118
00:06:30,631 --> 00:06:32,880
one they have with China,
Japan or Germany.

119
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:40,463
Almost all american industries export to
Mexico more than the emBossed with the 

120
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:45,024
exception of autism.

121
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,780
You can guess where the profits are 
going to end up,

122
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,673
but there is more.
It is said that the main reason for the 

123
00:07:01,451 --> 00:07:05,110
company's moving that factories to 
Mexico is because the wages are lower,

124
00:07:05,111 --> 00:07:08,950
but that's only half the truth and 
certainly isn't the main reason.

125
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,813
What's interesting about Mexico for car 
companies is that Mexico has many more 

126
00:07:13,151 --> 00:07:13,984
free trade agreements with other 
countries than the us does and this 

127
00:07:16,421 --> 00:07:17,254
allows them to produce and sell their 
cars in other markets like Brazil and 

128
00:07:19,811 --> 00:07:23,140
the european union without terrorists,
which saves them a lot of money.

129
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,930
About $700,000,000 a year.

130
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,350
Yeah.

131
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,250
The benefits of these operations getting
to end dump.

132
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,360
Yes.
Once again,

133
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:36,120
back in the pockets of the United States
of America,

134
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,990
john salon cabins with casinos.
The house always wins,

135
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,883
so thanks to Mexico.
Car companies in the usa are more 

136
00:07:43,081 --> 00:07:45,030
competitive and to have more profits.
Well,

137
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,510
consumers in America combine much 
cheaper.

138
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:51,943
All of this,
americans have more money to go to the 

139
00:07:53,421 --> 00:07:55,040
senator,
to buy clothes,

140
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:55,874
to change their small phones more often 
and take part in all that consumer 

141
00:07:58,371 --> 00:07:59,204
spending that we all love so much.
This all makes the economic wheels spin 

142
00:08:02,491 --> 00:08:03,324
them faster.

143
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:04,983
Boss

144
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,820
now probably seems to you,
yeah,

145
00:08:12,860 --> 00:08:15,230
Mexico is actually pretty important to 
the usa,

146
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,093
but imagine the other way round.
Almost 80 percent of mexican exports 

147
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,293
ends up in northern neighbor,
so it's no surprise that the threat of 

148
00:08:22,971 --> 00:08:23,804
the ends of nafta has reminded many of 
the famous quotes attributed to 

149
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:27,290
porfirio,
diaz,

150
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:28,363
Mexico.
It's so far from god and so near the 

151
00:08:30,621 --> 00:08:31,454
usa.
Nafta has been incredibly positive than 

152
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,730
Mexico.
As a quick example,

153
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,340
do you know which is the biggest 
employer in Mexico?

154
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,413
Well,
that's

155
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:42,750
unfortunately really

156
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:43,583
this huge investment by us companies 
hasn't actually given the growth that 

157
00:08:46,261 --> 00:08:48,150
was expected and for the reason for 
that,

158
00:08:48,151 --> 00:08:52,230
so we need to look at responsibility 
inside Mexico itself.

159
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,123
Now,
the truth is the mexican politicians 

160
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:54,924
don't know how to advantaGe of this 
fantastic opportunity to make Mexico 

161
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,184
more modern and more competitive,
and does he know bad politics equals 

162
00:09:02,521 --> 00:09:02,950
bad,
right

163
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:03,980
results.

164
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:12,010
All of this means that Mexico has to 
kneel in front of Donald Trump.

165
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:13,080
Well,
sesame,

166
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:13,923
not

167
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:19,470
Donald Trump,

168
00:09:19,470 --> 00:09:21,990
threatens Mexico with high tariffs on 
their products.

169
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:24,780
If they refuse to pay for the wall to be
specific,

170
00:09:24,781 --> 00:09:25,614
trump's administration is threatened.
A 20 percent tariff increase for 

171
00:09:28,621 --> 00:09:31,170
starters weld.
This would be illegal.

172
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,033
There are rules in the world trade 
organization that prevent this from 

173
00:09:34,141 --> 00:09:34,974
happening.
One of these is known as the most 

174
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,104
favored nation,
which means that one member of the wto 

175
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:41,340
cannot discriminate against another,
in fact,

176
00:09:41,341 --> 00:09:44,340
to this means that the maximum tariff 
would be limited to three percent in the

177
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,174
case that nafta were abolished.
This would be a tax for consumers and 

178
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,630
american companies and wouldn't affect 
the trade between the two nations,

179
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,493
but even if the u s with the approval of
congress were willing to ignore 

180
00:09:55,321 --> 00:09:58,950
international law,
Mexico has enough resources to fight and

181
00:09:58,951 --> 00:09:59,784
try and stop this first at Mexico would 
be able to take advantage of the 

182
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:05,790
influence of the multinational 
corporations operating in Mexico,

183
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:06,653
which could stand to lose billions of 
dollars and this is not just the 

184
00:10:09,331 --> 00:10:12,840
influence of a few rich men were talking
about all of these companies,

185
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:13,674
workers and their shareholders as well 
as millions of individual savers 

186
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:19,410
throughout the United States and the 
second reason,

187
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,310
well relations between Mexico and theu ,
s on just commercial immigration,

188
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:24,660
drug trafficking,
terrorism.

189
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:27,060
TheSe are just a few aspects of that 
relationship.

190
00:10:27,090 --> 00:10:30,030
If trump attacks economically,
Mexico could find back,

191
00:10:30,031 --> 00:10:30,864
for example,
by letting the us drown in drugs and 

192
00:10:32,881 --> 00:10:36,090
immigration waves from countries all 
across latin America.

193
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:36,953
The fact is that the u,
s and Mexico need each other more than 

194
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:40,494
it seems,
and Mexico is not seen as weak of a 

195
00:10:42,061 --> 00:10:42,894
position as trump thinks.
Although the president is in Mexico is 

196
00:10:45,301 --> 00:10:46,134
unpredictable.
It does look like he understands this 

197
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:50,040
and the message from his government is 
clear.

198
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,950
Let's talk about nafta.
We can renegotiate this treaty,

199
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:53,813
but then all these other treaties,
so we're also going to be open to 

200
00:10:55,681 --> 00:10:56,514
negotiation.
It's like this is what we think's going 

201
00:10:57,901 --> 00:10:59,490
to happen here,
a visual politic,

202
00:10:59,491 --> 00:11:02,400
and we'd love to know what you think.
Do you think Mexico should defend itself

203
00:11:02,401 --> 00:11:03,234
tooth and nail even with the risk of 
triggering a trade war with the United 

204
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:07,043
States,
or do you think the nation should be 

205
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:10,590
patient to let things go and look for a 
solution elsewhere?

206
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,453
Let us know in the comments below.
We do read them and we tried to reply 

207
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:14,843
when we can.
Don't forget that we put up brand new 

208
00:11:15,661 --> 00:11:16,494
videos every monday and thursday,
so do not forget to subscribe and as 

209
00:11:19,201 --> 00:11:20,940
always I'll see you in the next video.

210
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:22,760
I think I'm going to win the mexican 
vogue.

211
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,020
Mexico,
Mexico,

212
00:11:24,021 --> 00:11:26,410
Mexico.
We have a problem called Mexico.

213
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,280
Mexico's killing us.
Mexico's killing us.

214
00:11:28,281 --> 00:11:31,340
Mexico is the disgusting Mexico.
They're killing us.

215
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:34,650
jeff alarm,
gray pedelec.

216
00:11:34,670 --> 00:11:37,430
When I don't care if I mispronounce it 
doesn't matter.
