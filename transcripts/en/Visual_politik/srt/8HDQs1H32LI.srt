1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,480
Located in the middle of the Himalayas 
in Nepal is one of the most isolated,

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:05,970
remote and poorest countries in the 
world.

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:06,833
Traditionally,
it has been a kinds of protectorates or 

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,100
satellites country for India.
However,

5
00:00:11,101 --> 00:00:11,934
at the end of 2017,
the Communist Party of Nepal won the 

6
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:15,354
elections with an overwhelming majority 
and they've now set their sights on 

7
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:20,010
Beijing.
In this video,

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:20,903
we're going to show you what is 
happening as a bit about this country's 

9
00:00:22,921 --> 00:00:25,560
greatest hidden treasure.
So let's get into it.

10
00:00:34,280 --> 00:00:35,113
Alright,
so I've got a question for you and 

11
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:38,150
please don't Google the answer.
That would be cheating.

12
00:00:38,180 --> 00:00:39,830
Do you know which country Buddha was 
born in?

13
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,240
One,
two,

14
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:41,901
three.
Probably.

15
00:00:41,901 --> 00:00:45,230
Guess it's Nepal,
the country located in the Himalayas,

16
00:00:45,231 --> 00:00:48,350
which hosts many of the highest 
mountains in the world,

17
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,213
specifically in this country,
which covers an area about the size of 

18
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:52,424
Nicaragua.
We can find eight out of the 14 summits 

19
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:58,640
in the entire world,
the reach more than 8,000

20
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:00,230
meters,
and this includes,

21
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:05,350
of course,
Mount Everest becomes very also boasts a

22
00:01:09,791 --> 00:01:13,750
total of 240 pigs that reach higher than
6,000

23
00:01:13,751 --> 00:01:14,790
meters.
In other words,

24
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,670
Nepal is a absolute paradise for people 
who love mountains,

25
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:20,830
and by the way Katmandu,
it's capital ends,

26
00:01:20,831 --> 00:01:24,450
the largest city in the Himalayas is 
also one of backpack.

27
00:01:24,451 --> 00:01:27,310
His favorite cities on the planet and 
well,

28
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,173
why is that?

29
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:29,603
Yes,

30
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,493
well,
maybe it does something to do with the 

31
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:37,970
fact that this city is full of temples,
pagodas and Ali's full of life,

32
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,920
like hobbies or were in the 21st 
century.

33
00:01:39,921 --> 00:01:42,350
You won't be able to find skyscrapers 
wide avenues,

34
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:45,710
modern buses or practically any luxury 
franchise.

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,793
Yes,

36
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:49,641
it's pretty cool,
right?

37
00:01:49,641 --> 00:01:53,920
Like one of those last drops of history 
in a totally modern and global world.

38
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,780
Well,
as wonderful as it sounds for a visit,

39
00:01:56,781 --> 00:02:00,860
the reality is that Nepal is one of the 
poorest countries in the world.

40
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,370
According to the United Nations.
Nepal is one of the Asian countries with

41
00:02:04,371 --> 00:02:05,204
the worst human development index.
Scores in Nepal comes in at 144th in 

42
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,440
that ranking bands.
I'll be honest,

43
00:02:12,441 --> 00:02:17,441
this isn't really surprising.
See,

44
00:02:18,331 --> 00:02:20,970
despite having almost 30 million 
inhabitants,

45
00:02:20,971 --> 00:02:21,804
it's economy is smaller than that of 
Bolivia whose population belly exceeds 

46
00:02:25,411 --> 00:02:28,770
10 million people.
That means that in per capita terms,

47
00:02:28,771 --> 00:02:32,160
Bolivia is three times richer than 
Nepal.

48
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,640
That's why with everyday that passes 
1,500

49
00:02:39,641 --> 00:02:42,190
people move abroad,
1,500

50
00:02:42,191 --> 00:02:43,230
people.
And if you are,

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,370
this has not made it easy for the 
Nepalese.

52
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,810
Do you want to know why?
Well,

53
00:02:46,811 --> 00:02:51,811
listen up dominated country.

54
00:02:56,570 --> 00:02:57,660
Yeah.

55
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,373
The political system has been anchored 
in the past until practically the day 

56
00:03:03,771 --> 00:03:08,771
before yesterday in 2008.
Nepal was an absolute monarchy under the

57
00:03:08,931 --> 00:03:11,570
exclusive control of the king and by the
way,

58
00:03:11,571 --> 00:03:12,404
fun little tidbit of knowledge right now
despite being the birth place of butter 

59
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,610
itself,
until 2006,

60
00:03:16,611 --> 00:03:18,670
this was the only country in the world 
were hidden.

61
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:19,543
Do Islam was the official religion,
but also leave that between 1996 and 

62
00:03:23,541 --> 00:03:26,030
2006.
The country suffered through a civil war

63
00:03:26,031 --> 00:03:28,220
between governments or forces,
the monarchy,

64
00:03:28,221 --> 00:03:29,054
dictatorship forces and the Maoist 
rebels who supported the establishment 

65
00:03:32,780 --> 00:03:36,530
of a communist republic.
Yes.

66
00:03:36,531 --> 00:03:38,330
You heard that right?
Monarchy,

67
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:43,350
civil war Maoism probably can understand
now why this country is quite so poor.

68
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,380
There has been such a huge amounts of 
chaos in the last 30 years,

69
00:03:47,381 --> 00:03:52,381
but the average life expectancy of a 
government was wait for it one year.

70
00:03:57,430 --> 00:04:00,020
You have you.
That is certainly not everything.

71
00:04:00,021 --> 00:04:03,230
Nepal has another characteristic that is
greatly conditioned.

72
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:07,140
It's political and economic situation.
See as you probably known,

73
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:07,983
Nepal has no coast and have you noticed 
too all that only neighbors exactly in 

74
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,263
Nepal is stuck between two giants 
between the two most probable future 

75
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:21,570
great powers of this century.
Of course,

76
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,510
that's India and that's China to 
countries that Maura,

77
00:04:24,511 --> 00:04:25,344
that don't exactly get on very well as 
we have seen previously on visual 

78
00:04:29,341 --> 00:04:30,174
politic.

79
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,733
Yes,
we could say that both China and India 

80
00:04:34,361 --> 00:04:38,410
are in the forefront of Nepal's.
Ministry of Foreign Affairs mind.

81
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:40,060
Well,
the fact is that traditionally,

82
00:04:40,061 --> 00:04:40,894
and largely thanks to the geography that
favors at Nepal has been kind of a 

83
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,673
satellite country for India,
something the New Delhi government has 

84
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:49,770
always been very,
very clear about

85
00:04:51,210 --> 00:04:52,043
wants to micromanage Nepal.
They have to control all government 

86
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:55,600
appointments.
They have to know everything.

87
00:04:55,660 --> 00:04:57,610
They're ambassadors behave like 
viceroys,

88
00:04:57,670 --> 00:04:58,900
aren't we?
A sovereign nation,

89
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,100
Kishore Shrestha,
editor of Jonah Asta National Weekly and

90
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,200
a board member of Nepal's press council.

91
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:06,083
Perhaps the best proof of how India has 
always wanted to control this remote 

92
00:05:08,671 --> 00:05:11,640
countries.
Destiny happens in 2015,

93
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,233
but that's the only political forces 
were designing the constitution of the 

94
00:05:23,831 --> 00:05:27,100
newly created Democratic Federal 
Republic of the poll.

95
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:27,963
Well,
New Delhi demanded that Nepal create a 

96
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,034
separate province for people of Indian 
descent who were living in the terrain 

97
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,930
planes say region in southern Nepal on 
the border with.

98
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,913
Yeah.

99
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:44,630
This was something that the Nepalese 
political forces emphatically opposed.

100
00:05:44,660 --> 00:05:45,493
They wouldn't established political 
separations based on identity under any 

101
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:50,720
circumstances.
Well,

102
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:53,150
when New Delhi didn't get an affirmative
answer,

103
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,010
what do you think they did?
Well,

104
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:58,820
they blocked the borders.
Now it was all but provision trucks,

105
00:05:58,821 --> 00:06:00,230
they just stopped crossing.
Now,

106
00:06:00,231 --> 00:06:01,550
this would have been bad,
really,

107
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:04,460
really bad under any circumstances,
but on top of all of that,

108
00:06:04,461 --> 00:06:07,310
this blockade happens when the country 
was at its worst,

109
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:08,173
it adjusts,
suffered a huge wake quake that caused 

110
00:06:10,490 --> 00:06:14,540
enormous damage.
The deadly's seven point eight magnitude

111
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,310
earthquake struck Nepal in 2015 and 
killed thousands of people so powerful.

112
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,144
It moved Mount Everest is he not want.
This hasn't been the only blockade or 

113
00:06:23,841 --> 00:06:24,674
the only strategy that India is used to 
pressure the Nepalese politicians to 

114
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,203
follow their advice offer.
All trade with India has traditionally 

115
00:06:32,571 --> 00:06:36,470
accounted for almost three quarters of 
all Napoli's trade,

116
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,120
the now after centuries of absolute 
monarchy and decades of war and chaos.

117
00:06:46,121 --> 00:06:46,954
Things are finally beginning to 
normalize in the polk and democracy is 

118
00:06:50,051 --> 00:06:50,884
gaining strength and also China's doors 
that are getting to open China's 

119
00:07:00,881 --> 00:07:01,714
arrival.

120
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,893
Okay?

121
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:08,700
China and Nepal share a 1,400
kilometer border and in recent years,

122
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:11,430
this border,
it's become quite fashionable.

123
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,323
Commercial relations between both 
countries have tripled since 2010 China 

124
00:07:15,961 --> 00:07:17,070
results.
It becomes the country.

125
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:17,963
This invests the most money every year 
in Nepal and tourism coming from the 

126
00:07:21,391 --> 00:07:25,980
great Asian power is growing rapidly in 
the last 10 years alone,

127
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:26,814
despite the earthquake,
the number of Chinese tourists arriving 

128
00:07:28,771 --> 00:07:31,690
into poll every year has multiplied by 
four

129
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:35,870
present trying to depaul relations are 
developing at the fastest pace.

130
00:07:35,871 --> 00:07:38,960
We've seen you home Chinese ambassador 
in Nepal.

131
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:42,560
That's how relations between Nepal and 
China are growing.

132
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:44,333
Hydro power to cement Chinese businesses
are already all around this small South 

133
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:48,823
Asian country.
Chinese Internet providers are breaking 

134
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:52,940
Indian monopoly.
Chinese tourists are flooding Nepal.

135
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:53,833
Chinese language institutions are 
mushrooming more Nepali students are 

136
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:57,014
traveling to China and to India and 
hundreds of Nepali officers are invited 

137
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:05,381
to China every year as part of an 
unprecedented charm offensive that's not

138
00:08:05,621 --> 00:08:06,454
all.
At the end of 2017 elections were held 

139
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,270
to elect a new parliaments and two brand
new government.

140
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:19,823
The communist party's victory was 
overwhelming and this is a communist 

141
00:08:22,531 --> 00:08:25,560
party.
Very much influenced by Beijing.

142
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:26,453
Now the new prime minister Cardigan 
really has boosted relations with its 

143
00:08:29,461 --> 00:08:31,530
northern neighbor to grow trade and 
investments,

144
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,393
but also to gain independence from India
because it's number one priority and 

145
00:08:36,061 --> 00:08:36,894
folks,
Beijing clearly doesn't want to miss 

146
00:08:38,671 --> 00:08:39,990
this opportunity.
Therefore,

147
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:40,853
Beijing is putting huge projects on the 
table to change the whole situation 

148
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,390
forever.
Roads,

149
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:46,890
airports,
and the bubble,

150
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:48,800
the promise of a new railway line.

151
00:08:49,690 --> 00:08:54,690
Appreciate because sign up with a other 
fields.

152
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,493
For example,
the Chinese government has announced 

153
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:09,414
that is looking into extending the 
railway that connects to best with the 

154
00:09:11,761 --> 00:09:12,594
eastern coast all the way to the 
Nepalese border and there is little 

155
00:09:15,361 --> 00:09:16,194
doubt that China would have no problem 
financing the railways construction all 

156
00:09:19,651 --> 00:09:21,480
the way to cat.
Man Do.

157
00:09:22,820 --> 00:09:23,340
Okay.

158
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,173
By the way,
we already know talking about a small 

159
00:09:25,591 --> 00:09:27,420
project APP,
connecting Napoleon.

160
00:09:27,421 --> 00:09:31,680
China by rail could mean multiplying the
arrival of Chinese tourists by 10,

161
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:32,514
15 or even 20 times.
And if the train in addition was 

162
00:09:35,641 --> 00:09:36,474
connected to the Indian railway network,
we could be speaking of a revolution in 

163
00:09:39,841 --> 00:09:42,450
transporting merchandise between the 
two.

164
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,480
Great giant.
If we can connect this railway network,

165
00:09:48,890 --> 00:09:49,723
our east West Rail project,
it can revolutionize trying to India 

166
00:09:52,271 --> 00:09:55,000
trade with Nepal in the Middle Cod,
God prawsaud,

167
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,343
Prime Minister of Nepal.
Of course the new government doesn't 

168
00:09:58,211 --> 00:09:59,044
intend to break ties with India,
but it looks like Nepal has stopped 

169
00:10:01,391 --> 00:10:02,224
being New Delhi subordinates and most 
importantly for the first time it looks 

170
00:10:05,381 --> 00:10:08,980
like this country has a clear option for
a better future.

171
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,070
You want to know our well,
listen up future water and mountains.

172
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:22,620
Nepal is one of the poorest countries in
the world,

173
00:10:22,621 --> 00:10:25,140
but it doesn't have to continue to be 
so.

174
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,093
Allow me to explain.
On the one hand in Nepal is a country 

175
00:10:27,661 --> 00:10:28,800
with nature,
mountains,

176
00:10:28,801 --> 00:10:31,380
exotic landscapes,
and an impressive gastronomy.

177
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,273
I mean,
there's no secret that it's tourism 

178
00:10:33,181 --> 00:10:34,014
potential is absolutely huge,
especially if communications with China 

179
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:40,320
improve and just we've seen that's 
pretty damn likely to happen.

180
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,570
I mean,
who would not like to visit Nepal?

181
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:52,690
It's not all in fact,
far from it.

182
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:55,750
The Paul's great hidden treasure is 
actually water.

183
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:04,560
Yep.

184
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,100
You heard that right?
It's really water as we've already seen.

185
00:11:08,190 --> 00:11:09,023
The pool has huge mountains and steep 
valleys that have been carved by large 

186
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,450
rivets and what can be done with all of 
this natural wealth.

187
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,313
Wow.
Studies conducted by the Nepalese 

188
00:11:19,151 --> 00:11:19,984
government and show them the pools of 
underwater resources can produce huge 

189
00:11:23,081 --> 00:11:26,320
amounts of hydroelectric power at a very
low cost.

190
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:27,183
Basically it's potential power 
generation capacity could be almost 50 

191
00:11:29,651 --> 00:11:30,484
percent,
half of all the hydro power that is 

192
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:34,540
produced within the United States,

193
00:11:37,060 --> 00:11:37,740
and

194
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,750
that is a lot of electricity.
Now,

195
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:43,810
let's not forget,
Nepal is located between India and China

196
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:44,773
and very close to Bangladesh.
These all three fast growing economies 

197
00:11:48,221 --> 00:11:53,221
whose electricity consumption is 
absolutely soaring and the pool,

198
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,233
while that may have the capacity to 
supply them with the cheapest 

199
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:59,200
electricity of all.
Now,

200
00:11:59,201 --> 00:12:01,960
of course so far,
none of this has been exploited,

201
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,823
but everything indicates that this 
abandonments can be left behind very 

202
00:12:06,221 --> 00:12:08,230
quickly.
If the country regain stability,

203
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:12,490
investors will line up to finance and 
develop this kind of project.

204
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:15,670
The only resource we have,
like the Arabian countries,

205
00:12:15,671 --> 00:12:19,540
have oil is water chubby guy or project 
manager at the rush of what God.

206
00:12:19,541 --> 00:12:20,374
The hydroelectric project,
a 111 megawatt plant under construction 

207
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:27,040
near China's border and the potential it
doesn't end there.

208
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:27,933
Nepal's new closeness to China could 
make Chinese money Russians to the 

209
00:12:30,821 --> 00:12:34,210
country in order to finance large 
hydroelectric plants.

210
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,073
Well,
that's precisely what the Nepalese 

211
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:36,994
government is thinking.
Depaul's new communist prime minister 

212
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:41,223
will restart a Chinese led two point $5,
billion US dollar hydropower project 

213
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:47,590
that was pulled by the previous 
government,

214
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:49,660
considered friendly towards India.
Anyway,

215
00:12:49,661 --> 00:12:52,630
the situation now is that the pool is 
still a very poor country,

216
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:55,840
but with new policies it could stop 
being so.

217
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:56,733
So will the new government,
the able to leave its ideological 

218
00:12:59,051 --> 00:13:01,270
inclinations behind and bet on 
stability,

219
00:13:01,330 --> 00:13:03,340
openness and foreign investments?
Well,

220
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,530
only time will tell,
but now it's your turn.

221
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,433
Do you think that Nepal should bet on 
China or should it continue to 

222
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,170
strengthen ties with India?
Well,

223
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,033
