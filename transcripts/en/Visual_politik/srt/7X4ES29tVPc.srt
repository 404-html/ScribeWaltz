1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible]

2
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:09,883
how many people?
Japan is still pretty mysterious and 

3
00:00:11,961 --> 00:00:12,794
that's not only because it's a country 
where people push that dog's arounds in 

4
00:00:15,741 --> 00:00:19,310
prams and drink coffee in places full of
cats mode at all.

5
00:00:19,311 --> 00:00:20,144
In fact,
just like being an overpopulated area 

6
00:00:23,511 --> 00:00:24,344
with scarce natural resources,
Japan is one of the richest and most 

7
00:00:26,811 --> 00:00:27,644
developed countries in the world with 
the highest average life expectancy on 

8
00:00:31,161 --> 00:00:31,630
the planet.

9
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:32,463
It's

10
00:00:34,490 --> 00:00:37,400
so,
it's no wonder that it tends to amaze us

11
00:00:37,401 --> 00:00:38,720
in the west,
but hold on.

12
00:00:38,721 --> 00:00:39,554
Amendments here because Japan wasn't 
always the economic powerhouse that we 

13
00:00:42,381 --> 00:00:43,820
know today.
In fact,

14
00:00:43,821 --> 00:00:46,190
it was quite the opposite until the mid 
19th century.

15
00:00:46,191 --> 00:00:47,024
This country operated under a political 
and economic system that was very 

16
00:00:50,061 --> 00:00:52,770
similar to medieval a Europe's at that 
time,

17
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,663
Japan was a poor and backward territory,
closed off to the world with a strongly 

18
00:00:57,381 --> 00:00:59,540
stratified society.
Now the question is,

19
00:00:59,541 --> 00:01:00,374
how did the great change occur?
How did Japan managed to her eyes up 

20
00:01:03,471 --> 00:01:08,300
from its status as a poor rural country 
to that of a great industrial power?

21
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,253
Was it all because of the influence and 
help of the United States after the 

22
00:01:14,961 --> 00:01:15,794
Second World War?
Was it the result of a meticulously 

23
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:19,790
designed the plan by the government?
Well,

24
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:24,110
we can say that this entire process 
involved to major stages.

25
00:01:24,111 --> 00:01:26,150
We'll talk about the first one in this 
video,

26
00:01:26,151 --> 00:01:30,860
which began 150 years ago with these so 
called Meiji Restoration and yes,

27
00:01:30,861 --> 00:01:31,694
this did happen 150 years ago.
2018 is the hundred 50th anniversary of 

28
00:01:35,391 --> 00:01:36,800
this happening.
The second stage,

29
00:01:36,801 --> 00:01:38,600
which we're going to talk about in a 
future video,

30
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,434
and don't forget to subscribe,
so you get that began at the end of the 

31
00:01:42,051 --> 00:01:44,420
Second World War.
But having said this,

32
00:01:44,421 --> 00:01:46,760
let's stop with the story.
So here we go.

33
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:54,223
Meiji restoration 150 years ago,
the Meiji Restoration of 1868 and did 

34
00:02:00,331 --> 00:02:01,164
the dominance of the Tokugawa,
a clan of it for more than 250 years in 

35
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,970
1603 and virtually supplanters of the 
emperor's power,

36
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,820
turning them into the great lords of 
Japan.

37
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:14,343
We're talking about a long period during
which Japan remained isolated from all 

38
00:02:18,011 --> 00:02:18,844
contact with the outside world and well 
many western countries were throwing 

39
00:02:22,061 --> 00:02:24,040
themselves into the industrial 
revolution.

40
00:02:24,041 --> 00:02:26,920
This isolation calls Japan to retain 
social,

41
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:27,843
political,
and economic structures that were more 

42
00:02:29,681 --> 00:02:32,620
similar to the Middle Ages than modern 
times.

43
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:34,750
At that time,
Japan was a feudal society,

44
00:02:34,751 --> 00:02:38,770
dominated by warlords.
Zenned for no less than 14 centuries had

45
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:42,550
behaved like a kind of vassal state of 
the Chinese emba.

46
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:44,973
All of this very,
very different from the Japan that we 

47
00:02:46,661 --> 00:02:47,494
know today.
We're talking about a country that 

48
00:02:48,821 --> 00:02:49,654
prohibited the use of its ports by 
foreigners to stop their interference 

49
00:02:52,601 --> 00:02:55,510
from contaminating the local culture and
traditions.

50
00:02:55,630 --> 00:02:56,463
Of course,
that also ended any trade and any 

51
00:02:58,031 --> 00:03:02,230
possibility that it's political estates 
would move to the beat of the Times.

52
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,153
This was the situation until in 1853 a 
modern u s fleet arrived in Tokyo Bay 

53
00:03:07,871 --> 00:03:11,940
with a mission and a message.
Either the Japanese authorities excepted

54
00:03:11,941 --> 00:03:16,941
ends allow trade or that half to face 
the consequences steamboats the hawks of

55
00:03:24,561 --> 00:03:25,394
the Pacific break their rest.
Four boats are enough to make us lose 

56
00:03:28,731 --> 00:03:29,450
sleep.
At night.

57
00:03:29,450 --> 00:03:30,283
Japanese poem referring to the American 
ships that arrived in the country in 

58
00:03:33,681 --> 00:03:38,681
1853 obviously the fall less developed 
Japanese institutions could do little in

59
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:42,440
the face of a modern technologically 
advanced war fleet,

60
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:45,710
so they had no choice but to accept and 
it

61
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:52,540
that was the beginning of the end of the
Tokugawa regime within a few years,

62
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:53,374
disgusted by the morven palpable loss of
sovereignty by the humiliation of 

63
00:03:56,801 --> 00:03:59,110
feeling like a poor and and capable of 
country,

64
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:01,540
and having seen the decline of the 
Chinese Empire,

65
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,433
the Samurai Samurai,
which by the way were much more modern 

66
00:04:04,601 --> 00:04:05,434
than those we usually see in movies,
took control and they restored imperial 

67
00:04:08,891 --> 00:04:12,130
Japan.
We're talking about the well known Meiji

68
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:12,963
Restoration,
which against all odds launched Japan 

69
00:04:14,021 --> 00:04:19,021
into the arms of a broad reform program 
that changed practically every field off

70
00:04:21,290 --> 00:04:23,650
to rule given the enormous 
technological,

71
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:26,710
economic and military superiority of the
western powers.

72
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:27,613
The best way to preserve Japan 
sovereignty equals to take notes and to 

73
00:04:30,251 --> 00:04:35,220
promote the country's development.
I do.

74
00:04:35,221 --> 00:04:36,054
You know what?
While they did just that within a few 

75
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:38,493
years,
not even the Japanese themselves could 

76
00:04:39,941 --> 00:04:40,774
recognize Japan.
These are the steps of the country 

77
00:04:42,461 --> 00:04:46,270
followed to jump from the feudal age 
right into the modern world.

78
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:47,133
So listen up

79
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:50,413
at the political level,
many of the old institutions were 

80
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:54,640
terminated and an independent judiciary 
power,

81
00:04:54,641 --> 00:04:55,474
a bicameral legislature and a modern 
prefectural system were introduced to 

82
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:01,150
govern the countries,
various regions.

83
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:04,720
The old taxes on the sale of rice were 
replaced by a lamb's tax,

84
00:05:04,721 --> 00:05:07,600
which had two huge advantages.
First,

85
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:08,434
it facilitated the calculation of the 
revenues the government obtained each 

86
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,240
year after all,
nick amounts of lands doesn't change,

87
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,340
but the rice production does change 
every year,

88
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,140
which allowed the government to,
for example,

89
00:05:17,141 --> 00:05:20,740
design finance and build several 
infrastructure projects.

90
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,633
This then help the time and lands 
ownership with precision establishing a 

91
00:05:24,491 --> 00:05:26,310
modern property rights system for it.
Yeah,

92
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:30,553
well that was not all being aware of the
importance of knowledge and new 

93
00:05:33,151 --> 00:05:37,410
technologies in 1872 just four years 
after the Meiji Restoration,

94
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,273
the Japanese government to establish a 
universal primary education system 

95
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:42,433
because within a few years the Tokyo 
Institute of Technology and the 

96
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:46,883
University of Tokyo were create it.
And of course in addition to everything 

97
00:05:49,411 --> 00:05:51,960
we've seen,
Japan is openness was also encouraged.

98
00:05:51,961 --> 00:05:52,794
Foreign experts and professionals we 
have attracted to transmit their 

99
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:55,854
knowledge and many Japanese students 
were scholarships to study both in 

100
00:05:58,970 --> 00:05:59,803
Europe and in the United States.
The results of this whole process was 

101
00:06:06,841 --> 00:06:07,674
that in just 50 years Japan managed to 
go through it's own industrial 

102
00:06:11,431 --> 00:06:12,264
revolution.
That's one third of the time it took 

103
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,253
Europe

104
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:17,923
that way.
In the following decades Japan 

105
00:06:19,101 --> 00:06:19,934
continued.
It's take off process and completely 

106
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:22,754
changed and that's also when it began 
extending its influenced up neighboring 

107
00:06:25,641 --> 00:06:27,380
countries like Korea,
China,

108
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:28,273
Russia and Taiwan in 1902 cause they 
also signed a friendship agreement with 

109
00:06:31,101 --> 00:06:34,370
Great Britain and agreements.
And this not only boosted its industry,

110
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:35,204
but when World War One arrived,
it enabled Japan to become an important 

111
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,800
supplier,
further boosting its economy.

112
00:06:39,860 --> 00:06:40,693
In these years,
many Japanese entrepreneurs became 

113
00:06:42,621 --> 00:06:47,520
million ads for one reason or another.
In the ends,

114
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:51,160
when countries boost their trade,
every party usually benefits.

115
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:51,821
Mr.
Trump.

116
00:06:51,821 --> 00:06:53,500
Take note here,
but folks,

117
00:06:53,501 --> 00:06:54,334
that's how we got to the year 1926 the 
year when the darkest time in Japan 

118
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,423
began.

119
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:06,450
Nope.

120
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:11,450
War Economy,
1926 the,

121
00:07:11,611 --> 00:07:12,444
yeah,
that's Emperor Hirohito ascended the 

122
00:07:13,651 --> 00:07:18,651
throne where he remained all the way 
until 1989 and from that exact moment in

123
00:07:19,111 --> 00:07:23,430
the 1920s Japan began to deepen its most
warlike profile.

124
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,810
In 1931 Japanese troops occupied the 
Chinese province of Manchuria where they

125
00:07:27,811 --> 00:07:30,510
not only committed and enormous number 
of crimes,

126
00:07:30,511 --> 00:07:31,344
but in occupying the province,
they also triggered the tense relations 

127
00:07:34,081 --> 00:07:36,690
between Japan and most of the western 
powers.

128
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,630
And that's not once everything he said 
came to power,

129
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:42,523
the government again,
to boost the war industry to such an 

130
00:07:44,331 --> 00:07:45,164
extent that in 1931 while the trips 
invaded Manchuria Japanese government 

131
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:53,030
authorized and encouraged the creation 
of cartels among large companies,

132
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:53,923
especially among the heavy industry.
That is to say the industry related to 

133
00:07:57,231 --> 00:07:59,990
steel boat machinery,
truck construction,

134
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:01,093
et cetera.
That way the government is good urge 

135
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,194
launch companies do agreeing to increase
production as quickly as possible if 

136
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:08,090
while limiting the entry of new 
competitors,

137
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,210
and that's not all in the following 
years.

138
00:08:13,211 --> 00:08:14,044
The government also injected a lot of 
capital into these companies until it 

139
00:08:16,991 --> 00:08:20,410
became co owner of several of them.
All the while our military spending,

140
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:25,440
it just wouldn't stop growing.
Of course,

141
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,350
this massive amounts of government 
intervention in the economy,

142
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:29,243
they had had consequences.
It's more businesses were ravaged and 

143
00:08:31,411 --> 00:08:35,940
almost every civilian industry closed 
long before the U s bombing during World

144
00:08:35,941 --> 00:08:36,774
War Two the consequences of this war 
economy didn't only lead to a more 

145
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:42,600
authoritarian governments since a 
greater military influence,

146
00:08:42,601 --> 00:08:43,434
which ultimately ended up in a war,
but also in the general impoverishment 

147
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,633
of the Japanese.

148
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,763
Yes.

149
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,091
Now,
of course,

150
00:08:53,091 --> 00:08:53,924
military material had to be produced of 
goods that would improve people's lives 

151
00:08:57,241 --> 00:08:59,100
on a day to day basis.
More rifles,

152
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,990
less soon machines ended up with the 
country being much poorer in the end.

153
00:09:08,290 --> 00:09:10,270
You know what?
It's not strange at all.

154
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,133
History teaches us that militaristic 
policies tend to be very efficient and 

155
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:16,220
boost the power of the elite.
Well,

156
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:20,500
impoverishing the majority.
The fact is that as we all know,

157
00:09:20,501 --> 00:09:23,740
at the end of World War Two Japan wasn't
only a defeated country,

158
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:24,603
the Japanese economy,
it was shattered and the Japanese had 

159
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:30,060
gone back decades in terms of their 
standard.

160
00:09:30,061 --> 00:09:30,260
Yeah.

161
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,093
Living

162
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,500
all this,
of course,

163
00:09:33,501 --> 00:09:34,334
in addition to the tragedy of having 
lost more than 3 million lives during 

164
00:09:37,401 --> 00:09:38,234
the conflicts,

165
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,210
nope.

166
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,220
Some of you may be wondering,
well,

167
00:09:42,221 --> 00:09:43,054
what happens after the war?
How did Japan managed to become such a 

168
00:09:45,491 --> 00:09:47,920
great power within just a few years?
Well,

169
00:09:47,921 --> 00:09:50,050
folks,
we're going to get into those answers in

170
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:53,740
a future video here on visual politics.
So far in this one,

171
00:09:53,741 --> 00:09:57,430
we've already seen how Japan made the 
great leap and went from the Middle Ages

172
00:09:57,550 --> 00:10:00,040
to the modern wells,
and in the future we're going to explore

173
00:10:00,041 --> 00:10:02,350
even more.
So I really hope you enjoy this video.
