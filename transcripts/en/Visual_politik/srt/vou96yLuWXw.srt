1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,280
one of the most surprising things about 
Japan,

3
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:14,750
and there are many surprising things is 
quite how safe it is.

4
00:00:14,751 --> 00:00:15,584
[inaudible] Japan is one of the few 
countries in the world where you can 

5
00:00:17,611 --> 00:00:21,090
leave an iphone 10 and a coffee shop and
the only thing you've got to worry about

6
00:00:21,120 --> 00:00:21,953
is dropping by the next day to get it.
Because to view it is only certain that 

7
00:00:25,111 --> 00:00:25,944
your recently released brand new iphone 
10 will be there waiting for you at the 

8
00:00:29,031 --> 00:00:29,300
next

9
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:30,133
stay.

10
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:35,630
I'm not even exaggerating here.
Also,

11
00:00:35,631 --> 00:00:36,464
Japan is a beautiful country with 
amazing sites where everything seems to 

12
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:44,681
be exactly where it should be.
As you know,

13
00:00:49,811 --> 00:00:54,000
this is not a travel channel in this 
video is indeed not sponsored by Japan's

14
00:00:54,001 --> 00:00:57,330
Ministry of Tourism.
So let us get right to the point yet.

15
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:05,350
Recently we will find out that emperor 
hito has decided to abdicate.

16
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,670
The Emperor of Japan will step down on 
April 30th,

17
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:13,180
2019 the first application by a Japanese
monarch in two centuries.

18
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:13,871
Well,
see,

19
00:01:13,871 --> 00:01:18,871
this emperor came to the throne almost 
30 years ago in 1989 just when the great

20
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:22,430
Japanese crisis again.
So No.

21
00:01:22,460 --> 00:01:24,130
In Japan,
the emperor has no power.

22
00:01:24,131 --> 00:01:27,220
So I can hito wasn't responsible,
but don't say that.

23
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:28,054
Can't be just coincidence and bad luck.
We can practically say that it was off 

24
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:34,960
to Iquitos arrival that 30 years of 
stagnation began,

25
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,550
and in this video we're going to see 
what happens,

26
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:40,510
what caused this great crisis and why 
the German economic model has managed to

27
00:01:40,511 --> 00:01:42,430
defeat the Japanese model.
But first,

28
00:01:42,431 --> 00:01:44,530
have you or let's have a small history.
Lesson.

29
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:51,213
Goals exists and Germany are two very 
interesting countries with a lot in 

30
00:01:57,801 --> 00:01:58,634
common,
and it's also many differences off to 

31
00:02:00,321 --> 00:02:03,380
the Second World War.
Both countries were literally in ruins.

32
00:02:03,381 --> 00:02:05,240
They had lost not only the 
infrastructure,

33
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,050
but also an entire generation.
However,

34
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:09,943
despite this,
between the 1950s in the 1970s both 

35
00:02:12,111 --> 00:02:12,944
countries experienced such a powerful 
take off that in those two decades they 

36
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,114
not only managed to recover bus become 
two of the largest economies in the 

37
00:02:20,961 --> 00:02:23,180
world as well as two of the richest 
country.

38
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,170
In fact,
even though it might seem incredible,

39
00:02:27,171 --> 00:02:28,004
it's a day for years,
it was speculated that Japan could 

40
00:02:29,781 --> 00:02:34,280
surpass even the United States as the 
world's largest economy and oh,

41
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,114
how things have changed says that 
between 1955 and 1973 Japan grew at an 

42
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:47,260
average rate of 9% a year and between 
1973 and 1990 above 4% these are really,

43
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,443
truly incredible rates and Germany 
didn't stay behind just as an average 

44
00:02:52,941 --> 00:02:55,580
growth rate of 7% for almost 30 years.

45
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:58,100
Countries

46
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:00,790
where at full throttle,
their factories works tirelessly.

47
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,624
There was no unemployment and it's both 
Germans and the Japanese saved and 

48
00:03:04,841 --> 00:03:05,674
invested their money all over the world.
Suddenly Japanese and German companies 

49
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:14,101
became famous.
World was very important,

50
00:03:17,251 --> 00:03:18,084
especially for Japan,
a country that lives constantly under 

51
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,393
nature's threat.

52
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,070
Sorry,

53
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:23,903
it's being a very mountainous country.
Japan suffers from all kinds of natural 

54
00:03:26,791 --> 00:03:27,900
disasters,
earthquakes,

55
00:03:27,901 --> 00:03:29,500
cyclin tsunamis,
et Cetera,

56
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:30,590
et Cetera,
et cetera.

57
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,663
Bye Bye.

In a future visual politic video,
hit subscribe.

59
00:03:35,431 --> 00:03:36,264
Wait,
going to tell you all about how these 

60
00:03:37,141 --> 00:03:42,141
two economic miracles took place.
Well.

61
00:03:44,271 --> 00:03:48,410
The fact is that in 1989 this entire 
economic takeoff stops.

62
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:49,303
It came to an end and gave way to what 
is known as the great Japanese 

63
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,350
stagnation.
Forget Greece.

64
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:56,370
Japan has the world's real economic 
time.

65
00:03:56,371 --> 00:03:58,790
Buck Christopher Matthews,
an axios reporter.

66
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,743
I'm pretty convinced this isn't news to 
you as it isn't strange to hear people 

67
00:04:02,631 --> 00:04:05,180
talk about Japan along with the word 
crisis.

68
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,633
Since I can recall,
Japan has been the country of eternal 

69
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:11,124
crisis,
the country that has one good year for 

70
00:04:12,841 --> 00:04:14,660
every three bad ones.
In fact,

71
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,503
nowadays we can easily declared Germany 
v winner in the growth rates that both 

72
00:04:18,751 --> 00:04:23,751
countries maintained for decades today.
Germany,

73
00:04:26,521 --> 00:04:29,220
which has also gone through some bad 
times in recent decades,

74
00:04:29,221 --> 00:04:31,200
is richer,
has healthier public accounts,

75
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,760
is more competitive internationally and 
has higher weight.

76
00:04:33,761 --> 00:04:34,594
Yeah.

77
00:04:34,890 --> 00:04:35,723
Yes.

78
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:36,573
No idea of Japan situation.
I think we can use to very revealing 

79
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:41,410
facts first in Japan,
real wages,

80
00:04:41,411 --> 00:04:44,620
which take into account inflation are 
lower today than salaries.

81
00:04:44,621 --> 00:04:48,340
Back in 1990 which was 30 years ago,
seconds,

82
00:04:48,341 --> 00:04:51,550
the Japanese government's public debt is
the highest in the world.

83
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:54,580
250% of GDP.
Yes,

84
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,830
we didn't screw that up.
That is really the debt.

85
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,690
So do you feel,
you might be wondering,

86
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,533
well what the hell happens?
What made the German models so much 

87
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,620
better than the Japanese?
Well,

88
00:05:07,621 --> 00:05:11,940
obviously there are lots of reasons,
but we believe that three of them are by

89
00:05:11,941 --> 00:05:14,400
far the most important.
So we're going to take a look at them,

90
00:05:14,401 --> 00:05:14,610
right?

91
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:15,443
No

92
00:05:20,590 --> 00:05:21,840
problematic model.

93
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,503
Okay.

94
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,620
First we can save that.
There was a big difference between Japan

95
00:05:27,621 --> 00:05:28,454
and Japanese developments,
the country of the rising sun opposite 

96
00:05:30,561 --> 00:05:33,710
to protect a large industrial 
conglomerates of [inaudible].

97
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:35,300
They can read,
so to speak,

98
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:37,520
holdings the do practically everything 
that is,

99
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:39,650
they have companies for all kinds of 
things,

100
00:05:39,651 --> 00:05:41,300
cause planes,
tires,

101
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,193
even toothpaste.
Everything is manufactured by the same 

102
00:05:46,851 --> 00:05:47,684
holding company whose companies support 
each other by and sell products between 

103
00:05:50,361 --> 00:05:54,080
themselves and even have their own banks
to finance themselves.

104
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,650
So what's the problem this?
Well,

105
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,060
these large conglomerates tended to be 
very bureaucratic and not very flexible.

106
00:06:03,190 --> 00:06:04,020
Yeah.

107
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,110
So decision making was a very difficult 
and slow process,

108
00:06:07,140 --> 00:06:07,973
but the Japanese government decided to 
compensate them for all of these 

109
00:06:10,051 --> 00:06:10,884
disadvantages and to didn't hesitate to 
give the Keiretsu all kinds of 

110
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:15,830
advantages and privileges.
For example,

111
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:16,673
Japan central bank finance them 
generously at abnormally low rates 

112
00:06:19,621 --> 00:06:21,690
through specific programs.
However,

113
00:06:21,750 --> 00:06:24,050
the results,
they were not

114
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:24,973
good.

115
00:06:25,420 --> 00:06:29,050
See these large groups became very 
influential in the country's politics.

116
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:29,913
They also had many problems because of 
course when one of these conglomerates 

117
00:06:32,201 --> 00:06:35,340
companies did badly,
it was extremely easy for them to infect

118
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:37,480
the rest.
They were also in a lot of debt and they

119
00:06:37,481 --> 00:06:38,320
even limited common

120
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:39,293
tissue.

121
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:43,540
I mean how can one compete with such 
groups if they are also protected by the

122
00:06:43,541 --> 00:06:45,940
government and to have all kinds of 
privileges.

123
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:48,220
It's a pretty hard thing to ask.
On the other hands.

124
00:06:48,221 --> 00:06:49,054
In Germany the political commitments was
completely different and focused on 

125
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:55,450
creating a very competitive market with 
small and medium sized company,

126
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,320
all that large industrial ribs in 
Germany.

127
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,470
Well of course there are and that's a 
good thing as long as they don't,

128
00:07:07,471 --> 00:07:11,550
depends on the government or receive 
privileges that impede competition.

129
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:15,330
So while Germany's companies thrive to 
Japan's and large conglomerates have had

130
00:07:15,331 --> 00:07:19,110
many problems and most of disappeared or
broken down at some point,

131
00:07:19,140 --> 00:07:24,140
but that's not all discount policy

132
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:33,190
is Japanese politicians thought that in 
order to export more,

133
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,790
devaluing the currency from time to time
was not a bad thing.

134
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:39,250
However,
in 1985 the real problems began.

135
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:43,180
See as a result of all these currency 
wars,

136
00:07:43,181 --> 00:07:47,410
the United States gained a fairly large 
external deficits and because Washington

137
00:07:47,411 --> 00:07:50,410
politicians of the time,
as they do now didn't like it,

138
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:51,333
they forced the so called plaza record 
and agreements between the United 

139
00:07:54,700 --> 00:07:55,061
States,
Japan,

140
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:55,721
Germany,
France,

141
00:07:55,721 --> 00:07:59,710
and the United Kingdom to depreciate the
dollar to decrease the trade deficits.

142
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:01,683
As you can imagine,
this was a huge blow to the Japanese 

143
00:08:03,551 --> 00:08:04,384
industry who was used to competing with 
a little bit of help and then the 

144
00:08:07,091 --> 00:08:10,790
government is sank its interest rates 
and began boosting credit like there was

145
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:11,920
no tomorrow

146
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:20,440
[inaudible]

147
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:24,820
the result of this,
well that was a huge debt spiral.

148
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:25,683
Banks distributing money like crazy and 
a massive bubble in the real estate and 

149
00:08:29,741 --> 00:08:32,050
financial markets.
And you know what happened next?

150
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:37,080
Well in 1990 this entire house of cards 
began to collapse in Germany.

151
00:08:40,131 --> 00:08:43,100
However,
as we also saw here at visual politics,

152
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:46,850
but governments opposite to maintain a 
strong mark that currency at the time,

153
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,990
which on one hand forced companies to 
compete in productivity and innovation,

154
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:51,853
but on the other allowed them to buy 
foreign technology and machines under 

155
00:08:55,171 --> 00:08:57,000
better terms.
But dear viewer,

156
00:08:57,001 --> 00:09:00,060
there is still a third ends determinant.
Different

157
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:06,050
walked

158
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:07,190
within themselves.

159
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,160
Japan

160
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,410
is the most elderly country in the 
world,

161
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,273
just over 25% of its population.
That is everyone in for Japanese people 

162
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:19,700
are over 65 and for every hour that 
passes,

163
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:22,340
the country's population drops by 50 
people.

164
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,443
The Japanese government expects the 
country's population to fall below 100 

165
00:09:28,810 --> 00:09:29,643
million people by the year 2050 and of 
course the more elderly citizens there 

166
00:09:32,591 --> 00:09:33,424
are,
the less young people there are in the 

167
00:09:34,301 --> 00:09:35,230
liver,
the population.

168
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,093
This has clear consequences for one more
public spending on pensions and 

169
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,530
healthcare and for another less

170
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:42,503
labor.

171
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:44,913
Many other countries have this problem,
but Japan's case is by far the most 

172
00:09:48,251 --> 00:09:51,340
serious.
And this isn't by chance at all.

173
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,100
Japanese companies.
I've compensated for all of the problems

174
00:09:57,101 --> 00:10:00,190
caused by the bad policies that we 
talked about in this video.

175
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:01,063
They forced their employees to work 
longer hours than in other developed 

176
00:10:03,161 --> 00:10:03,994
countries,
which obviously it leaves very little 

177
00:10:05,261 --> 00:10:07,810
time to think about starting a family 
and what's more,

178
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,673
what some countries like Germany have 
favored the arrival of immigrants who 

179
00:10:11,561 --> 00:10:13,720
tend to have higher population growth 
rates.

180
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,670
Japan has closed its doors.

181
00:10:18,570 --> 00:10:19,403
In fact,
when international organizations tell 

182
00:10:20,881 --> 00:10:23,910
Japan that they have to open their 
borders to immigration to face the aging

183
00:10:23,911 --> 00:10:24,744
problem,
the Japanese government's has even said 

184
00:10:26,641 --> 00:10:27,474
this in Japan's finance minister tells 
elderly they should hurry up and die to 

185
00:10:31,651 --> 00:10:33,630
help reduce countries rising welfare 
bill,

186
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:34,583
sorry.
These are the fundamental causes that 

187
00:10:35,761 --> 00:10:36,594
have led Japan to live in continuous 
crisis and the courses that have made 

188
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,950
the German model clearly better than the
Japanese one.

189
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:42,803
So now over to you,
do you think that Japan will be able to 

190
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,940
overcome this period of stagnation and 
seemingly permanent crisis?

191
00:10:47,941 --> 00:10:48,774
Well,
