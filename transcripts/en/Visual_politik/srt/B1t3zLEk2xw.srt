1
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:08,903
Does he know there is a country in South
America when most of its population are 

2
00:00:12,091 --> 00:00:15,780
of Indian origin and where the official 
language is English.

3
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,513
Now,
if you don't know which country I'm 

4
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:22,254
talking about,
don't worry because this is one of the 

5
00:00:24,061 --> 00:00:26,910
least known countries in the region,
and to be fair,

6
00:00:26,911 --> 00:00:29,880
the media doesn't really pay that much 
attention to it,

7
00:00:29,930 --> 00:00:32,850
so really small as a country that the 
media don't talk about very much.

8
00:00:32,851 --> 00:00:35,210
Well,
that sounds like the perfect ingredients

9
00:00:35,211 --> 00:00:36,044
for a visual politic.
Talking about Guyana that owns British 

10
00:00:43,241 --> 00:00:46,870
colony,
who didn't get independence until 1966.

11
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:49,120
Interestingly at the moment of 
independence,

12
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:50,013
both the government's [inaudible] 
popular opinion was generally in favor 

13
00:00:52,811 --> 00:00:55,840
of turning guy on it into a socialist 
country.

14
00:00:55,870 --> 00:00:58,030
It was this mindset which gave the 
country.

15
00:00:58,031 --> 00:01:02,440
It's Pinto ask official name,
the Cooperative Republic of Guyana,

16
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,500
but let's focus on the country today.
Diana is one of the poorest countries in

17
00:01:07,601 --> 00:01:08,434
South America and violence rates that 
are some of the highest in the entire 

18
00:01:15,901 --> 00:01:18,300
region,
and that's saying a lot.

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,480
In fact,
if going on,

20
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,314
it is known for anything,
it would be for its place in the 

21
00:01:22,051 --> 00:01:24,660
international supply of cocaine.
Oh,

22
00:01:24,661 --> 00:01:27,720
and also for having one of the highest 
suicide rates in the world,

23
00:01:27,721 --> 00:01:30,540
so not exactly brilliant things.
Now,

24
00:01:30,541 --> 00:01:31,374
with all of this information,
you'd be forgiven for not being 

25
00:01:33,421 --> 00:01:36,780
optimistic about the future of this 
Caribbean country,

26
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:40,110
but they may be about to get a lot 
luckier.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:47,690
Oh yeah.
Signs pointed to.

28
00:01:47,691 --> 00:01:48,524
Guiana becoming an oil power for there's
only being this small republic with a 

29
00:01:51,921 --> 00:01:52,754
population of about 750,000
inhabitants has already got the 

30
00:01:56,031 --> 00:02:00,160
attention and dollars of multinational 
companies such as Exxon or

31
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:04,750
that's

32
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:08,110
after several years exploring the area.
On January the 13th,

33
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:08,944
2017 things to powerful oil companies 
announced the discovery of water they 

34
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,223
think could be one of the most 
significant oil and gas reserves found 

35
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:18,813
decades.
Oil reserves have been found in deep 

36
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:21,514
waters in the scene.
Menzel under the coastal waters of 

37
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:28,000
Deanna early calculations estimate that 
the amount of oil which can be exploited

38
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:28,834
in the country is no less than 4,000
million barrels and many experts from 

39
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,563
this could be a much larger quantity,
so it seems that this country holds a 

40
00:02:38,291 --> 00:02:39,124
huge fortune just off it's shores.
That's the question really is how much 

41
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,690
is this all really worth considering the
price of oil nowadays,

42
00:02:46,691 --> 00:02:50,170
we're talking about roughly 
$200,000,000,000,

43
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:54,120
so leaving other natural resources 
asides and considering only petrol.

44
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:58,300
This would result in the equivalent of 
$250,000

45
00:02:58,330 --> 00:02:59,163
per citizen.
And it's important to note that the oil 

46
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,750
reserves can be much bigger than the 
early calculations in.

47
00:03:03,751 --> 00:03:04,584
Yeah,

48
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:07,170
no,

49
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,003
it is true that oil exploitation is 
expensive and requires enormous 

50
00:03:11,641 --> 00:03:12,474
investments,
but this could still be the first step 

51
00:03:14,461 --> 00:03:15,294
in a new era of prosperity 40 on it.
So far of the oil companies I've 

52
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:24,291
mentioned Exxon mobile and has have 
committed to investing $900,000,000

53
00:03:24,511 --> 00:03:25,344
a year in Ghana over the next few years.
The government is investing to with 

54
00:03:28,861 --> 00:03:31,500
plans to start exporting oil in 20,
20.

55
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:32,363
This means Guiana,
it could be on the cusp of becoming one 

56
00:03:34,501 --> 00:03:38,670
of the greatest economic developments 
that South America has ever.

57
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,230
Yes,

58
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:49,170
Ghana,
that poor violence country.

59
00:03:49,171 --> 00:03:50,004
You could become the kinds of country 
which other people in South America who 

60
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:56,320
are unemployed might look at and think,
I want to change my life.

61
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:58,870
I once opportunities,
I want to go to Ghana.

62
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:01,900
Ghana could become that big hope for 
many.

63
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,410
I'm employed South American people.
Nevertheless,

64
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,980
before they start packing a,
we have to say that it's not going to be

65
00:04:08,981 --> 00:04:09,814
that easy.
The road ahead is going to be fraught 

66
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:12,700
with difficulties.

67
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:17,040
Yeah,

68
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:18,530
with Venezuela,

69
00:04:19,460 --> 00:04:20,040
much better.

70
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:20,873
The oil exploration is happening in 
areas that have been claimed by 

71
00:04:23,131 --> 00:04:23,964
Venezuela and is the part they have 
claimed is not exactly small Madora who 

72
00:04:28,261 --> 00:04:30,450
considers the region known as Guiana 
asset.

73
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,293
[inaudible] burned to be vast and this 
region represents more than 70 percent 

74
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,110
of

75
00:04:35,110 --> 00:04:35,943
surface,

76
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,773
so essentially Venezuela is claiming the
entire country as their own and as if 

77
00:04:42,831 --> 00:04:43,664
this wasn't bad enough and other area 
which makes up seven percent of its 

78
00:04:46,311 --> 00:04:49,280
territory is claimed by their neighbors 
in Suriname.

79
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,173
If their neighbors had their way,
Guiana would have been carved up and 

80
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:53,234
split between them a long time ago.
The thing is this conflict over 

81
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,790
territory seemed to have been forgotten 
for years.

82
00:04:58,820 --> 00:04:59,653
This was likely a consequence of the 
good relations that the government's 

83
00:05:02,061 --> 00:05:02,894
kept with Cuba,
a country that holds a lot of influence 

84
00:05:05,121 --> 00:05:05,954
over this part of the world.
It was also likely because Venezuela 

85
00:05:11,510 --> 00:05:14,200
wanted the support of organizations such
as Caricom,

86
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:17,360
the Caribbean Community of which Guiana 
is a member.

87
00:05:17,361 --> 00:05:21,500
So now you might be wondering,
is Agi on a Caribbean country or is it a

88
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,030
South American country?
Well,

89
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:25,640
it's sort of both geographically 
speaking,

90
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:29,060
the country is in South America,
but politically,

91
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,290
culturally and socially speaking.
Guiana is a Caribbean country.

92
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,213
In fact,
Guiana was one of the countries which 

93
00:05:35,691 --> 00:05:36,524
used to benefits from petro an 
initiative by Hugo Chavez that we're 

94
00:05:39,721 --> 00:05:40,554
supplying cheap,
high quality oil to those countries 

95
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:43,273
which were deemed France,
but it all changed when on May the 11th 

96
00:05:46,251 --> 00:05:47,084
of 2005,
the left wing governments of the 

97
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:50,743
People's Progressive Party lost the 
general election to a coalition headed 

98
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:54,860
by their new president,
David granger.

99
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,753
A man who was closer to Washington and 
who to end once and for all the claims 

100
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,404
coming from

101
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:01,293
way less,

102
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:04,983
it was at that moment that the long 
ignored conflict to defrost it and 

103
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:10,000
things really started to heat up.

104
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,150
It's still carrying a monkey on its 
back.

105
00:06:13,270 --> 00:06:18,270
That monkey is the unbearable burden of 
an oppressive and obnoxious Cleveland on

106
00:06:18,811 --> 00:06:20,100
land and sea space.

107
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,013
Now,
the conflict is in the hands of the 

108
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,920
United Nations,
but whatever the solution might be,

109
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:25,813
if there is any,
it's important to be aware of this 

110
00:06:27,561 --> 00:06:30,520
threat to the potential prosperous 
future after gone.

111
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,500
Racial conflict.

112
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,330
Important risk is the recurrence.
Racial conflicts in Guyana,

113
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:43,240
which is a continuous presence in the 
countries media.

114
00:06:43,270 --> 00:06:47,080
Deanna is a complex country 
demographically around 50 percent of its

115
00:06:47,081 --> 00:06:51,190
population is of Indian origin,
while 40 percent is of African origin.

116
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,760
Those are two big groups who are not 
exactly on the friendliest of terms.

117
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:02,460
In fact,
the black minority claims that for years

118
00:07:02,461 --> 00:07:03,294
the Indian majority has obtained 
privileges from the government and 

119
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:06,743
always got that way.
This is triggered recurrence waves of 

120
00:07:08,911 --> 00:07:09,744
violence.
Luckily the situation seems to have 

121
00:07:11,371 --> 00:07:13,410
improved.
In fact is the winning coalition,

122
00:07:13,411 --> 00:07:15,070
governments is quite multiracial.

123
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,233
There is still the possibility that 
further internal conflict will flare up 

124
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,083
in any case,
not only does this new governments have 

125
00:07:25,531 --> 00:07:27,900
an opportunity to overcome decades of 
conflict,

126
00:07:27,901 --> 00:07:28,734
it's once and for all,
but it's also being looked to to find 

127
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:31,553
violence and corruption in the country,
something that Ganas certainly needs to 

128
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:35,903
be one of the most corrupt countries in 
the world according to Transparency 

129
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,313
International.
So the new government has quite a few 

130
00:07:41,191 --> 00:07:43,680
major tasks ahead of them,
oil exploitation,

131
00:07:43,681 --> 00:07:47,160
as well as the fight against corruption 
and criminality and the country.

132
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:49,350
The thing is,
if they achieved their goals,

133
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:50,223
Guiana will attract great attention and 
me become one of the richest countries 

134
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:54,713
in South America,
but this will only be if they use their 

135
00:07:57,061 --> 00:08:00,450
resources well,
but the question is will that happen?

136
00:08:00,750 --> 00:08:04,140
And it's certainly a big question.
So we've given you our opinion,

137
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:06,390
here are visual politics and now we'd 
love to know what you think.

138
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:10,110
Do you think Guiana will successfully 
take advantage of their newly discovered

139
00:08:10,111 --> 00:08:12,930
oil and what position do you think 
Venezuela should adopt?

140
