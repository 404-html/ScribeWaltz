1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
So somebody who is of this channel often
ask us why we're the channel called 

2
00:00:02,551 --> 00:00:05,070
visual politic.
We make videos about companies,

3
00:00:05,071 --> 00:00:05,904
for example,
we've already talked about Amazon into 

4
00:00:07,201 --> 00:00:09,340
text and Tessa among many others.
Well,

5
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,940
we do this for two fundamental reasons.
Now,

6
00:00:11,941 --> 00:00:15,030
if the first one is that we see politics
in a broad sense,

7
00:00:15,031 --> 00:00:15,864
and this means that we can talk about 
politics without considering economic 

8
00:00:18,721 --> 00:00:19,554
and social issues.
Of course I day I think we can deny the 

9
00:00:21,811 --> 00:00:24,600
huge influence that big companies play 
on our lives.

10
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:28,930
Second

11
00:00:28,930 --> 00:00:31,570
only we know that many of you love these
kinds of videos.

12
00:00:31,571 --> 00:00:33,720
So we keep making them and you know,
well,

13
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:36,490
we like these kinds of videos too.
So here we are.

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:39,070
So in this video we're gonna have a 
pretty interesting combination.

15
00:00:39,071 --> 00:00:42,700
We've got the company of BMW and the 
countries of Germany and China.

16
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:52,063
As we mentioned here,
a visual holistic Germany is the mother 

17
00:00:54,171 --> 00:00:55,004
factory of the wells.
It's the place where machines and the 

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:01:00,140
things that go into the other things 
that other countries produce,

19
00:01:00,450 --> 00:01:01,090
manufacture

20
00:01:01,090 --> 00:01:01,923
shit.

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,480
Of course,
of all of the industries,

22
00:01:05,481 --> 00:01:06,314
the automobile industry is without a 
doubt the most famous and also the most 

23
00:01:09,771 --> 00:01:12,260
peculiar,
we all know that brands like Mercedes,

24
00:01:12,261 --> 00:01:13,550
BMW,
Volkswagen,

25
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:14,460
Porsche,
opal,

26
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:15,294
and Audi are all jokes because Germany 
isn't any one of the largest copper 

27
00:01:21,701 --> 00:01:22,534
producers in the wells.
It is also considered the cradle of the 

28
00:01:24,711 --> 00:01:25,990
first cop.
Yes,

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:26,833
you heard that right?
Seen 85 a German engineer called Karl 

30
00:01:33,070 --> 00:01:35,890
Benz trying to place a combustion engine
into a three wheels.

31
00:01:35,891 --> 00:01:36,724
Chariots.
This was known as the bend patent motor 

32
00:01:39,221 --> 00:01:40,054
wagon atoms.
It was able to reach an astounding 

33
00:01:41,351 --> 00:01:43,350
seeing.
You'd all 16 Colombo

34
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:44,213
does now

35
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:51,520
25 units were manufactured and in one of
them,

36
00:01:51,521 --> 00:01:54,040
Bertha Benz,
Cole's wife needs what is considered the

37
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:58,270
first contract in history for a distance
of actually 94 kilometers,

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,100
which isn't bad.
Now that something you might be thinking

39
00:02:00,101 --> 00:02:01,220
about right now,
and that's the,

40
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:03,430
well back then the were no petrol 
stations.

41
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:06,520
So how exactly did Bertha Benz refuel?
Well,

42
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:10,520
she did this by buying a petroleum 
derivative in pharmacies called AESOP.

43
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,423
That's right.
We could say that pharmacies where the 

44
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:13,894
first gas stations in history,
but of course that's not the reason why 

45
00:02:16,901 --> 00:02:19,570
cars in Germany are quite so important.

46
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,083
See,

47
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,630
because more machines are always needed.
The automotive industry to viewer is one

48
00:02:28,631 --> 00:02:32,170
of the most productive and most 
capitalized so well what better place to

49
00:02:32,171 --> 00:02:35,530
manufacture them than Germany,
the country of machines.

50
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,880
However,
despite all of this,

51
00:02:36,881 --> 00:02:37,714
let's just say that in recent times the 
German automotive industry as the 

52
00:02:41,351 --> 00:02:42,184
European automotive industry in general 
hasn't been the most popular danger of 

53
00:02:52,161 --> 00:02:52,994
extinction.
Yeah.

54
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:55,953
In recent times that has been a 
widespread feeling that the traditional 

55
00:02:58,301 --> 00:03:00,550
automotive industry,
and especially as we said,

56
00:03:00,551 --> 00:03:01,384
European manufacturers will be the big 
losers of the upcoming electric car and 

57
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,850
autonomous car revenue.

58
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:08,490
You should

59
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:15,540
want one of those old companies when we 
have fresh and innovative companies like

60
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:16,403
Tesla.
Now this is something we've actually 

61
00:03:21,671 --> 00:03:23,530
talked about on this channel not so long
ago,

62
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:26,230
despite never having made any money in 
producing very few cars,

63
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:27,093
tesla has a market value for it is as 
large as that of BMW and which is far 

64
00:03:30,821 --> 00:03:33,640
superior to companies such as Renno or 
Persia.

65
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,540
So how is this possible?
Well,

66
00:03:37,541 --> 00:03:40,960
as we saw basically because many 
investors consider this in a few years,

67
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:43,660
Tesla will literally take over the 
markets.

68
00:03:43,730 --> 00:03:46,990
[inaudible] the viewer is where 
questions began to arise.

69
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:49,300
We'll the electric car transition really
be that quick.

70
00:03:49,330 --> 00:03:52,960
A European manufacturer is too late to 
join this resolution.

71
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,720
Well,
I don't know what you think,

72
00:03:58,721 --> 00:04:02,500
but some information at least does not 
seem to support these ideas.

73
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:06,340
According to a recent study from the Ifo
Institute,

74
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:07,203
Europe owns almost half of all patents 
related to the electric car leading the 

75
00:04:10,871 --> 00:04:14,140
world ranking and being well ahead of 
countries such as Japan,

76
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,680
23% and the United States 18% Yvonne 
Martin,

77
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:21,490
president and Chief Investment Officer 
of my Guyana's value

78
00:04:21,610 --> 00:04:26,610
[inaudible].

79
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:29,423
Now let's assume that Elon musk is right
and tesla managers to overcome all of 

80
00:04:32,911 --> 00:04:35,010
the problems that currently affects it.
For example,

81
00:04:35,011 --> 00:04:35,844
the production of the model three and 
thus fulfills his most ambitious 

82
00:04:38,671 --> 00:04:43,050
forecast managing to sell 2 million cars
in 2022 this means that he would have to

83
00:04:43,051 --> 00:04:43,884
multiply his production capacity and not
to buy two or by five but by 20 in just 

84
00:04:48,601 --> 00:04:49,434
over four years,
one in that same year at least 110 

85
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,020
million vehicles are expected to be 
produced in the world.

86
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,990
[inaudible]

87
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:04,630
when we consider these strong growth of 
the middle class in emerging markets,

88
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:07,750
I would actually be on a far greater 
vehicle production than that,

89
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:10,570
but let's just be prudent and stick with
that number.

90
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,463
Out of those 110 million cost,
no more than 20% are expected to be 

91
00:05:14,501 --> 00:05:16,990
electric cars or even just plug in 
hybrids.

92
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:18,580
So what exactly does that mean?
Well,

93
00:05:18,581 --> 00:05:19,414
what it means is in the best case 
scenario for Tessa would have a market 

94
00:05:22,151 --> 00:05:26,670
share in the industry of less than 2% 
and 9% in the electric car

95
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:32,640
[inaudible].

96
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,453
We can say that the cards that not even 
dealt yet and so that even if Tesla's 

97
00:05:41,590 --> 00:05:42,423
best forecasts on mass,
then we'll still be many companies in 

98
00:05:45,221 --> 00:05:47,140
the market.
Companies such as BMW,

99
00:05:58,030 --> 00:05:58,780
he ended up here

100
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:01,810
is one of the great icons in German 
industry,

101
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,100
robust,
luxurious,

102
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,040
technologically advanced cars who 
doesn't want to be honest.

103
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:06,923
How about you?

104
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,693
In line of the past 10 years,
this brand has been the world's leader 

105
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,720
in premium costs and the truth is that 
this is pretty interesting.

106
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:21,070
He,

107
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:21,903
this company besides owning bmw also 
owns mini and Rolls Royce and at the 

108
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:26,224
time of publishing this video has a 
market value that is very similar to 

109
00:06:28,481 --> 00:06:30,500
that of Tesla at about 50 billion

110
00:06:31,460 --> 00:06:32,293
donuts.

111
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:35,990
This both companies have many,
many differences.

112
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:39,413
While in 2016 Elon Musk's company 
managed to sell 76,000 cause while 

113
00:06:43,171 --> 00:06:44,004
losing $770 million,
the German company sold 2.3 6 million 

114
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:48,774
calls.
And how they profit after tax of more 

115
00:06:50,611 --> 00:06:52,620
than $7 billion.

116
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:54,490
Okay.

117
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:55,323
All right,
so now I know what many of you are 

118
00:06:56,081 --> 00:06:57,550
probably thinking,
wait a minute,

119
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,384
Simon,
this isn't a fair competition and Tesla 

120
00:06:59,681 --> 00:07:02,860
is currently investing in research and 
the developing new technologies.

121
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:05,650
What BMW makes the same cause they've 
been making forever.

122
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:08,420
Well it isn't actually quite like that.
Let me explain.

123
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:11,503
In 2016 for example,
the gem and grief invested more than $5 

124
00:07:14,510 --> 00:07:16,040
billion in research and development.
Meanwhile,

125
00:07:16,041 --> 00:07:18,030
tests,
his investment was funny of time,

126
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:20,930
smaller,
slightly less than $1 billion.

127
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:21,823
And of course a lot of that BMW 
investment money is going to developing 

128
00:07:24,810 --> 00:07:25,643
electric and autonomous models w to 
spend $237 million on battery cell 

129
00:07:33,871 --> 00:07:35,610
center.
And that's not all.

130
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,503
Okay,
so here's a question for you and please 

131
00:07:38,011 --> 00:07:39,720
do not give a listen sheet.
Which company,

132
00:07:39,721 --> 00:07:44,721
BMW or Tesla do you think is going to 
sell more electric cars in 2017 now,

133
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:51,970
many of you are probably batting on 
Tesla right now by a lot,

134
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:53,003
right?

135
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,593
Well wait just a second because the 
truth is that taking both electric cars 

136
00:07:57,271 --> 00:08:01,020
and the plug in hybrids into accounts,
both companies are actually very close.

137
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:01,913
Now.
It does look like Tesla is going to win 

138
00:08:03,241 --> 00:08:07,560
this race with a few weeks left in 2017 
but it's seriously close.

139
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:08,453
In fact,
both companies are expected to close 

140
00:08:09,571 --> 00:08:13,680
2017 sales with approximately a hundred 
thousand electric cars.

141
00:08:13,681 --> 00:08:14,491
Salt,
yes.

142
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,324
Okay,
so I'm sure some of you are going to 

143
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:17,760
argue,
but Tesla has stored a lot of it's model

144
00:08:17,761 --> 00:08:20,700
three cars,
which in principle translates into sales

145
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:21,534
for the next few years.
Model three will be new territory for 

146
00:08:24,451 --> 00:08:27,270
CEO,
Elon Musk and Tesla as a company.

147
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,140
The sedan has already received at least 
400,000 preorders.

148
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:32,063
That is true,
but the German brand also hopes to 

149
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:34,900
improve it.
Yeah,

150
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:39,900
it's numbers in short,
short,

151
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:43,630
as we always say here,
a visual politic.

152
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,410
The future is by definition I'm Satin 
Tesla.

153
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:49,270
It could be a great company,
but it's not going to be the only one.

154
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:53,020
The truth is the by selling almost as 
many electric cars is Tesla by investing

155
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:53,854
five times more in r and d and by owning
a cumulative profit of more than $30 

156
00:08:57,750 --> 00:08:58,583
billion in the last five years,
I think we can say that BMW is at least 

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,730
a very important competitor.
In fact,

158
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:06,593
it is surprising that both company's 
market value is practically the same 

159
00:09:09,151 --> 00:09:13,230
considering that expectations for one so
much higher than they offer the other.

160
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:15,450
This is especially when we consider that
in recent years,

161
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:20,190
BMW has become a major and very 
important player in the Chinese market.

162
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:25,990
Okay,

163
00:09:25,990 --> 00:09:27,400
great.
Chinese market

164
00:09:29,480 --> 00:09:30,100
since

165
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:33,580
2007 and despite the international 
economic crisis,

166
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:34,443
the BMW group has managed in less than 
10 years to increase the number of cars 

167
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:42,691
it's making from 1.5 million in 2007 to 
2.3 7 million in 2016 and of course that

168
00:09:44,531 --> 00:09:47,410
translates into more income and also 
mop.

169
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:55,183
BMW is nets benefits.
That is the money that's left for the 

170
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,780
company after taxes has more than 
doubled in this period of time.

171
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:05,900
Check out this graph,
that graph,

172
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,860
we could see that things have gone 
rather wealthy

173
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,003
company.

174
00:10:14,940 --> 00:10:19,230
One of the pieces that has greatly aided
this progress is actually China.

175
00:10:19,290 --> 00:10:20,123
Take a look at how the market has it.
And then 16 I managed to sell half a 

176
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:28,913
million cars out of which 300 thousands 
were manufactured in China itself 

177
00:10:32,281 --> 00:10:36,180
through a partnership with a local 
company and 200,000 were importers,

178
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,730
mostly from factories that the company 
has in Germany.

179
00:10:42,650 --> 00:10:43,483
Other way

180
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:48,630
it's one out of every four cars sold by 
the BMW group is already in China.

181
00:10:48,710 --> 00:10:49,543
Uh,
markets where the automobile out will 

182
00:10:50,671 --> 00:10:53,490
surge in the upcoming years along with 
its middle class.

183
00:10:55,290 --> 00:10:56,070
Well,
the fact is the,

184
00:10:56,070 --> 00:10:56,903
beyond any comparison with Tesla,
BMW is Chinese adventure shows us a 

185
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:01,014
couple of things.
The first is that far from what is 

186
00:11:02,491 --> 00:11:03,324
usually said,
China could be a great source of 

187
00:11:04,711 --> 00:11:05,544
opportunities and wealth.
It's something which incidentally we've 

188
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:09,300
been mentioning all the visual politic 
for quite a lot

189
00:11:09,390 --> 00:11:12,490
time.
Yeah.

190
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:16,500
18 million Chinese people join the 
middle class and this has very clear,

191
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,170
obvious consequences on their ability to
Spanish.

192
00:11:19,240 --> 00:11:21,750
Secondly,
it is very common to hear politicians of

193
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:24,750
all backgrounds arguing,
but in order to export more,

194
00:11:24,780 --> 00:11:27,300
the currency needs to be devalued.
Well,

195
00:11:27,330 --> 00:11:29,100
Germany in fact,
they say quite the opposite.

196
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:33,590
What is required isn't a cheap currency.
It's competitiveness and a good product.

197
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:38,440
Yup.

198
00:11:38,440 --> 00:11:39,273
That is something we are going to talk 
about another time and now it's your 

199
00:11:41,981 --> 00:11:42,814
turn.
If you have to choose which company 

200
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:44,673
would you bet on?
Would it be tesla or would it be bmw at 

201
00:11:46,721 --> 00:11:47,554
the end of the day?
As we've seen both having very similar 

202
00:11:49,391 --> 00:11:50,224
market value.
So please do leave your answer in the 

203
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:56,830
