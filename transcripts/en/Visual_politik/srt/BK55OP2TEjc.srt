1
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:08,553
In the last few years,
there has been growing uncertainty and 

2
00:00:10,631 --> 00:00:14,140
concern over what's the future of jobs 
will look like,

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,630
especially for those who are in 
developed countries,

4
00:00:16,631 --> 00:00:17,710
robotics,
Ai,

5
00:00:17,711 --> 00:00:19,690
immigration,
international competition.

6
00:00:19,691 --> 00:00:21,250
They are all hot topics.

7
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:22,273
Six,

8
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:26,923
according to some people,
we will have to get used to a future 

9
00:00:29,421 --> 00:00:30,254
where a job will be considered a luxury,
a world of unemployment on a massive 

10
00:00:33,981 --> 00:00:36,500
scale.
It'll be a world of higher inequality,

11
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,393
of poor working conditions,
and that's just for those who aren't 

12
00:00:39,501 --> 00:00:40,340
lucky enough to have it.

13
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,283
Job

14
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,600
is not the west of us.
Most of the people who are foreseen such

15
00:00:49,601 --> 00:00:53,650
a critical situation also claimed this 
and less major changes take place and we

16
00:00:53,651 --> 00:00:55,660
try to slow down this frantic 
developments.

17
00:00:55,720 --> 00:01:00,160
Our wellbeing will be in serious danger,
certainly if there are not enough jobs,

18
00:01:00,161 --> 00:01:00,994
wealth and production will concentrate 
in a reduced but powerful oligarchy of 

19
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,150
businessmen and companies.
And this leads to the question,

20
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,030
how will ordinary people make a living 
who will pay taxes?

21
00:01:10,060 --> 00:01:10,893
How can the welfare state possibly 
survived for with so much 

22
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:15,430
unemployment's?
It all sounds pretty dreary,

23
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,293
doesn't it?
Almost as if we're going to be facing a 

24
00:01:17,921 --> 00:01:21,010
terrible storm many year now.
This uncertainty,

25
00:01:21,070 --> 00:01:24,110
it's made it easier for leaders like 
Donald Trump or marine le pen,

26
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,410
among others to get a leg up in 
politics.

27
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:27,273
Indeed.
Leaders who say that society is falling 

28
00:01:28,901 --> 00:01:31,900
apart and insist that they are the only 
ones who can fix it.

29
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,270
Do you tend to do rather well?
Well,

30
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:35,133
if there is such a thing,
then the only thing we can do is fight 

31
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,120
back and it is not just immigration 
we're talking about here.

32
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,920
Oh No,
there is so,

33
00:01:41,921 --> 00:01:42,754
so much more.
Amazon is doing great damage tax paying 

34
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:47,980
retailers,
towns,

35
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,740
cities and states throughout the u.
s are being hurt.

36
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:55,120
Many jobs being lost at real.
Donald trump on twitter,

37
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:55,983
but hold on just a second because are we
really had such a dark and dreary 

38
00:01:59,891 --> 00:02:00,724
future?
Our robots are really going to take our 

39
00:02:02,141 --> 00:02:04,480
jobs and destroy the system as we know 
it.

40
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:07,090
And is it true that unless we take 
radical action,

41
00:02:07,091 --> 00:02:09,580
we are in serious danger of losing our 
jobs?

42
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:10,443
Well,
in order to answer these questions and 

43
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:13,450
look at what lies beneath these 
statements,

44
00:02:13,451 --> 00:02:14,284
we have to pay close attention to what 
is currently happening in the world we 

45
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:17,764
live in and especially what is going on 
in the greatest and most influential 

46
00:02:21,131 --> 00:02:22,570
power on earth.
Yes,

47
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:25,960
of course,
we're talking about the United States of

48
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:26,793
America,

49
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:30,930
the end of employment,

50
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:35,260
self driving cars,
self learning machinery,

51
00:02:35,261 --> 00:02:37,810
factories without work as intelligent 
robots,

52
00:02:37,860 --> 00:02:38,693
less science fiction,
then more science facts every single 

53
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,660
day.
And you know this technological wave.

54
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:45,850
It's just begun.
Nanotechnology,

55
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,760
biotechnology,
genetic engineering and robotics.

56
00:02:48,761 --> 00:02:52,180
They seem to be changing the world as we
know it every day.

57
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,073
These technologies,
multiplying productivity and they can 

58
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:55,983
even replace human work in a report to 
the president from 2000 and Sixteen 

59
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:00,363
Council of economic advisors in the 
White House calculated that 83 percent 

60
00:03:02,861 --> 00:03:03,694
of jobs that were paid less than $20 per
hour would soon potentially be 

61
00:03:07,121 --> 00:03:08,530
automated.
In other words,

62
00:03:08,531 --> 00:03:09,364
countries with a faster development in 
robotics will be the first to suffer 

63
00:03:13,151 --> 00:03:13,984
from high sudden unemployment.
Millions and millions of people will 

64
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,400
simply become unemployed,
but the question now has to be,

65
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,070
is this really what the future holds the
future?

66
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:24,904
I mean it's always uncertain,
but we can already see what's happening 

67
00:03:27,611 --> 00:03:30,190
today and compare that to what it's 
going to be like in the future.

68
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,353
Robots,
they've already arrived and we can find 

69
00:03:32,831 --> 00:03:36,820
them everywhere in today's factories and
if we really dive into the figures,

70
00:03:36,821 --> 00:03:40,690
we see that the evidence shows the exact
opposite of what we might expect.

71
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,470
So just take a look at this chart here.
The countries using the most robots,

72
00:03:44,471 --> 00:03:48,400
other countries with the lowest rates of
unemployment as well.

73
00:03:48,401 --> 00:03:49,234
This it has an explanation.
Sometimes we consider all the jobs that 

74
00:03:52,061 --> 00:03:52,894
are lost as a result of this process,
but we ignore the new jobs that are 

75
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:59,200
being created as a result of all of this
automation,

76
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,470
new times,
new jobs.

77
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,200
Up until

78
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,033
now,
the industrial sector is the one when 

79
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:13,090
most robots have been used.
In fact,

80
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:13,953
some companies like Ford already have 
assembly lines made entirely out of 

81
00:04:17,171 --> 00:04:20,530
robots having no human workers at all.
Yet,

82
00:04:20,531 --> 00:04:24,490
American industrial production is almost
as high as it has ever been,

83
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:25,670
and now you must be wondering,
well,

84
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,390
what happens to all the industrial jobs?
Well,

85
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,420
have a look at this.
That's right in the 19 forties,

86
00:04:33,581 --> 00:04:34,414
one of every three jobs in America where
industrial jobs and now the number is 

87
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,140
barely one in 12,
which is four times less.

88
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,033
So does this mean that there are no 
employment opportunities in the United 

89
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,340
States?
Well,

90
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:47,260
actually,
nothing's further from the truth.

91
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,123
Since the 19 forties,
the US has created more than 86 million 

92
00:04:51,221 --> 00:04:54,130
new jobs in the service industry.
This includes transport,

93
00:04:54,131 --> 00:04:55,570
finance,
entertainment,

94
00:04:55,571 --> 00:04:57,670
and so on and so forth.
As a matter of fact,

95
00:04:57,671 --> 00:04:58,504
there has never been so many workers in 
this country and while we are 

96
00:05:01,540 --> 00:05:03,500
specifically talking about robotics 
here,

97
00:05:03,550 --> 00:05:06,790
the impacts of any new technology,
it has a similar effect.

98
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,653
Blockbuster,
which was once the largest video and 

99
00:05:09,131 --> 00:05:11,980
video game rental company in America may
have vanished.

100
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,843
Putin exchange.
We have new companies like Netflix or 

101
00:05:15,161 --> 00:05:17,290
even youtube and these kinds of 
companies.

102
00:05:17,291 --> 00:05:18,124
They generate loads of jobs,
but this is not just happening in 

103
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,650
America and it's not just happening with
robots or with video.

104
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,513
Consider the APP industry in Australia.
This new industry has already created 

105
00:05:28,241 --> 00:05:32,800
more than 113,000 jobs in one of the 
wealthiest countries in the world.

106
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:33,723
I believe me,
this is not just an Australian 

107
00:05:34,991 --> 00:05:35,824
phenomenon in the United States and 
deberry mind that this is a new sector 

108
00:05:38,261 --> 00:05:41,830
that has been born just a few years ago 
with the iphone and it's already created

109
00:05:41,831 --> 00:05:43,960
one point 5 million jobs.
Banks,

110
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:46,150
supermarkets,
insurance and software companies.

111
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,133
They all want to have their own app and 
that means new jobs are being created 

112
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,330
all of the time.
Further,

113
00:05:52,331 --> 00:05:54,370
as productivity grows,
normal working hours,

114
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:57,650
they're reduced,
so thanks to technology will work hours,

115
00:05:57,830 --> 00:05:59,390
which is another bit of great news.

116
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,993
I think for the next 30 years.
People only work four hours a day and 

117
00:06:07,461 --> 00:06:08,294
maybe four days a week.
My grandfather worked 16 hours a day in 

118
00:06:10,461 --> 00:06:12,290
the farmland and thought he was very 
busy.

119
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:15,410
We work eight hours five days a week and
we think we are very busy.

120
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:19,460
Jack Ma and finally let's as a little 
more detail,

121
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,323
some people like Bill Gates,
they've claimed the robots have taken 

122
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:24,830
jobs that were previously done by 
people.

123
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,190
Then therefore they should have to be 
paying tax and you know what?

124
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:29,720
Well,
I'm not so sure about that.

125
00:06:29,721 --> 00:06:31,940
I need robots.
They are just machines.

126
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:35,030
Simply the more machines and the more 
technology we have,

127
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,780
the better we live.
Robots reduce costs and as a consequence

128
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:41,300
they reduced the price of goods and 
this.

129
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,060
It allows consumers to work less and 
buying more,

130
00:06:44,061 --> 00:06:48,830
and this is why governments should boost
and encourage investment in technology,

131
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,723
but what is certainly true,
it's the society will have to prepare 

132
00:06:52,041 --> 00:06:54,950
for this automation process,
this technological change.

133
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:57,470
It is coming and it shouldn't be 
stopped.

134
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:03,893
Stop globalization.
Have you who regularly follow up visual 

135
00:07:07,991 --> 00:07:11,440
policy will know that trump has 
something of an obsession with China,

136
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,220
China,
China.

137
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:17,860
I love China all the time.
I Love Jack.

138
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,570
It's not just China.
In the last year,

139
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,310
trump is accused Canada,
Mexico,

140
00:07:22,311 --> 00:07:23,144
Japan,
and even South Korea of unfair 

141
00:07:24,951 --> 00:07:27,740
competition.
He has also claimed that these countries

142
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:28,633
are destroying American jobs.
This is why trump wants to renegotiate 

143
00:07:32,211 --> 00:07:34,820
trade agreements,
empower protectionist policies,

144
00:07:34,970 --> 00:07:38,480
and if needed,
set import tariffs in industries such as

145
00:07:38,481 --> 00:07:39,314
the steel industry.
It wouldn't be the first president in 

146
00:07:41,031 --> 00:07:44,700
the US to pursue this kind of strategy.
We need look no further than that.

147
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:45,853
George W dot Bush and other Republicans 
who set up import terrorists to steel 

148
00:07:48,921 --> 00:07:53,210
imports in 2002.
President Bush took some of the broadest

149
00:07:53,211 --> 00:07:57,200
federal action in two decades to protect
a major American industry today,

150
00:07:57,260 --> 00:07:58,093
imposing tariffs of up to 30 percent on 
most types of steel imported into the 

151
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,650
United States from Europe,
Asia,

152
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:07,340
and South America,
and truth be told the result,

153
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:08,174
it wasn't good.
Some studies have estimated that these 

154
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:14,120
steel tariffs resulted in the loss of 
more than 200,000 jobs.

155
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:19,500
Yep.

156
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:23,130
Not Policy lead to more unemployment's 
less competition.

157
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,840
Argentina,
it's another great example.

158
00:08:24,850 --> 00:08:27,870
Protectionism has had exactly the same 
results.

159
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,130
That's of course,
last exports also means less drops,

160
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,050
but that's not the end of it.
Now,

161
00:08:38,051 --> 00:08:38,884
it is true that in the last few decades,
industrial offshoring has caused us to 

162
00:08:42,311 --> 00:08:44,610
lose many jobs,
but in a way thanks to this,

163
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,483
countries like China have had an 
opportunity to develop and Chinese 

164
00:08:48,101 --> 00:08:51,400
businesspeople are now eager to invest 
in the United States,

165
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:52,323
seeing it as a safe place to make an 
investment in 2016 Chinese companies 

166
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:56,844
invested at $50,
billion dollars in the US and today 

167
00:08:59,311 --> 00:09:00,144
these companies have employed directly 
and indirectly more than a hundred and 

168
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:04,614
48,000 Americans.
That's nine times more than they were 

169
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:07,944
employing in 2009.
That is indeed the case of this 

170
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,530
businessman Mr Wang man who spent in 
2014,

171
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,490
$700,000,000 restoring a factory that 
General Motors had closed down.

172
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,493
Hi.

173
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:26,300
And it isn't just Chinese companies,
one in every five Americans is currently

174
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:28,540
working for foreign companies.
And remember,

175
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,383
as we said before,
never have been so many people working 

176
00:09:31,461 --> 00:09:32,294
in the United States.
So the story of globalization being 

177
00:09:34,731 --> 00:09:36,290
effected,
destroying our economies.

178
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,153
Well,
it seems like it's just that it's a 

179
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:43,481
story.
Prints are stealing our jobs.

180
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:48,680
You will

181
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:51,050
note that this is one of the biggest 
issues for people,

182
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:54,560
especially in the United States.
They're taking our jobs,

183
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:57,260
they're taking our manufacturing jobs,
they're taking our money,

184
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,450
they're killing us,
Donald Trump.

185
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,500
That is what trump has been saying,
but the reality is that the facts tell a

186
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,840
completely different story.
For instance,

187
00:10:05,841 --> 00:10:06,674
in 2016,
the United States got six Nobel prizes 

188
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:11,900
in science and economics.
All of them were awarded to immigrants.

189
00:10:11,901 --> 00:10:12,734
People born in a different country that 
now work at universities in the US and 

190
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:17,684
immigrants.
They tend to be more inclined towards 

191
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:19,694
entrepreneurship as well,
so even though immigration accounts for 

192
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,033
50 percent of the workforce in America,
immigrants are involved in creating one 

193
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,660
out of every three new companies in the 
US,

194
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:32,780
and those companies are the ones that 
are creating the most jobs.

195
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:34,940
And look,
there are two types of immigrants.

196
00:10:34,941 --> 00:10:37,160
On the one hand,
we've got the illegal immigrants.

197
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,080
They usually work in more physical jobs 
or the jobs Americans don't usually once

198
00:10:41,081 --> 00:10:43,130
and on the other hands,
we have legal immigrants.

199
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:45,710
Half of these immigrants have higher 
education.

200
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:49,700
This is a percentage far higher than 
people born in the US.

201
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,593
This type of immigration,
it provides vital brainpower to a 

202
00:10:52,911 --> 00:10:53,744
country,
and this is something that countries 

203
00:10:54,771 --> 00:10:55,604
desperately meat.
They also have an entrepreneurial 

204
00:10:57,441 --> 00:11:01,640
spirits and many of them are responsible
for many successful projects.

205
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,040
Procter and gamble,
Goldman Sachs,

206
00:11:04,130 --> 00:11:05,240
Yahoo,
Google,

207
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:06,740
Tesla,
att and t,

208
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,970
Intel,
Ebay,

209
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:09,290
IBM,
Citi Group,

210
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:10,790
ups,
Oracle,

211
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:11,683
Amazon,
or even apple or some of the many 

212
00:11:12,891 --> 00:11:13,724
companies founded or co founded by 
immigrants or the children of 

213
00:11:16,101 --> 00:11:16,934
immigrants.
So hopefully you can see that the best 

214
00:11:18,681 --> 00:11:22,820
thing about immigration is that not only
does it not steal jobs from Americans,

215
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:23,803
it actually creates more jobs for them.
So there's a lot of legends when it 

216
00:11:27,111 --> 00:11:29,480
comes to predicting the future of our 
lifestyles,

217
00:11:29,481 --> 00:11:33,080
but the reality is that the facts simply
don't live up to the fear.

218
00:11:33,140 --> 00:11:33,973
So there are a lot of legends when it 
comes to predicting the future of our 

219
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:39,650
lifestyles,
but the reality is that the facts,

220
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:42,390
they simply don't live up to the fear.
And this is our opinion here,

221
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,470
visual politic,
and now we'd love to know yours.

222
00:11:44,471 --> 00:11:47,210
Aren't you afraid of being replaced by a
robot?
