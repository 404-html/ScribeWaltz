1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:08,323
many of you probably think all the 
countries in the Arabian peninsula are 

3
00:00:10,851 --> 00:00:12,440
insanely wealthy,
right?

4
00:00:12,590 --> 00:00:15,020
I mean this is the region of the wells 
where Qatar do volume.

5
00:00:15,021 --> 00:00:15,854
The rest of the oral Monica is our after
all nonetheless arise in this region of 

6
00:00:18,681 --> 00:00:21,140
the planet is a country that is 
extremely poor.

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,640
The place where the GDP per capita lower
than that of Tanzania or Senegal,

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:26,713
the name of this country is Yemen and 
they just come with and going through a 

9
00:00:29,181 --> 00:00:34,181
civil war that is lost dude for two 
years and look this,

10
00:00:37,671 --> 00:00:38,900
this,
it's no small war.

11
00:00:38,901 --> 00:00:39,734
In fact,
the war in Yemen is the Arabian 

12
00:00:41,061 --> 00:00:41,894
equivalents to the war in Vietnam and we
find two of the biggest powers in the 

13
00:00:45,291 --> 00:00:48,320
Muslim world supporting different sides 
of the conflicts.

14
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,190
On the one hand we have the Yemeni 
government supported by Saudi Arabia and

15
00:00:52,220 --> 00:00:53,053
all their allies including the United 
States and the only other side of there 

16
00:00:56,300 --> 00:01:01,130
are the revolutionaries backed by Iran 
and between these two sides there is the

17
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,390
many branch of dash or the so called and
saw Al Sharia movement.

18
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:09,653
Now,
if you've been subscribed to visual 

19
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,263
politic for a while,
you already know that Saudi Arabia has 

20
00:01:13,051 --> 00:01:16,540
the third best equipped army in the 
entire wells boss.

21
00:01:16,541 --> 00:01:18,740
They have the sport of American drones 
exams,

22
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,980
the armies of neighboring countries.
They have more than 180 state of the art

23
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:27,540
combat jets and 300,000 soldiers armed 
with the best weapons on the other side.

24
00:01:27,541 --> 00:01:30,600
They have less than half that number of 
soldiers and the weapons.

25
00:01:30,601 --> 00:01:32,790
They're armed with our far for modern.
Yeah,

26
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:36,640
no,

27
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,160
this seems like a pretty unequal fight,
right?

28
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:40,570
Well,
in that case in mind,

29
00:01:40,571 --> 00:01:44,920
surprise you to learn that Saudi Arabia 
is losing this war.

30
00:01:47,410 --> 00:01:48,243
Saudi Arabia says prepared for ceasefire
in Yemen if who feeds agree and so now 

31
00:01:51,911 --> 00:01:54,520
you might wonder how exactly is this 
possible?

32
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,473
How is it possible to explain why one of
the most advanced armies in the wells 

33
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:01,030
can speak to a bunch of gorillas?
Well,

34
00:02:01,031 --> 00:02:02,200
today we have a geo politic.
Well,

35
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:05,290
we're going to answer that question,
but before we get into any of that,

36
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:10,620
let's have a look at the history.
The first thing we need to understand is

37
00:02:14,651 --> 00:02:18,010
that this is not the first time Yemen 
has had a civil war.

38
00:02:18,130 --> 00:02:21,550
In fact,
this is the third one in just 25 years.

39
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:25,780
Yemen is a country divided by both 
ideology as well as religion.

40
00:02:25,930 --> 00:02:26,763
Indeed,
before the 1990s at Yemen were split 

41
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:29,373
into two different countries.
We had south Yemen with a communist 

42
00:02:36,731 --> 00:02:38,950
governments and then there was north 
Yemen.

43
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:43,390
You had a pro Saudi government and going
you want to see on the screen now,

44
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:46,480
Ali Abdullah Saleh,
who was the president of the north,

45
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:49,960
started ruling over the entire country 
from its capital,

46
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:51,310
the city of Sonata.

47
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:56,183
As you can imagine,
slack is one of those politicians who 

48
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:01,240
consider as democracy and human rights 
to be wow.

49
00:03:01,241 --> 00:03:02,074
Pretty optional.
Four years into his new country's 

50
00:03:04,571 --> 00:03:05,404
history and the former southern 
communist leaders started an uprising 

51
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:09,844
against the less governments.
This war only lasted a few months and 

52
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:15,940
the new government is one with the 
assistance of the Saudis.

53
00:03:16,030 --> 00:03:19,960
A decade later in 2004 Yemen had further
antigovernment turmoil.

54
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:23,500
This time the opposition was a rebel 
group of Shia Muslims.

55
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,513
I remember their name because they are 
important for the war that's going on 

56
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:27,521
today.
If he,

57
00:03:27,521 --> 00:03:30,010
I called the Houthi rebels,
but again,

58
00:03:30,011 --> 00:03:32,130
these are like governments beach down 
this uprising.

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:33,033
Second

60
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,460
in 2011 with the Arab spring in full 
swing,

61
00:03:38,461 --> 00:03:40,980
the citizens rebelled against seller 
again.

62
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:41,963
But this time salon I left power with 
his prime minister Manso this new 

63
00:03:45,991 --> 00:03:49,170
president and found himself in control 
of a terribly weak governments.

64
00:03:49,260 --> 00:03:50,093
Father Ryle Chi.
Edo we're working on destroying the 

65
00:03:51,631 --> 00:03:53,130
country.
And during all of this,

66
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:55,290
while the protesters,
they kept protesting.

67
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,530
Now do you remember those few rentals?
And we talked about just a moment ago.

68
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:00,030
Well,
they came back,

69
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:03,930
but this time they were more powerful 
and it's had a lot of support.

70
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:08,040
And this explains why in 2014 they 
managed to take over the government.

71
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,350
Okay,
so now you might be wondering,

72
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:15,600
what did Al had he do?
Well,

73
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:16,434
he left the capital Lens,
moved to the city of Arden in the south 

74
00:04:18,691 --> 00:04:21,300
of the country to start a provisional.
Governments

75
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:30,780
not remember him that Saudi Arabia is a 
Sunni Muslim country bands.

76
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:31,614
Well,
who is the biggest enemy of Sunni 

77
00:04:32,910 --> 00:04:33,570
Muslims?
Oh yeah.

78
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:34,403
That would be the Shia Muslims.
These are exactly the people who have 

79
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:37,824
conquered the capital of Yemen,
and this explains why the Saudis aren't 

80
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,520
so keen on supporting our hardy and his 
provisional governments in arden.

81
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,683
Then finally,
we also have Dash Aka Islamic state in 

82
00:04:48,151 --> 00:04:51,380
the next as well,
who all well in enemy of both sides.

83
00:04:51,590 --> 00:04:52,423
All right,
so now we have the Houthi rebels and 

84
00:04:53,481 --> 00:04:54,314
their supporters,
the who things are Shia Muslims and 

85
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,200
therefore they are friends with Iran.
On the other hands,

86
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:00,043
Al Hadi is an artisan antia supported by
the Saudis and the Saudis will do 

87
00:05:04,311 --> 00:05:08,840
whatever it takes to ensure that Iranian
influence in Yemen is minimized.

88
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:09,913
You probably remember from one of our 
previous videos that Saudi Arabia and 

89
00:05:12,651 --> 00:05:17,390
Iran on die on enemies.
Anne's last in 2015 and another year,

90
00:05:17,391 --> 00:05:18,950
many civil war started.

91
00:05:30,020 --> 00:05:30,853
Okay?

92
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,590
Natural fortress.
When we think about Saudi Arabia,

93
00:05:34,591 --> 00:05:38,760
we think of a big desert with clean sand
dunes,

94
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:40,650
Yemen,
it's rather different.

95
00:05:40,651 --> 00:05:41,484
It is a country full of mountains,
almost as high as the rockies in the 

96
00:05:44,131 --> 00:05:48,240
United States.
Some peaks are higher than 3,600 meters.

97
00:05:52,230 --> 00:05:52,440
What if

98
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:56,970
this makes it really hard to transport a
big army no matter how well equipped us.

99
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,250
For instance,
the Saudis,

100
00:05:58,251 --> 00:06:01,730
they utilize a tank model called the m 
one abrams.

101
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:02,713
This is sort of like the BMW of tax.
Now imagine a convoy of these machines 

102
00:06:06,771 --> 00:06:09,710
crossing a path where they have to 
travel in singles,

103
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:13,633
you would just need a few guerrilla 
warriors with an RPG seven rocket 

104
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,084
launcher to destroy an entire battalion.
The RPG seven is a rocket launcher that 

105
00:06:21,201 --> 00:06:22,034
you can see on video games such as call 
of duty and it has a market price of 

106
00:06:24,921 --> 00:06:29,060
around 3000 US dollars.
The m one Abrams tank on the other hand,

107
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,530
cost around $6 million.

108
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:37,920
Wow.

109
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,890
Well,
not any that,

110
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:39,763
as we said at the start of this video,
the Saudi coalition has over 180 combat 

111
00:06:43,921 --> 00:06:44,754
jets and also American drones,
but there is a further problem here in 

112
00:06:49,051 --> 00:06:50,850
the landscape full of mountains and 
caves.

113
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,670
It really is easy to hide from these 
drones.

114
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:54,623
And also even the state of the art of 
radars can see in detail what's inside 

115
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:58,883
of the caves

116
00:07:04,530 --> 00:07:05,363
as of course the toothy warriors.
They know the battlefield like the back 

117
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:08,374
of their hands,
and they know where all the good hiding 

118
00:07:10,181 --> 00:07:11,470
places are.
In many cases,

119
00:07:11,471 --> 00:07:12,304
they can travel from one village to 
another without being exposed to any of 

120
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:15,694
the drone radars.
They can also hide their weapons inside 

121
00:07:18,190 --> 00:07:21,160
these caves bus that is still not all 
evenly.

122
00:07:21,161 --> 00:07:24,130
These gorillas that have no hummers or 
rather modern vehicles,

123
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:27,670
they have something better.
They have animals.

124
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,260
Oh yes,
you heard that right?

125
00:07:29,290 --> 00:07:30,123
In those high mounds in areas,
the least effective way to transport 

126
00:07:33,311 --> 00:07:36,010
something is by using donkeys or 
cameron.

127
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,500
So in other words,
the new way of tracking the movements of

128
00:07:42,501 --> 00:07:45,710
these guerrilla warriors is by having 
people behind the lines.

129
00:07:45,980 --> 00:07:46,813
Now we're not exactly talking double o 
seven like spies heritage rather than 

130
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:50,884
local citizens who are willing to help 
or soldiers who are close to enemy 

131
00:07:53,571 --> 00:07:54,800
lines.
All right,

132
00:07:54,801 --> 00:07:55,634
so even with these problems,
you might still be wondering how the 

133
00:07:58,671 --> 00:07:59,504
Saudis and getting basin the scale 
seemed to still be tips pretty far in 

134
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:04,260
Saudi Arabia's favor.

135
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:10,650
[inaudible]

136
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:13,370
eight demotivated army.
Now,

137
00:08:13,371 --> 00:08:14,204
many of you might think that the 
political system of the country has 

138
00:08:16,311 --> 00:08:19,830
nothing to do with the way they organize
their army and conducted.

139
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:20,773
Whoa.

140
00:08:22,530 --> 00:08:24,750
Well actually in a country like Saudi 
Arabia,

141
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:25,643
they all really connectors in an 
absolute monica like they have in Saudi 

142
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,650
Arabia.
The royal house cannot trust that army.

143
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:32,623
Then laying the obsession is keeping 
control over the entire military from 

144
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:39,630
the top all the way to the bottom.
This is why the decision making power is

145
00:08:39,631 --> 00:08:41,100
slower than in any other

146
00:08:41,210 --> 00:08:46,210
[inaudible].
Let's

147
00:08:48,490 --> 00:08:51,190
have a look at a hypothetical example 
here because it'll illustrate of assets.

148
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,233
Let's imagine a soldier discovers a 
machine gun nest that is a three beats 

149
00:08:55,551 --> 00:08:58,380
is out in western army such as the 
American or British one.

150
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:01,680
That soldier can easily ask for 
reinforcement by radio.

151
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:05,460
Usually he or she would go alongside 
with another soldier from the air force.

152
00:09:05,490 --> 00:09:09,120
You can give the exact coordinates to a 
pilot nearby and in a matter of minutes,

153
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:11,820
a combat jet is bombing the machine gun 
nest.

154
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:14,550
Now let's consider the Saudi Ami 
Festival.

155
00:09:14,551 --> 00:09:16,800
That soldier would have to tell the 
sergeants and that sergeant,

156
00:09:16,801 --> 00:09:19,920
we'd have to speak to someone higher up 
and at the time that decision has really

157
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:21,600
reached somebody who can actually make 
the decision.

158
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,553
It's been longer than an hour.
The 60 minutes here are the difference 

159
00:09:25,711 --> 00:09:29,620
between neutralizing and enemy position 
and using a soldier.

160
00:09:29,621 --> 00:09:30,454
Yeah.

161
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,620
Awesome.

162
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:38,430
The same goes for military training.
Most Saudi officials come from the royal

163
00:09:38,431 --> 00:09:42,350
houses and they didn't go through any 
sort of academic and military training.

164
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:45,780
Okay?

165
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:48,000
They got that position due to pure 
nepotism,

166
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,240
and this means,
well,

167
00:09:49,241 --> 00:09:50,074
a distinct lack of knowledge and skills.
The same goes for normal soldiers as 

168
00:09:53,521 --> 00:09:54,354
well.
As you probably know in most of these 

169
00:09:55,231 --> 00:09:56,064
oil monarchies,
most of the needs of citizens work as 

170
00:09:57,991 --> 00:09:58,824
civil servants with sky high salaries.
They really don't know anything about 

171
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:03,720
discipline or hard work.

172
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:04,973
Okay,

173
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,310
so let's look at an example.
In the video here,

174
00:10:08,311 --> 00:10:09,144
you can see that they don't even know 
how to protect the tank with infantry 

175
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,820
and don't forget that inside that tank 
it's very difficult to see the outside.

176
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:23,683
This is why a basic principle of war is 
that you always want to have soldiers 

177
00:10:27,051 --> 00:10:30,980
walking around the tank so that they can
see if something is firing upon it.

178
00:10:31,190 --> 00:10:34,280
This really is wall one o one.
Nevertheless,

179
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,360
the Saudis,
Ms. Dot.

180
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,194
Clawson.
This explains why it is so easy to 

181
00:10:37,791 --> 00:10:40,320
destroy their tanks with Sinatra.
Shiva weaponry.

182
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:46,940
How are we looking at this on the video?
Yeah,

183
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,910
you can see how someone gets close 
enough to a tank to put a bomb on it.

184
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,493
Oh,

185
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:55,573
hand behind.
Surprisingly that he's he rebels have a 

186
00:10:56,901 --> 00:11:00,920
much more western management system.
Small groups can react quickly.

187
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:01,754
Yams,
they do need to go all the way up 

188
00:11:03,111 --> 00:11:03,944
through the hierarchy.
Plus then motivation is way higher 

189
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:12,390
because they don't have the option of 
just retiring.

190
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:13,523
Arguably,
they are defending their home from a 

191
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,680
foreign army.
In summary,

192
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:17,543
the war on Yemen is a really excellent 
example of how strategy is more 

193
00:11:20,551 --> 00:11:21,384
important than weaponry and is that an 
authoritarian system makes for a less 

194
00:11:25,021 --> 00:11:25,600
efficient.

195
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,440
Oh,
nice.

196
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,893
Sadly,
the fact that the Saudis on losing this 

197
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:33,530
wall doesn't mean they're not killing 
people.

198
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,940
In fact,
the opposite,

199
00:11:35,170 --> 00:11:38,540
it's true hole in

200
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,540
Yemen conflict passes 10,000 
unfortunately,

201
00:11:41,541 --> 00:11:42,980
what could have been solved in a 
peaceful,

202
00:11:42,981 --> 00:11:43,814
democratic way?
It has become a war of attrition that 

203
00:11:45,351 --> 00:11:46,184
will leave a footprint on this country 
for generations to come and now the 

204
00:11:48,951 --> 00:11:49,850
question is,
Dean,

205
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,693
you think the Saudis can turn the table 
on this conflict or are we going to see 

206
00:11:53,591 --> 00:11:55,780
this conflict last for a long time to 
come?

207
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:58,660
