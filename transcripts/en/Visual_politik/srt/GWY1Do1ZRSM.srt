1
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,170
Have you ever heard of bill?
Just online threats from Baghdad?

2
00:00:11,171 --> 00:00:12,004
It seems probable that geography 
students will seem to have to learn the 

3
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:17,290
name of this capital city as well as its
new country,

4
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:20,680
and that would be a rocky Carter stock 
the 25th of December this year.

5
00:00:20,681 --> 00:00:21,514
What's the historical moments for the 
more than 5 million Kurds who currently 

6
00:00:24,341 --> 00:00:27,070
live in this autonomous community in the
north of Iraq?

7
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:31,730
Well,
why was this?

8
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,593
Well,
that's because of after decades of 

9
00:00:33,561 --> 00:00:35,780
unfulfilled promises and ethnic 
repression,

10
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:36,643
they have the opportunity to vote in a 
referendum organized by the regional 

11
00:00:39,651 --> 00:00:44,180
governments of Kurdistan since 2005 and 
according to the constitution of Iran,

12
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,170
Kurdistan is an autonomous region.
Despite it being an autonomous region,

13
00:00:48,171 --> 00:00:52,190
though this place essentially works as 
it's own almost independent country,

14
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:53,113
and the result of this was that the 
population really wanted to be fully 

15
00:00:55,521 --> 00:00:56,354
independent.

16
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:01,673
The day of the referendum,
Kurds showed up on mass to the polling 

17
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,824
stations.
Even the speakers of mosques encouraged 

18
00:01:06,601 --> 00:01:08,310
voters to go to the polls.
Well,

19
00:01:08,311 --> 00:01:11,790
the final results showed the referendum 
was a complete success.

20
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:14,970
More than seven out of every 10 Kurds 
went to vote.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:18,360
That's almost 3.1 million voters.
The victory.

22
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:19,223
Well,
it was overwhelming for those who 

23
00:01:20,051 --> 00:01:22,620
supported independence,
the movements it's obtained.

24
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:26,040
92.73% of the vote,
and you know what's what?

25
00:01:26,041 --> 00:01:26,874
This triumph.
That's totally understandable because 

26
00:01:28,351 --> 00:01:32,070
we're talking about some of the most ill
treated people in history.

27
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:35,670
They will treat it despite the fact that
the Kurds are recording to many experts,

28
00:01:35,671 --> 00:01:38,270
the most ancient people in this entire 
region.

29
00:01:42,710 --> 00:01:44,930
It is estimated that their culture,
their language,

30
00:01:44,931 --> 00:01:47,510
their rituals,
essentially everything that could define

31
00:01:47,511 --> 00:01:48,344
them have been in this part of the 
world's upper Mesopotamia for more than 

32
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:53,420
4,000 years.
In fact,

33
00:01:53,421 --> 00:01:56,380
many of these experts consider the city 
center of Erbil,

34
00:01:56,381 --> 00:01:57,214
the capital as the oldest human 
settlement to be continuously inhabited 

35
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:01,520
on the planet.

36
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:09,750
In other words,
the Kurds Zam bolder than the Persians,

37
00:02:09,751 --> 00:02:11,280
or indeed the Arabs.
However,

38
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,070
they have suffered from all kinds of 
persecution.

39
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,900
See,
the total number of kids is it rounds at

40
00:02:15,901 --> 00:02:18,810
30 million spread across mainly for 
countries,

41
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:19,800
Turkey,
Iran,

42
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,270
Syria,
and Iraq.

43
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,600
Well in all of these places,
the Kurds have suffered the consequences

44
00:02:24,601 --> 00:02:25,434
of nationalism,
which is trying to make them disappear 

45
00:02:27,231 --> 00:02:29,970
as a community.
They've tried to do ends their culture,

46
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:30,863
their language,
as well as trying to close down their 

47
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:33,384
media outlets.
Between 1986 and 1989 Saddam Hussein 

48
00:02:36,751 --> 00:02:37,584
launched the amf full campaign and 
estimation saw the between 50,002 

49
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:44,670
180,000 Kurds died.
As a result,

50
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:47,460
as you might imagine,
this cannot easily be forgotten.

51
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,500
My grandfather had a good sense of 
humor.

52
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:52,080
He used to say that he was born,
occurred in a free country.

53
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:54,390
Then the Ottomans arrived and said to my
grandfather,

54
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:56,460
your Ottoman,
at the fall of the Ottoman empire,

55
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,480
he became Turkish.

56
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,490
The church left and he became a gert.
Then the British arrived,

57
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:03,430
so my grandfather became a subject of 
his Gracious Majesty.

58
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,340
The British invented Iraq,
so my grandfather became Iraqi,

59
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:09,300
but to his dying breath,
he was never proud of being Iraqi in air

60
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:10,900
or saline.
My father's rifle,

61
00:03:10,990 --> 00:03:13,540
a childhood in Kurdistan.
Considering the history,

62
00:03:13,541 --> 00:03:14,374
it's no surprise that the Kurds once,
once and for all to make the dream of 

63
00:03:17,291 --> 00:03:20,420
having their own state come true.
And if we add up the facts,

64
00:03:20,421 --> 00:03:21,254
there's Iraqi had a stone is quite a 
rich area in terms of oil and natural 

65
00:03:23,981 --> 00:03:25,930
gas as well as fresh water.
By the way,

66
00:03:25,960 --> 00:03:28,750
we can understand even more why they 
want independence.

67
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,100
So just some of,
cause they wanted that right and country

68
00:03:31,101 --> 00:03:33,700
and say they held a referendum in order 
to do that.

69
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:39,820
The referendum,

70
00:03:43,020 --> 00:03:43,853
as we have said,
Kurdistan is almost an independent 

71
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,104
country already.
They even have their own army of more 

72
00:03:47,611 --> 00:03:48,444
than 200,000 soldiers.
This army is called the Peshmerga and 

73
00:03:51,730 --> 00:03:52,501
they've,
by the way,

74
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:55,050
he'd been the main defense to Islamic 
state in Iraq.

75
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:58,530
Do bear this in mind because the 
governments of Kurdistan is a close ally

76
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:59,510
of Washington.
Indeed,

77
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,580
it may be their most loyal ally in the 
region because of this,

78
00:04:02,581 --> 00:04:05,940
the u s has trained,
financed and well armed their army.

79
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:09,390
So I'm indeed even save that the Kurds 
are as pro American is the taxes.

80
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,560
So after many difficult years of intense
fighting against Islamic state,

81
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,423
it has been clear for the Kurds.
There are almost no advantages in 

82
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,604
remaining in Iraq and the governments 
have a bill took advantage of these 

83
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:29,190
battles in order to integrate curd areas
into that political space.

84
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,053
For example,
there is the province of Coco who has a 

85
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:35,910
majority of Kurds but was not within the
autonomous region of Kurdistan.

86
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,773
Go Cook is something of a crown jewel.
And one of the main reasons for the 

87
00:04:39,271 --> 00:04:41,730
conflict with the Iraqi government,
by the way,

88
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,850
as not hesitate to just send their 
troops over to recover the settlements.

89
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:48,870
Iraqi forces sweep into Kirkuk checking 
Kurdish independence drive.

90
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,390
So why is this territory so valuable?
Well,

91
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:52,253
that's because curt cook is the province
that contains the most Eileen Curtis 

92
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:56,340
start.
In fact,

93
00:04:56,341 --> 00:04:57,174
it's been estimated that around 10% of 
all Iraqi oil reserves are concentrated 

94
00:05:00,391 --> 00:05:02,730
here in car cooked and nobody wants to 
let

95
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:03,643
good

96
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:07,643
in 2007 a referendum.
It should have been conducted in order 

97
00:05:09,721 --> 00:05:13,200
to incorporate or not the autonomous 
region of Kurdistan.

98
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:17,250
The voting in never took place.
So when the peshmerga occupying the city

99
00:05:17,251 --> 00:05:19,080
in order to protect it from Islamic 
state,

100
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,750
since the Iraqi army had literally run 
away,

101
00:05:21,751 --> 00:05:24,780
the curd governments had facto annexed 
the territory.

102
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:25,673
So with these conditions and with the 
constant negotiations between Baghdad 

103
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:32,670
and beale men's with a growing 
disconnect between both territories,

104
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:33,563
they eventually got the referendum.
This is the first time in history that 

105
00:05:37,471 --> 00:05:40,110
the people of Kurdistan will freely 
decide their future.

106
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,003
After that,
we will start talks with Baghdad to 

107
00:05:42,331 --> 00:05:44,880
reach an agreement over borders,
water and oil.

108
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:47,610
Mister Barzani,
president of Iraqi Kurdistan,

109
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,533
now the governments of Iraq at post this
referendum in every way as a 

110
00:05:51,841 --> 00:05:52,674
constitutional court of Iraq,
even our Lord is parliaments asked for 

111
00:05:55,261 --> 00:05:56,094
many things,
including the withdrawal of 

112
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,333
representation in our bill.
Lee bought a clothes and even army 

113
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:01,574
deployments in Kirkuk.
There was also the prosecution of 

114
00:06:03,681 --> 00:06:05,510
organizers of the referendum,
and it's,

115
00:06:05,511 --> 00:06:07,610
of course,
parliament tried their best to remain in

116
00:06:07,611 --> 00:06:10,730
control of all of the oil.
But even with this kind of action by the

117
00:06:10,731 --> 00:06:13,160
Iraqi government to the Kurds,
they didn't really care.

118
00:06:17,620 --> 00:06:18,453
Okay.

119
00:06:18,670 --> 00:06:21,940
That's the only logical because despite 
the progress of the Iraqi army,

120
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,000
the risk for Kurdistan is probably not 
in Iraq,

121
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:27,310
but rather with the international 
community,

122
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,173
you see Turkey and Iran,
they don't even want to hear about an 

123
00:06:30,671 --> 00:06:31,504
independent Kurdistan.
That's because it might give the Kurds 

124
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:36,610
in their territory is the idea that they
can replicate this success.

125
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:37,483
So lucky for instance,
there's been at war with the Kurds for 

126
00:06:38,771 --> 00:06:41,140
decades,
but that's a story for another day.

127
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,003
The thing is that these countries have 
allied with Iraq in order to defy the 

128
00:06:45,821 --> 00:06:46,654
referendum.
Turkey's military has confirmed that 

129
00:06:49,271 --> 00:06:50,104
Turkey and Iraq will conduct a joint 
military drills in Turkey along an area 

130
00:06:53,291 --> 00:06:55,870
bordering Iraq,
semi autonomous Kurdish region.

131
00:06:56,020 --> 00:06:56,853
Iran's semiofficial,
I s n a news agency reported on Sunday 

132
00:07:00,790 --> 00:07:03,070
that the Supreme National Security 
Council,

133
00:07:03,071 --> 00:07:03,904
a closed Iranian airspace to the Iraqi 
Kurdish area at the request of the 

134
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:10,330
central government in Baghdad and 
there's no way,

135
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,910
it's not just about the possibility of 
conflicts after all,

136
00:07:12,911 --> 00:07:15,040
this is likely to be the result of fear 
tactics,

137
00:07:15,041 --> 00:07:18,340
which are very usual in this kind of 
situation and they rarely work.

138
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,173
By the way.
Remember Kurdistan is a close ally of 

139
00:07:20,651 --> 00:07:24,070
the USA and they haven't experienced and
well trained army?

140
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:24,953
No.
The bigger issue here might be that 

141
00:07:25,871 --> 00:07:26,704
Kurdistan they need then neighbors this 
territory it's landlocked and as they 

142
00:07:30,311 --> 00:07:33,790
are very dependent on Turkey both in 
order to export their oil,

143
00:07:33,791 --> 00:07:36,100
Dan to import anything that they might 
meet,

144
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,963
so a trade blockade,
it would be a serious threat for this 

145
00:07:39,761 --> 00:07:40,594
territory.
The KRG is economy depends on one 

146
00:07:43,661 --> 00:07:44,494
pipeline that sells oil to international
markets and that pipeline goes through 

147
00:07:47,591 --> 00:07:49,510
Turkey.
You shut down that pipeline,

148
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:50,373
you choke the Kurdish economy.
Bilal Wahab analysts at the Washington 

149
00:07:53,411 --> 00:07:54,244
Institute for Near East Policy Bounce 
there is more to it than just their 

150
00:07:56,961 --> 00:07:57,794
neighbors.
Nobody wants any more tension with this 

151
00:07:59,351 --> 00:08:01,570
part of the world.
Internationally speaking,

152
00:08:01,571 --> 00:08:02,404
the referendum didn't get much support.
The U S as opposed to it and Antonio 

153
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:06,543
Guitars,
secretary general of the UN has 

154
00:08:07,541 --> 00:08:08,374
described it as dangerous and 
potentially disruptive and today Israel 

155
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:13,420
is the only country that supports 
independence.

156
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:15,610
So this might mean the future is not 
looking very good.

157
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:17,290
Right.
Well wait just a second because it's,

158
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:18,124
despite all of this,
it is very likely the Kurdistan will 

159
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:21,640
achieve independence,
you know,

160
00:08:21,641 --> 00:08:22,474
or later.

161
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:36,310
The reasons for a new country,
Iraqi Kurdistan,

162
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,820
it's got many issues.
However,

163
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,330
they have managed to become the region 
that functions the best in Iraq.

164
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,290
They are the safest and wealthiest area.
I've been to Iraqi,

165
00:08:45,291 --> 00:08:46,124
Kurdistan and number of times it's safer
than Kansas if you're coming from 

166
00:08:49,041 --> 00:08:51,680
Baghdad or muscle.
It's practically Switzerland.

167
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:54,830
Michael J totten American journalists.
Check this out.

168
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:55,723
In 2014 before the irs offensive,
this region was turning into the most 

169
00:08:58,711 --> 00:09:02,020
relevant financial and tourist spot in 
Iraq and oasis.

170
00:09:02,050 --> 00:09:04,770
Many businessmen,
both local and foreign skyscrapers,

171
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:07,770
moles and mentions where it's spreading 
like mushrooms after the rain.

172
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,190
That was until Walbro broke out in Iraq 
against the Islamic state.

173
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:13,060
Then most of this development,
it's empty.

174
00:09:13,061 --> 00:09:16,980
You have to stop now,
often an awful few years of walk in 2017

175
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:17,843
the numbers at bouncing back.
And do you remember that this area is 

176
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:20,844
oil rich?
Some estimations calculate the oil 

177
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,350
reserves of Kurdistan at 45 billion 
barrels,

178
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:26,213
but this into words,
Kurdistan would be among the 15 oil 

179
00:09:28,681 --> 00:09:29,514
richest countries on earth,
and this isn't a country with this or 

180
00:09:32,221 --> 00:09:36,870
more than 5 million inhabitants,
but there's still so much more it rugs.

181
00:09:36,870 --> 00:09:39,270
Kurdistan is quite business friendly.
Indeed.

182
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:40,133
They like private initiatives.
Something uncommon in this part of the 

183
00:09:42,391 --> 00:09:43,224
globe.
The taxes are also attractive and 

184
00:09:44,341 --> 00:09:45,174
bureaucracy is not excessive either.
Unfortunately though there is still 

185
00:09:48,121 --> 00:09:48,954
plenty of corruption.
The Kurdistan government will do its 

186
00:09:51,241 --> 00:09:54,240
best to help the private sector and have
them invest here.

187
00:09:54,270 --> 00:09:55,103
I invite all local and foreign investors
here to take advantage of our laws and 

188
00:09:58,591 --> 00:10:02,730
offers and invest Masoud Barzani,
president of Iraqi Kurdistan.

189
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:06,180
The thing is that this region has enough
going for it to make a Kurdistan,

190
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:08,160
a prosperous country.
Their first,

191
00:10:08,161 --> 00:10:08,994
our lambs,
high levels of safety and natural 

192
00:10:10,561 --> 00:10:13,260
resources,
whether they're geographical location is

193
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:15,330
beneficial.
It's a place between Turkey,

194
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:16,860
Iran,
and Iraq.

195
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:19,050
But on top of all of that,
this new country,

196
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,860
it's only,
well there because people then,

197
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,703
especially Iraqi Kurds had been deported
attacks with chemical weapons and have 

198
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:29,580
suffered all sorts of social engineering
in order to strangle their culture.

199
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,473
And now they have an opportunity to 
build their own country for the rest of 

200
00:10:33,511 --> 00:10:34,344
us.
Could also benefits from a more 

201
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:35,934
moderate,
prosperous and to free country than the 

202
00:10:37,561 --> 00:10:40,740
ones around it in the Middle East would 
certainly be better for us.

203
00:10:40,770 --> 00:10:43,470
So now we've got to consider the 
problems in Iraqi Kurdistan.

204
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:44,340
I mean,
first of all,

205
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:45,120
oh,
they're ready.

206
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:45,960
Well,
yes,

207
00:10:45,961 --> 00:10:46,794
absolutely.
But that's no excuse to not make this 

208
00:10:48,571 --> 00:10:52,500
new country happen first because these 
problems exist now with them still being

209
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,334
a part of Iraq and seconds because they 
are less serious than the ones in the 

210
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:58,170
rest of the country.
So what about corruption?

211
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,460
Yes,
it's totally there.

212
00:10:59,461 --> 00:11:01,650
And is there oil dependency also?
Yes.

213
00:11:01,651 --> 00:11:02,760
And what about debt?
Well,

214
00:11:02,761 --> 00:11:04,260
yes,
there is that too.

215
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:08,280
But this is totally normal in this part 
of the wells because the rest of Iraq is

216
00:11:08,281 --> 00:11:09,780
in a much worse situation.

217
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:12,000
Well anyway,
we just wished that bag Dan's a response

218
00:11:12,001 --> 00:11:14,700
does not turn the situation into a 
military conflicts.

219
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:17,250
That would be a terrible scenario for 
everyone.

220
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:18,213
Indeed,
it would be a situation where political 

221
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:22,260
interests prevail above the interests of
the people,

222
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:23,094
but now it's time for your opinion.
Do you support the idea of the 

223
00:11:25,441 --> 00:11:27,150
independence of Kurdistan?
Well,

224
00:11:27,151 --> 00:11:27,984

We've got the queen of England,
Vladimir Air Putin.

237
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:01,870
There's just two people on the world 
central.

238
00:12:01,871 --> 00:12:04,150
It's got Ilan musk coming up,
Arnold Schwarzenegger,

239
