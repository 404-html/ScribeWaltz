1
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,373
I want to start with a question.
What would you do if you had 

2
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:13,930
$250,000,000,000,000?
I'm sure there are many things you would

3
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:14,764
do with that sort of money,
but what if I told you those 

4
00:00:15,970 --> 00:00:18,790
$250,000,000,000,000 worth from 
Zimbabwe?

5
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:19,683
Well,
that's a totally different question 

6
00:00:20,711 --> 00:00:21,544
because in 2015 and 250 trillion,
Zimbabwe and dollars were worth the 

7
00:00:25,811 --> 00:00:28,530
equivalent of one us scholar.
Yep.

8
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:30,400
You heard that?
Absolutely right.

9
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:33,550
The truth is the Zimbabwe is like 
Venezuela,

10
00:00:33,580 --> 00:00:35,620
but on a massive scale,

11
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:43,990
this country has suffered the worst 
hyperinflation of all time.

12
00:00:44,110 --> 00:00:44,943
Since more or less than year,
2000 prices were rising higher and 

13
00:00:47,921 --> 00:00:50,920
higher as an absolutely mind boggling 
rates.

14
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:51,813
In 2008,
a piece of bread was worth 10,000 

15
00:00:54,101 --> 00:00:56,410
Zimbabwean dollars and name.
Are you wondering,

16
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,060
well,
how did it all of this happened?

17
00:00:58,210 --> 00:00:59,740
Now the answer,
it's pretty simple.

18
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:03,010
One day he told his finance minister,
dude,

19
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:05,560
I don't care how you do it,
but man,

20
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:08,390
we need money.
And what did the finance minister today?

21
00:01:08,530 --> 00:01:09,363
Well,
he just pressed the money printing 

22
00:01:10,511 --> 00:01:13,840
button like there was no tomorrow,
so in conclusion,

23
00:01:13,841 --> 00:01:17,710
Zimbabwe had to get rid of their own 
national currency and led to the economy

24
00:01:17,711 --> 00:01:21,400
be dominated by foreign currencies,
especially the American dollar.

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:27,363
All of this was a little while ago.
So what exactly is going on in Zimbabwe 

26
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:30,820
now?
Well,

27
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:33,460
in recent days,
and we're recording this in 2017,

28
00:01:33,461 --> 00:01:34,294
the country appeared on the news because
of Acute Atar that spells the end of 

29
00:01:37,690 --> 00:01:40,750
mcgarvey 37 year long dictatorship.
And yes,

30
00:01:40,751 --> 00:01:44,710
my difference of visual politic,
we must say that Cuda tiles are not what

31
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:45,544
they used to be.
This was what we could call the direct 

32
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,210
version of acute.
It's,

33
00:01:48,211 --> 00:01:49,300
ah,
just have a look at.

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:50,183
Yes,

35
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:54,863
bobby,
to get $10,000,000 payoff and immunity 

36
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:02,220
for his family and this sort of thing 
better described as a soap opera.

37
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:03,143
Regard it as 93 years old wanted to 
dominion power and he also wanted his 

38
00:02:06,251 --> 00:02:09,460
wife who's 52 years old to inherit the 
presidency.

39
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:10,323
You know,
this sort of thing that can only happen 

40
00:02:10,901 --> 00:02:11,734
in countries like Argentina and North 
Korea or perhaps the national front in 

41
00:02:14,591 --> 00:02:16,600
France.
So as you can imagine,

42
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,434
a lot of people did not agree with this.
So the IRB clans sent all of them and 

43
00:02:20,710 --> 00:02:21,543
physical opponents out of the country.
This is what happened in the beginning 

44
00:02:23,921 --> 00:02:24,754
of November 2017 when they kicked out 
the vice presidents and this guy has a 

45
00:02:27,371 --> 00:02:29,560
really difficult to pronounce his name.
I looked it up.

46
00:02:29,590 --> 00:02:32,470
I still can't pronounce it properly,
but his name is Emerson Minim,

47
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,780
Guam.
So yes,

48
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:35,980
sorry if I butcher the pronunciation of 
his name in this one,

49
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,720
the army's reaction to this was 
immediate and well,

50
00:02:43,721 --> 00:02:44,554
you probably know the rest of the story,
but now the is about Zimbabwe's future 

51
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,253
of many is managua.
The new mcgarvey is this man Abel to 

52
00:02:51,371 --> 00:02:52,510
resurrect Zimbabwe's.
Yeah.

53
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:57,410
Economy.
Well,

54
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:59,500
we are going to answer those questions,
but we do.

55
00:02:59,530 --> 00:03:04,530
Let's take a look back at the history.
Thousand defect.

56
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:08,463
Yes,
you Zimbabwe's economy is a total 

57
00:03:10,721 --> 00:03:13,000
disaster.
I know what you're thinking.

58
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,780
If you make a cocktail where you mix 
dictatorship and Africa,

59
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:19,470
what you guess is corruption and policy,
right?

60
00:03:19,550 --> 00:03:20,383
Yeah,

61
00:03:23,490 --> 00:03:24,323
kinds of right,
but probably not as much as you might 

62
00:03:25,621 --> 00:03:26,371
think.
In fact,

63
00:03:26,371 --> 00:03:27,204
there was a time where Zimbabwe was 
known as the African Jew that that's 

64
00:03:29,701 --> 00:03:30,534
also allowed this country to become was 
a whole continents bond and now you 

65
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:33,751
might be wondering,
well,

66
00:03:33,751 --> 00:03:36,000
what happens when a country with so many
natural resources,

67
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,010
so many rich lands,
so many gold mines.

68
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:40,680
What caused it to become such a 
catastrophe?

69
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:41,491
Well,
we owned that.

70
00:03:41,491 --> 00:03:44,280
It definitely has a name and that name 
is Robert Magaldi.

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,390
Zimbabwe has been an independent country
for some 37 years.

72
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:50,730
Thirty seven years is the amount of time
that the Gabi has been empowered.

73
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,170
The decolonial colonialization process 
of the so called itself Rhodesia British

74
00:03:55,171 --> 00:03:57,490
colony,
and that in a 15 years old

75
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:58,960
for war

76
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,183
I'm hands,
we had the white minority that made up 

77
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,360
just five percent of the population.
Despite what you might think.

78
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,970
They didn't have the support of western 
powers.

79
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,923
They declared their independence 
unilaterally and therefore no other 

80
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:14,920
countries supported them.
On the other hand,

81
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:17,360
you have the guerrilla troops led by 
Robin [inaudible],

82
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,333
the man who combined anti imperialist 
nationalism with a hardcore communist 

83
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,050
you.
Back then,

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:23,913
Margaret Thatcher was the prime minister
and you might now be thinking cold war 

85
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:28,943
plastic communist leader plus longer.
It sounds like a pretty explosive 

86
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,210
combination,
right?

87
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,580
Well,

88
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,760
oh,
absolutely wrong.

89
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,653
Back then the UK,
his priority was to let that former 

90
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:43,084
colonies become healthy democracies,
and this is why I thought Joe has self 

91
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:46,983
signed,
the peace agreements with the Zimbabwe 

92
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:50,980
and guerrilla fighters and organized 
elections in the country.

93
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,370
These elections were as fast as they 
could be given that the country had just

94
00:04:54,371 --> 00:04:57,310
ended a civil war and had good real 
warriors all over the place.

95
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:59,050
Who won the election?
Well,

96
00:04:59,051 --> 00:05:01,720
of course it's rather than Garvey.
So now you might be wondering,

97
00:05:01,721 --> 00:05:02,554
well,
did macaby cheats in the selection or 

98
00:05:03,611 --> 00:05:04,630
was it a fair victory?
Well,

99
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:07,180
the evidence actually suggests that yes,
he had the support in.

100
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,320
Yes,
he did genuinely

101
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,950
see among the majority of the black 
population in Zimbabwe,

102
00:05:17,951 --> 00:05:22,570
there are two major ethnic groups who 
make up 80 percent of the population.

103
00:05:22,690 --> 00:05:26,440
And then you have the mat of billy who 
had just 10 percent rather than the Gabi

104
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:29,350
belongs to the owner group.
And this is why it's no surprise that he

105
00:05:29,351 --> 00:05:31,780
wants 60 percent of the votes.
So in 1980,

106
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:32,614
the UK granted independence to Rhodesia 
and this is how Zimbabwe became a 

107
00:05:36,131 --> 00:05:41,110
sovereign country with new Gabi as the 
presidents during the first seven years,

108
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:44,830
he basically grabbed all of the power 
and in terms of the economy,

109
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:47,030
at least we've got to admit that things 
actually work.

110
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:47,893
So

111
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:53,130
in the beginning they'll be

112
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:57,860
respected the property rights of the 
white population,

113
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:58,723
both in a very Venezuelan fashion.
He spends all of the savings from the 

114
00:06:01,401 --> 00:06:04,940
colonial times where we have to admit 
that although it didn't work in the long

115
00:06:04,941 --> 00:06:05,774
run regarding,
did achieve a greater goal and his role 

116
00:06:07,761 --> 00:06:10,550
is in Bob way achieved the highest 
literacy rate in Africa.

117
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:13,220
Ninety percent of Zimbabweans can read 
and write.

118
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:15,920
So if you've got your dictatorial to do 
list in front of you,

119
00:06:15,921 --> 00:06:17,160
well what's the next thing on that?
Well,

120
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:20,650
that's to get rid of the opposition in 
this chapter of his life.

121
00:06:20,651 --> 00:06:21,484
He did not save a penny.
He sends the fifth garrison of his army 

122
00:06:24,011 --> 00:06:24,844
to North Korea so that he could learn 
about state of the art methods for 

123
00:06:27,461 --> 00:06:32,461
oppression,
and when those soldiers came back,

124
00:06:34,921 --> 00:06:36,750
he pretty much said to them,
alright guys,

125
00:06:36,751 --> 00:06:38,790
now go get rid of these now to bally's 
wiped them out.

126
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:39,723
This is how the [inaudible] started.
Greco Hindi means in the language early 

127
00:06:43,531 --> 00:06:44,364
rain,
the cleans the straws by the inside 

128
00:06:45,541 --> 00:06:47,610
before the spring rain comes.
Yup.

129
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:50,730
Shown as they are pretty poetic,
despite the printed name.

130
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:54,520
This was an ethnic cleansing that was 
done pretty much as the manual describes

131
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,940
and the more than 20,000 people died,

132
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:05,420
and with this regarding gained a great 
deal of political stability.

133
00:07:05,421 --> 00:07:07,430
Forehead killed all of his political 
foes.

134
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,670
That's in the year 2000 things.
They really changed,

135
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:13,970
not yet decided to start an agricultural
revolution.

136
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:14,804
And the style of Chairman Mao,
it was a real revolution and everything 

137
00:07:18,411 --> 00:07:19,244
changed for the West.
Gabi decided that the best lands 

138
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:24,260
shouldn't be owned by the white 
minority.

139
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,140
So we,
he expropriated that land and gave it to

140
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:30,710
surprise surprise his ministers and 
political allies.

141
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:32,990
However,
he only gave them the lines he could not

142
00:07:32,991 --> 00:07:34,420
give them the knowledge to,
tends it,

143
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:38,600
so production fell sharply while 
hyperinflation destroyed the rest of the

144
00:07:38,601 --> 00:07:39,830
industries.
Since then,

145
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:42,440
Zimbabwe has pretty much been a living 
hell.

146
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:46,763
Time of the crocodiles,
crocodiles wait beneath the water just 

147
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,080
showing their eyes and their nostrils 
until the victim appears.

148
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,540
Then they open their doors and they eat 
them.

149
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:58,090
This is why the new president of 
Zimbabwe,

150
00:07:58,310 --> 00:07:59,143
men,
Angola,

151
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,183
is known as the Crocodile Mountain.
Galois was one of those leaders during 

152
00:08:03,911 --> 00:08:07,190
the civil war and he has been a minister
since 1980,

153
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:10,780
so he spent all of his life waiting 
under the shadow of the dictator.

154
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:14,370
That moment has finally come so far 
after this cue,

155
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,450
his first steps,
they've been very risky.

156
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:17,500
Here is an example,

157
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:24,980
Bob Wade,
leaders cabinet heavy on military ruling

158
00:08:24,981 --> 00:08:27,130
party,
but this is not enough as in Bob Way and

159
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:29,870
he still has a lot of work.
It has been one of the biggest steps,

160
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:30,980
has already been taken

161
00:08:33,520 --> 00:08:34,353
government a bent in digitization law 
with the indigenization law is another 

162
00:08:38,231 --> 00:08:41,170
economic policy made by Magog.
In this case,

163
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,780
he said bigger companies couldn't belong
to white people.

164
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,733
As you can imagine,
the white minority that used to live in 

165
00:08:46,361 --> 00:08:47,194
the country has already integrated.
They used to be five percent of the 

166
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:52,030
population.
They are now just one set,

167
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,980
but now the crocodile wants foreign 
investments and rejecting because of his

168
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:57,003
race,
doesn't seem like a brilliant economic 

169
00:08:58,471 --> 00:09:03,471
idea.
Wait just a minute,

170
00:09:04,071 --> 00:09:04,904
because despite all of that,
so the new president of Zimbabwe might 

171
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:10,270
not be the right man for the job.
In a country like this,

172
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,133
it's easy to find dark spots on a 
politician who served such a crazy 

173
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:15,394
dictator.
And guess what crocodile did in the 19 

174
00:09:17,711 --> 00:09:18,544
eighties?

175
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:21,970
Yes.

176
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,060
He was the minister of national 
security.

177
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:25,953
So he would have had something to do 
with that genocide that we mentioned 

178
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,193
earlier,
and being the person who executed the 

179
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:34,990
genocide doesn't exactly make you a 
prime person to run a country.

180
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,883
So the question is,
that probably pops into your mind right 

181
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:40,600
now is really someone who can become a 
true opposition to this regime,

182
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:43,480
and the answer is absolutely yes.
In 2008,

183
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:46,780
there was a political party called 
Movement for Democratic Change,

184
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:49,810
and surprisingly they beat me in those 
elections.

185
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:51,370
Yes,
you totally had that.

186
00:09:51,371 --> 00:09:53,620
Right,
and in a dictatorship like Zimbabwe,

187
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:54,483
this meant a big time political crisis 
and we've all been simply couldn't 

188
00:09:57,611 --> 00:10:00,220
destroy a political opponents.
You had such political capital.

189
00:10:05,890 --> 00:10:08,700
On the other hand,
he also couldn't let him win and finally

190
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:10,330
regard,
but he came up with a solution.

191
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,850
He would remain the presidents,
but he would let his opponents,

192
00:10:12,851 --> 00:10:13,990
Morgan Stanley,
right?

193
00:10:14,010 --> 00:10:15,700
They come to the prime minister.
Of course,

194
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:18,190
this prime minister remained in power,
but just four years,

195
00:10:18,191 --> 00:10:21,880
and during those four years,
this Bob way started using the US dollar

196
00:10:21,881 --> 00:10:25,120
as an official currency after the 
collapse of that local one,

197
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:28,030
but becomes free.
It still remains in dire straits

198
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,190
ways.
Unemployment rate at 90 percent.

199
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,263
This is why it's finger.
Ryan has lost a lot of political 

200
00:10:37,981 --> 00:10:38,814
capital,
so it does seem that in the next 

201
00:10:39,931 --> 00:10:40,764
election the crocodile has all of the 
chances to win besides the army is also 

202
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:46,810
going to control the process and the 
army sports,

203
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:47,663
the crocodile.
One thing must be sad here and that is 

204
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:49,944
whoever leads this country next,
we'll have a great advantage for it is 

205
00:10:53,221 --> 00:10:56,000
impossible to do a worse job than their 
predecessors.

206
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,713
So now the question becomes,
do you think the crocodile will be able 

207
00:11:05,971 --> 00:11:09,720
to take Zimbabwe back and make it an 
African jewel once again,

208
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,120
or do you think he's going to turn into 
the next Mugabi?

209
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:12,983
