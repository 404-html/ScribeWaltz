1
00:00:07,510 --> 00:00:08,343
The global competency lab is a region 
with 12 countries that have just one 

2
00:00:11,691 --> 00:00:13,700
thing in common and that's that they all
hate each other.

3
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:14,683
For decades,
most of these countries were a big part 

4
00:00:16,971 --> 00:00:17,804
of a federation called Yugoslavia,
which had a socialist system very 

5
00:00:21,201 --> 00:00:26,201
similar to that of the Soviet Union.
After the fall of communism,

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,553
the Yugoslavian estate broke apart and 
all the regions separated from each 

7
00:00:34,891 --> 00:00:35,724
other in the most violent way possible,
either about my age or slightly older 

8
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,594
you might remember the terrible bulk and
was a showcase of the worst part of the 

9
00:00:43,441 --> 00:00:44,274
human condition.
As all of this happens just a few 

10
00:00:46,290 --> 00:00:48,510
kilometers away from Italy and from 
Greece,

11
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,590
so while the rest of Europe enjoyed a 
comfortable and peaceful existence,

12
00:00:52,710 --> 00:00:55,230
this region's inhabitants were killing 
each other.

13
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:58,833
Since then,
the Balkans in one of Europe's poorest 

14
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:03,820
regions.
Some people call it the Bermuda triangle

15
00:01:03,821 --> 00:01:04,654
of economics because when someone 
invests that money mysteriously 

16
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:08,854
disappears.
Probably new country like Albania is a 

17
00:01:10,421 --> 00:01:11,254
bit like traveling 50 years in the past.
Other countries like Serbia or growing 

18
00:01:14,651 --> 00:01:15,484
fairly fast lately,
but there are still miles away from 

19
00:01:17,111 --> 00:01:21,900
being able to join the European Union.
Greece,

20
00:01:21,901 --> 00:01:25,650
which is the best boy in the classroom,
is bankrupt and has an unemployment rate

21
00:01:25,651 --> 00:01:26,484
of 21 percent and otherwise this doesn't
look like a good country for doing 

22
00:01:29,791 --> 00:01:30,840
business.
Right?

23
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:32,580
Well,
give you A.

24
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,450
China thinks it is.

25
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,393
Yes.

26
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:36,143
China is putting billions of pounds 
worth of investment into Greece and 

27
00:01:39,091 --> 00:01:39,924
other Balkan countries to create a new 
silk road from the Mediterranean into 

28
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:44,730
the heart.
The European Union,

29
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,120
we aren't talking about almost 
$20,000,000,000.

30
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:48,983
This is the same cost as hosting the 
Olympic Games and it's all in a region 

31
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:54,360
where nobody else seems to invest a 
penny.

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:55,253
China is bought harbor and is now 
building brand new railroads that will 

33
00:01:58,081 --> 00:01:58,914
connect to the Balkans with Budapest in 
Hungary and that might ended up in 

34
00:02:01,951 --> 00:02:03,630
Germany,
but not only that,

35
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,780
the Chinese government is paving the way
for private investments.

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:07,673
Can you imagine Chinese factories on the
outskirts of Belgrade and Alley Express 

37
00:02:11,101 --> 00:02:12,930
logistics center in the middle of 
Athens?

38
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:13,793
Bob,
this might be a reality sooner than you 

39
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:15,800
might have

40
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:16,633
facts

41
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:20,733
for better understanding.
If we look at it relative to that 

42
00:02:22,381 --> 00:02:23,214
population,
China is showing a bigger interest in 

43
00:02:25,211 --> 00:02:28,150
Greece,
Australia than it is in Germany,

44
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,990
so now the question is why is China so 
interested in the Balkans?

45
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:33,270
Isn't this a poor,
corrupt,

46
00:02:33,271 --> 00:02:36,880
and business unfriendly region?
What is China trying to achieve here?

47
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:37,863
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

48
00:02:38,771 --> 00:02:39,604
these questions,
but as usual before we do a second look 

49
00:02:41,711 --> 00:02:46,711
back at the history tree for sale in the
year 2010,

50
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,644
Greece started that budget cuts.
The whole country was bankrupt and the 

51
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,220
European Union agreed to bail them out 
with money from it's wealthiest members.

52
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:00,253
Boss can exchange.
The Greek government was supposed to 

53
00:03:01,941 --> 00:03:04,310
control that spending.
Since then,

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:08,230
Greece has gone through all kinds of 
political and financial crisis.

55
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:10,340
Unemployment Sims,
he doesn't stop growing.

56
00:03:10,341 --> 00:03:13,520
It's now at more than 20 percent since 
poverty is on the rise too,

57
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:14,473
for a better understanding.
Greek public desk is almost twice that 

58
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,193
of their entire gross domestic product,
and on top of all of this grease seems 

59
00:03:22,011 --> 00:03:23,840
to be allergic to business,
ev,

60
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:25,430
rampant corruption,
red tape,

61
00:03:25,431 --> 00:03:26,264
and all kinds of laws that have created 
a country with almost no major 

62
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:30,344
companies.

63
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,113
Brussels demands is that the government 
of Alexis Tsipras make reforms and sell 

64
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,253
the state owned companies,
but there was a big problem here being 

65
00:03:41,110 --> 00:03:41,943
in the situation that they were.
Nobody wanted to buy the Greek 

66
00:03:44,231 --> 00:03:45,064
governments property,
so they simply had to drop their prices 

67
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,120
to rock bottom.
In other words,

68
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,350
Greece was and still is in a desperate 
situation now,

69
00:03:53,351 --> 00:03:56,530
guests,
you can smell desperation from miles and

70
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:57,520
miles away.
Yup.

71
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,443
That would be China.

72
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:05,700
China's costco acquires 51 percent stake
in pirates passport.

73
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:06,653
When this deal,
China was killing two birds with one 

74
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:09,690
stone.
On the one hand,

75
00:04:09,691 --> 00:04:10,524
it's one of their companies was buying 
one of the main ports in the 

76
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:13,134
Mediterranean seat on the other.
The government of Xi Jinping with his 

77
00:04:15,631 --> 00:04:16,464
commitments to investing at 3 billion 
more dollars in the country was buying 

78
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:22,560
it from this angle ally in sight,
the EU and.

79
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:22,921
Yes.
Yes,

80
00:04:22,921 --> 00:04:24,360
yes.
I know what you'll now thinking.

81
00:04:24,361 --> 00:04:25,194
The Greek presidents,
Alexis suppressed the European left 

82
00:04:27,721 --> 00:04:28,554
Rockstar,
the man who would never sell his 

83
00:04:30,031 --> 00:04:30,864
principles to an evil rich guy.
No matter how much money was put on the 

84
00:04:32,971 --> 00:04:33,880
table.
Yeah,

85
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:34,743
yeah.
We need that.

86
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:42,930
Breeze blocks used criticism at UN of 
China's human rights record.

87
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,033
Greece has vetoed a European Union 
condemnation of China's human rights 

88
00:04:48,061 --> 00:04:51,540
record at the UN infuriating diplomats 
and rights organizations.

89
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,860
You said the move undermine that used 
position as a defender of human,

90
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:55,933
right?

91
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,753
Just a minute,
because this is not only about politics 

92
00:05:03,861 --> 00:05:06,590
here.
Let's take a look at it from an economic

93
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:07,520
perspective.
Now,

94
00:05:07,521 --> 00:05:11,060
a Chinese company controls one of the 
biggest ports in Europe.

95
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:11,953
This means Chinese businesses will find 
it easier than ever to reload their 

96
00:05:14,451 --> 00:05:17,590
products into one of the wealthiest 
markets on the planet.

97
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,960
Europe,
but still has a little problem here from

98
00:05:20,961 --> 00:05:22,640
the Pi report.
Berlin,

99
00:05:22,641 --> 00:05:26,870
we have more than 2000,
300 kilometers of distance on the way.

100
00:05:26,871 --> 00:05:30,560
We have poor countries with poor roads 
and poor railways,

101
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:34,520
but hold on just a second day because 
China has already thought of this.

102
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,790
Do you remember the one belt?
One road projects.

103
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,240
This is brands.
New Silk Road,

104
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,600
Xi Jinping wants to create.
This is a network of infrastructure that

105
00:05:41,601 --> 00:05:42,434
is meant to connect the entire wells and
in Europe the silkroad will go through 

106
00:05:46,161 --> 00:05:46,994
the Balkans.

107
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:52,110
Oh,
great.

108
00:05:52,110 --> 00:05:54,750
Budapest railway construction starts at 
the same time.

109
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:58,850
Chinese consulting companies are working
to renovate railroads between Greece and

110
00:05:58,851 --> 00:05:59,684
Macedonia.
The goal is to be able to have one 

111
00:06:01,161 --> 00:06:01,994
shipment,
Madigan pirates and crossing the whole 

112
00:06:03,561 --> 00:06:06,800
Balkan peninsula at a hundred and 60 
kilometers an hour,

113
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:09,870
and all of this is cheaper to build here
than intercity.

114
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,030
I mean,
think about it.

115
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,960
The vulcans have cheap land,
cheap salaries and their governments are

116
00:06:14,961 --> 00:06:17,300
welcoming this Chinese money with open 
arms.

117
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:18,223
As we said at the beginning,
the Balkans still feel a bit like the 

118
00:06:20,031 --> 00:06:25,031
aftermath of the wars from the 19th.
Let me see sooner like Bill Craig,

119
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:29,450
you can still see the ruins from the 
NATO bombings in 1999.

120
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,433
A country like Montenegro doesn't even 
have a railroad that connects it with 

121
00:06:32,961 --> 00:06:35,570
Bosnia or Croatia despite sharing a 
border.

122
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,430
Don't forget that except for Greece and 
Coratia,

123
00:06:38,570 --> 00:06:39,403
none of these countries are you members.
This means that they hardly get any 

124
00:06:41,991 --> 00:06:44,930
Brussels money to rebuild,
so these Chinese loans,

125
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,060
$70 from heaven speak about this with 
European countries.

126
00:06:52,271 --> 00:06:53,560
They say,
why China?

127
00:06:53,830 --> 00:06:55,660
Because they have the money to be 
honest.

128
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:57,100
Zerana,
Z,

129
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,130
Milosevic,
Serbian minister of transportation,

130
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:03,670
but hold on just a second here because 
this is not the end of the story.

131
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:05,980
What if China wants to go even further?

132
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:13,060
Trainees,
factories in Europe,

133
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:14,043
we'll know it.
China started grabbing thanks to the 

134
00:07:15,461 --> 00:07:18,790
foreign companies that set up in these 
special economic science,

135
00:07:18,791 --> 00:07:19,624
but the truth is the real appeal of 
China during the nineties was the lower 

136
00:07:22,301 --> 00:07:24,910
wages,
however things they've now changed.

137
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:25,823
Take a look at this chart today.
The average salary in a city like 

138
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:32,404
Shanghai is almost the same as that in 
Greece and almost double that of the 

139
00:07:35,261 --> 00:07:37,950
Saudi and salary.
This means for a Chinese company,

140
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,800
Sedia is something close to what Shen 
Zen used to be for an American.

141
00:07:41,860 --> 00:07:42,693
There's also the fact that said the 
uneducation is relatively good and 

142
00:07:45,281 --> 00:07:47,560
they're close to Germany in summary,
cheap labor,

143
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,453
well educated population,
and it's close to one of the world's 

144
00:07:50,231 --> 00:07:55,231
most appealing markets.
This is an unexplored paradise.

145
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,980
China's Habib signs agreement to buy 
serving steel plant.

146
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,993
Of course,
this news is from 2016 and we still 

147
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:05,934
don't have that many examples,
but that aren't enough cases to show a 

148
00:08:09,241 --> 00:08:10,074
clear trends.
Chinese companies want to start 

149
00:08:11,761 --> 00:08:13,710
manufacturing things in Europe and the 
Balkans.

150
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:16,500
Other perfect place to do that.
Most specifically.

151
00:08:16,650 --> 00:08:19,200
Then looking at Sandia,
this explains why this year,

152
00:08:19,210 --> 00:08:20,043
Xi Jinping himself paid a visit to 
Belgrade or why Huawei has already 

153
00:08:23,671 --> 00:08:26,580
invested at a fortune to improved 
telecommunications in the country.

154
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,290
Last year,
that's 2017.

155
00:08:28,291 --> 00:08:30,840
The Bank of China opens their first 
Serbian officers.

156
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,870
So in a way we could say that the 
relationship between these two countries

157
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:35,430
where it really couldn't be any better 
right now,

158
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:41,200
but I can probably guess what you're 
thinking right now.

159
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,034
I mean very rarely a visual politic.
Do we tell you that corruption is a 

160
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,560
friend of foreign investments and when 
it comes to corruption,

161
00:08:47,570 --> 00:08:50,920
sedia certainly starts to look less like
a paradise,

162
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,190
but make no mistake.
Chinese companies are experts in dealing

163
00:08:54,191 --> 00:08:54,930
with this.
In fact,

164
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,380
Chinese businessmen are quite 
comfortable in hostile environments.

165
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,243
They have demonstrated this when they 
built those textile factories in 

166
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:02,700
Ethiopia,
and let's be honest here,

167
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:07,250
China itself isn't exactly a haven of 
transparency and democracy either.

168
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:11,603
Meanwhile,
as soon as investment came to the 

169
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:14,580
Balkans,
the regions fondness for Europe,

170
00:09:14,581 --> 00:09:15,414
it started going down in 2012.
Seventy percent of Serbs wanted to join 

171
00:09:18,361 --> 00:09:19,194
the European Union.
Some people were even willing to change 

172
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,500
that alphabet.
To do that.

173
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:23,513
As you probably know,
Serbian is a Slavic language and it's 

174
00:09:25,381 --> 00:09:26,214
written in cyrillic characters.
Some intellectuals wanted to change it 

175
00:09:28,561 --> 00:09:31,150
to a Latin alphabet is the same way you 
Croatians dips,

176
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:31,830
but now,
well,

177
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,460
this love of Europe,
it's dropped to 35 percent at the end of

178
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,230
the day with money flowing into China.
Well,

179
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,290
he really wants Brussels funding.
In past presidential elections,

180
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,080
none of the main candidates talked about
joining the European Union.

181
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,033
Nevertheless,
nobody in Brussels seemed to be too 

182
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:46,224
worried about that.
You said only China has been capable of 

183
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:53,390
finding business opportunities in this 
part of the world.

184
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:57,200
The rest of Europe still sees this as a 
political and economic desert.

185
00:09:57,290 --> 00:09:59,030
The same happens in many parts of 
Africa.

186
00:09:59,031 --> 00:09:59,864
When nobody dead to invest,
all of a sudden Beijing money came in 

187
00:10:02,630 --> 00:10:05,810
and now some of these countries are 
growing like this note.

188
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:11,663
So the question is now where we see an 
awakening in the Balkans is the same 

189
00:10:13,501 --> 00:10:14,334
way.
We've seen it in some African countries 

190
00:10:15,610 --> 00:10:18,270
and he could grease Saudi and perhaps 
even Bosnia.

191
00:10:18,271 --> 00:10:21,630
They come a brand new industrial cluster
for Chinese companies.

192
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:22,583
