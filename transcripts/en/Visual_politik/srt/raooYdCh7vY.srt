00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible]

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:09,873
China has started in what has been the 
greatest economic revolution in the 

3
00:00:13,811 --> 00:00:15,250
history of mankind.
However,

4
00:00:15,251 --> 00:00:19,690
in spite of this in 2017 both Moody's 
and standard and Poor's,

5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:24,520
two of the three main rating agencies 
reduced the Chinese debt rating.

6
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:31,863
Brits pause.
The International Monetary Fund itself 

7
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,670
has been issuing warnings about this for
months.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,890
Yet the Chinese economy is growing 
strongly,

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,400
but that does not mean everything is 
going well.

10
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:43,240
In fact,
not at all.

11
00:00:43,240 --> 00:00:44,073
In recent years as we've already 
discussed in a video that are linked to 

12
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,364
you at the end,
China's economy has seen one parameter 

13
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:54,900
saw exponentially and that's corporate 
debt and this isn't small news.

14
00:00:56,261 --> 00:01:00,400
Chinese corporate debt accounts for 
almost 170% of China's GDP.

15
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:06,960
To give you an idea of what this means,
we could say that this 170% GDP level is

16
00:01:08,111 --> 00:01:10,800
one of the highest on the planet and is 
a,

17
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:13,480
for example,
twice that of the United States.

18
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:23,720
Some of you might be wondering,
well,

19
00:01:23,721 --> 00:01:26,390
if the Chinese economy seems to be doing
so well,

20
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:29,660
how did its companies accumulate such a 
huge debt?

21
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:31,520
Well,
the truth is that in recent years,

22
00:01:31,521 --> 00:01:34,700
Chinese companies have gone on a sort of
spending spree.

23
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:35,563
You all over the world,
they've bought everything foreign 

24
00:01:37,491 --> 00:01:38,690
companies,
ports,

25
00:01:38,691 --> 00:01:39,650
airports,
minds,

26
00:01:39,651 --> 00:01:41,540
railways,
even soccer teams,

27
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,960
[inaudible]

28
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:52,900
knees invasion seemed unstoppable.
And then that's precisely what caused to

29
00:01:52,901 --> 00:01:53,734
so many countries do develop an 
aggressive discourse against this kind 

30
00:01:57,311 --> 00:01:58,960
of occupation.
And not only that,

31
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:03,190
as the Chinese have begun investing in 
the poorest countries in Africa,

32
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,053
many analysts,
journalists and activists have accused 

33
00:02:06,431 --> 00:02:09,700
Beijing of practicing this sort of 
colonialism.

34
00:02:12,910 --> 00:02:13,150
Do

35
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:13,983
beware,
because this phenomenon is really quite 

36
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:16,240
widespread.
Companies,

37
00:02:16,241 --> 00:02:17,380
investors,
entrepreneurs,

38
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:20,470
government institutions,
it does not matter.

39
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:21,363
In recent years,
the obsession to get money out of China 

40
00:02:23,291 --> 00:02:27,760
has been shared practically the only 
every person in the Chinese economy now.

41
00:02:27,761 --> 00:02:29,860
So all these,
some of the might now be thinking,

42
00:02:29,861 --> 00:02:30,694
well,
Chinese people buying all kinds of 

43
00:02:31,541 --> 00:02:33,850
things are important over the world.
People in Beijing,

44
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,560
they've got to be rubbing their hands 
together.

45
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,400
Right?
Well,

46
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,233
the truth is that no,
actually nothing could be further from 

47
00:02:39,671 --> 00:02:40,570
the truth.
In fact,

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,433
throughout the last year,
Xi Jinping's government has launched 

49
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:46,220
many measures to stop this process.
Oh,

50
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:47,170
well,
I'm just a moment.

51
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,013
And the Beijing government actually 
wants to stop this Chinese purchase 

52
00:02:50,621 --> 00:02:51,170
wave.
I mean,

53
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:53,200
protecting,
they're wanting to take over the world.

54
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,660
Well,
it's not that they don't want to,

55
00:02:55,750 --> 00:02:58,750
but they certainly do have their reasons
for this.

56
00:02:58,751 --> 00:02:59,740
So listen up.

57
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,583
Yeah.

58
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,720
Other face of Chinese investment we 
mentioned we want to invest abroad.

59
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:15,400
As you can imagine,
we can do it in many different ways.

60
00:03:15,401 --> 00:03:16,234
For example,
we can buy debt from a foreign 

61
00:03:17,921 --> 00:03:19,330
government,
from a foreign company,

62
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:20,223
from a foreign bank.
We can also buy shares in another 

63
00:03:22,691 --> 00:03:23,830
country,
stock markets,

64
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:24,723
but we can also carry out what is known 
as foreign direct investment that is by 

65
00:03:29,861 --> 00:03:31,510
a local company,
opened a store,

66
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,860
a factory,
oh workshop,

67
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,150
et Cetera,
et cetera.

68
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:37,960
In other words,
invest in a real asset in field.

69
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,083
Oh,

70
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,013
we gotta sneak a direct foreign 
investment implies a greater degree of 

71
00:03:45,601 --> 00:03:47,910
complexity,
certainly greater risk,

72
00:03:47,911 --> 00:03:51,720
which is why it's expected to generate 
greater profitability.

73
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:53,250
Of course,
if it wants,

74
00:03:53,251 --> 00:03:55,680
there would be no incentive to implement
them.

75
00:03:55,770 --> 00:03:56,603
After all,
it's infinitely easier to buy financial 

76
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,110
assets while sitting in front of a 
computer at the office,

77
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,570
or even just in your pajamas hunting 
them.

78
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,463
Well,
the fact is that paradoxically is this 

79
00:04:05,731 --> 00:04:07,620
type of investment has grown in recent 
years.

80
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,454
It's profitability has actually 
plummeted according to China's stinked 

81
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,830
currency administration.
The rate of return,

82
00:04:13,831 --> 00:04:18,831
this type of investments profitability 
dropped to barely 0.4% in 2016 oh.

83
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:24,510
Despite the fact that almost every stock
market was skyrocketing.

84
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:29,913
Therefore,
in spite of the colonial isn't 

85
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:31,983
accusations.
The truth is that many of the Chinese 

86
00:04:33,701 --> 00:04:36,160
investment projects off working so 
badly,

87
00:04:36,161 --> 00:04:39,010
but that more of a headache than a 
business of the century.

88
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:41,570
No.

89
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:42,770
Before you might be thinking,
well,

90
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,030
hold off a minute,
Simon,

91
00:04:44,031 --> 00:04:45,920
I mean,
what exactly is the problem here?

92
00:04:45,921 --> 00:04:48,470
Is it simply that that dress making too 
little money?

93
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,333
Well,
according to what we learned about 

94
00:04:51,021 --> 00:04:52,550
corporate desk,
yeah,

95
00:04:52,551 --> 00:04:53,384
it is a large part of this huge 
international expansion was financed 

96
00:04:56,391 --> 00:04:57,870
with debt data.
That,

97
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:58,843
of course must be repaid with interest.
And if the investments fail or don't 

98
00:05:01,821 --> 00:05:05,870
generate the expected returns,
it could create a huge solvency problem,

99
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,250
which would obviously seriously affect 
the Chinese financial system,

100
00:05:10,251 --> 00:05:12,350
which belongs fundamentally to the 
government.

101
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,173
Take for example,
v Signer Hydro and China Railway 

102
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:21,194
Engineering Corporation,
case to engineering and construction 

103
00:05:23,511 --> 00:05:25,790
companies owned by the Chinese 
government.

104
00:05:25,830 --> 00:05:26,663
You see,
in 2007 they reached a huge agreements 

105
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:30,163
with the Congolese government in 
exchange for a concession to exploit 

106
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:33,584
copper.
Are they committed to investing $9 

107
00:05:36,290 --> 00:05:38,540
billion in the African country,
3 billion in the mine,

108
00:05:38,541 --> 00:05:39,374
and 6 billion in infrastructure to 
government owned companies that had 

109
00:05:42,201 --> 00:05:43,034
nothing to do with mining and we're 
entirely financed by a Chinese 

110
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,450
government owned.

111
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:52,540
Thank you.
These

112
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,183
Chinese companies have already invested 
more than $2 billion and so far 

113
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:59,340
everything's been a problem.
The price of copper fell.

114
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:00,174
The reserves went as big as expected.
The logistical costs were really high 

115
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:06,170
because they hadn't even guaranteed that
power supply.

116
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:09,440
And of course all of this man's many 
costs and many,

117
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,303
many delays.
Only nine years later in 2016 were they 

118
00:06:13,281 --> 00:06:17,390
able to start extracting copper in much 
lower quantities and then extract it?

119
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:18,283
So whatever the future holds.
The reality is that during the last 

120
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:22,730
decades,
this agreements was a big headache,

121
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:27,790
is a great sauce of losses.
And don't think that this project was an

122
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:31,280
exception.
The truth is that in recent years,

123
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:34,090
Chinese companies government owns,
and it's private companies alike,

124
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,033
I've gotten into serious debt,
buying all kinds of assets without 

125
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:39,470
caring about the price.

126
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,090
That is not all.
In addition,

127
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:44,953
all these investments,
I mean capital leaving the country at 

128
00:06:46,981 --> 00:06:47,814
such a high rate,
the between 2011 and the beginning of 

129
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:55,091
2017 Chinese currency reserves plummeted
by $1 trillion.

130
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,653
And that my friends is a lot of money.
And it's something that goes in the 

131
00:06:59,241 --> 00:07:00,074
opposite direction of what Beijing one 
switch in recent years trying to 

132
00:07:02,781 --> 00:07:03,614
strengthen the yuan.
So now we come to the question of why 

133
00:07:05,931 --> 00:07:09,260
are Chinese investors suit eager to get 
money out of the country?

134
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:13,550
Why do they seem so surprisingly bad 
when it comes to investing abroad?

135
00:07:13,610 --> 00:07:14,750
Well,
listen up.

136
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,160
Yep.

137
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:22,360
Bad incentive.

138
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,270
Sorry.

139
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,103
So the fact that Chinese investors seems
so in competent when it comes to 

140
00:07:28,331 --> 00:07:32,040
investing abroad is a matter of 
incentives and to be a rocker a,

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:36,480
see the main priority for the Chinese 
who managed to make money is to transfer

142
00:07:36,510 --> 00:07:38,440
part of birth,
their assets abroad.

143
00:07:38,470 --> 00:07:39,970
So why is this?
Well,

144
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:42,440
it's fundamentally a matter of legal.

145
00:07:43,710 --> 00:07:44,543
Hello

146
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:47,500
me to explain.
As you know,

147
00:07:47,501 --> 00:07:51,730
China is a dictatorship and that means 
that if tomorrow you have a problem with

148
00:07:51,731 --> 00:07:54,390
the political power,
your money could just disappear.

149
00:07:54,490 --> 00:07:56,860
And not only that,
as in any dictatorship,

150
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,550
there are many restrictions because if 
things go wrong,

151
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,413
what could be better?
And having part of your patron any 

152
00:08:02,741 --> 00:08:05,680
protected in other countries,
it seems pretty sensible rights.

153
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,230
I think most people would do it.
I mean,

154
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:13,600
yeah.
Well that's

155
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:14,433
one of the explanations for why so many 
Chinese businessmen wanted to invest 

156
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:18,364
their money as quickly as possible,
even if it meant paying a premium may 

157
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:24,070
sort of surcharge.
But that isn't the only reason.

158
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:24,963
Additionally,
in recent years since 2008 the Chinese 

159
00:08:26,831 --> 00:08:27,664
government promoted easy and cheap 
credit has a mechanism to boost the 

160
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:31,114
economy and of course when you can get 
into death under such favorable 

161
00:08:33,521 --> 00:08:34,354
conditions,
you wouldn't be as demanding when 

162
00:08:35,871 --> 00:08:38,560
selecting which projects to invest in.
Yes,

163
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:42,160
this is one of the big problems with 
expansive monetary policies.

164
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,023
They encourage bad investments that 
later aren't really difficult to pay 

165
00:08:45,581 --> 00:08:47,000
off,
but hold on a moment.

166
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:50,370
The entity is most responsible for the 
huge slab of corporate dads to this.

167
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:52,510
We've talked about have not been private
companies.

168
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,790
That's actually one's owned by the 
state.

169
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,880
And this though surprising also has a 
lot to do with incentives.

170
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,273
See investing outside of the country in 
large amounts men's cause that managers 

171
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:16,084
could puff up their chests before the 
Beijing government view to the growth 

172
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:21,280
that that companies had achieved.
On the other hand,

173
00:09:21,281 --> 00:09:23,410
it meant many of these managers cause 
can move on.

174
00:09:23,411 --> 00:09:26,170
So you ran another country and charged a
lot of money.

175
00:09:26,230 --> 00:09:29,920
Let's say that their interests are 
different from those of their company.

176
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,820
Of course if business was done in 
countries as complicated as Africa,

177
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:44,630
it was also easier to take a slice gets 
a commission,

178
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:45,970
shall we say.
In addition,

179
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:46,853
Chinese state owned companies have huge 
bureaucratic structures which makes 

180
00:09:49,971 --> 00:09:54,080
decision making and adapting to any 
changes that may occur very,

181
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:55,080
very slow.
Yup.

182
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:58,630
State owned companies tends to be much 
more inefficient.

183
00:09:58,650 --> 00:09:59,483
While that's what's CG Peng wants to 
face up to while trying to consolidate 

184
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:03,133
his power.
Dangerous Game [inaudible] this huge 

185
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:16,234
shopping mal strum,
which is often done without too much 

186
00:10:18,521 --> 00:10:23,200
thought also happens in Japan in the 
1980s that is before the Greek crisis of

187
00:10:23,201 --> 00:10:26,620
the early nineties and in Beijing.
They're terrified that something similar

188
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:29,590
will happen to them.
So what do you think they did well,

189
00:10:29,650 --> 00:10:30,483
the introduced a lot of restrictions on 
foreign investments in such a way that 

190
00:10:33,221 --> 00:10:34,054
now the Chinese government can veto 
corporate operations abroad for Chinese 

191
00:10:37,001 --> 00:10:39,820
companies even if they are carried out 
by private companies.

192
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,953
Yes,

193
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,083
this has a double intention because in 
addition to cooling the foreign 

194
00:10:45,581 --> 00:10:49,060
investment process,
it also strongly reinforces Xi Jinping's

195
00:10:49,061 --> 00:10:49,894
political power.
Let's see that with this excuse the 

196
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,234
Chinese government has taken and 
enormous mechanism out of its sleeve to 

197
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:57,580
reward friends and to punish the less 
loyal.

198
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:01,930
In addition with the excuse of 
increasing control,

199
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:05,290
Beijing is also promoting the merging of
government owned companies,

200
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:06,143
which until now works autonomously to 
create huge corporations and this gives 

201
00:11:10,391 --> 00:11:12,340
Beijing even more power.
Of course,

202
00:11:12,341 --> 00:11:15,280
all these actions can weigh on the 
growth of Chinese companies.

203
00:11:15,281 --> 00:11:16,114
They can decrease competition and 
increase the bureaucracy in efficiency 

204
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:22,270
with which the Chinese public sector 
operates.

205
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:26,200
But yes,
Xi Jingping we'll get even more power.

206
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:34,650
China has many strengths but this is one
of its great weaknesses.

207
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,543
Even so Chinese savings are so high that
it seems difficult to reproduce a 

208
00:11:39,001 --> 00:11:42,090
financial crisis like the one the Japan 
experienced,

209
00:11:42,091 --> 00:11:45,280
but the risk certainly does exist.
That was your turn.

210
00:11:45,281 --> 00:11:49,020
Do you think that Xi Jinping's ambitions
well ends up hurting China?

211
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:49,913
