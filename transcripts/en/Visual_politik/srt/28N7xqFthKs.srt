1
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:11,540
California is one of the states with the
highest taxes in all of America.

2
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,000
There's also one of the most expensive 
places to live.

3
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,953
If this wasn't bad enough,
the California and government is never 

4
00:00:17,541 --> 00:00:22,541
ending risk of bankruptcy with a brutal 
amounts of debt and to launch fiscal,

5
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:27,523
but despite all of this,
California is home to the third richest 

6
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:34,340
and most prosperous region on the 
planet.

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,750
Yes,
dear viewers,

8
00:00:35,751 --> 00:00:36,584
of course,
I'm talking about the Santa Clara 

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:39,530
Valley.
What do you say?

10
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:40,610
You've never heard of it?
Well,

11
00:00:40,611 --> 00:00:41,444
actually I have because it's better 
known by its own official name of 

12
00:00:45,201 --> 00:00:46,034
Silicon Valley.
This is the place where companies like 

13
00:00:48,381 --> 00:00:49,220
Google,
apple,

14
00:00:49,221 --> 00:00:54,221
and facebook were all born in total.
Thirty nine of the 100 biggest companies

15
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:58,700
in the entire world have their 
headquarters in this place,

16
00:00:58,820 --> 00:00:59,653
but make no mistake.
Silicon valley is not a big metropolis 

17
00:01:02,331 --> 00:01:04,670
like New York City or London.
In fact,

18
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:05,820
the opposite.
Okay.

19
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:06,670
Straight

20
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,093
cities like Cupertino,
Palo Alto and mountain view have a 

21
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:15,940
little more than 60,000
inhabitants.

22
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:19,870
Menlo Park where facebook headquarters 
are located as a smaller population than

23
00:01:19,871 --> 00:01:22,720
a small town in Kansas,
but in this region,

24
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:25,900
the average salary,
so policy is $10,000

25
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:29,910
a month and it's home to many of the 
world's largest billionaires.

26
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:32,440
And if you're wondering,
the answer is no.

27
00:01:32,441 --> 00:01:36,460
There is no silicon mine in the Santa 
Clara Valley whatsoever.

28
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:37,473
In fact,
the name Silicon Valley was coined in 

29
00:01:38,531 --> 00:01:39,364
the 19 seventies because this is when 
microchips and semiconductors made out 

30
00:01:43,031 --> 00:01:44,340
of silicon manufacturer.

31
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,353
Sure.

32
00:01:49,510 --> 00:01:50,343
Don't go looking for any natural 
resources in this part of the world 

33
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,404
because you won't find any.
So now we come to the real question of 

34
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,330
why here?
I mean,

35
00:01:58,390 --> 00:01:59,223
what's so special about this area?
Why not northern California or why not 

36
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,010
New York or Chicago or any other place 
for that matter?

37
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,370
That was easy to understand why 
somewhere like Switzerland is so rich,

38
00:02:09,371 --> 00:02:10,204
they have low taxes and an excellent 
political system than Saudi Arabia and 

39
00:02:13,691 --> 00:02:14,524
they're rich because they've got oil.
The silicon valley is very different 

40
00:02:16,391 --> 00:02:19,450
from those places and it's very 
different from other places in America.

41
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:20,343
For one,
it's got those high taxes we mentioned 

42
00:02:21,461 --> 00:02:23,320
and believe me,
the taxes are really,

43
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,580
really high.

44
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:29,030
For example,
imagine that you a top executive and you

45
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:32,120
make half a million bucks a year.
If you lived in Texas,

46
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:35,180
you'd pay around 32 percent in income 
tax.

47
00:02:36,490 --> 00:02:37,670
Yeah.

48
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,510
However,
in California you would pay 42 percent.

49
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,940
As you can see,
the difference is meaningful.

50
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:46,023
So again,
why Silicon Valley and North Texas or 

51
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:49,353
Delaware or Nevada,
what makes this region quite so special 

52
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:55,410
for startup,
and even more importantly than that,

53
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:56,263
well,
what is a start up and how is created 

54
00:02:58,120 --> 00:03:00,970
well in today's we're going to answer 
all of those questions,

55
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:03,640
but before we do,
let's have a look back at the history.

56
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:09,153
The trader is there all times in history
when several coincidences happen all at 

57
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,840
once and this,
this is the miracle of cylinder.

58
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,113
Our story starts in the year 1956 with a
company called Shockley semiconductor 

59
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:21,984
lab.
They were the first company in the 

60
00:03:23,611 --> 00:03:26,290
valley to manufacturers silicon based 
micro jets.

61
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:29,730
Their offices were in a little village 
with no more than 7,000

62
00:03:29,731 --> 00:03:30,564
inhabitants.
This was a village called mountain view 

63
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,370
located on the outskirts of San 
Francisco.

64
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,640
Back then,
nobody talked about silicon valley,

65
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:43,503
but of course the San Francisco 
Peninsula was one of the tech capitals 

66
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,753
of America night.
It's actually the radon is used by the 

67
00:03:48,941 --> 00:03:52,060
army were manufactured by a company that
you might have heard of,

68
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:53,710
Hewlett Packard.
Further,

69
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,603
Stanford University generated skilled 
professionals ready to work in rocket 

70
00:03:58,001 --> 00:03:59,850
science,
but let's get back to art.

71
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:00,693
Friends are shopping.
They were the most advanced company in 

72
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:05,680
their fields and perhaps this company 
could have gone very,

73
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:07,000
very far.
Bonds,

74
00:04:07,001 --> 00:04:07,834
they had a big problem,
apparently people in the company who 

75
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:11,610
felt that their boss was a bit of a

76
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,573
Dick,

77
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,480
and so what happens?
Well,

78
00:04:17,481 --> 00:04:19,310
one day,
eight of the youngest work isn't.

79
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:23,200
The company went to Mr Shockley his 
office and essentially said Shockley,

80
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:27,080
you could take your stupid ass company 
and stick it up your ass.

81
00:04:27,081 --> 00:04:29,000
We're the ones who designed your 
technology.

82
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,930
We're the brains of this business,
so we're going to get outta here,

83
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:35,990
start our own business and kick ass 
without you.

84
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,883
These eight,
and then became known as the traitorous 

85
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:41,360
eight.
Their average age was 30,

86
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:42,283
they had no money whatsoever and they 
wanted to start a state of the art 

87
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:49,721
technology company that required a lot 
of investments and you might be thinking

88
00:04:52,271 --> 00:04:52,841
now,
well,

89
00:04:52,841 --> 00:04:57,250
which banks lend the money and the 
answer to that is absolutely not.

90
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:58,353
However,
pay attention here because this was the 

91
00:05:00,191 --> 00:05:03,730
beginning of something really,
really big in 1959,

92
00:05:03,731 --> 00:05:05,770
the first venture capital funded 
company.

93
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,733
It was born,
but hold on a second year because I do 

94
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:09,970
want to explain what that actually 
means.

95
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,940
You have an idea since the beginning of 
capitalism,

96
00:05:16,941 --> 00:05:17,774
there have been people with money 
willing to partner with people who had 

97
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,020
ideas and together they started 
companies.

98
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:25,560
Nonetheless.
After World War Two,

99
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,473
lots of soldiers came home from the 
battlefields and one out of every two 

100
00:05:29,421 --> 00:05:31,280
veterans they wanted to start a company

101
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,440
and

102
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:39,540
all of a sudden there was a spike in 
demand for financing.

103
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:40,583
This is why many of the people with 
money started rethinking the way that 

104
00:05:43,230 --> 00:05:45,510
businesses use to work.
For instance,

105
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:48,990
there's Laurance Rockefeller from the 
famous Rockefeller family.

106
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:51,900
This man had something more than lots of
money.

107
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:56,990
He also knew other people who had money,
so essentially one day in 1959,

108
00:05:57,591 --> 00:06:00,380
he called them all up and said,
listen up ditch chops,

109
00:06:00,381 --> 00:06:03,320
put down your champagne glasses and your
caviar for a second,

110
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,154
the shy and your monocle and pay 
attention because I just found eight 

111
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:10,160
guys in California who have a great 
business idea that very,

112
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,994
very clever and they want to develop 
some weird stuff with lots of 

113
00:06:14,061 --> 00:06:14,894
technology.
It's got silicone and other things I 

114
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:19,790
don't understand,
but if you fancy this idea,

115
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:22,610
give me your money invested in said 
business,

116
00:06:22,611 --> 00:06:26,240
and if it all goes well,
will become even richer than we are now.

117
00:06:26,241 --> 00:06:27,074
Pip,
pip,

118
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:32,380
and say it wasn't was sad,
so it was done.

119
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,410
This is how in 1959,
the traitorous eight from Silicon Valley

120
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:38,283
started fairchild semiconductors with 
the money from Rockefeller and his 

121
00:06:41,690 --> 00:06:44,080
billionaire friends.
This was the first time.

122
00:06:44,081 --> 00:06:44,914
It wasn't just one rich dude investing,
but a collective society of rich dudes 

123
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:50,920
instead,
and this.

124
00:06:51,070 --> 00:06:51,903
This is how the first venture capital 
fund called Venn rock associated was 

125
00:06:55,421 --> 00:06:56,254
born,
and guess where they have their 

126
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:59,350
headquarters.
Of course,

127
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:01,900
that's Palo Alto.
This was silicon,

128
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:07,183
so this was a really risky idea and 
that's why these funds are call of 

129
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:11,630
venture capital funds.
I mean,

130
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:14,030
if you put your money into a big company
like Coca Cola,

131
00:07:14,031 --> 00:07:16,760
you'll lose or win a little bit of 
money,

132
00:07:16,761 --> 00:07:19,790
but it's really hard to go fully 
bankrupt nonetheless,

133
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:24,380
giving money to a guy with nothing but 
an idea that's a pretty risky Joel.

134
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,240
So well,
what's the advantage?

135
00:07:29,241 --> 00:07:31,660
Then?
Of course it's that if it goes right,

136
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:35,420
you get stupidly rich and so then we 
have to answer the question,

137
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:37,640
well,
what's the secret of success?

138
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,480
Of course you do want to invest in lots 
of different companies at the same time.

139
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:45,860
You need just one out of 10 to be 
successful to make it worthwhile.

140
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,783
And the truth is that Rockefeller and 
his other fellows made a hell of an 

141
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:50,270
investment.
Actually,

142
00:07:50,271 --> 00:07:54,950
the company still exists today and has 
offices all over the world,

143
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:58,820
and so what happens when one person gets
stupidly rich by doing something?

144
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,653
Well,
a lot of copycats spring up out of the 

145
00:08:01,671 --> 00:08:03,740
blue trying to do the same thing by the 
year.

146
00:08:03,741 --> 00:08:04,574
Nineteen 82.
There were already 12 vc funds in 

147
00:08:07,551 --> 00:08:09,110
silicon valley,
their philosophy,

148
00:08:09,290 --> 00:08:12,200
it was simple,
get private money from investors,

149
00:08:12,201 --> 00:08:13,034
pension plans,
and of course all those rich dudes and 

150
00:08:15,051 --> 00:08:15,884
then a team of specialized professionals
meet entrepreneurs and startups looking 

151
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,570
for good ideas.
In summary,

152
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:23,870
silicon valley has an old car of guys 
who study at Stanford.

153
00:08:23,871 --> 00:08:25,760
Clever guys.
You study somewhere else,

154
00:08:25,761 --> 00:08:27,950
but eventually emigrated till the 
valley.

155
00:08:28,010 --> 00:08:31,030
A network of companies that make it easy
to start any business.

156
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,800
Of course,
a ton of money.

157
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:34,461
All right.
All right,

158
00:08:34,461 --> 00:08:35,294
so this all sounds pretty cool,
but what does a Silicon Valley company 

159
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:39,343
actually look like?
How does this startup system and VC 

160
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,250
funds actually work?
Well,

161
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,330
let's have a look.
Shall We?

162
00:08:48,030 --> 00:08:50,870
Silicon Valley way.
I know I know the word stars.

163
00:08:50,871 --> 00:08:51,704
I'm has already become another buzzword 
that stupid people used to sound 

164
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:55,080
smarter.
So then.

165
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,093
Well,
what is the difference between a normal 

166
00:08:57,301 --> 00:08:59,220
company and a startup?
Well,

167
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:04,520
here's a good definition.
It is a company designed to grow fast.

168
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,253
Paul Graham,
founder of Yahoo Store and venture 

169
00:09:10,601 --> 00:09:11,950
capital investor.
All right,

170
00:09:11,951 --> 00:09:13,780
so now I can probably guess what you're 
thinking.

171
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:16,030
I mean,
company is designed to grow fast.

172
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:20,290
Well actually no,
just look at Ikea is a good example.

173
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:23,710
Ikea is one of the most successful 
companies of all time,

174
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:27,220
but his main principles since the 
beginning has been to grow only with its

175
00:09:27,221 --> 00:09:29,890
own funds.
No debt from banks or hedge fund

176
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,290
that unlike other companies,
Ikea took a long time to grow,

177
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:39,990
but he was healthy,
consistent growth.

178
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:43,530
So now the question still remains.
What is a startup?

179
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,110
Well,
facebook would be a great example here.

180
00:09:46,230 --> 00:09:47,280
Why?
First of all,

181
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,143
because it's a scalable business.
This means it doesn't matter if they 

182
00:09:50,971 --> 00:09:55,200
have one or a million uses.
The spending is almost the same,

183
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:56,153
but not only that.
Facebook is the perfect example of what 

184
00:09:57,931 --> 00:10:02,180
we know as the startup financing cycle 
and pay attention here because this.

185
00:10:02,181 --> 00:10:05,040
This is really key in understanding how 
silicon valley

186
00:10:05,690 --> 00:10:06,523
wow

187
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,630
first step is what we know as the valley
of death.

188
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,050
Why is it called this?
Well,

189
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,310
because this is the stage when most 
projects don't survive.

190
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:18,930
In the case of facebook,
we have our friends,

191
00:10:18,931 --> 00:10:22,800
Mark Zuckerberg and Edwardo Savrin who 
had a great business idea,

192
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:26,250
but an idea by itself has little or no 
use.

193
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:28,680
You have to execute on it.
So these new friends,

194
00:10:28,681 --> 00:10:32,520
they put down money out of their own 
pockets to launch their first prototype,

195
00:10:32,521 --> 00:10:35,730
which was the facebook.com
and well,

196
00:10:35,830 --> 00:10:38,670
you know the rest of the story.
Suddenly all of the students,

197
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:41,550
Harvard University,
they had an account next stage.

198
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:42,413
Well that was to become a serious 
company with work as officers and other 

199
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,270
important stuff like that and valeant 
bought and stuff.

200
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:51,630
You need money as well.
Did they have any money?

201
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,703
Well,
no.

202
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,753
So what did they do while they went to 
silicon valley and they met this guy at 

203
00:10:56,350 --> 00:10:58,780
that you see here,
his name is Peter

204
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,420
and

205
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:08,253
listen up here because this is the first
difference between the valley and the 

206
00:11:11,171 --> 00:11:12,004
rest of the world.
He's a teal is what we know as an angel 

207
00:11:14,711 --> 00:11:15,544
investor.
He's a guy with a lot of money and he's 

208
00:11:17,231 --> 00:11:18,064
willing to invest in companies that are 
still in this valley of death at this 

209
00:11:21,431 --> 00:11:22,780
moment,
2004.

210
00:11:22,781 --> 00:11:25,120
Facebook was an idea with a lot of 
potential,

211
00:11:25,121 --> 00:11:25,954
but almost no profit investment.
It was so risky that no bank woodlands 

212
00:11:29,591 --> 00:11:31,890
any money to them.
So instead Peter Teal,

213
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,050
but $500,000
into facebook with this,

214
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,770
he was buying 10 percent of the company 
and now you might be wondering,

215
00:11:38,771 --> 00:11:39,604
well,
why just 10 percent at the end of the 

216
00:11:41,021 --> 00:11:42,130
day?
Back then facebook,

217
00:11:42,131 --> 00:11:44,880
it wasn't worth anything with so much 
money invested.

218
00:11:44,890 --> 00:11:48,550
Peter Teal could have demanded a bigger 
share of the company and to be fair,

219
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:52,360
that is absolutely true if they were 
located somewhere like Alabama.

220
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:56,060
So they began offering competing good 
conditions to the entrepreneur nurse.

221
00:11:56,110 --> 00:11:56,943
So if he asks for too many shares of the
company is knocking bag and sovereign 

222
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:02,040
would just have gone to somebody else.
Don't worry there.

223
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,883
Everybody.
Peter Thiel is still extraordinarily 

224
00:12:05,171 --> 00:12:05,981
rich.
All right,

225
00:12:05,981 --> 00:12:08,920
so you're probably beginning to 
understand why it's a good idea to start

226
00:12:08,921 --> 00:12:09,754
companies yet,
but hold on a minute because you ain't 

227
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,430
seen nothing yet with all million 
dollars,

228
00:12:13,550 --> 00:12:16,720
facebook's founders could start building
something big,

229
00:12:16,721 --> 00:12:19,270
something that could be sold to the mass
market.

230
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,880
Really,
this is the moment when a company proves

231
00:12:21,881 --> 00:12:22,714
itself successful or not.
The moment when they survive the valley 

232
00:12:25,841 --> 00:12:27,430
of death,
while they don't.

233
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:31,540
If facebook was founded in Alabama,
they would have probably stopped here.

234
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:35,620
They had a product it worked out and the
money to live on and the story,

235
00:12:35,710 --> 00:12:36,543
but remember this is a startup and it's 
goal is to grow as fast as it possibly 

236
00:12:40,751 --> 00:12:41,380
can.

237
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,990
This is where those vc funds came into 
the shop.

238
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,450
We're not talking about a Peter Teal guy
with a lot of money here.

239
00:12:46,451 --> 00:12:51,250
We're talking about companies with even 
more money and the team of advisors.

240
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:52,203
This is important because in many cases 
vc funders can make vital decisions in 

241
00:12:55,781 --> 00:12:56,614
the company and even tell the founders 
how they have to design their corporate 

242
00:12:59,501 --> 00:13:00,334
structure,
who they can partner with or even how 

243
00:13:02,681 --> 00:13:05,020
and when to expand internationally.
All right,

244
00:13:05,021 --> 00:13:07,740
so coming back to our facebook story,
in the year 2005,

245
00:13:07,741 --> 00:13:11,770
a vc fund called Excel partners put 12 
point $7,000,000

246
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:15,070
into facebook with this.
They owned 13 percent of the company.

247
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,873
As an aside,
if you remember Peter Teal bought 10 

248
00:13:22,861 --> 00:13:23,694
percent of facebook with half a million 
dollars and the less excel partners 

249
00:13:26,941 --> 00:13:31,080
subsequently paid 12 point $7,000,000
for 13 percent of the company.

250
00:13:31,170 --> 00:13:34,020
If you do the math,
you see that from one day to the next,

251
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:37,860
facebook is now valued at $98 million 
dollars.

252
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:38,723
In other words,
in just one year Peter teals investment 

253
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,690
increased by 2000 percent.

254
00:13:42,810 --> 00:13:43,770
Pretty impressive,
right?

255
00:13:43,771 --> 00:13:45,530
But again,
hold on because yes,

256
00:13:45,531 --> 00:13:46,364
still haven't seen anything yet.
This ansel partners investment is what 

257
00:13:49,201 --> 00:13:52,240
we call a series a investments.
And if there's a series a,

258
00:13:52,241 --> 00:13:55,770
it's because later we have a series B,
series c.

259
00:13:55,860 --> 00:13:57,510
alright,
so in the case of facebook,

260
00:13:57,511 --> 00:14:02,511
the series c funding was Microsoft.
He paid $240,000,000

261
00:14:03,391 --> 00:14:04,224
in 2007 for this $240,000,000.
They were getting just one point six 

262
00:14:09,451 --> 00:14:10,284
percent of facebook,
so let's return to our maths because 

263
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:13,643
it's pretty mind blowing.
Facebook is now valued at 

264
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:19,410
$15,000,000,000.
This means that that 10 percent,

265
00:14:19,411 --> 00:14:24,411
the Pto ball for half a million dollars 
is now worth 300 percent more.

266
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:28,473
Oh,

267
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:32,470
alright.
So this means that if you regular viewer

268
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:36,210
had invested just a hundred dollars in 
facebook in the year 2004,

269
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,163
you'd now have enough money to buy a 
waterfront house with a swimming pool 

270
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,110
and a mini golf course.
All right,

271
00:14:42,111 --> 00:14:44,490
so hold on a moment because at this 
point you might be wondering,

272
00:14:44,491 --> 00:14:45,810
well hold on a second.
Simon,

273
00:14:45,811 --> 00:14:48,420
was facebook actually worth 
$15,000,000,000

274
00:14:48,421 --> 00:14:49,254
at that moment?
Did they really make enough money to 

275
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:54,590
that crazy $240,000,000
investments?

276
00:14:55,010 --> 00:14:56,710
Well,
no,

277
00:14:56,990 --> 00:15:01,310
but you see by investing all that money,
you get lots and lots of things,

278
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:05,660
things that sooner or later what ends up
making you a profit and this,

279
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:08,420
this is when we get to the final stage 
of a startup,

280
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,810
but we sell it to a big company or do we
go public?

281
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,910
Facebook?
They decided to enter the stock market,

282
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:17,630
but many other startups will typically 
be sold to big multinational company.

283
00:15:20,990 --> 00:15:24,350
I pull back exam in $400,000,000

284
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,750
and yes,
I know what you are going to tell me.

285
00:15:27,751 --> 00:15:29,730
All right Simon,
this sounds really,

286
00:15:29,731 --> 00:15:30,564
really good,
but I just don't believe it's that easy 

287
00:15:32,550 --> 00:15:36,960
and why you'd be absolutely Ryan's 
because nine out of 10 startups fail,

288
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:37,853
but importantly,
you just need one to succeed to make a 

289
00:15:41,101 --> 00:15:43,740
lot of people crazy,
crazy,

290
00:15:43,741 --> 00:15:44,574
rich.
This is why the goal of so many 

291
00:15:45,781 --> 00:15:49,340
politicians now is to make that own 
silicon valley

292
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:56,190
white Bernadine silicon alley is 
Europe's new silicon,

293
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:02,090
the Mexicans,
silicon

294
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,023
volume

295
00:16:05,530 --> 00:16:07,720
Africa near Silicon Valley's.

296
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:08,673
Yep.
Everybody wants to have their own 

297
00:16:09,851 --> 00:16:12,280
silicon valley in their own back yard.
Well,

298
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:15,580
everybody except for those people who 
actually lived in silicon

299
00:16:18,990 --> 00:16:22,560
lit are abandoning silicon valley in 
droves,

300
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:26,200
but that is something we're going to 
actually talk about in our next video.

301
00:16:26,201 --> 00:16:28,270
Meanwhile,
the big question is this,

302
00:16:28,271 --> 00:16:32,190
do you think we can replicate the 
silicon valley model in other countries?

303
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:35,470
While please do leave your answer in the
comments section below.

304
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:36,304

307

We consider it as a podcast that 

315
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:04,470
challenges you to reconsider your views 
by providing context,

316
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,780
but we don't do the thing.
