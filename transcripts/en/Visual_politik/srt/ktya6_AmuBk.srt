1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
Imagine that you could buy stocks in 
your uncle's farm and guess I know that 

2
00:00:03,841 --> 00:00:06,450
assumes that your uncle has a farm.
Let's say it's a small farm,

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,284
it's got some cows,
etc. And you can buy stocks from his 

4
00:00:10,950 --> 00:00:11,783
company,
something you would do on the stock 

5
00:00:16,491 --> 00:00:17,324
market,
just like you deal with big companies 

6
00:00:18,381 --> 00:00:19,640
like apple,
exxon,

7
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:21,440
or chevron thing.
I'm crAzy.

8
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:22,303
Well,
actually I'm not at all and at the end 

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,480
of this video you're going to see 
exactly where I'm coming from.

10
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,630
Let's say you want to start a company,
a traditional company.

11
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:37,523
Let's stick to the example of California
that's going to produce milk and other 

12
00:00:40,381 --> 00:00:43,620
dairy products.
What is the first thing that you need?

13
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,450
Well,
of course that's going to be money.

14
00:00:45,451 --> 00:00:46,284
You need money to buy the property.
The facilities as well as the all 

15
00:00:48,961 --> 00:00:53,961
important was so where can you get the 
money to do this?

16
00:00:55,431 --> 00:00:56,264
Well,
the first option of course is going to 

17
00:00:57,291 --> 00:01:00,830
be to go to the bank,
but this has a whole bunch of issues.

18
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:04,730
The first one is that if it wasn't risky
enough to start your own company,

19
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:09,440
having a loan makes it even more risky.
You could end up bankrupt and in debt.

20
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:10,423
Besides then there's the whole thing 
that the bank have might actually not 

21
00:01:12,231 --> 00:01:15,080
give you that loan.
If you've ever tried to get a loan start

22
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:17,240
company,
you know exactly what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:20,480
It's pretty hard to convince a banker to
lend you any money.

24
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,070
So let's.
First of all,

25
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:22,933
disregard of a bank option.
The next alternative is a venture 

26
00:01:25,881 --> 00:01:26,714
capitalist.
You know those guys out in silicon 

27
00:01:28,401 --> 00:01:29,234
valley.
These people were the loads of cash and 

28
00:01:30,441 --> 00:01:33,590
a willingness to invest in young talents
just like you.

29
00:01:33,591 --> 00:01:36,650
I mean who knows,
maybe a small farm might become the next

30
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:37,513
industry been off,
but then you run into the problem that 

31
00:01:42,831 --> 00:01:45,530
you probably don't know any venture 
capitalists,

32
00:01:45,531 --> 00:01:47,900
especially if you're somewhere like in 
the middle of India.

33
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:50,360
so there's no banks,
there's new venture capitalists,

34
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,790
but maybe a parents are rich,
but if they're not,

35
00:01:52,791 --> 00:01:53,624
well I guess that's not any help.
So just hold on for a minute because I 

36
00:01:56,481 --> 00:02:00,710
think I have an idea what if you could 
already entered the stock market,

37
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,430
you know,
something like wall street where general

38
00:02:07,431 --> 00:02:11,330
motors and mcdonald's operate the good 
thing and now the stock market is,

39
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,240
you don't need to know a millionaire to 
get funding.

40
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:18,290
There aren't thousands of small 
investors out there who buy stocks every

41
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:19,123
day.
So let's say you divide your company 

42
00:02:20,061 --> 00:02:20,894
into 10,000 stocks in each of them has 
an initial price of $10 and people no 

43
00:02:25,971 --> 00:02:27,890
matter where they live can buy those 
shares.

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:30,913
Say maybe there's a guy in Kansas who 
buys one stock in the zero women in 

45
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:37,150
France.
He buys 10 this way with no contacts and

46
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:39,820
no bank loans.
You can get the funding you need.

47
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:42,910
You just need a good idea and a bit of 
hard work,

48
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:43,953
right?

49
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:47,190
Well

50
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,680
hold on a second.
Didn't get too excited.

51
00:02:48,681 --> 00:02:50,810
There's a pretty major problem here.
For instance,

52
00:02:50,811 --> 00:02:53,270
if you want to get into the New York 
stock exchange,

53
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:54,104
your company,
it should have already made at least 

54
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,380
$10,000,000 in the last three years.
And that's just the beginning.

55
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,100
There are lots and lots of regulations 
that you have to meet.

56
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,960
well,
this is the situation that the guys from

57
00:03:04,961 --> 00:03:05,794
hako sky agricultural company we're in,
they lived in Russia and they wanted to 

58
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:11,080
start a cow farm and they had no money 
so.

59
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,520
Well,
what do you think they did?

60
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:13,593
Well?
Check it out.

61
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:18,373
back to coco skier agricultural company 
plans to launch an ico named milk coin 

62
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,170
to fund a dairy farm.
Yep.

63
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,053
You heard that right?
These farmers launch their own 

64
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:27,253
cryptocurrency.
It's basically their own version of 

65
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,343
bitcoin.
They advertised it on their website and 

66
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,504
launched the offer of these new coins.
This is what we call an initial coin 

67
00:03:36,351 --> 00:03:39,290
offering or ico.
So now you might be wondering,

68
00:03:39,291 --> 00:03:40,124
well,
why would I buy another cryptocurrency 

69
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,113
bitcoin enough?
Now you might just think that you're 

70
00:03:44,511 --> 00:03:46,610
just buying some sort of virtual coin 
here,

71
00:03:46,611 --> 00:03:47,444
but the reality is you're actually 
buying stocks and you're doing it 

72
00:03:49,821 --> 00:03:52,450
without going through the traditional 
stock markets.

73
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,313
But at the end of this video,
I'm going to tell you what happens with 

74
00:03:54,711 --> 00:03:55,544
this company,
but the fact is they're not the only 

75
00:03:57,381 --> 00:03:58,214
example.

76
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,360
Forty eight percent of those were 
successful last year,

77
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:09,560
but startups still managEd to raise five
point $6,000,000,000.

78
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,391
Yes,
if you have.

79
00:04:10,391 --> 00:04:11,224
That appears to be a brand new way of 
getting money to start a company and 

80
00:04:13,761 --> 00:04:14,594
it's available for everybody right now,
but hold on just a minute because not 

81
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:20,450
everything is a beautiful and as you can
imagine,

82
00:04:20,451 --> 00:04:21,284
these icrs seem like a scam as paradise.
So the question is can we really trust 

83
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:29,600
this brand new way of starting companies
and what does Switzerland and have to do

84
00:04:29,601 --> 00:04:30,434
with all of this today?
We're going to answer all of these 

85
00:04:31,521 --> 00:04:33,530
questions,
but before we do as usual,

86
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:38,560
let's take a look back at the history 
coins versus tokens.

87
00:04:40,190 --> 00:04:41,023
In the year 2013,
everyone in the tech industry was 

88
00:04:42,951 --> 00:04:45,860
already pretty aware of bitcoin in 
silicon valley.

89
00:04:45,861 --> 00:04:46,694
They were celebrating all kinds of 
events and talking about the future of 

90
00:04:49,701 --> 00:04:50,534
this currency.

91
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:53,660
Yeah.

92
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:57,160
In one of them,
that was a man called j dot r with it.

93
00:04:57,250 --> 00:04:58,083
This man had a very funny idea.
He said we could create alternative 

94
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:01,684
currencies that using the same 
technology as bitcoin would have 

95
00:05:04,241 --> 00:05:06,910
different rules and how are you going to
pay all the itv,

96
00:05:06,911 --> 00:05:08,770
but he would design all of this.
They asked him,

97
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,890
he said that instead of looking for a 
venture capitalist,

98
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:12,933
he could sell some notes,
what we call a token that will be 

99
00:05:15,791 --> 00:05:17,680
exchanged for coins,
swamps.

100
00:05:17,681 --> 00:05:18,514
They were created,
and this is how the first initial Coin 

101
00:05:21,670 --> 00:05:22,810
offering was created,

102
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:26,990
but before

103
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:29,060
we continue,
many of you might be wondering,

104
00:05:29,061 --> 00:05:30,800
well,
what exactly is a token?

105
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:31,733
Well,
tokens are any elements that can be 

106
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:37,190
changed in a blockchain.
Cryptocurrencies are one kind of token,

107
00:05:37,191 --> 00:05:39,050
but there are many more.
On the one hand,

108
00:05:39,051 --> 00:05:41,660
we have those that give a right to its 
owner.

109
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,523
For instance,
those notes that you could exchange for 

110
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:46,130
brand new currencies when they are 
created.

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,793
On the other hand,
we have the tokens that are based on an 

112
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:54,370
asset.
This would be the case,

113
00:05:54,371 --> 00:05:55,204
so if the stocks at the russian farmers 
having one of their tokens means having 

114
00:05:58,581 --> 00:05:59,414
a share of their company visit initial 
public offering of tokens became 

115
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:06,200
fashionable in the year 2014.
So why was that?

116
00:06:06,201 --> 00:06:08,450
What exactly happens In this year?
Well,

117
00:06:08,451 --> 00:06:12,770
that was the year when the second most 
famous cryptocurrency was created.

118
00:06:16,610 --> 00:06:21,020
The decentralized platform that might 
displace today's institutions.

119
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:24,400
Unlike bitcoin,
we all know who is behind a theory.

120
00:06:24,610 --> 00:06:27,820
This is a company that offers way more 
than a cryptocurrency.

121
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:28,743
They also offer a system so other people
can create their own cryptocurrency 

122
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,090
isn't in their own tokens.
For example.

123
00:06:34,091 --> 00:06:34,924
Do you remember this other video where I
told you about how a spanish bank is 

124
00:06:37,421 --> 00:06:40,000
using blockchains,
give corporate loans?

125
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:40,893
Well,
if theory in is the platform that they 

126
00:06:42,281 --> 00:06:43,114
use,
we are only talking about spanish banks 

127
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,904
here.
The theory has made it really easy for 

128
00:06:47,201 --> 00:06:50,980
lots of people to start creating 
different financial products on

129
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,253
chain

130
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:55,613
theory and rush has been unleashed.
Isis ceos are in fashion in the tech 

131
00:06:59,431 --> 00:07:00,300
investment world.

132
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,193
Since then,
lots of companies are getting financed 

133
00:07:03,121 --> 00:07:04,260
this way.
For example,

134
00:07:04,261 --> 00:07:05,094
serum labs,
a swiss company that is about to launch 

135
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:09,990
their own smartphone,
this company has got more than a hundred

136
00:07:09,991 --> 00:07:14,991
and $18,000,000 thanks to one of the 
most successful ice a's in history,

137
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,313
and of course there are all kinds of 
internet companies that have been born 

138
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:20,543
with this system,
but just hold on a second because not 

139
00:07:22,321 --> 00:07:23,154
everything is so great.
Ico is they've got no regulation 

140
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:27,143
whatsoever,
so you can certainly imagine there are 

141
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,960
some problems.

142
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:36,370
How to create an ico scam in five simple
steps.

143
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:37,610
Now you might be wondering,
well,

144
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:41,240
what's the difference between an ico and
a website like kickstarter?

145
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:43,280
Well,
that's actually pretty easy to onset.

146
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:48,340
If you support some kickstarter project,
you can't sell any shares on an ico.

147
00:07:48,530 --> 00:07:53,150
You can buy a token or a coin and if it 
rises higher and market value,

148
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,133
you can sell it to another investor.
The only problem is that here there is 

149
00:08:02,571 --> 00:08:06,380
no financial police or fcc running 
against the bad guys.

150
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:07,243
So yes,
there were plenty of people who thought 

151
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:12,200
they could get rich really quick and 
then ended up losing a ton of money.

152
00:08:15,990 --> 00:08:16,823
For example,
saved ride was a german company that 

153
00:08:18,481 --> 00:08:21,270
wanted to make a cryptocurrency based 
credit card.

154
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,313
It has all the buzzwords to make 
speculators happy and everything seemed 

155
00:08:25,531 --> 00:08:28,620
great.
The technology Was there and it was very

156
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,200
disruptive.
They got $50,000,000 to launch it,

157
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:33,390
so once they got their money,
what do you think happens?

158
00:08:33,450 --> 00:08:34,283
Well,
they just disappeared and since there 

159
00:08:35,341 --> 00:08:36,174
was no public register whatsoever,
it's almost impossible to find the 

160
00:08:39,321 --> 00:08:40,154
owner.

161
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:45,213
I'm sure you've all seen the ads onlIne 
for coins and tokens and things that 

162
00:08:48,821 --> 00:08:51,760
promise a whole ton of profits.
I mean for a better understanding,

163
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:52,594
even the ceo of a theory and butter like
butter and recognized that most of the 

164
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,740
ico is a scam.
As you can imagine.

165
00:08:58,741 --> 00:09:02,130
Governments have already started to act.
China has banned ics.

166
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,680
America seems to be following a similar 
path.

167
00:09:04,710 --> 00:09:07,530
Other countries like Estonia said that 
it's okay to invest in.

168
00:09:07,531 --> 00:09:10,830
Ico is for everyone except estonian 
citizens,

169
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,450
so they're essentially saying something 
like,

170
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:13,051
oh yeah,
man,

171
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,290
you can totally scam anyone you like,
just not my own citizens.

172
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,220
Cool.
Nonetheless,

173
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:20,070
there is one country that has found an 
intermediate solution.

174
00:09:20,130 --> 00:09:21,420
They weren't banned.
Ico is,

175
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,170
but they will not let them go 
unregulated as they are today.

176
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,790
And what country am I talking about?
Well,

177
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:27,653
let me give you a clear.
It's probably the channel we've talked 

178
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:32,430
to most about here on visual politic 
already knows.

179
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:33,450
Well,
yes,

180
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,480
of course.
We're talking about sir,

181
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,633
when the krypto nation.
During that video we made about 

182
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:48,210
Switzerland there we talked about kansan
called zog,

183
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:50,250
which has the lowest taxes in the car.

184
00:09:53,730 --> 00:09:55,970
Well guess what?
The theory and has its headquarters.

185
00:09:56,030 --> 00:09:56,863
Having the biggest cryptocurrency 
company in your country means that you 

186
00:09:59,751 --> 00:10:02,270
also have the biggest experts on the 
mass of that.

187
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,690
So most of the ico is,
are done on swift service.

188
00:10:05,750 --> 00:10:07,760
And of course the swiss government soon 
realize that,

189
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:09,200
uh,
with or without scams,

190
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:11,350
this was a multi million dollar.

191
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:12,333
The street

192
00:10:16,470 --> 00:10:18,900
wants to be the world capital of 
cryptocurrency.

193
00:10:18,990 --> 00:10:22,350
Four of the 10 biggest initial coin 
offerings last year.

194
00:10:22,351 --> 00:10:24,810
We're in Switzerland more than any other
country.

195
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:29,940
This is why some swiss municipalities 
let the citizens pay taxes or even fines

196
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,133
with cryptocurrencies as having less 
than 30,000 inhabitants is already the 

197
00:10:34,501 --> 00:10:35,334
home of 400 blockchain based companies 
and the regional government is already 

198
00:10:39,691 --> 00:10:40,524
doing trials.
To use this technology to organize 

199
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:43,104
referendums,
you probably already know that 

200
00:10:44,521 --> 00:10:49,290
referendums and direct democracy are 
essential in the swiss political system,

201
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:50,213
so well now they want to do it with 
blockchain and of course Switzerland 

202
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:56,460
wants to become the pioneer in ico 
regulations too.

203
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:03,640
This financial authority releases ico 
specific regulatory guidelines.

204
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,210
For example,
any company that wants to make an ico in

205
00:11:06,211 --> 00:11:07,044
Switzerland,
we'll have to do it through a swiss 

206
00:11:08,671 --> 00:11:10,800
company.
This means they will have to regIster,

207
00:11:10,801 --> 00:11:12,780
then have to give their name and 
physical address.

208
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:15,630
This way it will be easier to chase 
terrorists,

209
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,090
knockers or scammers.
As you can imagine,

210
00:11:18,091 --> 00:11:19,430
these regulations,
well,

211
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,190
they're starting to work and many 
companies have already gone to other tax

212
00:11:23,191 --> 00:11:24,024
havens like the cayman islands,
which offer a complete doggy dog 

213
00:11:26,881 --> 00:11:29,190
environments where you can essentially 
do whatever you want.

214
00:11:34,510 --> 00:11:35,343
This is the short term price you have to
pay in order to have a stable 

215
00:11:38,471 --> 00:11:39,304
environment.
We're talking about a wells that still 

216
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,990
needs a lot of work before it becomes a 
mature market.

217
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:46,780
One thing is for sure it has pLenty of 
possibilities.

218
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:47,643
Many scams,
lots of money laundering and some easy 

219
00:11:49,571 --> 00:11:50,404
money to be made.
So the swiss way seems to be the 

220
00:11:52,391 --> 00:11:55,360
smartest far yes and new technology has 
come.

221
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,390
It is risky,
but it has many possibilities to instead

222
00:11:58,391 --> 00:12:01,090
of banning us or letting it run 
completely free,

223
00:12:01,091 --> 00:12:01,924
the best option is to regulate it.
This way we take the good and to avoid 

224
00:12:05,141 --> 00:12:06,160
the bad,
by the way,

225
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:07,840
going all the way back to our russian 
friends,

226
00:12:07,841 --> 00:12:10,840
the ones you wanted to finance their 
farm with cryptocurrency.

227
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:12,400
Well,
we've got some bad news

228
00:12:12,410 --> 00:12:13,243
it for you

229
00:12:16,270 --> 00:12:19,720
originally since milk coin raised only 
two percent of the soft cap.

230
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:22,150
We're giving back all funds that we 
received.

231
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:24,910
We will start the return on the 21st of 
November.

232
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:26,710
Huge thanks to our backers.

233
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:29,490
Now the question becomes,
do you think other countries will follow

234
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:32,670
the swiss example?
It is clear that we still need more time

235
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:35,010
for the ico market to grow and become 
mature,

236
00:12:35,011 --> 00:12:38,790
but do you think it can be the 
capitalist revolution that will open the

237
00:12:38,791 --> 00:12:41,790
entry barriers to starting a company?
Please welcome.
