1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,460
Hollywood's it's the world's most famous
neighborhoods spans.

3
00:00:10,461 --> 00:00:11,241
Yes,
I said that.

4
00:00:11,241 --> 00:00:13,730
Absolutely right.
Hollywood is a neighborhood.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:15,890
It's not a city.
It's not even a village.

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,600
Hollywood is a district inside the city 
of Los Angeles with a population of less

7
00:00:20,601 --> 00:00:21,920
than 90,000
people.

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,950
Nonetheless,
here is where most of the movie industry

9
00:00:24,951 --> 00:00:25,784
has concentrated.
Wait just a minute because I know what 

10
00:00:30,421 --> 00:00:31,560
you're going to say.
Come on.

11
00:00:31,600 --> 00:00:33,090
Signer,
and I know better than this.

12
00:00:33,091 --> 00:00:35,920
This isn't a tall tree.
The biggest movie production centered.

13
00:00:35,950 --> 00:00:38,740
The world is Bollywood in India.
Well my dear viewers,

14
00:00:38,741 --> 00:00:42,210
you up sort of right here,
but there is a pretty significant,

15
00:00:42,211 --> 00:00:43,044
but now despite the fact that the Indian
movie industry makes more movies than 

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,190
anyone of their income is tiny compared 
to that of Hollywood,

17
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:56,550
I think just think about it.
How many Indian movies have you actually

18
00:00:56,551 --> 00:00:57,384
seen?
I bet the answer to that is number or 

19
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,200
lost and undone less.
Of course your Indian,

20
00:01:01,201 --> 00:01:02,160
in which case,
hello,

21
00:01:02,161 --> 00:01:04,830
dear Indian viewers.
Now with a few exceptions,

22
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:05,723
Bollywood movies are made to the 
domestic market and the same goes for 

23
00:01:09,361 --> 00:01:10,194
Nigeria.
Nigeria is actually the second largest 

24
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:14,790
movie producer in the world behind 
Bollywood.

25
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:15,773
But I'm sure hardly any of you have 
actually seen a film made in this 

26
00:01:18,541 --> 00:01:20,860
country and you are of course in 
Nigerian,

27
00:01:20,861 --> 00:01:22,920
in which case,
hello Nigerian viewers.

28
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,530
So when it comes to the raw economics of
it all,

29
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:28,530
Hollywood is undoubtedly the world's 
movie capitol.

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:30,120
So now you might be wondering,
well,

31
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:32,520
Simon,
why are we talking about cinema here?

32
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:33,354
A visual politic.
Isn't this channel all about politics 

33
00:01:35,161 --> 00:01:36,360
and economics?
I mean,

34
00:01:36,361 --> 00:01:38,250
what's the connection here?
Well,

35
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,500
actually there are a lot of connection.

36
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,630
First there is the fact that there is a 
political reason why he's so much of the

37
00:01:50,631 --> 00:01:53,210
movie world is centered in Hollywood and
the end of the day,

38
00:01:53,211 --> 00:01:54,044
I mean,
why as Hollywood in Los Angeles and not 

39
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:59,120
in New York or London or somewhere else 
entirely.

40
00:01:59,180 --> 00:02:00,013
Now,
many of you might think that California 

41
00:02:01,101 --> 00:02:05,840
has always been an important state in 
the u s with innovative companies,

42
00:02:05,841 --> 00:02:09,560
prestigious universities and celebrities
just walking down the street.

43
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,320
But the truth is that at the beginning 
of the 20th century,

44
00:02:12,470 --> 00:02:15,620
La had less of an 100,000
inhabitants.

45
00:02:15,740 --> 00:02:16,573
In fact,
the first movie producers were born on 

46
00:02:18,381 --> 00:02:21,860
the other side of the country.
Then cities like New York or Chicago.

47
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,620
So the question we have to ask now is,
well,

48
00:02:24,621 --> 00:02:25,454
why did they decide to move to la?
What does Hollywood have the Manhattan 

49
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:31,190
doesn't?
And the most important question of all,

50
00:02:31,191 --> 00:02:33,620
what does immigration have to do with 
any of this?

51
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:36,770
Well today we are going to answer all of
those questions,

52
00:02:36,771 --> 00:02:37,604
but before we do as usual,
let's take a look at the history art by 

53
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,990
and for immigrants.
The first question of all when it has to

54
00:02:47,991 --> 00:02:50,030
be who invented movies in the first 
place?

55
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:52,190
The Lumiere brothers,
well,

56
00:02:52,191 --> 00:02:56,570
not exactly what the Lumiere brothers 
invented was the system to project films

57
00:02:56,571 --> 00:02:57,404
onto a big screen.
But years before that the company of 

58
00:03:00,041 --> 00:03:00,874
Thomas Edison had already discovered a 
system to record and play short movies 

59
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,914
and this was called a kinetoscope.
It was a device where you would put a 

60
00:03:08,711 --> 00:03:11,980
coin into a slot and watch movies 
through AP poll.

61
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:15,513
He is later.
This system would be improved so that 

62
00:03:17,561 --> 00:03:20,980
these short films could be projected 
onto a big screen as well.

63
00:03:21,130 --> 00:03:21,963
But the big difference between Edison 
and the Lumiere brothers was that the 

64
00:03:24,851 --> 00:03:29,260
American businessmen knew that these 
could make big time money.

65
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:34,410
Anything that won't sell,
I don't want to invent it.

66
00:03:34,411 --> 00:03:39,170
Sale is proof of utility and utility is 
success.

67
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:41,090
Thomas Alva Edison,

68
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:44,670
so while the Lumiere brothers showed off
their invention at scientific fairs,

69
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:45,504
Edison made a profit from it.
His business consisted of selling these 

70
00:03:48,601 --> 00:03:49,434
machines,
taking a royalty for their use and 

71
00:03:50,761 --> 00:03:53,700
supplying movie theaters with lots and 
lots of films.

72
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,200
It just two decades,
Edison made more than 1,200

73
00:03:58,201 --> 00:03:59,820
movies.
It's like now you might be wondering,

74
00:03:59,860 --> 00:04:02,940
what kind of movies did Edison produce?
Well,

75
00:04:02,941 --> 00:04:03,774
as bizarre,
more not as it possibly sounds as many 

76
00:04:05,821 --> 00:04:09,510
of these first films in history were 
about women getting undressed,

77
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:12,540
but movies were bigger opportunity and 
just a few years,

78
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:16,980
cities like New York and Chicago became 
flooded with movie theaters.

79
00:04:16,981 --> 00:04:17,814
The so called Nickelodeon's.
Here you find a great show at a lower 

80
00:04:22,141 --> 00:04:23,850
price in another theaters.
Plus,

81
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,713
since the movies were silent,
you didn't need to speak English to 

82
00:04:27,481 --> 00:04:28,314
understand them.
This means movies became the perfect 

83
00:04:30,001 --> 00:04:33,600
entertainments for all the immigrants 
arriving to the lands of opportunity.

84
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:34,493
All of this,
it was happening in the first decade of 

85
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:38,490
the 20th century men's while France,
since interestingly,

86
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,130
Denmark already were producing that own 
movies.

87
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,340
No other country had a bigger audience 
than America.

88
00:04:47,380 --> 00:04:48,213
How is that Thomas Edison?
He wasn't able to see all of the 

89
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,950
opportunities behind his invention.
At the end of the day,

90
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,220
he was the typical wasp and d despised 
immigrants.

91
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,530
Of course,
he was happy to be money from them,

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,140
but he didn't really like them and so 
now you might be asking,

93
00:05:01,141 --> 00:05:03,090
well,
why didn't he invests money in improving

94
00:05:03,091 --> 00:05:04,560
the quality of his films?
Well,

95
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:05,423
at the end of the day,
his company had a monopoly over the 

96
00:05:06,811 --> 00:05:08,730
production and distribution of the 
films.

97
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,810
It's like he really didn't have any 
incentive to

98
00:05:10,940 --> 00:05:15,230
all those nickelodeon's paid royalties 
to Edison's company and bought his films

99
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,630
without even looking at the titles are 
plots.

100
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:20,180
At the end of the day,
nobody thought those German,

101
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:23,560
Italian or Hungarian immigrants would 
appreciate the details.

102
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,593
Of course,
this was until this man you see on the 

103
00:05:31,311 --> 00:05:32,144
screen right now came along.
Of course I'm talking about call Lemley 

104
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,490
Emily.
He was one of these German immigrants.

105
00:05:42,491 --> 00:05:45,400
He worked at a nickelodeon in Chicago 
business.

106
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:46,234
It was great,
but he was sick of paying so much money 

107
00:05:47,831 --> 00:05:51,160
if they that a sense movies.
So he asked himself the question wrong,

108
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:53,560
can just,
I make my own movies and as well,

109
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:55,060
yes,
he absolutely could.

110
00:05:58,750 --> 00:05:59,750
I,
I'll say Lenley.

111
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:03,050
He knew other nickelodeon owners.
All of them were immigrants too,

112
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:06,720
as they knew the tastes and aspirations 
of their audiences.

113
00:06:06,870 --> 00:06:07,703
They knew that movies,
they could become something much more 

114
00:06:09,631 --> 00:06:12,810
than just cheap jokes and girls with not
very many clothes.

115
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,260
They could create stars like those seen 
on Broadway.

116
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,093
Okay.

117
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,113
These cinema pioneers were the first 
ones to include the actor's name on the 

118
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,194
posters and in the credits this way,
many more artists were willing to work 

119
00:06:30,651 --> 00:06:31,484
for them.
Their films became famous among 

120
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,660
immigrants who came.
They came from all over the worlds,

121
00:06:35,750 --> 00:06:39,130
and this is why they named their company
universal.

122
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:42,723
Okay.

123
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,330
As you can imagine,
the success of this new company,

124
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,550
they didn't spot others to follow suit,
for instance,

125
00:06:47,551 --> 00:06:49,550
and other Hungarian immigrants named 
adults.

126
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,030
Zucker made another partnership with 
other nickelodeon owners.

127
00:06:53,031 --> 00:06:56,670
Zahn started another studio,
which was called paramount pictures,

128
00:06:56,850 --> 00:06:58,890
southernly New York,
and in general,

129
00:06:58,891 --> 00:07:01,950
the east coast became sort of the 
primitive version of Hollywood.

130
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,800
The hold on for just a minute because 
Thomas Edison,

131
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:12,110
well,
he was not willing to lose this battle.

132
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:14,090
Don't forget,
he had the fame,

133
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,320
the money,
am's,

134
00:07:15,321 --> 00:07:18,110
the patterns.
So in less than five years,

135
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:21,710
Lemley and his partner's feast over 200 
lawsuits.

136
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:24,980
The same happens with the rest of the 
small studios and as well,

137
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:30,040
many of them went bankrupt.
Oh yeah.

138
00:07:31,561 --> 00:07:34,340
This was a pretty bad side.
The movie studios is bad.

139
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:36,690
It was pretty much a golden era for 
lawyers,

140
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:43,163
and if all of this was not enough,
Edison had enough power to force all of 

141
00:07:46,351 --> 00:07:50,820
the nickelodeons from New York and 
Chicago to sign exclusivity contracts.

142
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,900
If they wanted Addison's technology,
it couldn't buy movies from his rivals.

143
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,253
Well,
this is the moment when our friend 

144
00:07:58,951 --> 00:07:59,784
called Lemley,
asked himself another important 

145
00:08:01,681 --> 00:08:02,580
question,
well,

146
00:08:02,610 --> 00:08:04,870
why should they stay on the east coast?
Addison,

147
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:05,783
he was a powerful man in ds,
but it's influence didn't reach 

148
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:09,114
everywhere.
There was a place far out of his reach 

149
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,410
and that place it was California

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,820
birth of an industry.
In the end,

151
00:08:17,821 --> 00:08:18,654
90 15 California,
there was the place to be thousands of 

152
00:08:21,311 --> 00:08:22,144
young immigrants.
The perfect audience for these would 

153
00:08:23,891 --> 00:08:24,724
arrive every year.
Houses and properties were cheaper than 

154
00:08:27,161 --> 00:08:30,130
anywhere else in America.
And as if this was not enough,

155
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:32,560
if the weather was pretty fantastic in 
New York,

156
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:34,990
it rains a ray of the day.
So if you wanted to make movies,

157
00:08:34,991 --> 00:08:38,080
you'd better have a studio and spend 
thousands of dollars on lights.

158
00:08:38,230 --> 00:08:39,063
In California,
there's plenty of sunshine all year 

159
00:08:40,301 --> 00:08:42,630
round,
so it's really easy to shoot outside.

160
00:08:47,280 --> 00:08:48,113
This is why all those big studios from 
New York and Chicago moved into a 

161
00:08:52,021 --> 00:08:54,420
neighborhood on the outskirts of Los 
Angeles,

162
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,690
a small with less or more than 500 
inhabitants.

163
00:08:57,930 --> 00:09:01,290
And as you've probably guessed by now,
well that tiny place,

164
00:09:01,350 --> 00:09:02,220
it was Hollywood,

165
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,630
but the story,
it doesn't end here.

166
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:09,130
You might now be wondering,
well,

167
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:12,490
how did California conquer audiences all
around the world?

168
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:13,443
I mean,
don't forget that back in the day that 

169
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:15,064
United States,
it wasn't the big powerhouse that it 

170
00:09:16,721 --> 00:09:18,450
would become later.
And don't forget,

171
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,560
countries like France,
countries like Denmark,

172
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,394
they already had a well funded industry.
So why did Hollywood achieve so much 

173
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,940
success and do it so quickly?
Well,

174
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:30,440
the answer lies in something called the 
network effects,

175
00:09:30,441 --> 00:09:32,550
and if you've been subscribed to this 
channel for a while,

176
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:33,403
you should do that by the way,
then the chances aren't even know what 

177
00:09:35,261 --> 00:09:36,130
this thing is.

178
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,063
All those Hollywood studios attracted 
the best investors and professionals 

179
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:40,754
from all around the globe.
This explains why in 1915 Hollywood was 

180
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,000
the setting for the first super 
production in history,

181
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,780
the birth of a nation,
a cost around a hundred thousand dollars

182
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,643
at that time.

183
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:56,770
That's miscellanea.
By the way,

184
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:57,604
this movie,
it was extremely controversial because 

185
00:09:59,071 --> 00:10:02,280
essentially it portrayed the KKK as the 
good guys,

186
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,173
but I mean,
that's an entire story for a different 

187
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,900
day.
The truth is that in less than 10 years,

188
00:10:06,901 --> 00:10:10,320
the population of Hollywood grew to more
than 30,000

189
00:10:10,321 --> 00:10:11,550
inhabitants.
Most of them,

190
00:10:11,551 --> 00:10:14,310
they were immigrants like Francisco 
alias this span.

191
00:10:14,330 --> 00:10:16,830
He came to Hollywood to work as a 
production assistant.

192
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:24,240
Soon he realized he could translate the 
titles of movies into Spanish this way,

193
00:10:24,241 --> 00:10:27,150
the good export them to Spain and Latin 
America,

194
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:29,550
other immigrants with other mother 
tongues did the same,

195
00:10:29,551 --> 00:10:33,510
and all of a sudden Hollywood movies 
could be understood everywhere.

196
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:35,253
Oh,

197
00:10:38,070 --> 00:10:40,530
but hold on just a second because I can 
guess what you're thinking.

198
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:41,483
Well,
what happens to the movies when they 

199
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:43,560
have sounds?
Well,

200
00:10:43,561 --> 00:10:44,394
actually this was a crucial turning 
points in the history of American 

201
00:10:46,561 --> 00:10:49,050
movies.
I blog now flows.

202
00:10:50,430 --> 00:10:53,610
Let's have a quick look as an example.
During the times of Nazi Germany,

203
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:54,473
the government,
they're invested a fortune in 

204
00:10:55,861 --> 00:10:56,694
subsidizing German studios,
and of course those companies trying to 

205
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:01,860
export their films to other countries 
like Spain.

206
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:06,030
Spain mounted the dictatorship of 
Francisco Franco was a close ally of the

207
00:11:06,031 --> 00:11:07,500
Third Reich.
Nonetheless,

208
00:11:07,501 --> 00:11:10,770
almost no Spanish movie theaters 
projected a German movie.

209
00:11:10,850 --> 00:11:12,210
That's why was this?
Well,

210
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,970
the reason is not as idealistic as you 
might hope.

211
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,893
It was a pure technological reason.
German studios sent their movies in the 

212
00:11:18,931 --> 00:11:21,390
German language and they didn't have 
good systems

213
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:26,510
out of my shell.

214
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:30,560
Hollywood studios instead had state of 
the art methods for Darby plus.

215
00:11:30,590 --> 00:11:32,870
Since they have such a high immigrant 
population,

216
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:35,990
it was easier for them to find 
translators and voice actors.

217
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:38,390
Some countries even had their own 
offices in Spain,

218
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:39,283
so they sent the cellular Lloyd ready to
be replaced with the Spanish audio 

219
00:11:41,841 --> 00:11:42,430
track.

220
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:43,740
There you go.
Yeah.

221
00:11:46,270 --> 00:11:48,040
They don't know about [inaudible].

222
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,423
In other words,
American movies were cheaper to 

223
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:00,840
projections and those from any other 
country.

224
00:12:00,980 --> 00:12:01,813
How did this,
the peerless talent of those movie 

225
00:12:02,971 --> 00:12:06,960
geniuses like John Ford who came from 
Ireland and Ernst Lubitsch who came from

226
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:07,794
Germany,
those were the ultimate weapons that 

227
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:11,760
drove America to surpass any other 
countries.

228
00:12:11,761 --> 00:12:12,594
Movie Industry.

229
00:12:15,570 --> 00:12:19,510
I sit at you liberty.
You pick it up.

230
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,210
Sorry.
Oh yes.

231
00:12:21,211 --> 00:12:22,044
Hollywood was born.
Thanks to those who came from outside 

232
00:12:23,971 --> 00:12:24,804
America and Hollywood grew up thanks to 
selling their movies to the people 

233
00:12:28,111 --> 00:12:28,720
outside.

234
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,760
If America at her,
everybody,

235
00:12:30,761 --> 00:12:32,260
I'm just country kill crazy.

236
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,193
And Tina,
it's really important that I make it 

237
00:12:33,831 --> 00:12:36,020
aside in case you've never heard about 
John Ford,

238
00:12:36,170 --> 00:12:39,560
do yourself a favor and watch the man 
who shot liberty valance.

239
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:41,900
It's the wonderful film and despite the 
black and white,

240
00:12:41,990 --> 00:12:42,890
it hasn't aged.

241
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:46,223
Show's over.

242
00:12:47,570 --> 00:12:50,760
And now the question might be,
what happens after all of this?

243
00:12:50,761 --> 00:12:54,570
How did Hollywood survive the censorship
and piracy that came later?

244
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:57,030
