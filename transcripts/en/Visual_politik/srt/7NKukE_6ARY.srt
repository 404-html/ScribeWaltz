1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:09,930
It's known as the lucky

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:11,023
train,

3
00:00:14,630 --> 00:00:17,330
amazing beaches,
a great deal of natural life spans,

4
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,250
many,
many natural resources.

5
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:24,680
This is Australia,
a surface paradise,

6
00:00:24,681 --> 00:00:26,180
and they send it to the sport of 
cricket.

7
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:27,053
For those who are unaware,
that's a British sport where there is 

8
00:00:28,721 --> 00:00:29,554
even a break for tea.
Australia is give us something special 

9
00:00:32,361 --> 00:00:34,990
and unique country.
Eighty percent of its plants and animals

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,833
don't exist anywhere else on the planet.
Everything is so different in Australia 

11
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:41,870
compared to the rest of the world,
but even its characteristic animal,

12
00:00:41,871 --> 00:00:45,650
the national symbol,
it doesn't even run or even fly.

13
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:46,773
It jumped.
Australia is a natural environment is 

14
00:00:53,631 --> 00:00:57,500
not only unique,
it's also rather terrifying.

15
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:00,460
Australia has more deadly things than 
any other place in the wells.

16
00:01:00,461 --> 00:01:01,294
For example,
all of the 10 most poisonous snakes in 

17
00:01:03,111 --> 00:01:05,870
the weld off from Australia.
Not enough evidence for you.

18
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,733
Well,
what about some other examples of the 

19
00:01:07,641 --> 00:01:12,410
deadly Australian ecosystem and have a 
look at these four animals,

20
00:01:12,730 --> 00:01:15,850
the funnel web,
spider box jellyfish,

21
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:18,700
the blue ringed octopus and the stone 
fish.

22
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,640
They're all in Australia and they're the
deadliest of their kind.

23
00:01:23,420 --> 00:01:24,770
Just be careful because,
well,

24
00:01:24,771 --> 00:01:25,850
there's much,
much more

25
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:31,810
crocodiles that weighed more than 1500 
kilograms sharks of all kinds and sizes,

26
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:35,990
and if animals don't scare you enough,
don't feel safe.

27
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:40,640
Yet there were many more natural dangers
of all kinds because this is a dry,

28
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:42,590
hot and aggressive climate.

29
00:01:43,230 --> 00:01:44,063
How would that.
None of these things have stopped 

30
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:47,470
Australia in any way from becoming a 
dream,

31
00:01:47,471 --> 00:01:49,830
the millions of people who dream of a 
better future.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,113
It's certainly logical.
I mean take a look at some of the 

33
00:01:53,021 --> 00:01:55,660
incredible places we can find in this 
country.

34
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,780
This is the gold coast.
I'll tell you,

35
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:03,643
we are not only referring to regular 
folks here who are heading to Australia 

36
00:02:06,131 --> 00:02:08,050
for a brighter future in the last few 
years.

37
00:02:08,051 --> 00:02:11,110
Australia has been like a magnet for 
millionaires as well,

38
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:14,500
but the big question is why to find out.
I'll be honest with that.

39
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:18,580
We're going to have to leave the animals
aside and talk to some business

40
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:21,900
Australia.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,210
Yeah,
a magnet for big fortune.

42
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:27,250
Everyday it gets easier to move around 
the world.

43
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:28,143
Today.
We can reach almost any place in a 

44
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:30,214
quick,
comfortable and affordable way for 

45
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:35,170
further thanks to the Internet and all 
kinds of new communication methods.

46
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,093
You can run a business from wherever you
want and just look at how things have 

47
00:02:39,341 --> 00:02:40,100
changed

48
00:02:40,100 --> 00:02:44,300
just 50 years ago for a trip between 
London and Sydney.

49
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,630
We have to make many stops on the way 
and it never took less than three days.

50
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:52,143
Same trip can now be done in much less 
time and a bit more than 20 hours on a 

51
00:02:56,461 --> 00:03:00,250
comfortable plain,
safe and with various films,

52
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,620
TV series and music.
You can arrive

53
00:03:04,940 --> 00:03:07,730
because of this increase in the ease of 
traveling communications,

54
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:11,210
wealthy business people have become more
demanding of their country,

55
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:12,380
of residence.
After all,

56
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:13,243
they can now easily choose where they 
prefer to live without it affecting 

57
00:03:16,101 --> 00:03:16,934
their business.
It's not only attractive taxes that 

58
00:03:19,071 --> 00:03:21,290
affect the choice of where a wealthy 
person lives.

59
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,680
They also want to live in places with 
high standards of living where it's easy

60
00:03:24,681 --> 00:03:25,514
to do business and whether a good 
schools as well as safety in terms of 

61
00:03:27,951 --> 00:03:30,440
both physical security as well as 
judicial safety.

62
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,600
The last meaning they can leave their 
savings safely,

63
00:03:32,601 --> 00:03:33,434
deposited somewhere safe in the 
knowledge that it won't be seized by a 

64
00:03:35,421 --> 00:03:37,430
corrupt politician or they've had an 
argument,

65
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,153
okay,

66
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,673
64 percent of Chinese millionaires have 
either immigrated or plan to immigrate 

67
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:48,620
taking their spending and their fortunes
with them

68
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:50,190
and Australia.
Wealth.

69
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:52,320
It has a lot to offer these 
millionaires.

70
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:55,260
On the one hand,
it is the fifth most free economy in the

71
00:03:55,261 --> 00:03:57,630
world.
It is very easy to do business that I'm.

72
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,180
There are plenty of opportunities for 
business.

73
00:04:00,210 --> 00:04:01,043
The justice system also works incredibly
well and it has a very competitive 

74
00:04:04,081 --> 00:04:07,290
financial system and regulations as a 
general rule.

75
00:04:10,270 --> 00:04:11,103
Plus on the other hand,
it's one of the countries with the 

76
00:04:12,641 --> 00:04:13,474
highest standard of living in the world 
because there are a huge number of 

77
00:04:16,781 --> 00:04:19,160
quality services like hospitals,
universities,

78
00:04:19,161 --> 00:04:19,510
and

79
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:20,343
cool.

80
00:04:21,070 --> 00:04:22,240
In fact,
year after year,

81
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,083
Australia's big cities maintain the 
highest positions in the international 

82
00:04:26,261 --> 00:04:29,260
rankings in terms of quality of life.
As an example,

83
00:04:29,290 --> 00:04:30,123
Melbourne for six years in a row now has
led the quality of life rankings as 

84
00:04:33,281 --> 00:04:37,150
compiled by the economist.
This means it must be a pretty wonderful

85
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:37,984
place.

86
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:42,510
I'm sweating.

87
00:04:42,710 --> 00:04:43,543
That wasn't enough.
The country recently created an open 

88
00:04:45,371 --> 00:04:48,110
door projects for people with 
significant fortunes

89
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:49,253
in Australia.
Millionaires willing to invest about 

90
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,044
three point $5,
million US dollars can obtain a 

91
00:04:53,911 --> 00:04:56,490
permanent residence card and if they 
fall a little bit short,

92
00:04:56,491 --> 00:04:57,324
if this three point $5,000,000 figure,
they can still get a lot of advantages 

93
00:05:00,301 --> 00:05:02,190
with $750,000.

94
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:03,640
Great

95
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,280
standards of living,
ease of doing business and open doors.

96
00:05:06,310 --> 00:05:08,470
What do you think the results of all of 
this has been?

97
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,120
Well,
that's pretty interesting.

98
00:05:10,210 --> 00:05:11,043
In both 2015 and 2016,
Australia has been the country whether 

99
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:15,813
most millionaires have moved to beating 
out even the United States in 2006 in 

100
00:05:20,411 --> 00:05:23,170
particular.
$11,000 million as moved to Australia,

101
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:28,200
which is an unbelievable figure for a 
country whose population is less than 25

102
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:29,123
million and honestly that might be the 
best indicator of the unstoppable 

103
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:32,973
Australian

104
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:33,893
economy.

105
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:40,560
Best version of the United States.

106
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:41,643
When you arrived in Australia,
some say that they feel they've arrived 

107
00:05:44,111 --> 00:05:46,570
and an improved version of the United 
States.

108
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:47,433
That is to say in general,
the city's system and society in both 

109
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,560
countries is quite similar.

110
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,190
Australia,
even as its own Washington DC,

111
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:58,820
a capital city built for and by the 
politically powerful.

112
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:03,920
Now some might forget,
but the capital city of Australia is not

113
00:06:03,921 --> 00:06:05,930
Sydney or Melbourne.
It's Canberra,

114
00:06:05,970 --> 00:06:06,803
right?

115
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:09,763
The truth is you could mistake Australia
for America at first if it wasn't for 

116
00:06:12,591 --> 00:06:13,424
the fact that cars are on the wrong side
of the roads and there are statues of 

117
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:19,270
Queen Victoria decorating the cities.
As an interesting aside,

118
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:20,123
it Australia is still technically a 
monarchy and it's queen this Queen 

119
00:06:23,350 --> 00:06:28,350
Elizabeth Second.
Well,

120
00:06:29,881 --> 00:06:32,190
the thing is that besides all of the 
similarities,

121
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:34,230
Australia is a safer,
cleaner,

122
00:06:34,290 --> 00:06:35,970
more modern,
more cosmopolitan,

123
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,013
more prosperous country,
and Australians are also richer than 

124
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:40,404
American.

125
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,680
When Australians visit the US,
they see a country in decline.

126
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,590
Australian see the bad airports,
the infrastructure,

127
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:47,900
the poor,
the becker.

128
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,893
Now maybe you can understand why people 
think Australia is something of an 

129
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:56,030
improved USA.
Generally speaking,

130
00:06:56,031 --> 00:06:58,970
international media doesn't pay a ton of
attention to Australia,

131
00:06:59,000 --> 00:06:59,833
but this really shouldn't be the case 
because this is a country that hasn't 

132
00:07:02,421 --> 00:07:05,900
seen an economic crisis in 26 years.
In fact,

133
00:07:05,901 --> 00:07:07,610
the last time the country went through a
crisis,

134
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,770
Gorbachev was in power in the Soviet 
Union.

135
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,993
No battery.

136
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:12,093
Yeah,
the phone that he had always thought of 

137
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,293
you.

138
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,320
No financial crisis like crisis over raw
materials.

139
00:07:19,321 --> 00:07:22,710
No unemployment's seemingly no problems 
at all in Australia.

140
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:23,663
And so the question is now,
what's the result of all of this 

141
00:07:26,041 --> 00:07:29,580
prosperity with a population of just 24 
million inhabitants,

142
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:34,610
it's economy is already as big as Russia
now.

143
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:37,383
It is also important to note that 
Australia is very dependent on its raw 

144
00:07:40,151 --> 00:07:40,984
materials.
They make up more than half of its 

145
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:42,994
exports.

146
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,373
20 19.
Australia will replace gutter as the 

147
00:07:46,451 --> 00:07:48,740
world's leading natural gas export.

148
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:51,420
So when the prices of raw material 
started to fall,

149
00:07:51,421 --> 00:07:52,254
it seems there's Australia would be 
facing a situation similar to those 

150
00:07:54,631 --> 00:07:55,980
which occurred in Russia,
Brazil,

151
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,210
Ecuador,
Saudi Arabia,

152
00:07:57,220 --> 00:07:58,053
et cetera.
It seemed as if the good times were 

153
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,550
about to come to an end,
but the reality,

154
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,920
the reality is entirely different.
In Australia,

155
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:07,890
unlike almost every other producing 
nation,

156
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,890
the crisis in raw materials didn't cause
any harm.

157
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,753
So what is it that makes Australia 
almost invulnerable to any kinds of 

158
00:08:14,971 --> 00:08:16,050
crisis?
Well,

159
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,973
let's have a look.

160
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:20,770
The secret of success.

161
00:08:23,020 --> 00:08:23,510
Lazy.

162
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,120
I regularly follow visual politic.
You already know that.

163
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,790
We like to say good policies,
good results,

164
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:32,840
but that is exactly what Australia has 
done in the last few decades.

165
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,840
They've had reformance.
The changes weren't many,

166
00:08:35,841 --> 00:08:38,180
so we'll just mention some of the most 
important ones.

167
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:40,160
First,
the government decided to battle opening

168
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:41,990
up the economy.
International Trade,

169
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:44,500
removing most terrorists.
The country is today,

170
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:46,790
a from defender of free trade 
agreements.

171
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,840
Exactly.
Seconds

172
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,910
in the early nineties,
the Labor is of poor.

173
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,570
Keating decided to start a retirement 
system known as super annuation based on

174
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:01,404
capitalization,
so each worker saves and invest a part 

175
00:09:03,961 --> 00:09:05,940
of their salary to pay for their 
retirements.

176
00:09:05,970 --> 00:09:06,803
In this way,
the Australian system is similar to the 

177
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:11,940
one in Chile.
The results are absolutely outstanding.

178
00:09:11,970 --> 00:09:12,803
The program has allowed people to 
generate large quantities of savings 

179
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,820
which have been invested in the 
productive economy.

180
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:21,180
Besides all this money saved has 
launched the finance industry.

181
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:22,073
For example,
Australia is already one of the most 

182
00:09:23,311 --> 00:09:28,311
important markets for investment funds 
and it isn't just that Australia has the

183
00:09:28,321 --> 00:09:31,290
world's highest growth rate for finance 
technology.

184
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:32,213
Third in 1995,
they started the national competition 

185
00:09:34,441 --> 00:09:35,274
policy,
the aim of which was to reduce state 

186
00:09:36,541 --> 00:09:40,350
interventionism in many sectors.
This program allowed for the elimination

187
00:09:40,351 --> 00:09:44,670
of almost 20,000 rules and regulations 
which restricted competition.

188
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:45,533
Also an ambitious program for 
privatization and the elimination of 

189
00:09:48,031 --> 00:09:51,090
state monopolies was launched and you 
want to know an example from this.

190
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:52,320
Well that would be quantified

191
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,320
today.
You're flying on a quad bike.

192
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:56,383
Yeah,

193
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,470
and three big major changes.
As in addition to that,

194
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:10,280
we also have budget stability in labor 
flexibility.

195
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,153
Then so on and so forth.
And so what has been the result of all 

196
00:10:14,341 --> 00:10:15,180
of this?
Well,

197
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:16,043
that's 25 years without a recession and 
economy with no unemployment as an 

198
00:10:19,230 --> 00:10:22,410
average salary of more than $5,000 a 
month.

199
00:10:22,470 --> 00:10:25,620
And that's not even mentioning the tons 
of foreign investment.

200
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,120
Sounds pretty good,
right?

201
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,320
Well,
we did visual politic.

202
00:10:28,350 --> 00:10:29,183
We will draw the conclusion that it is 
wrong for a country to blame the price 

203
00:10:31,771 --> 00:10:35,880
of raw materials for a financial crisis.
They simply didn't do their homework.

204
00:10:36,090 --> 00:10:37,530
And do you know who did do that?
Home work?

205
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,041
Wellbe?
Yeah,

206
00:10:38,041 --> 00:10:40,080
that's Australia.
So what do you think?

207
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:42,660
Do you think that Australia is a great 
destination for the wealthy?

208
00:10:42,661 --> 00:10:45,450
Do you think that the country could be 
to the 21st century?

209
00:10:45,451 --> 00:10:48,750
