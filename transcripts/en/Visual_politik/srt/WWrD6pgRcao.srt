1
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,310
Run out of these one of the most 
innovative companies on the planet,

2
00:00:10,311 --> 00:00:13,110
and yet it also manages to be one of the
most hated.

3
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:13,821
Yeah,
yeah.

4
00:00:13,821 --> 00:00:16,280
We've all heard of companies like tesla 
or hyperbole,

5
00:00:16,281 --> 00:00:17,420
but.
But let's be honest,

6
00:00:17,450 --> 00:00:21,170
it's going to be years before those 
companies actually change lives.

7
00:00:21,171 --> 00:00:24,590
If they ever,
dear ron and I have created a revolution

8
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:27,140
or ready and I'm not worried about 
European.

9
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:29,480
Ron has sway.
You can be felt worldwide,

10
00:00:29,660 --> 00:00:30,493
but on the other side of things,
it's hard to find someone who doesn't 

11
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:34,940
hate this ally.
This is partly due to the efforts of its

12
00:00:34,941 --> 00:00:36,560
CEO,
Michael O'leary.

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:37,513
He seems to have worked really hard to 
become the man you love to hate with 

14
00:00:40,370 --> 00:00:41,810
quotes like this one,

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:44,190
but we need fewer people queuing to go 
to the toilet.

16
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,280
How do you get fewer people queuing to 
go to the toilet,

17
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:49,290
charge them for it,
or how about this one?

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:53,110
Nobody wants to sit beside a really fat 
that's on board.

19
00:00:53,510 --> 00:00:54,343
We have been frankly astonished at the 
number of customers who don't only want 

20
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:59,580
to tax people,
but torture them.

21
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,440
Well,
it's actually another reason people hate

22
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:03,520
ron already.
If you've been following this channel,

23
00:01:03,521 --> 00:01:04,354
all my others,
you might already know that I live in 

24
00:01:05,621 --> 00:01:06,850
Prague,
in the Czech Republic.

25
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:08,380
Now,
why Paul is on this channel,

26
00:01:08,381 --> 00:01:11,440
they live over in Madrid,
in Spain and until there's a very month,

27
00:01:11,441 --> 00:01:13,990
the cost of a flight to go from here in 
Prague to Madrid,

28
00:01:14,170 --> 00:01:17,620
cost about 250 American dollars,
but this year,

29
00:01:17,621 --> 00:01:20,950
well Ryan and I came down and they 
managed to offer Prague to Madrid routes

30
00:01:20,951 --> 00:01:21,784
for about $90.
And what did the other airlines do in 

31
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,450
response to this?
Well,

32
00:01:25,451 --> 00:01:26,284
they were also forced to lower their 
prices and this didn't just happen 

33
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:32,290
between Progam Madrid.
This happened all across Europe.

34
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,500
Anywhere Ryan out operates the rest of 
it's competitors.

35
00:01:35,501 --> 00:01:38,770
Hats put down their prices in order to 
remain competitive.

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:41,890
This meant lower profits or even 
potential bankrupt.

37
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:42,743
Let's see.

38
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,120
Just to have a look at British Airways 
in the year 2000,

39
00:01:49,121 --> 00:01:49,954
they carried over 46 million passengers,
but just eight years later they didn't 

40
00:01:52,961 --> 00:01:55,210
even carry 33 million.
And of course,

41
00:01:55,211 --> 00:01:58,810
those big airlines like British Airways 
or Lufthansa or Iberia,

42
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:01,570
they spent a fortune buying ads in the 
media and well,

43
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,110
because it was ad buy,
they want the love of journalists sand.

44
00:02:05,111 --> 00:02:05,501
Well,
you know,

45
00:02:05,501 --> 00:02:07,350
you didn't have much love from 
journalists.

46
00:02:07,351 --> 00:02:10,720
Well that would be ryanair because they 
never really bought any apps.

47
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,340
Well,
despite this bad reputation,

48
00:02:12,341 --> 00:02:16,540
there are only a few companies that can 
claim to have changed an entire industry

49
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:19,360
the way that Ryan did.
And as I said before,

50
00:02:19,361 --> 00:02:20,194
this is not only a European thing,
Ryan air effects can be felt around the 

51
00:02:23,741 --> 00:02:26,410
wells except perhaps in Latin America.

52
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,840
So the first question we have to ask 
here is,

53
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,340
how did Ryan ever changed the world?
Why do regions like Latin America need a

54
00:02:38,341 --> 00:02:40,890
company like this?
Most important of all,

55
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:44,700
how does Ryan App managed to author 
these ludicrously low prices?

56
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,623
Well,
today we are going to answer all those 

57
00:02:46,351 --> 00:02:47,184
questions,
but first let's take a look back at the 

58
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:53,340
history.
Why is Ryan Air so cheap?

59
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:54,203
Back in the 19 eighties and Madrid 
salons in flight cost the equivalent of 

60
00:02:56,371 --> 00:03:00,850
$700 back then in Spain.
This was the average monthly wage.

61
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:03,760
Everyone understood that flying well.
It was a luxury.

62
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:09,670
I mean at the end of the day,
planes,

63
00:03:09,671 --> 00:03:12,940
they're really expensive and there 
wasn't really anything anyone could do.

64
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:13,803
Nevertheless,
the reason why flights with that 

65
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:18,910
expensive actually had little to do with
the technology and just had much more to

66
00:03:18,911 --> 00:03:23,720
do with politics.
Yes,

67
00:03:23,721 --> 00:03:26,110
this really is true because back then 
average,

68
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,280
they will based on agreements between 
governments.

69
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,233
For instance,
the French government and the American 

70
00:03:30,681 --> 00:03:31,700
one,
they had a deal,

71
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:32,593
so only French and American airlines 
could fly between Paris and New York 

72
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:37,393
City.
The same happens with the rest of the 

73
00:03:38,751 --> 00:03:40,700
European countries.
Airlines.

74
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:43,580
They had essentially a monopoly over the
roots that they operate,

75
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,393
so there really was no incentive for 
them to lower fares because they could 

76
00:03:52,801 --> 00:03:55,530
simply make a fortune selling $700 
tickets.

77
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,990
Back then it was really only British and
Irish people.

78
00:03:57,991 --> 00:04:00,120
You could enjoy it,
Ryan as lower fares,

79
00:04:00,270 --> 00:04:03,510
but then in April of 19,
97 things,

80
00:04:03,570 --> 00:04:04,630
they changed for

81
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:12,380
any technically qualified airline in the
European Union.

82
00:04:12,470 --> 00:04:13,303
Plus,
Norway and Iceland will be able to run 

83
00:04:14,631 --> 00:04:16,970
services inside any other country.

84
00:04:17,070 --> 00:04:19,080
All of a sudden,
all these European carriers,

85
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:22,650
they could compete against each other.
They didn't really know how.

86
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:26,700
This is why they are heavily invested in
advertising and more luxuries.

87
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:27,593
They make that a food more comfortable 
seats and even gave corporate gifts to 

88
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,120
passengers.
Ronna instead,

89
00:04:33,150 --> 00:04:35,130
they.
That's on a totally different strategy.

90
00:04:40,820 --> 00:04:43,400
Airlines are asking how they can put up 
barriers.

91
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,280
We are asking how we could get rid of 
them

92
00:04:46,450 --> 00:04:49,390
saying this in 1997,
it was totally crazy.

93
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,253
Of course there were already on the 
budget guidelines like the American 

94
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:53,550
Airlines,
southwest,

95
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,140
but runner,
they wanted to go even further.

96
00:04:56,170 --> 00:05:00,040
This is why they found new ways to 
reduce the costs to an absolute minimum.

97
00:05:00,250 --> 00:05:01,083
For example,
the landing cost depended partly on the 

98
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:05,200
of the town lines,
paid to the airports landing.

99
00:05:05,201 --> 00:05:08,860
It's Brussels central lab is costly,
but 60 kilometers south,

100
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,713
if there is Charlotte Roy airports which
offers way lower landing fees simply by 

101
00:05:13,030 --> 00:05:15,410
choosing to fly to that airport.
Ryan at,

102
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:20,460
they saved another cost saving policy,
was utilizing the same athlete model for

103
00:05:24,340 --> 00:05:27,400
all of the roots and this airplane.
It was the Boeing seven,

104
00:05:27,401 --> 00:05:29,770
three,
seven other companies like Lufthansa,

105
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,440
they worked with over 14 different types
of airplanes.

106
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:35,170
This means they needed 14 maintenance 
technicians.

107
00:05:35,290 --> 00:05:38,370
Each of them are specialized on a 
different model of aircraft.

108
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:39,383
Ronna instead,
they could do the same with just a few 

109
00:05:41,171 --> 00:05:42,004
experts.
This means that while Lufthansa needed 

110
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:45,940
hours between flights,
do maintenance checks,

111
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:51,060
Ryanair needed half that time,
and of course after this,

112
00:05:52,921 --> 00:05:53,754
the rest of the extra costs that they 
saved during the flights do you want to 

113
00:05:56,221 --> 00:05:57,380
use on the airplane?
Well,

114
00:05:57,381 --> 00:05:58,214
that's extra.
Do you want to carry on baggage that's 

115
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:03,860
extra to you.
Want to choose your seats every year,

116
00:06:03,861 --> 00:06:06,830
Ron and finds new ways to reduce costs.
For instance,

117
00:06:06,831 --> 00:06:08,630
a few years ago on the backs of their 
seats,

118
00:06:08,631 --> 00:06:09,464
they started posting adverts,
but the real turning points in this 

119
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:13,154
company came in the year 2000.
This was the time when Michael O'leary 

120
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:20,460
made a decision that changed the entire 
industry for

121
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:21,573
bye.

122
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,050
The travel agents take the out and shoot
them.

123
00:06:25,260 --> 00:06:27,780
What have they done for passengers over 
the last years in the year?

124
00:06:27,781 --> 00:06:28,614
2,000 runner was the first company to 
create a website where you could book 

125
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:32,483
tickets online.
Prior to that it was impossible to buy 

126
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:37,650
your own plane ticket unless you lived 
close to the airport.

127
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:40,560
So travel agents,
they were a pretty essential middleman.

128
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,453
And of course these travel agents,
they've charged commissions and these 

129
00:06:43,831 --> 00:06:44,664
conditions went up to 30 percent now in 
stats passengers could just go to the 

130
00:06:48,091 --> 00:06:50,900
website to find the cheapest flights.
And then bias,

131
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,800
do they.
This is completely normal,

132
00:06:52,801 --> 00:06:56,370
but back then it was a revolution and 
they put lots of travel agents,

133
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:59,100
business with all of this.
By the year 2010,

134
00:06:59,101 --> 00:06:59,934
Ron,
eh could offer tickets for an average 

135
00:07:01,231 --> 00:07:03,460
price of 40 US dollars.
I mean,

136
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:04,313
that's cheap,
but it's pretty ridiculous when you 

137
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:08,520
consider these $700 to get the we were 
talking about before.

138
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,521
All right?
All right.

139
00:07:12,521 --> 00:07:14,980
So now you might be wondering,
why aren't we saying cheap flights,

140
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,180
uh,
such a revolution.

141
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:17,283
Think about it.
Since Ryanair extended its business in 

142
00:07:18,911 --> 00:07:21,820
Europe,
the amount of passengers has tripled.

143
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:22,863
Pay attention to the chart here because 
we're talking about much more than 

144
00:07:25,241 --> 00:07:26,074
tourism here.

145
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:27,480
Okay,

146
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:30,593
thanks to cheap flights.
Students exchange programs have 

147
00:07:32,431 --> 00:07:35,610
multiplied by five since 2007.
In fact,

148
00:07:35,611 --> 00:07:37,920
if you are watching this video from 
anywhere in Europe,

149
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,813
you might have studied abroad with an 
erasmus programme or have a friend do 

150
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,830
did,
and the same goes for labor mobility,

151
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:44,723
which has tripled in a decade.
It would be hard to measure all the 

152
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:50,100
small businesses that have been born 
thanks to cheap flights.

153
00:07:50,250 --> 00:07:53,700
They can even allow the most modest 
freelancer to find clients and another.

154
00:07:53,701 --> 00:07:53,840
Okay.

155
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,673
I'm sorry,

156
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,070
hold on for just a minute because 
there's another detail that we must keep

157
00:08:01,071 --> 00:08:02,670
in mindset.
If you look carefully,

158
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:05,210
you will see that while flying has 
increased in Europe,

159
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,213
Latin America seems to be immune to 
those changes and didn't like to say 

160
00:08:09,951 --> 00:08:12,440
that the air effects it was worldwide.
I mean,

161
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:17,500
well what happens in Latin America,
the Ryanair effect.

162
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:21,260
I know what you're thinking.
Ronnette just operates in Europe.

163
00:08:21,261 --> 00:08:23,210
I mean,
how could they have such a big influence

164
00:08:23,211 --> 00:08:24,950
on the rest of the wells?
Well,

165
00:08:24,951 --> 00:08:27,620
I'll let you draw your own conclusions.
Take Airasia.

166
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:30,560
They were an airline owned by the 
Malaysian government at the beginning of

167
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:33,350
the two thousands that you want on the 
verge of bankruptcy.

168
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,810
Then in 2011,
the Malaysian businessmen,

169
00:08:35,811 --> 00:08:36,644
Tony Fernandez bought it and followed 
the Ryanair model that it started to 

170
00:08:40,191 --> 00:08:43,310
work in Europe and Asia.
They adopted the slogan and now everyone

171
00:08:43,311 --> 00:08:47,150
can fly and they offered to the first 
low cost flights on the continents.

172
00:08:47,390 --> 00:08:51,410
Suddenly Corolla the important Macau 
could be done for less than $90.

173
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,980
It happened Europe,
Asia then

174
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:56,813
sold the birth of many other low cost 
airlines from lion era of Indonesia to 

175
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,013
Cebu Pacific and the Philippines.
Even a country as poor and as big as 

176
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:05,033
India has seen it,
the amount of passengers triple in just 

177
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,760
10 years.

178
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,913
Hold on again for just a minute because 
there's still that pulse of the planet 

179
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:18,440
which seems immune to the Ryan Air 
Effects and this area as we mentioned,

180
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,274
whether it's Latin America for example,
a cheap flight between Bogota or in 

181
00:09:21,981 --> 00:09:22,814
Colombia and Mexico City costs $460.
John's compare that with the $86 that 

182
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,630
you could pay going from quality 
important Taipei,

183
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:32,540
and in case you want to check the 
distance,

184
00:09:32,541 --> 00:09:33,710
both are more or less than

185
00:09:34,030 --> 00:09:35,300
dot,

186
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:41,560
and the same goes if you want to go from
Libor and Peru to La Paz in Bolivia.

187
00:09:41,710 --> 00:09:45,370
This is a three hour flight and it costs
$600 and yes,

188
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,720
this is more than the average monthly 
wage in most Latin American countries.

189
00:09:49,930 --> 00:09:50,763
So now you might be wondering why is it 
so damn expensive to fly in Latin 

190
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:55,923
America?
Why don't they have some Ryanair like 

191
00:09:56,980 --> 00:09:59,560
company?
The answer lies again in politics.

192
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:00,543
In other words,
legislation in the region has made it 

193
00:10:02,111 --> 00:10:07,111
impossible for a company to appear.
If an airline wants to work in Brazil,

194
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,563
they need to have at least 20 percent of
their capital owned by resilience and 

195
00:10:16,201 --> 00:10:18,600
two years ago this percentage,
it was even higher.

196
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:19,463
This is why it went avianca re,
Colombian carrier wanted to open two 

197
00:10:22,081 --> 00:10:22,914
markets in the country.
The government forced them to start a 

198
00:10:25,051 --> 00:10:27,480
brand new company with their 
headquarters in Brazil.

199
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,910
Thus Avianca runs Avianca,
Brazil,

200
00:10:29,911 --> 00:10:30,744
all two entirely different companies.
Despite the fact that they do belong to 

201
00:10:33,631 --> 00:10:34,464
the same group that Brazil,
that'll be any country that protects 

202
00:10:36,421 --> 00:10:37,254
their analysis.

203
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,250
Year 2016,
Argentenians wanted to fly.

204
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:48,140
I could only choose between two 
companies.

205
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,033
Argentina,
Lat am a private carrier and outer your 

206
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:52,163
lineage.
Argentina's a state owned airline for 

207
00:10:54,291 --> 00:10:55,124
decades that Christina Fernandez,
the administration made sure no other 

208
00:10:59,781 --> 00:11:01,940
airline could compete with these 
airlines,

209
00:11:02,090 --> 00:11:05,640
and the same goes for the airports,
the that could cut costs.

210
00:11:05,641 --> 00:11:07,940
It's thanks to you taking off and 
landing at airports.

211
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,923
Well,
this is possibly in Europe because one 

212
00:11:10,311 --> 00:11:11,144
out of every four airport,
some managed by a marriage between the 

213
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:15,350
government and private companies.

214
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,153
Thanks to this airports must compete 
with each other by offering better 

215
00:11:22,261 --> 00:11:25,980
services and love affairs.
It's not by chance that half of European

216
00:11:25,981 --> 00:11:26,814
air traffic comes from private airports.
Latin America though it's a different 

217
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:30,504
story.
Most of their airports are managed 

218
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,560
solely by the governments.
If there is no competition,

219
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,990
they simply have no interest in reducing
fats.

220
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,680
And other words Brian Enter is failed to
have an effect on this region because of

221
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,230
politics and well.
What are the consequences of this?

222
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:45,540
Well,
despite the fact that there's many Latin

223
00:11:45,540 --> 00:11:48,150
American countries have grown 
economically in the past few years,

224
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,820
flying is still a privilege for the 
rich.

225
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:54,100
This is my vision.
I've been to the mountaintop.

226
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:54,940
I've seen the lights.

227
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,673
Now the question becomes,
do you think Latin America should 

228
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:02,050
liberalize its aspects?
Do you think that everyone could benefit

229
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:04,990
from a company like Ron out operating in
his own country?

230
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:05,980
Well,
please do it.
