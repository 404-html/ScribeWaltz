1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible].

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:08,923
Okay.
Before we get started with today's 

3
00:00:09,561 --> 00:00:11,480
video,
I've got to give you two warnings.

4
00:00:11,481 --> 00:00:12,314
The first is that we might include some 
spoilers about narcos on via sleep or 

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,720
given that it's a TV show based on real 
history,

6
00:00:17,870 --> 00:00:18,703
I don't think this is so much of a 
problem and the second warning is that 

7
00:00:21,081 --> 00:00:23,240
today we're going to talk about drug 
trafficking,

8
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:24,193
a topic where the information we have is
pretty incomplete and all the time 

9
00:00:27,051 --> 00:00:27,884
police to finding new bits of 
information that could prove parts of 

10
00:00:29,901 --> 00:00:30,920
this video wrong.

11
00:00:34,870 --> 00:00:35,810
Tell you.
That being said,

12
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,530
let's move on to Colombia.
The country that is known of the country

13
00:00:39,531 --> 00:00:42,990
of a thousand rhythms,
the country of coffee and the birthplace

14
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:46,550
of so many of those Latino singers that 
got the whole world to dance.

15
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,413
Nevertheless,
what really made this country famous is 

16
00:00:49,521 --> 00:00:54,521
sadly this man [inaudible] video 
[inaudible] the king of cocaine,

17
00:00:56,990 --> 00:01:01,010
the man who basically created one of the
world's most dangerous industries at the

18
00:01:01,011 --> 00:01:03,840
ends of the 1980s Pablo Escobar or El 
Patron,

19
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:06,050
as his neighbors used to know him,
controlled it,

20
00:01:06,051 --> 00:01:09,380
and 90% of the worldwide production of 
cocaine.

21
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:13,310
Suddenly it met a Yin and a city of 2 
million inhabitants became the Hollywood

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:14,720
of cocaine.
However,

23
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:19,130
on December the first 1993 he died 
during a shootout with the police.

24
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,590
But well,
you've probably already knew that.

25
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:23,700
So the question now becomes,
well,

26
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:27,170
what happens after Pablo who took his 
business?

27
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:29,510
Ma'Ams then there is the most important 
question of all,

28
00:01:29,660 --> 00:01:30,493
and that is,
is there still cocaine trafficking in 

29
00:01:32,691 --> 00:01:33,650
Columbia?
Well,

30
00:01:33,651 --> 00:01:35,900
today we're certainly going to answer 
all of those questions,

31
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:40,190
but before we get into any of that,
let's talk a little bit about cocaine.

32
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,733
Yeah,

33
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:49,490
weed.
Cocaine is the second most consumed drug

34
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:50,353
in the world,
but it's unlike the first one that 

35
00:01:51,561 --> 00:01:54,470
cocaine is extremely hard to find 
marijuana.

36
00:01:54,500 --> 00:01:55,333
It groves anywhere on the planet,
even in cold places like North America 

37
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,143
grow houses are found all the time.
And with just a little bit of 

38
00:02:01,881 --> 00:02:02,714
expenditure,
anyone can create at home the optimal 

39
00:02:05,271 --> 00:02:08,240
conditions for growing cannabis.
That's coca leaves.

40
00:02:08,270 --> 00:02:12,230
They are a different animal.
You need a very specific habitat to grow

41
00:02:12,231 --> 00:02:13,064
them.
And this is why only some countries can 

42
00:02:14,871 --> 00:02:17,180
grow these leaves,
but the main countries are Colombia.

43
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,740
Peru and Bolivia ship.

44
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:23,620
Cool.

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:26,920
Okay.
In other words,

46
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:29,830
there is just space for a few suppliers,
but on the other hand,

47
00:02:29,831 --> 00:02:32,680
the demand,
it won't stop growing as well.

48
00:02:32,710 --> 00:02:33,543
It's a gullible demands.
This is why it cocaine is such a high 

49
00:02:36,131 --> 00:02:36,964
profit business,
and this is why right after Pablo 

50
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:40,413
Escobar's death,
there were lots of people willing to 

51
00:02:41,741 --> 00:02:42,850
take his place.

52
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:46,620
[inaudible] feel

53
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:48,000
bores.
As you know,

54
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:50,700
probably West Guevara was the leader of 
the median cartel,

55
00:02:50,750 --> 00:02:51,583
but even before his death,
there was already a second cocaine 

56
00:02:54,061 --> 00:02:56,400
capital,
and that was the city of Cali,

57
00:02:56,530 --> 00:02:59,980
also in Columbia and with a very similar
population.

58
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:02,330
We're Pablo left a trail of bodies and 
chaos.

59
00:03:02,331 --> 00:03:03,164
Since week Kelly May problems disappear 
with an army of lawyers and a mountain 

60
00:03:06,411 --> 00:03:08,990
of legal briefs.
Met Him.

61
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,300
Cartel was Miami,
swimming pools,

62
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,750
bikini girls.
Taki is a two tone cadillac.

63
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,590
The Cali cartel was New York,
elegant,

64
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,120
smooth,
subtle,

65
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:21,883
where they can fuel the 24 hour night,
live with cocaine and still make sure 

66
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,690
everybody showed up for work on Wall 
Street.

67
00:03:26,691 --> 00:03:27,524
The next morning,
the first met Ian and Kelly works side 

68
00:03:31,071 --> 00:03:35,150
by side,
but in Colombia when money's involved,

69
00:03:35,420 --> 00:03:36,740
blood inevitably flows.

70
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:39,003
The Cali cartel,
they wanted to take the whole of 

71
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:41,284
Escobar's business that many in plenty 
of Narcos who wants to do the same 

72
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:47,470
thing.
One of them with Diego Fernandez,

73
00:03:47,471 --> 00:03:49,140
Marillo Aka dawn.

74
00:03:49,310 --> 00:03:50,143
Bye now.

75
00:03:54,110 --> 00:03:54,943
It helps the police deal with Pablo 
Escobar and made an alliance with the 

76
00:03:57,351 --> 00:03:58,184
Cali cartel.
I'd even had close ties with a right 

77
00:04:00,291 --> 00:04:05,030
wing paramilitary group called the 
Colombian self defense forces with Pablo

78
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:05,863
Escobar dead and buried.
Don dunner started a new organization 

79
00:04:07,731 --> 00:04:10,330
with this paramilitary group,
the so called office center,

80
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:12,140
Dan Vergano.
At the same time,

81
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,780
smaller narcos in metagene.
We're also fighting for their share.

82
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,250
The street you see on the screen was the
border between one band.

83
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:20,113
Yeah.

84
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:24,360
Basically,

85
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,350
if you were a worker for the ovc now the
end de Gallo and cross the street,

86
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,303
someone would kill you immediately.
So as you can imagine that these were 

87
00:04:32,311 --> 00:04:35,550
extremely violent times for the city,
different drug bands,

88
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:37,920
or killing each other pretty much all 
the time.

89
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,830
Meanwhile,
the Cali cartel was way more subtle.

90
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:43,470
This is Gilberto Rodriguez and his 
partner,

91
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:44,304
Pasho Herrera.
They were high class buyers with plenty 

92
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:48,720
of contact,
some on politicians and judges.

93
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,673
In fact,
Gilberto Rodriguez paid over $6 million 

94
00:04:51,841 --> 00:04:52,674
to finance the campaign of one of the 
Colombian presidents anesto Santa's 

95
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,083
nonetheless,
despite beautifully when it's in the 

96
00:04:57,871 --> 00:05:00,750
corruption after sometime the inevitable
happens.

97
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:01,411
Yes,
Sonia,

98
00:05:01,411 --> 00:05:02,244
I'll go.
We are not.

99
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,673
Government has started the extradition 
process for the chief of the Cali 

100
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:10,800
cartel.
Nonetheless,

101
00:05:10,801 --> 00:05:11,634
dawn burner volunteers.
He was at a totally different story 

102
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,920
among all the characters that appear on 
the Narcos TV show.

103
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:21,720
Dawn burner is the one who has lost the 
longest without being put behind bars,

104
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:22,613
but we're just a minute because now we 
can talk about in the characters that 

105
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:26,940
didn't appear on the show at least in 
the first two seasons,

106
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:28,890
and to prepare yourself because,
well,

107
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:29,970
there's a lot to tell.

108
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,830
Remember how don burner was working with
this right wing group?

109
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:33,683
Well,
the political ideology was more 

110
00:05:34,831 --> 00:05:36,810
important than what you might think for 
this group.

111
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:37,673
The Colombian self defense forces.
They were born to fight against 

112
00:05:40,771 --> 00:05:42,600
communist guerrillas in the country.

113
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:45,970
Collusionary

114
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,600
armed forces of Colombia,
Fark Fark.

115
00:05:49,660 --> 00:05:52,030
It's more than just a simple terrorist 
group.

116
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,983
In some areas of the country,
they became a parallel government more 

117
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:56,764
than an Alpha eater kind of thing.
They could be better comparison with 

118
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,620
dash or Islamic state.
Even today,

119
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,454
a good parts of the Colombian rainforest
is under the control of this Marxist 

120
00:06:03,951 --> 00:06:05,240
Leninist group.
Fox,

121
00:06:05,241 --> 00:06:07,190
they had their own doctors,
their own hospitals,

122
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:09,770
and of course they collected their own 
taxes.

123
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:11,983
This group has over 20,000
members spread across 24 of Columbia's 

124
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,160
32 provinces.
As you can imagine,

125
00:06:19,161 --> 00:06:19,994
Fox,
they were not good friends of drug 

126
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,160
trafficking.
Yes,

127
00:06:22,161 --> 00:06:24,710
drug traffic isn't terrorists.
They do have common enemies,

128
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:25,603
but the idea of becoming a millionaire 
by selling a product on the 

129
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:30,740
international market doesn't sound very 
Marxist.

130
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,190
Besides extortion and kidnapping,
they were pretty lucrative businesses as

131
00:06:34,191 --> 00:06:37,040
well as FARC.
They were experts on these matters.

132
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:39,470
Add to this,
the fact that don burner and this office

133
00:06:39,471 --> 00:06:42,830
seen to and vanguard who had an 
anticommunist group on their site,

134
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:46,070
and you can imagine that the war,
it was about to happen,

135
00:06:46,370 --> 00:06:49,220
but with this

136
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,420
is the boy,
Huh?

137
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:52,560
Municipality.
I data today,

138
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,710
it's covered by plants and trees.
That is the north,

139
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:59,640
apart from where bark launched rockets 
to the other part of the municipality,

140
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,900
but well,
business is business and the mass of the

141
00:07:01,901 --> 00:07:02,734
money for could make with kidnapping.
It was hard to resist the temptation of 

142
00:07:06,041 --> 00:07:08,800
drug trafficking.
So one day Mudita [inaudible] has one of

143
00:07:08,801 --> 00:07:12,340
the main thought leaders decided to try 
in the cocaine business.

144
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:13,493
Yes.

145
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,383
Jean Front of the FARC went from 200 
members to over 800 due to cocaine 

146
00:07:21,891 --> 00:07:24,510
revenue,
which became one of the primary ways the

147
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:26,360
Koreas finance their activities.

148
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:30,720
Don't forget the FARC have the control 
of all the areas where coca plantations,

149
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:33,450
where in fact they had already extorted 
the growers.

150
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:35,750
Nonetheless with Medina,
Caracas is leader.

151
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:40,170
FARC have created their own fields and 
their own distribution networks.

152
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:43,410
This was all happening by the year 2000 
at this time,

153
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,630
the Cali cartel,
it was already dismantled,

154
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,613
but cocaine,
it was still employing a good share of 

155
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:49,860
the Colombian workforce.

156
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:53,961
Well,
to summarize,

157
00:07:53,961 --> 00:07:54,794
on the one hand,
we have the office sooner to envision 

158
00:07:55,960 --> 00:08:00,740
Gado with don burner as the leader and 
then we have FARC on the other hands and

159
00:08:00,741 --> 00:08:04,880
between these two there's also a 
plethora of independent drug trafficking

160
00:08:04,881 --> 00:08:05,714
bands called the backroom.
It was during this time the Columbia 

161
00:08:08,331 --> 00:08:09,164
chosen you president's Alvara rebate.
Early Bay was born in Midian and this 

162
00:08:12,681 --> 00:08:15,860
political goal was to end all the 
violence am's.

163
00:08:15,861 --> 00:08:16,694
Well,
this marks the beginning of the tox 

164
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:22,093
mafioso oh Volvo or rebate.
Was it ready to end the guerrilla 

165
00:08:25,041 --> 00:08:28,160
warriors and the right wing groups at 
any cost.

166
00:08:28,190 --> 00:08:29,023
This is why in the year 2005 is Defense 
Minister Camilo or Spina signed the law 

167
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:35,420
that is thought of with sadness in 
Colombia.

168
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,170
This law was directive zero to nine and 
as well.

169
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,460
Now you might be wondering,
well,

170
00:08:40,461 --> 00:08:43,230
what's so sad about that?
It sounds like it could be a good thing.

171
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,153
This directive said literally that the 
government would give the equivalent of 

172
00:08:47,431 --> 00:08:48,264
1900 US dollars to anyone who would 
murder a guerrilla fighter or a 

173
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,540
paramilitary,
right wing fighter.

174
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:58,930
Sure.
Basically,

175
00:08:58,931 --> 00:09:00,810
if you were a soldier in the Colombian 
army ends,

176
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:01,653
you wanted to have a good career.
All you had to do was get out and go on 

177
00:09:04,361 --> 00:09:06,250
a man Hans,
and all of a sudden,

178
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:08,730
well,
the death toll at Fark Ama narcos,

179
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:09,573
it absolutely skyrocketed,
but hold on a minute because this was 

180
00:09:12,341 --> 00:09:14,470
just the beginning.
Finding FARC members,

181
00:09:14,530 --> 00:09:15,363
it wasn't an easy job,
but the rewards given by the Colombian 

182
00:09:17,801 --> 00:09:20,170
government was really,
really tempting.

183
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,680
This is why a lots of soldiers started 
killing innocent civilians.

184
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,723
After that,
they would dress the metaphoric uniform 

185
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:27,243
and take a picture of the dad's body.
This was enough to go to the government 

186
00:09:30,161 --> 00:09:30,994
office and gets the money and this is 
something that happens way more than 

187
00:09:33,911 --> 00:09:36,070
once or twice.
There is even a name for it.

188
00:09:36,071 --> 00:09:36,904
In Colombia,
the dad civilians were called false 

189
00:09:38,471 --> 00:09:42,310
positives and it became a major way for 
people to make money in Colombia.

190
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:43,263
It's still today,
the Colombian justice system has over 

191
00:09:45,401 --> 00:09:49,660
3000 ongoing cases of false positives 
that need to be investigated.

192
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:52,030
But wait a minute,
because while the policies of presidents

193
00:09:52,031 --> 00:09:54,190
or rebate,
we're extremely controversial,

194
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:58,630
one thing has to be set.
He made it way more complicated for FARC

195
00:09:58,631 --> 00:10:01,480
guerrilla warriors,
raids on cocaine fields and distribution

196
00:10:01,481 --> 00:10:02,980
networks.
They became the norm.

197
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,590
And when your enemy is killing dozens of
your members,

198
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:09,460
you are willing to sign an alliance with
the devil himself.

199
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,203
Some emails prove the links between the 
FARC and the narco traffickers and one 

200
00:10:18,231 --> 00:10:19,064
of the messages and Middle Kaneko Oh 
Korea leader shows a clear connection 

201
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,970
with the OPC and the end of the Godell.

202
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,833
As we said before,
fuck would present at all the 

203
00:10:32,041 --> 00:10:33,720
plantations.
In some cases,

204
00:10:33,721 --> 00:10:36,500
those plantations,
they belonged to the office scene to end

205
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:39,990
Gatto or some belongs to the back room 
that we mentioned earlier.

206
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:43,310
On the other hand,
sometimes patients were managed directly

207
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,153
by fog.
These aren't where they grew and 

208
00:10:45,901 --> 00:10:49,230
processed cocoa leaves and turns them 
into white powder.

209
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:50,123
Then the big cartels steps into 
distributes the cocaine to other 

210
00:10:52,801 --> 00:10:54,120
countries.
Nonetheless,

211
00:10:54,150 --> 00:10:54,983
unlike the times of Pablo Escobar,
Colombian cartels and no longer have a 

212
00:10:57,391 --> 00:11:02,391
monopoly over distribution.
For instance,

213
00:11:03,631 --> 00:11:07,710
when those Columbia narcos want to send 
[inaudible] to the u s they partner with

214
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,570
Mexican drug dealers when they want to 
send it to Europe.

215
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,470
They work with Italian,
Greek and Albanian mafias,

216
00:11:13,530 --> 00:11:16,500
but we're going to talk about all of 
that in another video and not today.

217
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,533
The important thing is,
despite drug trafficking still being an 

218
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:23,000
issue today,
metagene is now a peaceful city.

219
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,953
Of course,
there are still bad neighborhoods where 

220
00:11:24,951 --> 00:11:27,560
it's better not to walk through,
especially on the outskirts of the city,

221
00:11:27,890 --> 00:11:31,100
but the city has made a big change 
change for the better.

222
00:11:31,220 --> 00:11:32,053
This pax mafioso has allowed all the 
players involved with the cocaine 

223
00:11:34,851 --> 00:11:35,684
business to make an agreement so that 
each of them has their territories and 

224
00:11:38,721 --> 00:11:40,670
they have no reason to kill each other.
Yes,

225
00:11:40,671 --> 00:11:41,504
cocaine is now easier to find than ever.
There's less people die during the 

226
00:11:44,811 --> 00:11:45,280
process.

227
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,113
Awesome.

228
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:52,090
Now,
you might be wondering,

229
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:52,953
well,
what can happen that FARC have made a 

230
00:11:54,311 --> 00:11:56,710
peace agreements with the Colombian 
government?

231
00:11:56,740 --> 00:11:58,480
Well,
this could become an opportunity for the

232
00:11:58,481 --> 00:11:59,314
background to take back control of the 
business that is now in the qubit as 

233
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,250
Hams,
but the truth is these Nike's,

234
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,223
they're also trying to get a peace 
agreement with the government that is 

235
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:07,894
just as profitable as the one that 
fucking and negotiating crazy as it 

236
00:12:10,691 --> 00:12:14,920
sounds for claims to be a political 
group with their ideology and propaganda

237
00:12:14,950 --> 00:12:17,720
even available on their website,
which can be visited by anyone.

238
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:19,910
This is

239
00:12:19,910 --> 00:12:21,800
why they sit on equal terms with the 
government.

240
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:22,663
However,
backroom are seen as normal criminals 

241
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:27,830
with no politics or ideology whatsoever.

242
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:28,661
Ads,
of course,

243
00:12:28,661 --> 00:12:30,250
well days norcos they're thinking,
hey,

244
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,900
why can fox or with the governments and 
why can't we?

245
00:12:33,050 --> 00:12:35,050
The agreements between the FARC and the 
government,

246
00:12:35,051 --> 00:12:37,780
they're extremely good for the gorillas 
and once again,

247
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:39,190
everyone,
they want a piece of it.

248
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:40,143
Hey,

249
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,130
well that's a whole other story as well 
and now it's your turn.

250
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:49,993
Do you think it's possible to end the 
trafficking of cocaine or do you think 

251
00:12:52,671 --> 00:12:56,330
it's simply a matter that each time one 
band is dismantled and other ones simply

252
00:12:56,350 --> 00:12:57,320
appears?
