1
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:08,473
Every time,
less than American government tries to 

2
00:00:09,711 --> 00:00:10,544
discuss foreign policy and development,
they ended up discussing regional 

3
00:00:13,551 --> 00:00:14,384
integration.
That is why we should understand the 

4
00:00:16,201 --> 00:00:18,950
three main common features of Latin 
America,

5
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:21,020
football,
soccer for you Americans,

6
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:24,770
revolutions and the regional 
organizations.

7
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,690
Seriously,
we're really not kidding here.

8
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:27,524
In the last few decades,
there have been so many regional 

9
00:00:29,631 --> 00:00:30,464
organizations that it is almost 
impossible to know what goals each of 

10
00:00:33,651 --> 00:00:34,484
them have besides obviously being an 
excuse for spending money on public 

11
00:00:37,431 --> 00:00:40,970
workers headquarters and traveling.
These are unison,

12
00:00:40,971 --> 00:00:42,470
Mercosur,
Albert Caricom,

13
00:00:42,471 --> 00:00:44,940
Sanilac Ld,
the Indian community seekers,

14
00:00:44,941 --> 00:00:46,130
seller,
the Rio Group,

15
00:00:46,131 --> 00:00:48,710
and of course the Organization of 
American States,

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:49,723
and to be honest,
I'm probably not even mentioning all of 

17
00:00:52,611 --> 00:00:53,444
them there anyway.
Once you hear about all of these 

18
00:00:54,681 --> 00:00:55,514
organizations,
you might be thinking the Latin America 

19
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,630
is the place where people get on with 
each other.

20
00:00:59,631 --> 00:01:00,464
The best.
A place where it's really easy to do 

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,830
business among the different countries.

22
00:01:03,860 --> 00:01:04,693
I'm where governments work together for 
the common good in some sort of 

23
00:01:07,551 --> 00:01:09,590
wonderful paradise,
right?

24
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:12,680
When all the bad news is.
If you didn't guess that none of that is

25
00:01:12,681 --> 00:01:14,810
true.
All of these organizations,

26
00:01:14,811 --> 00:01:17,300
they were born with these really 
wonderful home ideas,

27
00:01:17,301 --> 00:01:18,134
but we could say they all really did 
nothing for developments and economic 

28
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:25,100
and political integration in Latin 
America.

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,023
New institutions are created,
but it isn't clear what to do with the 

30
00:01:28,281 --> 00:01:30,890
previous ones.
It is an endless fight forward.

31
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:35,270
Carlos mood look just by all the 
different processes of integration.

32
00:01:35,271 --> 00:01:38,780
Trade is strangely low among these 
different countries.

33
00:01:40,540 --> 00:01:41,373
Those are important.
Yet the share of exports inside the 

34
00:01:43,451 --> 00:01:44,284
region.
It hasn't changed much and it has been 

35
00:01:45,821 --> 00:01:46,654
around 20 percent,
which is much lower than in other parts 

36
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:51,430
of the world.
This is pretty strong evidence about how

37
00:01:51,431 --> 00:01:54,370
artificial and unproductive these 
organizations.

38
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,890
We'll see the details of this case 
though.

39
00:02:01,891 --> 00:02:05,970
The word disappointment or failure would
probably better describe Mercosur boss.

40
00:02:05,971 --> 00:02:06,804
I can already tell you that it is very 
possible that this lack of real 

41
00:02:08,791 --> 00:02:09,624
integration is the origin of some of the
most important problems that the region 

42
00:02:12,841 --> 00:02:17,841
is facing.
Turnell promise

43
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:23,070
in America is to view is it's a 
fantastic region.

44
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,933
It's got great natural resources,
it has significant biodiversity and its 

45
00:02:27,481 --> 00:02:31,350
climate is very unimpressive.
Many people would say that the region is

46
00:02:31,351 --> 00:02:32,900
one of the most beautiful on a,

47
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,260
the

48
00:02:39,260 --> 00:02:40,093
economically speaking,
things on not looking so great despite 

49
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:45,820
all of these magnificent resources and 
ditch great potential,

50
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:49,250
the region has been left behind in terms
of economic growth.

51
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,113
Let's compare,
for example the current Richard's 

52
00:02:51,741 --> 00:02:54,380
country in Latin America and that would 
be chilly.

53
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,960
So I think most people would agree here 
that shit.

54
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,940
He's done a pretty good job in the last 
few decades.

55
00:02:58,960 --> 00:02:59,531
Right?
Well,

56
00:02:59,531 --> 00:03:03,100
despite that apparent progress,
just have a look at this.

57
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,490
Oh No.

58
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,323
We have taken the richest country in 
Latin America and have competitive to 

59
00:03:15,641 --> 00:03:18,460
South Korea,
which is not even the richest country in

60
00:03:18,461 --> 00:03:20,400
eastern Asia.
Ben's weld.

61
00:03:20,401 --> 00:03:23,230
The difference is pretty obvious.
In the sixties,

62
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:26,560
Chile was a poor country,
but was far richer than South Korea.

63
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,473
Yeah,

64
00:03:28,820 --> 00:03:30,350
well things.
They're rather different.

65
00:03:36,510 --> 00:03:37,343
Look at Argentina,
which was once the richest country in 

66
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,240
Latin America with the exception of 
Cuba,

67
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:44,930
but now we'll take a look at its 
evolution when compared to Spain.

68
00:03:51,740 --> 00:03:53,480
Well,
one of the causes for this lower growth,

69
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:57,530
my precisely be the low trade 
integration and the access protectionism

70
00:03:57,531 --> 00:04:00,650
and bureaucracy that the region has 
always suffered from.

71
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,573
I mean there are loads of agreements,
there are tons of committees and forums 

72
00:04:04,131 --> 00:04:06,260
and all of that stuff,
but when the rubber hits the road,

73
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:07,363
it was really nothing there but do hold 
on for just one second because a few 

74
00:04:11,930 --> 00:04:12,763
years ago a new integration project it 
was put into place and this one is 

75
00:04:15,711 --> 00:04:18,680
actually completely different to the 
rest.

76
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:22,040
Not only is it the first project with 
real success in the region,

77
00:04:22,190 --> 00:04:23,023
but it might also change the destiny of 
Latin America forever and here we're 

78
00:04:27,231 --> 00:04:32,231
talking about the Pacific alliance civic
alliance,

79
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:41,300
April of 2011,
all friends,

80
00:04:41,301 --> 00:04:41,991
Chile,
Columbia,

81
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:42,824
Mexico,
Peru formed the so called Pacific 

82
00:04:44,661 --> 00:04:45,494
alliance.
It's mission is to finally achieve and 

83
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:50,210
integration,
so the goods capital and people can move

84
00:04:50,211 --> 00:04:51,044
freely around the region.
All of this was put in place with the 

85
00:04:53,631 --> 00:04:57,590
idea that it would stimulate growth 
development and competitiveness in these

86
00:04:57,591 --> 00:04:58,424
economies.

87
00:04:58,730 --> 00:04:59,563
Yes.

88
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:04,010
Teresa account for 55 percent of Latin 
American exports.

89
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,100
This is not a romantic integration,
political integration.

90
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:10,310
It is a realistic integration before the
world and to the world.

91
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,400
Alan Garcia,
former president of Peru,

92
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:15,200
man,
so they did.

93
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:18,860
Even though there's still a lot of work 
to be done since then development,

94
00:05:18,861 --> 00:05:23,861
it's been really significant.
Six years.

95
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:27,284
These four countries,
they've removed 92 percent of customs 

96
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,990
tariffs and they've set a deadline to 
remove all of the rest as well.

97
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:33,883
Along with this,
they've simplified the bureaucracy of 

98
00:05:35,301 --> 00:05:36,134
customs and administration,
especially when it comes to rules about 

99
00:05:38,721 --> 00:05:42,860
the origin of goods.
This was previously a significant burden

100
00:05:42,861 --> 00:05:43,694
on the region.

101
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:46,340
Alright.
All right,

102
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:47,173
so up until now,
if a Colombian producer used Peruvian 

103
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:50,273
supplies,
he couldn't take advantage of the free 

104
00:05:51,861 --> 00:05:56,420
trade agreements between Columbia and 
Mexico when selling his goods to Mexico,

105
00:05:56,480 --> 00:06:01,350
which just crazy.
That's not the end of it.

106
00:06:01,370 --> 00:06:03,560
Visa requirements,
they've also been eliminated,

107
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,430
so the movements of visitors has 
actually doubled and then,

108
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:08,264
and this is very important,
there have been significant advances in 

109
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,044
financial integration.
These four countries have created the m 

110
00:06:14,881 --> 00:06:17,990
I l a,
the American integrated market,

111
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:21,070
which is meant to be the largest stock 
market in Latin.

112
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:21,290
Okay.

113
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:22,123
American

114
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,150
oldest,
more among other initiatives.

115
00:06:27,151 --> 00:06:30,600
The countries in the alliance are 
working together in order to be known in

116
00:06:30,601 --> 00:06:31,434
international markets.
They have also started to share 

117
00:06:33,481 --> 00:06:34,314
embassies in African and Asian countries
and they have decided to negotiate 

118
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:39,690
altogether for their free trade 
agreements.

119
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,553
For example,
they've actually already started to do 

120
00:06:41,641 --> 00:06:43,200
this with New Zealand,
Australia,

121
00:06:43,230 --> 00:06:44,940
Canada,
and Singapore.

122
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,080
Australia and New Zealand start trade 
talks with Pacific alliance.

123
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:50,003
In other words,
these four countries are building step 

124
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:52,664
by step,
a unique market which will be rather 

125
00:06:54,871 --> 00:06:55,704
significance.
We're talking about 240 million 

126
00:06:58,171 --> 00:06:59,004
consumers with a combined GDP,
which makes this alliance one of the 

127
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:04,920
eight largest economies in the world.

128
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,850
Yeah.

129
00:07:08,380 --> 00:07:09,213
This is an economy that represents 50 
percent of all exports and more than 40 

130
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:15,940
percent of all foreign investments in 
Latin America.

131
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:16,863
We could say that if the Pacific 
alliance keeps it up in a very short 

132
00:07:19,691 --> 00:07:22,120
time,
we might have to consider it the biggest

133
00:07:22,121 --> 00:07:22,954
power in Latin America,
but in order to understand a bit better 

134
00:07:25,451 --> 00:07:27,940
the achievements that they've had in 
only six years,

135
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:28,833
we should look at the other large group 
in the region and that would be fall of 

136
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:36,583
METCO.

137
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:41,080
Okay,
so it was created in 1991 by Brazil,

138
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:42,510
Argentina,
Uruguay,

139
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,080
and Paraguay with the intention of 
creating one large integrated market.

140
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:49,030
Well,
these were ambitious goals,

141
00:07:49,031 --> 00:07:52,090
but the advances,
we've been pretty damn modest.

142
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:53,980
And how about some evidence of this?
Well,

143
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:54,873
just have a look at this.
The trade among Mercosur members 

144
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:02,100
represents today less than 30 percent of
the total trade of its members in 1995.

145
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,423
That was almost 20 percent.
Rather than encouraging trade between 

146
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:09,064
its members,
we could say that Marcus has actually 

147
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:11,974
weakened them in the last few years.
Microsoft has become some sort of 

148
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:16,144
protectionist shield rather than 
something which is working to integrate 

149
00:08:19,121 --> 00:08:19,954
these countries further.
Not exactly what they wanted in the 

150
00:08:21,941 --> 00:08:22,774
first place.

151
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:24,730
Group

152
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,440
is become little more than an antigo 
talking shop,

153
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:29,930
but why isn't this working?
Well,

154
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:32,990
that's mainly because the countries,
they're not really very committed.

155
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:33,943
In theory,
Microsoft is a process of economic 

156
00:08:36,051 --> 00:08:36,884
integration,
but there are so many exceptions and 

157
00:08:38,721 --> 00:08:40,370
restrictions.
That's in the end.

158
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:42,920
There's no free movement of goods or 
services.

159
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:46,490
Microsoft has become something which is 
totally ineffective.

160
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,840
A good example can be found on the 
border of Argentina and Uruguay.

161
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:51,763
In theory,
the goods should be able to move freely 

162
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,390
between both countries.
However,

163
00:08:55,391 --> 00:08:58,200
the reality is of the difference when 
adding customs,

164
00:08:58,201 --> 00:09:00,950
inspections and bureaucracy.
A truck from Uruguay,

165
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,530
Argentina could be delayed for more than
24 hours,

166
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,930
which is totally crazy when it's 
supposed to not be delayed at all.

167
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,690
All of this has led to Uruguay,
formally asking,

168
00:09:12,691 --> 00:09:13,524
do you become a member of the Pacific 
alliance and there is more to this 

169
00:09:16,771 --> 00:09:17,604
story.
Still the political change in Argentina 

170
00:09:18,991 --> 00:09:21,450
and Brazil has led to both of their 
governments.

171
00:09:21,451 --> 00:09:25,140
Accepting that marcus,
or at least as it is understood today,

172
00:09:25,260 --> 00:09:30,260
is almost completely worthless.
We'll never reach the common market.

173
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:31,313
The custom union is completely destroyed
and the free trade area is not working 

174
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:37,200
either.
Mercosur isn't a dying state.

175
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:40,230
Danilo is story minister of Economy in 
Uruguay.

176
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,723
This is why Macri has decided to become 
closer to the Pacific alliance and look 

177
00:09:44,911 --> 00:09:47,430
the ties between both processes of 
integration.

178
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,323
The real question becomes now will the 
Pacific alliance creates a change in 

179
00:09:51,271 --> 00:09:52,560
America,
so if it does,

180
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,200
then that would be great news for the 
entire region,

181
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,800
civic pumas.

182
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,280
Now of course,
the question that we have to ask is,

183
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:08,114
well,
why is the Pacific alliance on like any 

184
00:10:09,501 --> 00:10:10,334
of those other organizations,
the only one that seems to be working 

185
00:10:13,430 --> 00:10:16,670
well maybe this has to do with these so 
called Pacific Pumas,

186
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,630
Chile,
Peru,

187
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:19,220
Columbia,
and Mexico.

188
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,143
These countries have been the most 
dynamic economies in Latin America and 

189
00:10:23,631 --> 00:10:24,464
they share the same vision.
They all agree there's in order to grow 

190
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:27,434
and develop,
they have to produce and do business 

191
00:10:29,031 --> 00:10:29,864
with the rest of the world,
and this is why according to the welds 

192
00:10:32,301 --> 00:10:34,790
bank,
these humans are the country where it is

193
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,653
easiest to do business or were more 
trade agreements are signed with the 

194
00:10:38,361 --> 00:10:38,850
rest of the week.

195
00:10:38,850 --> 00:10:43,850
Well anyway,

196
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,510
the Pacific Alliance represents one of 
the best opportunities for Latin America

197
00:10:52,511 --> 00:10:55,600
to be in a position to become the talk 
of the town.

198
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,553
It wouldn't even be too much of a 
stretch to say that we could be 

199
00:10:58,211 --> 00:11:00,640
witnessing the birth of a great economic
power,

200
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:04,000
but now it's your turn.
Do you think Latin America has to bet on

201
00:11:04,001 --> 00:11:05,870
these processes of integration?
Well,

202
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:08,860
leave us your opinion in the comments 
below as well as in this quick.
