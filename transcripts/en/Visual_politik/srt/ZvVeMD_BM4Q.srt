1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,093
Forty five years,
it's been 45 years since China and 

2
00:00:11,951 --> 00:00:14,980
Australia established diplomatic 
relations.

3
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:17,470
Since then,
things have changed a lot.

4
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:26,790
Shawna was founded in 1949 with this,
with these words,

5
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,200
John Wall run man's punchy life that 
Chinese people have stood up.

6
00:00:32,650 --> 00:00:33,483
It was an assertion of sovereignty.
It was an assertion of pride and we 

7
00:00:37,961 --> 00:00:41,500
stand up and so we say hourly.
I run Manzanar,

8
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:43,630
Eli,
the Australian people stand up

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,030
through

10
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,863
all these years.
Both countries have maintained one of 

11
00:00:51,331 --> 00:00:52,164
the most fruitful,
controversial and interesting 

12
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:54,744
relationships in the world are 
relationship based on stories about 

13
00:00:57,481 --> 00:00:58,450
money,
spies,

14
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,180
accusations,
infidelities,

15
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:01,073
and many,
many conflicting interests because in 

16
00:01:03,991 --> 00:01:04,824
all honesty,
if we're talking about a relationship 

17
00:01:06,331 --> 00:01:08,610
between two people instead of two 
countries,

18
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,640
we have a great script for an Alaskan 
American Tele Novella.

19
00:01:16,370 --> 00:01:18,560
Obviously this swell,
this is visual politics,

20
00:01:18,561 --> 00:01:20,740
so let's get right to the point,
shall we.

21
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,883
Today,

22
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:26,970
China is Australia's main commercial 
partner.

23
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,420
That purchases represents about a third 
of all Australian exports,

24
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:33,600
eight times more than exports to the 
United States.

25
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:34,823
In 2015,
China and Australia signed a free trade 

26
00:01:37,021 --> 00:01:37,854
agreements and today their trade 
relations exceed a hundred and 

27
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:43,200
$55,000,000,000
per year,

28
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:51,773
and not only that,
China is also becoming an incredibly 

29
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:54,984
important investor in Australia.
I couldn't freak where one in 20 people 

30
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,124
or Chinese among them,
many millionaires who decided to find a 

31
00:02:01,651 --> 00:02:05,820
safer place with more guarantees for 
their assets and their lives,

32
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,193
such as the scale of trade that 
financial markets have long been of the 

33
00:02:09,301 --> 00:02:10,134
view that the Australian dollar is one 
of the best proxies for bets on China 

34
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:14,850
itself.
James Laurenson,

35
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,790
deputy director of the Australia China 
relations institute.

36
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,810
Of course,
this all has its consequences.

37
00:02:23,811 --> 00:02:25,850
We already talked about it here on 
visual politic.

38
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:30,880
Australia has broken records and does 
not have a national crisis for almost 30

39
00:02:31,071 --> 00:02:32,750
years.
Sounds pretty amazing.

40
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:33,783
Rise.
One of the great Chinese takeoff had a 

41
00:02:34,671 --> 00:02:36,260
lot to do with all of this success.

42
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,730
Therefore,

43
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:38,563
it's easy to understand why when the 
lowery institute's and important thing 

44
00:02:41,031 --> 00:02:43,580
tank in the country asked Australians 
last year,

45
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:46,280
which relationship was more important to
them?

46
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:49,850
The one with the United States or the 
one with China and the result,

47
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,753
but it was a tie.
This is despite the fact that relations 

48
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:55,550
within North American friends very close
indeed.

49
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,220
However,
in spite of this romance,

50
00:02:58,221 --> 00:03:03,221
the fact is for thousand and 17 was not 
a year of love for Australia and China.

51
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:05,563
Check out what Bob Carr,
former minister for foreign affairs of 

52
00:03:08,141 --> 00:03:08,974
Australia set on the subject this year.
Australia declared rhetorical war on 

53
00:03:12,521 --> 00:03:13,354
China.
The words being used by Australian 

54
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,184
leaders are the harshest anytime since 
diplomatic relations commenced in 1972 

55
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,180
with the exception of comments at the 
time of the Tiananmen crackdown.

56
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:24,950
The Tony's harsher than that of any 
other US ally,

57
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,890
including Japan.
As you can see,

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:31,920
2017 was a very difficult year for both 
countries relations.

59
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,870
So much so that a survey by the global 
times,

60
00:03:34,871 --> 00:03:37,950
one of China's most popular newspapers 
examines the Australia,

61
00:03:37,970 --> 00:03:41,440
was the most hostile country to China in
2017.

62
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:43,540
And the truth is that with trump in the 
White House,

63
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:44,403
those are really big words because we 
can't continue to allow China to rape 

64
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,940
our country.
And that's what they're doing.

65
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,360
It's the greatest theft in the history 
of the world.

66
00:03:55,420 --> 00:03:56,253
So what the hell has happened?
What has led to so much dissension 

67
00:03:58,271 --> 00:04:00,640
between Canberra and Beijing?
Well,

68
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,481
that A.
Look at that,

69
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,314
shall we?

70
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,770
The storm.
Oh,

71
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:14,070
first 2017,
seems like it'd be a good year for China

72
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:14,933
and Australia.
Economic relations wouldn't stop 

73
00:04:16,411 --> 00:04:18,480
growing.
Trump's shedding off his best diplomatic

74
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:20,820
skills hung up on the Australian prime 
minister,

75
00:04:20,821 --> 00:04:21,654
Malcolm Turnbull himself further sinking
his popularity in this area of the 

76
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:27,380
world.
We had a good telephone call,

77
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,383
a very cool,
and the Australian government's even 

78
00:04:30,211 --> 00:04:31,044
publicly supported China,
replacing the United States as a main 

79
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,250
member of the fails TPP,
the Pacific free trade agreements.

80
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,800
We could almost say those in telanovela 
terms.

81
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:45,920
Love was about to triumph.
However,

82
00:04:48,461 --> 00:04:49,294
the good times didn't last long and 
everything started to go wrong about 

83
00:04:52,361 --> 00:04:55,240
halfway through the year and it went 
really wrong.

84
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,400
Yes,
they have had clashes before,

85
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:59,740
but nothing really major in recent 
years.

86
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:00,603
The Australian government has followed a
strategy that basically it consisted of 

87
00:05:04,121 --> 00:05:07,630
trying to balance that position between 
Beijing and Washington.

88
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,013
To

89
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:14,083
don't make matters,
it was all Beijing and insecurity and 

90
00:05:16,101 --> 00:05:17,930
defense matters.
It was a Washington.

91
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,853
We already mentioned on visual politic 
that Republicans consider Australia to 

92
00:05:21,861 --> 00:05:22,694
be the US is best ally and so should be.
Australia is the only country that has 

93
00:05:28,491 --> 00:05:29,324
intervened in every major us walk and 
for years the military relations have 

94
00:05:33,171 --> 00:05:34,004
been so tight that Australia has become 
for us as spearhead in this area of the 

95
00:05:37,881 --> 00:05:38,200
world.

96
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,033
Awesome.

97
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:41,413
The Australian prime minister himself is
trimmed as great appreciation for the 

98
00:05:44,540 --> 00:05:45,373
United States saying the peace and 
stability of a region has been enabled 

99
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:48,914
by consistent us global leadership.
While that leadership would not have 

100
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,620
been possible without the hard power of 
fleets and armies,

101
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:57,770
its greatest potency has come from the 
values we embodies.

102
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:59,630
Through all the twists and turns of 
history,

103
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:02,420
the United States has stood for the 
values on which it's great.

104
00:06:02,421 --> 00:06:04,070
Republic was founded,
freedom,

105
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:05,840
democracy,
and the rule of law.

106
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,370
Malcolm Turnbull.
Let's get back to the Chinese matter.

107
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:10,243
See,
these words were pronounced on June the 

108
00:06:12,021 --> 00:06:12,854
second 2017.
That was the first time in Australian 

109
00:06:15,051 --> 00:06:15,884
prime.
Minister spoke so clearly in favor of 

110
00:06:17,061 --> 00:06:20,240
Washington in a speech which was also 
full of warnings to China.

111
00:06:20,290 --> 00:06:21,123
Such a dark view of our future would see
China isolating those who stand in 

112
00:06:24,801 --> 00:06:27,920
opposition to or are not aligned with 
its interests.

113
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:31,580
And then just eight days later the media
storm broke out.

114
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:36,410
It says espionage and foreign 
interference against Australian interest

115
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:39,830
is extensive.
Several news organizations reported on a

116
00:06:39,831 --> 00:06:40,664
single story.
The Australian intelligence agency was 

117
00:06:42,771 --> 00:06:43,604
making very serious warnings about the 
Chinese government's intentions to 

118
00:06:46,641 --> 00:06:49,400
influence Australian politics through 
various means,

119
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,860
including purchasing politicians,
journalists,

120
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:52,694
and scientists.
All these surveillance and intimidation 

121
00:06:54,381 --> 00:06:57,890
of citizens belonging to the Chinese 
community in Australia.

122
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:01,940
The scans it was unleashed suddenly 
knew,

123
00:07:01,941 --> 00:07:02,774
started to emerge on the collaboration 
Australian universities and scientists 

124
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,960
with Chinese military contractors for 
former politicians.

125
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:11,540
It's not chance the former Trade 
Minister Andrew Rob,

126
00:07:11,541 --> 00:07:12,374
who now works for companies controlled 
by the Chinese government in exchange 

127
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:15,914
for juicy salaries,
but amount to hundreds of thousands of 

128
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:18,980
dollars.

129
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,813
Yes,

130
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,040
of course.
The Australian security services,

131
00:07:23,041 --> 00:07:25,710
fear of Chinese espionage certainly 
isn't new.

132
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:26,573
Various Australian governments have been
blocking Chinese corporate operations 

133
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:30,323
for years,
and so I've also banned companies such 

134
00:07:32,101 --> 00:07:36,060
as quite way from participating in 
deploying a national broadband network.

135
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:36,923
This is all precisely because of a fear 
of espionage or excessive Chinese 

136
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:41,400
influence.
However,

137
00:07:41,401 --> 00:07:42,234
despite everything,
controversy and tension had never gone 

138
00:07:44,551 --> 00:07:45,384
this far,
but reports have suggested that the 

139
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,313
Chinese Communist Party has been working
to covertly interfere with our media or 

140
00:07:51,211 --> 00:07:52,044
universities and even the decisions.
Elected representatives right here in 

141
00:07:55,111 --> 00:07:56,940
this building in the parliament.
Malcolm,

142
00:08:00,970 --> 00:08:02,860
on December the twelfth,
2017,

143
00:08:02,861 --> 00:08:03,694
Sam Dastyari,
Labor Party senator and one of the most 

144
00:08:05,561 --> 00:08:06,394
promising political figures in the 
country was forced to resign because of 

145
00:08:08,951 --> 00:08:10,060
his ties to China.

146
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:13,390
I said earlier in the statement that I 
am a patriotic Australian.

147
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:14,943
I meant that with all my heart and I 
leave the Senate with nothing but good 

148
00:08:19,481 --> 00:08:22,930
thoughts for our country and for our 
people.

149
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:24,033
Among other things,
he was accused of receiving money in 

150
00:08:25,511 --> 00:08:26,344
exchange for speeches that favored the 
Chinese government's interests and even 

151
00:08:29,231 --> 00:08:30,064
have alerting a Chinese businessman 
linked to the communist party that he 

152
00:08:32,351 --> 00:08:33,184
could be being investigated by 
Australia's intelligence agencies and 

153
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:36,754
that his phone could be tapped well.
Scientists collaborating with Chinese 

154
00:08:40,991 --> 00:08:43,630
military contractors,
university in filtration,

155
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,850
paying journalists,
buying politicians.

156
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:49,090
These accusations had been running since
the beginning of June.

157
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,283
The Australian government announced it 
publicly and began modifying its 

158
00:08:54,011 --> 00:08:56,070
legislation on espionage,
treason,

159
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,083
immigration,
and on financing political parties and 

160
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,333
this dvr.
It looks like it's only just the 

161
00:09:02,251 --> 00:09:03,084
beginning.
It is no secret that China is very 

162
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:10,200
active in intelligence activities 
directed against us.

163
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,440
The consequences of these cooling 
political relations can be seen.

164
00:09:13,470 --> 00:09:15,210
For example,
in foreign policy,

165
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,103
we can clearly say that in 2017,
Australia has been favoring the United 

166
00:09:20,430 --> 00:09:21,263
States like never before,
but don't think that this position has 

167
00:09:23,071 --> 00:09:26,070
been unanimous among the political class
or at all.

168
00:09:26,071 --> 00:09:26,904
In fact,
the government doesn't seem to 

169
00:09:28,261 --> 00:09:29,094
understand the economic importance of 
the relationship with China or the 

170
00:09:31,441 --> 00:09:32,274
strategic issues involved.
We're putting all of our faith and our 

171
00:09:34,651 --> 00:09:37,970
relationship with China through the 
foreign policy lens of the US,

172
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,590
Paul Keating,
Australian former prime minister,

173
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:43,200
and you know what,
given the circumstances,

174
00:09:43,201 --> 00:09:47,340
I think that this entire database on the
position Australia should take regarding

175
00:09:47,341 --> 00:09:48,950
China is quite understanding.

176
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:54,543
On the one hand,
many critics affirmed that there isn't 

177
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,093
enough evidence of the Chinese 
interference that the government 

178
00:09:59,351 --> 00:10:00,184
denounces some even say that this is all
a political operation fed by Washington 

179
00:10:04,630 --> 00:10:08,650
now on the other is breaking with China 
or at least being this forceful with the

180
00:10:08,651 --> 00:10:11,680
Beijing government isn't exactly easy 
for Australia,

181
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:12,790
and now you might be asking,
well,

182
00:10:12,791 --> 00:10:14,050
why is this?
Well,

183
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:19,080
check this out.
China defends itself.

184
00:10:25,230 --> 00:10:27,180
Israel,
this entire political crisis.

185
00:10:27,181 --> 00:10:28,014
China has been very strong.
Of course they have denied all 

186
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:31,914
accusations and have even said that this
entire campaign is based on racial 

187
00:10:35,371 --> 00:10:39,600
prejudice and anti Chinese paranoia.
This paranoia they've claimed is turning

188
00:10:39,601 --> 00:10:43,980
into clear hostility towards the Chinese
community in Australia itself.

189
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,623
Chinese diplomats warn students in 
Australia to stay alert to safety risks 

190
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:50,460
after spate of attacks.
Yes,

191
00:10:50,461 --> 00:10:52,560
these types of messages may seem 
exaggerated,

192
00:10:52,561 --> 00:10:53,394
especially because the truth is that 
beyond a few posters in one university 

193
00:10:56,071 --> 00:10:56,904
or another,
there seems to be no evidence of this 

194
00:10:59,041 --> 00:10:59,874
acclaimed danger,
but although this claim shows us how 

195
00:11:02,071 --> 00:11:02,904
things off,
it's also kind of a warning because 

196
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:09,620
clearly it isn't good publicity.
Allow me to explain myself.

197
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,920
Yet,
Chinese students account for four out of

198
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:15,813
every 10 foreign students in Australian 
universities and they spend 

199
00:11:18,740 --> 00:11:22,750
$18,000,000,000
in the country every single year.

200
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:23,613
It seems that Xi Jinping's governments 
wants to make it very clear that it is 

201
00:11:26,201 --> 00:11:27,310
willing,
if necessary,

202
00:11:27,370 --> 00:11:30,010
to play in economic terms as a pressure 
measure.

203
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:32,883
This is something that by the way,
they have used recently with both South 

204
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:36,963
Korea and Taiwan

205
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,390
and

206
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:44,120
we are only talking about students here,
but also about tourists and investors.

207
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,480
For example,
in recent years,

208
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:46,314
the luxury sector has experienced a huge
economic boom in Australia and you know 

209
00:11:49,891 --> 00:11:50,790
why?
Well,

210
00:11:50,791 --> 00:11:52,770
listen to this,
students,

211
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:53,673
tourists and Chinese residents in 
Australia are responsible for up to two 

212
00:11:56,441 --> 00:11:57,274
thirds of all luxury retail sales in 
Sydney and Melbourne and had as another 

213
00:12:00,671 --> 00:12:01,504
example.
China's direct investments in Australia 

214
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:08,080
of multiplies not by 10 by 20,
but by 32 inches,

215
00:12:08,081 --> 00:12:10,270
nine years,
so as you can see,

216
00:12:10,271 --> 00:12:11,104
slowing down this entire process could 
translate into a lot and that is a lot 

217
00:12:15,491 --> 00:12:19,570
of pain for the Australian economy,
but dear viewer,

218
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,920
that is simply the way things are.
So far,

219
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:23,833
the Australian government remains 
faithful to its close relationship with 

220
00:12:26,201 --> 00:12:27,034
Washington.
The United States seems to have secured 

221
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:29,553
an alliance that is essential for their 
interests in this area of the world and 

222
00:12:32,590 --> 00:12:34,480
for that military industry.
In recent years,

223
00:12:34,481 --> 00:12:37,360
Australia became one of the U.
s is best customers,

224
00:12:37,390 --> 00:12:38,223
and in the next decade they expect to 
spend more than a hundred billion 

225
00:12:40,931 --> 00:12:41,764
dollars.
Renewing their armed forces were 

226
00:12:43,241 --> 00:12:46,030
American contractors have a big 
advantage.

227
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:50,263
However,
there all more than a few people then 

228
00:12:51,381 --> 00:12:53,150
it's by people here.
I need politicians,

229
00:12:53,151 --> 00:12:53,984
businessmen,
and citizens to Australia to remain 

230
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,104
neutral and protect its national 
security without having to make so many 

231
00:13:00,590 --> 00:13:03,170
public accusations.
So now the question becomes,

232
00:13:03,171 --> 00:13:05,180
well,
how is this story going to end?

233
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,073
Well,
one of the most fruitful relationships 

234
00:13:07,341 --> 00:13:09,350
in recent years be at risk.
Well,

235
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,050
when the time is going to tell,
but now it's your turn.

236
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,540
Where do you think Australian politics 
should turn?

237
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:15,433
Do leave us your answer in the comments

They provided the vocals in this

244
00:13:32,031 --> 00:13:34,780
but we're not mine and as always,
thank you for.

245
00:13:35,780 --> 00:13:38,660
And so we say at our yard run Manzano,
Eli,

246
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:39,523
the Australian people stand up.
It is no secret that China is very 

247
00:13:43,461 --> 00:13:47,630
active in intelligence activities 
directed against us.
