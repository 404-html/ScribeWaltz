1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,030
Hell is the question.
What would you say is a drug?

2
00:00:12,031 --> 00:00:14,070
Traffic has biggest dream,

00:00:14,470 --> 00:00:15,720

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:22,983
All right.
Allow me to explain myself because we 

11
00:00:24,281 --> 00:00:25,114
all have dreams.
You mean politicians and of course drug 

12
00:00:27,731 --> 00:00:29,860
traffickers,
they are no exception.

13
00:00:29,861 --> 00:00:32,820
They are people too.
There may be hard to believe in law,

14
00:00:32,821 --> 00:00:33,654
sort of the ruthless and cruel drug 
trafficking in industry because there 

15
00:00:36,641 --> 00:00:40,930
are human beings with names.
And in this case also nicknamed zoo.

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,793
Just like everyone else have dreams.
So let's get back to my original 

17
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:45,544
question.
What is the biggest dream that a drug 

18
00:00:47,801 --> 00:00:49,120
trafficker could have?
I mean,

19
00:00:49,210 --> 00:00:50,043
of course they might be different 
possible answers and it cause we're all 

20
00:00:51,821 --> 00:00:52,654
individuals.
But unfortunately history tells us that 

21
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:56,680
if most drug traffickers good,
make a wish,

22
00:00:56,681 --> 00:00:57,514
just one single wish,
it would be to turn the country into a 

23
00:01:00,521 --> 00:01:03,490
narco state.
That is to say they would turn them into

24
00:01:03,491 --> 00:01:06,220
states,
run by a kind of criminal corporation,

25
00:01:06,221 --> 00:01:08,200
meetup of politicians,
public officials,

26
00:01:08,201 --> 00:01:09,880
judges,
the police and the military,

27
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,743
which in one way or another we're 
associated with drugs way drug traffic 

28
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:16,480
is good.
Basically Act with impunity.

29
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:19,960
Exporting and distributing narcotics is 
without any restrictions.

30
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,010
Very recently here on visual politic,
we spoke about how the bolivarian regime

31
00:01:24,011 --> 00:01:24,844
of Nicolas Maduro dl start Okabe Oh and 
the cartel de los [inaudible] was 

32
00:01:27,941 --> 00:01:30,430
turning Venezuela into a narco state.
However,

33
00:01:30,431 --> 00:01:31,264
in Latin America,
a politics that goes far beyond 

34
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,810
Venezuela.
In this video,

35
00:01:34,811 --> 00:01:35,644
we're going to find out it's a bit more 
about one character who was able to 

36
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,980
promote the alliance between the 
narcotics industry and politicians,

37
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:42,843
so listen up

38
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:44,120
[inaudible].

39
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:53,100
Okay.

40
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,360
Narco populism.

41
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,813
We,

42
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:57,853
no,
it's the narcotics industry is one of 

43
00:01:59,081 --> 00:01:59,914
the most important illegal businesses 
every year and moved several hundred 

44
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:06,190
billion dollars.
Now allow me to ask another question.

45
00:02:06,191 --> 00:02:09,760
Do you think that are cartel can survive
without political support?

46
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:13,330
Can they survive without controlling the
institutions in some way?

47
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:14,223
To answer this question.
Let's go back to the beginning and take 

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,560
a look at how the most important drug 
dealers of all time managed to do it.

49
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:22,840
It's because even though it's true that 
in the beginning,

50
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:26,170
drug traffickers started out as little 
more than a band of outlaws.

51
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:31,060
The time came when this all changed.
A time came and so did it.

52
00:02:31,061 --> 00:02:31,894
Protagonists,
Blue Escobar Gaviria considered by 

53
00:02:37,431 --> 00:02:42,110
Forbes magazine to be one of the richest
men of his time on the entire planet.

54
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,033
According to Forbes in 1987 Pablo 
Escobar had a fortune that exceeded $2 

55
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:48,463
billion and Escobar,
he radically changed the global drug 

56
00:02:50,391 --> 00:02:50,730
industry.

57
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:51,563
Great.

58
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,253
See on the one hand,
so you created an entire network of 

59
00:02:56,191 --> 00:03:00,640
criminal holding company that included 
businesses like kidnapping,

60
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:01,593
murder,
and of course their main activity of 

61
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:04,204
drug trafficking.
All of these activities were perfectly 

62
00:03:06,221 --> 00:03:09,160
integrated into a structure.
The metagene cartel,

63
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:13,570
which has a clear organizational chart,
a well defined hierarchy,

64
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,600
and even a zone based distribution 
network,

65
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:17,463
each with its own managers talking in 
business speak these words sort of like 

66
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:21,454
franchises or branches.
On the other hand is regarding his main 

67
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:26,070
business drugs.
This cartel,

68
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:26,913
the Mexican cartel,
achieved an almost complete vertical 

69
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,424
integration.
That is the cartel took over the 

70
00:03:31,991 --> 00:03:33,220
harvest,
the production,

71
00:03:33,221 --> 00:03:34,054
the distribution,
and the marketing of the vast majority 

72
00:03:35,951 --> 00:03:36,784
of its merchandise.
They did everything and they took over 

73
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:40,023
every single stage of the business.
That's how the Medellin cartel and 

74
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,910
managed to bring in more than $7 billion
per year.

75
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:51,803
Of course,
none of this would've been possible 

76
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,990
without the complicity of the public 
authority.

77
00:03:54,991 --> 00:03:55,824
Yeah.

78
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,053
Lee Escobar reached the top of the 
cocaine cartel by astutely reinvesting 

79
00:04:00,811 --> 00:04:04,620
his initial earnings and becoming a PR 
master in Colombia.

80
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:08,550
With his growing wealth.
Escobar bought a newspaper in Midian,

81
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,443
gained influence in Colombian politics 
and he successfully ran for public 

82
00:04:12,691 --> 00:04:16,080
office becoming an alternative to the 
national congress.

83
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:19,410
David Henry Forbes magazine,
1987

84
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,110
you see,
for many years,

85
00:04:27,111 --> 00:04:30,620
Pablo Escobar had impunity with his 
money and threads.

86
00:04:30,621 --> 00:04:32,890
The well known phrase of Silver 
[inaudible].

87
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,780
He managed to infiltrate the Colombian 
state.

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,610
He bribes the military,
politicians,

89
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:38,444
governors,
and the police in such a way that many 

90
00:04:40,221 --> 00:04:41,054
Colombian institutions were under his 
command for a long time and that's not 

91
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,374
all.
Pablo Escobar also financed electoral 

92
00:04:46,881 --> 00:04:47,714
campaigns to win popular support.
And what does a politician do when he 

93
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:52,580
wants to gain popularity fast?
Well,

94
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:53,443
he promoted projects like the building 
of houses for the nation's poorest 

95
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,780
citizens as well as distributing 
provisions and creating soccer field.

96
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,350
It's pretty good,
doesn't it?

97
00:05:03,380 --> 00:05:06,470
I mean at first glance,
kind of like a Colombian Robin Hood,

98
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,113
too bad.
The truth was rather defer while he was 

99
00:05:12,441 --> 00:05:13,274
carrying out this type of campaign.
He had no qualms about flooding the 

100
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:19,520
streets with violence and blood.
Welcome to knock a popular,

101
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,573
as you will probably know,
Pablo Escobar managed to hold a seat in 

102
00:05:24,681 --> 00:05:27,410
the Colombian parliaments in 1982 until 
then,

103
00:05:27,411 --> 00:05:30,470
thanks to his political influence and 
his pr strategies,

104
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:34,040
he was able to build his embar and is 
huge fortune with the

105
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:35,033
osmosis impunity.
A member of the United States Drug 

106
00:05:38,191 --> 00:05:39,024
Enforcement Agency once said that 
importing exotic animals for his zoo 

107
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:45,900
caused escobar more problems with the 
government.

108
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,910
That is drug business.
David Henry

109
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:48,731
now,
oh,

110
00:05:48,731 --> 00:05:49,564
hold on just a second.
Don't think the Pablo Escobar's 

111
00:05:51,511 --> 00:05:52,344
political relations,
what limited to Colombia at all after 

112
00:05:55,291 --> 00:05:56,910
being elected as a deputy,
the,

113
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,423
it became untenable,
but some members of the media began 

114
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:04,060
telling the truth behind his fortune.
The DEA is pressure multiplied.

115
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:05,203
A lot of Colombian society understood 
the huge danger that's Pablo Escobar 

116
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:09,563
posed and other cartels,
they began to fear the power that the 

117
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,093
median cartel would grow into.
That's when the government began to 

118
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,244
persecute this capo,
which in a way declared war on the 

119
00:06:18,531 --> 00:06:21,290
Colombian state itself and just to be 
safe.

120
00:06:21,291 --> 00:06:24,290
The first thing Escobar did was leave 
the country less.

121
00:06:24,291 --> 00:06:25,310
Td hunted down

122
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:34,820
the lead,
sorry,

123
00:06:36,270 --> 00:06:39,420
Pablo Escobar put some space between 
himself and Columbia.

124
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:42,330
The question is,
where could he find refuge?

125
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:46,050
Would his drug money be enough to 
strengthen his alliances?

126
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,330
Well,
it seems absolutely so.

127
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:52,400
First of all,
there was panel at that time,

128
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:53,234
the military dictator manual,
Antonio Noreaga offered asylum 

129
00:06:55,911 --> 00:06:58,910
protection and to root to transport his 
merchandise.

130
00:06:58,940 --> 00:07:03,940
So imagine this industry was so powerful
that even dictators were willing to sell

131
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:05,354
their services.
The fact is that as you can see in her 

132
00:07:08,031 --> 00:07:10,730
ego,
also turns Panama into a narco state.

133
00:07:10,760 --> 00:07:11,593
That is until 1989 when a lightening 
invasion by the United States removed 

134
00:07:14,871 --> 00:07:16,460
him from power.
He was detained,

135
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:17,353
taken to the United States,
and given 30 years in prison for his 

136
00:07:19,581 --> 00:07:22,400
drug trafficking and his relationship 
with a median cartel.

137
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,283
This,
this is not the end of Palu Escobar's 

138
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:28,563
external alliances.
The truth is that he didn't feel very 

139
00:07:31,151 --> 00:07:32,890
safe and Panama either.
I mean,

140
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,230
yes,
the dictator of the country was his pal,

141
00:07:35,231 --> 00:07:38,230
but the CIA had a very large presence in
the country.

142
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:42,370
So when he needs to expected it to,
Nuria could be attempted to sell him out

143
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:46,290
because of course it was one thing to do
business with a Panamanian dictator.

144
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,910
It's quite another to and trust him with
his protection.

145
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:52,660
He needed to find a new destination.
So through the left wing,

146
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:53,494
Colombian guerrilla movements am 19 
Pablo Escobar contacted the Nicaraguan 

147
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:57,660
government.

148
00:07:57,660 --> 00:07:58,493
Don't remember

149
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:04,100
the Sandinista government board led by 
the country's current president.

150
00:08:04,101 --> 00:08:04,934
Daniel Ortega was willing to welcome 
them with open arms in exchange for a 

151
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,170
commission,
you know,

152
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:12,560
for services rendered.
The agreement specified that in addition

153
00:08:12,561 --> 00:08:14,450
to settling in the country with his 
family,

154
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:15,284
if Pablo could use some of Nicaragua,
was regions as a drug distribution 

155
00:08:18,621 --> 00:08:21,050
platform,
the problem or take her in his friends,

156
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:23,170
they were very greedy.
So a few months later,

157
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:27,470
Pavlo decided to return to Columbia,
but of course he maintained his business

158
00:08:27,471 --> 00:08:32,410
relations.
This mole along with Nicaragua,

159
00:08:32,411 --> 00:08:33,244
the m 19 gorillas also facilitated the 
median cartels contacts with the Cuban 

160
00:08:36,491 --> 00:08:37,324
governor.

161
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:39,830
Yup,
that's

162
00:08:39,830 --> 00:08:40,663
right.
Cuba was also a trading platform for 

163
00:08:42,111 --> 00:08:44,150
Pablo Escobar's businesses.
In fact,

164
00:08:44,180 --> 00:08:45,013
it is known that Pablo Escobar 
maintained good relations with the 

165
00:08:47,121 --> 00:08:49,070
Castro brothers,
although truthfully,

166
00:08:49,071 --> 00:08:49,904
it seems that he wasn't the only one.
All evidence indicates that after 

167
00:08:52,491 --> 00:08:53,324
Escobar rather drug dealers continue to 
use during the Castro is to introduce 

168
00:08:56,791 --> 00:08:59,670
all types of narcotics into the United 
States anyway,

169
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:00,640
Colombia,
Panama,

170
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:01,890
and Nicaragua.
Cuba.

171
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,843
As you can see,
a political power was one of the main 

172
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,770
drivers of the huge presence of drug 
trafficking and Latin America.

173
00:09:07,830 --> 00:09:09,780
The lack of transparency,
the corruption,

174
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:10,643
lack of counterweights and weak 
institutions where a perfect breeding 

175
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:13,944
grounds for what over the years became 
one of the great and nightmares of this 

176
00:09:16,531 --> 00:09:17,790
region.
And yes,

177
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:19,320
some of you might now be thinking,
well,

178
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,180
all right Simon,
but in the end,

179
00:09:21,181 --> 00:09:22,920
Pablo Escobar,
he fell from power.

180
00:09:23,490 --> 00:09:24,330
Yeah,
it's true,

181
00:09:24,331 --> 00:09:25,164
but when a man like Escobar falls,
it doesn't mean that the industry falls 

182
00:09:28,231 --> 00:09:30,540
and can order their relations with 
political power.

183
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:31,730
Let's have a look at Mexico.

184
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,150
The relay,

185
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:41,953
the main Mexican cartel with which Pablo
Escobar had a relationship was the 

186
00:09:44,541 --> 00:09:47,420
Guadalajara cartel led by Anesto Fon,
second,

187
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,313
Rafael Caro,
Quintero and Niguel and hell Felix 

188
00:09:51,470 --> 00:09:52,303
Guyardo.
This cartel had full impunity for two 

189
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,363
decades.
All thanks to their relations with 

190
00:09:56,601 --> 00:09:58,070
people in power.
See Felix,

191
00:09:58,071 --> 00:09:58,904
Guy Otto was in charge of public 
relations and thanks to his ability to 

192
00:10:01,701 --> 00:10:03,530
move within the highest political 
spheres.

193
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:07,310
This cartel had all the stability it 
needed to develop and grow.

194
00:10:07,370 --> 00:10:09,410
Pr Is really important.

195
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:18,290
We're talking about a criminal industry 
and in criminal organizations,

196
00:10:18,291 --> 00:10:21,440
stability is very hard to achieve.
In this case,

197
00:10:21,441 --> 00:10:24,410
the assaults on the dea agents on reggae
arena,

198
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:25,273
which ends it,
his life made Washington demands the 

199
00:10:26,661 --> 00:10:30,050
dismantling of this cartel and it's neat
as fell one by one,

200
00:10:30,110 --> 00:10:30,943
but this didn't end the business from 
prison in 1989 Phoenix Guyardo tried to 

201
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:35,864
reorganize the territories,
but in the absence of an agreement with 

202
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,004
the cartel,
it's listened to the tijuana cartel led 

203
00:10:40,941 --> 00:10:41,774
by the Ra on her brothers and the 
Sinaloa cartel led by Hector Louis 

204
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,513
Palmar Salazar,
[inaudible] Palmer and Hakim Guzman 

205
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:48,961
Maria.
Okay,

206
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:49,794
I'll chapo.
They both debuted on the Forbes list in 

207
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:55,030
2009 with an estimated 14 of more than 
$1 billion.

208
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:57,803
Okay.

209
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,920
The fact is that under El Chapo has come
on,

210
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,900
the scene or lower cartel became the 
most important and influential cartel in

211
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:07,950
Mexico and one of the most important 
criminal organizations in the world.

212
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,250
The question that many of you might be 
asking now is how did he do it?

213
00:11:11,251 --> 00:11:15,060
How can one cartel grow so much more 
than its adversaries?

214
00:11:15,090 --> 00:11:17,610
What above all,
it's because of political influences.

215
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,473
For example,
how do you prevent the federal police 

216
00:11:19,771 --> 00:11:23,010
from cashing you and nine your business?
Well,

217
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:25,770
you would do that by finding out a,
when those raids are going to happen,

218
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,633
everything is based on good relations 
and that's precisely what El Chapo made 

219
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:33,360
sure that he would have inflammation and
friends,

220
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,940
uh,
power as we've seen in other cases.

221
00:11:35,941 --> 00:11:39,420
I'll chappy's capture it.
Didn't really change the panorama today.

222
00:11:39,421 --> 00:11:43,020
This isn't a lower cartel is controlled 
by Ismael l mayors and Bardo,

223
00:11:43,021 --> 00:11:43,854
who over the years has been known to buy
officials from the special prosecutor's 

224
00:11:46,711 --> 00:11:48,510
office,
the Attorney General's office,

225
00:11:48,511 --> 00:11:52,110
and even the Counter Narcotics 
Intelligence Center and elite army corps

226
00:11:52,111 --> 00:11:57,100
creators to fight narcotics.
Obviously they don't do these businesses

227
00:11:57,101 --> 00:11:58,450
alone.
In many cases,

228
00:11:58,451 --> 00:11:59,284
they have the approval or participation 
of the authorities Fj our researcher at 

229
00:12:03,551 --> 00:12:04,384
the University of Guadalajara,
this is all done in complicity with 

230
00:12:07,631 --> 00:12:09,070
senior government official

231
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:13,300
only that explains these criminal 
groups,

232
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,400
power,
strength and resilience.

233
00:12:15,430 --> 00:12:16,263
We're talking about it,
but let's go power with which in many 

234
00:12:17,681 --> 00:12:21,070
cases norcos create a symbiosis that is 
hard to distinguish.

235
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:21,933
That's what's happening in Venezuela 
with a soulless cartel of which we've 

236
00:12:24,371 --> 00:12:25,204
already spoken here on visual politic 
and watch out because it's estimated 

237
00:12:27,551 --> 00:12:31,990
that the Mexican and Venezuelan cartels 
control 70% of all drugs and tend to the

238
00:12:31,991 --> 00:12:32,824
United States.

239
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:37,450
That's what happens in countries like 
Guatemala where some sources,

240
00:12:37,451 --> 00:12:38,284
states and the time to 80% of all the 
white powder could be mediated by 

241
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:43,330
members of the national army itself.
Oh,

242
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:44,164
what's happening in Honduras where even 
the son of former presidents Porfirio 

243
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,543
Lobo has been condemned in the United 
States for drug trafficking activities 

244
00:12:51,281 --> 00:12:53,620
while his own father was president of 
the republic.

245
00:12:53,650 --> 00:12:54,341
Anyway,
folks,

246
00:12:54,341 --> 00:12:57,010
that is the result of having weak 
institutions,

247
00:12:57,011 --> 00:13:00,250
a lack of transparency and the lack of 
counterweights in future videos.

248
00:13:00,251 --> 00:13:01,810
We're going to talk more about this 
issue,

249
00:13:01,811 --> 00:13:04,750
which is becoming very expensive class 
in American countries.

250
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,613
With this video,
we just wanted to show you a few 

251
00:13:06,431 --> 00:13:10,720
examples of how some of the greater 
norcos succeeded largely thanks to their

252
00:13:10,721 --> 00:13:14,470
influence on established institutions.
