1
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,690
The world's best country if you don't 
want to be alone.

2
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,180
This country has half the population of 
the United States,

3
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:17,210
but concentrated in an area the size of 
Illinois.

4
00:00:17,420 --> 00:00:20,210
It is the most densely populated country
on the planet.

5
00:00:20,390 --> 00:00:21,223
It's also been one of the fastest 
growing countries in the last few 

6
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:24,590
decades.
In less than 20 years,

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,600
Bangladesh has cut poverty in half.
Avi Leader in textile manufacturing only

8
00:00:33,811 --> 00:00:35,670
surpassed by China.
In fact,

9
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:36,593
I'm pretty sure your shirt,
your trousers or something else you're 

10
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:39,174
wearing right now was made bath.
Let's wait a minute because it is still 

11
00:00:41,971 --> 00:00:44,520
too soon to open the bottle of 
champagne.

12
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,140
Yes.
Bangladesh grows faster,

13
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:46,974
but still to date,
13 percent of their population lives on 

14
00:00:49,441 --> 00:00:54,270
less than $2 a day and that's 20 million
people add to this.

15
00:00:54,271 --> 00:00:55,104
The fact that Islam is the main religion
in the country and you get headlines 

16
00:00:58,231 --> 00:00:59,160
like this one

17
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:05,530
activity increased in Bangladesh in 
2016.

18
00:01:05,590 --> 00:01:06,423
I made global fall and attacks dislike 
the fact that Bangladesh has a secular 

19
00:01:09,461 --> 00:01:10,294
constitution.
Adulterous women are stoned to death in 

20
00:01:12,371 --> 00:01:13,204
some regions and 80 percent of the 
population agrees with changing the 

21
00:01:16,241 --> 00:01:17,074
legislation.
So that it meets the principles of 

22
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:19,930
Sharia law.
Meanwhile,

23
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:22,120
despite the radicalization of some 
citizens,

24
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:25,930
the prime minister shake of Ciena is a 
woman and the opposition leader,

25
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,310
a leader is also a woman.
So the situation that is far from quiet,

26
00:01:30,311 --> 00:01:34,930
especially given that in the next year,
2018 Bangladesh will hold elections that

27
00:01:34,931 --> 00:01:37,420
might be crucial for the future of the 
country.

28
00:01:42,550 --> 00:01:46,320
Questions that we find ourselves asking,
oh well Ken Bangladesh become an Islamic

29
00:01:46,321 --> 00:01:47,154
republic.
And why do we think Bangladesh is a 

30
00:01:49,141 --> 00:01:51,000
demographic time bomb?
Well,

31
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,680
today we are going to answer these 
questions,

32
00:01:52,681 --> 00:01:56,010
but before we do that,
let's take a look back out the history.

33
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:04,470
One Country to families and 1947,
the British empire,

34
00:02:04,471 --> 00:02:06,990
let's the Indian colonies become 
independence.

35
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,003
The parts were Hindu,
isn't was the main religion became what 

36
00:02:10,201 --> 00:02:11,130
today is known as

37
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:12,333
dm

38
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,600
with an Islamic majority became 
Pakistan,

39
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,300
but things are not as simple as they 
seem.

40
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:23,510
The listening pause ended up divided 
into two parts.

41
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:24,463
As you can see on the screen now,
India was in the middle and to the left 

42
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:29,660
and right there was Pakistan with a 
political system.

43
00:02:29,661 --> 00:02:32,480
Based on sharia law,
2,200 kilometers divided,

44
00:02:32,481 --> 00:02:34,700
these two paths that belonged to the 
same states,

45
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:38,450
and as you can imagine,
this just didn't work very well.

46
00:02:38,600 --> 00:02:39,433
In fact,
putting aside the fact that they have 

47
00:02:40,401 --> 00:02:42,260
the same religion,
these two paths,

48
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,153
while they had nothing in common,
they didn't even speak the same 

49
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,154
language.

50
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,130
Western Pakistanis

51
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:55,400
despise the eastern Pakistanis,
also known as the Bengalis and wanted to

52
00:02:55,401 --> 00:02:57,890
have their own country.
So in 1971,

53
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:02,950
the liberation war starting estimation 
say that somewhere between 300,000 and 3

54
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,710
million civilians died in the sport,
but as a result of brand new country,

55
00:03:10,711 --> 00:03:14,340
I was born and this was the People's 
Republic of Bangladesh.

56
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,610
This is also how Mujtaba Rahman,
or as they know him,

57
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,583
Bunka Bonduelle became the first 
president since Pakistan was an Islamic 

58
00:03:21,841 --> 00:03:24,720
country,
and Bangladesh hated Pakistan badly.

59
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:25,683
Bangor then do you designed the 
constitution that was completely 

60
00:03:28,591 --> 00:03:29,790
secular.
In fact,

61
00:03:29,820 --> 00:03:30,653
they followed the ideological fashion of
the time or the so called Arab 

62
00:03:33,721 --> 00:03:34,554
socialism.
This wasn't ideological cocktail that 

63
00:03:36,661 --> 00:03:40,750
combines authoritarian leaders,
a centralized economy and secularism.

64
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,403
Wait,
just a minute here because it really 

65
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:48,754
wasn't that easy for years later,
Bangor bands zoo and this whole family 

66
00:03:51,171 --> 00:03:54,480
died and acute atar made by those who 
supported Pakistan.

67
00:03:54,481 --> 00:03:58,850
You rule during the liberation war,
only his two daughters survived.

68
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,830
One of them shake a Siena is the current
prime minister,

69
00:04:01,940 --> 00:04:02,773
but let's look back at that cue to top 
after two years of political stability 

70
00:04:05,961 --> 00:04:10,490
in the influence of the CIA General Zia 
Rahman became the man in China.

71
00:04:10,570 --> 00:04:11,403
Sure

72
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:16,773
that his most controversial decisions 
was to give amnesty to the pro 

73
00:04:19,241 --> 00:04:20,074
Pakistani.
Therefore Islam as soldiers who killed 

74
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:23,343
Banga Bantu.
This is how the big ideological divide 

75
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,210
was created in Bangladesh.
On the one hand,

76
00:04:28,270 --> 00:04:30,760
we have the family and the political 
party of General Ramen.

77
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:35,410
The BNP or Bangladesh National Party,
they are a conservative coalition with a

78
00:04:35,411 --> 00:04:36,244
strong presence among isn't Mr parties,
some of those who participated in the 

79
00:04:39,481 --> 00:04:43,390
cute Atar.
In 1975 became members of the BNP party.

80
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:46,150
On the other hand,
we have the party of Bangor Bansi,

81
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,043
the circled Awami League.
They are considered socialist and 

82
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:55,140
secular.
Romans rule the country for four years.

83
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:01,560
Then of course,
then another cute Atar,

84
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:02,523
Bangladesh was ruled by the military 
until 1991 when democracy came back to 

85
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,410
the country,
but hold on a minute again here,

86
00:05:08,411 --> 00:05:09,244
because the Bangladesh way,
if democracy is pretty far from 

87
00:05:12,341 --> 00:05:17,341
democratic tree to women since 1991,
these two political parties had two main

88
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,760
leaders.
On the BNP side,

89
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:26,760
we have Kalita Zen,
the widow desire ramen.

90
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,660
On the army side there is shake Asina,
the daughter of Ngabantu.

91
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:31,553
Since then,
elections have been a fight between two 

92
00:05:33,061 --> 00:05:35,970
women.
This alternate empower every five years.

93
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:39,060
Neither one of them can win the 
elections consistently.

94
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,220
In fact,
elections in Bangladesh,

95
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:42,343
absolutely.

96
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:43,283
Hello,

97
00:05:46,830 --> 00:05:51,210
the opposition party organizers,
violence protests and paralyzing strikes

98
00:05:51,330 --> 00:05:52,470
that damage to the country,

99
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,020
but in 2006 well

100
00:05:58,070 --> 00:06:00,470
things they changed back then.
The Awami League,

101
00:06:00,471 --> 00:06:04,520
leds by shake Asina disagreed with the 
way that they organize the elections.

102
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,230
This was pretty business as usual,
but this time the military tried to make

103
00:06:09,231 --> 00:06:09,980
a cute.
It's odd,

104
00:06:09,980 --> 00:06:10,813
but some audit in the country like they 
had in the 19 eighties elections had to 

105
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:18,320
be postponed for two years and finally 
sheet casinos won the elections.

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:20,210
In that moment,
I learned a lesson.

107
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:22,820
The important thing is not winning the 
office.

108
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:23,953
Keeping

109
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,673
not.
Remember when I told you the general 

110
00:06:28,251 --> 00:06:29,084
robin gave amnesty to those.
You've killed Banga Bendu 40 years 

111
00:06:31,281 --> 00:06:32,240
before.
Well,

112
00:06:32,270 --> 00:06:33,103
his daughter shake Kasina had a pretty 
good memory and she took those memories 

113
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:40,110
from the past and decided to do 
something about those Islamists.

114
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,953
He might challenge power.
Those who participated in the 1975 at a 

115
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:49,241
time executes leader of largest Islamist
party.

116
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:53,420
If this wasn't enough,
she broke up.

117
00:06:53,421 --> 00:06:54,254
Uh,
one of the biggest political traditions 

118
00:06:55,491 --> 00:06:58,130
in Bangladesh.
Usually during an election,

119
00:06:58,131 --> 00:06:58,964
the parliaments would create a neutral 
governments in order to guarantee a 

120
00:07:01,401 --> 00:07:05,360
clean and fair process was not willing 
to leave power.

121
00:07:05,361 --> 00:07:06,194
The opposition boycotted the elections 
and to Siena one with 79 percent of the 

122
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,013
vote.
When ash ruling party wins after 

123
00:07:15,021 --> 00:07:18,350
boycotted vote.
I don't have the words now in 2017.

124
00:07:18,351 --> 00:07:21,650
Shake a scene or is the strongest leader
in Bangladesh's history,

125
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:22,573
and this is no little thing if we 
remember that this is a country of more 

126
00:07:24,921 --> 00:07:29,810
than 160 million inhabitants.
So the question is now,

127
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,450
is there anyone who can match a scene as
power?

128
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,940
Well,
the answer is actually yes.

129
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:39,913
Graphic bomb,
as we said at the beginning of the 20 

130
00:07:42,470 --> 00:07:44,960
million Bangladeshi citizens live in 
extreme poverty.

131
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:48,290
They are young and extremely religious.
In other words,

132
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:51,740
they are the perfect market for a 
radical Islamist movements.

133
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,930
And Yeah,
I know you might be saying right now,

134
00:07:53,931 --> 00:07:54,321
but.
Well,

135
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:57,740
Simon did not say that Bangladesh is one
of the fastest growing countries.

136
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:58,880
Well,
yes I did.

137
00:07:58,881 --> 00:08:01,550
And this is exactly why there's 20 
million poor citizens

138
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,103
problem.

139
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:11,423
Yes,
and if you want to start the populist 

140
00:08:12,091 --> 00:08:14,730
revolution never go to an extremely poor
country.

141
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:15,623
In fact,
most of the radical movements appear 

142
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:20,490
when countries are starting to grow or 
stepping out of a crisis.

143
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:21,503
This is your window of opportunity.
That is the moment when the worst off 

144
00:08:23,851 --> 00:08:28,080
citizens can feel jealous of those who 
are getting wealthier and wealthier.

145
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,850
Those $20 million impoverished citizens 
are imperfect targets for radicalization

146
00:08:33,090 --> 00:08:35,760
and it can be a real threats to our 
country stability.

147
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,893
This is why it terrorist attacks have 
been getting more and more frequent in 

148
00:08:39,571 --> 00:08:44,571
Bangladesh since 2013.
The victims are bloggers who claim to be

149
00:08:48,481 --> 00:08:51,240
atheists and trying to spread secularism
in the country.

150
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:54,030
That's the real wakeup call that came 
in.

151
00:08:54,031 --> 00:08:59,031
Two Thousand and 16 long letter should 
attack isis.

152
00:09:02,211 --> 00:09:03,044
Gunmen killed at least 22 people in the 
hostage crisis at Daca restaurant since 

153
00:09:06,561 --> 00:09:09,170
then shake us.
INA has been trying to stop terrorism.

154
00:09:09,260 --> 00:09:12,950
Nonetheless,
as I said in 2018 elections will be held

155
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,940
and the government is trying to gain 
support from that religious population.

156
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,953
This is why it has seen isn't letting 
Saudi Arabia invest $1,000,000,000 into 

157
00:09:20,931 --> 00:09:23,960
the building of 160 mosques throughout 
the country.

158
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:24,853
At the same time,
she is making it harder for women's who 

159
00:09:26,151 --> 00:09:30,450
inherits money and also making it easier
for young girls to marry much older.

160
00:09:30,451 --> 00:09:30,800
Yeah.

161
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:31,633
Amen.

162
00:09:41,210 --> 00:09:44,440
It doesn't stop there and Islamic 
propaganda group because half is that he

163
00:09:44,441 --> 00:09:47,510
Islam send their agenda with political 
suggestions.

164
00:09:47,511 --> 00:09:49,280
Do you have governments,
for instance,

165
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:53,240
they wanted the religious teachings 
given a radical mosques to be considered

166
00:09:53,241 --> 00:09:54,074
at the same level as any academic 
institution and against the odds shake 

167
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,880
Hasina has accepted that as well as 
other proposals from the radicals.

168
00:10:01,950 --> 00:10:02,783
Don't forget that she and her party are 
the ones that stands for secular values 

169
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:08,390
against a more traditional approach from
the BNP party.

170
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,360
So this leads us to the big question 
here.

171
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,770
Do you think Bangladesh is at risk of 
becoming a de facto Islamic republic,

172
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:23,693
or is this just a political game?
Sheik Hasina to strengthen her power 

173
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:28,190
before the elections?
