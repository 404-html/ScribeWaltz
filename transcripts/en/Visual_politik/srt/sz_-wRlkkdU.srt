1
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,570
Doesn't seem that lately a lot of movies
have been shot in London.

2
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:15,530
One example is bridget Jones's baby,
a movie from the Bridget Jones's soccer,

3
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:16,364
which I might've seen just look at the 
skyscrapers in the backgrounds of that 

4
00:00:20,211 --> 00:00:23,150
movie.
Those were simply not there in the first

5
00:00:23,151 --> 00:00:24,580
movie of the saga.
In fact,

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:28,790
London skyline has changed dramatically 
in the last 10 years alone,

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:29,713
and this is pretty surprising because 
we're not talking about an emerging 

8
00:00:31,731 --> 00:00:33,470
economies like China or

9
00:00:36,310 --> 00:00:37,610
actually

10
00:00:37,990 --> 00:00:38,823
the overall economy in the UK as an all 
performance that well over the last few 

11
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:42,911
years.
However,

12
00:00:42,911 --> 00:00:46,240
the London is another world entirely 
today.

13
00:00:46,241 --> 00:00:51,040
It is one of the four fastest growing 
capitals on the planet almost growing at

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,874
the same level as Dubai.
Their population has increased by 50 

15
00:00:55,331 --> 00:01:00,331
percent in the last few decades,
particularly odd on a continental Europe

16
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:09,370
where all countries are seeing overall 
population decline.

17
00:01:09,440 --> 00:01:10,273
Instead,
London has 3 million more inhabitants 

18
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,500
and not only that,
but in the finance wells,

19
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,460
London is now more important than New 
York City itself.

20
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:20,353
So now you might be wondering what 
exactly has happened in London that has 

21
00:01:22,491 --> 00:01:24,770
caused this massive success?
Well,

22
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,633
that's the question we're going to be 
answering in today is visual politic 

23
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:28,874
video ration.
The United Kingdom has always been a 

24
00:01:34,091 --> 00:01:37,720
country of immigrants and the London was
always the main destination.

25
00:01:37,780 --> 00:01:39,490
Nonetheless,
in the last decade,

26
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,353
immigration has apps and the sky 
rocketed after Poland's became a member 

27
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:49,000
of the European Union in 2004.
I lots of polls easily moved from Poland

28
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:51,310
to London because there was no visa 
required.

29
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:56,653
The same happens when Bulgaria,
Romania became part of the European 

30
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,793
Union in 2007.
This created a whole new influx of 

31
00:02:03,531 --> 00:02:07,070
immigrants adding to those already there
from India and Pakistan.

32
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:11,360
These European immigrants typically have
higher education and university degrees.

33
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,253
In fact,
today in London has a one point 7 

34
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:14,923
million highly skilled workers.
While New York has one point 6 million 

35
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:18,883
immigrants are not only working the jobs
that British people don't want to do 

36
00:02:21,831 --> 00:02:22,664
anymore.
Instead they are coming to the country 

37
00:02:24,021 --> 00:02:27,920
and starting their own businesses or 
getting hired in the high tech sector.

38
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:32,680
But Tom started his marketing business 
four years after arriving from Warsaw.

39
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,950
He now employs six people and four of 
them are British.

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:43,420
That's companies are far more than just 
job creating machines or economic growth

41
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:44,254
engines.
The fact that London has more educated 

42
00:02:45,851 --> 00:02:48,310
people means more bars,
more exhibitions,

43
00:02:48,311 --> 00:02:49,720
more culture.
In summary,

44
00:02:49,721 --> 00:02:52,420
it has more of all the things that make 
a city look cool.

45
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:53,560
For example,
well,

46
00:02:53,561 --> 00:02:56,440
where's the best known Peruvian 
restaurants outside of Peru?

47
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,393
Well,
according to all of the gastronomical 

48
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:00,290
guides,
it's restaurant called civic j,

49
00:03:00,350 --> 00:03:01,183
which of course is located in London.
This is how London has created a 

50
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:14,360
virtuous cycle that has attracted more 
and more people.

51
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:15,253
This is why in 2000 inmates,
after the financial crisis hits many 

52
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,970
Spaniards,
Portuguese and Italians,

53
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,260
who wanted to leave their countries,
saw London as the main destination.

54
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,540
It was more than just a good place to 
find a job.

55
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:27,740
It was a cool place.
The myths,

56
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:32,030
this is something that economists school
the network effect.

57
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,190
The more people and companies that you 
have,

58
00:03:34,191 --> 00:03:36,950
the easier it is to attract highly 
skilled immigrants.

59
00:03:37,510 --> 00:03:40,910
Today,
a new generation of coders,

60
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,200
bankers,
and financial wizards are remaking,

61
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:46,740
is extraordinary place.

62
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:47,753
Interestingly,
since 2010 over 1000 startups have been 

63
00:03:51,391 --> 00:03:52,224
created in London every single year,
but hold on a moment because there's 

64
00:03:56,701 --> 00:03:57,534
more.

65
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,800
Oh,

66
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:01,543
city of London.
All the skyscrapers that you see here 

67
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:04,723
are concentrated in a single area.
This is an area and not bigger than a 

68
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:11,270
square mile.
And it is known as the city of London or

69
00:04:11,271 --> 00:04:12,800
just with the city?
Yes.

70
00:04:12,801 --> 00:04:13,634
On the one hand we do have London and 
then also on the other hand we have the 

71
00:04:16,851 --> 00:04:17,684
city of London.
You have London essentially works like 

72
00:04:26,341 --> 00:04:28,770
it's own country within the United 
Kingdom.

73
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:29,693
Yes.
Now we normally say for Britain is made 

74
00:04:31,351 --> 00:04:33,540
up of four nations,
England,

75
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:35,430
Wales,
Scotland and Northern Ireland,

76
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:38,760
but really this is not exactly true.
In fact,

77
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:41,850
we should really add a fifth one and 
this is the city of London.

78
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,900
The city has its own laws and has its 
own

79
00:04:44,910 --> 00:04:45,743
mayor.
The city is the financial center of 

80
00:04:47,731 --> 00:04:50,010
Great Britain.
About 7,000

81
00:04:50,011 --> 00:04:53,600
people live in this city,
but each day 300,000

82
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,600
come to work and its banks,
brokerage firms and insurance companies.

83
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,360
London's mayor is the man we're showing 
on the screen now.

84
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:04,920
His name is Sidique Khan,
but the city of London has its own Lord,

85
00:05:04,921 --> 00:05:08,040
mayor,
and his name is Jeffrey months events.

86
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,010
One of the characteristics over the 
city,

87
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:13,080
also known as the square mile,
is the during elections,

88
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:16,290
both citizens and companies have the 
right to vote.

89
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,183
For example,
a Unilever has its headquarters in the 

90
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,620
square mile.
Therefore when elections come,

91
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,090
Unilever is allowed to.

92
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,053
Okay,

93
00:05:30,470 --> 00:05:31,303
so now you might be wondering,
does Unilever get the same voting power 

94
00:05:34,251 --> 00:05:35,720
as a smaller company?
Well,

95
00:05:35,721 --> 00:05:36,554
the answer is no.
There's a number of votes a company 

96
00:05:38,601 --> 00:05:39,434
gets.
Depends on how many people say 

97
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,800
employment in the city.
By the way,

98
00:05:49,941 --> 00:05:50,774
the music that is accompanying this 
video that you were listening to right 

99
00:05:53,091 --> 00:05:55,700
now is by a band called the forgotten 
voice.

100
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,180
There a pop rock bands from to you sent 
us that music to use in this video.

101
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,220
And if you like it and you would like to
hear more from them,

102
00:06:01,221 --> 00:06:02,054
it please do.
Check out the links in the description 

103
00:06:03,081 --> 00:06:03,914
below.

104
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:16,403
All right,
so now you might be wondering whether 

105
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:21,450
the city of London is a fiscal haven and
the answer is no.

106
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:22,373
All across the UK taxes off,
fairly similar to what is true is that 

107
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:26,634
the square mile does have more business 
friendly policies than the rest of the 

108
00:06:30,301 --> 00:06:31,650
UK,
for instance,

109
00:06:31,651 --> 00:06:32,484
that the development laws are much more 
free and open than the rest of the 

110
00:06:34,951 --> 00:06:35,784
country and this is why they're all more
skyscrapers bought when it comes to 

111
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:41,490
taxes.
They are not a haven whatsoever,

112
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,413
but it's.
Hold on just a minute because the city 

113
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:44,034
does play a really important role.
This is because the main task of the 

114
00:06:46,951 --> 00:06:47,784
Lord mayor is do traveled around the 
world and promote London as a great 

115
00:06:51,301 --> 00:06:52,134
place for doing

116
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,033
business.

117
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:56,463
Mayor of the city of London,
Alderman Alan Yarrow is believe that 

118
00:07:00,470 --> 00:07:01,303
business delegation to Indonesia,
helping to make sure London and the UK 

119
00:07:05,670 --> 00:07:06,503
remained the regional partner of choice 
when it comes to financial and 

120
00:07:09,751 --> 00:07:10,920
professional services.

121
00:07:13,930 --> 00:07:14,763
So you went away.
You can say that London has its own 

122
00:07:16,331 --> 00:07:17,164
marketing departments,
showcasing all of the benefits of doing 

123
00:07:19,511 --> 00:07:21,430
business there to the rest of the world

124
00:07:23,390 --> 00:07:23,960
business

125
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,793
concentration.
The US economy is divided among 

126
00:07:26,721 --> 00:07:28,340
different cities.
For example,

127
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:32,270
politics is centered in Washington DC.
Finance is in New York City.

128
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:33,143
Entertainment is in Los Angeles,
and technology is centered in San 

129
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,603
Francisco.
The same happens in Germany where you 

130
00:07:38,661 --> 00:07:40,790
have cities like Berlin,
Frankfurt,

131
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,010
and Munich,
andover.

132
00:07:42,020 --> 00:07:43,730
In Spain you have Barcelona,

133
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:45,073
correct.

134
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,450
On the other hands,
Britain has London as well,

135
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,284
just London.
The other larger cities are far less 

136
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:54,430
important to the country's economy.
In fact,

137
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:57,790
London generates every one in five 
pounds.

138
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,530
In the British economy.
In this city,

139
00:07:59,531 --> 00:08:02,350
you will find all of the major 
government institutions,

140
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,390
the banks,
the technological center,

141
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:05,470
the fashion center,

142
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,423
et Cetera.

143
00:08:10,770 --> 00:08:11,603
While the amount of tax generated in 
London increased by 25 percent in real 

144
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:16,874
terms between 2005 and 2015,
Manchester's fax intake by only one 

145
00:08:22,341 --> 00:08:23,390
percent.
Well,

146
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,253
Birmingham,
Glasgow and leads also significant 

147
00:08:27,261 --> 00:08:30,290
decreases in their vaccine take and the 
tool of this,

148
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:34,340
we should add another really important 
element and that's English.

149
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:35,263
As you probably know,
the UK has had a rather good 

150
00:08:37,041 --> 00:08:37,874
relationship with the United States,
well at least for the past two 

151
00:08:40,311 --> 00:08:43,430
centuries,
even though there is no trade agreements

152
00:08:43,431 --> 00:08:44,264
between the two countries.
They do have a lot of history in common 

153
00:08:47,090 --> 00:08:49,670
and importantly they speak the same 
language.

154
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:55,170
List

155
00:08:55,170 --> 00:08:56,590
fact that the United Kingdom

156
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:57,443
is currently a part of the European 
Union and so you can see why London has 

157
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:01,583
become the gateway for American 
companies who want to do business in 

158
00:09:04,471 --> 00:09:06,110
Europe.
What London does,

159
00:09:06,140 --> 00:09:06,973
it is the capital of the euro and that 
means that 70 percent of forex trading 

160
00:09:11,871 --> 00:09:14,480
and all sorts of other over the counter 
derivatives,

161
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,970
all sorts of fancy stuff gets done 
through London.

162
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,043
Although the UK is not in the euro,
so there's a very difficult set of 

163
00:09:21,410 --> 00:09:22,670
negotiations coming up.

164
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,413
But now the obvious and big question is 
going to be how is brexit going to 

165
00:09:33,081 --> 00:09:36,650
affect London's growth?
One thing is very clear and that's the.

166
00:09:36,651 --> 00:09:37,484
Well,
the majority of the British population 

167
00:09:38,721 --> 00:09:41,270
once it the UK,
to leave the European Union,

168
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:42,343
London wasn't very much.
