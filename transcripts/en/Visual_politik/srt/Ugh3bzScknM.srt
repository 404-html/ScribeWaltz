1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:11,020
Is to currencies.
What tinder is,

2
00:00:11,030 --> 00:00:13,400
taps.
Everybody loves to criticize it,

3
00:00:13,401 --> 00:00:14,234
but at the end of the day,
a lot of people wouldn't expect to use 

4
00:00:16,821 --> 00:00:18,110
it.
Totally do.

5
00:00:18,170 --> 00:00:19,003
I'm sure many of you have heard 
economists and experts have all kinds 

6
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:25,040
making predictions about the ends of the
single European currency

7
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:33,200
thing Germany could do for Europe is to 
quit the single currency,

8
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:37,520
but it won't.
Larry Elliott for the Guardian Euro,

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:38,363
is it patently flawed construct,
which it's architects knew at the time 

10
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:44,410
of its creation,
George Soros.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:47,390
Nevertheless,
the reality is way different.

12
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:48,313
In fact,
the euro is the second most common 

13
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,790
worldwide reserve currency and at the 
end of the video today,

14
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:53,624
you're going to see how it might not be 
far from being the first and at this 

15
00:00:57,111 --> 00:00:59,270
point you might be thinking,
but the u s dollars fast.

16
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:01,730
There's absolutely no way that's going 
anywhere,

17
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,370
but maybe I'm right.
Look,

18
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:08,960
one third of international trade uses 
the euro as its exchange currency.

19
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:09,823
Twenty percent of the reserve currencies
from central banks are denominated in 

20
00:01:13,281 --> 00:01:17,480
euros and many other countries also 
issue debt in this currency,

21
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:25,730
but this is not the end of the story.
If you follow visual politic every week,

22
00:01:25,731 --> 00:01:26,564
you already know that Donald trump is 
putting lots of terrorists on 

23
00:01:29,331 --> 00:01:31,970
international trade.
So what does that mean?

24
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,110
Well,
think about it.

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,690
If Americans are going to buy less stuff
abroad,

26
00:01:35,691 --> 00:01:38,420
there will be fewer dollars in 
circulation.

27
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:39,313
And then you've got to think about who's
signing free trade deals with seemingly 

28
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:44,510
everyone,
and of course that's the European Union.

29
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:46,550
They've already passed a treaty with 
Canada,

30
00:01:46,551 --> 00:01:50,450
the so-called seater,
but this is not the only one.

31
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:51,373
In the last two years,
Europe has reduced terrorists with 

32
00:01:52,851 --> 00:01:54,020
Japan,
Mexico,

33
00:01:54,021 --> 00:01:55,130
and many other countries.

34
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:02,190
In other words,
the more Europeans by abroad,

35
00:02:02,191 --> 00:02:04,410
the more euros there will be in 
circulation.

36
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,333
This means that could be a moment where 
instead of having one hegemonic reserve 

37
00:02:08,730 --> 00:02:09,563
currency,
we might have two US dollar and the 

38
00:02:12,631 --> 00:02:13,464
euro,
so I can probably guess what you're 

39
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,300
thinking right now.
I mean,

40
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,163
what good does this really do anyone?
Is it actually useful for the Europeans 

41
00:02:19,921 --> 00:02:22,800
to have the euro as their currency?
Well,

42
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,290
yeah,
and at the same time,

43
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,183
no.
If you're watching this from a country 

44
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,543
and you have a company,
well having the euro as the world's 

45
00:02:31,831 --> 00:02:33,780
reserve currency,
it's not going to help you,

46
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:39,580
but if

47
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,070
you're working for a European 
governments,

48
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,460
boy,
you're probably feeling really lucky.

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,413
If there's a big demand for euros,
the European Central Bank will have a 

50
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:52,150
bigger margins of prince money without 
devaluing it.

51
00:02:52,270 --> 00:02:53,103
Anyway,
we actually talked about this in our 

52
00:02:54,281 --> 00:02:57,310
video about the dollar.
If you haven't seen that one yet,

53
00:02:57,311 --> 00:02:59,620
you'll find a link in the description 
below.

54
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:00,483
Check it out after watching this one.
Now the big question is why is the euro 

55
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:07,300
more popular than any other currency?
For example,

56
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:08,134
why the euro and why not the Chinese 
yuan and why are so many economists 

57
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,420
critical of the Europe?
Well,

58
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:15,130
today we're going to answer these 
questions,

59
00:03:15,131 --> 00:03:17,410
but before we do,
as we always do,

60
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,500
let's take a look back at the history 
central crisis.

61
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,353
During the seventies,
European countries were happy to trade 

62
00:03:27,371 --> 00:03:28,204
with each other,
although there was no European Union 

63
00:03:29,621 --> 00:03:30,454
back then.
There was something very similar and 

64
00:03:32,111 --> 00:03:34,210
that was the common market.

65
00:03:34,330 --> 00:03:35,650
Nonetheless,
there was a problem.

66
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,573
Each country had its own national 
currency at each currency works in a 

67
00:03:40,301 --> 00:03:41,380
different way.
For example,

68
00:03:41,381 --> 00:03:46,210
the German market was strong and stable,
but the Italian lira was devaluing every

69
00:03:46,211 --> 00:03:47,800
other day.
You mentioned the situation,

70
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,690
you work in a German bank and do you 
lend a million layers?

71
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:52,533
Do An Italian company at the moment that
you lend at a million layers is worth a 

72
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:57,663
thousand German marks,
but when it's time for that Italian 

73
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:01,930
company to give you the money back,
the lira has been devalued.

74
00:04:01,931 --> 00:04:02,764
So even if you get a million lawyers 
back when you exchanged Clo who 

75
00:04:05,711 --> 00:04:09,280
currency,
you only get about 900 German marks,

76
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:11,740
not exactly business brilliance.

77
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:18,593
Alright,
so in order to avoid this European 

78
00:04:20,251 --> 00:04:22,470
politicians,
they met together in a room,

79
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:26,730
and I'm really not making this up.
Apparently they decided to try something

80
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:27,653
called verse snake in the tunnel.
So here's the snake is kind of a 

81
00:04:30,631 --> 00:04:34,590
metaphor for currency fluctuations 
because currencies go up and down,

82
00:04:34,591 --> 00:04:36,720
like apparently a snake,
it goes up and down.

83
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,580
So if you don't want the snake to go 
crazy,

84
00:04:38,581 --> 00:04:41,250
you make a tunnel and put the snake in 
the tunnel.

85
00:04:41,251 --> 00:04:42,084
That way the currency doesn't fluctuate.
Look for any possible excuse for this 

86
00:04:45,181 --> 00:04:47,550
sort of analogy was that it was the 19 
seventies.

87
00:04:47,551 --> 00:04:49,860
Bob Marley was alive.
Bell bottoms with trendy.

88
00:04:49,861 --> 00:04:52,140
It was just a really different time.

89
00:04:58,370 --> 00:04:59,750
Alright,
so importantly,

90
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:02,000
did this snake in the tunnel agreement 
work?

91
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,863
Well?
Now your dividends during the 19 

92
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:04,874
eighties,
European currencies went up and down 

93
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:09,590
like a drunk snake in a very wide 
tunnel.

94
00:05:09,591 --> 00:05:12,590
Trying to continue that terrible 
seventies metaphor.

95
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:16,970
This is why decades later European 
politicians met again in another room.

96
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:17,863
This time it was 1992 ads.
They had moved on from the ridiculous 

97
00:05:20,931 --> 00:05:21,764
names of the 19 seventies and they 
decided to call it the Maastricht 

98
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:24,704
treaty.
And then this one they got really 

99
00:05:25,431 --> 00:05:26,264
serious and said,
let's not fool around with any more 

100
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:29,960
snakes than any more tunnels.
That was weird.

101
00:05:29,961 --> 00:05:31,730
It was the seventies.
Let's just,

102
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,160
let's make a currency that everyone can 
use.

103
00:05:34,161 --> 00:05:37,790
There'll be no more exchange rates,
there'll be no more fluctuations that we

104
00:05:37,791 --> 00:05:39,920
no more bullshit that we had to deal 
with before.

105
00:05:40,010 --> 00:05:42,350
Alright,
everyone sound good and then essentially

106
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,280
Great Britain post lands up in is like,
guys,

107
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:46,100
I don't,
I don't.

108
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:46,933
I don't want to end with that.
I really liked my pound sterling and 

109
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:51,710
everyone else in the room was basically 
Geico yourself for doing this anyway,

110
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:55,580
and this is how a three step process to 
create a single currency started.

111
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,983
In 1999,
all the stock market started listing in 

112
00:06:05,811 --> 00:06:06,644
euros and later on European citizens 
started using the new coins for their 

113
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:11,023
daily traits.
Today we've all gotten used to hearing 

114
00:06:13,131 --> 00:06:15,230
about the euro like any other normal 
currency,

115
00:06:15,231 --> 00:06:17,690
but make no mistake.
Back then,

116
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,643
it was an unprecedented financial 
experiments and this is how the first 

117
00:06:22,851 --> 00:06:23,900
critics came to be

118
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,770
exemplifies situation unfavorable to a 
common currency.

119
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,113
It is composed of separate nations,
speaking different languages with 

120
00:06:36,181 --> 00:06:37,014
different customs and having citizens 
feeling far greater loyalty and 

121
00:06:40,981 --> 00:06:41,814
attachment to their own country than to 
a common market or to the idea of 

122
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:47,810
Europe.
Milton Friedman and I am.

123
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,380
One's a.
what's the problem?

124
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,310
We're the single currency unless easy.
If we have a single currency,

125
00:06:53,311 --> 00:06:54,144
that German bank we talked about before,
we'll have no problems sending money to 

126
00:06:57,421 --> 00:07:00,000
an Italian or a green company,
so.

127
00:07:00,001 --> 00:07:00,834
Well,
what happens then?

128
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,880
Well,
since there's no currency risk of German

129
00:07:02,881 --> 00:07:05,520
banks,
you have a lot of money lender to poorer

130
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:07,470
Italian,
Greek and Spanish companies.

131
00:07:07,530 --> 00:07:10,080
All of a sudden,
rich countries have started to invest in

132
00:07:10,081 --> 00:07:14,180
poor countries like there is no tomorrow
and yet.

133
00:07:14,181 --> 00:07:15,014
Yeah,
I can probably guess what you're 

134
00:07:15,061 --> 00:07:17,940
thinking right now.
What's the problem with all of this?

135
00:07:17,941 --> 00:07:19,860
It sounds pretty great.
Well,

136
00:07:19,861 --> 00:07:22,040
the problem comes with the crisis.

137
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:30,460
Banks must take bigger losses on Greek 
loans,

138
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,563
says German finance minister.
Basically the southern European 

139
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:37,300
economies that poor a weekend when 
there's a crisis,

140
00:07:37,301 --> 00:07:39,430
their companies are the first ones to go
bankrupt,

141
00:07:39,431 --> 00:07:41,410
so if companies can't pay their debts 
back,

142
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,244
the banks can go bankrupt too,
and this is what we call the risk of 

143
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:46,653
contagion.
This explains why during the 2008 

144
00:07:48,731 --> 00:07:49,564
crisis,
so many politicians and economists 

145
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:54,760
suggested abandoning the euro.
One of them talked about the creation of

146
00:07:54,761 --> 00:07:55,594
two different years,
one for the wealthy countries who are 

147
00:07:57,221 --> 00:08:01,690
solid and stable and another kind of 
shitty year for the poorer countries and

148
00:08:01,691 --> 00:08:04,960
that kind of week a year a,
they'd just be happy to evaluate as they

149
00:08:04,961 --> 00:08:06,100
want.
Nonetheless,

150
00:08:06,101 --> 00:08:06,934
today the euro,
it's still alive and kicking and it 

151
00:08:08,861 --> 00:08:12,550
wasn't split into two different parts.
So why was this?

152
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:14,710
Well,
let's roll into the next section.

153
00:08:19,710 --> 00:08:23,920
The chaos critics are rice.
The European Central Bank,

154
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:28,270
also known as the ECB is a modern day 
tower of Babel.

155
00:08:28,510 --> 00:08:30,450
It works similarly to a country's

156
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:31,323
government.

157
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:38,000
The current president is a man named 
Mario Draghi,

158
00:08:38,001 --> 00:08:41,030
and the executive board is something 
like the executive power,

159
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:44,990
but there's also a legislative power and
that's the governing council.

160
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:48,650
This is where you have representatives 
from all of the eurozone countries.

161
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,720
This one from Spain,
this one from France,

162
00:08:50,721 --> 00:08:51,800
Germany,
Slovenia,

163
00:08:51,950 --> 00:08:52,783
well,
all the countries that have the euro as 

164
00:08:54,681 --> 00:08:55,514
their currency,
these guys that the real decision 

165
00:08:57,361 --> 00:08:58,194
makers,
they decide whether to raise or lower 

166
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:02,730
interest rates or prince more or less 
money,

167
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,390
but before they do,
they have to reach an agreement and this

168
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,540
is where the problems really start.
The southern European countries,

169
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:12,120
they want to print more money,
but the northern neighbors,

170
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,880
they don't.
Since they can't come to an agreement,

171
00:09:14,910 --> 00:09:17,700
it's almost impossible to make drastic 
decision.

172
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:27,510
Now this is all true and the problem is,
well actually where is the problem?

173
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,223
I mean,
where is the problem in having a 

174
00:09:30,281 --> 00:09:31,114
currency that cannot be devalued because
those who are in charge of printing is 

175
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:36,340
don't agree with each other.
I mean,

176
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,233
isn't this actually a strength?
We've talked about this hundreds of 

177
00:09:38,951 --> 00:09:42,400
times on visual politic.
The best currency is the strongest one.

178
00:09:42,401 --> 00:09:44,260
If the value of your money doesn't 
change,

179
00:09:44,261 --> 00:09:45,094
there is low inflation and you can do 
your shopping without being afraid of 

180
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,780
losing all your money.
You could also,

181
00:09:49,781 --> 00:09:50,614
if you wanted to start a tech company,
because you know you can invest long 

182
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:55,360
term,
so now you might be wondering,

183
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:58,390
well Simon is the euro actually that 
stable?

184
00:09:58,510 --> 00:09:59,620
Well,
have a look at this

185
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:00,573
shops

186
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:08,750
here you can see a comparison between 
the monetary supply,

187
00:10:08,751 --> 00:10:09,584
the so-called m two,
if the ECB and the American Federal 

188
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,443
Reserve.
Can you see how they go hand in hand in 

189
00:10:15,831 --> 00:10:16,664
less than 20 years,
the euro has become as solid as the 

190
00:10:18,921 --> 00:10:20,090
American dollar.
In fact,

191
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,933
Europeans have already forgotten what 
infection even is for a better 

192
00:10:23,991 --> 00:10:24,824
understanding.
The American Federal Reserve has two 

193
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:27,793
main goals,
keeping inflation low and keeping 

194
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:30,283
unemployment low as well.
European Central Bank instead has just 

195
00:10:33,651 --> 00:10:34,484
one goal on their agenda and that's 
monetary stability and so far all 

196
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,440
they've achieved it.
So yeah,

197
00:10:39,441 --> 00:10:43,790
we can see that the euro is as solid and
abundant as the US dollar,

198
00:10:43,791 --> 00:10:44,624
but the question is now,
could it be even more solid and even 

199
00:10:47,631 --> 00:10:51,050
more abundance?
And the short answer is yeah.

200
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,280
Today the eurozone has around $320 
million inhabitants.

201
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,920
That's almost the same as the United 
States,

202
00:10:57,980 --> 00:11:02,210
but despite the European economy being 
smaller than the American one,

203
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,910
the euro zone can increase as long as 
new countries joining.

204
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:07,320
Yeah,

205
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:11,333
the last 10 years,
six new countries have adopted the euro 

206
00:11:14,121 --> 00:11:14,954
as their currency and despite the fact 
that the political climate is not 

207
00:11:18,051 --> 00:11:23,030
currently very much in favor of it,
Poland or the Nordic countries might end

208
00:11:23,031 --> 00:11:25,880
up joining the euro at some point as 
well.

209
00:11:26,120 --> 00:11:28,740
This wasn't enough.
There are many other currencies that are

210
00:11:28,790 --> 00:11:29,623
linked to the array.
Do you remember in a previous video we 

211
00:11:31,011 --> 00:11:34,790
talked about French colonies in Africa.
In that video we said how countries like

212
00:11:34,791 --> 00:11:39,320
the Ivory Coast and Senegal have a 
common currency called the CFA franc.

213
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:43,670
This currency is actually linked to the 
euro and we're talking about more than a

214
00:11:43,690 --> 00:11:46,990
hundred and 50 million people in 
emerging economies here.

215
00:11:47,090 --> 00:11:49,700
In other words,
with so many people using euros in their

216
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:52,250
daily lives,
there are enough coins out there to make

217
00:11:52,251 --> 00:11:55,300
it easy for any company to get their 
hands on them.

218
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:56,650
As an now you might be thinking,
well,

219
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:57,191
yes,
I'm in.

220
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:00,010
A lot of people do use the euro,
no doubt,

221
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:03,220
but you know who else has a lot of users
that Chinese yuan.

222
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,233
This is also known as the renminbi and 
it's becoming more and more fashionable 

223
00:12:07,601 --> 00:12:08,740
these days.
Well,

224
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:12,700
so why are we using euros instead of 
Renminbi is well,

225
00:12:12,850 --> 00:12:13,683
that's

226
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,470
the laws of the UN.
Well,

227
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,770
you're absolutely right.
China is full of a lot of people who are

228
00:12:22,771 --> 00:12:24,960
using this currency for that day.
You transactions.

229
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:25,823
This means high demand for this currency
and lots of notes and lots of coins in 

230
00:12:29,341 --> 00:12:30,930
circulation.
At first glance,

231
00:12:30,931 --> 00:12:31,764
this should be enough for the nuance,
become an international reserve 

232
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,780
currency,
but there is a problem.

233
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,233
Put 15,000 United States dollars and you
will personal cap on overseas bank card 

234
00:12:45,550 --> 00:12:47,410
withdrawals.
Yeah.

235
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:48,190
Yeah.
That ride.

236
00:12:48,190 --> 00:12:51,010
China does not want us to leave the 
country.

237
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,040
This is why they put lots of capital 
controls in place.

238
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:54,903
In other words,
finding new ones in the international 

239
00:12:55,991 --> 00:12:57,910
markets.
It's not an easy job.

240
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,580
In fact,
China wants to avoid Chinese businessman

241
00:13:00,581 --> 00:13:02,410
taking money out of the country.
Hence,

242
00:13:02,411 --> 00:13:03,244
the Chinese People's Bank has lots and 
lots of restrictions and as you can 

243
00:13:06,581 --> 00:13:09,160
imagine in a dictatorship like that 
Chinese one,

244
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:12,130
it's hard to believe in the independence
of their central bank.

245
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:13,960
In other words,
if she needed to,

246
00:13:13,961 --> 00:13:14,794
he could simply changed the rules and 
just stopped printing as much money as 

247
00:13:16,871 --> 00:13:17,704
he wants it.

248
00:13:21,290 --> 00:13:22,360
Don't believe me.
Well,

249
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,400
the political system doesn't affect the 
currency.

250
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:26,623
If you do,
you should probably watch a video on 

251
00:13:27,801 --> 00:13:28,634
Turkey.
They all see what happens when you mix 

252
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:34,920
authoritarianism and economic crisis and
it's not good for now though,

253
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:35,833
it's your turn.
Do you think the euro can become as 

254
00:13:37,341 --> 00:13:38,174
important as the dollar or maybe we see 
a brand new crisis destroying the 

255
00:13:41,601 --> 00:13:42,434
European single currency.
