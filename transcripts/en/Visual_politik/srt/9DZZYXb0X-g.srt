1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,300
Here's the question,
anyone had a faker,

2
00:00:09,880 --> 00:00:11,560
sk telecom fans?
Well,

3
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:15,480
those over 30 the slightest clue what 
I'm talking about.

4
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,200
I'm talking about some of the most 
famous players after the eeg of legends,

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:21,290
League of legends,
also known as lol,

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:22,133
due to its initials,
is one of the most successful video 

7
00:00:24,181 --> 00:00:25,620
games in the world.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:29,730
Yes.

9
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,813
How'd that rise?
Many may think the video games aren't 

10
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:33,003
simply a domestic form of entertainment 
with either game we'd play as is home 

11
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:40,660
alone or with our friends and that's 
pretty much it writes well,

12
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:44,290
Dev view out nothing could be further 
from the truth.

13
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:48,413
The surgeon will open its first use 
sports stadium in Los Angeles next 

14
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:52,820
month.
Yup.

15
00:00:52,820 --> 00:00:55,670
That is really something that's 
happening nowadays.

16
00:00:55,671 --> 00:00:56,504
Video Games have become a mass sport 
almost on the same level as football or 

17
00:01:00,651 --> 00:01:04,340
formula one,
giving you an idea only in 2017.

18
00:01:04,370 --> 00:01:09,110
East sports that is electronic sports 
moved more than one point $5,000,000,000

19
00:01:09,111 --> 00:01:11,960
through sponsorships,
merchandising and investment.

20
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:16,913
Yeah.
Now that is still a little compared to 

21
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:20,100
the $8,000,000,000.
The Formula One moves,

22
00:01:20,101 --> 00:01:20,934
for example,
but it isn't bad if we consider that 

23
00:01:22,471 --> 00:01:26,040
this new mass sport isn't even 10 years 
old.

24
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:27,053
To give you an idea,
the first league of Legends World 

25
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,050
Championship was held in 2011 and had an
audience of about $200,000.

26
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:37,680
Seven years later,
in 2016,

27
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,310
more than 14 million people from around 
the world saw the final match.

28
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,970
These figures are only a little bit 
lower than the ones we could find for an

29
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,920
NBA final,
but not much lower.

30
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:51,463
Now,
league of legends broadcast even have 

31
00:01:52,351 --> 00:01:54,590
their own commentators in various 
languages.

32
00:01:55,130 --> 00:01:57,500
Where do you think sports are the most 
popular?

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,310
Of course that would be an Asia.
In countries like China or South Korea,

34
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:04,340
their accounts for more than 60 percent 
of video games audience,

35
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,233
unlike Formula One,
which never really took hold in this 

36
00:02:06,531 --> 00:02:07,364
part of the world.
East sports have really stuck and 

37
00:02:09,711 --> 00:02:13,070
logically this has led to an uproar in 
the investor as well.

38
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:19,643
Intel,
HP announced record investment e-sports 

39
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:22,831
industry.
However,

40
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,340
the Internet and new technologies have 
always been the perfect breeding grounds

41
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:30,300
for generating financial bubbles that 
explode in a rather big way.

42
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,780
We've all heard about the.com crisis at 
the beginning of the 21st century or the

43
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:38,310
downtown companies like snapchat took.
So the question is,

44
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,263
are we really talking about a new sport 
or is this simply just another bubble 

45
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,730
kind of massport simply be created from 
nothing just by investing money?

46
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:49,500
Well,
we're going to answer these questions in

47
00:02:49,501 --> 00:02:51,000
today's video,
but first,

48
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,290
let's take a look at the history.

49
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,990
Who invented

50
00:02:56,990 --> 00:03:01,210
Formula One in 2015 group of investors 
go to liberty media,

51
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:03,160
but what Formula One you might be 
wondering,

52
00:03:03,161 --> 00:03:05,410
well,
how can someone buy a sport?

53
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:07,390
Well,
the truth is that Formula One,

54
00:03:07,391 --> 00:03:09,280
in addition to being a sports 
competition,

55
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:14,340
is also actually a after the second 
world war with the cars democratization,

56
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:21,690
a massive public emerged who loved 
seeing the fastest cars in the world and

57
00:03:21,691 --> 00:03:22,524
his car manufacturers.
They were happy to participate in these 

58
00:03:23,931 --> 00:03:24,764
races.
Competitions gave them the perfect 

59
00:03:26,421 --> 00:03:30,050
excuse to test their latest engines.
To give you an idea of this formula,

60
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:30,884
one car can cost millions of dollars 
even though it's never intended for the 

61
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:35,300
consumer markets.
However,

62
00:03:35,301 --> 00:03:39,830
the technology it uses ends up being 
implemented in utilitarian cars,

63
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,160
for example,
disc brakes,

64
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:46,161
so active suspension innovations born in
formula throughout these years.

65
00:03:49,341 --> 00:03:50,174
The only instate in job regulating and 
stick teasing the competition rules was 

66
00:03:54,141 --> 00:03:58,060
the international automobile federation,
also known as the eye.

67
00:03:58,910 --> 00:03:59,743
However,
the real business didn't emerge until 

68
00:04:00,951 --> 00:04:05,951
the seventies when this guy came along.
This is Bernie ecclestone something.

69
00:04:10,401 --> 00:04:14,060
If the tuner of speed,
I Colston was the owner of a Formula One

70
00:04:14,061 --> 00:04:14,894
team.
He immediately realized that this sport 

71
00:04:16,071 --> 00:04:16,904
was a money making machine,
but the business was neither in the 

72
00:04:20,061 --> 00:04:22,370
prizes nor in the car companies.

73
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,210
The real money was in selling tv 
transmission rights around the wells.

74
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,630
Now,
what do you think Bernie did?

75
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:31,750
Hip well,
he partnered with the other teams,

76
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,673
went to the IAF headquarters and told 
them either you give us transmission 

77
00:04:35,591 --> 00:04:40,120
rights so that we can manage them well.
We stopped running and your out of races

78
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:46,700
and that is how what we know today as 
the Formula One group was born.

79
00:04:46,730 --> 00:04:47,563
That is,
it's a sport that became the company 

80
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:52,040
that is even listed on the New York 
Stock Exchange.

81
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,830
In other words,
on the one hand we have the IAF which is

82
00:04:54,831 --> 00:04:55,664
in charge of organizing the racism,
creating the regulations so that 

83
00:04:57,831 --> 00:05:00,390
everyone can meet on equal terms.
It was on the other hands,

84
00:05:00,410 --> 00:05:02,840
the one who really has all the money as 
the Formula One group,

85
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:05,930
and we're not just talking about a few 
dollars here and 2011.

86
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:10,580
They made a profit of over one point 
$5,000,000,000.

87
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:13,690
Hmm.

88
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,270
And when we talk about billions of 
dollars,

89
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:16,980
it's.
It's easy to get lost in the figures and

90
00:05:16,981 --> 00:05:19,200
not really know how much that is worth,
but put it this way,

91
00:05:19,201 --> 00:05:20,034
the Burj Khalifa,
the tallest building in the world could 

92
00:05:21,451 --> 00:05:23,250
be built with that kind of money.
Now,

93
00:05:23,251 --> 00:05:24,084
as you can imagine,
these two organizations that often 

94
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,150
fighting and they do have a lot of legal
conflicts because they will.

95
00:05:29,151 --> 00:05:30,210
Now you might be wondering,
well,

96
00:05:30,211 --> 00:05:31,044
how does Formula One make any money?
Now pay attention here because this is 

97
00:05:34,261 --> 00:05:36,510
going to help us analyze e-sports,
veteran a moments.

98
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:37,523
Most of the money comes from 
transmission rights and from the 

99
00:05:39,331 --> 00:05:40,164
payments that municipalities and 
different governments make to host any 

100
00:05:42,631 --> 00:05:43,464
of the races in that cities.
Those two things alone account for 60 

101
00:05:47,581 --> 00:05:48,414
percent of the income.
The rest is made with companies 

102
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,224
sponsorships.
That is advertising and merchandise 

103
00:05:53,071 --> 00:05:57,070
sales and so in other words,
the too long didn't read version is yes,

104
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,100
the company can create a big sport and 
make billions of dollars from it,

105
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:03,950
from essentially nothing.
Now the question is,

106
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:06,860
can e-sports replicate this business 
model?

107
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:08,270
Well,
let's dive into that right now.

108
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,840
Pixels to legends,
just like car racing,

109
00:06:14,841 --> 00:06:18,410
video game competitions are as old as 
video games themselves.

110
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:22,430
The first major tournament was held in 
1972 at Stanford University.

111
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,730
More than 10,000 people gathered to see 
the best space wall players.

112
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:31,220
It's baseball.
It was one of these old video games with

113
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:36,221
big pixels and eight bit music.
In those years.

114
00:06:36,411 --> 00:06:39,670
Video Games hardly had multiplayer 
systems and internet connections that he

115
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,120
existed,
so in other words,

116
00:06:41,121 --> 00:06:43,820
in those times it was very haunting,
organize any competition that was really

117
00:06:43,821 --> 00:06:47,150
worth seeing.
So just as in Formula One came about,

118
00:06:47,151 --> 00:06:47,984
when most people started having cars in 
east sports came when most people 

119
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:51,554
started having high speed Internet 
connections and you might be able to 

120
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,240
guess the first country where 
competitions were hell's.

121
00:06:56,330 --> 00:07:00,430
Yep,
it was South Korea in 2006.

122
00:07:00,431 --> 00:07:04,750
South Korea was the country with the 
fastest Internet on the planet's ended.

123
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:05,613
That time,
half of the population had broadband 

124
00:07:06,701 --> 00:07:07,840
connections.
In other words,

125
00:07:07,841 --> 00:07:08,674
this was the perfect breeding grounds 
for the first big halo or starcraft 

126
00:07:11,951 --> 00:07:12,784
players to emerge.
And so how did these plants become 

127
00:07:14,801 --> 00:07:15,634
famous?
Well,

128
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:20,640
that's through streaming platforms such 
as youtube or above will twitch.tv,

129
00:07:20,830 --> 00:07:25,210
and that is essentially how east sports 
fever broke out in South Korea.

130
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:32,150
Souls getting a new dedicated esports 
stadium come March 2016.

131
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,393
Now.
You may be wondering who would be the 

132
00:07:37,420 --> 00:07:42,070
Bernie ecclestone of eastport and well 
balanced is riot games.

133
00:07:45,010 --> 00:07:48,400
This is the company that created the 
most successful game of all time,

134
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,460
League of legends,
which was released in 2009.

135
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:55,660
We talking about a video game that seems
to have been made for competitions.

136
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:57,430
I mean check this out too,
that time.

137
00:07:57,431 --> 00:07:59,440
Online games where,
how do we say it?

138
00:07:59,441 --> 00:08:00,274
A bit rudimentary.
Of course there were titles like world 

139
00:08:01,901 --> 00:08:04,060
of warcraft,
which had fantastic graphics and a great

140
00:08:04,061 --> 00:08:06,580
story,
but these were role playing game,

141
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:10,000
which one can play for hours and never 
win and never lose.

142
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,490
Also,
you have to pay a monthly fee to pay and

143
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,790
not everyone can afford that.
However,

144
00:08:16,791 --> 00:08:17,624
at League of legends is free,
has great graphics and an unbeatable 

145
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:23,000
game.
Mode and games last for about an hour.

146
00:08:23,060 --> 00:08:26,180
They have a winning and losing team in a
very short time.

147
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,820
This video game gained millions of 
players around them.

148
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:31,463
They were connected by the Internet.
The teams that were created were 

149
00:08:33,601 --> 00:08:35,550
completely international.
For example,

150
00:08:35,551 --> 00:08:37,470
at one of the best nine groups known as 
origin,

151
00:08:37,471 --> 00:08:40,080
has Spanish,
French and finished plans.

152
00:08:40,170 --> 00:08:45,170
The truth is the by the year 2011,
they had a critical mass of users and to

153
00:08:48,581 --> 00:08:49,414
celebrate it,
they went to an industry festival that 

154
00:08:50,501 --> 00:08:51,334
was being held in Sweden.
They had an audience and they place to 

155
00:08:53,681 --> 00:08:54,514
celebrate the championship,
allowing their players to share their 

156
00:08:56,641 --> 00:08:57,474
screens on youtube or twitch was enough 
to offer a show on an international 

157
00:09:00,811 --> 00:09:02,290
scale,
and as we always say it,

158
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,510
as it was said,
so it was

159
00:09:05,910 --> 00:09:06,743
done.

160
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:13,240
Championship reaches 900,000 viewers.
One thing was clear,

161
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:16,750
there was an audience he wanted to watch
matches from their favorite game on that

162
00:09:16,751 --> 00:09:20,710
computer screens from the initial 
900,000 spectators,

163
00:09:20,711 --> 00:09:21,544
we now have surpassed more than 14 
million and the players who are now 

164
00:09:24,851 --> 00:09:27,910
professionals travel around the wells on
athlete visas.

165
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,880
This means that from the institutional 
point of view,

166
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:31,823
League of legends is now considered a 
rightful sport and swear there's an 

167
00:09:35,411 --> 00:09:36,244
audience.
There are also companies willing to pay 

168
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:39,550
for publicity.
Don't forget,

169
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,920
we're talking about video games.
Yeah,

170
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,660
a perfect environment to sell computers,
graphics,

171
00:09:43,661 --> 00:09:44,740
cards,
screens,

172
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:45,663
or even high speed Internet connection.
It's every technology company has 

173
00:09:53,621 --> 00:09:58,090
recently decided to sponsor events.
As you can imagine,

174
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,680
that's where the gains come from as 
there are also huge investors willing to

175
00:10:02,681 --> 00:10:03,514
invest in this industry.
It's investment research highlights 

176
00:10:08,471 --> 00:10:09,304
three east stocks to watch.
It's clear east sports or a business 

177
00:10:12,191 --> 00:10:15,610
that is growing by leaps and bounds,
but how far can it go?

178
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:16,593
Good.
We'd be talking about the new Formula 

179
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:21,430
One.
Well,

180
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:22,293
if you remember,
we mentioned that most of Formula One's 

181
00:10:23,621 --> 00:10:24,454
income comes from the rights sold to TV 
network to now he's some broadcast 

182
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,853
openly,
freely through online streaming 

183
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,640
platforms.
Therefore,

184
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:37,500
there doesn't seem to be a big 
television business here.

185
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,700
As on the other hand,
so far,

186
00:10:38,701 --> 00:10:39,534
new governments or municipalities have 
seemed willing to pay to host a 

187
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:43,380
tournament.
In other words,

188
00:10:43,381 --> 00:10:47,190
for me to one has a diversified business
with different income streams,

189
00:10:47,191 --> 00:10:49,050
which means that even in times of 
crisis,

190
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:51,120
the company continues to make an income.

191
00:10:56,820 --> 00:10:57,653
At the moment it seems that the bulk of 
esports income depends largely on their 

192
00:11:00,971 --> 00:11:04,870
sponsors and by definition sponsor based
businesses are on stable,

193
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,733
but above all,
the biggest problem with this type of 

194
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:08,104
sports is variety.
There's only one formula one does that 

195
00:11:10,601 --> 00:11:11,434
mean one football,
but there are lots of esports and we 

196
00:11:13,961 --> 00:11:16,720
don't know which ones were lost and 
which ones worked.

197
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:19,750
League of legends has achieved and 
undeniable amounts of success,

198
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:22,300
but it was created in 2009.
I mean,

199
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:26,160
will it still be fashionable in another 
10 years or will a new electronic sports

200
00:11:26,161 --> 00:11:27,370
emerge that will pick up

201
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,660
that awesome.

202
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:35,670
No mistake.
The sports,

203
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:36,563
they're here to stay.
The question is which one is worth 

204
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:41,070
investing in in the long run?
Of course,

205
00:11:41,071 --> 00:11:44,100
these are all reasonable doubts for any 
new industry and uncertain.

206
00:11:44,101 --> 00:11:46,860
No circumstances do we want to 
underestimate this phenomenon.

207
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:49,290
That's as we always say,
a visual politic.

208
00:11:49,350 --> 00:11:51,660
Not Everything is as it seems and the 
devil,

209
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:56,440
whether it's in the detail.
Having said that,

210
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,363
I'll leave you with this question.
Would you invest in an sports company 

211
00:11:59,650 --> 00:12:00,483
right now?
Do you think we're facing a new mass 

212
00:12:02,310 --> 00:12:03,143
sport that will generate millions of 
dollars swelled and leave your onset in

and if you want to know more about 

214

this case that have electric cars,

215
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,603
we tell you about that in this other 
video where we look at the competition 

216
00:12:14,621 --> 00:12:17,080
between Tesla and BMW.
