1
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:10,460
We can't hide it here,
a visual politic.

2
00:00:10,490 --> 00:00:12,190
We Love Asia,
man,

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,033
that's poorly because we believe that 
the world sends him is already on this 

4
00:00:16,461 --> 00:00:21,461
continent,
but in the last few decades,

5
00:00:25,001 --> 00:00:28,360
one country has stood out of that crowd 
and that's country,

6
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:29,470
whether it's China

7
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:36,770
for its huge size and the speed of which
this country is growing.

8
00:00:36,771 --> 00:00:37,604
China deserves to be given the chief 
role in this super production that is 

9
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:43,280
changing our harness,
but wait just a second,

10
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:45,400
let's not rush into this whole thing.
China,

11
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:47,690
it's certainly not perfect.
Indeed.

12
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:50,960
The country has some pretty major 
problems.

13
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:53,390
On the 23rd of May,
2017,

14
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,283
Moody's,
one of the three agencies in charge of 

15
00:00:56,031 --> 00:00:59,570
rating the solvency and risk of 
financial products downgraded the rating

16
00:00:59,571 --> 00:01:00,404
of China's debt and this is the first 
reduction Moody's has made on China's 

17
00:01:05,001 --> 00:01:07,970
debt in 27 years.
Okay.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:08,833
Now I know what you're thinking.
Moody's really raising agencies in 

19
00:01:11,121 --> 00:01:11,954
general.
I mean they rarely seem to get it right 

20
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:15,170
and yeah,
while it is true,

21
00:01:15,171 --> 00:01:17,180
it is also one of the only things that 
we have to judge.

22
00:01:17,181 --> 00:01:18,014
This sort of thing is still 
overwhelmingly rely on standard and 

23
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:24,680
Poor's Moody's and Fitch when deciding 
whether to buy bonds,

24
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,190
the three issue more than 95 percent of 
global bond ratings.

25
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,880
The thing is,
do you view as China has faced two major

26
00:01:31,881 --> 00:01:35,600
threats in the last few years,
less growth and much,

27
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:37,580
much more debt.
In fact,

28
00:01:37,670 --> 00:01:41,900
this has even led to unimportant 
question Cam China go back

29
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:42,733
crops.

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,023
China's great growth.
If we had a time machine and the 

31
00:01:49,671 --> 00:01:51,950
opportunity to travel back to Mao's 
China,

32
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,813
the country we would find would be 
completely different to the one that we 

33
00:01:55,941 --> 00:01:58,340
find today.
There wouldn't be any skyscrapers,

34
00:01:58,341 --> 00:01:59,870
any malls.
In fact,

35
00:01:59,871 --> 00:02:03,350
there really wouldn't be much of 
anything in the 19 seventies.

36
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:08,380
China was a mainly agricultural country 
and it was extremely painful.

37
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,080
A few years often now had died and man 
known as Dung Xiaoping came to power.

38
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,650
He realized that communism,
well,

39
00:02:21,651 --> 00:02:25,140
it really hadn't worked.
It's all immediately put into practice a

40
00:02:25,141 --> 00:02:29,810
set of measures that would change China 
for rather these reforms and be changed.

41
00:02:29,811 --> 00:02:30,644
The China has gone through since they're
actually going to be the subject of an 

42
00:02:32,311 --> 00:02:33,144
upcoming visual politic video,
so please don't forget to subscribe to 

43
00:02:35,821 --> 00:02:40,821
this channel right now.
All right,

44
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:45,000
done that well.
That's carry on for now.

45
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:46,980
It's important to you.
Remember something done.

46
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:51,480
Joe Ping was a turning point for China.
Since then,

47
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:52,314
China has undergone the greatest 
economic revolution in the history of 

48
00:02:54,811 --> 00:02:57,000
mankind.
The last three decades.

49
00:02:57,001 --> 00:03:00,100
China has managed to take $500 people 
out of poverty

50
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,890
and to become the largest industrial and
trading power on the planet.

51
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,233
In other words,
if we ask any Chinese person about his 

52
00:03:07,161 --> 00:03:07,994
or her living standards,
the answer will be now is infinitely 

53
00:03:11,331 --> 00:03:16,331
better than it was before.
Please don't get me wrong,

54
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:21,820
there is still a lot of poverty in 
China,

55
00:03:21,821 --> 00:03:24,980
but compared to how it was,
it's a whole lot better today,

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:25,873
but as long as I was saying earlier,
it's certainly not all roses and there 

57
00:03:28,401 --> 00:03:33,401
are some serious clouds on the horizon,
a system addicted to debt.

58
00:03:37,220 --> 00:03:39,970
I'll be quick look at this chart which 
shows what happens.

59
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:42,100
Do you Chinese debt in the last few 
years?

60
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:48,220
As you can see,
it goes up and up and up,

61
00:03:48,221 --> 00:03:48,911
and I mean,
well,

62
00:03:48,911 --> 00:03:51,760
that's a seriously steep line on the 
other hands.

63
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:54,850
Look closely at what has happened is do 
Chinese economic growth.

64
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:58,030
As you can see.
Well this Charles,

65
00:03:58,031 --> 00:04:02,320
it's headed in the opposite direction,
so in other words,

66
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,790
in China the economy is declining and 
the debt wouldn't stop rising.

67
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:12,200
Look,

68
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:13,033
gross terms.
The Chinese debt as multiplying by four 

69
00:04:15,111 --> 00:04:16,520
since 2017.

70
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,363
Yeah,

71
00:04:18,030 --> 00:04:18,863
Chinese debt now equals more than 260 
percent of the GDP and many analysts 

72
00:04:22,441 --> 00:04:23,274
consider this number to be especially 
high for a country that has yet to 

73
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,640
become one of the richest in the world.

74
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:28,973
Well,
most of the debt is actually the 

75
00:04:29,491 --> 00:04:31,290
responsibility of Chinese company.

76
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:32,233
Yes.

77
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,760
Well,
the thing is that is a silver lining,

78
00:04:38,761 --> 00:04:42,440
but there is also a significant negative
side and that is an.

79
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:47,130
All this international expansion needs 
money and swell and the great deal of it

80
00:04:47,210 --> 00:04:48,043
as well.
Much of the debt has financed the 

81
00:04:49,141 --> 00:04:49,974
expansion of Chinese companies.
They have also paid well for this kind 

82
00:04:52,921 --> 00:04:53,754
of nonsense

83
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:55,783
throughout China.
There are hundreds of cities that have 

84
00:04:57,291 --> 00:05:00,020
almost everything one needs for modern 
urban lifestyle,

85
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,973
high rise apartment complexes,
developed waterfronts skyscrapers and 

86
00:05:03,981 --> 00:05:04,814
even public art.
Everything that is except one major 

87
00:05:07,461 --> 00:05:08,260
factor

88
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:09,093
people so you can get some idea of the 
size of all of it has been built in 

89
00:05:12,971 --> 00:05:14,620
China in the last few years.
Hey,

90
00:05:14,621 --> 00:05:17,620
attention to the following number.
In just three years,

91
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,483
China is used more concrete than the 
United States used in the entire 20th 

92
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:23,944
century and as I said,
everything absolutely everything has 

93
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,144
been paid for with debt.
So now we come to a really important 

94
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,283
question.
What the hell has happened in this 

95
00:05:33,611 --> 00:05:36,790
country to cause it to get into quite so
much debt,

96
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,213
trainees,

97
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:42,403
governments,
forward

98
00:05:42,430 --> 00:05:43,263
flight

99
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,533
the last few decades.
If you could say that Chinese people 

100
00:05:49,021 --> 00:05:52,320
were good at one thing,
well it would be saving money.

101
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:55,410
This is especially true if the oldest 
Chinese citizens,

102
00:05:55,411 --> 00:05:59,480
they work and they save ends weld.
That is pretty much all they do.

103
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:02,780
So thanks to all of that advert.
China has high investment rates,

104
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:05,840
but don't be fooled.
What has happened in the last few years,

105
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:06,674
it has nothing to do with this 
intelligence to know what has happened 

106
00:06:09,931 --> 00:06:12,710
is we need to go back to 2008 at that 
time,

107
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,370
all developed countries and we're going 
through a major financial crisis and you

108
00:06:16,371 --> 00:06:19,460
can probably imagine how this affected 
China's exports,

109
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,910
which are the engine that keeps driving 
China forward.

110
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:27,860
The truth is that at that time,
the Chinese government was terrifying,

111
00:06:27,861 --> 00:06:30,680
that the country would be affected by 
the national crisis,

112
00:06:30,681 --> 00:06:33,890
so in order to prevent it,
they came up with an idea.

113
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,783
The economic system had to be 
transformed and they had two beds on 

114
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:38,324
domestic demands.
When it comes through in the mouth of a 

115
00:06:40,281 --> 00:06:44,870
politician that's domestic demands thing
almost always means they are planning to

116
00:06:44,871 --> 00:06:48,810
start overspending and swelling.
That's exactly what Beijing did.

117
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:51,943
The Chinese government started a 
colossal program of extra public 

118
00:06:54,371 --> 00:06:55,204
spending of 4 trillion UN.
About $600,000,000,000 meant to be used 

119
00:06:58,421 --> 00:07:00,100
for building all kinds of 
infrastructure,

120
00:07:00,340 --> 00:07:02,380
high speed trains,
underground trains,

121
00:07:02,381 --> 00:07:03,400
highways,
houses,

122
00:07:03,401 --> 00:07:04,450
offices,
Cetera,

123
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:05,690
box.

124
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:06,523
They went further than that.
The Chinese government's thoughts and 

125
00:07:09,031 --> 00:07:11,060
that government overspending wasn't 
enough.

126
00:07:11,061 --> 00:07:13,850
So they had to encourage the companies 
to do the same.

127
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,800
So the question was how could they do 
that?

128
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:16,693
Well,
they decided to use a traditional 

129
00:07:18,141 --> 00:07:18,974
remedy,

130
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:21,163
2008,
trying to also started one of the most 

131
00:07:22,391 --> 00:07:23,224
expansive monetary policies ever known.
The authorities lowered interest rates 

132
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,590
and banks gave money loans to everyone 
who asks for them.

133
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,350
They practically establish an open bar 
of cheap lumps.

134
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:35,263
In three years.
The price of housing was an average of 

135
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:40,820
two point four times more expensive to 
an apartments which costs $100,000.

136
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:45,170
Three years before would now be worth 
$240,000.

137
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:47,200
What was the result of all of this?
Well,

138
00:07:47,210 --> 00:07:50,120
companies started to make all kinds of 
investments.

139
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:54,080
They build ghost towns bought our 
companies all over the world and engaged

140
00:07:54,081 --> 00:07:56,330
in all kinds of projects.
These are gone.

141
00:07:56,331 --> 00:07:57,164
Whatever crazy,
risky projects they felt like after all 

142
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:01,460
this central bank was pretty much giving
money away.

143
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:06,810
Reduction in key industries is damaging 
both China's economic sustainability and

144
00:08:06,811 --> 00:08:08,220
foreign trade relations.

145
00:08:08,770 --> 00:08:11,950
Obviously many of these projects have 
never been profitable,

146
00:08:11,951 --> 00:08:14,290
so the companies can't give the money 
back.

147
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:16,240
So what did they do that?
Well,

148
00:08:16,241 --> 00:08:20,790
they simply asked for new loans to pay 
back the old ones and the snowboard kept

149
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,633
rolling and it's getting bigger and 
bigger and this is how the Chinese 

150
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:29,350
economy became addicted to debt and now 
I've probably got an idea of what you're

151
00:08:29,351 --> 00:08:31,720
thinking.
Stupid private companies,

152
00:08:31,721 --> 00:08:32,710
right?
Well,

153
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,603
not exactly.

154
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:39,240
More than half of the bank debt in China
consists of loans from state owned banks

155
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:40,770
to state owned enterprises.

156
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,840
Wait just a second because there is so 
much more

157
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:50,700
Chinese banks,
a weapon of mass.

158
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:52,920
We've

159
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,990
already seen how China is currently 
going,

160
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:58,230
a debt overdose,
but as if this wasn't enough,

161
00:08:58,231 --> 00:09:03,200
there is another danger hiding in the 
bushes back in the shadows.

162
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,130
Banks face certain limitations on the 
amount of money they can loan,

163
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:08,993
but Chinese banks have managed to skip 
these controls and in a way these banks 

164
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,960
have just copied what American banks 
were doing with them.

165
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,610
Mortgages.
Let me explain.

166
00:09:18,090 --> 00:09:18,923
Instead of just giving loans,
they set up off balance companies that 

167
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:24,210
issued the debt that the banks then 
bought,

168
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,133
and these surprise surprise,
when you look at the banks accounts are 

169
00:09:27,241 --> 00:09:31,110
not listed as loans that are rather as 
other investments.

170
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:33,690
It's actually a pretty smart workaround,
right?

171
00:09:33,750 --> 00:09:34,800
Well,
it is estimated.

172
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:35,634
The Chinese banks have hidden woven 
$2,000,000,000,000 and it has a 

173
00:09:39,481 --> 00:09:40,314
straightforward consequence.
Chinese banks can be way less solvent 

174
00:09:43,650 --> 00:09:44,483
than their official numbers might 
indicate and besides much of this debt 

175
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,293
is opaque,
so the actual Chinese desk could be 

176
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:52,200
much,
much higher.

177
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,793
The vast spread of off balance 
activities and bank investment actually 

178
00:09:56,161 --> 00:09:59,760
means a risk of hidden loans which could
threaten China's financial security,

179
00:10:00,150 --> 00:10:02,310
shrunk fully in ex president of 
trainers,

180
00:10:02,311 --> 00:10:03,144
banking regulatory commission and 
weights because there's more a growing 

181
00:10:08,341 --> 00:10:09,174
number of non bank financial firms also 
market their own wealth management 

182
00:10:12,001 --> 00:10:12,834
products and invest the money with 
little disclosure of where the money 

183
00:10:15,301 --> 00:10:18,030
goes.
That's right in the last few years.

184
00:10:18,031 --> 00:10:18,864
Those companies at which get money from 
people to make investments that are 

185
00:10:21,841 --> 00:10:25,760
risky and as opaque as become more and 
more popular as well.

186
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:26,940
Why is that?
Well,

187
00:10:26,941 --> 00:10:27,774
it's obviously because they're going to 
get higher rates of return with those 

188
00:10:30,571 --> 00:10:33,480
investments.
The thing is that this craving for loans

189
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:34,343
has caused quite a bit of indigestion.
This is a risk that the government is 

190
00:10:37,261 --> 00:10:40,740
admitted and it has tried to limit 
company loans,

191
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,470
but since there are a lot of unsold 
ghost towns,

192
00:10:43,471 --> 00:10:46,320
empty houses and bankruptcy,
real estate agencies,

193
00:10:46,350 --> 00:10:47,183
the government has told the banks in the
last few years to give away loans as if 

194
00:10:50,521 --> 00:10:52,410
there was no tomorrow because,
well,

195
00:10:52,411 --> 00:10:53,244
the family debt level is still so low 
that economists note that China's 

196
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:58,613
mortgage loans increased by 35 percent 
in 2016 and now you might be beginning 

197
00:11:03,331 --> 00:11:07,860
to see why some analysts a warning that 
if they don't stop this debt vortex,

198
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,723
China could become a new Japan,
a country that has been in crisis since 

199
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:12,850
the 1980.

200
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,353
There is still more because now we know 
why she jinping and China need 

201
00:11:17,431 --> 00:11:18,264
globalization quite so much.
Air companies need foreign markets to 

202
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,910
deal with all of the debt that they have
issues.

203
00:11:25,900 --> 00:11:26,733
Boston,
not everything is all doom and gloom in 

204
00:11:28,611 --> 00:11:29,444
the future.
Well,

205
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:32,680
it's still to come in China.
The savings rates are still high,

206
00:11:32,710 --> 00:11:33,543
high enough,
the foreign capital to arrive in the 

207
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:35,884
country.

208
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:41,460
That's.
That is a risk and Moody's has given the

209
00:11:41,461 --> 00:11:43,950
first warning.
Now it's the time that the government to

210
00:11:43,951 --> 00:11:46,560
start working to make reforms,
and now,

211
00:11:46,561 --> 00:11:48,000
well,
we'd love to know your thoughts.

What do you think will happen in China?

214
00:11:54,490 --> 00:11:57,850
Do you think that stagnation?
We'll turn it into a new Japan or do you

215
00:11:57,851 --> 00:12:01,480
think there'll be new reforms which will
open China even more to the West?

216
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,343
