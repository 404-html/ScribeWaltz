1
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,790
Luxembourg is the only country in the 
world is prime minister is openly gay.

2
00:00:11,890 --> 00:00:13,860
We're talking about one of them is 
tolerance,

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:16,680
open-minded societies on the planet.
In fact,

4
00:00:16,690 --> 00:00:17,523
they have a population of around 500,000
inhabitants and 40 percent of them are 

5
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:21,510
immigrants.
In other words,

6
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:24,690
Luxembourg is the smallest country in 
the European Union,

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,840
but the one with the biggest share of 
immigrants nonetheless,

8
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:36,220
what made Luxenberg famous can be 
summarized in just one word.

9
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:38,560
And that word is money.
Yes.

10
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:39,394
Do you have.
You have the grants actually of 

11
00:00:40,061 --> 00:00:43,990
Luxembourg is one of the three 
wealthiest countries on earth here.

12
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,870
The minimum wage is around 2000 euros a 
month.

13
00:00:46,871 --> 00:00:48,190
No,
that's not average wage.

14
00:00:48,191 --> 00:00:51,490
That's the minimum wage.
The normal wage in Luxembourg.

15
00:00:51,610 --> 00:00:52,443
5,000 euros a month for comparison.
Luxembourgish people have a GDP per 

16
00:00:56,891 --> 00:01:00,810
capita twice as big as that of 
Australians or the dangers.

17
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:06,860
Alright.
Alright.

18
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:11,320
But just hold on for a second because 
that is a little trick in this figure.

19
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,183
You see almost half of the work is in 
this country actually live outside of 

20
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:16,834
it.
Everyday around 160,000 people commute 

21
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:19,834
to this country.
And then go back to their homes in 

22
00:01:21,461 --> 00:01:22,390
Germany,
France,

23
00:01:22,391 --> 00:01:23,710
or Belgium.
In other words,

24
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,680
they create wealth in the country,
but they don't live that.

25
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:30,460
This is why when we divide Luxembourg's 
GDB among their population,

26
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,130
we get such an enormous number,

27
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:39,893
even with these statistical deviations,
no one can deny that Luxembourg is kind 

28
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:48,000
of a country for many ins and this 
explains why it's capital.

29
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:48,863
Luxembourg city is among these cities in
the world with the highest quality of 

30
00:01:52,471 --> 00:01:53,304
life.
Many of you might think that this can 

31
00:01:54,541 --> 00:01:57,360
all be explained because Luxembourg is a
fiscal haven,

32
00:01:57,510 --> 00:01:58,343
but the truth is that other countries 
like Malaysia and Cyprus also have low 

33
00:02:01,231 --> 00:02:02,064
taxes,
but they are not even half as rich as 

34
00:02:03,961 --> 00:02:04,794
Luxembourg.
So the big question here is what does 

35
00:02:07,111 --> 00:02:10,530
Luxembourg happens that makes them so 
incredibly wealthy?

36
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:15,340
What did they do in this country to 
enjoy such a fantastic quality of life

37
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:20,360
life today?

38
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:22,323
Well,
we are going to answer that very 

39
00:02:23,461 --> 00:02:24,840
question,
but before we do,

40
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,050
let's take a look back at the history.
The kings of steel by the rag and 15,

41
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:38,450
the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg became an 
independent country.

42
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:39,373
And I say independence because none of 
its neighbors really recognized its 

43
00:02:42,621 --> 00:02:43,454
independence.
France and Germany used to be back then 

44
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:48,740
for for control over the dap sheet on 
several occasions.

45
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:55,563
In fact,
despite their government's desire for 

46
00:02:56,741 --> 00:02:59,340
independence,
the territory of Luxembourg was owned by

47
00:02:59,341 --> 00:03:01,270
King William the third of the 
Netherlands.

48
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,163
During these years,
Luxembourg was far from being a wealthy 

49
00:03:04,271 --> 00:03:05,104
country.
Most of its citizens survived thanks to 

50
00:03:06,521 --> 00:03:10,630
agriculture and iron mining back then,
one in every five people from Luxembourg

51
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:12,790
was emigrating to America.
Nonetheless,

52
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:13,624
living between two rival countries like 
France and Russia had its advantages 

53
00:03:16,511 --> 00:03:17,350
too.
You see,

54
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,110
during this time,
Germany didn't exist as a country.

55
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,120
Instead,
there were a lot of republics,

56
00:03:22,121 --> 00:03:25,210
kingdoms and Dutchies united under a 
confederation.

57
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:31,670
If you want to know what a confederation
is,

58
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:32,504
well click on this video.
The truth is all the German states 

59
00:03:34,911 --> 00:03:39,170
traded among themselves that basically 
created a special free trade zone,

60
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:40,590
which they called the silver,
right?

61
00:03:40,630 --> 00:03:42,460
All right,
so in 1942,

62
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,080
Luxembourg became a member of the 
zollverein.

63
00:03:45,170 --> 00:03:47,270
And since that point history,
what?

64
00:03:47,271 --> 00:03:49,400
It would never be the same again.
As I said before,

65
00:03:49,401 --> 00:03:52,160
poor Luxembourg was based on two main 
industries,

66
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,590
agriculture and iron mining,
and remember here,

67
00:03:54,591 --> 00:03:56,840
these are the times of the industrial 
revolution,

68
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:58,520
still was needed for,
well,

69
00:03:58,550 --> 00:03:59,383
basically everything.
It was used in everything from machines 

70
00:04:02,451 --> 00:04:07,040
to buildings and Luxembourgish citizens 
while they were sitting on top of a pile

71
00:04:07,041 --> 00:04:07,874
of iron,

72
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,113
but not only that,
we're talking about a tiny country 

73
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,690
placed in the intersection between 
France,

74
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:17,950
Germany,
and Belgium.

75
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:20,140
In other words,
it was the perfect points.

76
00:04:20,141 --> 00:04:24,070
Have a railroad so they could send the 
iron to all three countries.

77
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,790
All of a sudden,
Luxembourg became ground zero for all of

78
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:32,080
these trade routes as well as one of the
biggest steel providers on the planet.

79
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:33,213
In fact,
many of those New York skyscrapers were 

80
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:36,514
built with beams made in this country.
This is why the biggest steel companies 

81
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
are luxembourgish.
The biggest of them all.

82
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:48,173
Arcelor.
Mittal is one that you might have even 

83
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:54,150
heard about and financial newspapers,
and although as in just a few decades,

84
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,880
Luxembourg gone to the same level as its
neighbors,

85
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,690
but still it was not the economic dmf 
what it is today.

86
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,800
They still need to

87
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,270
special sauce.
That special sauce was this

88
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:09,313
29?
This is the year when Luxembourg past 

89
00:05:11,851 --> 00:05:12,684
the holding goal bonds.
Wait just a minute here because you 

90
00:05:15,361 --> 00:05:16,950
might be wondering,
well,

91
00:05:16,951 --> 00:05:19,230
what's corporate holding all about?
Well,

92
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:21,090
let's take a cookie cutter as an 
example.

93
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,090
On the one hand,
Coca Cola isn't beverage brand,

94
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:25,380
but on the other hand that is the Coca 
Cola company.

95
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:29,190
This is a big conglomerate that contains
other companies like Faenza Schweppes or

96
00:05:29,191 --> 00:05:30,650
Coca Cola,
the beverage brand.

97
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:35,740
Okay,

98
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:36,573
so this big conglomerates is called a 
holding corporation that owns the 

99
00:05:39,131 --> 00:05:39,964
company,
his insight it alcohol subsidiary 

100
00:05:41,261 --> 00:05:42,094
companies.
These subsidiaries can be in different 

101
00:05:43,781 --> 00:05:46,810
countries and all the guys who produce 
and distribute the drinks.

102
00:05:46,870 --> 00:05:47,703
However,
the role of the holding company is 

103
00:05:48,851 --> 00:05:52,480
mainly to manage the property of these 
other subsidiary companies.

104
00:05:52,530 --> 00:05:53,710
All right,
so this 19,

105
00:05:53,711 --> 00:05:54,544
29 law,
it's offered amazingly good tax 

106
00:05:56,501 --> 00:05:58,550
conditions to those holding companies.

107
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:01,100
Basically they paid around one percent

108
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,043
tap.

109
00:06:06,220 --> 00:06:07,053
These were the 19 thirties and back then
there wasn't as many holding companies 

110
00:06:09,761 --> 00:06:11,260
as there are today.
Johnson,

111
00:06:11,261 --> 00:06:12,094
remember,
those were the years when Coca Cola was 

112
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,130
starting to expand to other markets,
so Luxembourg was doing great,

113
00:06:18,131 --> 00:06:20,020
but they still want the drawing where 
they are today.

114
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:23,680
In other words,
Luxembourg was growing but not that much

115
00:06:23,681 --> 00:06:24,514
more than other countries.

116
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,900
Yes.

117
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,353
Nonetheless,
the seventies were other times when 

118
00:06:34,351 --> 00:06:35,184
American companies conquered the 
European and Asian markets that finally 

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,110
had some money to spend on consumer 
goods.

120
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:40,973
During these years,
many of the big corporations we know 

121
00:06:43,051 --> 00:06:44,460
today were born.
In other words,

122
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,353
a lot of holding sprang up and their 
profits came from all around the 

123
00:06:47,821 --> 00:06:49,920
planets.
So where did they decide to set up their

124
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:51,050
headquarters?
Well,

125
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,980
since they could choose anywhere they 
wanted to,

126
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,740
they went to the places with the best 
fiscal conditions.

127
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,040
Luxembourg has everything they want,
says a whole lot more.

128
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:01,500
You see,
by the 19 sixties and seventies,

129
00:07:01,650 --> 00:07:04,110
the country already had a big banking 
industry.

130
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:05,003
The best lawyers,
accountants and economists were living 

131
00:07:06,481 --> 00:07:07,314
there ready to help those big companies 
in order to take advantage of those 

132
00:07:10,531 --> 00:07:11,364
business friendly laws.
And this is how this little country 

133
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:15,710
glance into their silver decades.

134
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:23,383
Yes.
Do you believe what you see the economy 

135
00:07:24,531 --> 00:07:29,531
of Luxembourg became two times bigger in
less than six years compared to this.

136
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:32,750
China or Singapore is great rate.
It's kind of a joke and yes,

137
00:07:32,751 --> 00:07:35,150
you heard that right?
I did say before silver decade,

138
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,810
because all of this growth was nothing 
compared to what was to come.

139
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,973
Think about it.
We are already talking about the two 

140
00:07:41,790 --> 00:07:44,630
thousands,
the age of the online business.

141
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:45,464
Boom.
These brand new corporate juggernauts 

142
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,223
operated all over the world,
had dozens of subsidiary companies in 

143
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,634
every country are not concentrated in 
any specific location because they sold 

144
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:01,360
every year.
In other words,

145
00:08:01,851 --> 00:08:04,970
these tech companies were made some of 
Luxembourg,

146
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:05,953
so if you've got this country,
it was already astoundingly rich and 

147
00:08:07,761 --> 00:08:09,890
could have grown more well,
do you think?

148
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:11,013
Twice

149
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:21,873
amazing,
isn't it?

150
00:08:21,880 --> 00:08:23,950
I don't know if you noticed this,
but in just five years,

151
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,400
Luxembourg's GDP per capita,
I went from 50,000 US dollars,

152
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,234
which is already a lost over $100,000 
when you live in the country where the 

153
00:08:33,101 --> 00:08:35,560
GDP per capita of over $100,000

154
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:38,880
can fill the old swimming pool with 
champagne.

155
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:39,833
In fact,
the Audi a three is the third best 

156
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:42,354
selling car in

157
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:51,030
and yes.

158
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:51,863
Well,
they probably do know what you're 

159
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:54,390
thinking right now.
You think that this country has made its

160
00:08:54,391 --> 00:08:57,960
fortune by companies avoid paying taxes,
right?

161
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,040
Well beyond,
sir.

162
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:01,080
It's a little bit more complicated than 
that.

163
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:04,240
You see the facts that are holding 
corporation is located in Luxembourg,

164
00:09:04,241 --> 00:09:05,074
uh,
does not mean that its subsidiary 

165
00:09:05,761 --> 00:09:08,490
companies don't pay taxes elsewhere.
For instance,

166
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:10,440
Amazon has its headquarters in 
Luxembourg.

167
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,333
Nonetheless,
it's British subsidiary that is the 

168
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:13,404
company that sells products and managers
and logistics in this country still has 

169
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:20,190
to pay taxes in the UK,
or at least that is the theory.

170
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,033
In fact,
the reality is way different school lux 

171
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:28,260
leaks.
So let's get back to our Amazon example.

172
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,153
As we said,
the profits of his British subsidiary 

173
00:09:30,331 --> 00:09:32,340
are taxed in the UK rice.
Well,

174
00:09:32,341 --> 00:09:33,174
the question that then comes up is,
what if they don't have any profits 

175
00:09:35,671 --> 00:09:38,490
whatsoever?
Imagine that right after they pay taxes,

176
00:09:38,491 --> 00:09:39,324
Amazon UK gets a big loan,
a big loan with a really high interest 

177
00:09:42,241 --> 00:09:43,074
rates so high in fact,
that the company takes losses and who 

178
00:09:45,781 --> 00:09:46,980
lends them that money?
Exactly.

179
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:47,941
Well,
of course,

180
00:09:47,941 --> 00:09:49,890
that would be Amazon Holdings in 
Luxembourg.

181
00:09:49,950 --> 00:09:50,783
This weight,
these subsidiary companies have almost 

182
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:54,390
no profits.
One way or another,

183
00:09:54,391 --> 00:09:55,224
they managed to send them money to the 
Luxembourg brunch and that's what you 

184
00:09:57,921 --> 00:10:01,320
said before in Luxembourg.
Taxes are really low for companies.

185
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,300
Of course,

186
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,140
this is perfectly legal bus.
In 2009 during the financial crisis,

187
00:10:10,141 --> 00:10:10,974
the American governments realized the 
huge amounts of money they were losing 

188
00:10:13,201 --> 00:10:15,480
with all of these big companies moving 
overseas.

189
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:16,423
That's why today I'm announcing a set of
proposals to crack down on illegal 

190
00:10:19,791 --> 00:10:20,624
overseas tax evasion,
close loopholes and make it more 

191
00:10:24,081 --> 00:10:27,710
profitable for companies to create jobs 
here in the United States.

192
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:28,773
Since then,
other governments have also followed in 

193
00:10:30,341 --> 00:10:31,720
Obama's steps.
Now,

194
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:32,583
don't forget,
Luxembourg is one of the European 

195
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:35,860
Union's founding members.
His name is the other club.

196
00:10:35,861 --> 00:10:39,550
Members were angry and willing to lay on
a lot of political pressure,

197
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:43,150
but the biggest crisis for this country 
came in the year 2014.

198
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:44,163
This was the time when a group of 
accountants released a ton of private 

199
00:10:47,681 --> 00:10:49,090
data for these big corporations.

200
00:10:54,890 --> 00:10:55,440
Thanks

201
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,273
so called Lux leaks.
We could all see the tax evasion 

202
00:10:59,481 --> 00:11:02,840
strategies employed by thousands of 
different companies.

203
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:03,733
Now,
do you remember what I told you about 

204
00:11:04,071 --> 00:11:07,100
loans between different subsidiary 
companies within a holding.

205
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:08,083
Well,
here is another way of improving the 

206
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:12,110
deal.
You see all these big companies hire big

207
00:11:12,111 --> 00:11:12,944
consulting firms so they can help them 
with their accounting consulting firms 

208
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:20,240
like pricewaterhouse coopers with a big 
customer portfolio in Luxembourg.

209
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:23,090
That enough power to sit down with the 
prime minister back then,

210
00:11:23,091 --> 00:11:24,100
John Golan,
Jamaica,

211
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,230
and arrange a special tax deal.
No current spotlight after Luxembourg.

212
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,513
Tax Revelations,
the leaked documents demonstrate tax 

213
00:11:34,431 --> 00:11:37,880
arrangements negotiated by price 
waterhouse coopers.

214
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:38,803
As you could imagine,
the release of the luxleaks was a total 

215
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,930
game changer.
In fact,

216
00:11:41,931 --> 00:11:42,764
this year,
2017 Luxembourg past a brand's new 

217
00:11:45,441 --> 00:11:46,274
fiscal reform and probably many of these
arrangements are going to have to 

218
00:11:49,701 --> 00:11:50,534
change,
but hold on just a minute here because 

219
00:11:51,981 --> 00:11:55,120
this doesn't mean that is going to stop 
being a rich place.

220
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:56,950
In fact,
the opposite is probably true.

221
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:01,473
Despite this political turbulence,
the country group at a rate of four 

222
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:07,510
point two percent last year,
this is way faster than almost any other

223
00:12:07,511 --> 00:12:09,700
country in Europe having so many 
savings.

224
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,400
Luxembourg has invested in many other 
industries.

225
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,450
Now,
of course,

226
00:12:13,451 --> 00:12:14,284
they have steel.
They have their bank suddenly also have 

227
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,163
space.

228
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,233
Yes.

229
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,280
Burgs bent on space.
Industry shows early signs of success.

230
00:12:26,340 --> 00:12:27,330
Yep.
You heard that right?

231
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:28,164
In fact,
Luxembourg in the United States of the 

232
00:12:29,221 --> 00:12:32,280
first countries to pass laws regulating 
space mining,

233
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:33,263
and this tiny country is expected to 
become the Silicon Valley of the 

234
00:12:35,491 --> 00:12:38,670
aerospace industry.
This explains partly some of the details

235
00:12:38,671 --> 00:12:41,220
of the 2017 fiscal reform.
Of course,

236
00:12:41,221 --> 00:12:42,054
the government of Luxembourg doesn't 
want to help big corporations avoid 

237
00:12:44,010 --> 00:12:44,843
taxes.
At least this is what they say 

238
00:12:45,871 --> 00:12:46,920
officially.
Instead,

239
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:47,783
they have reduced taxes for smaller 
companies and are actively trying to 

240
00:12:50,341 --> 00:12:53,760
improve conditions in order to encourage
more tech startups.

241
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,100
But this is a subject for another video

242
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,830
question for you is do you think we're 
gonna?

243
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,440
See another moment of skyrocketing 
growth in Luxembourg economy.

244
00:13:06,620 --> 00:13:09,020
Well,
this country truly become a world leader

245
00:13:09,021 --> 00:13:10,610
in the aerospace industry.
