1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:11,860
With over $95 million inhabitants,
Egypt is the biggest country in the Arab

2
00:00:11,861 --> 00:00:16,080
wells and yes I know what you're 
thinking on Indonesia and Pakistan,

3
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:18,490
bigger than Egypt,
they Muslim to well,

4
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:19,660
yes,
they all live yet,

5
00:00:19,690 --> 00:00:20,523
but make no mistake,
there is a difference between Arab and 

6
00:00:22,930 --> 00:00:25,090
Muslim.
Islam is simply a religion.

7
00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:25,924
While Arabic is a culture or race and 
especially a language inside this Arab 

8
00:00:34,011 --> 00:00:34,844
world,
Egypt isn't only the most populous 

9
00:00:36,381 --> 00:00:38,660
country.
It's one of the most influential.

10
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,613
This is why the Arab League has its 
headquarters on the Taquerias Square in 

11
00:00:42,261 --> 00:00:45,680
the very center of Cairo.
And why news like this?

12
00:00:45,740 --> 00:00:50,740
It's like worrying.
Egypt rises to 300,

13
00:00:51,961 --> 00:00:54,600
five people in their deadliest terrorist
attack.

14
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:56,400
Nonetheless,
despite the latest news,

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:00:58,650
Egypt is changing faster than we might 
think,

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,633
maybe urine under the Arab spring in 
2011 thousands of people protested for 

17
00:01:03,301 --> 00:01:04,134
days to overthrow a Haas Niamh Uber Act.
The dictator who ruled the country back 

18
00:01:07,351 --> 00:01:09,910
then a year later,
the Muslim Brotherhood gains power ready

19
00:01:09,911 --> 00:01:12,510
to defend the country into the pyramids 
of an Islamic republic,

20
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:13,433
but now in 2017,
the Egyptian politics off taking a 180 

21
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,754
degree shift.
Gypsy government closes 27,000 mosques 

22
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:26,420
to fight terrorism.
So now the question becomes,

23
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,283
well,
how did we get here and Egypt of coming 

24
00:01:28,970 --> 00:01:29,803
a secular country.
While today we're going to answer those 

25
00:01:31,581 --> 00:01:32,870
questions,
but before we do,

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:34,670
let's take a look back at the history

27
00:01:37,310 --> 00:01:38,930
Muslim Brotherhood

28
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:42,950
that all three names here defined 
Egypt's history in the last 60 years.

29
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:44,900
NASA,
Sadat and Mubarak,

30
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:50,340
these three politicians have a common 
ingredients.

31
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:53,490
They will all dictators that fully the 
principles of Arab socialism.

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,800
This was the trend,
the ideology back then,

33
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:58,140
our cocktail that combined a centralized
economy,

34
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:02,790
authoritarian leadership and secularism 
must make a mistake because socialist as

35
00:02:02,791 --> 00:02:03,624
they claim to be,
none of these needles had any problem 

36
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:09,720
with changing their rubles into dollars.
As soon as the Soviet Union disappeared.

37
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:12,720
In fact,
Sadat recognize the state of Israel ends

38
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:16,380
during the 19 eighties.
Egypt was already an ally of America,

39
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:21,423
and as you know,
befriending America in this part of the 

40
00:02:22,751 --> 00:02:25,600
world puts you on the radical Islam,
the bullseye.

41
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:29,380
This is why Uber Mubarak prosecuted 
every Islamic movement.

42
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,273
Part of this repression was to avoid the
terrorist attacks that became pretty 

43
00:02:32,801 --> 00:02:36,880
frequent in the 19 nineties,
but uber and also had other motivations.

44
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:37,803
He wanted to stop any potential 
challenge to his authoritarian rule and 

45
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:41,794
guests.
You the only organized group here at 

46
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:45,760
replacing was well and yes,
that would be the Muslim Brotherhood.

47
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,880
Despite being a client destined movement
since 1954,

48
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:49,743
the Muslim Brotherhood is the most 
organized grassroots organization sense 

49
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:53,680
Egypt's independence

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:54,793
today,

51
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,953
thousands of members and millions of the
goal is to turn Egypt into an Islamic 

52
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:05,140
republic compliant with Sharia Law and 
the principles of the Koran.

53
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:06,273
Nonetheless,
the Muslim Brotherhood isn't the only 

54
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:08,854
radical group in this country.
Here we can also find the Salafist 

55
00:03:11,231 --> 00:03:13,720
superseded the same goals,
but by different means.

56
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:15,880
The guys you see on the screen now then 
was an brothers,

57
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:18,270
as you can see,
they dress in a very western fashion,

58
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,070
cities,
et cetera.

59
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,890
Now these other guys,
all the Salafist members,

60
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:29,310
do you see the difference?
Salafi have traditional Muslim clothes,

61
00:03:29,311 --> 00:03:30,144
beard sounds the every bar on their 
foreheads is created after hitting the 

62
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:34,890
ground so many times while praying to 
Mecca.

63
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,290
Okay?

64
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,130
As you can probably figure it out from 
the name,

65
00:03:41,131 --> 00:03:43,680
the Salafi is wanting to live long.
The first Muslims,

66
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:45,330
the Socorro,
Salafi did.

67
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,283
However,
the Muslim brothers are way more 

68
00:03:46,921 --> 00:03:49,110
pragmatic in better organized than 
members,

69
00:03:49,111 --> 00:03:49,944
infiltrate government institutions,
and they have no problem disclosing 

70
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:55,110
their intentions when they speak to the 
western media.

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:00,613
We are not terrorists.
The Muslim Brotherhood's philosophies 

72
00:04:02,691 --> 00:04:03,524
inspired by an understanding of Islam 
that emphasizes the values of social 

73
00:04:07,011 --> 00:04:08,330
justice,
equality,

74
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,770
and the rule of law God dot spokesperson
for the Muslim Brotherhood.

75
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,633
In other words,
both the salaries and the Muslim 

76
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:17,840
Brotherhood have the same goals,
but different strategies.

77
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,793
Today,
the salar fists have a political party 

78
00:04:20,211 --> 00:04:21,044
you called our nor,
and this has nothing to do with the 

79
00:04:23,031 --> 00:04:25,220
Muslim brothers.
As you can imagine.

80
00:04:25,221 --> 00:04:27,680
The radicals don't like each other very 
much.

81
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:28,553
Remember this,
because we will come back to it later 

82
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:32,060
anyway.
During the 19 eighties,

83
00:04:32,061 --> 00:04:35,900
the military dictatorship of Hosni 
Mubarak attacked both of these groups.

84
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,790
In fact,
since the year 1981,

85
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:38,743
Egypt has been in a neverending state of
emergency where every political 

86
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:43,610
dissident is sent to jail.

87
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:54,800
This means thousands of fists and Muslim
brothers spending decades behind bars,

88
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:55,823
and as you can imagine,
neither the European Union nor the 

89
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,770
United States did anything to stop this.
At the end of the day,

90
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:03,860
nobody wanted to see the Islamic 
radicals in the government.

91
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,290
If this was not enough,
after the young Kapoor,

92
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,740
warm Egypt had become a good ally of 
Israel and their economy,

93
00:05:09,790 --> 00:05:11,630
it was on fire.
Think about it.

94
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:15,710
This country has all the ingredients for
a world class tourism industry,

95
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,420
the Pyramids denial,
the desert,

96
00:05:17,421 --> 00:05:20,270
the Red Sea.
You can say that by the year 2000,

97
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,133
you couldn't label yourself a traveler 
if you didn't have an Egyptian stamp on 

98
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,124
your passport.
So for 30 years and had a free pass to 

99
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:30,230
rule Egypt that,
wait just a second,

100
00:05:30,290 --> 00:05:35,290
because in 2011 things really changed 
our signals,

101
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,933
Egypt succession by taking someone to 
Washington news only exist when made 

102
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:42,770
both the citizens and some factions of 
the army.

103
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,350
Equally enraged.
Having a dictator is one thing.

104
00:05:45,351 --> 00:05:48,410
Having a hereditary density of power is 
quite another.

105
00:05:48,650 --> 00:05:52,100
This is how the Arab spring canes,
Egypt's and why Mubarak out to resign,

106
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,620
a year later,
parliamentary ends.

107
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:54,463
Presidential elections were held.
We're talking about a country that has 

108
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,033
decades under a dictatorship where the 
only strong political movements other 

109
00:06:02,121 --> 00:06:05,480
than the government itself by the 
Salafis and the Muslim Brotherhood.

110
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,340
So I guess he won those elections.
Yes,

111
00:06:07,341 --> 00:06:10,490
it was the Muslim Brotherhood led by the
guy you see on the screen.

112
00:06:10,491 --> 00:06:11,460
Now,
Mohammed,

113
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:22,660
wait a minute because things are way 
more complex unless you are Saudi Arabia

114
00:06:22,661 --> 00:06:26,260
and you are sitting on a pile of soil.
Radical Islam isn't good for managing an

115
00:06:26,261 --> 00:06:27,094
economy.
So in less than one year Egypt's 

116
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,310
economy,
it absolutely sank.

117
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:33,540
Thousands of people lost their jobs and 
inflation skyrockets.

118
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:36,190
Meanwhile,
mostly his main goal was to Islam as the

119
00:06:36,191 --> 00:06:39,520
government stop the division of power 
and shield his own power.

120
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:41,040
Then you've got to add into this 
equation,

121
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:42,340
the army,
as we said before,

122
00:06:42,341 --> 00:06:45,640
Egyptian defense forces on new big fan 
of Islamist groups,

123
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:47,890
and this is how when you play,
I came into the picture,

124
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,880
Marshall,
Abigail,

125
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,700
fertile cc was the head of the Egyptian 
armed forces.

126
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:00,033
He met the leaders of the opposing 
parties including the Salafist and 

127
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:03,940
basically said something like,
okay,

128
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:05,290
so Doug Morris,
he and his friends,

129
00:07:05,291 --> 00:07:06,124
they're really screwing up.
The government's help me set to the 

130
00:07:07,401 --> 00:07:11,080
candidates are and we can put things 
back in order and as we say here,

131
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:13,050
a visual politic.
As it was said Sir,

132
00:07:13,051 --> 00:07:18,051
it was done land of the pharaohs.
By the year 2013,

133
00:07:19,391 --> 00:07:21,880
the Egyptian army kicked mostly out of 
the governments.

134
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:22,773
That's as policy was to make the Muslim 
Brotherhood and illegal organization 

135
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,320
again.
Of course,

136
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,153
protesters went to the streets and it's 
hundreds of them died and thousands of 

137
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:30,634
them were sent to jail.
But in June of 2014 new elections were 

138
00:07:34,301 --> 00:07:35,134
held,
and I say elections there because there 

139
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,594
was virtually a single candidate I'll cc
and he managed to get 97 percent of the 

140
00:07:41,801 --> 00:07:42,634
vote.

141
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:50,490
The other except candidate was a guy 
with a zero percent chance of winning,

142
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,324
called Habonim some bar heap.
He got the other three percent of the 

143
00:07:53,731 --> 00:07:54,960
vote.
So maybe you've seen the movie,

144
00:07:54,961 --> 00:07:56,490
the Dark Knight.
There's this amazing quote,

145
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:57,324
it says you either die a hero or you 
live long enough to see yourself become 

146
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:00,870
the villain.
Well,

147
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,990
this could have been coined by LCC 
himself.

148
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:05,790
In fact,
in the last few years,

149
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,653
Egypt has become the world's number one 
leader in people given the death 

150
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:11,370
penalty.
But not only that,

151
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:12,204
in just three years,
the government has closed over 27,000 

152
00:08:14,491 --> 00:08:15,324
mosques further.
There is no freedom of speech 

153
00:08:17,670 --> 00:08:22,670
whatsoever.
And yes,

154
00:08:24,921 --> 00:08:25,754
I know what you're thinking here.
The Islamic fanatics are pretty angry 

155
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:28,700
about this.
Well,

156
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:31,400
actually the opposite is true.
Do you remember how I said that?

157
00:08:31,401 --> 00:08:34,040
The Salafist and the Muslim Brothers 
aren't good friends?

158
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,470
Well,
I was definitely not kidding about that.

159
00:08:40,530 --> 00:08:43,250
You should ultra conservative Islam a 
back isis,

160
00:08:43,430 --> 00:08:44,263
seek to eclipse brotherhood bots.
Wait just a minute because things are 

161
00:08:46,761 --> 00:08:48,380
not good for the Salafist.
See them.

162
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,073
Of course lcc gave them enough so they 
could fill the roles left by the Muslim 

163
00:08:57,451 --> 00:08:59,430
brothers,
but those Egyptian believers,

164
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,264
he wanted to go to a mosque,
have to go to those controlled by the 

165
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:06,030
oil as hot emanates,
which is under government to control,

166
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,750
but you know what the biggest problem is
here that are less and less believers in

167
00:09:09,751 --> 00:09:10,584
Egypt.
The percentage of youngsters who pray 

168
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:14,130
daily has halved in less than $5.

169
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,633
Yes,

170
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:21,130
a barometer in the year,
2011,

171
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,430
84 percent of the population supported 
Sharia law influencing politics in 2016,

172
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,040
that percentage fell to 34 percent,
but not only that,

173
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:30,933
I'll cc himself,
celebrates the Christian Christmas in 

174
00:09:32,741 --> 00:09:35,230
the Coptic Cathedral of Kairos year 
after year.

175
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:37,150
In other words,
Egyptian society,

176
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:40,300
that's becoming more and more secular,
but before you get too excited,

177
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,690
wait just a moment because this could 
change at any moments.

178
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:47,110
First of all,
lccs popularity fell in 2017.

179
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,033
A good share of Egyptians do not like 
the fact that he gave Saudi Arabia 

180
00:09:50,291 --> 00:09:52,690
sovereignty over two islands in the red 
seat.

181
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,700
They also don't like the repression 
either.

182
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,750
In fact,
newsline,

183
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:56,613
this kind of resembles x time clair 
state of emergency after deadly church 

184
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:06,870
attacks on the other hands that your 
comedy is most Egyptians named worry.

185
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:08,880
Despite the unemployment rate's still 
going down,

186
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:12,360
it's still over 12 percent and these are
the official figures.

187
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:16,140
Some experts say that it might be over 
20 and displayed all of this.

188
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:21,170
The government is working on pharaoh 
like projects Egypt to build new capital

189
00:10:23,311 --> 00:10:26,220
paid for by China after this,
the terrorist attacks,

190
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,790
and we can only conclude the 
[inaudible].

191
00:10:27,930 --> 00:10:30,420
Governments is failing more than it is 
succeeding.

192
00:10:34,630 --> 00:10:35,463
So now the question is,
do you believe Egypt's can turn into a 

193
00:10:37,211 --> 00:10:39,160
secular country the way neighboring tune
is,

194
00:10:39,161 --> 00:10:42,310
he admits,
or do you think lccs governments is Deja

195
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:43,143
Vu of uber x and that eventually we will
see a brand new Arab spring in this 

196
00:10:46,331 --> 00:10:47,170
country?
