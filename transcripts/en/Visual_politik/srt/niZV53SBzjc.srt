1
00:00:07,450 --> 00:00:08,283
Brazil is the country of the future,
but it seems like we've been hearing 

2
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:13,720
that for a long time lately though.
We've had a lots of other countries,

3
00:00:13,721 --> 00:00:14,554
corruption scandals,
the economic crisis this is going 

4
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:19,370
through or the street violence in cities
like Rio de Janeiro bond.

5
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,670
There is something even more important 
about this country.

6
00:00:21,671 --> 00:00:23,860
Something that doesn't appear very much 
in the media.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,713
Yeah.

8
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,440
Brazil is the most expensive country in 
all of South America.

9
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:32,700
Yep.
You heard that,

10
00:00:32,701 --> 00:00:33,534
right?
If you go shopping in a city like Sao 

11
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,023
Paulo or Rio de Janeiro,
you'd better be ready to clean out your 

12
00:00:38,251 --> 00:00:42,330
wallet because it will be as expensive 
as New York or London.

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,070
The Brazilians even have a name for 
this.

14
00:00:44,071 --> 00:00:44,904
They call it customer Brazil.
This is the special charge you have to 

15
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:50,940
pay for living in the country of Samba.
So let's look at an example.

16
00:00:50,941 --> 00:00:53,340
The Big Mac Burger that you buy from 
Mcdonald's.

17
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:55,770
If you've been subscribed to visual 
politics for a long time,

18
00:00:55,771 --> 00:00:56,604
you already know that the economists use
something called the Big Mac index to 

19
00:01:00,210 --> 00:01:05,210
measure the cost of living in a country 
double in Switzerland.

20
00:01:06,291 --> 00:01:08,180
One of the wealthiest countries in the 
world,

21
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:11,210
the big Mac costs a whopping six point 
seven,

22
00:01:11,211 --> 00:01:13,270
$5.
Then we have Peru,

23
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:16,550
a poorer country where the Burger and 
costs $3 and twenty three cents.

24
00:01:16,610 --> 00:01:17,510
Fair enough,
right?

25
00:01:17,570 --> 00:01:18,590
Well,
in Brazil,

26
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:21,530
the big Mac,
it costs $5 and ten cents.

27
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:25,100
It's more expensive than in Denmark,
the UK or Canada,

28
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,470
according to the ex parte astound.com 
website.

29
00:01:27,471 --> 00:01:28,304
Sao Paulo is the most expensive city in 
South America with prices as high as 

30
00:01:32,031 --> 00:01:33,290
Houston,
Texas,

31
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:34,700
Berlin,
or Germany.

32
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:41,400
And now you might want to give them the 
high cost of living.

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,840
How high a Brazilian salaries,
all the wealthier save and Colombians.

34
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:47,100
Chileans.
Well,

35
00:01:47,101 --> 00:01:47,934
absolutely not.
The average wage in Brazil is less than 

36
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:51,264
$600 a month.
Argentinians and Chileans are actually 

37
00:01:53,701 --> 00:01:54,534
better off in this regard.
So the real question here is why is 

38
00:01:56,951 --> 00:01:57,784
Brazil so expensive?
One of the reasons why a middle income 

39
00:02:00,281 --> 00:02:03,220
country has the prices of a wealthy one.
Well,

40
00:02:03,221 --> 00:02:05,890
today we are going to answer this 
question and believe me,

41
00:02:05,891 --> 00:02:08,800
there's also partly explains the 
Brazilian crisis too.

42
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:13,260
So let's dive in.
Isolated economy.

43
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,320
Many of you might think of Brazil as a 
country opens a free trade,

44
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,101
right?
Well,

45
00:02:17,101 --> 00:02:17,934
at the end of the date,
many foreign companies like mastercard 

46
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:22,680
or Barclays have a strong presence in 
this country.

47
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:30,633
Nonetheless,
Brazil has the highest tariffs in South 

48
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:34,660
America.
So what does this mean?

49
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:35,523
Well,
imagine we have a cell phone 

50
00:02:36,911 --> 00:02:37,744
manufacturer in America or in,
they wanted to sell on the Brazilian 

51
00:02:40,301 --> 00:02:42,700
market.
Since our product is made abroad,

52
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,593
we must sell it with a special tax that 
could reach up to 35 percent of its 

53
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,850
market price.
As you can imagine,

54
00:02:48,851 --> 00:02:52,420
this type of policy has a pretty big 
impact on everyday life.

55
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:55,780
Contento

56
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:58,270
exits.
Brazilian market due to high tariffs.

57
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,800
Yes.
Heard that right.

58
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,300
During those years,
Brazilians,

59
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:02,134
he wanted to buy a we or an intended des
had to travel to Uruguay in order to 

60
00:03:05,921 --> 00:03:07,240
find one.
Interestingly,

61
00:03:07,241 --> 00:03:10,090
this was a great advantage for 
Nintendo's biggest rivals,

62
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,360
especially Microsoft and the Xbox,
and you know why?

63
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:14,343
Well,
Microsoft has a factory in Brazil where 

64
00:03:15,831 --> 00:03:16,664
the xbox one is made.
This means they don't have to import it 

65
00:03:19,330 --> 00:03:24,330
and therefore it doesn't have those high
tariffs and yes,

66
00:03:27,331 --> 00:03:28,164
I know what you're thinking.
High tariffs are cool because they 

67
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:33,780
forced companies to build factories in 
your country and employ your citizens.

68
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:34,920
Right?
Well,

69
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:38,760
think twice that when Microsoft opens 
that Brazilian factory,

70
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:39,713
they still need to import all the 
machines and materials needed to 

71
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:46,580
manufacture that xbox one.
This can be plastic semiconductors,

72
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:47,423
robots.
Many of these things are made somewhere 

73
00:03:49,141 --> 00:03:54,050
else and if they are made somewhere 
else,

74
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:54,913
they still have these special tariffs 
and you can guess who pays for these 

75
00:03:58,131 --> 00:03:59,420
extra costs.
Of course,

76
00:03:59,421 --> 00:04:00,254
it's the consumer.
This explains why so many products 

77
00:04:02,421 --> 00:04:04,730
manufactured in Brazil,
also expensive.

78
00:04:04,850 --> 00:04:07,940
Want an example?
Take the Volkswagen Golf in Mexico City.

79
00:04:07,941 --> 00:04:10,250
This car costs around 15,000 US dollars

80
00:04:13,410 --> 00:04:16,350
in Sao Paulo.
It costs 25,000 US dollars.

81
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:17,243
All of this,
despite the fact that this specific 

82
00:04:18,901 --> 00:04:21,930
model of automobile is many factored in 
Sao Paulo,

83
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:25,200
but wait a minute because this is not 
the only thing that explains this.

84
00:04:25,201 --> 00:04:26,034
Customer Brazil or what the Brazilians 
used to refer to this incredibly high 

85
00:04:28,711 --> 00:04:29,544
cost of living cousteau.
Let's imagine someone doing soy 

86
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:38,020
agriculture in the state of power in the
north of this country.

87
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,910
If he wants to send this side is all 
power,

88
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:42,190
he must carry it on trucks through the 
highway,

89
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:43,630
be all one six,
three.

90
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,290
This highway has over a thousand 
kilometers and a hundred of its on.

91
00:04:47,291 --> 00:04:48,124
Not even paved.
A simple rainy day is enough to keep 

92
00:04:50,081 --> 00:04:53,560
those trucks stuck in the mud,
and this is just one example.

93
00:04:53,650 --> 00:04:57,010
In fact in Brazil has some of the worst 
infrastructure in the world.

94
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:03,100
Even India has better roads,
so to make a comparison,

95
00:05:03,101 --> 00:05:05,830
any xymogen American farmer sells $100 
in,

96
00:05:05,831 --> 00:05:10,270
so he has to spend $9 on transportation.
The same farmer in Brazil,

97
00:05:10,410 --> 00:05:13,460
I'd have to pay $25 since they have no 
good roads.

98
00:05:13,461 --> 00:05:14,294
Brazilians have to invest in expensive 
trucks that break down quickly and make 

99
00:05:17,691 --> 00:05:18,524
the cost even more expensive.
And of course all of this means higher 

100
00:05:22,161 --> 00:05:25,010
and higher prices for Brazilian 
customers.

101
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,570
But now you might be wondering,
well,

102
00:05:26,571 --> 00:05:30,170
why is the Brazilian governments are 
reluctant to pay for infrastructure?

103
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,023
But at the end of the day,
Brazil has state of the art engineering 

104
00:05:32,661 --> 00:05:34,440
companies,
companies like the automatic.

105
00:05:34,480 --> 00:05:35,313
It's great.

106
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,890
He happened to be someone watching from 
a South American country.

107
00:05:42,891 --> 00:05:43,724
Well,
this name probably rings a bell for you 

108
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,890
or direct was the biggest engineering 
and construction company in the region,

109
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:49,963
and I do say was here because they had 
the biggest corruption scandal in the 

110
00:05:53,271 --> 00:05:54,104
history of the continent and as 
naturally with the future of the firm 

111
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,033
isn't looking pretty dim.
But this story does explain well why 

112
00:06:01,521 --> 00:06:04,610
Brazil has such poor infrastructure 
because at the end of the day,

113
00:06:04,820 --> 00:06:07,880
part of the money goes towards bribes 
and corruption.

114
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:08,953
But normally that's when the Brazilian 
government wanted to modernize their 

115
00:06:11,631 --> 00:06:13,160
country world.
What did they do?

116
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:16,350
Yeah,

117
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,383
well,
they decided to host the Olympic Games 

118
00:06:18,681 --> 00:06:20,530
and the FIFA World Cup.
So today,

119
00:06:20,540 --> 00:06:24,050
Brazilian cities can congratulate 
themselves for having the most beautiful

120
00:06:24,051 --> 00:06:28,070
sports arenas with high end technology 
and luxurious decoration today,

121
00:06:28,071 --> 00:06:29,690
taking a walk in the center of Sao 
Paolo,

122
00:06:29,691 --> 00:06:33,820
or it feels like being in a Scifi movie,
but outside of this metropolis,

123
00:06:33,821 --> 00:06:34,654
the railroads or abandons the highways 
are unpaved and several neighborhoods 

124
00:06:37,941 --> 00:06:41,840
don't have a single bus line that 
connects them with the city center.

125
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:48,270
Woeful infrastructure costs the economy 
as much as $48,

126
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:50,290
billion US dollars per year.
Now,

127
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:53,470
of course this affects the prices for 
Brazilian consumers,

128
00:06:53,530 --> 00:06:57,340
but also for worldwide consumers who 
wants to buy and Brazilian goods.

129
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,203
But that is something we're actually 
going to address in a future video 

130
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,203
because now the question really becomes 
how can someone who makes $600 bucks a 

131
00:07:03,641 --> 00:07:08,140
month spend 25 bucks on pizza as an 
average restaurant in Sao Paolo?

132
00:07:08,230 --> 00:07:10,270
Well,
I am going to tell you how

133
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,270
ready

134
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,630
the hallway for decades,
Brazil had some of the highest inflation

135
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,090
in the wells during the 19 eighties and 
nineties,

136
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:24,630
they had more than 6,000 percent 
inflation.

137
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:28,250
This means if you had a bear as a Rio de
Janeiro bar in 1980,

138
00:07:28,260 --> 00:07:29,093
you would pay 100 femoral.
The terra was the Brazilian currency 

139
00:07:31,771 --> 00:07:33,000
back.
Then one year later,

140
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:36,280
that same beer would cost 600,000 
arrows.

141
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:37,463
As you can imagine,
hyperinflation created unique consumer 

142
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:40,734
behavior

143
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:44,910
behavior

144
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:48,040
that was quite different from the rest 
of the world in order to survive.

145
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,893
Resilience,
ships got used to selling with 

146
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:53,010
installments and it's.
This is still a thing today.

147
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:56,470
If you go to any Brazilian shop,
you can see that next to the prices said

148
00:07:56,471 --> 00:07:59,400
something like 10 x,
12 x or 20 x.

149
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,390
This number means that you can pay for 
this product on 10,

150
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,020
12 or 20 installments.

151
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,600
In other words,

152
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,760
question many Brazilians ask themselves 
is not whether this TV,

153
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:14,700
your this suit is more or less 
expensive,

154
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:17,850
but if they can pay for it during the 
next two years,

155
00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:20,820
and as you can imagine when you buy 
something in installments,

156
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:25,880
it is far more extensive.
On the screen,

157
00:08:26,901 --> 00:08:30,260
we're showing you a smartphone on a 
Brazilian ecommerce website.

158
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,790
If you bought a ones,
it costs 632 you race,

159
00:08:32,791 --> 00:08:35,420
which is equivalent to $202 at the 
moment.

160
00:08:35,421 --> 00:08:38,330
We need this video nonetheless.
If you buy it with installments,

161
00:08:38,331 --> 00:08:42,860
it costs 217 US dollars,
which is a seven percent increase.

162
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:43,753
So as you can imagine,
your average Brazilian is in debt all 

163
00:08:46,161 --> 00:08:46,994
the time.
Ninety percent of Brazilians in 

164
00:08:50,891 --> 00:08:51,630
installment

165
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:54,210
debt,
but

166
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:55,980
wait just a minute because is not the

167
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,410
worst of it.
In the last year,

168
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,283
something has happened in Brazil that is
done to custody Brazil into a real nice 

169
00:09:01,381 --> 00:09:04,650
matt ready

170
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:05,483
card.
How at the beginning of the two 

171
00:09:06,710 --> 00:09:07,620
thousands,
Brazil,

172
00:09:07,621 --> 00:09:09,870
it was the perfect market for foreign 
banks.

173
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,763
Big Financial firms like Santander or 
credit suisse started investing in the 

174
00:09:14,071 --> 00:09:17,340
country.
And don't forget,

175
00:09:17,341 --> 00:09:20,580
we're talking about a $200 million 
person country that was on the rise here

176
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,563
where prices were high and people are 
used to paying for things in 

177
00:09:23,461 --> 00:09:25,470
installments and other words.
Brazil.

178
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:26,304
It was a paradise for selling credit 
cards since 2005 Brazil's credit card 

179
00:09:30,841 --> 00:09:33,380
market has grown at a 20 percent plus 
rate and yeah.

180
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,863
Yep,

181
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,653
yeah,
2012 Brazilians had an average of two 

182
00:09:42,131 --> 00:09:45,820
credit cards per person and they really 
knew how to use them.

183
00:09:46,030 --> 00:09:46,863
Brazil was the country with the most 
credit payments across all of South 

184
00:09:49,450 --> 00:09:50,500
America.
Nonetheless,

185
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,393
that happiness,
it didn't last very super default and 

186
00:09:56,641 --> 00:10:00,760
credit cards has reached 27 percent in 
April 2012 in the very same year,

187
00:10:00,790 --> 00:10:01,623
2012,
the alarm started to sound in all those 

188
00:10:03,491 --> 00:10:04,324
Brazilian banks.
The country was in the middle of a 

189
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:10,000
crisis with rising unemployment and 
declining salaries and that made it hard

190
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:12,190
for Brazilians.
Do pay back that debt.

191
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:15,050
So what happens when a bank is afraid of
getting into falses?

192
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:16,830
Well,
as the interest,

193
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,673
great

194
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:24,050
residents have to pay 414 percent 
interest on their credit cards.

195
00:10:24,430 --> 00:10:26,710
So you mentioned you use your credit 
card to buy a TV screen.

196
00:10:26,711 --> 00:10:30,220
The costs you a thousand US dollars,
you pay for it in 12 installments.

197
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,390
Well,
at the end of the day,

198
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:33,310
counting the interest rates and the 
credit card,

199
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,930
the TV costs around 5,000 US dollars.
Pretty impressive,

200
00:10:37,931 --> 00:10:38,764
isn't it?
And don't forget that the average wage 

201
00:10:39,971 --> 00:10:42,940
in present is less than $600 a month.
In other words,

202
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,640
no matter the antipoverty measures taken
by the government,

203
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:48,940
most Brazilians struggling to survive 
and west of all,

204
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,290
since they call it,
saves money,

205
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:53,020
losing a job and be a real tragedy for 
many,

206
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,000
almost

207
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,660
relation in Rio de Janeiro increases 150
percent in three years.

208
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,553
Yes.

209
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,010
Yeah.
Is the question now,

210
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,873
can Brazil get over the situation?
Who could possibly reformed this 

211
00:11:08,941 --> 00:11:09,631
country?
