1
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:10,193
North Korea is perhaps the most emetic 
closed off and isolated country on the 

2
00:00:13,141 --> 00:00:13,974
planet.
I can you that now in 2018 it seems to 

3
00:00:16,021 --> 00:00:17,760
be living in 1960

4
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:25,293
hello

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,153
the now this entire store,
it might be about to change here and 

6
00:00:30,321 --> 00:00:31,154
there's your politic.
We've already talked about how 

7
00:00:32,481 --> 00:00:36,350
capitalism is reaching North Korea by 
following popular markets.

8
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,213
How can entire entrepreneurial 
revolution is taking place and how 

9
00:00:39,921 --> 00:00:40,754
today,
well then at 50% of North Koreans to 

10
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,720
make a living from the private economy.
However,

11
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:46,940
a couple of questions remains on the 
table.

12
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:47,803
What does one of the most totalitarian 
governments on the planet think about 

13
00:00:50,241 --> 00:00:54,620
this particular capitalist revolution?
What are his plans and other very,

14
00:00:54,621 --> 00:00:55,454
very important question.
Who the hell would be willing to invest 

15
00:00:57,980 --> 00:00:59,000
in North Korea?
Well,

16
00:00:59,001 --> 00:00:59,834
listen up.

17
00:01:05,740 --> 00:01:06,573
Okay.

18
00:01:08,380 --> 00:01:10,100
Views aren't the best of times.

19
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,323
On June the 12th 2018 historic in 
meeting was held in Singapore for the 

20
00:01:16,721 --> 00:01:18,790
first time.
TheU s presidents in this case,

21
00:01:18,791 --> 00:01:23,791
Donald Trump mess within North Korea.
Why?

22
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:27,543
Well,
supposedly this was to d nuclearized 

23
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:29,960
North Korea.

24
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,793
Yeah.

25
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:37,630
The actual goal.
Well in addition seem taking a couple of

26
00:01:37,631 --> 00:01:38,290
pictures.
I mean,

27
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,123
hey,
pictures never hurts because the idea 

28
00:01:40,061 --> 00:01:40,894
was to start a dialogue and cool down 
the enormous tension that had been 

29
00:01:43,301 --> 00:01:44,134
growing between the two countries and 
for North Korea from continuing with a 

30
00:01:46,811 --> 00:01:47,644
nuclear program that could have given it
the ability to attack even the United 

31
00:01:50,590 --> 00:01:51,760
States.
Well hold on a minute because you know,

32
00:01:51,761 --> 00:01:54,130
one the things theory and another thing 
is truth.

33
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,750
I mean,
check out the latest news.

34
00:01:57,260 --> 00:01:57,450
Okay.

35
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,283
West spy agencies,
North Korea is now working on new 

36
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:06,111
missile secretary of state.
Mike Palm Peo acknowledged during Senate

37
00:02:06,461 --> 00:02:11,461
testimony that North Korea factories 
continue to produce facade material used

38
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:12,820
in making nuclear weapons.

39
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,910
And nowadays as we told you,
you hear on visual politic,

40
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,773
it seems very difficult for the 
Pyongyang regime to agree at least in 

41
00:02:24,301 --> 00:02:26,520
the short term,
to get rid of its nuclear weapons,

42
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:29,190
which are after all of that best life 
insurance.

43
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,053
But of course that doesn't mean they 
won't accept to making concessions to 

44
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:32,693
normalize their relations with the rest 
of the welds and ends the international 

45
00:02:35,341 --> 00:02:36,174
sanctions.
Because you see since Kim Jong Un came 

46
00:02:37,561 --> 00:02:38,394
to power in 2011 he said two priorities 
on the one hand develop a nuclear bomb 

47
00:02:42,211 --> 00:02:45,480
and on the other something far less 
sinister reforming the economy.

48
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:48,120
Yes,
you heard that right.

49
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:48,983
Although it seems hard to believe one of
the objectives that Kim Jong own vet 

50
00:02:51,451 --> 00:02:52,284
North Korean dictator has set himself is
to change his country's bad economic 

51
00:02:55,231 --> 00:02:56,064
situation by copying or some of the 
changes that have taken place in 

52
00:02:58,411 --> 00:03:03,310
countries like China and Vietnam this 
out.

53
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,193
Once they develop their nuclear 
capabilities Pyongyang's number one 

54
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:10,690
priority is precisely this to advance in
economic development.

55
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:11,613
Of course to achieve this they need to 
end international sanctions which are 

56
00:03:14,711 --> 00:03:16,630
causing enormous damage.
Yes,

57
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:17,464
we'll see how that,
it may seem hard to believe North Korea 

58
00:03:19,001 --> 00:03:21,400
situation could get even worse.
For example,

59
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:23,710
between the sanctions and the sinking of
Venezuela,

60
00:03:23,711 --> 00:03:24,544
one of the few countries that had 
aligned itself with North Korea 

61
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,180
relations.
You have collapsed,

62
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:38,080
but of course when we talk about North 
Korea in the economy,

63
00:03:38,081 --> 00:03:38,914
we need to talk about China.
80% of all North Korean trade and 

64
00:03:41,471 --> 00:03:42,304
foreign exchange occurs here and once 
that happened is that China has been 

65
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:49,750
pushing Pyongyang for years to get some 
reforms going once and for all.

66
00:03:49,780 --> 00:03:53,010
And since those changes have been slower
than a total with rheumatism,

67
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,890
well last year Beijing decided to start 
applying international sanctions.

68
00:03:56,950 --> 00:03:57,783
This is what was happening in August of 
2017 China to implement UN sanctions on 

69
00:04:03,491 --> 00:04:08,491
North Korea trying to band North Korean 
iron lead and coal imports as part of UN

70
00:04:09,161 --> 00:04:10,660
sanctions.
As you can imagine,

71
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:14,140
considering the enormous dependence that
North Korea has on China,

72
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:15,033
this has been a disaster.
Just in the first six months of 2018 

73
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:24,970
Chinese purchases of North Korean 
products have plummeted by more than 90%

74
00:04:24,971 --> 00:04:29,971
of Chinese exports to North Korea by 40%
this of course is in the official market

75
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:34,740
and as we've seen,
there is a parallel market,

76
00:04:34,810 --> 00:04:37,400
the black market,
and that's an entirely different story.

77
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:40,363
The fact is that all this has led North 
Korea and industrial and mining 

78
00:04:42,891 --> 00:04:43,724
production to go through its worst time 
in recent years as if we had the 

79
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:49,424
disastrous state of the country's 
infrastructure to all of this with our 

80
00:04:52,171 --> 00:04:55,220
continuous black,
less than a thousand kilometers of paved

81
00:04:55,221 --> 00:04:56,870
roads throughout the country and to get 
to crap.

82
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:57,713
It trains that in many cases,
don't go over 20 kilometers or 12 miles 

83
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,184
per hour.
It's clear that this country urgently 

84
00:05:02,631 --> 00:05:05,630
needs a 180 degree turn,
and you know what's,

85
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,190
they also know that in Pyongyang.

86
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,273
Okay,

87
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:17,320
Ken,
North Korea become the new Vietnam.

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:22,860
In 1986 Vietnam launched the well known 
Dorothy Moye policy,

89
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:26,830
a set of economic reforms similar to 
those of den Shao Ping and China.

90
00:05:26,890 --> 00:05:28,940
These had the mission of setting 
communism aside.

91
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,050
In order to jumpstart a market economy 
to achieve this,

92
00:05:34,241 --> 00:05:36,460
agricultural cooperatives were 
dissolved.

93
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,310
Price controls were eliminated,
land ownership was allowed,

94
00:05:39,311 --> 00:05:42,130
and policies were put in place to 
attract foreign investment.

95
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,400
So what was the result of all of this?
While over the following 30 years,

96
00:05:45,401 --> 00:05:49,810
Vietnam economy grew at an average 
annual rate of almost 7% today,

97
00:05:49,811 --> 00:05:50,644
Vietnam is transforming at a break,
neck speed and its exports are or any 

98
00:05:53,771 --> 00:05:56,620
larger than those of countries like 
Brazil or Australia.

99
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:05,750
Well,

100
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
at the last into Korean summit in April 
between Kim Jong Un's the president of 

101
00:06:09,861 --> 00:06:10,694
South Korea Moon Gin,
the North Korean leader expressed an 

102
00:06:13,071 --> 00:06:16,460
interest in following the model of 
Vietnam and following this line,

103
00:06:16,461 --> 00:06:17,294
the North Korean government has approved
some significant measures in recent 

104
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,021
years,
for example,

105
00:06:21,021 --> 00:06:21,854
and it has promoted the creation of 
private markets has given more autonomy 

106
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,430
to public companies.
It does granted land parcels to peasants

107
00:06:28,431 --> 00:06:30,140
for private exploitation.
However,

108
00:06:30,141 --> 00:06:33,110
despite all of this,
there are two questions which we need to

109
00:06:33,111 --> 00:06:33,921
answer.
He won't.

110
00:06:33,921 --> 00:06:34,754
Earth would be willing to invest in 
North Korea and what else is the 

111
00:06:36,951 --> 00:06:39,500
Pyongyang government willing to do?
I'll listen up.

112
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:48,603
Would invest in North Korea.
If you were asked which countries you 

113
00:06:52,931 --> 00:06:53,764
would like to do business in,
North Korea would probably be one of 

114
00:06:55,991 --> 00:06:56,824
your last options.
Investing in such a totalitarian comes 

115
00:06:59,061 --> 00:07:01,030
from where the leader makes and unmixed 
laws.

116
00:07:01,031 --> 00:07:01,864
At will where the government Daggett's 
with brutality and dedicates itself to 

117
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,540
threatening the rest of the planet.
Investing in a country where the rule of

118
00:07:07,541 --> 00:07:10,150
law and legal security is pure fantasy.
I mean,

119
00:07:10,151 --> 00:07:10,984
come on while folks,
the truth is they're not everyone sees 

120
00:07:12,971 --> 00:07:13,804
it this way.

121
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:16,870
Okay.

122
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:17,703
See some of South Korea is the largest 
company is such as high on dye lot 

123
00:07:19,891 --> 00:07:20,724
cooperation and Samsung have already set
up work groups to investigate and 

124
00:07:24,061 --> 00:07:24,894
analyze the potential business 
opportunities in North Korea and 

125
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:29,910
according to polls,
three quarters of South Korean companies

126
00:07:29,911 --> 00:07:30,744
would be willing to do business in North
Korea if sanctions were lifted high on 

127
00:07:33,931 --> 00:07:34,711
day,
for example,

128
00:07:34,711 --> 00:07:35,544
is already preparing an early reopening 
of the industrial case on zone and 

129
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:40,830
industrial saying next to the border of 
South Korea.

130
00:07:40,831 --> 00:07:43,710
That was created in 2004 to how's 
foreign companies,

131
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,560
mainly South Korea,
which employs more than 80,000

132
00:07:46,561 --> 00:07:47,394
North Koreans.
But in 2013 given the growing tensions 

133
00:07:49,891 --> 00:07:50,724
between the two careers,
it was closed by the Pyongyang 

134
00:07:52,441 --> 00:07:56,370
government.
Even recently,

135
00:07:56,371 --> 00:07:58,740
Jim Rogers,
one of the most important and well known

136
00:07:58,741 --> 00:07:59,574
investors of all time has lamented the 
fact that the United States doesn't 

137
00:08:02,611 --> 00:08:06,330
allow him to invest in North Korea and 
just made statements such as these

138
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,470
Korea is now going to be the most 
exciting country in the world.

139
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,580
Kim Jong Goon does not want war.
Kim is not North Korean.

140
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:15,443
He was educated in Switzerland.
He knows there's a different world out 

141
00:08:17,791 --> 00:08:19,770
there.
They need everything electricity,

142
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:22,980
so tablecloths,
if you've got any kind of expertise,

143
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,530
you're going to make a fortune.
Jim Rogers,

144
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:26,523
but the holy Roman just amendment.
The question we have to ask ourselves 

145
00:08:28,811 --> 00:08:29,171
is,
well,

146
00:08:29,171 --> 00:08:32,140
what the hell do they see in a country 
like North Korea?

147
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,210
Well,
fundamentally they see opportunities.

148
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,710
North Korea has a very young,
and it's very entrepreneurial population

149
00:08:41,711 --> 00:08:43,780
with low labor costs.
In addition,

150
00:08:43,781 --> 00:08:44,614
the country,
it seems to be quite rich and net for 

151
00:08:45,731 --> 00:08:46,840
resources.
It's got gold,

152
00:08:46,841 --> 00:08:47,561
zinc,
copper,

153
00:08:47,561 --> 00:08:48,394
and rare earth elements.
The estimate of value of all of these 

154
00:08:50,111 --> 00:08:55,111
minerals could be more than $6 billion.
As Jim Rogers says,

155
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:01,170
the country is still being built.
It needs everything.

156
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,093
And if that wasn't enough.
It's also located between two economic 

157
00:09:04,381 --> 00:09:06,060
powers,
China and South Korea.

158
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:09,630
You see it the last Inter Korean summit,
it's the South Korean president gave Kim

159
00:09:09,630 --> 00:09:13,200
Jong a pen drive that included lots of 
the investments that South Korea we'd be

160
00:09:13,201 --> 00:09:14,034
willing to.
Yeah.

161
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,670
Do you know what investments would be 
included on this 10 drive?

162
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:19,533
Well sold.
We'll be very interested in building 

163
00:09:20,561 --> 00:09:21,394
trends,
Korean railroads that in addition to 

164
00:09:22,571 --> 00:09:23,404
boosting the North Korean economy would 
allow South Korea to export goods much 

165
00:09:26,291 --> 00:09:28,900
more quickly to China.
And it's the same story with roads,

166
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:30,100
all pipelines,
et cetera.

167
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:30,963
These would be billion dollar plans.
Of course not everything is so simple 

168
00:09:36,881 --> 00:09:41,800
and enthusiasm is far from widespread.
North Korea is a brutal dictatorship.

169
00:09:41,801 --> 00:09:45,340
Corruption is huge and the government 
can do literally whatever it wants.

170
00:09:45,370 --> 00:09:47,040
For example,
it can expropriate.

171
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,470
[inaudible]

172
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,853
is where the money is to be made.
If you can figure out how to not get 

173
00:10:00,251 --> 00:10:01,084
expropriated,
Justin Hastings and associate professor 

174
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:04,840
at the University of Sydney,

175
00:10:04,930 --> 00:10:09,100
and then of course there's the issue of 
international sanctions as a consequence

176
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:12,280
of their nuclear program and until those
are lifted any change,

177
00:10:12,310 --> 00:10:13,143
it's going to have a very short run.
Now it's precisely at this point that 

178
00:10:15,431 --> 00:10:17,560
China can play a very important role.
You See,

179
00:10:17,610 --> 00:10:21,310
Xi Jinping has managed to do what 
China's been planning for years,

180
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:22,173
getting Qian Yang going,
which could obviously mean a lot of big 

181
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:25,114
business with Chinese companies.
That's why we now see headlines like 

182
00:10:27,731 --> 00:10:28,564
this.

183
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,250
China suggests sanctions relief for 
North Korea after trump Kim summit,

184
00:10:34,410 --> 00:10:35,243
and not only that,
China has allowed the black markets 

185
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,463
between both countries to flourish.
It's accelerated the development plans 

186
00:10:40,291 --> 00:10:43,920
in the border area and is already 
studying the eminence opening of special

187
00:10:43,921 --> 00:10:46,830
economic zones on the North Korean 
border and then there's tourism,

188
00:10:46,831 --> 00:10:48,720
which is one of Kim Jong Un's 
governments.

189
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:50,340
Greatest priorities.
Listen Up,

190
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:56,980
right?

191
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:57,813
Korea.
A holiday spot was the arrival of 

192
00:11:01,081 --> 00:11:04,860
Chinese tourists has continued in recent
years and since May,

193
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,990
2018 the number of daily arrivals is 
more than doubled.

194
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:08,803
You're going to run at least seven or 
eight tour routes to North Korea this 

195
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:12,703
year,
including a one day tour to nano and a 

196
00:11:14,811 --> 00:11:19,811
trip of four to five days to Pyongyang.
K Song and Pawn Joan changing it.

197
00:11:20,151 --> 00:11:22,850
Deputy manager of a Chinese travel 
company.

198
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,773
Well,
tourism is precisely one of the 

199
00:11:24,681 --> 00:11:27,740
Pyongyang government's top priorities 
for several reasons.

200
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:29,420
First,
it generates employment.

201
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,060
Remember,
this is a very labor intensive Saxa.

202
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:35,660
It also attracts investments that helps 
obtain foreign currency very quick.

203
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:40,290
Okay.
On the other

204
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:41,123
hand,
tourism could change the regimes image 

205
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:43,793
and the truth is that swapping nuclear 
parades and nuclear threats with exotic 

206
00:11:46,591 --> 00:11:49,290
beaches and seaside dinners,
it's going to be good for business.

207
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,153
Do you do this?
In 2014 the Korean government created 

208
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:52,704
these special tourist of one son,
a special economic zone where foreign 

209
00:11:55,601 --> 00:11:56,434
investment is allowed and where in 
principle the regime would allow more 

210
00:11:58,871 --> 00:12:00,880
freedom for developing tourism.
Yes,

211
00:12:00,881 --> 00:12:05,320
this is the same area where until 
recently the army did things like this.

212
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:06,213
You know,
North Korea and things is that with the 

213
00:12:20,911 --> 00:12:24,240
nuclear program and the sanctions 
results have been very scarce.

214
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:25,260
However,
Kim Jong Un,

215
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:27,690
he wants to step on the gas without 
going any further.

216
00:12:27,691 --> 00:12:31,020
In 2017 the North Korean governments and
to delegation to Spain,

217
00:12:31,021 --> 00:12:31,854
which is one of the major tourist powers
of the world in order to check out 

218
00:12:34,231 --> 00:12:36,540
places and like panadol more marina 
d'or.

219
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:39,900
The idea was that this delegation would 
learn from them and get some ideas.

220
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:46,840
Apparently Pyongyang's goal is to 
attract more than 1 million tourists per

221
00:12:46,841 --> 00:12:50,440
year in the short term and five to 10 
million more in the foreseeable future.

222
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:53,590
The question is,
will Kim Jong really be willing to carry

223
00:12:53,591 --> 00:12:54,424
out all of the reforms that the country 
needs to get these plans to come to 

224
00:12:57,281 --> 00:12:58,001
life?
Well,

225
00:12:58,001 --> 00:12:58,834
folks,
only the future going to be able to 

226
00:12:59,741 --> 00:13:00,574
answer that question for now.
What seems clear is that we have the 

227
00:13:02,081 --> 00:13:05,110
best opportunity to leave the North 
Korean nightmare behind,

228
00:13:05,111 --> 00:13:07,690
which isn't only a threat to the rest of
the world's best.

229
00:13:07,691 --> 00:13:08,524
Above all,
it's a punishments and to great prison 

230
00:13:10,091 --> 00:13:12,790
of fear and repression for the North 
Koreans themselves.

231
00:13:12,820 --> 00:13:13,653
But now it's your turn.
Are you in favor of lifting sanctions 

232
00:13:15,851 --> 00:13:16,684
against North Korea?
