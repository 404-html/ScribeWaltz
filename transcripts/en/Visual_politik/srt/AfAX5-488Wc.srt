1
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:09,923
Isn't her douse the trade war is one of 
the hottest topics in international 

2
00:00:12,681 --> 00:00:13,580
politics,
payroll,

3
00:00:13,581 --> 00:00:14,181
visual,
politic.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:15,014
We've already spoken about the 
consequences that this trade wall may 

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,520
have,
which may already be having.

6
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:23,000
However we should explore requestion.
Many of you have already asked,

7
00:00:23,030 --> 00:00:23,863
especially through our patrion page,
which is essential for analyzing this 

8
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:28,033
entire matter.
Why does the United States have some 

9
00:00:30,341 --> 00:00:32,120
shot at launch?
Trade deficits,

10
00:00:32,150 --> 00:00:37,130
indeed this gigantic deficits,
the past $550 billion dollars in 2017,

11
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:37,993
and most importantly,
how serious is it and how can it be 

12
00:00:40,131 --> 00:00:42,470
fixed?
While some of you might be thinking,

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,640
well,
that's easy,

14
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:44,503
there's a trade deficit because the 
United States imports more than it 

15
00:00:46,850 --> 00:00:47,683
exports among other things because of 
the evil unfair competition that has de 

16
00:00:50,810 --> 00:00:54,380
industrialized the country.
If we punish imports,

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,110
the trade deficit will decrease,
right?

18
00:00:57,200 --> 00:00:58,033
I mean after all,
this is the stance of the White House 

19
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:01,460
president trump.
Well,

20
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:05,060
just a moment here because things aren't
anywhere near as simple as this.

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:10,120
Listen up the easy equation

22
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,940
one,
choose,

23
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,610
magnify and report problem,
steps in place,

24
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,460
a number on the table that we can all 
visualize.

25
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:25,890
Step three,
creates ends blaming enemy,

26
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:28,650
whether it's real or not,
it doesn't really matter.

27
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:29,820
Step four,
one,

28
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:30,713
every one of the consequences of this 
problem and finally ends with a simple 

29
00:01:34,261 --> 00:01:37,650
and electoral remedy.
That is also false.

30
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,513
Folks,
these are the steps for creating a 

31
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:40,823
populist political discourse,
a discourse that at the moment of truth 

32
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:48,690
maybe worth absolutely nothing but will 
certainly help you win elections.

33
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:50,633
Well,
that's exactly what the White House is 

34
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:52,944
doing with the aim of winning votes.
They have created a political discourse 

35
00:01:55,711 --> 00:01:58,650
that so to speak,
is fundamentally based on eight,

36
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,030
three elements.
Equation,

37
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:04,350
but do not worry.
This has nothing to do with maths,

38
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,213
at least not entirely.
Seven's the trade deficit causes 

39
00:02:09,741 --> 00:02:11,330
terrible damage.
Seconds elements.

40
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:14,780
This damages due to the other countries,
unfair competition,

41
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:18,980
especially China and third,
the threat due to the other countries,

42
00:02:18,981 --> 00:02:23,000
bad behavior and the US as industry and 
power is falling apart.

43
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:25,600
However,
folks,

44
00:02:25,600 --> 00:02:30,190
discourse is one thing and the reality 
is quite different.

45
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:31,413
To magnify the problem,
Donald Trump's commercial advises us 

46
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,193
again and again about the negative 
impacts that this whole trade deficits 

47
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:39,783
has on the North American economy today,
so they use the accounting entity that 

48
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:44,314
you're seeing on the screen right now,
which is one of the formulas used to 

49
00:02:47,231 --> 00:02:48,064
calculate the GDP,
the US GDP equals consumption plus 

50
00:02:50,561 --> 00:02:54,310
investment plus public spending,
plus exports minus imports.

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:56,950
I mean there's really economics 101 
here.

52
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,973
Well the fact is that seeing it this way
makes it look like the trade deficit is 

53
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:05,650
causing a huge amount of damage to the U
s economy.

54
00:03:05,710 --> 00:03:09,670
And of course if the difference between 
exports and imports decreases,

55
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:14,700
then the GDP would increase prosperity 
for everyone.

56
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:16,720
Easy,
right?

57
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,553
Well hold on a second because this all 
implies simplifying things to the point 

58
00:03:20,831 --> 00:03:24,490
where any resemblance to reality is 
purely coincidental.

59
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,440
So why do I say this?
Well,

60
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,270
that's because relations with the rest 
of the world have a lot and I mean a lot

61
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:34,720
of influence on the other sections that 
make up the GDP.

62
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:36,100
Are you listening

63
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:44,950
at the end of the day when a foreigner 
invests in the United States?

64
00:03:44,951 --> 00:03:48,130
So when US companies buy raw materials,
capital goods,

65
00:03:48,131 --> 00:03:50,830
or intermediate goods,
the effects on the economy,

66
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:53,110
it's not exactly negative,
it's quite the opposite.

67
00:03:53,111 --> 00:03:54,220
Actually.
If for example,

68
00:03:54,221 --> 00:03:56,530
all these goods become expensive because
of tariffs,

69
00:03:56,531 --> 00:03:58,900
then companies lose competitiveness.
Heroin,

70
00:03:58,901 --> 00:04:00,520
visual politic.
We've already talked,

71
00:04:00,521 --> 00:04:01,354
for example,
about how terrorists have caused Harley 

72
00:04:03,160 --> 00:04:05,740
Davidson to move its processes to Europe
in a similar way,

73
00:04:05,770 --> 00:04:09,190
more expensive import products,
which also affects the retail sector.

74
00:04:09,191 --> 00:04:10,024
So that in the end,
the relationship of this supposed trade 

75
00:04:12,551 --> 00:04:17,530
deficit with the GDP isn't as direct as 
it might at first seem.

76
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,633
The second element of political 
discourse that the White House uses is 

77
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:26,490
that of unfair competition,
especially in the case of China.

78
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:29,520
And of course supposedly because of 
Beijing's bat actions,

79
00:04:29,521 --> 00:04:33,810
China's goods and services deficit alone
exceeds $300,000,000,000

80
00:04:33,811 --> 00:04:38,160
per year.
And that's when from things,

81
00:04:38,161 --> 00:04:38,994
well,
let's see if we decrease China's trade 

82
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:42,210
deficit,
then problem solved,

83
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,530
right?
Well folks,

84
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:44,364
things,
they don't actually work that way 

85
00:04:45,661 --> 00:04:46,351
either.
First,

86
00:04:46,351 --> 00:04:49,470
this unfair competition is at the very 
least questionable.

87
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,393
China has been blamed for manipulating 
its currency and that's just not really 

88
00:04:54,421 --> 00:04:55,410
true.
In fact,

89
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:57,810
it's actually the opposite.
In recent years,

90
00:04:57,811 --> 00:05:01,740
the Chinese yuan has risen a lot against
the dollar and do you know what happened

91
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:03,930
to the trade deficit with China?
Went to Beijing,

92
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,620
didn't devalue its currency to export 
more or they shot up?

93
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,430
Well,
in reality,

94
00:05:19,431 --> 00:05:23,300
the US a trade deficit with East Asia in
terms of manufactured goods,

95
00:05:23,330 --> 00:05:26,330
has been more or less constant since the
mid nineties.

96
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:29,583
What has changed is that what ones came 
from Taiwan or Japan among others now 

97
00:05:33,201 --> 00:05:38,090
comes directly from China and it's 
because it's a great assembly center and

98
00:05:38,091 --> 00:05:42,740
that's precisely what fattens the US 
trade deficit with China quite so much.

99
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,033
And regarding that last point is the one
about deindustrialization and loss of 

100
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:50,870
competitiveness due to unfair 
competition.

101
00:05:50,930 --> 00:05:52,190
Well,
it isn't true either.

102
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:53,083
US exports,
which remains the second largest 

103
00:05:55,041 --> 00:05:59,420
exporter in the world are at record,
just like industrial production.

104
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:04,510
Check this out,
I'm sorry,

105
00:06:07,311 --> 00:06:10,700
but China isn't devouring the American 
economy.

106
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,953
Just a second then.
If trump's arguments aren't true about 

107
00:06:14,391 --> 00:06:19,200
the entire United States trade deficit,
why is that such an imbalance?

108
00:06:19,201 --> 00:06:21,560
What are the real reasons for it?
Well,

109
00:06:21,561 --> 00:06:26,561
listen to this,
the real reasons you may be surprised to

110
00:06:33,651 --> 00:06:34,484
find out,
but what caused the US trade deficit 

111
00:06:36,081 --> 00:06:41,081
wasn't any country's unfair competition.
This time the fault is all at higher.

112
00:06:41,210 --> 00:06:42,043
Yes,
leaving the theories that speak of evil 

113
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,300
Chinese schemes to destroy the West 
might be less exciting,

114
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:50,030
but I'm sorry.
It's just the way things are.

115
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:59,120
The commercial whole is due to the low 
savings rate in the United States.

116
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,013
The United States dollar is a reserve 
currency which makes it highly demanded 

117
00:07:03,021 --> 00:07:03,854
and I have a values and then there's the
huge amounts of capital that comes to 

118
00:07:05,991 --> 00:07:08,180
the United States every year from 
abroad.

119
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,043
For example,
from China as we are going to see this 

120
00:07:10,491 --> 00:07:13,940
is what explains why the United States 
spent more than 40 years.

121
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:16,730
We have a trade deficit without the 
economy's suffering.

122
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:17,623
Forty years in a row can,
assuming more than it produces because 

123
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,674
folks,
trump always talks about the trade 

124
00:07:23,001 --> 00:07:27,140
balance but never talks about the 
financial balance and that's the trap.

125
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:28,073
$800,000,000,000
a year trade deficit with other nations 

126
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,090
unaccepted.
They send the Mercedes,

127
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,550
they sent bmw,
they send everything

128
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:45,700
absolutely.
Last game

129
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,733
and economic law that the US president 
seems to be unfamiliar with the balance 

130
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,634
of payments which measures the monetary 
transactions of a country with the 

131
00:07:55,161 --> 00:07:55,994
exterior is always in equilibrium in a 
system of floating exchange rates like 

132
00:07:59,931 --> 00:08:03,230
the one that exists nowadays.
Allow me to explain that a bit further.

133
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:07,370
When there's a trade deficits,
it's basically compensated by capital or

134
00:08:07,371 --> 00:08:08,204
financial account surpluses,
which more or less reflect the balance 

135
00:08:11,721 --> 00:08:15,140
between the capital that arrives in the 
country and what leaves it.

136
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:18,860
That's the money that comes in and the 
money that goes out.

137
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:24,200
A persistent current account surplus is 
always balanced out by a capital account

138
00:08:24,201 --> 00:08:25,034
deficit.
It's one of the eternal laws of 

139
00:08:26,331 --> 00:08:27,164
economics like gravity and physics.
Conrad poot sear a reporter at the real 

140
00:08:30,951 --> 00:08:31,784
deal.
Look at what happens precisely with the 

141
00:08:34,670 --> 00:08:35,503
United States balance of payment

142
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:40,690
s.
As you can

143
00:08:41,430 --> 00:08:44,190
see,
the trade deficit is offset by surpluses

144
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:46,250
in the financial balances.
Now,

145
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:50,460
does this mean that a country can buy 
whatever it wants abroad without limits?

146
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,150
Well,
no,

147
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:51,983
obviously not.
It can only important if it manages to 

148
00:08:54,151 --> 00:08:56,300
finance or for.
It's important.

149
00:08:56,301 --> 00:08:57,134
We have capital that comes from abroad,
otherwise first its currency would 

150
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:00,684
depreciate a lot,
say pure law of supply and demand is 

151
00:09:02,701 --> 00:09:06,180
high demand for foreign currency and 
offer local currency,

152
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:07,043
and then eventually the foreign currency
reserves of the central bank would dry 

153
00:09:09,661 --> 00:09:14,100
up on leashing and exchange crisis.
This is something that in Latin America,

154
00:09:14,101 --> 00:09:16,710
especially in Argentina,
is very well known.

155
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:20,551
Well.
All right,

156
00:09:20,551 --> 00:09:23,550
so what happens in the U s case?
Well,

157
00:09:23,551 --> 00:09:26,940
America is the greatest refuge for 
capital on the entire planet.

158
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:28,110
Therefore,
every year,

159
00:09:28,140 --> 00:09:28,973
huge amounts of capital and so the 
country practically half of the world's 

160
00:09:31,791 --> 00:09:32,624
savings spent investing in this country,
either his loans direct foreign 

161
00:09:36,061 --> 00:09:39,360
investment all by buying shares on this,
etc.

162
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:43,560
Have you noticed,
for example,

163
00:09:43,590 --> 00:09:47,160
the impressive run that the snp 500 has 
had over the last nine years?

164
00:09:47,161 --> 00:09:47,994
Well,
it's precisely that enormous capital 

165
00:09:49,861 --> 00:09:50,694
flow arriving every year to the United 
States that allows americans to consume 

166
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,643
more than they produce,
which despite in carrying commercial 

167
00:09:57,841 --> 00:10:00,510
deficits for more than 40 consecutive 
years,

168
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,403
has led the country to practically 
always find employments and record 

169
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:06,600
levels of exports and industrial 
production.

170
00:10:06,690 --> 00:10:09,270
Considering tHat we can understand 
things like this,

171
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,750
whether it's Japan in the 19 eighties,
Germany,

172
00:10:12,751 --> 00:10:15,030
and the two thousands or China in recent
years,

173
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:15,923
countries that invest heavily in the New
York real estate market also tend to 

174
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:21,600
have a massive trade surplus with the 
United States.

175
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:24,030
Conrad puts sierra,
a reporter at the real deal.

176
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:24,923
Basically thanks to the capital that 
comes from abroad to the United States 

177
00:10:27,541 --> 00:10:30,300
can afford to consume more than it 
produces,

178
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:32,820
so in addition to exporting goods and 
services,

179
00:10:32,821 --> 00:10:36,600
the United States also export's 
financial securities.

180
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:38,100
This is the key,
but wait,

181
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:38,963
does this need that?
The fiscal deficits combi reduced 

182
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,180
actually not at all.

183
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:50,820
How to decrease the commercial

184
00:10:51,210 --> 00:10:52,043
set.

185
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:53,943
As you can see,
sometimes things aren't as they seem at 

186
00:10:56,261 --> 00:10:57,094
fest.
Having a trade deficit doesn't have to 

187
00:10:58,661 --> 00:11:00,010
be bad.
After all,

188
00:11:00,011 --> 00:11:03,970
the ultimate economic objective must be 
to improve living conditions.

189
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:08,080
That is the ability to consume more and 
the better goods and services.

190
00:11:12,050 --> 00:11:15,080
Yes,
a bulky and continuing trade deficits.

191
00:11:15,110 --> 00:11:17,210
It can have some drawbacks.
For example,

192
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:22,220
assumes more risk or risk that capital 
will stop flowing towards the country,

193
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,220
which could lead to a huge crisis.
And for another,

194
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:26,083
it favors debt growth.
The country flooded with money from 

195
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,754
abroad.
That means abundant and cheap money and 

196
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:31,813
he doesn't want money.
So let's continue with the key question 

197
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:34,874
here.
How can Donald Trump decrease the us 

198
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,420
trade deficit?
Well,

199
00:11:38,421 --> 00:11:39,254
there are mainly three options too that 
we should set aside and it's one that's 

200
00:11:43,011 --> 00:11:43,844
highly recommend.
Those we did recommends would be either 

201
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,133
agreeing to devalue the dollar and stop 
it from being the hegemonic currency of 

202
00:11:52,561 --> 00:11:53,394
the world with the federal reserve.
So importance would be much more 

203
00:11:55,691 --> 00:11:58,940
expensive and nobody would want to take 
their money to thiS couNtry or the u.

204
00:11:58,941 --> 00:12:01,300
S could restrict the caPital coming from
abroad,

205
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,860
for example,
through taxes.

206
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:05,230
Of course,
that in the long run is also going to be

207
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:06,064
a disaster

208
00:12:09,190 --> 00:12:12,030
because the other option,
the one that we'd recommend is consuming

209
00:12:12,031 --> 00:12:12,864
less,
saving more favoring productive 

210
00:12:14,431 --> 00:12:15,264
investments.
That way fewer foreign lines would be 

211
00:12:16,891 --> 00:12:17,724
demanded and much more wealth would be 
generated so that it's in percentage 

212
00:12:20,881 --> 00:12:24,180
terms over the gdp.
Trade deficits would be much smaller.

213
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,940
And to achieve this goal,
stopping the government's growing fiscal

214
00:12:26,941 --> 00:12:29,400
hold would be a fantastic idea.
But trump,

215
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,100
despite what he's saying,
is going in the opposite direction,

216
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:32,993
it would also be a fantastic option to 
allow american companies to fill the 

217
00:12:35,971 --> 00:12:36,804
nearly 6 million vacant jobs that the 
north american economy suffers from 

218
00:12:39,871 --> 00:12:42,840
today by bringing in professionals from 
abroad.

219
00:12:45,810 --> 00:12:46,643
However,
protectionist policies don't work first 

220
00:12:48,541 --> 00:12:49,374
because all the other countries tend to 
respond to tariffs with their own 

221
00:12:52,171 --> 00:12:53,750
tariffs,
which reduces imports,

222
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:54,683
but also exports and most importantly,
because the increased costs led by 

223
00:12:57,841 --> 00:13:01,170
terrorists make the United States and 
less attractive country to invest in,

224
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,750
and that's in the longterm.
It's a really bad thing.

225
00:13:06,390 --> 00:13:07,223
Perhaps folks,
the strongest proof that american 

226
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:13,320
companies need to be open to the world 
is found in the trump family itself.

227
00:13:13,350 --> 00:13:16,080
See ivanka trump,
the president's daughter and white house

228
00:13:16,081 --> 00:13:16,914
special advisor,
has just closed her clothing and 

229
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:19,764
accessories brands.
Ivanka made this decision after 

230
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:22,313
suffering a steep drop in sales and a 
huge amount of criticism for some 

231
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,590
alleged contradictions.
And do you know why she was criticized?

232
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,453
Well,
can you guess where she wants to making 

233
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:32,250
products?
I mean,

234
00:13:32,490 --> 00:13:35,310
surely in the United States rights.
Well,

235
00:13:35,370 --> 00:13:36,750
no,
actually wrong.

236
00:13:36,751 --> 00:13:38,520
The correct answer was China.

237
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,413
Most of our products are made in China 
and also in countries like Vietnam and 

238
00:13:42,241 --> 00:13:43,074
Indonesia has ivanka trump has self been
an accomplice of the evil entities that 

239
00:13:46,861 --> 00:13:49,650
have been attacking the United States.
Well,

240
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:50,970
I'm just going to leave that.

a year trade deficit with other nations.

252
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,970
Unacceptable.
