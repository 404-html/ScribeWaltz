1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
The People's Republic of China has 
changed a lot since it was founded in 

2
00:00:03,511 --> 00:00:08,511
1949 as a hard line socialist country.
So much so that if Mao himself rose from

3
00:00:09,391 --> 00:00:11,910
the grave,
it probably fall right back into it.

4
00:00:11,911 --> 00:00:12,744
Yeah.
In the 1970s China was a country of 

5
00:00:20,161 --> 00:00:21,870
very,
very poor farmers.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:24,690
Well,
now it's a world superpower and economic

7
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:25,593
powerhouse.
No country in history has grown so fast 

8
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,000
or has gotten so many people out of 
poverty as China has done in the last 40

9
00:00:33,001 --> 00:00:33,834
years.

10
00:00:34,940 --> 00:00:35,630
Okay.

11
00:00:35,630 --> 00:00:36,463
Throughout this time,
this country has grown as an average 

12
00:00:38,261 --> 00:00:39,094
rate of almost 10% per year,
and most importantly almost 800 million 

13
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:46,060
people,
more than the entire population of Latin

14
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:48,790
America,
Spain and Portugal have escaped poverty.

15
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,610
I'm pretty sure this isn't news to you 
or anyone else.

16
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,730
Box.
How did China manage to change?

17
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:03,623
Do you think that this entire 
transformation was the result of a 

18
00:01:05,971 --> 00:01:06,804
carefully drawn plan,
some intricate strategy maps out spite 

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:10,890
China's leaders?
Well,

20
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:13,500
you viewer,
I think that this story has a twist that

21
00:01:13,501 --> 00:01:16,140
is probably going to surprise you.
So listen up.

22
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:17,880
By the way,
before we get into the video today,

23
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:18,714
I did want to thank everyone who has 
been supporting us on page on in just a 

24
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:22,853
few days.
We've got 650 have you on board helping 

25
00:01:25,231 --> 00:01:28,050
us out in making these videos?
We're right now working hardware,

26
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:28,913
preparing a lot of surprises and we're 
going to have great stuff in store for 

27
00:01:31,561 --> 00:01:34,890
people who are supporting us on paper.
You're on consider doing it if you want.

28
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:35,753
It would be cool.
There's a link in the description below 

29
00:01:37,051 --> 00:01:37,884
and let's crack on.

30
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:45,970
Okay.
Yeah.

31
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:47,803
On October the first 1949 miles a dong 
proclaims the existence of the People's 

32
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,063
Republic of China.
He did this from Tienanmen Square in 

33
00:01:54,171 --> 00:01:59,171
Beijing and he did so with a very clear 
slogan and that was China has stood up.

34
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,373
Wow.

35
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:21,563
However,
in the following three decades that 

36
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:27,030
reality had changed a lot.
Now is rather obsessed with the ideology

37
00:02:27,031 --> 00:02:29,970
willing to implant the societal model 
that he has.

38
00:02:29,971 --> 00:02:30,804
In his mind,
that's pretty much any cost as among 

39
00:02:33,241 --> 00:02:34,074
other things to view where he thought 
the Beijing could decide everything and 

40
00:02:36,841 --> 00:02:38,630
determine the future of everything.

41
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:43,240
Much

42
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,580
to produce,
what to produce,

43
00:02:44,581 --> 00:02:47,220
how to distribute the workers,
how many factories were needed,

44
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:49,530
how the goods were to be distributed and
production,

45
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,940
et Cetera,
et Cetera,

46
00:02:50,941 --> 00:02:52,320
et cetera.
And not only that,

47
00:02:52,321 --> 00:02:53,154
the other thing that was clear to mouth 
was that any dissidents was a danger 

48
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,790
that hat to be eliminated.
Of course,

49
00:03:03,631 --> 00:03:06,690
as you can imagine,
these ideas in the hands of someone with

50
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:10,620
so much power and so much stubbornness 
certainly had consequences.

51
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:15,930
Some studies estimate that during the 
almost 30 years that mel was the supreme

52
00:03:15,931 --> 00:03:16,764
leader of China.
Between 50 and 70 million people lost 

53
00:03:20,521 --> 00:03:23,490
their lives due to famine,
political persecution,

54
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,320
and absolute poverty.
Yeah.

55
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:29,243
And after 30 years in power,
after collectivizing all of China's 

56
00:03:31,981 --> 00:03:32,814
lands and properties and brutally 
persecuting millions and millions of 

57
00:03:35,311 --> 00:03:36,730
intellectuals,
academics,

58
00:03:36,731 --> 00:03:39,120
and anyone who wasn't comfortable with 
the regime,

59
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:42,150
well,
China was plunged into misery,

60
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,640
cultural revolution,
wrecked,

61
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,940
devastation on the lives of millions of 
Chinese people.

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:48,803
For 10 years,
the nation was reduced to a state of 

63
00:03:51,181 --> 00:03:52,014
barbarism,
Shao Hahn and associate professor at 

64
00:03:54,451 --> 00:03:56,700
China,
University of Political Science and law.

65
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:02,273
I've found time,
more than 80% of all Chinese people 

66
00:04:04,981 --> 00:04:08,040
lived in miserable conditions.
Famine was common.

67
00:04:08,041 --> 00:04:12,450
Political terror purges where the order 
of the day and the living standard swear

68
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:16,890
comparable to that of some countries in 
sub Saharan Africa and all of this,

69
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:19,380
while Japan and the Asian dragons of 
Hong Kong,

70
00:04:19,381 --> 00:04:21,450
Taiwan,
South Korea and Singapore,

71
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:25,770
we're taking off enormously.
That's why we call and be surprised that

72
00:04:25,771 --> 00:04:26,604
when mel died in 1976 the Chinese 
communist party divided into three very 

73
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:31,943
different sectors.
The radicals they'd by Jen Ching now's 

74
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:36,870
own widow,
how gong fangs moderate reformers,

75
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:40,430
and it's the most aggressive reformers 
led by Dang Shao Ping.

76
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:41,264
Yeah.
Leanne's after a lot of push and pull 

77
00:04:45,611 --> 00:04:49,210
and often making it clear that China 
couldn't stay the way it was any longer.

78
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,073
In 1978 it was the latter.
The most convinced reformers who took 

79
00:04:53,291 --> 00:04:54,124
the lead.

80
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:57,773
Yeah,

81
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:07,063
black cat and the white cat.
Remember the questions that I asked at 

82
00:05:11,531 --> 00:05:12,580
the beginning of the video?
Well,

83
00:05:12,581 --> 00:05:16,600
let's answer the first one right now.
How did China manage to change?

84
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:17,220
It's called

85
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:18,053
yes.

86
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,560
In December of 1978 at the 11th congress
of the Chinese Communist Party,

87
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:25,840
the reformist,
Dang she,

88
00:05:25,841 --> 00:05:27,850
I'll ping,
took over the country's leadership.

89
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,023
Then Shannon Penn argued that the 
ideological utopia that had damaged 

90
00:05:34,121 --> 00:05:34,954
China so much had to be set aside and 
that they needed to commit to 

91
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,490
modernization.
In fact,

92
00:05:39,491 --> 00:05:42,370
you might already be familiar with his 
most famous phrase.

93
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,700
It doesn't matter whether the cat is 
black or white,

94
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:48,000
as long as it catches mice,
Dung shall pain,

95
00:05:48,310 --> 00:05:49,143
and as a viewer,
that's precisely what he did for the 

96
00:05:50,291 --> 00:05:52,810
following 10 years because if we have to
say something,

97
00:05:52,811 --> 00:05:55,750
it's that the reforms weren't exactly 
very quick,

98
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:57,710
but you might now be wondering,
well,

99
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:58,640
okay,
Simon,

100
00:05:58,641 --> 00:06:01,550
but what exactly were their priorities?
Well,

101
00:06:01,551 --> 00:06:02,384
from an economic perspective,
we can classify the reforms into three 

102
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,680
big blocks,
agriculture,

103
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:10,340
industry and trade and sweat.
It all began in the fields.

104
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,720
We've already mentioned that at the 
time,

105
00:06:11,721 --> 00:06:14,540
China was fundamentally a country of 
peasants.

106
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:23,623
Well,
the agrarian reform do you collectivize 

107
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,173
the countryside and the communes were 
suppressed and replaced by the usual 

108
00:06:29,301 --> 00:06:33,620
family exploitation model.
In addition,

109
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:34,454
the so called household responsibility 
system was implemented by which many 

110
00:06:37,461 --> 00:06:38,294
decisions Sanchez,
what type of crops to plant spot 

111
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:43,430
investments to make what tools and get 
and by past from the governments,

112
00:06:43,431 --> 00:06:46,070
from the bureaucrats to the families 
themselves.

113
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:46,933
And not only that,
the peasants had to sell parts of their 

114
00:06:48,231 --> 00:06:51,250
harvest to the state and then could sell
the rest on the free market,

115
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:56,320
a completely free prices.
And that was a huge revolution.

116
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:58,064
But this time the good kinds 
agricultural production soared and food 

117
00:07:00,561 --> 00:07:01,394
prices dropped.
Well the peasants living conditions 

118
00:07:03,051 --> 00:07:07,880
improved a lot.
I'm,

119
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:08,723
the results were good.
So Beijing decided to apply similar 

120
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:11,724
reforms to the industry sector.
That way the government gradually 

121
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:14,994
transfer decision making from Beijing's 
ministries to government owned 

122
00:07:18,211 --> 00:07:19,290
companies.
Yes,

123
00:07:19,291 --> 00:07:21,750
the decisions where it's still coming 
down from the government,

124
00:07:21,751 --> 00:07:25,140
but let's just say they were working 
under different criteria.

125
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:26,890
That one,

126
00:07:26,890 --> 00:07:27,940
wait,
let's all buy less.

127
00:07:27,941 --> 00:07:31,390
All throughout the 1980s governments 
owned company managers were able to make

128
00:07:31,391 --> 00:07:34,060
decisions such as sharing benefits among
workers,

129
00:07:34,061 --> 00:07:35,650
paying productivity,
bonuses,

130
00:07:35,651 --> 00:07:37,840
grounding the freedom to hire and fire 
employees,

131
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:40,840
deciding which suppliers to work with 
the setting free prices.

132
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:41,703
And the list goes on.
It makes sense because who better than 

133
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:52,720
the companies own managers to decide 
what they need to work better?

134
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,361
Well,
in addition,

135
00:07:57,361 --> 00:08:00,690
this was all the companies by the 
legalization of private companies.

136
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,820
So suddenly the government owned 
companies,

137
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:03,683
they had competition,
and there was also a trade reform in 

138
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,384
which little by little China allowed 
foreign trade by largely dismantling 

139
00:08:09,481 --> 00:08:11,310
import barriers,
tariffs.

140
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:13,110
However,
we owns agriculture,

141
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:15,990
the reforms,
they did face a huge problem.

142
00:08:16,050 --> 00:08:19,500
China was a very poor country,
and of course it has been either capital

143
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,090
nor technology.
So,

144
00:08:21,150 --> 00:08:22,950
well,
what did the government do?

145
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:24,990
Well,
this gets interesting.

146
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,263
Okay.

147
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,413
Special economic zones.
Beginning of the 1980s China was a very 

148
00:08:37,341 --> 00:08:39,200
poor country.
It was close to the world,

149
00:08:39,201 --> 00:08:40,034
and it lacks both money and technology.
Or what he did have was a large 

150
00:08:42,711 --> 00:08:46,250
workforce willing to work in better 
conditions than the ones they had in the

151
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:51,251
countryside.
So under these circumstances,

152
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,173
then she,
our pings government decided for an 

153
00:08:55,531 --> 00:08:57,810
experiment.
They didn't want to completely renounced

154
00:08:57,811 --> 00:09:00,270
the economic model of it.
They'd inherited from mouth,

155
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:01,163
but they did want to make something so 
they made special economic zones in 

156
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:06,210
areas where the communist system had 
stopped.

157
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,433
Okay.

158
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,523
In these areas,
foreign companies could invest and set 

159
00:09:11,401 --> 00:09:12,750
up factories.
That is,

160
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:15,210
they had access to the Chinese 
workforce.

161
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:18,900
That in itself was a huge advantage,
but that wasn't all.

162
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,793
They also have very few taxes,
relatively this will bureaucracy and 

163
00:09:22,831 --> 00:09:23,664
some no terrorists.

164
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:26,943
It was

165
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,300
essentially a smaller waist for 
multinationals in the middle of the then

166
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,450
hostile and Hermetic People's Republic 
of China.

167
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,840
Beijing's idea was very clear.
Bring technology,

168
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:39,580
bring capital,
bring work.

169
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:42,130
Initially for special economic zones 
were set up.

170
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,993
Shen Zen Zhuhai shall men and Shanto.
These were so successful that the 

171
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,820
authorities began planting them all over
the country.

172
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:50,023
Okay?

173
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:55,820
There's the case for example of 
Shenzhen,

174
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,890
when the special economic zone was 
created,

175
00:09:57,891 --> 00:10:01,940
the area was nothing more than a poor 
fishing village with just over 30,000

176
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:02,774
people.
Today it stands at 12 million 

177
00:10:04,341 --> 00:10:05,174
inhabitants.
It's GDP will soon as the past out of 

178
00:10:06,801 --> 00:10:07,634
Hong Kong itself,
and it's one of the world capitals of 

179
00:10:09,711 --> 00:10:12,680
technology and it's all happens in just 
a few decades.

180
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:17,690
Do you know

181
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,000
the company is quite away Dji or 10 
cents?

182
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:21,800
Well,
they're from this city,

183
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:22,693
these economic zones.
Success was so great that we can state 

184
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,590
that they were the precursors of China's
opening.

185
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:31,550
The shenton special economic zone is an 
experiment.

186
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:34,310
We need more time to see whether it has 
gone well.

187
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:36,530
We wish it success.
If it fails,

188
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,463
it will provide some lessons.
Dung shopping because folks Dang shall 

189
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,160
pings.
Initial idea was to use these areas,

190
00:10:43,161 --> 00:10:43,994
not to open up the country to gain 
resources so that the government could 

191
00:10:47,391 --> 00:10:48,224
maintain the old model.
It's often thought that China's 

192
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:50,983
transformation was perfectly drawn 
designs and calculated by the Beijing 

193
00:10:54,681 --> 00:10:55,700
government.
However,

194
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,250
and this might surprise you,
it wasn't like this,

195
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:06,770
the marginalist revolution,

196
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:08,103
Huh?

197
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,460
For the Chinese reforms where plans by 
the Beijing governments,

198
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:13,960
but where are they really?

199
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:16,800
Well?
Well,

200
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,800
you see often Mao's death,
China with a wreck.

201
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:22,290
The last crusade of these so called 
great helmsmen.

202
00:11:22,291 --> 00:11:25,740
The Cultural Revolution had left the 
country in tatters.

203
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,593
Mao's cultural revolution producer 
results opposite to what he presumably 

204
00:11:30,481 --> 00:11:34,500
intended leading many Chinese solutions,
faith in their government altogether.

205
00:11:34,710 --> 00:11:35,543
Frank Dakota,
Dutch historian who specializes in 

206
00:11:37,711 --> 00:11:38,970
modern China.
In fact,

207
00:11:38,971 --> 00:11:42,120
it was during this period,
the black markets began to spread places

208
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:44,580
where people try to survive outside of 
the system.

209
00:11:44,610 --> 00:11:48,120
And that also meant a very important 
cultural change.

210
00:11:48,150 --> 00:11:51,750
Perhaps that's why often Mao's death 
before the transitions chaos,

211
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,160
some changes began to happen 
automatically.

212
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,463
For example,
while the government continued to 

213
00:11:57,461 --> 00:11:58,294
promote collectivized agriculture,
some regions revolted and decided to 

214
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:02,134
implement this,
the family exploitation system on their 

215
00:12:03,941 --> 00:12:04,774
own,
even though this manager breaking the 

216
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:10,000
law and returning de facto to a private 
exploitation systems.

217
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,393
And of course,
as this initiative started gaining more 

218
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,734
and more followers,
the Beijing government finally decided 

219
00:12:16,451 --> 00:12:18,160
to establish these changes,
uh,

220
00:12:18,161 --> 00:12:18,994
state policies,
but it was actually following these 

221
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:23,230
changes that caused the change in 
society.

222
00:12:23,290 --> 00:12:24,123
Something similar.
It happens with private businesses in 

223
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:26,644
the cities you see often Mao's death.
Many young people had been sent to the 

224
00:12:32,951 --> 00:12:34,960
countryside,
returned to the cities,

225
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,620
and since there was no work,
they tried to sort it out themselves and

226
00:12:38,621 --> 00:12:39,454
the government is simply had to accept 
it and suddenly private stores be under 

227
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,003
multiplied like mushrooms in every 
Chinese city ending the state's 

228
00:12:46,151 --> 00:12:48,620
commercial monopoly once and for all.

229
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,723
And in a way,
the same thing happens with the 

230
00:12:53,781 --> 00:12:54,614
municipal and regional companies which 
began to emerge outside of state 

231
00:12:57,381 --> 00:12:58,214
control.
This led them to be the most dynamic in 

232
00:13:00,441 --> 00:13:02,390
China for years.
Yes,

233
00:13:02,391 --> 00:13:03,224
it's true.
Dang shopping's government didn't stop 

234
00:13:04,851 --> 00:13:05,790
these changes.
Is it?

235
00:13:05,810 --> 00:13:06,643
On the contrary,
he ended up implementing them as 

236
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,470
policies.
But as you can see,

237
00:13:09,471 --> 00:13:12,800
a large part of the change,
far more than what we're often told,

238
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,530
came from the bottom up and not the top 
down.

239
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,393
By the way,
maybe that's why China's transformation 

240
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:20,900
was so great and it happens in such a 
short amount of time,

241
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,823
by the way,
before you go and beat us up in the 

242
00:13:22,581 --> 00:13:25,430
comments,
we do know that Sean Penn was no saint,

243
00:13:25,431 --> 00:13:27,980
he was a dictator.
And without going much further,

244
00:13:27,981 --> 00:13:31,030
we can see that the tnm and repression 
was his own

245
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:31,953
doing,

246
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,523
but now it's your turn.
Do you think China will ends up ever 

247
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:38,580
becoming a democracy?
Well,

248
00:13:38,581 --> 00:13:39,414
leave your answer in the comments below
