1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,070
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:08,303
Here's the question.
Everyone's been wondering for the past 

3
00:00:10,350 --> 00:00:11,183
few days,
what would happen if both North Korea 

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,320
and South Korea merged in z one single 
nation?

5
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:17,930
Yes,
I know this isn't something that's going

6
00:00:17,931 --> 00:00:18,764
to happen in the near future,
but it certainly is a possibility and 

7
00:00:21,631 --> 00:00:24,780
one that might actually happen sooner 
than we expect.

8
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:27,420
Just one year ago,
nobody would have predicted that.

9
00:00:27,421 --> 00:00:28,254
Now in the spring of 2018 Kim Jong UN 
would shake hands with the South Korean 

10
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:33,804
President Moon Gin.
So what would a Korean reunification 

11
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:41,913
look like?
The truth is that is historical 

12
00:00:43,751 --> 00:00:45,340
precedent and for all of this,
yes,

13
00:00:45,341 --> 00:00:49,300
my day view is of course I'm talking 
about German reunification.

14
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:50,660
As you may remember,
Germany,

15
00:00:50,661 --> 00:00:51,494
he used to be divided into two separate 
countries and eastern block with a 

16
00:00:53,991 --> 00:00:57,730
socialist communist regime and the 
Western block with a capitalist system,

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:05,610
Berlin Wall came down and East Germany 
was absorbed by Westerman and since then

18
00:01:05,611 --> 00:01:06,444
the government has spent lots of money 
so that the eastern Germans could enjoy 

19
00:01:08,761 --> 00:01:11,280
a similar lifestyle to the wealthier 
western Germans.

20
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,770
Many experts consider this a success 
story.

21
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,633
Some of them claimed that this could be 
a model for what the integration of 

22
00:01:17,521 --> 00:01:19,440
North and South Korea might look like.
I mean,

23
00:01:19,441 --> 00:01:20,850
think about it.
In both cases,

24
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:23,670
there's capitalism and socialism.
In both cases.

25
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:25,980
One side is Paul,
while the other side as wealthy,

26
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:28,920
and in both cases they share a common 
language,

27
00:01:28,980 --> 00:01:30,260
common history,
and to come in.

28
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,843
But now the question is,
what was the German reunification as 

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:38,664
successful as it looks on paper?
Can we say East Germans today aren't 

30
00:01:41,211 --> 00:01:44,040
doing as well as their western Nader's?
Well,

31
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:46,440
the answer is no.
Even in soccer,

32
00:01:46,441 --> 00:01:49,170
we can see small differences.
Since Germany was reunited,

33
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,004
there've been no eastern teams in the 
Bundesliga since 2009 the western teams 

34
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:56,430
still dominate the national sport.
In fact,

35
00:01:56,431 --> 00:01:59,450
there is only one east German team in 
the Buddhists Liga,

36
00:01:59,540 --> 00:02:00,373
the rb Leipzig,
but it's just one team and a soccer 

37
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:06,000
league of over 18 teams.
And the same applies in economics.

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,840
But where the differences turn more 
scary is when we talk about politics.

39
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,550
For example,
in the last election,

40
00:02:11,551 --> 00:02:15,960
the radical rightwing afd has ended the 
parliament as the third largest party.

41
00:02:15,961 --> 00:02:19,860
This radical anti immigrants and euro 
skeptic party has gained the majority of

42
00:02:19,861 --> 00:02:23,010
its vote from regions in the former East
Germany.

43
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:23,903
This is mark the first time since 1961 
that a far right party that says this 

44
00:02:27,241 --> 00:02:28,074
kind of presence in German parliaments 
and that's a view is actually pretty 

45
00:02:30,931 --> 00:02:35,120
frightening.
Benj of the east.

46
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,270
How anger in former GDR helped the afd.
So the real question here is this is the

47
00:02:41,301 --> 00:02:42,134
process of reunification done.
What can we learn from Germany if it 

48
00:02:45,501 --> 00:02:47,990
could be applied to north and South 
Korea?

49
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:48,913
Well,
today we aren't going to answer this 

50
00:02:49,971 --> 00:02:50,990
question,
but before we do,

51
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,003
let's take a look back at the history to
the victors go the spoils often or it's 

52
00:02:56,870 --> 00:02:57,703
unconditional surrender,
the allies divided and to for military 

53
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:03,280
occupation zones,
Britain in the northwest,

54
00:03:03,281 --> 00:03:04,390
France,
in the southwest,

55
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:07,780
the USA and the south and the Soviet 
Union in the east.

56
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,930
There's a lot more we could say about 
this time,

57
00:03:12,931 --> 00:03:15,290
but we're not going to go into every 
little detail because,

58
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:15,781
well,
if we did,

59
00:03:15,781 --> 00:03:18,000
you'd be staring at my face for a couple
of hours.

60
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:18,863
Yeah.
But suffice it to say that from 1949 

61
00:03:20,611 --> 00:03:23,430
Germany was transformed into two 
different countries.

62
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,293
West Germany officially known as the 
Federal Republic of Germany with on as 

63
00:03:27,601 --> 00:03:28,434
its capital and East Germany whose 
official name was the Democratic 

64
00:03:30,781 --> 00:03:32,970
Republic of Germany with its capital and
East Berlin.

65
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,160
East Germany was the communist region.
Well,

66
00:03:35,161 --> 00:03:38,100
West Germany became the embodiment of 
its capitalists.

67
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,963
Occupants.
While West Berlin started to look more 

68
00:03:40,741 --> 00:03:43,140
and more like a big city would in the 
United States,

69
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:45,390
east Berlin became Moscow's carbon.
Yeah.

70
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:46,273
Top.

71
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,520
According to East Germany's first 
constitution,

72
00:03:50,521 --> 00:03:52,710
its citizens enjoyed certain basic 
rights,

73
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:53,623
even the rights to strike,
but in reality it was a little freedom 

74
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:59,470
or policy related matters were decided 
by the Pellissippi Eric,

75
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,920
the executive committee of the Socialist
Unity Party.

76
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:02,893
That's the main and almost only source 
of information in the country was 

77
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:07,223
directly financed by the only party.
Here's a great example of just how 

78
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,610
unbiased it was.

79
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:14,980
Sure.

80
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:19,540
The Central Oregon of the Socialist 
Unity Party celebrating 100 years of the

81
00:04:19,541 --> 00:04:22,160
communist manifesto.
East Germany's economy,

82
00:04:22,161 --> 00:04:22,994
as you may have already guessed,
was it century plans and almost 

83
00:04:25,041 --> 00:04:25,874
completely owned by the state,
the central governments at the price of 

84
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:30,950
housing,
basic goods and even services.

85
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:31,903
So basically every year the government 
would publish a list with the mandatory 

86
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,910
prices of every basic good.
You'd want to buy a bread roll,

87
00:04:37,911 --> 00:04:38,744
five marks,
a thousand bucks for a Sony Walkman and 

88
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,280
so on and so forth.
Even if you had the money,

89
00:04:43,281 --> 00:04:46,370
there were waiting lists in place for 
goods like cars and electronics.

90
00:04:46,371 --> 00:04:48,830
I mean,
who really wants to wait 10 years to get

91
00:04:48,831 --> 00:04:51,770
a travel card?
Take the unemployment generated by these

92
00:04:51,771 --> 00:04:52,970
strips,
price control,

93
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:57,971
take all of those empty supermarkets,
take the scarcity of primary basic goods

94
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,850
and pair those with aliments like a low 
birth rate and guess what?

95
00:05:01,851 --> 00:05:04,670
You guys,
you got lots and lots of people who want

96
00:05:04,671 --> 00:05:05,504
to escape.

97
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,383
Jen,

98
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:13,050
what did the government do about this?
Well,

99
00:05:13,051 --> 00:05:13,884
they built a wall to stop people leaving
the country in order to justify this 

100
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:17,413
movie.
The official state propaganda claims 

101
00:05:18,661 --> 00:05:21,900
that they were building the walls.
You protected their country from fascist

102
00:05:21,901 --> 00:05:24,570
infiltration.
That the actual reason it was exactly,

103
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:25,593
yeah.

104
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:34,870
As you can imagine,
what would having a literal wall between

105
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,704
them,
the relationship between east and West 

106
00:05:37,541 --> 00:05:40,060
Germany wasn't exactly friendly.
In fact,

107
00:05:40,061 --> 00:05:40,894
West Germany didn't even recognize the 
East German government because they 

108
00:05:43,091 --> 00:05:43,924
claim to be the only legitimate state 
for all Janice and to the east did the 

109
00:05:48,071 --> 00:05:48,904
same thing.
Now this might actually remind you of 

110
00:05:50,621 --> 00:05:51,250
something.
Yes.

111
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,040
It's more or less the relationship that 
the two careers have with each other.

112
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,320
Although in the former case,
there were no nuclear bombs involved and

113
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,260
just like north and South Korea raw 
reaching an agreement,

114
00:06:00,261 --> 00:06:01,094
east and West Germany normalize their 
relations in the 1970s but the real 

115
00:06:04,341 --> 00:06:05,174
twist in history that came in the year 
1989 no one could have anticipated that 

116
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:18,590
the 40th anniversary of the GDR would 
also be,

117
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:22,040
it's lost and that Germany would be 
reunited one small,

118
00:06:22,190 --> 00:06:26,690
but then history if found a way to 
surprise us all the speed at which these

119
00:06:26,691 --> 00:06:27,524
changes occurred with astounding only 10
months after the fall of the wall east 

120
00:06:31,431 --> 00:06:34,400
and West Germany,
we'd become a single nation.

121
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,820
The new Germany has here,
secretary of state,

122
00:06:38,821 --> 00:06:39,571
James A.
Baker,

123
00:06:39,571 --> 00:06:43,110
the third set,
let her legacy be that after 45 years we

124
00:06:43,111 --> 00:06:45,330
finally got the political arithmetic 
right.

125
00:06:45,420 --> 00:06:46,253
Two plus four adds up to one Germany in 
a Europe whole and free bus make no 

126
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:51,834
mistakes.
This was not a merger between two 

127
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:56,550
countries.
This was a complete absorption.

128
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,503
Basically on October 3rd,
1990 East Germany disappeared as an 

129
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:01,224
independent country and became a part of
West Germany as this was definitely a 

130
00:07:05,281 --> 00:07:07,710
good move,
but it did have some downsides

131
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:11,793
reunited at last.
It's like the two states where one once 

132
00:07:15,551 --> 00:07:16,384
more,
but not everything was exactly sunshine 

133
00:07:18,281 --> 00:07:19,114
and rainbows.
Huh?

134
00:07:23,490 --> 00:07:24,323
Or West Germany was extremely wealthy 
and has high productivity and was very 

135
00:07:27,361 --> 00:07:30,120
industrialized.
East Germany was the opposite.

136
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,890
The Soviet controlled state at a lower 
productivity,

137
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,640
less wealth and eight totally different 
political system.

138
00:07:40,730 --> 00:07:42,530
Again,
this was a very similar starting point.

139
00:07:42,531 --> 00:07:45,890
Does that have north and South Korea,
although less extreme,

140
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:46,783
but the process to be successful,
the two states needed to somehow find a 

141
00:07:49,521 --> 00:07:53,090
way to unify that two completely 
different structures.

142
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,030
So now the question probably in your 
mind as well,

143
00:07:55,031 --> 00:07:56,210
what exactly did they do?
Well,

144
00:07:56,211 --> 00:07:59,210
basically West Germany exported all of 
their laws,

145
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:01,900
their taxes and their regulations to 
east German.

146
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:08,603
In exchange,
they also took care of all the 

147
00:08:09,661 --> 00:08:10,494
infrastructure costs.
This means that the western taxpayers 

148
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,120
would pay for the highways,
the railroads,

149
00:08:14,130 --> 00:08:14,963
and the streets of eastern Germany.
And now I know what you're probably 

150
00:08:17,071 --> 00:08:19,290
thinking right now.
This sounds pretty fair,

151
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:19,771
right?
I mean,

152
00:08:19,771 --> 00:08:22,470
if you want to join your poorer neighbor
to create a big country,

153
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,513
you kind of have to help them recover.
But economics is way more complicated 

154
00:08:27,511 --> 00:08:29,790
than just pouring money into something.
Basically,

155
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:34,290
the reunification meant the total 
collapse of the whole eastern economy.

156
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:35,670
And why was this?
Well,

157
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:36,840
just think about it.
I mean,

158
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:37,733
having a single country means having a 
single market to a single market where 

159
00:08:41,071 --> 00:08:44,280
Western companies where several times 
more productive than that,

160
00:08:44,281 --> 00:08:46,620
eastern counterparts,
so east in factories,

161
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:48,570
they just couldn't compete.
For example,

162
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:51,300
East Germany produced the famous travel 
car.

163
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,430
I mean,
compared with a bmw or an Audi,

164
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:56,610
a trevor is just a toy.
So the demand for those cars,

165
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,430
well it just dropped by for day.

166
00:09:01,010 --> 00:09:01,843
Yeah.

167
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:04,220
Many refugees hoping to settle in the 
West,

168
00:09:04,250 --> 00:09:05,083
dump their communists,
built vehicles near the West Germany 

169
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:08,910
embassy in Prague.
Alright,

170
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:12,080
so imagine the situation you work in a 
factory to the company.

171
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:14,630
It has to close because nobody's buying 
their cars.

172
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:17,240
Then you go to the supermarket and 
everything you wanted to buy is produced

173
00:09:17,241 --> 00:09:19,760
in the West because well they have the 
best factories.

174
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:20,653
But then again,
everything is more and more expensive 

175
00:09:22,251 --> 00:09:23,084
because well surprise,
all of a sudden you live in a rich 

176
00:09:24,861 --> 00:09:28,370
country with really high crisis.
This isn't the end of the story here.

177
00:09:28,550 --> 00:09:29,383
I mean imagine you're an old man in the 
east and you get a pension that's 

178
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:34,220
calculated based on the prices during 
communist times,

179
00:09:34,221 --> 00:09:35,054
but that was 1999 you go to the 
[inaudible] and the bread has a western 

180
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,140
price,
which is terrific.

181
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:40,063
Cool.

182
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,040
You can probably see where I'm going 
with this young people,

183
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:48,740
I mean at least they could emigrate and 
believe me they did,

184
00:09:48,950 --> 00:09:52,310
but what could the elderly do?
And just hold on a second now because on

185
00:09:52,311 --> 00:09:54,680
top of all that we have the currency 
exchanges.

186
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:55,553
Do you see the two countries,
they're different currencies with 

187
00:09:57,741 --> 00:09:58,574
different values.
So how did they make it work while the 

188
00:10:00,861 --> 00:10:02,630
finance ministers of eastern and western
Jimmy,

189
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:03,464
they met in a room and they decided on a
fixed exchange rate between the West 

190
00:10:06,950 --> 00:10:07,783
German mark and the East German market.
The public demanded a one to one 

191
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:11,114
exchange and on July the first 1990 the 
banks in the former eastern Germany 

192
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:17,900
provided people with the unbelievable 
exchange rate of one to one.

193
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:26,030
I say this isn't quite marks because the
theory was one thing and the reality was

194
00:10:26,031 --> 00:10:26,864
quite another.
Most of the banks would sell you one 

195
00:10:28,491 --> 00:10:29,324
western mark for two eastern ones.
This is an exchange rate of two to one 

196
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,553
and on the black market,
that exchange rate would be anywhere 

197
00:10:35,091 --> 00:10:38,420
from eight to one to 12 to one.
So from one day to the next,

198
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,250
all the money that you had in your 
savings,

199
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:42,280
we'd lose half of its value.

200
00:10:45,980 --> 00:10:47,150
So when I,
you might be wondering,

201
00:10:47,151 --> 00:10:47,984
well,
what did the German government do to 

202
00:10:48,771 --> 00:10:50,080
manage the situation?
Well,

203
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,000
the answer is subsidies,
subsidies,

204
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:53,953
and our whole palm or subsidies,
west German taxpayers paid medical 

205
00:10:56,871 --> 00:10:58,310
bills,
infrastructure,

206
00:10:58,490 --> 00:10:59,323
and they were doing everything they 
could to prevent eastern Germans from 

207
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:06,170
migrating.
We're talking about almost 70 billion US

208
00:11:06,171 --> 00:11:11,171
dollars every single year since 1990 
that is the equivalent of organizing for

209
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:13,880
Olympic Games.
Every single,

210
00:11:14,150 --> 00:11:15,380
yeah.
Sorry.

211
00:11:15,710 --> 00:11:17,960
Now I know what you're wondering off to 
almost 30 years.

212
00:11:17,961 --> 00:11:18,794
Is this reunification process done?
Can we say that Germany is now an equal 

213
00:11:22,431 --> 00:11:23,480
country?
Well,

214
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,380
the viewer,
the answer is yes and also no,

215
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:35,930
but not mixed.
According to one study,

216
00:11:35,931 --> 00:11:36,764
a good share of German state that they 
wouldn't marry somebody from the other 

217
00:11:39,891 --> 00:11:40,724
Germany,
three quarters of the German population 

218
00:11:42,291 --> 00:11:43,124
thing.
There are still different mentalities 

219
00:11:44,121 --> 00:11:49,121
between the east and the West and 10% of
east Germans have never once traveled to

220
00:11:49,131 --> 00:11:54,131
the other side,
and of course there still differences

221
00:11:54,220 --> 00:11:56,710
in economic terms.
If you look at this chart,

222
00:11:56,711 --> 00:11:58,600
you can see that at the time of 
reunification,

223
00:11:58,601 --> 00:12:03,601
the GDP per capita in the east was 9,400
euros as compares to 22,000

224
00:12:04,451 --> 00:12:05,284
euros in the West.

225
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:11,810
Today it's 27,000
euros and 41,000

226
00:12:11,811 --> 00:12:12,621
years.
Yes,

227
00:12:12,621 --> 00:12:13,454
the differences are more subtle,
but nobody can seriously claim that 

228
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:20,390
there are no differences and of course 
we still have the cultural differences.

229
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,313
A research study done by Jacob 
University in Bremen measured community 

230
00:12:23,541 --> 00:12:24,374
spirit is considering a number of 
factors including trust in institutions 

231
00:12:27,171 --> 00:12:31,280
and tolerance towards the Lgbtq 
community as well as ethnic minorities.

232
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:32,203
All the regions,
the ones made up east Germany appeared 

233
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:36,050
in the bottom half of the index

234
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:42,783
and finally we have the political 
differences that we can see in the 

235
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,873
latest elections.
Eastern Germans voted for afd of far 

236
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:48,874
right wing party and d Linka of far left
wing party while western Germans chose 

237
00:12:52,751 --> 00:12:55,940
more moderate candidates.
This divide in the polls shows house.

238
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:56,783
Still to this day,
eastern Germans are heavily influenced 

239
00:12:58,841 --> 00:12:59,674
by Russian politics.
This is important because one day 

240
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,433
eastern Germans could hijack German 
politics and destroy that sense of gem 

241
00:13:05,591 --> 00:13:06,424
in moderation.
Now going back to the case of North 

242
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,153
Korea,
imagine what would happen if North 

243
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,680
Koreans kept voting for communist 
parties.

244
00:13:11,681 --> 00:13:12,514
I mean all of a sudden you have a leader
like Kim Jong and making decisions that 

245
00:13:15,941 --> 00:13:19,600
also affect South Koreans,
which sounds pretty scary.

246
00:13:19,690 --> 00:13:23,770
Now of course there are many bright 
sides do the German reunification,

247
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:27,040
and as we've mentioned in many of our 
videos here at visual politic,

248
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,500
Germany is still a model for other 
countries.

249
00:13:29,501 --> 00:13:30,334
But as we always say,
not everything is perfect and if there 

250
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:36,990
has to be a Korean reunification,
one day it will not come without.

251
00:13:36,991 --> 00:13:37,100
Yeah.

252
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,100
Risks.
But

253
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:43,283
now it's your turn.
Do you think the eastern Germans could 

254
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:47,060
radicalize the political debates in 
Germany?

255
00:13:47,061 --> 00:13:47,894
Do you still feel the German 
reunification could be a model for the 

256
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:52,543
Korean Peninsula?
