1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
New Zealand's is a remarkable country 
with little more than four and a half 

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:06,720
million inhabitants in a surface area of
268,000

3
00:00:06,721 --> 00:00:09,930
square kilometers.
It is a little bit smaller than Japan or

4
00:00:09,931 --> 00:00:10,764
Italy.
It is located in the South Pacific and 

5
00:00:17,331 --> 00:00:19,670
we could say it in New Zealand is fall 
from,

6
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:20,563
well literally everything because even 
though it feels like it's right near 

7
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:25,394
Australia by looking at the map,
these new countries are separated by 

8
00:00:27,981 --> 00:00:30,320
more than 1000,
600 kilometers.

9
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:31,183
Absent that closest.
This is why we can find that endemic 

10
00:00:33,741 --> 00:00:37,610
species such as the Kiwi and non-flying,
nocturnal birds.

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:41,533
Being such an isolated country,
New Zealand has managed to become the 

12
00:00:43,701 --> 00:00:45,290
following,
a rather unique model.

13
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,610
One of the countries in the welds 
enjoying is one of the highest standards

14
00:00:49,611 --> 00:00:51,080
of living.
In this first video,

15
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:51,914
we're going to tell you about some of 
the most striking keys to New Zealand's 

16
00:00:54,651 --> 00:00:55,484
success.

17
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:06,360
There is an entrepreneur comments or 
feeling if you wish,

18
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:07,194
which takes place over and over again.
Every time someone is asked about New 

19
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:11,603
Zealand's after a visit,
they all sing it as a country of 

20
00:01:13,411 --> 00:01:17,610
congeniality and his quality of life,
that country that everyone seems to want

21
00:01:17,611 --> 00:01:18,444
to go back to you.
I'm happy to say categorically that I 

22
00:01:21,191 --> 00:01:24,780
have found no other country that aligns 
more with my view of the future.

23
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:29,160
The New Zealand Peter Teal,
so if something is for sure,

24
00:01:29,161 --> 00:01:33,270
it is that New Zealand is above all a 
welcoming integrating country.

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:35,690
So how about we look at a piece of 
evidence for that?

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,593
Well,
do you consider this one out of four of 

27
00:01:38,731 --> 00:01:39,564
New Zealand's inhabitants has been 
abroad and here sign language is 

28
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,074
considered an official language.
This isn't certainly have plenty of 

29
00:01:46,201 --> 00:01:49,110
reasons to be happy and more than 
satisfied.

30
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:52,500
Further New Zealand is one of the top 
five safest countries in the world.

31
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:56,550
Its economy is the third freest on the 
entire planet and according to the doing

32
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,384
business ranking,
it is the number one country in the 

33
00:01:59,191 --> 00:02:02,100
world when it comes to the ease of doing
business.

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:03,750
Yep.
You heard that right?

35
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:07,950
New Zealand dethrone Singapore as 
easiest place to do business.

36
00:02:08,010 --> 00:02:10,590
Both for this.
It's not the end of our story today,

37
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,920
not even close.
New Zealand is also considered the least

38
00:02:13,921 --> 00:02:16,440
corrupt country in the world along with 
Denmark.

39
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:19,420
Employment rates here are higher than 
the average and the OACD,

40
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:23,490
and it has excellent educational,
sanitary and cultural systems.

41
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:24,383
In other words,
New Zealand is both an economic and 

42
00:02:26,401 --> 00:02:29,760
social success story,
but leaving all of that aside.

43
00:02:29,761 --> 00:02:30,594
In this video,
we're going to focus on one of the most 

44
00:02:32,341 --> 00:02:36,930
distinctive keys to its success,
and that's the countryside.

45
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:44,210
New Zealand of land a farm using is the 
only developed country where the primary

46
00:02:45,351 --> 00:02:48,500
sector has become more relevant in the 
last three decades.

47
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,670
This sector represents today almost 
seven percent of the country's economy

48
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:56,260
see

49
00:02:56,260 --> 00:02:57,093
highlights.
Just quite how much of this is consider 

50
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,264
the fact that primary sector is just one
point six percent of the economy of the 

51
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:04,863
European Union.
Four Times less than New Zealand's even 

52
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:07,294
Spain who's primary sector represents,
so there's are more than two percent of 

53
00:03:09,551 --> 00:03:10,384
its economy and is considered.
The Orchard of Europe looks pretty 

54
00:03:12,641 --> 00:03:16,150
ridiculous when compared to the country 
that we're discussing today.

55
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:19,840
There is simply no equivalence in the 
entire world.

56
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,733
For example,
milk and dairy here are the largest 

57
00:03:22,541 --> 00:03:24,340
exports from New Zealand.
In fact,

58
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,670
if we add goofy primary sector to the 
Agri food industry,

59
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:32,320
these two represent 60 percent of the 
nation's trade exports.

60
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:46,863
I really thought this could be possible 
that the countryside could be the main 

61
00:03:50,021 --> 00:03:50,854
economic engine in the country with one 
of the best welfare systems and 

62
00:03:53,851 --> 00:03:56,050
standards of living on the entire 
planet.

63
00:03:56,051 --> 00:03:56,884
So it is quite simply rather amazing.
The agricultural competition here is so 

64
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,204
high that they even managed to achieve 
this without having to rely on 

65
00:04:03,881 --> 00:04:06,340
governmental subsidies.
Consider the difference.

66
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,233
Yeah.

67
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:09,493
The European Union grants agriculture 
and livestock subsidies worth around 21 

68
00:04:13,311 --> 00:04:14,150
percent of total

69
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,993
production.

70
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:18,403
The European Union has foreseen that 
they will have to give 55 billion US 

71
00:04:22,381 --> 00:04:25,900
dollars in farming support between the 
years 2014 and 20,

72
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,330
and don't be thinking that the American 
system is any difference now.

73
00:04:31,331 --> 00:04:32,164
All right,
so in North America it subsidies are a 

74
00:04:33,481 --> 00:04:34,314
bit lower than they are in the EU,
but they all still around eight percent 

75
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,320
of all agricultural production.
Well,

76
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:41,610
that's a loss.
Now,

77
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,830
New Zealand does have some government 
subsidies,

78
00:04:43,831 --> 00:04:46,530
but they aren't just zero point nine 
percent of production,

79
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,393
which is 23 times less than the European
Union and to almost 10 times less than 

80
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:53,220
the United States.
Not Bad,

81
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,150
right?
Besides,

82
00:04:54,151 --> 00:04:57,720
if this wasn't enough,
New Zealand spending is mostly bound for

83
00:04:57,721 --> 00:05:02,721
investments and innovation as you can 
seeing thanks to save a great deal,

84
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,590
but this hasn't always been the case.

85
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,930
Roger nomics and the New Zealand or 
farming

86
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:18,003
Lucia

87
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,560
in the early 19 eighties,
almost 40 percent of farming income came

88
00:05:23,561 --> 00:05:26,650
from government subsidies at the time 
the national economy.

89
00:05:26,651 --> 00:05:29,500
It was the archetype of protectionism 
and the system.

90
00:05:29,550 --> 00:05:30,383
Well,
we didn't exactly work the economy over 

91
00:05:32,111 --> 00:05:34,450
the country.
It was going through a tough crisis.

92
00:05:36,190 --> 00:05:37,970
The public

93
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,430
deficit was enormous.
Almost 10 percent of the national GDP.

94
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,293
There was double digit inflation.
The external debt and unemployment kept 

95
00:05:44,851 --> 00:05:47,090
rising and the economy was in a state of
Texas

96
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:49,400
nation.
Now,

97
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,343
in 1984,
the economics minister of the recently 

98
00:05:52,301 --> 00:05:54,280
elected Labor governments,
Roger Douglas,

99
00:05:54,281 --> 00:05:58,760
started and ambitious reform program 
known as Roger Nomix in this program.

100
00:05:58,761 --> 00:05:59,594
At many areas of the economy were 
liberalized and this included the 

101
00:06:01,971 --> 00:06:05,690
primary sector and these changes took 
place almost overnight.

102
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,380
Price controls were eliminated and most 
farming subsidies were removed.

103
00:06:11,690 --> 00:06:13,540
Furthermore,
in order to fight inflation,

104
00:06:13,541 --> 00:06:16,030
the government decided to raise interest
rates.

105
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:19,660
This was really unpopular and farmers 
were angry since they'd gone into debt.

106
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:23,170
In previous years.
It was the perfect storm income falls,

107
00:06:23,171 --> 00:06:24,004
debt interest spending increases,
and there was a fall in the price of 

108
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,570
lands.
As you can imagine,

109
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,630
this change wasn't easy and it all 
seemed to indicate a future disaster.

110
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,593
However,
the country soon felt the benefits of 

111
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:36,784
putting an end to subsidization.
The income fully encouraged farmers to 

112
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,160
look the innovations capable of raising 
the levels of production.

113
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,053
They introduce new crops,
improve the quality of their current 

114
00:06:46,241 --> 00:06:47,074
crops,
and used more ecological farming 

115
00:06:48,491 --> 00:06:49,324
methods.
They simply have to find a way to stand 

116
00:06:51,191 --> 00:06:52,800
out from the crowd.
On the other hand,

117
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,673
they began to be very careful about cost
and it wasn't just about maximizing the 

118
00:06:57,401 --> 00:07:01,210
production of subsidized products.
They had to improve the value chain,

119
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,850
adapt to consumers and reduced costs.

120
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,520
Let's consider an example.
Subsidizing fertilizers.

121
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:07,354
Had resulted in the careless use of them
when there were no more subsidies for 

122
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,164
these fertilizers,
the use of fertilizers fell without 

123
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:16,450
affecting production.
Farmers learns to only use them whenever

124
00:07:16,451 --> 00:07:18,790
necessary,
which helps with the cost of production,

125
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:19,743
but also helps the environment.
The same happens with other things and 

126
00:07:22,421 --> 00:07:23,254
this created a more efficient and 
sustainable agricultural system when we 

127
00:07:26,711 --> 00:07:29,930
consider the new crops and products that
New Zealand started producing.

128
00:07:29,931 --> 00:07:33,550
Theory is probably no better example 
than that of the wine industry.

129
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:36,970
The space dedicated to two vineyards has
almost tripled in the last decade,

130
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:40,120
and New Zealand wine has become known 
around the world.

131
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:42,880
More over with the goal of finding new 
revenue sources.

132
00:07:42,881 --> 00:07:47,620
The rural population started to develop 
additional businesses like rural tourism

133
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:48,454
or elaborate agrifood products,
both closely relying on environmental 

134
00:07:51,431 --> 00:07:52,264
preservation and a highly valued brands.
This meant that the farmers started to 

135
00:08:03,951 --> 00:08:05,800
commit to the protection of the 
environment.

136
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:06,703
Now has realized that preservation of 
the ecosystem was also profitable in 

137
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:12,620
economic terms.
The results of this well,

138
00:08:12,621 --> 00:08:14,540
it was an incredible revolution.

139
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,150
In the end,
only 800 interests,

140
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:19,103
one percent of all of them had to close 
down and in the next 20 years after 

141
00:08:21,841 --> 00:08:25,290
1986,
the production in this sector grew by 40

142
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,124
percent.

143
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,620
Pay Close attention to that figure.
Since the removal of subsidies,

144
00:08:31,621 --> 00:08:35,100
the primary sector has grown more than 
the rest of the economy.

145
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,873
Nineteen 86 and 2006.
The primary sector had sustained growth 

146
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:41,740
of five point nine percent per year.

147
00:08:50,750 --> 00:08:51,510
New Zealand

148
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:54,300
really has thrived after the removal of 
subsidies,

149
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,193
along with this internalization is also 
key and let them Use Zealand's 

150
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:02,160
countryside competitively export more 
than 90 percent of its production.

151
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,023
And in addition to all of that,
it's all incredibly environmentally 

152
00:09:05,401 --> 00:09:06,780
friendly.
So I mean,

153
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:09,830
what else could we possibly ask for New 
Zealand Dfu up?

154
00:09:09,870 --> 00:09:10,703
It's the perfect example of how bad 
policies and subsidization can damage 

155
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:16,140
innovation,
diversification,

156
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:19,620
and productivity,
while at the same time creating a burden

157
00:09:19,621 --> 00:09:20,454
for the public economy.
This is exactly what is happening with 

158
00:09:22,681 --> 00:09:23,514
the CIP,
the European protectionist agricultural 

159
00:09:25,321 --> 00:09:27,530
policy,
which costs around $50,

160
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,930
billion euros every single year.
On the contrary,

161
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:33,270
New Zealand shows that by doing things 
right,

162
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,580
it is not only possible to save a lot of
money,

163
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:39,990
but at the same time it's possible for 
rural areas to improve substantially.

164
00:09:40,050 --> 00:09:40,883
New Zealand has absolutely proven that 
farming can prosper without public aid 

165
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,780
and while New Zealand is trying to 
double that falling exports by 20,

166
00:09:48,781 --> 00:09:50,340
25 for the rest of the country's.

167
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:53,520
I'll still involved in the debate around
subsidization,

168
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:54,443
but that's our opinion here at Fisher 
politic and we'd love to know what you 

169
00:09:56,911 --> 00:09:57,744
think.
Do you think the countryside will die 

170
00:09:59,011 --> 00:10:01,440
without public aid,
New Zealand's success?

171
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,390
Could it be replicated somewhere else?
Well,

172
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:06,540
we'd love to know what you think.

episode,
that one on mine,

and as always,
thank you for.
