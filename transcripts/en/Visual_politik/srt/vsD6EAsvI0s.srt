1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible].

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,973
They're all team types of companies.
Those that sell a product to a customer 

3
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,320
and those where the customer is the 
product.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:15,630
Tinder belongs to the second group.

5
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:22,690
Why would you choose tinder before any 
other dating app?

6
00:00:22,810 --> 00:00:23,460
No,
all the answers.

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,540
That's pretty simple.
It's because it's full of users.

8
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,350
This means that the real product,
it is not a website or a service.

9
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:32,440
Do you have you on tinder,
the product is you,

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:35,200
and here is where the big question comes
in.

11
00:00:35,201 --> 00:00:37,480
How would you start a dating app?
I mean,

12
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,900
imagine you and your friends decide to 
start a company like tinder.

13
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:41,793
Well,
the first thing you need is lots of 

14
00:00:42,551 --> 00:00:43,600
people using it,
right?

15
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:44,434
But these men and women then are going 
to use it if they don't see a lot of 

16
00:00:46,931 --> 00:00:49,900
other men and women using it.
You see where I'm coming from here?

17
00:00:49,990 --> 00:00:50,823
This is why tinder with over 200 million
users is one of the most surprising 

18
00:00:53,981 --> 00:00:58,981
successes in business history.
So how did they get started?

19
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,250
What did they do better than their 
competitors?

20
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:08,580
Well today we're going to answer this 
question and in order to do so,

21
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:11,850
we're going to ask one of the biggest 
experts in the industry,

22
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:14,760
and that's Mark Brooks,
who's the president of idea,

23
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,790
a group that represents the biggest 
dating apps on the planet.

24
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:18,683
He has spent more than 25 years in the 
online love industry and he's also the 

25
00:01:22,591 --> 00:01:25,550
brains behind many of the dating sites 
that you probably know

26
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,680
Hello Simon and the hell is all of 
visual politics subscribers.

27
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:29,543
As you said,
the key to being successful with a 

28
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:34,980
dating service is as we call it,
having a critical mass of activity.

29
00:01:35,010 --> 00:01:35,843
This means having enough active users,
so on average one out of five messages 

30
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:40,134
get an answer.

31
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:45,533
How'd you get there?
This is where economics strategy and 

32
00:01:48,151 --> 00:01:50,790
math comes into play and you might be 
wondering,

33
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:53,770
why are we talking about this on visual 
politics?

34
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:54,623
What does tinder have to do with all of 
the things we usually cover on this 

35
00:01:57,481 --> 00:01:58,470
channel?
Well,

36
00:01:58,590 --> 00:02:01,860
actually a lot.
Listen up in this survey,

37
00:02:01,861 --> 00:02:05,760
one out of five heterosexual couples in 
America got to know each other through a

38
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:08,310
dating site.
In the case of same sex couples,

39
00:02:08,400 --> 00:02:11,490
this figure is more than 70% in other 
words,

40
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,420
dating online has changed our society 
and this,

41
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:18,730
this is also politics nonetheless,
despite what it looks like,

42
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,220
the online dating industry,
there's still a virgin industry.

43
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,083
In total.
We make around $5 billion a year around 

44
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,380
the world,
which isn't that much really relative to

45
00:02:26,381 --> 00:02:28,000
other industries.
For example,

46
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:31,000
the underwear industry has more than 10 
times bigger than the online.

47
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:31,930
Personal is industry.

48
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,100
Yup.
You heard that right?

49
00:02:38,101 --> 00:02:42,100
We're talking about an industry where 
making a profit is seldom easy.

50
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,870
Besides that,
there's a hyper concentrated industry.

51
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:46,670
Basically,
most of the dating sites,

52
00:02:46,671 --> 00:02:47,504
including tinder,
belong to the very same group match 

53
00:02:49,821 --> 00:02:52,370
group.
This is a Nasdaq listed company that has

54
00:02:52,371 --> 00:02:55,220
smashed or required most of the 
competitors at this stage,

55
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:56,150
but still the middle

56
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:01,120
question is how did the tinder creators 
managed to such a successful app?

57
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,983
What kind of lessons can we learn from 
tinder that could be applied to other 

58
00:03:05,081 --> 00:03:05,914
kinds of businesses?
Well today we're going to answer these 

59
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,220
questions,
but before we do,

60
00:03:09,310 --> 00:03:14,310
let's take a look back at the history.
The love,

61
00:03:19,220 --> 00:03:20,690
the Haemus.
I know,

62
00:03:20,691 --> 00:03:25,250
I know it won't come as a surprise if I 
tell you that dating sites are as old as

63
00:03:25,251 --> 00:03:26,084
the Internet itself for a better 
understanding in the year 1991 Tim ben 

64
00:03:29,441 --> 00:03:31,640
is,
he created the first website in history,

65
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:36,730
well three years later,
the first dating site,

66
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:37,583
whether personals was launched.
And as you can imagine we all just 

67
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:42,700
talking about finding your significant 
other at the time.

68
00:03:42,701 --> 00:03:45,640
Other sides like adult friend finder 
where created to

69
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:46,653
nonetheless,
most of these websites were pretty 

70
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,114
rudimentary back then.
Nobody talked about user experience or 

71
00:03:51,581 --> 00:03:55,150
complex algorithms were personal.
So there's just an online version of the

72
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:58,120
good old classified ads that you had an 
newspapers,

73
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:01,000
but you could search more quickly and 
send messages to the contacts,

74
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:04,660
which was huge.
And overall the biggest problem was they

75
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:06,110
had very few users.
Hmm.

76
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:13,550
And most of the cases you would create a
profile and find just a few geeks today.

77
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,580
But all of this changed with the advent 
of match.com match.

78
00:04:21,850 --> 00:04:24,750
The comb was the real game changer that 
make no mistake,

79
00:04:24,751 --> 00:04:27,870
they didn't have an especially good 
algorithm or a better user experience.

80
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,150
In fact,
their asset was just one word.

81
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,373
Money match.com started out with just a 
small improvement over the classified 

82
00:04:40,541 --> 00:04:41,374
ads in newspapers,
but they realize the future was online 

83
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:44,433
during the early years.
They tried different formulas for the 

84
00:04:46,451 --> 00:04:47,284
turning point came in the year 1999 that
was the year when I see a multinational 

85
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:54,550
Bolton mashed or calm for $50 million 
and believe me,

86
00:04:54,551 --> 00:04:56,620
that was enough money to do great 
things.

87
00:04:56,760 --> 00:04:57,593
All of a sudden this company could 
invest heavily in advertising and this 

88
00:05:00,121 --> 00:05:00,954
advertising budget,
let them get to that critical mass 

89
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:05,490
sooner than anybody else,
but not only that.

90
00:05:05,491 --> 00:05:06,324
match.com was the first one to import 
the concepts of the white label to the 

91
00:05:10,561 --> 00:05:15,561
dating world.
So what made match.com so unique?

92
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,034
Well,
they had technology to improve online 

93
00:05:18,331 --> 00:05:20,220
dating,
but what did they need while they needed

94
00:05:20,221 --> 00:05:23,040
more users and who had the most users 
back then?

95
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,700
While that would be msn.com remember old
Microsoft and messenger?

96
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:27,593
Well,
back then this was the most used 

97
00:05:28,861 --> 00:05:29,694
messaging software on the planet.
They were having to offer a brand new 

98
00:05:32,521 --> 00:05:37,521
dating service to their users and this 
is why msn personals was nothing but the

99
00:05:37,561 --> 00:05:40,260
match.com engine with another logo

100
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:42,680
with this aggressive strategy manager 
come close,

101
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:45,540
similar deals with other Internet 
juggernauts like Yahoo.

102
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:48,630
And this is how in so little time they 
smashed the competitors.

103
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:49,500
In fact,
today,

104
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:53,250
this company is so big,
it's listed on the Nasdaq index and they

105
00:05:53,251 --> 00:05:55,410
represent one fifth of the entire 
industry.

106
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,990
Yeah.
[inaudible]

107
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:04,910
I ain't know what you now thinking.
Who could compete with such a ban off at

108
00:06:04,911 --> 00:06:05,744
the end of the day with so much money 
for advertising and the power to close 

109
00:06:08,751 --> 00:06:09,584
the best business deals?
Who could come out from under that 

110
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:13,370
shadow?
Well,

111
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,290
believe me,
the battle,

112
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,180
it had only just started

113
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:19,730
despite mashed up calm being such a big 
company,

114
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,190
the service was pretty lame.
It is true.

115
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:25,040
They had lots of users,
but a minority of people found a natural

116
00:06:25,041 --> 00:06:25,874
match.
This explained why the retention rates 

117
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:28,730
were so low.
In fact,

118
00:06:28,731 --> 00:06:31,970
people signed up into metro con and they
left after just three months.

119
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,590
Most what does satisfied

120
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:38,320
this left a big vacuum for a better 
competitor with a better strategy.

121
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:43,470
And the winning strategy was we do 
promise and over deliver.

122
00:06:47,230 --> 00:06:49,450
Imagine we start a business to make 
money.

123
00:06:49,510 --> 00:06:51,970
The logical move would be to get paid 
for the service.

124
00:06:51,971 --> 00:06:54,580
Right?
Well it doesn't actually have to be that

125
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:56,500
way.
The founders of plenty of fish.

126
00:06:56,540 --> 00:07:01,540
A proofing.
Yeah.

127
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:02,713
2003 this website was the first one to 
offer their services completely for 

128
00:07:06,081 --> 00:07:08,270
free.
So how did they make money?

129
00:07:08,450 --> 00:07:10,010
Well,
the answer that's kind of obvious.

130
00:07:10,011 --> 00:07:11,120
It's bad advertising.

131
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,160
Many of you will not be surprised with 
this,

132
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,000
but back in the time this was a 
revolutionary idea being based on ads.

133
00:07:17,001 --> 00:07:20,810
Plenty of fish was heavily incentivized 
to make sure the users would spend a lot

134
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:23,780
of time on the site.
The longer they use the service,

135
00:07:23,810 --> 00:07:26,150
the more ads they would see.
But this is not

136
00:07:26,180 --> 00:07:29,120
the end of the story.
The strategy of plenty of fish could not

137
00:07:29,121 --> 00:07:32,300
be more counter intuitive.
So here's a question.

138
00:07:32,390 --> 00:07:35,090
Let's say that you're starting your own 
dating site.

139
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,580
What kind of pictures would you put it 
on the front page?

140
00:07:37,581 --> 00:07:41,600
Would you pick ugly or beautiful people?
Would you use an attractive,

141
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,990
elegant web design or a very simple and 
sketchy one?

142
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:50,303
Well,
my guess is you'd go for beautiful 

143
00:07:51,091 --> 00:07:52,890
people in a smart design,
right?

144
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:53,903
Well,
actually plenty of fish did the 

145
00:07:55,171 --> 00:07:56,004
opposite.
Their motto was happy are those with no 

146
00:07:58,111 --> 00:08:01,020
expectations because they will never be 
disappointed.

147
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:03,570
In other words,
under promise and over deliver.

148
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,450
In order to avoid the website taking 
forever to download.

149
00:08:06,451 --> 00:08:08,760
Plenty of fish wander to use low res 
pictures.

150
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:10,590
There's men are very unattractive 
design.

151
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:14,400
They made sure where their users that 
they wouldn't find top models,

152
00:08:14,401 --> 00:08:17,040
but they'd find normal people,
real people,

153
00:08:17,250 --> 00:08:19,950
even their orange made clear that they 
didn't want to lie to anybody.

154
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,340
Plenty of fish,
simple free,

155
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:23,443
and it works.

156
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:27,020
This model was so disruptive that they 
soon found imitators.

157
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,810
Other websites like purdue followed in 
their footsteps.

158
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,690
And guess what happens when plenty of 
fish became successful?

159
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:36,680
Well match.com the ban off of the 
industry does not like competitors,

160
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,930
so they made them an offer they couldn't
refuse.

161
00:08:39,050 --> 00:08:41,990
Basically they did a buy them for what 
the company was worth,

162
00:08:41,991 --> 00:08:42,824
but by the amounts of money,
match.com was losing by having them as 

163
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,680
competitors and well,
it was a lot of money,

164
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:49,783
but many of you might believe that with 
such a solid business model and as a 

165
00:08:52,131 --> 00:08:55,770
part of match.com nobody could take on 
plenty of fish rice.

166
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Well you aren't wrong ones again.
Tindering outside of the box.

167
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,180
Yep.
It's true.

168
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,120
Fancier fish seems like the perfect 
website.

169
00:09:09,121 --> 00:09:10,830
Millions of users,
simple design,

170
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:13,830
happy customers.
But there was a problem.

171
00:09:14,010 --> 00:09:17,640
It didn't work on mobile phones and as 
if this wasn't enough and everything was

172
00:09:17,641 --> 00:09:20,040
proud of the fact that they were using 
plenty of fish.

173
00:09:20,070 --> 00:09:20,903
Now I know this is probably going to 
surprise the millennials watching this 

174
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:24,660
video,
but until recently,

175
00:09:24,661 --> 00:09:28,720
the online dating industry was kind of a
pretty shameful pastime.

176
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:31,440
And the last thing that you'd confessed 
to your friends,

177
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:34,580
and this is when the tinder founders 
came in ready to change the rules of the

178
00:09:34,581 --> 00:09:35,414
game forever.
Tinder was the first dating APP design 

179
00:09:39,891 --> 00:09:42,980
that we've fully mobile first.
No computers or laptops,

180
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:43,903
just cell phones.
And how do you think they got what that 

181
00:09:46,341 --> 00:09:47,900
critical mass of users?
Well,

182
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:49,700
you might think that being an internet 
app,

183
00:09:49,701 --> 00:09:51,620
they use online ads to promote 
themselves.

184
00:09:51,621 --> 00:09:53,960
Right.
So the opposite was true.

185
00:09:56,530 --> 00:09:56,960
Okay.

186
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,793
The strategy of tinder was 100% offline 
instead of ads or big marketing 

187
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:03,860
campaigns.
The tinder founders organized parties at

188
00:10:03,861 --> 00:10:04,694
American universities more.
Exactly the coolest fraternities and 

189
00:10:07,971 --> 00:10:08,804
sororities.
If you wanted to attend to the most 

190
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:11,114
glamorous parties,
you had to download the APP to your 

191
00:10:12,711 --> 00:10:15,440
mobile phone and it wasn't sold as a 
dating APP.

192
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,090
In fact,
it was a game.

193
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,053
In fact,
the goal of the 10 to founders was not 

194
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,060
to sell true level of significant 
others.

195
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:23,220
The motto was,
we are playing tinder.

196
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,293
Let's play and see who is the most 
popular in the party would have put it 

197
00:10:26,581 --> 00:10:27,414
on their own terms.
Let's see who gets the biggest share of 

198
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:30,393
life.

199
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:36,610
The idea of competing for popularity was
nothing new.

200
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,473
Mother websites like hot or not offered 
people the chance to upload their 

201
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,594
pictures so others could rank them from 
zero to 10 but tins are made everything 

202
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,150
simpler.
It wasn't about ranking,

203
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:46,984
but instead it was a matter of yes or no
or in tinder towns swipe right or swipe 

204
00:10:51,971 --> 00:10:52,804
left

205
00:10:56,140 --> 00:10:56,973
often does real success can be explained
with the theories at the so called 

206
00:10:59,701 --> 00:11:00,534
behavioral economist.
Authors like Daniel Conaman talk about 

207
00:11:03,031 --> 00:11:05,220
two kinds of behavior,
some of the basics

208
00:11:05,310 --> 00:11:10,310
in NATO operations functions that we 
have such as perceiving things,

209
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:16,040
having emotional reactions to things.
All this is system one.

210
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,200
We don't choose what just happens to us.

211
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:20,373
The so called system one or intuitive 
fast decision making and the so called 

212
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:26,950
system to all logical and slow decision 
making.

213
00:11:27,130 --> 00:11:30,790
By limiting the range of choices,
we can easily approach people's emotions

214
00:11:30,900 --> 00:11:31,733
easier.
So tend to dumb down decision making to 

215
00:11:33,161 --> 00:11:34,950
the purest emotional element element.

216
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:36,990
In other words,
mobile first design,

217
00:11:36,991 --> 00:11:40,300
gamification and perfect expansion 
strategy made at tinder,

218
00:11:40,330 --> 00:11:42,750
the most loved APP in American 
universities.

219
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:45,540
Instead of hiding it,
people told everybody they were using it

220
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,460
and at the end of the day it wasn't 
dating.

221
00:11:47,461 --> 00:11:49,680
It was a game.
They were playing tinder,

222
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:52,950
and guess what happens after tinder 
achieved so much success.

223
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:57,370
Exactly.
Again,

224
00:11:57,371 --> 00:12:00,610
match.com the lovebam off bought them.
In other words,

225
00:12:00,611 --> 00:12:03,400
most of the dating apps today,
a part of the very same group,

226
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:08,430
and this is why we can still say the 
story doesn't end here after 25 years,

227
00:12:11,841 --> 00:12:12,674
the dating app industry is still taking 
baby steps and this is because it's one 

228
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:20,000
of the few businesses where people 
success is punished instead of rewarded.

229
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:28,420
Think about it.
What would be the best app for dating?

230
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,613
Of course,
the one that lets you find your 

231
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:31,840
significant other,
right?

232
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,000
Nonetheless,
if you find your match on tinder,

233
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,010
the next thing you'll do is leave the 
APP.

234
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:39,310
This way the company stops making money,
which is crazy.

235
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,413
In other words,
the incentive for a dating app is quite 

236
00:12:42,071 --> 00:12:42,904
broken.
If they can help you find your true 

237
00:12:44,501 --> 00:12:46,930
love,
then you're off never to return.

238
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:47,873
In economic terms,
this means the dating app market is far 

239
00:12:50,101 --> 00:12:50,934
from mature.
There's still a lot of space for new 

240
00:12:53,041 --> 00:12:53,874
players.

241
00:12:57,870 --> 00:12:58,703
For example,
one of the tinder craze has left the 

242
00:12:59,731 --> 00:13:01,890
company after a sexual harassment 
lawsuit.

243
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:03,930
She created her own app called the 
bumble.

244
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:07,980
This APP is completely innovative 
because here women are the ones who must

245
00:13:07,981 --> 00:13:09,030
send the first message.

246
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,163
Okay.

247
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,440
And of course there's also facebook.
Yep.

248
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,333
You heard me right?
Facebook has already announced they 

249
00:13:16,721 --> 00:13:18,370
would have launched their own dating 
site.

250
00:13:18,670 --> 00:13:22,780
They have the information that Melville 
users and the money to make a 180 degree

251
00:13:22,781 --> 00:13:25,840
shift to an industry that despite having
millions of users,

252
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:28,360
makes them less than $5 billion a year.

253
00:13:33,570 --> 00:13:33,910
Wow.

254
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:34,743
So now it's your turn.
Do you think facebook will be a rival 

255
00:13:36,551 --> 00:13:37,384
for tinder or match.com do you think 
online dating will become the preferred 

256
00:13:40,511 --> 00:13:42,670
way of finding your significant other?
