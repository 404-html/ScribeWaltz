1
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:11,210
But if you have asked us to make a video
about the Mexican elections,

2
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:15,080
which are arguably the most important in
the history of Mexico,

3
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,140
but why all these elections so 
important?

4
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:19,033
Well,
that's because this might be the first 

5
00:00:19,791 --> 00:00:24,680
time in the history of Mexico that we 
say goodbye to by partisan politics,

6
00:00:27,230 --> 00:00:28,063
election polls,
Lopez Obrador is 10 point nine points 

7
00:00:31,100 --> 00:00:34,310
above his biggest rival.
But hold on a minute here because Mexico

8
00:00:34,340 --> 00:00:36,560
isn't even actually a bipartisan 
country.

9
00:00:36,561 --> 00:00:37,394
In fact,
Mexico has had the same political party 

10
00:00:39,081 --> 00:00:41,300
in governments.
Five or 70 years.

11
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,390
Yep.
You heard that right from 1930 until the

12
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:45,223
year 2000.
Every Mexican president belongs to the 

13
00:00:49,850 --> 00:00:51,560
Institutional Revolution Party.
Also known as P,

14
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,580
R I from their Spanish acronym and yeah,
I know what you're thinking.

15
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,640
How can you be a revolutionary and 
institutional at the same time?

16
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:05,680
Well,
nobody really knows,

17
00:01:05,681 --> 00:01:08,050
but that's the name of the party got.
Theoretically,

18
00:01:08,051 --> 00:01:10,690
pri is a sense of left wing party or 
they.

19
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:11,543
Many Mexicans would say that just a 
casual party with no clear ideology or 

20
00:01:15,641 --> 00:01:16,474
identity.
The only simply their lust for power 

21
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:21,730
still for 70 years,
PRI was winning.

22
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:26,020
Every election after the year,
2000 Mexicans took a 12 year hiatus from

23
00:01:26,021 --> 00:01:29,200
pri with the conservative and National 
Action Party,

24
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:32,470
also known as pan.
Then in 2012,

25
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:36,340
the PRI struck back and one of the 
presidency with Enrique Kenya.

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:37,223
Yes sir.
A guy who now holds the title of 

27
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:39,853
Mexico's most hated president ever,
and that is why right now with Mexico 

28
00:01:44,201 --> 00:01:45,034
about to hold these game changing 
elections on June the first John says 

29
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:53,080
that neither the Pri and all the here 
and we'll win office.

30
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:56,530
The front runner is this man here,
Andres Manuel Lopez,

31
00:01:56,590 --> 00:01:57,423
Obrador.

32
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:02,860
Then a worried by the Lopez Obrador 
economic agenda.

33
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:06,850
This is the third time he's run for 
office and it might be the final time,

34
00:02:07,090 --> 00:02:10,780
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador,
as Mexicans knew him,

35
00:02:10,870 --> 00:02:11,703
and Lo has policies that,
to put it mildly scap verse out of 

36
00:02:15,191 --> 00:02:19,060
business people and foreign investors,
some people argue the Mexico might be on

37
00:02:19,061 --> 00:02:19,894
the brink of becoming the new Venezuela 
there if they choose a populist 

38
00:02:22,691 --> 00:02:24,430
politician like him.
Nonetheless,

39
00:02:24,431 --> 00:02:27,820
his worst enemy is not businessmen.
It's actually himself.

40
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,713
His public statements are scaring away 
all the moderate voters and that is a 

41
00:02:32,501 --> 00:02:35,470
problem because they could direct all of
this and um,

42
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,980
sentiment towards one of the other 
candidate.

43
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:43,043
That's,
that's today's questions are why can 

44
00:02:44,681 --> 00:02:45,514
ambula win this election and all that 
legitimate reasons to be scared of his 

45
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:50,134
presidency feather.
We also want to look at were there any 

46
00:02:51,761 --> 00:02:54,580
other kinds of data could really 
overshadow him in the election?

47
00:02:54,670 --> 00:02:55,330
Well,
today,

48
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:56,163
good news.
We're going to answer all of those 

49
00:02:56,681 --> 00:02:57,790
questions,
but before we do,

50
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:58,713
let's take a look back at the big 
Mexican disappointment at the beginning 

51
00:03:07,021 --> 00:03:07,854
of the 21st century it seems like in 
Mexico was taking no prisoners with 

52
00:03:11,911 --> 00:03:15,150
plenty of natural resources like oil and
Silva.

53
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:19,620
Mexico was one of the most appreciated 
emerging economies in 2010.

54
00:03:19,621 --> 00:03:23,700
The country's GDP growth rate of five 
point five cents.

55
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:24,623
Nonetheless,
just like the other emerging economies 

56
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:31,220
of Brazil and South Africa,
Mexico went from hero to zero in 2016

57
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,563
can GDP.
In US dollars is at its worst level 

58
00:03:38,821 --> 00:03:40,710
since 2010.
This is the pricing.

59
00:03:40,711 --> 00:03:41,544
If we take into account that Mexico has 
countless opportunities to become a 

60
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:45,930
wealthy nation,
they have oil,

61
00:03:45,931 --> 00:03:49,890
a good climate for agriculture and all 
kinds of natural resources,

62
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,320
and even more importantly than those 
things,

63
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:54,660
they share a border with America.
As you know,

64
00:03:54,661 --> 00:03:57,090
Nafta is a trade agreement between 
Mexico,

65
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,560
the USA and Canada,
and say 80 percent of Mexican exports go

66
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:04,020
to Uncle Sam.
Despite all of this,

67
00:04:04,021 --> 00:04:04,854
Mexico is still a mid level income 
country with low wages and a much lower 

68
00:04:09,631 --> 00:04:11,350
quality of life than it's northern 
native.

69
00:04:15,470 --> 00:04:16,640
You might be wondering,
well,

70
00:04:16,641 --> 00:04:17,474
why is this well off to 70 years of a 
basically one party system with 

71
00:04:20,961 --> 00:04:22,820
corruption and drug trafficking going 
on?

72
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,833
Mexico has almost medieval institutions 
and I know you're probably thinking 

73
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:28,491
right now.
You're thinking,

74
00:04:28,491 --> 00:04:30,440
oh,
Simon's exaggerating again.

75
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,303
Well,
how about you judge for yourself until 

76
00:04:32,691 --> 00:04:33,524
the year 2016?
That judicial system had no presumption 

77
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:39,080
of innocence,
so that wasn't even a need for evidence.

78
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,630
In order to convict someone.
In many cases,

79
00:04:41,631 --> 00:04:42,464
a confession obtained through torture 
would be more than enough to send 

80
00:04:45,801 --> 00:04:48,440
someone to jail is fitting this academic
school.

81
00:04:48,441 --> 00:04:49,274
This,
the inquisitorial judicial system added 

82
00:04:51,341 --> 00:04:52,174
this to the drug trafficking,
which has already killed more than 

83
00:04:53,571 --> 00:04:56,300
200,000 people in just 11 years

84
00:04:58,760 --> 00:04:59,593
for

85
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:02,100
better understanding in some areas of 
Mexico,

86
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,650
narcos have more power than the state 
itself,

87
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:05,603
and political sciences is called a 
failed state situation and this happens 

88
00:05:08,341 --> 00:05:11,640
in many areas of Africa and in Mexico.
In other words,

89
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:12,533
Mexica needed more than reforms.
It needed a 180 degree turn arounds for 

90
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:20,970
its institutions as well.
Who was the man for this job?

91
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,410
Well,
of course that would be henrique a pen.

92
00:05:23,411 --> 00:05:24,244
Yeah,
NASA.

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,450
That his job was to do this when he got 
into office in 2012.

94
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,313
The problem is that it's still too early
for Mexicans to notice improvements in 

95
00:05:31,021 --> 00:05:33,030
their day to day lives after the 
reforms.

96
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
In fact,
social unrest in Mexico,

97
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,540
it actually keeps growing

98
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,900
and you can add to that the thanks that 
Kenya and yet says,

99
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:44,980
worst enemy is actually opinion yet so 
himself.

100
00:05:45,190 --> 00:05:46,023
Few people have worked harder to damage 
that credibility basically has 

101
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:54,040
everything.
One needs to become a hated politician.

102
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:54,903
Corruption scandals,
a fake phd size and lots of 

103
00:05:58,311 --> 00:05:59,144
embezzlement,
but this apparently wasn't enough for 

104
00:06:00,651 --> 00:06:01,484
him.
Do you remember Donald Trump's election 

105
00:06:02,241 --> 00:06:03,074
campaign and you probably do.
He was messing with Mexico every other 

106
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:06,410
day.
As you can imagine,

107
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,350
Mexicans,
they're not big fans of trump because of

108
00:06:09,351 --> 00:06:10,160
this.
Well,

109
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:13,510
Kenya is brilliant.
Idea was to invite trump for an official

110
00:06:13,511 --> 00:06:14,344
visit even before he became the 
president and you can probably guess 

111
00:06:21,711 --> 00:06:22,544
what the reaction of the Mexican people 
was and then we got to consider the war 

112
00:06:25,221 --> 00:06:28,400
on drugs.
Festy jailed El Chapo Guzman who was the

113
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,220
Mexican version of Pablo Escobar.
After that,

114
00:06:31,221 --> 00:06:33,510
El Chapo escaped from jail via written 
all over.

115
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:35,810
It was so well built.
It was obvious.

116
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:39,380
It received help from the police.
Say to sum things up,

117
00:06:39,381 --> 00:06:44,381
Kenya is the man.
People love to hate a survey in Mexico.

118
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:49,830
Pentagon,
the anthro is the Mexican president with

119
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:52,920
the worst approval rating of all time.
In other words,

120
00:06:52,921 --> 00:06:53,754
Kenya and Yetta and administration 
epitomizes the public's ultimate 

121
00:06:56,391 --> 00:06:59,120
disappointments with the Mexican ruling 
class.

122
00:06:59,270 --> 00:07:03,920
So Pri is not to be trusted.
Pa and is not very exciting either.

123
00:07:04,010 --> 00:07:07,010
So the traditional candidates and not 
really an option anymore.

124
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:08,750
So I mean,
what's left?

125
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:11,170
Well,
this is where I'm low,

126
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,073
comes in,

127
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,660
um,
low.

128
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,493
There was a time when emily was a member
of the PRI policy that was in the 19 

129
00:07:19,621 --> 00:07:20,454
seventies,
but this institutional revolutionary 

130
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:26,000
party was already more institutional 
than revolutionary.

131
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:29,220
Then that's why I'm.
I left them and created the party of his

132
00:07:29,221 --> 00:07:31,890
own,
the Democratic Revolutionary Party,

133
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:36,360
the stronghold of the true Mexican left.
As you can imagine,

134
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:41,361
defeating the PRI was mission impossible
in Sylvia thousands that yet brought the

135
00:07:41,881 --> 00:07:44,910
big crash of the biggest Mexican potty.
For one,

136
00:07:44,911 --> 00:07:48,510
they lost the presidency to the 
Conservatives for another,

137
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,850
they lost the mayor of the city of 
Mexico to unload.

138
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,033
Becoming the leader of the biggest 
metropolol all across Latin America is 

139
00:08:00,071 --> 00:08:00,904
not a small deal.
You get a great showcase for your 

140
00:08:02,561 --> 00:08:04,990
policies,
and this is why six years later,

141
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:05,913
I'm low,
almost won the presidency of the 

142
00:08:06,881 --> 00:08:07,690
country.
I say,

143
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,523
what do you do when you almost win a 
national election and have become the 

144
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:13,690
new left wing Rockstar?
Well,

145
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:14,553
you accused the government of election 
fraud and organized lots of 

146
00:08:16,961 --> 00:08:20,470
demonstrations on the streets and the 
let your followers name you fee,

147
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:24,390
legitimate presidents and family almost 
winds this time around.

148
00:08:24,630 --> 00:08:25,463
All of this could happen again.
I said in a democracy you can win and 

149
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,460
you can lose,
but this was not a democracy.

150
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:40,060
Clearly the selection was unfair and 
full of irregularities.

151
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:46,040
He does,
he of,

152
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:52,690
but now we know his history.
Let's have a look at his policies.

153
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:53,553
Basically,
Angelo wants to undo all of the made by 

154
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,500
previous presidents.
How about some examples?

155
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:00,150
Well,
here we have the energy,

156
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,170
though.
Prior to this little,

157
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,960
all next oil was managed by these state 
company.

158
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,973
Pemex.
This company itself suffered big losses 

159
00:09:06,511 --> 00:09:07,344
and we'll kinds of corruption cases and 
yet and yet so and his energy bill 

160
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:14,460
wanted to end this monopoly so foreign 
companies could invest in the country as

161
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:15,870
a result.
Short term wise,

162
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:19,560
gasoline prices went sky high in just a 
few months.

163
00:09:24,940 --> 00:09:28,600
Timely wants to try and solve the 
problem by giving back to the way things

164
00:09:28,601 --> 00:09:31,180
were before.
The same goes for the education bill.

165
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,103
Prior to the current Ceville teachers' 
unions held a lot of sway over public 

166
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:35,674
education.
The result was lots of protests 

167
00:09:37,091 --> 00:09:39,820
organized by those teachers unions,
and again,

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:40,833
I'm low,
wants to go backwards and make those 

169
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,010
teachers happy.
And what about drug trafficking?

170
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,590
Well,
Emily's plans don't stop with ending the

171
00:09:47,591 --> 00:09:49,870
war on drugs,
which could be kind of reasonable.

172
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,990
He wants to provide amnesty for the big 
drug kingpin is so called dangerous.

173
00:09:56,231 --> 00:09:59,830
Criminals are mere babies compared to 
the corrupt politicians,

174
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:04,660
but the best of his policies,
what we like to call his magic tricks.

175
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,060
For example,
how do we end corruption symbol?

176
00:10:07,061 --> 00:10:11,500
We write a so called moral constitution 
and remove the illegal immunity that the

177
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:12,363
members of parliaments currently enjoy.
This one is especially funny because 

178
00:10:15,221 --> 00:10:16,054
it's not exactly the first time that a 
politician has connected those two 

179
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,090
principles of corruption and legal 
immunity and guess what?

180
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:24,310
The least corrupt countries on the 
planet,

181
00:10:24,410 --> 00:10:27,790
Denmark and New Zealand's have legal 
immunity for them,

182
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,440
members of parliament.
Then again,

183
00:10:29,441 --> 00:10:30,274
it does seem like a very appealing 
policy for populist politicians 

184
00:10:32,891 --> 00:10:33,724
worldwide.

185
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:38,873
Anyway.
I'm like basically seems to have easy 

186
00:10:40,411 --> 00:10:43,230
and quick solutions for everything.
So the more examples,

187
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:44,700
well,
youth unemployment easy,

188
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,563
the government will employ thousands of 
youngsters and so on and so forth with 

189
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:53,190
other such examples and other words and 
low and his brand new political party,

190
00:10:53,191 --> 00:10:58,191
the so called marina generates a lot of 
sympathy in half of Mexico society and a

191
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,484
lot of fear in the other half.
And this is a problem because if you 

192
00:11:02,221 --> 00:11:03,054
want to run for office scattering,
your enemies might galvanize them on 

193
00:11:05,671 --> 00:11:06,504
election day.
So the real question now is to what 

194
00:11:08,761 --> 00:11:12,300
extent is Amarillo willing to moderate 
his agenda,

195
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,320
popular

196
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,270
or populist?
Remember this name,

197
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:21,253
Alfonso Romo.
He's a big businessman in Monterrey and 

198
00:11:23,841 --> 00:11:27,110
has been hazed by amyloid to become the 
campaign spokesperson.

199
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,700
So what's his mission?
Well,

200
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:29,563
he's the man in charge of moderating 
ambulance policies and making them more 

201
00:11:32,781 --> 00:11:36,080
palatable for independent voters.
With all the polls in his favor,

202
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,923
amyloid needs those votes badly.
And Alfonso Aroma is the man for the 

203
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,474
job.
He comes from the business wells and 

204
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,290
supported conservative candidates in the
past.

205
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,273
In fact,
many of emily's advisors come from 

206
00:11:47,691 --> 00:11:50,750
different backgrounds,
including the conservative Pan Party.

207
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,380
And you can really tell that they are 
softening rhetoric,

208
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,233
right?

209
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:59,520
Remember how I told you that emily 
wanted to revoke the energy bill?

210
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,410
Well now with phones,
say Roman was essentially said,

211
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:02,333
look guys,
it wasn't so that at the end of the day 

212
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:05,153
we'll just renegotiate the contracts 
with foreign companies that they can 

213
00:12:08,101 --> 00:12:08,934
stay in the country.
I'm low changed as mine and now he says 

214
00:12:13,961 --> 00:12:14,794
yes to energy,
openness according to our funds or 

215
00:12:17,181 --> 00:12:19,450
Oromo,
but there's still a lot more last minute

216
00:12:19,451 --> 00:12:20,620
moderation.
For example,

217
00:12:20,621 --> 00:12:22,240
Angela is from region,
Coles,

218
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:24,930
Tabasco here and the other is a kind of 
fish cold pack.

219
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,950
And that's why some people live in,
nicknamed him the pain.

220
00:12:27,010 --> 00:12:30,670
So now in order to give the impression 
that he will not nationalized companies,

221
00:12:30,671 --> 00:12:34,090
raised taxes or expropriate properties 
in Venezuela and fashion,

222
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:37,900
he's launched a brand new economic 
agenda called payer nomics.

223
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:44,380
No money is a big fan of risks and 
experiments.

224
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:45,303
And with or without flashy names,
Mexican businessman doesn't really 

225
00:12:47,591 --> 00:12:48,370
trust.
I'm like,

226
00:12:48,370 --> 00:12:51,100
this is why while the elections are 
getting closer and closer,

227
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,140
this group has already found it's 
canceled.

228
00:12:56,290 --> 00:12:57,123
DEB's against this Mexico and like other
countries like France has no second 

229
00:13:00,191 --> 00:13:02,230
rounds during the presidential 
elections.

230
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,183
That means that the candidate with the 
biggest share of the voters on July the 

231
00:13:06,221 --> 00:13:07,054
first will become the presidents,
and this is why it seems that the 

232
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,210
biggest antagonist to Amarillo is going 
to be the conservative candidates,

233
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:14,440
Ricardo and Naya,

234
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,073
the Mexican business elite,
will support in order to stop Lopez 

235
00:13:21,710 --> 00:13:25,250
Obrador being 39 years old,
and I was the youngest candidate in this

236
00:13:25,251 --> 00:13:27,140
election.
He's been accused of money laundering,

237
00:13:27,141 --> 00:13:29,660
but this hasn't actually hurt him during
the campaign.

238
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,430
In fact,
quite the opposite is true.

239
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:32,323
People believe that this was just a 
dirty trick played by the PRI to 

240
00:13:34,881 --> 00:13:35,714
disqualify him.
Seven dd is gaining momentum in the 

241
00:13:37,221 --> 00:13:38,054
polls,
although he still has a long way to go 

242
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,030
in order to pass ambler.

243
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:44,663
So now the big question is,
do you believe amyloid will become the 

244
00:13:46,381 --> 00:13:49,860
next Mexican presidents and neither can 
actually beat him?

245
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,540
Is amyloid risks to Mexico or is it hard
to do worse than previous presidents?

246
00:13:54,570 --> 00:13:55,403
