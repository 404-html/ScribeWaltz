1
00:00:02,370 --> 00:00:05,800
We had the Roman Empire,
the Spanish and the British empire.

2
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:07,780
Now we live in the age of the American 
mm.

3
00:00:12,550 --> 00:00:13,383
No,
the country has had such a military 

4
00:00:14,231 --> 00:00:15,064
presence in so many places,
even in remote places like Guam in the 

5
00:00:17,921 --> 00:00:18,754
middle of the Pacific,
America has a military base and that's 

6
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:21,850
actually pretty useful

7
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,690
that you can buy a mobile phone made in 
South Korea with just one click.

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:30,813
That's the outcome of global capitalism,
but also global capitalism would not be 

9
00:00:34,311 --> 00:00:37,970
possible if trade wasn't safe.
Those American bases there,

10
00:00:37,971 --> 00:00:41,630
there to protect those ships that move 
goods from one place to another,

11
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:45,980
and this is really the reason why the US
invest so much in having a strong army,

12
00:00:45,981 --> 00:00:49,280
which has kind of been unchallenged 
until now.

13
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:50,163
So now you might be wondering or you 
might not be who is challenging this 

14
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:55,920
empire because of course it's shine up 
and swell.

15
00:00:55,970 --> 00:00:57,470
How is trying to doing this?
Well,

16
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:59,210
that's what we're going to see in this 
video.

17
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:10,490
This is the million dollar question.
Why does America have such a big army?

18
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:12,830
You might argue that it doesn't really 
need one.

19
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:13,753
In fact that just by looking at a map,
you can see that America has a big 

20
00:01:16,790 --> 00:01:17,623
advantage.
It's secured by two fairly sizable 

21
00:01:20,061 --> 00:01:23,060
oceans,
making it almost impossible to attack or

22
00:01:23,061 --> 00:01:28,061
invade.
Nonetheless,

23
00:01:29,111 --> 00:01:31,840
America has the biggest army on the 
planet.

24
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:32,943
It has more than a million active 
military personnel and almost 800 

25
00:01:36,551 --> 00:01:39,400
military bases located in 70 different 
countries.

26
00:01:39,430 --> 00:01:41,680
Territories all over the globe,
risen,

27
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,520
France and Russia by contrast have about
34 and bases combined.

28
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:50,763
Just have a look at this map.
America is all over the place and there 

29
00:01:54,281 --> 00:01:56,700
is no country that can challenge them.
Well,

30
00:01:56,710 --> 00:01:59,050
hold on a second because maybe there is.
Yes,

31
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,920
you have us.
Today we're talking all about Schneider.

32
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:02,710
Errol,
visitable.

33
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,610
I think we've talked to thousands of 
times about China's economic progress.

34
00:02:06,670 --> 00:02:10,030
It's the world's factory and many 
Chinese companies are starting to become

35
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,450
big competition for the technological 
bandits,

36
00:02:13,510 --> 00:02:16,810
but now we're talking about then 
military more specifically than military

37
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:19,900
presence in the south China Sea,
and believe me,

38
00:02:19,901 --> 00:02:20,734
this is no

39
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:21,593
joke.

40
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:29,240
China,
south China Sea play the end of peaceful

41
00:02:29,241 --> 00:02:30,074
rise.
The definition string of pearls was 

42
00:02:31,821 --> 00:02:32,654
first used in 2005 in an international 
report given by the Department of 

43
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:38,270
Defense of the United States.
In this report,

44
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:42,770
it was predicted that China will try to 
expand its naval presence throughout the

45
00:02:42,770 --> 00:02:44,090
Indian Ocean region.
In this context,

46
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,953
the polls are a metaphor for each of the
military bases that China wants to 

47
00:02:47,811 --> 00:02:48,644
build,
making a string that goes all the way 

48
00:02:50,451 --> 00:02:51,284
down to Africa and the Middle East where
China imports most of its natural 

49
00:02:54,651 --> 00:02:58,190
resources and as you can imagine,
these military extensions,

50
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:01,150
they scanned the wells,
especially America,

51
00:03:01,210 --> 00:03:03,370
and they got even more scary when the 
former trainees,

52
00:03:03,371 --> 00:03:06,730
President Hu Jintao,
sent this in 2009

53
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:09,950
the road.

54
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,793
The peaceful development is a strategic 
choice made by the Chinese government 

55
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:17,850
and people in the line of the nations 
peace loving traditional culture.

56
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:18,713
The trend of our times and the 
fundamental interests of China who 

57
00:03:21,811 --> 00:03:22,560
gentle.

58
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,670
Yeah,
so for some reason,

59
00:03:23,671 --> 00:03:24,504
this quote that was intended to chill 
out via Americans basically had the 

60
00:03:26,971 --> 00:03:27,804
opposite effect because it pretty much 
sounded like China was saying the 

61
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,900
opposite of what is actually the truth.
But okay,

62
00:03:33,901 --> 00:03:35,160
I know what you're probably thinking 
right now.

63
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:36,270
I mean,
so what?

64
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,900
What was the problem with China trying 
to increase their military after all,

65
00:03:39,901 --> 00:03:40,734
it's just another country.
Everyone has an army and wants to be 

66
00:03:43,321 --> 00:03:44,700
safe rice.
I mean,

67
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,310
why should we care about China having 
military basis?

68
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:50,190
Do they really want to surpass the 
United States?

69
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,720
Can they even?
Well,

70
00:03:51,721 --> 00:03:53,490
today we're going to answer all of those
questions,

71
00:03:53,491 --> 00:03:55,650
but before we do,
as we always do,

72
00:03:55,830 --> 00:04:00,830
let's take a look back at the history 
lessons from the pain.

73
00:04:03,030 --> 00:04:05,880
We said America is almost impossible to 
invade.

74
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,000
Whilst there was an exception,
and that was in the year 1941,

75
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:11,970
when Japan bombed Pearl Harbor in 
Hawaii,

76
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:16,343
a year later,
the Japanese invaded the Aleutian 

77
00:04:17,491 --> 00:04:21,330
islands in Alaska.
That was the moment when America learned

78
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,150
an important lesson.
Nobody is 100 percent safe.

79
00:04:24,210 --> 00:04:25,043
It was also the time that they figured 
they should probably care about 

80
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:28,110
protecting the oceans.
In fact,

81
00:04:28,111 --> 00:04:28,944
during World War Two,
the US had to fight among lots of small 

82
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:31,614
islands in the Pacific.
This was the case during the battle of 

83
00:04:33,361 --> 00:04:34,194
midway after the attack on Pearl Harbor,
the Japanese trying to eliminate the US 

84
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:41,730
as a strategic power in the Pacific and 
they hope to succeed by demoralizing the

85
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:44,070
American forces with another surprise 
attack,

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:44,993
American cryptographers.
They managed to decipher the date and 

87
00:04:47,011 --> 00:04:50,700
the location of Japan's attack and 
prepared a surprise counterattack.

88
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:51,623
Needless to say,
the US inflicted irreparable damage to 

89
00:04:54,001 --> 00:04:55,980
the Japanese fleet.
World War Two ended.

90
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:58,590
The Americans won and they remembered 
that lesson.

91
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,860
We can't let this happen again.
Sorry.

92
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:07,130
Well,
what did they do?

93
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:08,023
Well,
they covered the Pacific Ocean with 

94
00:05:09,411 --> 00:05:10,244
military basis.
Basically they kept soldiers on those 

95
00:05:12,351 --> 00:05:16,040
small islands where they had fought and 
how you might be wondering,

96
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:16,874
well,
why is it so important to have soldiers 

97
00:05:18,021 --> 00:05:20,570
on a small island?
No one really cares about.

98
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:21,463
I mean,
is it really that bad if someone wants 

99
00:05:22,731 --> 00:05:24,440
to invade an asshole,
like midway,

100
00:05:24,441 --> 00:05:25,274
I mean really and also moving soldiers 
to the other side of the planet and 

101
00:05:28,041 --> 00:05:30,170
keeping them that it's not exactly 
cheap.

102
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,140
Worship is basically a floating city 
with big guns on it.

103
00:05:37,230 --> 00:05:41,380
It's a city that can move travel 500 to 
a thousand kilometers in one day,

104
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,940
so moving one of those from Los Angeles 
to Shanghai will take more than 10 days,

105
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:49,990
but if

106
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,540
you already have ships in soldiers in 
Guam,

107
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,840
you can be to Shanghai in almost three 
days.

108
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,760
This is designed to deter potential 
conflicts.

109
00:05:58,940 --> 00:05:59,773
In fact,
most of those ships would never have to 

110
00:06:01,731 --> 00:06:04,400
fire a single weapon.
Being so powerful.

111
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,234
Bonnets name,
no one would probably dare to attack 

112
00:06:06,291 --> 00:06:07,310
them,
but not only that,

113
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:10,610
many of these ships are not meant to 
combat other armies,

114
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:13,100
but rather than into combat pirates,
for example,

115
00:06:13,101 --> 00:06:13,934
the USS Independence is a warship 
created for the main purpose of 

116
00:06:16,791 --> 00:06:20,090
combating piracy,
and this is just one of many ships,

117
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,390
in fact to the U.
S naval forces getting bigger and bigger

118
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:24,283
all the time,
and this means that so far no one has 

119
00:06:26,391 --> 00:06:31,391
been able to match it.
Maybe to add 46 ships in five years,

120
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:39,370
but 355 ships won't come for a long 
time.

121
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,353
Of course,
this gives America a huge amount of 

122
00:06:41,681 --> 00:06:43,870
power and this can be worrying to some 
people,

123
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:48,250
but so far it's created a safe 
environment where everybody can trade on

124
00:06:48,251 --> 00:06:51,010
troubles whenever it some country or 
some pirates,

125
00:06:51,011 --> 00:06:51,844
once a block of trade routes,
they have to face all those American 

126
00:06:54,491 --> 00:06:55,324
ships.
This is one reason why Southeast Asian 

127
00:06:56,861 --> 00:06:59,200
nations have become exporting 
powerhouses,

128
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:01,510
and of course it's benefited China.

129
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:02,463
Yeah.

130
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,003
The truth is that there are many 
countries that would happily block 

131
00:07:09,331 --> 00:07:11,460
China's trade routes,
but it's China.

132
00:07:11,490 --> 00:07:12,323
Comfortable in this position,
does it like depending so much on 

133
00:07:15,271 --> 00:07:16,530
America's army?
Well,

134
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:21,920
let's have a look.
New Hedge Lamont,

135
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:23,733
so what defines a territory or a 
territory is an area of land onto the 

136
00:07:27,101 --> 00:07:31,600
jurisdiction of a ruler or a states.
Not all territories are born equal.

137
00:07:31,601 --> 00:07:34,960
Some have abundant natural resources 
like Jen's gas and oil,

138
00:07:34,961 --> 00:07:37,630
while others basically having no 
resources,

139
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:40,510
the availability of some resources gives
the country they belong to.

140
00:07:40,511 --> 00:07:41,344
Some pretty big advantages in trade.
Most obvious example of this is oil and 

141
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:48,250
how much she's trade as defined.
Saudi Arabia,

142
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,093
it's a common.

143
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,530
What about the others?
Those who have lists a few resources,

144
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,020
they need to import everything for their
industries.

145
00:07:59,110 --> 00:07:59,943
They must compete with international 
bitters to secure stable suppliers of 

146
00:08:02,951 --> 00:08:03,784
resources,
which basically means their industrial 

147
00:08:05,531 --> 00:08:08,770
cost of production is also going to be 
higher and this,

148
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,500
this steer view is essentially China's 
situation.

149
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,750
Yes,
China's got a lot of industry but almost

150
00:08:13,751 --> 00:08:15,370
no resources,
oil,

151
00:08:15,371 --> 00:08:16,540
steel,
uranium,

152
00:08:16,630 --> 00:08:19,210
most of the things that needs to make 
those mobile phones,

153
00:08:19,211 --> 00:08:22,000
cars or tvs.
It's got to come from other parts of the

154
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:26,380
weld and this appetite for raw materials
is increasing every single day,

155
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:27,910
but this still isn't the end of our 
story.

156
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:28,773
Once those resources are required,
China needs to transport them to its 

157
00:08:31,331 --> 00:08:34,450
territory safely and for as little money
as possible.

158
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:35,343
The South China Sea is the busiest 
collection of shipping lanes in the 

159
00:08:37,961 --> 00:08:41,140
world.
It's the lifeblood of East Asia carrying

160
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,033
most of it straight in oil.
It's obvious then that China would very 

161
00:08:44,591 --> 00:08:49,360
much like to keep these lines of trade 
open and preferably to control them.

162
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,380
It also doesn't have a big consumer 
market like the U,

163
00:08:58,381 --> 00:08:59,214
s.so
at wants to export a lot of what it 

164
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:01,834
makes in order to make money and these 
routes can be blocked at anytime by one 

165
00:09:05,531 --> 00:09:06,364
of their neighboring countries,
which would stop all of that from 

166
00:09:07,691 --> 00:09:09,100
happening.
The Communist Party,

167
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:12,670
the governing force in China also has a 
lot of mouths to feed,

168
00:09:12,671 --> 00:09:16,510
so control over this region is essential
if the party wants to stay in power.

169
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,363
All right,
so I can probably guess what you're 

170
00:09:18,071 --> 00:09:19,660
thinking right now.
You're probably thinking,

171
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:20,950
well,
shiner isn't the only one.

172
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,000
Many of the countries have no natural 
resources either and they don't complain

173
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:28,330
of course,
but there is a big problem here being so

174
00:09:28,331 --> 00:09:29,164
dependent on imports and exports.
China only needs one country to block 

175
00:09:32,471 --> 00:09:35,770
its roots,
to collapse it in a matter of months,

176
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:36,693
and as we mentioned before,
there are many countries who would very 

177
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,110
happily do that,
especially one in particular,

178
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,303
and that's India.

179
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,690
You see the string of islands on the 
Indian Ocean.

180
00:09:44,770 --> 00:09:45,603
Well,
these belong to India and the Indian 

181
00:09:46,791 --> 00:09:47,624
army could block Chinese boats.
This would mean that China couldn't buy 

182
00:09:56,710 --> 00:09:58,810
most of the oil that they currently 
consume.

183
00:09:58,990 --> 00:09:59,823
Most of the oil tankers that go from the
Middle East to China pass through the 

184
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:06,460
Strait of Malacca right where Singapore 
is.

185
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:07,473
We're talking about almost 20 million 
barrels of oil a day and many other 

186
00:10:11,111 --> 00:10:12,040
goods in addition,

187
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,170
but if India blocks the roots among 
those small islands,

188
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,660
good luck trying to get that oil.
In fact,

189
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:21,380
there is such an existential threat to 
China that their former president,

190
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:25,070
Hu Jintao,
used to call this the Malacca dilemma,

191
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:27,250
and we're not just talking about India.
In fact,

192
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,530
America isn't getting through their best
time when it comes to loving the Chinese

193
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:32,750
either and again,
the American navy,

194
00:10:32,751 --> 00:10:36,740
it has the capabilities you block the 
oil supply to China by sea.

195
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,970
This would be far more devastating than 
any trade war so well.

196
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:41,833
What's the solution?

197
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:48,100
Belt and road initiative and its 
maritime counterpart,

198
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:49,990
the string of pearls.

199
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:50,953
The belt and road initiative was 
initiated by President Xi Jinping in 

200
00:10:53,841 --> 00:10:54,674
2013 with the aim of rebuilding 
infrastructure and accelerating Chinese 

201
00:10:58,221 --> 00:10:59,600
economic growth.
Essentially,

202
00:10:59,601 --> 00:11:02,660
this is a brand new silk road and the 
string of pearls,

203
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:04,490
well,
that's its maritime brother.

204
00:11:04,550 --> 00:11:05,383
In 2017 Mr.
she pledged an additional $124 billion 

205
00:11:08,901 --> 00:11:13,730
dollars towards says $900,000,000,000
belt and road initiative.

206
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:14,653
China is promoting this global trade 
infrastructure as a longterm wind wind 

207
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:20,440
campaign for the 65 nations that have 
signed up it.

208
00:11:20,630 --> 00:11:21,463
Most Western leaders,
however they stayed away from the 

209
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,773
Chinese.
Some is announcing the ambitious 

210
00:11:25,221 --> 00:11:26,054
projects about so the 28 heads of state 
presence at what Mr she called a 

211
00:11:29,031 --> 00:11:29,864
gathering of great minds included 
President Putin of Russia and President 

212
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,560
I get on of target.

213
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:42,240
This is indeed a gathering of great 
minds in the coming two days.

214
00:11:42,241 --> 00:11:45,510
I hope that by engaging in a full 
exchange of views,

215
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:48,720
we will contribute to pursuing the belt 
and road initiative,

216
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:53,130
a project of the century so that it will
benefit people across the world.

217
00:11:53,190 --> 00:11:54,070
See jumping

218
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,650
with China,
consolidating its power in relationships

219
00:11:56,651 --> 00:11:59,170
with countries all over the south China 
Sea region.

220
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:03,130
It might become really difficult for the
United States to keep being the big boss

221
00:12:03,131 --> 00:12:06,040
in charge of the region.
If China was to support the US,

222
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:06,903
the United States would lose all of its 
deterrents power in this key region of 

223
00:12:10,001 --> 00:12:13,810
the globe and this would completely 
change the rules of international trade.

224
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:16,870
Americans were pretty worried about this
now the other car,

225
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:21,400
the CIA went so far as to state that the
US has two major problems right now,

226
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:24,540
Russia and China and their efforts to 
undermine the u.

227
00:12:24,541 --> 00:12:28,360
s is influencing key regions like Africa
and the South China Sea,

228
00:12:33,870 --> 00:12:34,703
not naive and we are taking significant 
steps on the counter intelligence side 

229
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:41,090
so that we have all the defenses that we
need us.

230
00:12:41,091 --> 00:12:44,150
Africa commands,
General Thomas Wallet Houser.

231
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,133
Alright,
so I know you're thinking you're 

232
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:46,303
probably thinking America.
It's an empire all over the world and 

233
00:12:48,561 --> 00:12:50,330
we're just talking about one small 
region,

234
00:12:50,331 --> 00:12:53,700
the south China Sea and yeah,
that's absolutely right.

235
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,613
In fact,
China is only threatening us dominance 

236
00:12:56,511 --> 00:12:58,700
in the south China Sea,
not the whole world,

237
00:12:58,910 --> 00:12:59,743
but this region.
It really is the most important when it 

238
00:13:01,641 --> 00:13:06,020
comes to international trade.
And this is why the struggle is quite so

239
00:13:06,021 --> 00:13:08,390
intense that the show,
it still goes on.

240
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,600
In fact,
China knows that if it goes too far with

241
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,434
building military basis,
the u s will call on its allies in the 

242
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,584
region to do the same.
This would mean scaling up military 

243
00:13:23,141 --> 00:13:25,110
spending and look,
China and the US,

244
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,400
they might not be the best couple on the
planet,

245
00:13:27,670 --> 00:13:30,240
but they kind of tolerate each other.
And also the US,

246
00:13:30,241 --> 00:13:31,510
his allies in the region,
well,

247
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,310
they really do have a problem with 
China.

248
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,260
We've got India,
which we mentioned previously.

249
00:13:35,261 --> 00:13:36,094
There's also Japan among others,
and China does not want those guys to 

250
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,740
increase their military presence.
This is why so far,

251
00:13:41,741 --> 00:13:42,574
China is playing a very patient game.
It's a very longterm challenge and 

252
00:13:46,520 --> 00:13:49,810
longterm in Chinese,
that means really longterm.

253
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:54,100
We might be talking about decades out,
but despite the slow path,

254
00:13:54,130 --> 00:13:54,963
you'd better remember the term string of
pearls because it's going to appear a 

255
00:13:58,421 --> 00:14:00,070
lot more in the newspapers.

256
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:06,333
This is going to be so important that at
the beginning of next year on visual 

257
00:14:08,441 --> 00:14:10,540
politic,
we're going to continue telling you more

258
00:14:10,541 --> 00:14:12,970
about this in another series of videos 
that we've got coming up,

259
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:13,833
so you don't want to miss those.

261
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,543
But now the question is,
do you think that the string of pedals 

262
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:24,580
is really such a threat to international
stability?

263
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:29,790
Where does the US go from here?
This is the beginning of the end for the

264
00:14:30,461 --> 00:14:31,540
American empire.
Well,
