1
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:11,490
In 1991,
after several years of negotiations in a

2
00:00:11,491 --> 00:00:13,380
whole lot of tension,
the Baltic states,

3
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:14,760
Lithuania,
Latvia,

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,870
Estonia,
I finally managed to break away from the

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:19,703
Soviet Union.
They finally have the freedom that 

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:21,354
they've wanted for so then 50 years have
passed since the soldiers of the Red 

7
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,530
Army occupying these countries.
During the years under the Soviets.

8
00:00:46,531 --> 00:00:47,364
Repression and fear were the basic 
ingredients in the lives of the people 

9
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:51,600
in Estonia,
Latvia,

10
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:52,523
and Lithuania.
Let's now have a look at some pretty 

11
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:56,360
alarming data.
In Lithuania alone,

12
00:00:56,361 --> 00:00:59,160
a country of little more than two point 
5 million people.

13
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:00,960
These numbers were recorded.

14
00:01:03,590 --> 00:01:07,190
200,000 people were arrested,
questioned and imprisoned.

15
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:10,220
One hundred and 32,000 people were 
deported,

16
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:13,790
especially to Siberia.
Seventy 5,000 prisoners,

17
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:17,420
deportees and partisans were eliminated 
by the Soviet regime

18
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:22,500
and of all of that wasn't enough at the 
time of their independence.

19
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,880
Poverty and shortages were everyday.
Reality is for all of the inhabitants of

20
00:01:26,881 --> 00:01:27,714
these countries.

21
00:01:29,050 --> 00:01:33,520
I remember the days when the counters at
the shops and to Lynn were empty and the

22
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:35,320
people were starving.
Economy,

23
00:01:35,321 --> 00:01:37,450
more or less had to be rebuilt from 
scratch.

24
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,493
Since then,
if you have things have changed a lot 

25
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:42,190
more than I lost.
In fact,

26
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:45,970
from the very moment these countries 
regains their independence,

27
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,150
they decided to bet it's all on 
democracy and freedom.

28
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:55,440
They were calling me today,
some of the freest ones.

29
00:01:55,441 --> 00:01:59,280
They are members of the EU and NATO and 
they prosper today.

30
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:00,143
These are countries with very high 
standards of living and they can really 

31
00:02:02,851 --> 00:02:03,684
be considered rich countries.
The transformation it really has been 

32
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,700
total and remark

33
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:09,863
that

34
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:11,003
they suffered along with the rest of the
world is through the financial crisis 

35
00:02:13,711 --> 00:02:17,640
and it really seemed as if their 
economies were on the verge of collapse.

36
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,520
Economy contracts almost 18 percent in 
the fourth quarter of 2009,

37
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:25,603
but against all odds,
they manage to recover in a very short 

38
00:02:28,461 --> 00:02:29,690
period of time.
Indeed,

39
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,780
they became an example to other 
countries like Spain,

40
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:33,920
Greece,
and Portugal,

41
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:34,783
but that's a whole different thing that 
we're going to talk about being the 

42
00:02:37,341 --> 00:02:38,930
future video.
In this video,

43
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:43,010
we're going to focus on Lithuania and 
talk about a problem that is shared by a

44
00:02:43,011 --> 00:02:43,844
lot of the countries in eastern Europe.
I problem that today is actually one of 

45
00:02:46,971 --> 00:02:48,630
the biggest threats to them.

46
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:53,690
Future brain drain

47
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:58,853
history of Lithuania.
All of the Baltic states in general 

48
00:03:00,971 --> 00:03:02,950
since their freedom in 1991.
Well,

49
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,813
it's a history of success today.
They are modern open countries with 

50
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:09,850
prosperous economies.
As with any good story.

51
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:12,370
Not Everything is quite so pretty.
Yes.

52
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:13,233
That all issues these countries are 
facing and today we're going to 

53
00:03:16,361 --> 00:03:19,210
particularly focus on Lithuania in this 
country.

54
00:03:19,211 --> 00:03:21,460
The biggest problem is brain drain.
Yep.

55
00:03:21,461 --> 00:03:26,080
That's emigration with an e and this is 
no small problem for the country.

56
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:28,250
Okay.

57
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,370
Since 2004,
when the country was integrated into the

58
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:32,303
EU,
mania has lost more than 10 percent of 

59
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:38,180
its population.
That is more than 300,000 people,

60
00:03:38,181 --> 00:03:42,560
especially young people have decided to 
pack up and move to a different country.

61
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,830
Most of those have chosen to move to the
United Kingdom.

62
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:47,920
Yeah.

63
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:50,230
While in western Europe and the United 
States,

64
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:52,930
they aren't concerned about immigration 
in Lithuania.

65
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:56,560
It is the other way around.
They are concerned about people leaving.

66
00:03:56,590 --> 00:03:59,660
They are worried that this might end up 
capitalizing the company.

67
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,620
Nineteen 90.
We have lost about 800,000 people in for

68
00:04:04,621 --> 00:04:06,510
a small country.
This is a huge loss.

69
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,373
We're losing our youngest and brightest 
and in the future we'll just have old 

70
00:04:10,441 --> 00:04:14,070
people who will be dying.
We will have a dying society

71
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:15,623
and there's always the ones who are 
leaving tend to be the most capable and 

72
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,470
best prepared to young people.
There's,

73
00:04:19,471 --> 00:04:22,200
of course has a significant impact on 
the country's economy.

74
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:23,063
The number of young people working 
decreases talent leaves the country and 

75
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:26,904
as the population ages,
but this is not just a problem for 

76
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:31,170
Lithuania.

77
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,833
The early 19 nineties,
some $20 million of central and eastern 

78
00:04:39,331 --> 00:04:40,164
Europe's most talented workers have left
and they have headed largely to western 

79
00:04:43,531 --> 00:04:43,990
Europe.

80
00:04:43,990 --> 00:04:46,330
So who do you think has benefited from 
all of this?

81
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,040
Talent redistribution.
Yup.

82
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:48,883
You got that right.
It's the wealthiest countries and that 

83
00:04:51,131 --> 00:04:55,510
is why we have to be careful about the 
messages being sensed by politicians who

84
00:04:55,511 --> 00:04:59,290
are attempting to criminalize 
immigration in order to get votes.

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,153
Yes,
we're looking at you to reason me and 

86
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:04,180
Donald Trump,
but I mean I know what you're thinking.

87
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,760
If the Baltic countries have been so 
successful,

88
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,623
why are people leaving?
Well because they all looking out for 

89
00:05:10,391 --> 00:05:13,090
their own personal success.
For one,

90
00:05:13,140 --> 00:05:17,200
these countries have managed to develop 
a well prepared young population who can

91
00:05:17,201 --> 00:05:20,740
also speak English to you must haves 
when it comes to looking for a future in

92
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:24,760
another place and then we also have the 
fact that because of all the growth that

93
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:25,594
has happened since 1991,
these people that can now leave the 

94
00:05:27,881 --> 00:05:31,080
country in a comfortable way,
but there is still the key questions you

95
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:31,923
want sell.
Why are they leaving if things aren't 

96
00:05:33,731 --> 00:05:34,930
going so well?
Well,

97
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:37,270
that's not really that hard to explain.

98
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,220
No

99
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:45,530
salaries have improved a lot in the last
several years.

100
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:49,580
The difference between the wealthiest 
countries is still quite big.

101
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:53,570
As an example,
while the average salary in Lithuania is

102
00:05:53,571 --> 00:05:54,404
about 800 euros in United Kingdom,
it is almost 2,500 euros or three times 

103
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:00,104
more.

104
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:00,900
All of this.
Well,

105
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:01,733
I might leave you wondering whether this
impressive economic developments was 

106
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:06,900
actually good for the Baltic countries.
Well,

107
00:06:06,901 --> 00:06:08,520
we would say that overall,
yes,

108
00:06:08,521 --> 00:06:09,354
it's certainly worth it's,
but it does leave us with a couple of 

109
00:06:11,641 --> 00:06:13,320
very important questions.
Well,

110
00:06:13,350 --> 00:06:16,350
the first one is what is the cost of all
of this and seconds,

111
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,130
how can they stop?
The brain

112
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,123
drank

113
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:22,670
putting an end to emigrate.

114
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:23,573
Sure.

115
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:24,923
So stopping this brain drain,
it's become a pretty major priority for 

116
00:06:27,411 --> 00:06:30,560
Eastern European countries.
Some of these countries like Poland,

117
00:06:30,561 --> 00:06:31,670
Latvia,
and Hungary,

118
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:32,533
they have started a return campaign in 
order to persuade immigrants to come 

119
00:06:36,171 --> 00:06:37,004
back home.

120
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,960
Welcome all Polish people who went 
abroad.

121
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:44,890
If only they could come back,
it would be a great day for Poland.

122
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:46,450
Okay.

123
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:47,680
However,
while this,

124
00:06:47,681 --> 00:06:48,514
it's a nice sentiment.
It is definitely in Lithuania where 

125
00:06:50,651 --> 00:06:51,484
there is a larger concern about the 
brain drain that the has been more 

126
00:06:54,131 --> 00:06:56,320
significant support from society.

127
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,660
The last parliamentary elections 
celebrated in October.

128
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,673
The Lithuanian Greens and Farmers Union 
won the elections and took control of 

129
00:07:09,791 --> 00:07:10,624
the government.
Is pinterest party had only one MP in 

130
00:07:13,361 --> 00:07:15,520
the previous elections.
Their main promise,

131
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:17,260
putting an end to immigration,

132
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,880
but well,
of course this is easier said than done,

133
00:07:21,881 --> 00:07:24,880
so the question is how is this party 
going to succeed?

134
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,541
Policy,
leds,

135
00:07:25,541 --> 00:07:27,460
by the way,
by Ramina Cabal Skus,

136
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:30,190
one of the most important businessmen in
the country,

137
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,810
well apparently their top priority is to
stop immigration by attracting much more

138
00:07:34,811 --> 00:07:35,644
foreign investments.
They claim that if they can succeed in 

139
00:07:37,571 --> 00:07:39,370
getting more foreign money for 
investment,

140
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:43,540
they will be able to provide a more jobs
with higher salaries so well,

141
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:47,200
how are they planning to do this well,
by reducing bureaucracy,

142
00:07:47,201 --> 00:07:48,034
chasing corruption,
and also by making adjustments to the 

143
00:07:49,901 --> 00:07:50,734
labor markets.
And the truth is that this does make a 

144
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,373
ton of sense and we could say that the 
Baltic countries really do seem to know 

145
00:07:55,901 --> 00:07:56,734
how to get things done.
Let's hold on for just a second because 

146
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,570
this.
It's not the end of the story.

147
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:03,610
There are some other things that,
well,

148
00:08:03,611 --> 00:08:05,830
they don't look quite so good.

149
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,830
The shadows of the Lithuanian plan

150
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,273
on the one hands.
At the same time as the government 

151
00:08:15,571 --> 00:08:16,404
promised foreign investments,
they have also committed to raise taxes 

152
00:08:19,411 --> 00:08:20,244
by eliminating what is known as a flat 
tax look in Lithuania as well as in 

153
00:08:23,971 --> 00:08:28,110
Estonia and not be at the tax systems.
Really symbol in Lithuania case.

154
00:08:28,111 --> 00:08:31,860
There is this flat tax which is a rate 
of 15 percent for people and companies.

155
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:36,840
That is to say that the Lithuanian who 
makes $10,000 pays $1,500 in taxes,

156
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:40,000
was the one who makes 10 times more at 
100,000 euros,

157
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:43,020
also pays 10 times more,
read 15,000 euros.

158
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:43,883
Raising taxes in this way sort of goes 
against the foreign investments and 

159
00:08:46,681 --> 00:08:50,970
higher salaries plan and this rise will 
direct harm both of those things,

160
00:08:50,990 --> 00:08:52,580
and by the way,
corporate taxes,

161
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,330
they're not as low as they might seem.

162
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:56,040
If we up the social

163
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,873
security contributions and other taxes,
companies pay more than 40 percent of 

164
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:03,600
their gross profits in taxes according 
to the World Bank.

165
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:06,100
Now,
we also have to point this out.

166
00:09:06,101 --> 00:09:06,934
The issue of Russia and NATO,
the previous Lithuanian governments and 

167
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:11,674
the current is no exception.
I've insisted on scaring the population 

168
00:09:14,410 --> 00:09:18,910
and also the rest of the world with the 
Russian threat thing that the country is

169
00:09:18,911 --> 00:09:20,320
constantly in danger.

170
00:09:22,130 --> 00:09:22,671
Okay.
Now,

171
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:24,500
while it is true that the threats are 
real,

172
00:09:24,501 --> 00:09:25,334
it's not really a brilliant way to 
instill confidence in potential 

173
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,140
investors,
and finally,

174
00:09:30,141 --> 00:09:30,974
and maybe most importantly of all,
that is a cultural matter that affects 

175
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:37,100
the entire country.
So you might want to write if this,

176
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:37,934
this brain drain going on,
wouldn't it be logical to try and 

177
00:09:39,921 --> 00:09:43,760
compensate for this by bringing in young
professionals from other countries?

178
00:09:43,790 --> 00:09:44,623
Well,
that's kind of a problem because this 

179
00:09:46,101 --> 00:09:46,934
country,
it's also a bit suspicious about 

180
00:09:48,471 --> 00:09:50,240
immigration.
Most of these countries,

181
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,960
a touch nationalist anyway,
if anything is full session,

182
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:54,794
is that Lithuania is rather this stonier
in Latvia have done their homework and 

183
00:09:57,991 --> 00:10:01,610
is that policies are certainly much more
efficient than the ones that predominate

184
00:10:01,611 --> 00:10:03,040
in the rest of Europe.
Remember,

185
00:10:03,110 --> 00:10:03,943
in 25 years they have managed to become 
rich countries with higher standards of 

186
00:10:07,761 --> 00:10:08,720
living.
Well,

187
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,613
now we'd like to know what you think.
Do you think these countries will 

188
00:10:11,271 --> 00:10:13,340
finally be able to stop this brain 
drain?

189
00:10:13,370 --> 00:10:14,203
Well,
we're looking forward to hearing what 

190
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:17,420
