1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,080
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:12,370
almost 50 years ago in 1969 then 
president Richard Nixon announced the so

3
00:00:12,371 --> 00:00:13,204
called war on drugs.
It's a hard line strategy that aims to 

4
00:00:16,241 --> 00:00:17,074
pursue and punish the production,
distribution and consumption of 

5
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:22,300
substances that were considered 
prohibited drugs.

6
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,960
America's public enemy number one in the
United States is drug abuse.

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:29,493
Since then is if you,
even though Washington has used all his 

8
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:31,864
mind to this hotline strategy as a 
result of is in a resounding failure 

9
00:00:35,050 --> 00:00:37,240
both at home and abroad.
See,

10
00:00:37,241 --> 00:00:38,074
each year the u s government spends tens
of billions of dollars in this 

11
00:00:40,841 --> 00:00:41,674
particular war,
achieving practically nothing more than 

12
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:44,434
imprisoning hundreds of thousands of 
people and fueling a culture of 

13
00:00:47,471 --> 00:00:48,304
violence.
The war on drugs has been going on for 

14
00:00:50,501 --> 00:00:52,750
60 years,
and if a business,

15
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:54,880
if I'd had a business that had failed 
for 60 years,

16
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:56,860
I would have closed it down 59 years 
ago.

17
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,290
The federal government's figures on 
arrests for violence.

18
00:00:59,291 --> 00:01:01,200
NC drug laws are absolutely

19
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:02,133
schilling

20
00:01:06,530 --> 00:01:11,530
for the shoulder.
Every year the United States authorities

21
00:01:14,161 --> 00:01:17,940
rest more than 1 million people for 
breaking anti drug laws.

22
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,460
That is to say in 10 years,
the United States,

23
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,303
the rest as many people as the entire 
population of Greece or Cuba for drug 

24
00:01:24,721 --> 00:01:27,050
related crimes,
which is well,

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:27,480
a lot of

26
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:30,220
people since

27
00:01:30,220 --> 00:01:31,053
1989 ans listen carefully because this 
is rather impressive in the United 

28
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:36,363
States,
more people have been imprisoned for 

29
00:01:37,361 --> 00:01:42,160
this type of crime than for all other 
violent crimes combined.

30
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,630
Our most serious problem today is 
cocaine and in particular crap.

31
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:49,060
Who's responsible?
Let me pet you straight out.

32
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,193
Everyone who uses drugs,
everyone who sells drugs and everyone 

33
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:55,960
who looks the other way.
In fact,

34
00:01:55,961 --> 00:01:56,794
this is precisely what has led the 
country to have the highest 

35
00:01:59,111 --> 00:01:59,944
incarceration rate in the wells four or 
five times higher than other countries 

36
00:02:02,621 --> 00:02:06,820
like France or Germany and even higher 
than totalitarian countries like China.

37
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,850
It's all pretty damn crazy as of course,
as you can imagine,

38
00:02:14,291 --> 00:02:17,850
US jails aren't exactly the best place 
in the world to rehabilitate.

39
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:18,703
In fact,
the American experience seems to say 

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:23,770
quite the opposite,
but all right,

41
00:02:23,771 --> 00:02:24,610
you might be thinking,
okay,

42
00:02:24,611 --> 00:02:26,080
Simon,
it might be a tough strategy,

43
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,600
but maybe it's fulfilling its purpose,
right?

44
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:30,550
Well,
the truth is that no,

45
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:34,390
it isn't beyond crowding prison spending
hundreds of billions and condemning many

46
00:02:34,391 --> 00:02:35,224
young people do have difficulties of 
reentering the world with a criminal 

47
00:02:37,301 --> 00:02:40,480
record.
This war on drugs as achieved very,

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,550
very little.
In fact,

49
00:02:42,551 --> 00:02:45,550
it's achieved practically nothing.
In fact,

50
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:46,413
despite so many efforts,
the United States still has one of the 

51
00:02:49,031 --> 00:02:49,864
highest drug use rates in the world.
This rate is even higher today than it 

52
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:58,870
was in the 1980s we lost more than 175

53
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:00,873
to overdoses every day,
and millions more are struggling with 

54
00:03:03,971 --> 00:03:04,670
addiction

55
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:07,190
and regarding their results outside of 
the United States.

56
00:03:07,191 --> 00:03:08,090
What?
What can I say?

57
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:08,953
We only need to take a look at Latin 
America to see how that's gone because 

58
00:03:11,781 --> 00:03:12,614
my friends,
there was one thing this war on drugs 

59
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,700
has certainly achieved,
and that's helping drug traffickers make

60
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,930
a lot of money.
Yup.

61
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:18,840
You heard that right?

62
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,273
Yeah.

63
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,980
Entire pro edition and strong anti 
strategy.

64
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:33,190
I've made the illegal drug trade 
extremely lucrative.

65
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:34,053
Basically a goldmine,
which is pouring money into drug 

66
00:03:36,551 --> 00:03:38,680
traffickers,
gangs and cartels,

67
00:03:38,740 --> 00:03:41,110
while spreading violence throughout 
Latin America.

68
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,973
Yeah.

69
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,680
Cocaine cartel does not begin in Meti 
and Columbia.

70
00:03:45,740 --> 00:03:47,900
It begins in the streets of New York,
Miami,

71
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,770
Los Angeles and every American city were
crack is bought and sold.

72
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:52,740
Nancy Reagan

73
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:56,920
and drug dealers need to know that we 
want them out of high schools,

74
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:57,993
neighborhoods and our lives and the only
way to do that is to take the customers 

75
00:04:02,351 --> 00:04:07,351
away from the product,
say no to drugs and say yes to life.

76
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,553
That holds your horse is just a moment 
because often many failures it seems a 

77
00:04:11,351 --> 00:04:15,340
new strategy isn't being pursued in the 
United States and so far,

78
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:17,080
well the results have been quite 
promising.

79
00:04:17,110 --> 00:04:20,790
You might have heard about the changes 
in the marijuana industry

80
00:04:20,830 --> 00:04:24,490
with these scissors.
I dubbed the Bri

81
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:35,100
big change

82
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
on January the first 2018 California 
became the eighth territory in the 

83
00:04:42,611 --> 00:04:45,010
United States to legalize the 
production,

84
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,030
distribution and consumption of 
marijuana for recreational use.

85
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,390
It's a medical use was approved way back
in 1996

86
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,340
wow,

87
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:55,173
thanks.
Is this in addition to California and 

88
00:04:56,411 --> 00:04:57,550
Alaska,
Colorado,

89
00:04:57,551 --> 00:04:58,750
Oregon,
Massachusetts,

90
00:04:58,751 --> 00:04:59,620
Maine,
Washington,

91
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,170
Nevada,
ans the capital of Washington DC.

92
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,190
Marijuana is recreational use is 
perfectly legal for its paws.

93
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:07,024
The state of Vermont has just announced 
that starting on July the first 

94
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:12,430
possession and consumption will also be 
legal.

95
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,073
Okay.

96
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,500
As we're talking about a very,
very important change,

97
00:05:17,501 --> 00:05:18,334
especially if you take into account so 
that federal legislation as we'll see 

98
00:05:20,981 --> 00:05:21,814
later,
still considers this a prohibited 

99
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:24,730
activity.
Well,

100
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:29,230
last year this new marijuana industry 
legally moved almost a $7 billion,

101
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:31,870
a figure that is expected to rise 
strongly in the upcoming years,

102
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:32,733
especially since the California market 
alone is estimated to make more than $5 

103
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:37,443
billion.
We're talking about an industry that is 

104
00:05:43,271 --> 00:05:44,104
already generating many jobs and also 
paying loads of tax and we're not only 

105
00:05:47,741 --> 00:05:49,990
talking about selling marijuana for 
direct consumption.

106
00:05:49,991 --> 00:05:51,820
A lot of new businesses are also 
emerging,

107
00:05:51,821 --> 00:05:54,100
which take advantage of its ingredients,

108
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,870
candy,
cookies,

109
00:05:55,930 --> 00:05:58,010
sweets.
We have hundreds of products.

110
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:02,240
This business is worth a lot and the 
state keeps 25% of every dollar we make.

111
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,980
Eric Kinney,
owner of Zen,

112
00:06:03,981 --> 00:06:07,190
West Hollywood,
a marijuana dispensary in Los Angeles.

113
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,163
Understand to believe the states that 
have legalized this industry have also 

114
00:06:10,251 --> 00:06:13,280
set special regulations and taxes for 
it.

115
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:15,963
Okay.

116
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:18,380
Cities and counties have basically done 
the same thing,

117
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,940
regulation state,
how it can be sold,

118
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:22,550
where it can be sold,
and how much has to be paid for it.

119
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:25,340
It's like any other heavily regulated 
industry.

120
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,710
Look at the pharmaceutical industry or 
the liquor industry.

121
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,663
They're heavily,
heavily regulated industries and the 

122
00:06:30,291 --> 00:06:32,990
cannabis industry is no different.
Cara Martinson,

123
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:34,003
Federal Affairs Manager for the 
California State Association of 

124
00:06:36,231 --> 00:06:37,064
counties,
and this is not exactly cheap for these 

125
00:06:38,781 --> 00:06:40,570
companies.
In some California in cities,

126
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:44,780
the sum of all taxes can amounts to 40% 
of these new companies turnover,

127
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:45,943
which is a lot in Colorado.
The first dates there's a legalized the 

128
00:06:48,471 --> 00:06:51,080
sale and consumption of marijuana for 
recreational use,

129
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:51,914
the industry already invoices about $1 
billion every year and to the state's 

130
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:56,114
income in taxes exceed $200 million.
Among the eight states where 

131
00:07:00,591 --> 00:07:04,520
recreational marijuana is legal only 
Washington as a higher tax rate at about

132
00:07:04,521 --> 00:07:09,521
50% Colorado and Nevada both follow with
rates of 36% Oregon has a tax of 20% and

133
00:07:10,071 --> 00:07:12,950
Alaska has a rate of up to 20% Aaron 
Smith,

134
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,843
a CNN reporter,
however you had to wait a minutes 

135
00:07:15,501 --> 00:07:19,910
because everything doesn't end here.
Let's just say that there's a problem.

136
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,770
I'm very serious problem,
in fact,

137
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:27,790
as I said before,
federal us,

138
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:31,210
nor continues to consider this a 
forbidden activity which makes this type

139
00:07:31,211 --> 00:07:34,330
of business very difficult,
if not impossible when it comes to,

140
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,193
for example,
obtaining credits from the financial 

141
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,630
institution.
Of course,

142
00:07:37,631 --> 00:07:40,360
if a bank decides to finance these 
companies activities,

143
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:44,200
they could even be accused of 
collaborating with a drug trafficker and

144
00:07:44,230 --> 00:07:45,063
not only that,
see until now a policy in stools by the 

145
00:07:49,630 --> 00:07:50,463
Obama Administration was in force,
which led to the Justice Department 

146
00:07:51,821 --> 00:07:52,654
asking federal prosecutors not to file 
charges if the drug's production sale 

147
00:07:56,081 --> 00:07:59,050
and consumption with legal based on 
state laws.

148
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:01,233
Well,
this policy known as the Cole memo was 

149
00:08:02,651 --> 00:08:03,484
suspended by Jeff sessions.
Donald trump's appointed attorney 

150
00:08:05,861 --> 00:08:06,694
general.

151
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:09,530
This drug is dangerous.
You cannot play with it.

152
00:08:09,531 --> 00:08:10,364
It's not funny.
It's not something to laugh about and 

153
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,333
and trying to send that message with 
clarity that good people don't smoke 

154
00:08:18,201 --> 00:08:18,970
marijuana.

155
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:22,150
The prosecutor has announced that he 
wants to prosecute marijuana businesses,

156
00:08:22,151 --> 00:08:24,940
which by the way,
trump promised he wouldn't do during his

157
00:08:24,941 --> 00:08:27,460
campaign.
But I think in terms of marijuana,

158
00:08:27,461 --> 00:08:28,780
I think,
and legalization,

159
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,760
I think that should be a state issue 
state.

160
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:32,013
This is why this entirely new industry 
is now submerged in a sea of 

161
00:08:34,421 --> 00:08:36,340
uncertainty.
Will be attorney general,

162
00:08:36,370 --> 00:08:39,940
fulfill his wishes.
Will the trump administration attack the

163
00:08:39,941 --> 00:08:42,400
marijuana industry?
These are the questions on the table,

164
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,263
but well,
only the future can answer for now 

165
00:08:44,651 --> 00:08:45,484
though.
We can discuss why this change in 

166
00:08:46,661 --> 00:08:47,494
approach could be a huge,
I'm of changes a few years since 

167
00:09:00,211 --> 00:09:01,044
Colorado became the first states in 2014
to legalize the recreational use of 

168
00:09:04,831 --> 00:09:07,050
marijuana.
Just as we've seen in this video,

169
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,940
a few more states have joined since 
then,

170
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,803
so we can now analyze what's happens and
we can look at this policy's 

171
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,960
consequences.
The time legalization critic stated that

172
00:09:19,391 --> 00:09:23,200
the risks of allowing the recreational 
use of cannabis were really high.

173
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:25,570
For example,
they said consumption among miners would

174
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,660
probably increase as would crime and 
traffic accidents.

175
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:30,650
Well,
now we can see what actually happens and

176
00:09:30,651 --> 00:09:34,270
it's not just the truth is nothing like 
these catastrophic predictions.

177
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,163
Neither violence nor consumption among 
miners and our traffic accidents have 

178
00:09:37,691 --> 00:09:38,650
increased.
In fact,

179
00:09:38,710 --> 00:09:41,410
legalization has had very positive 
consequences

180
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:46,323
on the one hand and the quality of the 
product sold on the black market has 

181
00:09:48,131 --> 00:09:48,964
increased in consumption of more 
dangerous substances has actually 

182
00:09:51,461 --> 00:09:52,294
decreased in the states.
Legalization of marijuana for 

183
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:59,140
recreational use has given us consumers 
access to high quality marijuana.

184
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,280
We genetically improve strains,
groaning,

185
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:02,163
greenhouses or rule beneath does manawat
a drug war expert at Mexico's National 

186
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,330
Autonomous University and keep listening
here because this is really important.

187
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:11,253
A few years ago,
the Cato Institute published a study 

188
00:10:13,151 --> 00:10:16,420
that determines that eight out of 10 
deaths caused by drugs.

189
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:18,580
What do you to the product?
Poor quality.

190
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:23,610
This is a major social problem,
so consumption except for medicine we'll

191
00:10:24,881 --> 00:10:26,940
use is never good.
That certainly clear,

192
00:10:26,950 --> 00:10:27,783
but there's still the demands,
which is why improving the product 

193
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:33,550
quality and safety reduces or potential 
damage,

194
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:34,450
but there's more hair

195
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:41,980
legalization is reducing as logical the 
cartels business and therefore the money

196
00:10:41,981 --> 00:10:44,140
that these groups receive.
In addition,

197
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,490
and this is perhaps its most important 
effects,

198
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:49,690
it has allowed a marijuana trafficking 
related arrests do drop,

199
00:10:49,691 --> 00:10:54,691
which has had two very clear 
consequences for one security forces and

200
00:10:55,001 --> 00:10:55,834
courts have been able to allocate more 
resources to fighting serious crime and 

201
00:10:58,841 --> 00:10:59,674
for another it has reduced the number of
people in prison for victimless crimes 

202
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,243
like marijuana consumption.
We could say that in the states that 

203
00:11:05,561 --> 00:11:07,870
opted for legalization,
the culture of violence,

204
00:11:07,871 --> 00:11:11,080
which is a serious problem in the United
States has decreased.

205
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:13,953
And if that one's enough,
legalization means that the governments 

206
00:11:15,521 --> 00:11:18,010
can now collect taxes from this 
industry.

207
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:21,460
So if the United States wants to 
decrease its high consumption rates,

208
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,760
it looks like a legalizing marijuana,
maybe a really good idea.

209
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:32,150
Legalization sheds light on a business 
that has been in the shadows until now,

210
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:35,180
while allowing for a safer and better 
controlled products.

211
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,043
On top of that,
the authorities get allocate the money 

212
00:11:37,221 --> 00:11:38,054
obtained through this industry's taxes 
to carry out awareness and health 

213
00:11:40,551 --> 00:11:41,384
campaigns.
It's something that my the way was very 

214
00:11:42,651 --> 00:11:45,200
successful in Portugal,
but that's something we're going to talk

215
00:11:45,201 --> 00:11:46,160
about in another video.

216
00:11:48,740 --> 00:11:49,573
The fact is maybe due to all of this 
polls showed that more than 60% of 

217
00:11:52,131 --> 00:11:52,964
Americans favor legalization.
More states are continuing to announce 

218
00:12:01,161 --> 00:12:01,994
their intention to legalize marijuana,
not only for medical use but also for 

219
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,093
recreational.
This is certainly something that's 

220
00:12:07,421 --> 00:12:08,254
becoming a trend.

221
00:12:10,490 --> 00:12:11,323
In 2013 year ago,
I became the first country in the world 

222
00:12:13,461 --> 00:12:14,294
to legalize the production,
distribution and consumption of 

223
00:12:16,341 --> 00:12:17,174
marijuana.
Although it is highly regulated that in 

224
00:12:18,921 --> 00:12:19,754
the year 2018 everything indicates the 
Canada is going to follow in his 

225
00:12:22,341 --> 00:12:23,174
footsteps.
At least that's what Prime Minister 

226
00:12:24,381 --> 00:12:25,214
Justin Trudeau has promised.
The reason we are choosing to legalize 

227
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,220
control marijuana is because the current
system is not protecting our kids.

228
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:37,640
It's right now easier for a an underage 
Canadian,

229
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:40,370
the teenager to buy a joint,
uh,

230
00:12:40,371 --> 00:12:42,560
than it is for them to get their hands 
on a bottle of beer.

231
00:12:42,620 --> 00:12:43,453
By the way,
just as an extra hit about 80 cannabis 

232
00:12:45,441 --> 00:12:49,670
related companies are listed on the 
Canadian Stock Exchange and in 2017 they

233
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:53,270
revalued by no less than 250% not bad.
Right.

234
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,220
It seems like a new industry is 
developing a new industry in which among

235
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,050
others the well known investor,
Peter Thiel,

236
00:13:00,051 --> 00:13:00,884
who we already talked about here on 
visual politic is betting strongly 

237
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:05,630
namely through the Canadian company 
privateer holdings,

238
00:13:05,690 --> 00:13:08,660
which is setting up the largest 
marijuana plantation in Europe,

239
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,523
in Portugal.

240
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:11,803
Anyways,
you have your,

241
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:13,760
that's the way things are,
but now it's your turn.

242
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:16,220
Do you support the legalization of 
marijuana?

243
00:13:16,221 --> 00:13:19,100
Will leave us your answer in the
