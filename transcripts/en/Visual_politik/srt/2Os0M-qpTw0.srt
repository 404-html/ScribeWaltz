1
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:08,913
Showing you that is already a giant.
This country is the largest trading 

2
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:12,560
power in the world,

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,340
the wells with hundreds of products and 
have one of the largest foreign currency

4
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:23,580
reserves in the entire planet.
I don't see even the petro monarchies in

5
00:00:23,581 --> 00:00:27,000
the Persian Gulf can compete with this 
giant country.

6
00:00:27,030 --> 00:00:29,070
Ends with all of this.
It isn't surprising defined.

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:31,920
Some analysts see states that China will
surpass.

8
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:32,754
The United States is the leading 
economic power and they're going to do 

9
00:00:35,881 --> 00:00:37,470
that.
We have a lot more inhabitants.

10
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,350
However,
we usually forget a very important thing

11
00:00:40,351 --> 00:00:41,940
and this is the GDP.
Well,

12
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:44,040
it's not everything.
Economic power.

13
00:00:44,041 --> 00:00:44,874
The real power is closely related to 
corporate power and when it comes to 

14
00:00:48,181 --> 00:00:49,014
that,
China is still a long way from reaching 

15
00:00:51,061 --> 00:00:51,894
the levels of the United States.
If we look at the top 100 largest 

16
00:00:53,911 --> 00:00:58,050
companies in the world,
56 of them are Americans and only 11 are

17
00:00:58,051 --> 00:00:58,884
Chinese,
and this is something to really bear in 

18
00:01:00,331 --> 00:01:01,164
mind because multinationals in 
controlled of foreign investments ends 

19
00:01:04,051 --> 00:01:07,170
of 80 percent of the world's exports.
Now the big question is,

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,290
what's going to happen to these Chinese 
companies in the future?

21
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:13,590
How are things changing and what can we 
really expect?

22
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,453
These are some of the questions that 
we're going to be answering in today's 

23
00:01:16,921 --> 00:01:17,754
video.

24
00:01:20,530 --> 00:01:24,860
Chinese giant development,
the Chinese economy,

25
00:01:24,861 --> 00:01:25,694
as had unimpressive growth rates in the 
last three decades and key to this was 

26
00:01:29,091 --> 00:01:31,850
the concept of them being the welds 
factory.

27
00:01:31,910 --> 00:01:32,743
This is what China is known for.
They are known as a country that has 

28
00:01:35,481 --> 00:01:36,314
become a world power and has lifted 
hundreds of thousands of people from 

29
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:42,770
poverty with a relatively simple 
premise,

30
00:01:42,771 --> 00:01:46,130
producing everything and producing it at
a low cost.

31
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,091
Toys,
electronics,

32
00:01:49,091 --> 00:01:50,110
tools,
clothing.

33
00:01:50,140 --> 00:01:50,973
When you enter a store,
you aren't going to find hundreds of 

34
00:01:52,721 --> 00:01:55,050
products with something in common and 
that's that.

35
00:01:55,060 --> 00:02:00,010
They are all manufactured in massive 
industrial areas located all over China.

36
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:05,950
The in order for a country to really be 
the leading economic power,

37
00:02:05,951 --> 00:02:10,630
these companies need to start producing 
much more complex products.

38
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:11,493
Mans they will have to stop competing on
cost and start looking at far higher 

39
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,633
added value.
This can include the production of 

40
00:02:17,141 --> 00:02:19,390
things like capital assets,
planes,

41
00:02:19,391 --> 00:02:22,210
medical devices,
and computer processes.

42
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:23,163
That driverless car,
I have seen it all entails driving the 

43
00:02:26,651 --> 00:02:28,990
future traffic,
light street lamps,

44
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:30,093
business runs on the cloud,
and the cloud runs on Intel and today 

45
00:02:37,931 --> 00:02:38,764
all these sectors are dominated by the 
large multinational companies of the 

46
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:43,570
United States,
South Korea,

47
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:45,130
Europe,
and Japan.

48
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,440
It is true that many leading products 
are manufactured in China,

49
00:02:53,441 --> 00:02:54,760
for example,
the iphone,

50
00:02:54,761 --> 00:02:55,594
but this is not exactly true because 
what China actually is more like the 

51
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:03,010
assembly.
What this means is that the more complex

52
00:03:03,011 --> 00:03:03,844
parts they're bought from other 
countries and then they simply put 

53
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,260
together in China to better illustrate 
this,

54
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,280
consider this.

55
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,180
Each year trying to import more than 
$200,000,000,000

56
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,140
in semiconductors,
which are essential in the manufacturing

57
00:03:15,170 --> 00:03:16,400
of mobile devices.

58
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:17,343
Just for comparison.
That is more money than what the entire 

59
00:03:19,301 --> 00:03:21,920
country spends on petrol.
However,

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:24,790
Chinese companies have made many 
advances

61
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,213
today.
A fourth of all exports are capital 

62
00:03:29,111 --> 00:03:33,100
goods such as machines for example,
or high tech products.

63
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:38,580
In some sectors like telecommunications,
wind turbines or high speed trains.

64
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:41,010
Chinese companies,
all the world leaders,

65
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:46,203
just that because Chinese companies are 
also learning how to make it in the 

66
00:03:48,791 --> 00:03:49,750
international market.

67
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:50,603
Yes,

68
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,620
great.
Chinese conquest.

69
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:57,553
Two Thousand and 16 was the 40th 
anniversary of the ends of the cultural 

70
00:04:00,681 --> 00:04:01,514
revolution.
This was a telephone campaign which now 

71
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,424
organized in order to purify the 
revolution and finish off all remnants 

72
00:04:08,151 --> 00:04:11,330
of capitalism in Chinese society.
Since then,

73
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,193
things have changed a lot so much that 
China is only behind the United States 

74
00:04:16,701 --> 00:04:19,640
in terms of numbers of multinational 
companies,

75
00:04:19,641 --> 00:04:20,474
companies in this country that's 
starting to make it into global markets 

76
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:25,010
as well.
They're doing it really,

77
00:04:25,011 --> 00:04:25,844
really well.

78
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,630
20 16 Chinese companies spent an 
incredible amount of money,

79
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:31,523
$225,
billion dollars in the purchase of 

80
00:04:33,511 --> 00:04:36,450
foreign companies in Europe and the 
United States alone.

81
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,570
They acquired more than 450 company.

82
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:45,620
Chinese companies are buying all kinds 
of businesses,

83
00:04:45,621 --> 00:04:47,000
mining companies,
banks,

84
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:49,010
oil companies,
pharmaceutical companies,

85
00:04:49,011 --> 00:04:52,340
agricultural companies,
even luxury hotel chains,

86
00:04:52,341 --> 00:04:54,500
jewelry companies,
and football clubs.

87
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:55,041
Yep.
Yeah.

88
00:04:55,041 --> 00:04:55,874
That right to view of the Chinese have 
even bought into Milan and that is just 

89
00:04:59,571 --> 00:05:00,500
one example.

90
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:05,280
Just your city gets a $400,
million dollar Chinese investment deal,

91
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,520
but if there is one thing in particular 
that the Chinese love to invest in,

92
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,980
well that would be developing country

93
00:05:14,290 --> 00:05:15,123
Australia and the United States are the 
two countries that receive the most in 

94
00:05:18,491 --> 00:05:21,880
Chinese investment dollars.
More than half of all Chinese investment

95
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:25,030
is made in emerging countries located in
Asia,

96
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:26,740
Africa,
Latin America,

97
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:27,663
and the Middle East.

98
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,270
Almost save at the more risky the 
country,

99
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:34,800
the more willing the Chinese art to 
invest in it.

100
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,980
Know this might surprise you,
but this,

101
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:37,823
this is not the end of the story.
Chinese companies are also starting to 

102
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:42,420
compete hard.
Well,

103
00:05:42,490 --> 00:05:43,323
if there was only one Chinese company 
and the top 100 most valuable companies 

104
00:05:46,031 --> 00:05:48,940
in 2006,
that was 14 by the year,

105
00:05:48,941 --> 00:05:49,774
2015.
And take a look at the smart phone 

106
00:05:51,581 --> 00:05:52,410
industry.

107
00:05:52,410 --> 00:05:56,570
Yeah,
up

108
00:05:56,570 --> 00:05:58,310
until having a Chinese

109
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,000
phone.
Well,

110
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,710
it was a bit weird,
right?

111
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:03,710
Well today the four main Chinese 
manufacturer is Apo.

112
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,770
Huawei,
Vivo in Chalmette ons,

113
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:06,613
just more famous than they were a few 
years ago because they also take more 

114
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,453
than 10 percent of the welds profits in 
this industry and this is a figure that 

115
00:06:13,851 --> 00:06:18,140
is growing more and more every single 
year and if you want another example,

116
00:06:18,141 --> 00:06:21,590
whether you just have to look to Lenovo,
which is a Chinese multinational company

117
00:06:21,591 --> 00:06:22,424
that was born just a few years ago and 
indeed it bought the laptop division of 

118
00:06:25,431 --> 00:06:30,431
IBM and is now the largest computer 
company in the world as they even supply

119
00:06:30,621 --> 00:06:34,940
equipment to the Pentagon and how about 
even more examples this hire the biggest

120
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:35,774
manufacturer of household appliances or 
go a company that's acquiring land all 

121
00:06:38,811 --> 00:06:41,480
over the world like sugarcane 
plantations in Australia,

122
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:45,740
French vineyards or soy plantations in 
Brazil and then this Guidea Cola company

123
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:50,210
which you might not have heard of,
but it actually bought out Volvo in 2010

124
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,433
Volvo.
That legendary Swedish car company is 

125
00:06:53,331 --> 00:06:55,660
now property of a Chinese company.

126
00:07:00,870 --> 00:07:03,660
That is a sector where China is really 
getting ahead.

127
00:07:03,750 --> 00:07:06,420
It is against all the odds,
the Internet,

128
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,060
and I say against all odds here because 
as you probably know,

129
00:07:09,061 --> 00:07:09,894
China is subject to complete control of 
its Internet by the Chinese government 

130
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,710
with something known as the great 
firewall.

131
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:17,633
This blocks access to you facebook,
Google ends the economist to name just 

132
00:07:20,821 --> 00:07:21,481
three.
However,

133
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,620
on the other hand,
in China,

134
00:07:22,621 --> 00:07:25,350
it's pretty normal to do everything via 
apps.

135
00:07:25,351 --> 00:07:27,000
For example,
when you visit China,

136
00:07:27,001 --> 00:07:27,834
you rarely pay with credit cards.
The most common thing is to pay with a 

137
00:07:30,151 --> 00:07:34,410
mobile phone using the APP we chat.
This is something of a super app that is

138
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,620
like an all in one facebook page,
twitter,

139
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,473
etc.

140
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,050
By the way,
we chat is also owned by ten cent,

141
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,810
one of the top 15 most valuable 
companies in the world,

142
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,673
which is also the world's largest 
supplier of online games and one of the 

143
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:51,390
largest shareholders of tests

144
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,430
by now.
You proBably realizing that,

145
00:07:56,431 --> 00:07:58,350
oh yes,
the chinese,

146
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,890
they are everywhere.
as for another example of their success,

147
00:08:01,891 --> 00:08:06,891
do consider ali baba or an ecommerce 
company that brings in $450,000,000,000

148
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:11,070
every year and in China relaying this 
company,

149
00:08:11,071 --> 00:08:16,071
it has $400,
million clients and dwelled,

150
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,213
as napoleon said,
let's try and asleep for when she wakes 

151
00:08:19,731 --> 00:08:21,550
up,
she will shake the wells,

152
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:24,310
but before we all getting at sketch,
just have a think about what it means.

153
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:26,590
It means more competition.
It means better prices,

154
00:08:26,591 --> 00:08:29,860
better products,
and faster technological developments.

155
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,753
As consumers,
we can benefit a great deal from this 

156
00:08:32,981 --> 00:08:33,814
transition.
Now obviously it does have plenty of 

157
00:08:35,171 --> 00:08:37,990
risks to,
or at least this is what us intelligence

158
00:08:37,991 --> 00:08:39,500
agencies all warning,

159
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:41,483
according to the house,
permanent select committee on 

160
00:08:43,321 --> 00:08:44,154
intelligence is report.
Chinese companies cannot be trusted to 

161
00:08:47,371 --> 00:08:48,204
be free of foreign state influence and 
thus posted security threat to the 

162
00:08:51,961 --> 00:08:53,610
United States and to our system,

163
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:54,703
and then there's the risk are companies 
which are going to have more and more 

164
00:08:56,191 --> 00:08:58,500
competition all day.
They're also going to have more and more

165
00:08:58,501 --> 00:09:01,590
opportunities to which we previously 
discussed in the video.

166
00:09:01,591 --> 00:09:02,424
That will link to you on the screen now,
but let's not get too ahead of 

167
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:06,024
ourselves.
Chinese companies all still far behind 

168
00:09:08,071 --> 00:09:13,071
in technological terms as they are in 
debt and well a great deal of it.

169
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,910
Chinese corporate debt levels are too 
high,

170
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:21,510
but it will take time to bring them down
to more manageable level.

171
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:24,580
This,
this is not the end of this.

172
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,443
Don't forget that China is a 
dictatorship and this means that the 

173
00:09:27,971 --> 00:09:31,240
government tends to much power when it 
comes to corporate decisions.

174
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,790
Further,
the government's is pretty arbitrary and

175
00:09:33,791 --> 00:09:35,290
it's really unpredictable.
For example,

176
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:36,124
a few years ago,
the government encouraged chinese 

177
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:41,560
companies do try the international 
markets and they would loan them as much

178
00:09:41,561 --> 00:09:42,394
money as they needed to do so.
Now they've decided they want to do the 

179
00:09:44,951 --> 00:09:45,784
opposite.
If a chinese company that wants to buy 

180
00:09:47,111 --> 00:09:47,944
out a foreign company,
the need the approval of the chinese 

181
00:09:50,651 --> 00:09:54,760
communist party and there are new tough 
limitations on money leaving the country

182
00:09:54,790 --> 00:09:56,710
further to that,
we have to mention the censorship,

183
00:09:56,711 --> 00:09:57,544
the legal uncertainty,
trade obstacles and the bad reputation 

184
00:09:59,741 --> 00:10:02,800
of chinese products and so on and so 
forth.

185
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,620
So we can say that right now,
the United States,

186
00:10:05,621 --> 00:10:06,454
his position as leader is not in 
particular danger unless something 

187
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:12,790
changes that is more dramatic than we 
are currently seeing.

188
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,530
Long term though.
Well,

189
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,080
who knows?
