1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,250
Devi was Argentina is not exactly having
its best moments.

2
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:11,263
Okay.

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,003
Mauricio Macri has,
government has had to ask for a bailout 

4
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,620
from the International Monetary Fund.
And the truth is this,

5
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:22,640
in the last few decades,
crises,

6
00:00:22,641 --> 00:00:23,474
devaluations,
inflation and payment suspensions has 

7
00:00:25,791 --> 00:00:29,090
become commonplace in Argentina as 
politics and the economy.

8
00:00:29,120 --> 00:00:30,860
Well,
throughout this entire process,

9
00:00:30,861 --> 00:00:33,640
one political movement has had an 
absolute influence.

10
00:00:33,670 --> 00:00:34,503
Perrona isn't it?

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,440
All right.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,513
What exactly is this political stream 
known as Peronas and how did it come 

13
00:00:54,881 --> 00:00:57,850
about and what impact has it really has 
on Argentina?

14
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:58,743
Well,
we're going to talk about it all on 

15
00:00:59,471 --> 00:01:00,304
visual politic in two videos and in the 
first one we're going to focus on its 

16
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,040
origins and its identity.
So listen up.

17
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,283
Yeah.

18
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:17,510
First of all,
who was Kwan Domingo,

19
00:01:17,540 --> 00:01:19,100
Peron,
and most importantly,

20
00:01:19,101 --> 00:01:19,934
how did he manage to gain power and 
influence in Argentine politics for 

21
00:01:23,031 --> 00:01:24,560
seven decades?
Well,

22
00:01:24,561 --> 00:01:25,394
it's the beginning of this story.
We have to go all the way back to the 

23
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:31,160
1930s that time Argentine nationalism 
was in its golden age,

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,370
Argentina.
It was undoubtedly Latin America's great

25
00:01:41,371 --> 00:01:43,530
power,
just like the 1929 crisis.

26
00:01:43,531 --> 00:01:44,364
It was still one of the 10 richest 
countries in the world and wages were 

27
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:49,920
much,
much higher than in Europe.

28
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,860
How has the way to second tier,
because in spite of this,

29
00:01:58,861 --> 00:02:02,850
the 1929 crisis had taken its toll 
hitting the country hard.

30
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:03,743
The tension led to the first military 
coup in 1930 [inaudible] support is by 

31
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:09,570
many political,
economic and social sectors,

32
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,970
especially on the conservative side of 
things.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,980
This militaristic authoritarians 
nationalists,

34
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:23,010
Panorama,
it's became customer ether.

35
00:02:23,070 --> 00:02:25,230
Many officers of the origin time,
Amit did,

36
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:28,440
he sent to Germany and Italy to take 
advanced courses.

37
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:34,743
Debbie,
what do you know who one of these 

38
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:36,940
officers was?
Well,

39
00:02:36,970 --> 00:02:39,850
yeah,
that would be Juan Domingo Peron who was

40
00:02:39,851 --> 00:02:40,684
sent to you.
It's a a country where he met and 

41
00:02:42,131 --> 00:02:42,964
studied firsthand how Benito 
Miscellaneous governments was organized 

42
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:46,803
and you know what?
Soon after he'd get the chance to put 

43
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,470
this knowledge right into practice,

44
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:54,433
you see as the beginning of the 1940s 
Argentina was under the control of a 

45
00:02:57,801 --> 00:02:58,634
corrupt and authoritarians governments 
and governments that had perpetuated 

46
00:03:01,510 --> 00:03:02,343
electoral fraud and attempted to stay in
power at all costs under these 

47
00:03:09,811 --> 00:03:10,644
circumstances.
On June the fourth of 1943 a group of 

48
00:03:13,021 --> 00:03:17,970
young officers in the Argentine army 
held a coup to tar supposedly to restore

49
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,893
a transparent electoral system.
One of these offices was our 

50
00:03:21,781 --> 00:03:25,610
protagonist,
leftenant Colonel Hon Domingo Peron.

51
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,770
Yeah.
By the way,

52
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,633
this was Argentina's second cue to tar 
off to the 1930s one but don't think it 

53
00:03:34,811 --> 00:03:35,740
was.
It's lost.

54
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:38,110
Certainly not the case.
During the next 30 years.

55
00:03:38,111 --> 00:03:38,944
The country has suffered for more keys.
The case is dear viewers that it was 

56
00:03:45,751 --> 00:03:46,584
this 1943 q which opens the doors to 
politics and power for lefthand and 

57
00:03:50,171 --> 00:03:51,004
Colonel [inaudible] Domingo Peron.
We can practically see that this is 

58
00:03:53,551 --> 00:03:56,940
where Argentina's modern history began.
So listen up

59
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:12,893
two and a half years that the military 
government lasted Paranas Korea was 

60
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,433
meteoric.
This was despite the fact that until 

61
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:21,800
then had held a very low rank positions 
such as head of the Department of Labor,

62
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,950
a position that in principle was mad.
Do I say it's rather bureaucratic?

63
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:26,813
However,
hold on a second because thanks to his 

64
00:04:27,751 --> 00:04:28,584
political intelligence product managed.
You can use this position as a 

65
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:34,260
springboard for his rise to power.
You see it from the very beginning,

66
00:04:34,261 --> 00:04:35,094
quantum and go [inaudible] and used 
everything had learned on the Benito 

67
00:04:37,351 --> 00:04:42,351
Mussolini in Italy starting by winning 
some of the unions support that way each

68
00:04:45,031 --> 00:04:45,864
time the labor department's had to 
intervene in a conflict between 

69
00:04:48,271 --> 00:04:50,190
employers and unions related to 
[inaudible],

70
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:54,030
the former.
The employers would almost always lose.

71
00:04:54,090 --> 00:04:54,923
As you can imagine,
this meant that this man's popularity 

72
00:04:57,001 --> 00:04:58,410
didn't stop grabbing.

73
00:05:02,030 --> 00:05:02,400
In fact,

74
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:03,233
shortly after I put on was appointed 
minister of war and then vice 

75
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:09,090
presidents,
or without forgetting the labor policies

76
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,070
and the unions,
because if something was very,

77
00:05:11,071 --> 00:05:11,904
very clear to this leftenant colonel,
it was that that would be as political 

78
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,834
springboard.

79
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,213
He wasn't the only one aspiring to power
and so much prominence led to a lot of 

80
00:05:27,151 --> 00:05:27,984
jealousy.
So much so that the military leaders 

81
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,533
asked him to move away from the 
governments in 1945 so we could perhaps 

82
00:05:33,961 --> 00:05:37,650
expect this to be the ends of this 
military man's political career.

83
00:05:37,710 --> 00:05:38,760
Rice.
Well,

84
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:39,743
no,
nothing could be further from the truth 

85
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,380
on had learned how much influence the 
media could have in Europe.

86
00:05:46,381 --> 00:05:47,214
So he asked his superiors if he could 
say goodbye through the national radio 

87
00:05:50,161 --> 00:05:54,240
network.
They naively accepted in Parana,

88
00:05:54,241 --> 00:05:57,060
took full advantage of this opportunity 
in his farewell.

89
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,440
She thinks the working passes for that 
support and the questions,

90
00:06:00,441 --> 00:06:03,130
the continuity of the social benefits 
that had removed.

91
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:14,470
Paul,
Hey Paul,

92
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:25,933
bobby,

93
00:06:30,970 --> 00:06:31,803
hello.

94
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:39,950
It has a huge effect.
In the following days,

95
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:40,784
the unions mobilized in his favor.
Ends on October the 17th thousands of 

96
00:06:43,881 --> 00:06:48,290
workers occupied the plaza de Mayo,
the nerve center of Argentine politics,

97
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,090
the government disorientated.
By the way,

98
00:07:01,091 --> 00:07:02,590
events unfolded,
asked for you.

99
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:06,310
Leftenant colonel himself to appease the
masses and this is something he did,

100
00:07:06,311 --> 00:07:09,460
but only after agreeing that he'd be a 
candidate in the next elections.

101
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,000
He also made sure that he had the 
support of the public powers.

102
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:23,933
Why does it make you,
it person has managed to become a 

103
00:07:25,651 --> 00:07:28,260
candidate,
but now he needed to win the election.

104
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:33,510
We've seen at the time Argentina was 
under military control,

105
00:07:33,511 --> 00:07:34,344
so governments authorization was 
required to hold meetings and electoral 

106
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:39,240
act when no accident.

107
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:40,133
Sure.

108
00:07:42,450 --> 00:07:46,030
Goals per ron's campaign actions were 
almost automatically authorized.

109
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:47,440
Well,
his opponent swelled for,

110
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:50,710
let's just say the process was much 
slower and not only that,

111
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:51,544
but Peran also had complete access to 
the most important means of 

112
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:54,754
communication at the time the national 
radio station because it was owned by 

113
00:07:57,881 --> 00:07:58,714
the government,
not old man zipper on his insistence 

114
00:08:08,671 --> 00:08:09,504
that government's approved paid 
vacations for all workers as well as 

115
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:14,340
additional salary at the end of the 
year.

116
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:15,263
These are all things that make you look 
very good to your electorate and it was 

117
00:08:17,681 --> 00:08:18,514
still a move.
This genius of political strategies an 

118
00:08:20,471 --> 00:08:21,870
interest to use very well.

119
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:23,890
See,

120
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:24,723
the State Department of the United 
States itself intervenes in bronze 

121
00:08:27,401 --> 00:08:28,234
rivals,
campaigns publishing gay reports known 

122
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:30,633
as the Blue Book,
well put on his activities and those of 

123
00:08:32,531 --> 00:08:35,920
his military allies were shown to 
support the Nazi regime.

124
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:40,513
However,
brawn managed to turn this around since 

125
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:43,003
morphed into something like a struggle 
between himself who represented 

126
00:08:45,710 --> 00:08:48,110
Argentines sovereignty in the United 
States.

127
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:48,973
In the end is all these tactics copied 
to years later by populist governments 

128
00:08:51,891 --> 00:08:55,440
throughout Latin America won the 
elections for per on the victory.

129
00:08:55,441 --> 00:08:57,630
It wasn't overwhelming,
but it was enough.

130
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:09,833
Very important factor.
When Kwanza Mingo Peron came to 

131
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,624
governments.
Argentina was one of the 10 most 

132
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:17,100
prosperous and richest economies in the 
wells.

133
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,590
The country.
It was even an international credits are

134
00:09:19,591 --> 00:09:22,500
countries like the United Kingdom 
actually owed him money.

135
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,440
Thanks to all of this.
The new president's had more than enough

136
00:09:25,441 --> 00:09:27,690
resources to launch his political 
program.

137
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,100
A program based on three pillars,
political sovereignty,

138
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,660
economic independence,
and social justice.

139
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:34,523
In practice,
he transforms Argentina into a kind of 

140
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,510
army under the command of a single 
leader.

141
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:43,830
It's president,
they'll spur on,

142
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:46,020
managed him,
nationalize a lot of companies,

143
00:09:46,021 --> 00:09:49,350
especially those related to public 
services such as transport,

144
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:50,213
energy and communications.
He also plays to banking under 

145
00:09:52,591 --> 00:09:55,980
governmental control into proved a lot 
of foreign trade restriction

146
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,860
and he also achieved a lot of popular 
support.

147
00:10:01,861 --> 00:10:03,060
So how did he do it?
Well,

148
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:07,590
he did it by maintaining utility rates 
even below that cost and hiring a lot of

149
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,440
employees for the governments.
And for governmental companies,

150
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:11,333
and it's certainly not so much of a 
coincidence that the coach and has 60 

151
00:10:13,621 --> 00:10:16,050
years later,
I did practically the same thing.

152
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:16,943
Of course,
all of this involved a lot of spending 

153
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:20,670
and well,
how do you think he financed it?

154
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:21,693
Of course he started printing your money
and this is where the addiction of 

155
00:10:26,251 --> 00:10:29,430
Argentinian politicians printing bills 
came from.

156
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:38,850
The fact is that during the first years 
of this entire process,

157
00:10:38,851 --> 00:10:41,730
and thanks to all the money that he 
injected into the economy,

158
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,580
things seemed to be actually sealing 
pretty smoothly.

159
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,290
So what was the problem?
Well,

160
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:47,124
it simply wasn't sustainable.
The government over spends and the 

161
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:52,740
country's competitiveness began to sink 
like the titanic.

162
00:10:52,770 --> 00:10:54,660
Within a few years,
they're positive balance,

163
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,760
vanished.
Private investment collapsed.

164
00:10:56,761 --> 00:11:00,020
And so suddenly at some prices started 
to skyrocket.

165
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,933
Yes.

166
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,353
So what do you think happened then?
Do you think that given that his 

167
00:11:06,191 --> 00:11:08,560
revolution didn't seem to be on the 
right track,

168
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,300
per on foot,
take a bit of the blame?

169
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:11,200
Well,
no,

170
00:11:11,201 --> 00:11:12,370
he didn't at all.
In fact,

171
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,293
he blamed alleged speculators of 
attacking the national economy and to 

172
00:11:16,661 --> 00:11:19,030
remedy all of this,
he multiplies the government,

173
00:11:19,031 --> 00:11:19,864
controls regulated prices and 
implemented all kinds of measures that 

174
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:28,111
would even affect red distribution.
The crisis wasn't Peron's only problem.

175
00:11:28,690 --> 00:11:29,523
The 1853 constitution didn't allow for a
politician to stay in power preventing 

176
00:11:33,490 --> 00:11:36,460
an immediate reelection.
So under this scenario,

177
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,630
what do you think he did?
Well,

178
00:11:37,631 --> 00:11:42,631
listen to this.
Along with the bill printing machine,

179
00:11:51,161 --> 00:11:54,700
Latin American politicians.
Second toy is constituents,

180
00:11:54,701 --> 00:11:55,960
reforms,
bands.

181
00:11:55,961 --> 00:11:56,794
Of course,
Bron was no exception in 1949 since the 

182
00:12:00,961 --> 00:12:05,100
previous constitution imposed to too 
many obstacles to on launched a complete

183
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:08,400
constitutional reform.
The new constitution placed the state is

184
00:12:08,401 --> 00:12:11,010
the fundamental pillar of Argentinian 
society.

185
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:14,293
Even in the constitution's own preamble,
the three pillars of Juan Domingo Peron 

186
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:19,340
is political thesis were included.
This,

187
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:21,830
we're supposed to be a constitution for 
all,

188
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:23,590
but let's take a look at the changes 
result.

189
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:24,653
It's

190
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,020
investments or disappeared.
The macro data just got worse.

191
00:12:29,021 --> 00:12:29,854
The country was in crisis and it's 
public companies in Argentina underwent 

192
00:12:32,801 --> 00:12:33,634
swats the Dvsa,
the Venezuelan state owned oil and 

193
00:12:36,041 --> 00:12:39,580
natural gas company underwent,
they simply weren't invested in,

194
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:43,390
so they suffered from all kinds of 
influences and in the end they were very

195
00:12:43,391 --> 00:12:47,160
unproductive and inefficient all to the 
detriment of the origin time.

196
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:52,230
Well,
it's the new model.

197
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,640
Domingo Peron,
the Dimsum,

198
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,410
it became a poverty making machine.
Of course,

199
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:59,380
this all happens under the enormous 
cults of this leader.

200
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,273
The reality to viewers,
the Argentine society was in crisis and 

201
00:13:02,951 --> 00:13:05,620
it was so fragmented.
There's under these circumstances,

202
00:13:05,621 --> 00:13:08,560
in September of 1955 there was a new coo
to top.

203
00:13:08,590 --> 00:13:10,750
This time it was against quantum 
domingo.

204
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,680
You got it?
Okay.

205
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:37,380
No,
look,

206
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:43,000
Moses Ninguna readiness spending 
[inaudible] [inaudible].

207
00:13:47,820 --> 00:13:49,860
It's the same time you want to get 
pixels.

208
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:53,600
Zane,
I might be thinking,

209
00:13:53,601 --> 00:13:55,640
well,
this is the ends of for wrong.

210
00:13:55,641 --> 00:13:56,474
Well,
if you think in that your actually 

211
00:13:57,501 --> 00:14:00,860
mistaken budget.
We're going to talk about all of that in

212
00:14:00,861 --> 00:14:03,290
