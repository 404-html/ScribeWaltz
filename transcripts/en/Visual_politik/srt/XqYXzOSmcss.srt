1
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,270
Heroin,
visual politic,

2
00:00:10,271 --> 00:00:11,104
we've already made several videos about 
how Venezuela is going through its 

3
00:00:13,631 --> 00:00:14,464
toughest times,
however we still need to address one of 

4
00:00:16,541 --> 00:00:17,374
the most serious consequences of the 
Bolivarian Revolution is gigantic 

5
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:21,454
failure and there's no debate here.
Venezuela is adrift with every day that 

6
00:00:28,801 --> 00:00:29,634
passes life in this country.
It just becomes harder and harder with 

7
00:00:32,521 --> 00:00:33,354
some of the highest violence,
poverty and inflation indices in the 

8
00:00:35,671 --> 00:00:36,504
worlds and with a growing drug 
trafficking and organized crime 

9
00:00:38,701 --> 00:00:39,511
industry.
Many,

10
00:00:39,511 --> 00:00:40,344
many Venezuelans condo find any 
alternative to putting some space 

11
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:43,884
between themselves and their homelands.
That is even behind the country that's 

12
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:48,204
falling apart.

13
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:49,243
Ministry,
Latina,

14
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,860
so Seattle bullied the Tara.

15
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:58,740
Well,
if you were in a situation like this,

16
00:00:58,741 --> 00:01:01,020
would any of you have any hope?
I mean,

17
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:02,213
I would certainly try to escape and 
that's exactly what more and more 

18
00:01:04,201 --> 00:01:06,660
Venezuelans are doing,
especially the youngest ones.

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:08,250
Now,
some of you might be wondering,

20
00:01:08,251 --> 00:01:08,971
well,
okay Simon,

21
00:01:08,971 --> 00:01:11,550
but how big is this problem?
In reality,

22
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:12,413
what you see,
according to the UN's calculations from 

23
00:01:13,981 --> 00:01:14,814
2014 to June of 2018,
around at two point 3 million 

24
00:01:18,841 --> 00:01:21,780
Venezuelans left their country and these
numbers,

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,330
they're not gonna.
Stop from growing anytime soon.

26
00:01:24,440 --> 00:01:29,000
See when total of one I see.
Let me see.

27
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:31,830
Hold on the door for them.

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,300
In other words,
the Bolivarian Revolution has caused the

29
00:01:34,301 --> 00:01:37,990
greatest exodus in the history of Latin 
America,

30
00:01:38,050 --> 00:01:38,883
so listen up.

31
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,080
The exodus,

32
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:54,480
societies are entities in constant 
movement throughout history,

33
00:01:54,481 --> 00:01:55,314
migration has been continuous,
whether economic or for political 

34
00:01:58,231 --> 00:01:59,064
reasons,
to find better opportunities to escape 

35
00:02:01,081 --> 00:02:04,290
from a threat or simply to escape bad 
living conditions.

36
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:07,230
People are continually moving from one 
place to another,

37
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:08,063
not that

38
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,800
however,
an exodus is something quite different.

39
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:13,663
The term exodus refers to the mass 
immigration of people who are forced to 

40
00:02:16,551 --> 00:02:20,030
leave the place where they live.
That is to say it isn't about people who

41
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:23,600
dream of a better life,
but people who have to leave in order to

42
00:02:23,601 --> 00:02:24,830
survive.
In general,

43
00:02:24,831 --> 00:02:25,664
throughout history,
the most common causes have been 

44
00:02:26,990 --> 00:02:28,190
political,
racial,

45
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,083
or religious.
Perhaps the most common type of exodus 

46
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:31,443
throughout history has been that bite 
people forced to leave their homes 

47
00:02:33,801 --> 00:02:37,030
because another stronger group took over
and expelled them.

48
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:37,864
Violence.

49
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,473
For example,
there's the exodus of the Armenian 

50
00:02:41,801 --> 00:02:42,634
people in Nineteen 15 when hundreds of 
thousands of people were forced to 

51
00:02:45,251 --> 00:02:46,084
escape from the Turkish empire,
a process that became known as the 

52
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:49,264
Armenian genocide.
I know the case would be bass of the 

53
00:02:51,011 --> 00:02:54,310
tens of thousands of Republicans who 
faced the threat of reprisal,

54
00:02:54,311 --> 00:02:55,144
torture,
and condemnation of all kinds from the 

55
00:02:56,891 --> 00:03:00,670
frank [inaudible] and were forced to 
leave Spain the end of the Spanish civil

56
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:01,503
war or what happens in the second world 
war or with the fight for independence 

57
00:03:04,361 --> 00:03:07,330
in African and Asian countries in the 19
sixties.

58
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,873
Well,
in all times we've had two very clear 

59
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,034
examples.
The first was a product of the Syrian 

60
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:16,180
civil war,
which since its beginning in 2011,

61
00:03:16,181 --> 00:03:20,200
has driven millions of people to move 
inside and outside of its borders.

62
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,093
The second case is that a Venezuelan,
then everything indicates that it's 

63
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:28,921
exodus will end up being much,
much bigger than serious at this moment.

64
00:03:29,081 --> 00:03:29,914
The migration of Venezuelans should be 
described as a forced migration as it's 

65
00:03:33,641 --> 00:03:36,100
not planned.
It's for survival.

66
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,053
Beatrice Borgess,
executive director of the Justice and 

67
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:41,643
Peace Center in Venezuela because folks,
we need to understand what's happening 

68
00:03:44,171 --> 00:03:45,004
here,
understand that the hundreds of 

69
00:03:46,241 --> 00:03:48,340
thousands of Venezuelans who are 
escaping,

70
00:03:48,341 --> 00:03:50,950
they don't do it for pleasure,
they do it out of necessity,

71
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,230
and unlike the examples we've covered 
here,

72
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,064
the Venezuelan exodus isn't the result 
of a war or the occupation of a foreign 

73
00:03:57,161 --> 00:03:57,994
force,
but have the hunger fear and the misery 

74
00:04:00,161 --> 00:04:02,200
caused by the Bolivarian Revolution.

75
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:05,953
You see,
according to the mass living condition 

76
00:04:07,311 --> 00:04:11,150
survey in 2018,
87 percent of Venezuelans living poverty

77
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:13,940
and more than 60 percent in extreme 
poverty.

78
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,630
These are sub Saharan African numbers.

79
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:17,573
Yes.

80
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,543
The paradox is that this humanitarian 
catastrophe is happening in one of the 

81
00:04:22,371 --> 00:04:24,920
most important oil powers in the world.

82
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,550
Folks,
the situation,

83
00:04:28,551 --> 00:04:30,860
it's beginning to get real serious.
For example,

84
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:33,680
due to a lack of medicine and health 
equipment within the country,

85
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:35,900
diseases such as measles,
tuberculosis,

86
00:04:35,901 --> 00:04:36,734
and malaria.
Diseases that have been eradicated in 

87
00:04:38,661 --> 00:04:39,494
the country haven't only reemerged in 
some cases they've become real 

88
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:44,720
epidemics,
ends what's more,

89
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,530
there are more than 100,000 HIV AIDS 
patients at risk due to a lack of access

90
00:04:51,441 --> 00:04:52,274
to necessary medication.
United Nations Office for the 

91
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,173
Coordination of human affairs,
and of course this lack of medicine has 

92
00:04:58,761 --> 00:05:01,370
lethal consequences for the population,
but that's not all.

93
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,263
Venezuela is experiencing such a huge 
production and supply problem that it's 

94
00:05:05,871 --> 00:05:09,410
becoming increasingly difficult to 
acquire basic food products.

95
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,273
For example,
the can of tuna can cost more than a 

96
00:05:12,021 --> 00:05:15,800
minimum wage salary.
That athletics explains why according to

97
00:05:15,801 --> 00:05:18,110
data from the United Nations where ideas
Datto,

98
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,953
Qbo and the rest of the regime,
John's a growing fat lobster dinners 

99
00:05:22,340 --> 00:05:26,180
around one and a half million 
Venezuelans are currently suffering from

100
00:05:26,181 --> 00:05:31,181
malnutrition and then there's the 
violence issue,

101
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:36,530
which is also no joke.
Homicide statistics for example,

102
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:40,220
are out levels typical of a country in a
civil war.

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,520
Check this out and then there's of 
course robberies,

104
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:48,603
losing extortion,
and all the other crimes that have made 

105
00:05:50,741 --> 00:05:54,280
this country a very dangerous place to 
live and the Bolivarian Place.

106
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:55,640
They don't help listen

107
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:58,120
more than percent

108
00:05:58,180 --> 00:05:59,560
of the crimes.
In July,

109
00:05:59,590 --> 00:06:04,030
we're committed by police officials,
Venezuelan observatory of violence,

110
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:04,923
so faced with this scenario,
we can't be surprised that just in the 

111
00:06:07,211 --> 00:06:08,044
last three years,
2 million Venezuelans have left the 

112
00:06:10,031 --> 00:06:12,370
country by sea and land

113
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,333
that's

114
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,010
surely you've all seen the huge rows of 
Venezuelans walking step by step towards

115
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:24,330
the border because most of those who 
flee on foot or sometimes take buses,

116
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:25,320
calls,
mules,

117
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:28,290
but lately many have begun simply 
walking to Columbia,

118
00:06:28,350 --> 00:06:29,183
Brazil,
and Ecuador first and then maybe from 

119
00:06:30,871 --> 00:06:32,970
that of hurry,
Chile or Argentina.

120
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,250
Of course,
this is not an easy trip.

121
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:40,940
The journey is hard not only because of 
how tiring it isn't because of what they

122
00:06:40,941 --> 00:06:43,130
leave behind families,
friends in their homes,

123
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:43,964
but in many cases,
these refugees fall victim to 

124
00:06:45,741 --> 00:06:48,590
fraudsters,
thieves until the nefarious characters.

125
00:06:48,620 --> 00:06:49,453
Fortunately so far,
the other Latin American countries have 

126
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,244
shown great solidarity and have allowed 
almost unrestricted entry to the 

127
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:57,860
hundreds of thousands of Venezuelans.
However,

128
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:58,723
this could all change.
Receiving so many people at once isn't 

129
00:07:01,041 --> 00:07:01,874
always easy,
especially if the recipients on exactly 

130
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:08,681
rich countries,
huge pressure

131
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:15,413
folks.

132
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:16,283
It's true,
some Latin American countries are 

133
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:21,360
beginning to feel a lot of pressure.
The Venezuelan exodus is so great.

134
00:07:21,361 --> 00:07:24,540
Then in some cases they're facing 
serious capacity problems.

135
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:27,180
For example,
in the border stage of Reimer in Brazil,

136
00:07:27,181 --> 00:07:28,014
the number of Venezuelans attending 
medical centers has increased from 700 

137
00:07:31,471 --> 00:07:36,471
in 2014 to more than 50,000 in 2017 just
in the first three months of 2018.

138
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:40,943
The number reached over 45,000 every day
around seven to 800 Venezuelans cross 

139
00:07:47,221 --> 00:07:48,054
the border and that's creating a lot of 
trouble for their vaccination and 

140
00:07:50,521 --> 00:07:52,470
organization.
Michel Temer,

141
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:53,423
president of Brazil in Columbia,
the number of Venezuelans already 

142
00:07:56,161 --> 00:07:58,230
exceeds 1 million people.
In Peru,

143
00:07:58,231 --> 00:08:02,190
there are more than $400,000 in Ecuador.
It's almost a quarter of a million.

144
00:08:02,370 --> 00:08:03,203
The way this is so big that in 2018,
so far more than 4,000 Venezuelans have 

145
00:08:07,021 --> 00:08:09,360
arrived in Ecuador every day.
Of course,

146
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:12,120
many of them go onto other countries,
countries like Chile,

147
00:08:12,121 --> 00:08:16,980
which in the first six months between 
January and June received almost 150,000

148
00:08:16,981 --> 00:08:19,290
Venezuelans.
All of this is causing the most effected

149
00:08:19,291 --> 00:08:20,124
countries to begin establishing some 
measures to reduce this huge flow of 

150
00:08:22,741 --> 00:08:25,750
people.
The Brazilian government,

151
00:08:25,751 --> 00:08:26,584
for example,
has announced the deployment of the 

152
00:08:27,971 --> 00:08:28,804
military at the border and just stated 
that it will consider establishing 

153
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:31,924
quotas that is a maximum number of 
people who can enter the country for 

154
00:08:34,811 --> 00:08:39,190
their past Ecuador and Peru have begun 
to demand the presentation of passports.

155
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:40,420
And why is that?
Well,

156
00:08:40,421 --> 00:08:41,254
that's because possible.
It's not exactly easy to obtain and 

157
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:45,130
Nicolas Maduro,
Venezuela because for one,

158
00:08:45,131 --> 00:08:45,964
there's a bureaucratic labyrinth and 
also the simple facts that the 

159
00:08:48,071 --> 00:08:50,470
government lacks.
The paper needed to actually print.

160
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:53,563
Oh,
and then there's little say the Fang 

161
00:08:54,161 --> 00:08:54,994
that because many officials do great 
business by selling possibles on the 

162
00:08:57,571 --> 00:08:59,640
black market where a simple 
possibilities,

163
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:00,503
official price is only about the 
equivalent of twenty cents can cost 

164
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:03,954
between $705,500 depending on how 
quickly you need us or how much money 

165
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:10,764
the buyer has

166
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:15,930
the new face or face to own new.

167
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:22,270
And for those who are lucky enough to 
already have a passport when it expires,

168
00:09:22,271 --> 00:09:23,104
they can extend its validity for two 
more years with a stamp because they 

169
00:09:25,571 --> 00:09:28,090
won't get another passport.
But even so,

170
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,550
getting that stamp,
unless you go through the black market,

171
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:32,290
can take up to three months

172
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:38,503
chocolate

173
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:41,723
anyway,
that's the way things are for the first 

174
00:09:43,141 --> 00:09:43,974
time.
Last in America is facing a serious 

175
00:09:45,271 --> 00:09:47,520
problem with its borders and it's not an
easy problem.

176
00:09:47,550 --> 00:09:48,383
On the one hand,
you can't prevent Venezuelans from 

177
00:09:50,161 --> 00:09:50,994
coming in.
It's a humanitarian issue and there's 

178
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:55,260
still a huge margin of refugees to 
citizens,

179
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,600
but it's evidence that if things go on 
like this,

180
00:09:57,601 --> 00:10:00,330
more and more people will try to escape 
the country.

181
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:01,283
And that's quite a challenge here.
Every Latin American country needs to 

182
00:10:04,321 --> 00:10:05,154
work in a coordinated manner and receive
support from the international 

183
00:10:07,831 --> 00:10:09,150
community.
Of course,

184
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,043
to be fatty acid and solidarity shown by
many of the regions countries has been 

185
00:10:13,261 --> 00:10:14,094
extraordinary.
It's been an incredible example of that 

186
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:17,400
in unity.
And by the way,

187
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:18,234
one final note here isn't really common.
Venezuelans who were leaving in recent 

188
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:22,343
years,
many Venezuelans who made a fortune 

189
00:10:23,281 --> 00:10:24,114
during the bolivarian revolution,
dark period as well as the families of 

190
00:10:26,821 --> 00:10:29,160
many high ranking officials if also 
left,

191
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:31,050
and of course they've done it with a 
full wallet.

192
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,920
Former ministers of Chavez hit 2 billion
euros and on Dora the opulent landing of

193
00:10:39,001 --> 00:10:39,834
Venezuelan millionaires in Spain,
a dozen businessman and former top 

194
00:10:43,531 --> 00:10:46,230
officials,
some of them detained for corruption,

195
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:51,090
have invested tens of millions in luxury
real estate and hunting ranches.

196
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:51,983
These are known as Bala Chicos and we're
going to try and do a video about them 

197
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,310
in the future,
but for now it's your turn.

198
00:10:56,311 --> 00:10:57,144
Do you think that the international 
community should help the Venezuelan 

199
00:10:59,401 --> 00:11:00,600
people more?
Well,
