1
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:09,543
Two thousand and 17 is the year that 
Canada celebrates 150 years of 

2
00:00:13,361 --> 00:00:18,361
existence.
The specific day of their birth date was

3
00:00:22,511 --> 00:00:24,130
the first of July.
So.

4
00:00:24,131 --> 00:00:26,260
Well happy belated birthday

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:27,153
Canada.

6
00:00:29,770 --> 00:00:33,820
Well did you at 150 years of existence 
is not the only matter.

7
00:00:33,821 --> 00:00:34,654
We should be congratulating Canada on 
the country reached its One hundred and 

8
00:00:37,631 --> 00:00:38,464
50th anniversary in great shape because.
Well if there's something we can say 

9
00:00:42,251 --> 00:00:46,260
about Canada right now,
it's the country certainly in low.

10
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:47,203
Okay.

11
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:51,503
And yes.
Canada is also the homelands of many 

12
00:00:52,881 --> 00:00:54,950
celebrities that we all know.
Well,

13
00:01:03,040 --> 00:01:06,550
Mazda has been one celebrity who has 
been putting the international political

14
00:01:06,551 --> 00:01:09,390
spotlight.
We're of course talking about Justin.

15
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:12,870
Oh No,
no,

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,101
no,
no,

17
00:01:13,101 --> 00:01:13,270
no,

18
00:01:13,270 --> 00:01:13,961
no,
no,

19
00:01:13,961 --> 00:01:14,890
no.
Not that.

20
00:01:14,891 --> 00:01:16,360
Justin.
We met this one.

21
00:01:16,361 --> 00:01:18,100
Of course,
Justin Trudeau.

22
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:22,483
It has reached its 150th birthday as one
of the richest countries in the world 

23
00:01:25,821 --> 00:01:26,654
with a top notch quality of life as well
as being one of the most admired 

24
00:01:29,271 --> 00:01:31,910
countries on earth.
Certainly not bad.

25
00:01:31,911 --> 00:01:32,744
Right?
So now you might be wondering what is 

26
00:01:34,341 --> 00:01:35,174
the cause of all of this?
What are the main achievements that 

27
00:01:36,771 --> 00:01:40,490
Canada is celebrating after 150 years,
and importantly,

28
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:41,383
why is there a dark side to Canada?
We're going to answer all of these 

29
00:01:44,181 --> 00:01:46,130
questions in this video,
but first,

30
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:48,530
let us get some perspective,

31
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:52,390
a great transformation,

32
00:01:53,810 --> 00:01:54,643
not have had much about Canada recently,
but we can certainly say that they all 

33
00:01:57,661 --> 00:01:59,580
know ordinary country.
In fact,

34
00:01:59,581 --> 00:02:00,414
Canada is the second biggest country in 
the wells with its territory covering 

35
00:02:03,491 --> 00:02:05,790
it.
Six different time zones and guess which

36
00:02:05,791 --> 00:02:07,650
country has the most coastline in the 
world?

37
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:08,970
Well,
no prizes,

38
00:02:08,971 --> 00:02:11,380
if you guessed Canada,
of course as well.

39
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:14,770
Regular visual politic view is already 
known either the size of the country,

40
00:02:14,771 --> 00:02:15,604
surface and or its coastline determines 
its wealth or how many opportunities 

41
00:02:19,351 --> 00:02:24,351
it's citizens have.
So then what's really behind the success

42
00:02:25,991 --> 00:02:27,010
on Canada?
Well,

43
00:02:27,011 --> 00:02:27,844
one key factor here is the disastrous 
years the Canada had in the late 

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,350
eighties and early nineties,

45
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,080
Canada suffered economic stagnation and 
several crises.

46
00:02:38,350 --> 00:02:43,300
These were bad enough that in 1995,
the Wall Street Journal called Canada,

47
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,223
an honorary member of the third world 
due to its inability to control 

48
00:02:48,191 --> 00:02:49,090
government accounts.

49
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:53,890
Things then as you can see,
things have changed enormously.

50
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,753
Canada really knew how to play to their 
strengths and get rid of their 

51
00:02:57,431 --> 00:03:01,030
weaknesses and especially the above.
All Canadians have really understood the

52
00:03:01,031 --> 00:03:04,060
importance and the meaning of these two 
words,

53
00:03:04,210 --> 00:03:05,043
competitiveness and integration.
After those disastrous years of the 

54
00:03:10,301 --> 00:03:11,134
eighties and nineties,
Canadians realize that before thinking 

55
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,104
about spending,
it is absolutely essential to think 

56
00:03:16,510 --> 00:03:19,810
about creating and they realized that in
order to do that,

57
00:03:19,811 --> 00:03:24,811
they needed investment businesses and 
trade a great deal of trade

58
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,160
well,
so as it was said,

59
00:03:33,161 --> 00:03:37,660
so it was done in Canada is today these 
seven freest economy in the world,

60
00:03:37,690 --> 00:03:38,523
but if we're talking about freedom,
then we can't just talk about the 

61
00:03:41,350 --> 00:03:42,183
economic side of things.
The Fraser Institute publishes every 

62
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:45,783
year,
something called the Human Freedom 

63
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,453
Index.
This measures both the economic and the 

64
00:03:49,761 --> 00:03:52,300
civil freedoms that people enjoy.
Quite simply,

65
00:03:52,301 --> 00:03:53,134
it measures what we can't do and what we
can't so well according to their 

66
00:03:56,651 --> 00:03:59,860
research.
Canada is the freest country on earth.

67
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,560
To give you a better idea of how this 
compares to some other countries.

68
00:04:02,561 --> 00:04:03,460
Well,
the USA,

69
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:04,840
they ranked 23rd.
Isn't,

70
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,740
isn't it 28th and Japan is flagging and 
position 32.

71
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:14,260
Maybe the reason for this is these 
strong decentralization that the country

72
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,094
has Canada instantly that into 10 
provinces and three territories that 

73
00:04:18,341 --> 00:04:19,174
have so many unique regulations that in 
2017 they actually had to sign a free 

74
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:24,490
trade agreement among them.

75
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:30,220
You interprovincial trade deal expected 
to add billions to the economy.

76
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,273
I think decentralization is absolutely 
enormous and it is traditionally 

77
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:38,620
resulted in higher costs for those 
companies that don't operate in a single

78
00:04:38,621 --> 00:04:39,454
region,
but in several different regions with 

79
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,630
each region having different 
regulations.

80
00:04:44,740 --> 00:04:45,573
In Ontario,
petrol must be at least five percent 

81
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,753
ethanol.
Manitoba insists on an eight point five 

82
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:52,234
percent blend.
The positive side of this is that this 

83
00:04:54,221 --> 00:04:55,054
has worked as a counterweight to the 
federal governments and it's encouraged 

84
00:04:57,761 --> 00:04:58,594
them to make pro citizen policies,
and that's something that has driven 

85
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:02,044
good public policies anyway.
This new agreement has been created in 

86
00:05:04,541 --> 00:05:07,690
order to beat all these surprising 
obstacles further,

87
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,623
as we talked about in a previous video.
There's also the Canadian bets on 

88
00:05:11,501 --> 00:05:14,690
multiculturalism and well,
let us be relative frank here.

89
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,750
Nowadays,
this country is one of the best examples

90
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:21,751
of integration in the entire world,
but ah,

91
00:05:25,310 --> 00:05:30,310
the Canadian mosaic,
but also this Canadian multiculturalism.

92
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:32,350
And what's it all really about?
Well,

93
00:05:32,351 --> 00:05:36,550
basically it consists of accepting that 
cultural diversity is not a threat,

94
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,700
but it's an asset and a source of 
opportunities for a country.

95
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:40,481
Now,
of course,

96
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:44,320
this multiculturalism is always 
subordinate to a core set of values such

97
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:47,170
as democracy,
such as the rule of law and equality for

98
00:05:47,171 --> 00:05:48,004
all people.

99
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:49,910
Yup.
Nope.

100
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:53,470
This needs that in order to be Canadian 
and be welcomed into their country,

101
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:54,423
you don't have to replace your culture 
with any other like the Canadian 

102
00:05:57,471 --> 00:05:58,304
culture.
You just have to accept and commit to 

103
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:02,780
those core Canadian values.
I mean,

104
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,620
Canada has one of the largest 
populations of immigrants in the world.

105
00:06:06,621 --> 00:06:09,290
One out of every five Canadians weren't 
born in Canada.

106
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,200
I mean,
for some cities like Toronto,

107
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,250
this figure it grows up to 50 percent or
even higher and it seems that it will be

108
00:06:16,251 --> 00:06:17,084
even higher in the future because every 
year more than 300,000 new immigrants 

109
00:06:20,691 --> 00:06:21,524
come to this country,
which is one of the highest immigration 

110
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:26,330
rates in the entire world.
And you know,

111
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:28,190
the result of all of this is,
do you think is the problem?

112
00:06:28,191 --> 00:06:28,701
Well,
it's.

113
00:06:28,701 --> 00:06:30,950
It's actually no problem at all.
Yeah.

114
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:31,784
Look,
as we said in that previous video 

115
00:06:32,541 --> 00:06:35,060
integration in Canada,
it's certainly not for free.

116
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:38,600
There's the system that exists that's 
based on three fundamental pillars,

117
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:41,630
points,
family reunification and refugees.

118
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,520
The most important one of these is the 
points based system.

119
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,880
This exists do grants people,
residents or work permits.

120
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,160
It considers things like having a job 
offer,

121
00:06:54,161 --> 00:06:54,994
which is the most important thing,
or also maybe having a degree or having 

122
00:06:57,881 --> 00:06:58,810
the ability to speak

123
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:00,490
English and

124
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:03,680
I know the results of these policies.
Well,

125
00:07:03,681 --> 00:07:04,514
almost 80 percent of Canadians think 
that immigration is good for the 

126
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:07,844
economy.
This is something that really shouldn't 

127
00:07:09,141 --> 00:07:13,250
be so strange when you consider that all
the statistics show that immigrants,

128
00:07:13,251 --> 00:07:15,950
the brands,
new Canadians are more educated,

129
00:07:15,951 --> 00:07:19,100
they work more hours,
they create more businesses as they draw

130
00:07:19,101 --> 00:07:22,490
less dollars from social programs.
Now the question might be,

131
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,353
does Canada have,
does it have any rules about 

132
00:07:24,771 --> 00:07:26,930
immigration?
Certainly it does,

133
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:30,080
but this sort of welcoming culture 
focused on integration.

134
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:31,250
Well,
it's pretty Rad.

135
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:36,670
Exactly.

136
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,630
Nineteen,
77.

137
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:42,690
Every Canadian citizen can hold any 
other nationality without restriction,

138
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:45,940
so when someone immigrates to Canada 
arounds after some years they can obtain

139
00:07:45,941 --> 00:07:46,774
the Canadian passport.
They don't have to renounce their 

140
00:07:48,641 --> 00:07:49,474
previous nationality,
but if something might perfectly show 

141
00:07:52,241 --> 00:07:56,050
Canada spirits,
well that would be Prime Minister Justin

142
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,270
Trudeau.

143
00:07:56,270 --> 00:07:59,060
Hi everyone.
I'm Justin Trudeau.

144
00:08:06,490 --> 00:08:07,710
Yes.

145
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:10,400
Didn't Trudeau a political star?

146
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:13,773
Didn't he die?
He took office in 2015 almost buying 

147
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,730
surprise and that just 44 years vein 
today.

148
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:22,510
He is one of the most popular 
politicians in the world and that's true

149
00:08:22,511 --> 00:08:25,060
in Canada as well.
This is something that the Poles

150
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,253
clearly show a recent survey by abacus 
data on the leadership of the prime 

151
00:08:30,731 --> 00:08:31,564
minister shows that 70 percent of 
Canadians are confident that Trudeau 

152
00:08:35,051 --> 00:08:38,800
will successfully manage Canada's 
relations with its allies.

153
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:42,220
Sixty three percent trust his 
responsibility to make decisions,

154
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:45,940
and 62 percent believed that his 
decisions will be good ones.

155
00:08:46,630 --> 00:08:47,463
I mean,
how many politicians around the world 

156
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:51,230
would really like approval?
Rating is like those.

157
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:54,400
We need a leader.
However,

158
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:56,010
Trudeau,
he's not a typical

159
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:57,510
politician,
not at all.

160
00:08:57,540 --> 00:08:59,270
The Prime Minister of Canada has 
personal,

161
00:08:59,271 --> 00:09:00,540
a table,
a program,

162
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,393
and the form of government that's really
quite different from what's typically 

163
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:06,330
being used and when you look at his 
cabinet,

164
00:09:06,331 --> 00:09:09,120
I mean it's a realistic sample of 
Canada's reality.

165
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:12,210
Hey,
cabinet looks like Canada.

166
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:14,953
10 of the 30 ministers are women.
There's even an Afghanistan veteran and 

167
00:09:18,741 --> 00:09:21,560
an individual who is formerly a 
volunteer in Niger.

168
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:25,340
There also business executives and even 
some ministers who are Sikhs,

169
00:09:25,341 --> 00:09:28,330
which is a religion native to the Punjab
state in.

170
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:29,363
Yeah.

171
00:09:31,090 --> 00:09:32,860
The latest addition to that,
and they by the way,

172
00:09:32,861 --> 00:09:36,820
has been who sent a Somali,
who arrived to Canada as a refugee at 16

173
00:09:36,821 --> 00:09:39,910
years old and is now the minister of 
integration.

174
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:41,020
Pretty amazing.
Alright,

175
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:41,943
today's political priorities.
Well there is international as these 

176
00:09:43,971 --> 00:09:44,804
cabinets.
One of the government of Canada is key 

177
00:09:45,941 --> 00:09:48,550
challenges is to boost trade among 
nations.

178
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,690
Now pay attention to that foreign 
affairs,

179
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,220
right?

180
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,053
Trade barriers hurt the people.
They are intended to help the curb 

181
00:09:57,001 --> 00:09:59,940
growth,
stifle innovation and kill employment.

182
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:02,820
This is a lesson we should learn from 
history.

183
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:07,230
This is why Trudeau wants to sign a free
trade agreements with China.

184
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:09,270
Secondly,
unlike other governments to do,

185
00:10:09,310 --> 00:10:10,143
doesn't just reject protectionism,
but he wants to stimulate a productive 

186
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,410
change with artificial intelligence and 
automation.

187
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,273
I mean why you can do technology if 
there's something we've seen as history 

188
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,023
has progressed,
is that technology improves people's 

189
00:10:23,071 --> 00:10:25,130
lives and to create some more jobs.

190
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:32,240
Not seeing something like that is too 
complicated to do,

191
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:33,074
but the reality is that there are not 
many world leaders who defend this pro 

192
00:10:35,931 --> 00:10:38,900
technology position talking about jobs 
going away.

193
00:10:39,170 --> 00:10:40,003
It's not exactly a popular line.
The other great challenge and maybe the 

194
00:10:42,591 --> 00:10:43,424
key value of Trudeau's government is 
that bets on boosting civil rights and 

195
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:50,540
sending Canada into an international 
example of how this should be done.

196
00:10:50,570 --> 00:10:52,700
Take a look at the power of this 
picture.

197
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,880
Trudeau has become the first prime 
minister to lead an Lgbtq pride parade.

198
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,320
There's also the most recently released 
program,

199
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:03,290
Canada's feminist international 
assistance policy.

200
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,161
Yep.
You heard that right.

201
00:11:04,161 --> 00:11:04,994
Trudeau's government didn't hesitate to 
declare itself feminist and among other 

202
00:11:07,851 --> 00:11:08,684
things,
they have decided to do focus and most 

203
00:11:09,741 --> 00:11:10,574
of their international cooperation 
budgets on pushing winans rights where 

204
00:11:13,341 --> 00:11:15,500
they are most needed,
no this,

205
00:11:15,501 --> 00:11:16,334
it's just a symbol,
but sometimes symbols that pretty 

206
00:11:18,321 --> 00:11:19,154
important.
Other symbols and gestures are is 

207
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,400
positioned towards Syrian refugees and 
pay close attention to this speech.

208
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,333
In recent months,
Canadians have opened their hearts and 

209
00:11:29,191 --> 00:11:30,024
their arms to families fleeing the 
ongoing conflict in Syria and from the 

210
00:11:33,811 --> 00:11:34,644
moment they arrived,
those 31,000 refugees were welcomed not 

211
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:41,820
as burdens,
but as neighbors and friends.

212
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:43,440
As new Canadian

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:45,090
today state

214
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:48,500
40,000 Syrian refugees have arrived in 
Canada.

215
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:49,393
Almost half of them,
thanks to the sponsorship of Canadian 

216
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,040
citizens had committed to be responsible

217
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:59,040
and looking after their wellness.
This is a great example of solidarity.

218
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:00,903
I mean,
it's one thing being kind and generous 

219
00:12:02,861 --> 00:12:03,490
and.
Well,

220
00:12:03,490 --> 00:12:06,940
it's quite another to be naive.
Bus consider this.

221
00:12:06,970 --> 00:12:07,803
The Canadian government has announced 
its intention to increase military 

222
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:13,420
spending by more than 70 percent from 
now until 20,

223
00:12:13,421 --> 00:12:17,770
24 in order to create a more agile and 
modern armed forces.

224
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,613
Yes.

225
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:24,730
Trains,
doors open to technology integration,

226
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:26,110
civil rights,
security,

227
00:12:26,170 --> 00:12:29,090
all these things don't sound bad at all,
right?

228
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:30,093
Especially if you consider that this 
government understands that before 

229
00:12:32,561 --> 00:12:36,880
starting to discuss spending,
you have to talk about wealth creation.

230
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,950
Well,
I mean that's how Canada has reached its

231
00:12:38,951 --> 00:12:41,500
One hundred and 50th anniversary.
Everything.

232
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:42,850
Bloody Marvelous,
right?

233
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:44,290
Well,
wait a second.

234
00:12:44,291 --> 00:12:45,610
I mean not exactly.
Yeah,

235
00:12:45,650 --> 00:12:46,483
there are certainly some shadows,
but we're actually gonna have to leave 

236
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:49,714
those for another video.
Something we're probably going to call 

237
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,294
the dark side of Canada.
Don't think that it's all just rainbows 

238
00:12:54,911 --> 00:12:57,220
and butterflies in Canada.
Certainly not.

239
00:12:57,250 --> 00:12:58,360
Not at all.
Well,

240
00:12:58,361 --> 00:12:59,194

other side of the story and now we'd 

242
00:13:05,471 --> 00:13:08,020
