1
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:09,383
I think nobody will be surprised if I 
say that immigration is one of the most 

2
00:00:11,821 --> 00:00:12,654
important issues in international 
politics and certainly both in Europe 

3
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:17,394
and in the United States lately.
Everything related to this issue takes 

4
00:00:21,181 --> 00:00:24,360
over most of the news and the front 
pages of the newspapers.

5
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,290
Immigration was the fault.
All of the problems that were happening.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,333
What the administration has decided to 
do is to separate children from their 

7
00:00:33,721 --> 00:00:38,721
parents to try to send a message that if
you crossed the border with children,

8
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:41,880
your children are going to be ripped 
away from you.

9
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:42,773
That's traumatizing to the children for 
innocent victims and it is contrary to 

10
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:49,403
our values and this country.
The United States will not be a migrant 

11
00:00:53,701 --> 00:00:58,701
camp and it will not be a refugee 
holding facility will be because will be

12
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,370
able to push that open door space at 
Columbia when she got down to granted.

13
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:20,260
Granted all window,
not deep

14
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,790
without going any further.
Here are visual politic.

15
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:25,643
We've already spoken a few times about 
this objects and soon we're going to 

16
00:01:28,491 --> 00:01:29,324
post a special video first on our 
Patrion and then on youtube commenting 

17
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:35,114
and dismantling.
Many of the myths and half truths that 

18
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:38,623
exist on this subject,
and just before we get into the meat of 

19
00:01:40,941 --> 00:01:42,440
today's video,
speaking of Patriot on,

20
00:01:42,441 --> 00:01:43,274
let me thank everyone who is supporting 
us on Patrion and everyone who just 

21
00:01:45,561 --> 00:01:48,320
watches us whereabouts across the half 
million subscriber mark,

22
00:01:48,321 --> 00:01:51,290
so that's pretty amazing and we couldn't
do that without you,

23
00:01:51,291 --> 00:01:54,890
especially the people who do support us.
Like I say on Patrion.

24
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,753
Because of that,
we are now publishing 50 percent more 

25
00:01:57,381 --> 00:02:01,400
videos and we're now preparing lots of 
surprises and of course all of the other

26
00:02:01,401 --> 00:02:03,290
things that we have promised you,
but for now,

27
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,153
let's just crack on you at this time.
I'd like to share some reflections with 

28
00:02:19,741 --> 00:02:20,574
you,
some ideas which I think we should keep 

29
00:02:22,531 --> 00:02:24,720
in mind when we're talking about 
immigration.

30
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,410
This is particularly important.
If we consider that lately mistrust,

31
00:02:28,411 --> 00:02:30,920
fear and anti-immigration,
political speeches.

32
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,390
Well,
the very much alive

33
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,133
get out of my country,
I can still hear that sentence with 

34
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,190
absolute clarity as if it occupies a 
specific place in my mind.

35
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,650
It's a scar deep within.
The man who said,

36
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:46,500
get out of my country was a trump 
supporter.

37
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:51,270
I know this because he was wearing a pin
identifying the then candidate on one of

38
00:02:51,271 --> 00:02:52,770
his lapels,
but most of all,

39
00:02:52,890 --> 00:02:54,900
I know this because of the way he said 
it to me.

40
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,290
He looked me straight in the eyes,
pointed a finger at me and shouted,

41
00:02:58,430 --> 00:03:00,280
or he a journalist

42
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:03,100
from univision and a US citizen who was 
born in Mexico.

43
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:03,993
One of the most typical and popular 
arguments of those who oppose 

44
00:03:06,941 --> 00:03:11,200
immigration is stating that immigrants 
take odd jobs and take the money back to

45
00:03:11,201 --> 00:03:12,790
their own countries.
You know,

46
00:03:12,850 --> 00:03:15,010
as long as we're not talking about messy
you Christiane,

47
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,853
or analogy,
I know doll or maybe the writing stones 

48
00:03:17,770 --> 00:03:20,290
there.
Of course there's no problem,

49
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,960
which is perhaps a bit hypocritical,
don't you think?

50
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,160
So now we come to the question,
well,

51
00:03:24,161 --> 00:03:29,140
why do people decide to emigrate?
Who are these people who pack their bags

52
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:30,003
and leave their land?
Who benefits from all of these 

53
00:03:31,631 --> 00:03:32,740
movements?
And in general,

54
00:03:32,741 --> 00:03:36,280
why is that such a negative perception 
of this phenomenon?

55
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:37,173
Well then this video,
I'm going to try and answer some of 

56
00:03:38,831 --> 00:03:39,664
those questions,
but first I think it's time we took a 

57
00:03:41,741 --> 00:03:44,200
look back at how it all began,
when,

58
00:03:44,260 --> 00:03:45,580
why,
and where.

59
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:48,460
By the way,
what would you say if I told you that in

60
00:03:48,461 --> 00:03:51,880
some way your also an immigrants?
Well,

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:52,803
listen up.
The origin from the very beginnings of 

62
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,700
humanity,
people moved.

63
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,573
Basically their motivation was to find 
food which forced them to move 

64
00:04:11,551 --> 00:04:14,310
continuously from one place to another.
Of course,

65
00:04:14,311 --> 00:04:15,144
back then borders didn't exist.
The only limitation to moving from one 

66
00:04:18,421 --> 00:04:21,510
place to another with how far one could 
travel.

67
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:25,763
Of course,
all this began to change when modern 

68
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:28,583
societies emerged.
That is when communities settled in a 

69
00:04:31,141 --> 00:04:31,974
particular place where they worked to 
produce food tools and everything they 

70
00:04:35,281 --> 00:04:36,930
needed to trade to live.

71
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:41,630
No.

72
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:46,370
One thing we can ask ourselves here is,
did the migration phenomenon disappeared

73
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:48,770
with this new way of life?
Well,

74
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,663
no,
not at all.

75
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:57,170
Once the first modern societies 
established themselves in certain places

76
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,800
and governments began to emerge back 
around 3000 BC,

77
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,663
migration didn't stop.
All the motivations did change to large 

78
00:05:06,111 --> 00:05:08,360
migration groups were created,
so to speak,

79
00:05:08,361 --> 00:05:10,760
to groups with really different 
motivations.

80
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:13,360
On the one hand that was conquering and 
on the other hands,

81
00:05:13,370 --> 00:05:15,060
there was searching for opportunities.

82
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:16,860
Yes,

83
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:20,333
the first conquest swerve movements 
carried out by societies that had 

84
00:05:23,131 --> 00:05:23,964
achieved a higher level of developments 
and who wanted to take advantage of it 

85
00:05:26,731 --> 00:05:28,880
to gain wealth from the people they call
it

86
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,793
good

87
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,473
involved a migratory movement from the 
most developed countries to the less 

88
00:05:38,751 --> 00:05:41,230
developed countries to monopolize their 
resources.

89
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:46,750
Although this phenomenon wasn't 
exclusive to any continent,

90
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:47,613
the case that we all know best is 
perhaps that of the Europeans who 

91
00:05:50,801 --> 00:05:55,030
managed to control almost the entire 
world starting with America,

92
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:56,680
of course,
this type of migration,

93
00:05:56,710 --> 00:05:59,660
it doesn't look anything like the 
migration that we have today.

94
00:05:59,690 --> 00:06:02,480
The second type of migration though it 
certainly does.

95
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:03,343
We're talking about the peaceful 
mobilization of millions of people who 

96
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:06,583
seek to escape that territory of origin 
to reach another territory where they 

97
00:06:10,071 --> 00:06:15,071
can find new and better opportunities.
In this case,

98
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:16,244
their drive is to search for economic 
improvements and sometimes also to 

99
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:22,130
escape political and religious 
persecution.

100
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:23,540
Therefore,
in general,

101
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:24,374
we're talking about peaceful migrations 
from the least developed countries to 

102
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,753
the most developed countries,
which is something like the opposite of 

103
00:06:31,581 --> 00:06:36,581
conquest.
The first launch case happens at the end

104
00:06:38,350 --> 00:06:39,183
of the Middle Ages when cities grew and 
people began to leave the country side 

105
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,430
to move to these cities.
In many case this,

106
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,293
it was a really slow process,
but everything changed with the arrival 

107
00:06:49,750 --> 00:06:54,750
of the industrial revolution.
It's estimated between 1850 and 1930,

108
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:00,354
almost $60 million Europeans,
which was a huge percentage of the 

109
00:07:03,331 --> 00:07:06,780
population at that time,
emigrated to the Americas countries like

110
00:07:06,781 --> 00:07:07,950
the US,
Canada,

111
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:09,240
Brazil,
and Argentina.

112
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,690
That's is

113
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:14,693
to say,
despite all the political discourse 

114
00:07:16,191 --> 00:07:17,024
against immigration,
the truth is that Europe has a well 

115
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:21,650
defined history as an emigrant 
territory.

116
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,790
Europeans first emigrated massively from
the countryside to the cities.

117
00:07:25,791 --> 00:07:29,240
Then they moved around the wells and is 
now in our times.

118
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:30,103
Millions and millions of Europeans have 
left their lands to live in another 

119
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:34,993
European Union country.

120
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:40,290
And what about the United States?
Almost all of its population,

121
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:41,183
if not all of it,
comes from other countries or lives in 

122
00:07:43,170 --> 00:07:45,420
territories that belonged to other 
countries,

123
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:47,570
as is the case of the lands of 
California,

124
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,700
New Mexico and Texas,
which historically belonged to Mexico.

125
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,400
So in a way we're all really the 
descendants of immigrants.

126
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:57,263
In fact,
if we take the current anti immigration 

127
00:07:58,861 --> 00:07:59,694
demonstrations TV extreme,
we could state that we are all 

128
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:05,340
immigrants in the regions in which we 
live.

129
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:07,470
Now,
the question we must ask is,

130
00:08:07,471 --> 00:08:08,304
well,
what are the consequences of all of 

131
00:08:09,181 --> 00:08:10,014
that?
Could it have something to do with the 

132
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:11,664
fact that most of the richest and most 
developed countries in the wells have 

133
00:08:14,820 --> 00:08:18,000
been exposed to the migratory process?
Well,

134
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,863
listen up,
what history tells us what's that loud 

135
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:31,444
or say a clear.
Most immigrants share a common goal to 

136
00:08:34,481 --> 00:08:37,990
achieve a better life and more progress.
It's true,

137
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,853
some people with deep pockets or a good 
standard of living move from their 

138
00:08:41,111 --> 00:08:41,944
country to grow professionally,
have new experiences or maybe just live 

139
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:48,430
differently.
These immigrants who usually arrive with

140
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:52,490
a full wallet almost never awakened 
anyone's mistrust.

141
00:08:54,470 --> 00:08:56,040
However,
same does not

142
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:59,460
apply to people who are escaping hunger,
misery,

143
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:01,530
all kinds of political,
religious,

144
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:02,364
and social prosecutions.
These are immigrants who arrive with an 

145
00:09:05,191 --> 00:09:07,890
empty wallet in search of new 
opportunities.

146
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:08,763
This type of immigration is by far the 
most important and of course the one 

147
00:09:11,521 --> 00:09:14,890
that generates the greatest mistrust,
hostility and criticism.

148
00:09:16,620 --> 00:09:17,453
However,
this immigration is almost identical to 

149
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:20,064
our ancestors.
We talking about people who are risking 

150
00:09:22,051 --> 00:09:24,980
their lives and who decided to leave 
everything behind,

151
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,530
which is certainly not easy,
and all for what?

152
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,423
Well the same as always do,
achieve a better future to work and to 

153
00:09:32,461 --> 00:09:33,870
prosper in a lawful way.

154
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:36,903
It'll is more extraordinary than the 
decision to migrate the accumulation of 

155
00:09:40,431 --> 00:09:41,264
emotions and thoughts which finally 
leads a family to say farewell to a 

156
00:09:44,481 --> 00:09:45,314
community where it has lived for 
centuries to abandon old ties and 

157
00:09:48,501 --> 00:09:53,501
familiar landmarks and to sail across.
Doc sees to a strange land.

158
00:09:53,810 --> 00:09:54,643
John F Kennedy,
president of the United States of 

159
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:56,940
America.

160
00:09:56,940 --> 00:09:57,773
Tell me who built America,
who promoted the extraordinary economic 

161
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:01,974
take off this?
Argentina saw at the end of the 19th 

162
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:05,310
century.
Well,

163
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:06,173
folks,
it was the immigrants and the 

164
00:10:07,321 --> 00:10:08,154
descendants of the immigrants,
so why do we think of things as 

165
00:10:11,161 --> 00:10:15,700
different today,
but of course,

166
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:16,534
when economic data shows that 
immigration drives growth and 

167
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:19,650
development,
do youtube,

168
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,480
higher employment levels,
entrepreneurship and productivity,

169
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:24,850
then anti-immigration critics,
well,

170
00:10:24,940 --> 00:10:25,773
they make up other excuses.
We're going to talk about them one by 

171
00:10:30,971 --> 00:10:33,250
one in a future video with data and 
hands,

172
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:34,084
but today I'd like to end this video 
with a reflection on one of the most 

173
00:10:37,691 --> 00:10:40,390
important myths,
fear and crime.

174
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:55,090
When Mexico sends its people,
they're not sending their best.

175
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,600
They're not sending you.
They're sending people that have lots of

176
00:10:58,601 --> 00:11:01,570
problems and they're bringing those 
problems with us.

177
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:04,390
They're bringing drugs,
they're bringing crime,

178
00:11:04,420 --> 00:11:05,350
they're rapists.

179
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:08,600
One of the most widely spread myths is 
that immigrants,

180
00:11:08,630 --> 00:11:11,960
especially undocumented immigrants,
the so called illegals,

181
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,380
are the ones responsible for most crimes
and delinquency.

182
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,310
Well,
you know what?

183
00:11:16,370 --> 00:11:19,130
The data actually says that the opposite
is true.

184
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:19,993
Now,
it is true that there are legal and 

185
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:23,840
illegal immigrants who commit crimes.
However,

186
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:24,703
let's look at an example.
Let's look at what happens in the 

187
00:11:26,241 --> 00:11:28,730
country with the most immigrants in the 
world.

188
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:33,810
The United States say between 1990 and 
2013,

189
00:11:34,621 --> 00:11:35,454
the number of undocumented immigrants 
known as illegal immigrants went from 

190
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:41,550
three and a half million people to 
approximately 11 million.

191
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,750
However,
in that same period,

192
00:11:42,751 --> 00:11:43,584
according to the FBI,
the number of violent crimes dropped by 

193
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:50,810
48 percent.
Surprised well,

194
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:54,550
if we take the crime data into accounts,
he really shouldn't be.

195
00:11:54,610 --> 00:11:57,190
So according to an immigration policy 
center study,

196
00:11:57,191 --> 00:12:01,560
only one point six percent of immigrant 
men aged 18 to 39 end up in prison.

197
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:06,430
Among those born in the United States,
the data is three point three percent,

198
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:10,780
so more than double Jack.
This graph on crime levels in taxes,

199
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:14,290
which is one of the states with the most
legal and illegal immigrants.

200
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,870
Yes,
we can agree that we need to reorder the

201
00:12:23,871 --> 00:12:24,704
migratory processes,
but stigmatizing immigrants and 

202
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,680
outlawing their condition only favors 
the human trafficking.

203
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,110
Matthews,
the evidence is clear.

204
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:33,944
Immigrants trying to reach countries 
with high levels of freedom and more 

205
00:12:36,561 --> 00:12:37,394
open economic systems in shorts,
places where they can work and enjoy 

206
00:12:40,881 --> 00:12:42,080
life without fear.

207
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:45,313
Therefore perhaps a good measure and 
maybe the only one to control the 

208
00:12:48,441 --> 00:12:50,750
migrator reflow.
It's a remote trade,

209
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:51,673
private investments and democratic 
institutions in the countries that 

210
00:12:54,201 --> 00:12:56,810
people are leaving,
that's meanwhile developed countries can

211
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:57,644
take advantage of immigration in the 
same way as other societies throughout 

212
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:02,170
history,
immigrants view,

213
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,033
uh,
they want to work and then wants to 

214
00:13:04,521 --> 00:13:05,354
prosper,

215
00:13:07,690 --> 00:13:07,910
right?

216
00:13:07,910 --> 00:13:08,743

The United States will not be a migrant 
camp and it will not be a refugee 

226
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:40,150
holding facility.
Won't be.
