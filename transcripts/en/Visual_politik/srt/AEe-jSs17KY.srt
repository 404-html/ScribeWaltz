1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,010
Here's a quick question and by now you 
know the rules,

2
00:00:02,011 --> 00:00:02,844
please don't google it or wikipedia it's
or whatever and the question is what do 

3
00:00:06,451 --> 00:00:07,284
you know about Armenia?
What do you really know about this 

4
00:00:09,121 --> 00:00:11,950
remote country located in the caucus's 
region out?

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,730
Because Armenia has some very 
interesting traits.

6
00:00:14,731 --> 00:00:15,564
For example,
it was the first Christian country in 

7
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:18,383
all of history.
It's a chess well power I didn't even 

8
00:00:20,641 --> 00:00:25,641
has its own alphabet is another thing 
that you might not know about.

9
00:00:32,461 --> 00:00:36,030
This country inside of the country is 
not really sure how to say this,

10
00:00:36,031 --> 00:00:38,410
but essentially there's another country 
in that.

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,640
This country is the self constituted 
republic of odd sack,

12
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:45,560
formerly known as an Al Gore Cara back.
You owe that rights we're talking about,

13
00:00:45,561 --> 00:00:49,320
it's a republic that isn't recognized by
any other country in the world but which

14
00:00:49,321 --> 00:00:50,154
proclaimed its independence in 1991 and 
has its own governments' parliaments 

15
00:00:53,851 --> 00:00:56,720
constitution and even its own armed 
forces.

16
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:04,110
You'll see except for a passport with 
which they can travel the world.

17
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:07,500
They have everything of course,
this curious republic citizens,

18
00:01:07,501 --> 00:01:08,334
I'm sort of [inaudible].
They all have an Armenian passports 

19
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,070
because this country is a close ally of 
Armenia.

20
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:18,693
You see,
during the Soviet period at this 

21
00:01:19,811 --> 00:01:23,080
territory was an odd blast and 
autonomous province of the asthma,

22
00:01:23,081 --> 00:01:25,060
Shani,
Soviet socialist republic,

23
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:25,923
but when the Soviet Union collapsed it 
and the government decided that it 

24
00:01:28,301 --> 00:01:29,134
wanted to belong to Armenia,
which led to a long four year water 

25
00:01:32,620 --> 00:01:34,210
caused thousands of death.

26
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,960
Bye.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:38,601
Oh,
interesting.

28
00:01:38,601 --> 00:01:39,434
Side note here.
Have you ever noticed in history how 

29
00:01:40,791 --> 00:01:45,050
many wars have happened simply over 
eight tiny piece of lambs?

30
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:46,183
Let's stay on topic for today.
Maybe that's something we'll talk about 

31
00:01:48,291 --> 00:01:49,041
in the future.
Now,

32
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:53,240
most would agree that Armenia has 
absolutely everything required to dazzle

33
00:01:53,330 --> 00:01:55,160
a politics.
Addicts as of course,

34
00:01:55,161 --> 00:01:58,730
everything required for us to talk about
it right here on visual politic.

35
00:01:58,760 --> 00:02:03,740
One comes re inside another one and 
recent war in 2016 a huge diaspora,

36
00:02:03,741 --> 00:02:04,574
a democratic revolution,
and even the potential to be a headache 

37
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,540
for Mr Vladimir Putin himself.
So listen up.

38
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:16,913
Yeah,

39
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:21,083
with no see access,
a location surrounded by huge mountains 

40
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,910
and less than 3 million inhabitants,
I believe you are,

41
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:30,330
that we can call Armenia a pretty remote
place.

42
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,510
Okay.
If

43
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,343
we had to briefly describe this country,
we would say that it's not far off from 

44
00:02:36,661 --> 00:02:40,170
the typical Hollywood portrayal of the 
former Soviet republic.

45
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:41,250
Of course,
they want to like Hollywood.

46
00:02:41,251 --> 00:02:42,084
They don't have a rebel military,
and they certainly don't have a desire 

47
00:02:43,981 --> 00:02:44,814
to return to communism.
But the truth is that this country has 

48
00:02:46,861 --> 00:02:48,450
many,
many problems.

49
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,083
See,
Armenia gained its independence in 

50
00:02:52,261 --> 00:02:55,500
September of 1991 and today,
27 years later,

51
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:59,890
unemployment surpasses 20% one in every 
three citizens' lives in poverty.

52
00:02:59,891 --> 00:03:03,730
Public debt has multiplied by four in 
the last decade alone,

53
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,000
infrastructure is falling apart,
and on top of all of that,

54
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:11,680
they have a serious emigration.
Yes,

55
00:03:11,681 --> 00:03:12,640
you heard that,
right?

56
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:15,670
Emigration,
you see,

57
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:19,420
it's estimated that there are about 12 
million Armenians around the world,

58
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,900
but only 3 million of them actually live
in Armenia.

59
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,763
Therefore,
we're talking about one of the largest 

60
00:03:25,331 --> 00:03:30,331
diasporas in the entire world and only 
one out of every five Armenians lives in

61
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:35,270
Armenia itself,
not,

62
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,810
it wasn't astonishing enough.
Every year on average,

63
00:03:37,811 --> 00:03:42,811
40,000 Armenians leave the country and 
in many cases they simply never return.

64
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,773
Worst of all,
things do not seem to be improving jack 

65
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,190
out,
for example,

66
00:03:47,210 --> 00:03:50,740
the evolution of foreign investments in 
recent years,

67
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:00,340
but at this point you might be 
wondering,

68
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:03,820
well,
why are things going quite so badly?

69
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,683
Well,
div you at one of the reasons is 

70
00:04:05,681 --> 00:04:09,850
certainly corruption ends.
The huge amounts of power that oligarchs

71
00:04:09,851 --> 00:04:14,070
in the country possess.
You See,

72
00:04:14,071 --> 00:04:17,460
in the last 20 years,
the Republican Armenian party,

73
00:04:17,461 --> 00:04:19,860
Hey,
theoretically sends a rise in pro market

74
00:04:19,861 --> 00:04:20,694
party.
That's really just a huge club of 

75
00:04:21,781 --> 00:04:22,614
oligarchs,
has tons of the country's politics into 

76
00:04:24,301 --> 00:04:29,301
a network of interests and privileges.
Let's put it another way.

77
00:04:32,231 --> 00:04:33,064
For two entire decades,
if you wanted to do business in Armenia 

78
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:36,993
joining this party,
it was almost a mandatory step and if 

79
00:04:39,641 --> 00:04:42,790
you were a foreign up dropping by wasn't
a bad idea or either.

80
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,290
However,
just hold on a moment here,

81
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:47,800
because in April of 2018 Armenian says,
well,

82
00:04:47,830 --> 00:04:50,140
enough is enough.
And do you know what they did?

83
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,990
Well,
they held a revolution in the streets.

84
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:53,853
Check this out.

85
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,263
The revolution.

86
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:05,873
10 disastrous.
He has empowered after exhausting his 

87
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:10,350
maximum number of mandates,
president's seg socks,

88
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:14,190
young tried to copy Putin's strategy and
get elected as prime minister

89
00:05:19,730 --> 00:05:20,563
to do this.
He proposed a reform that basically 

90
00:05:21,891 --> 00:05:24,830
pasta president's main powers onto the 
prime minister.

91
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,693
Say,
what do you think it happens at this 

92
00:05:26,121 --> 00:05:26,954
point?
It's all we talking about a smart 

93
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:31,850
maneuver to stay in power or rape.
Leighton's mockery to all Armenians.

94
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,850
Well,
the have you,

95
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:33,800
uh,
it was very,

96
00:05:33,801 --> 00:05:35,570
very clear to the people of this 
country.

97
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,580
The presidents,
he was laughing at them.

98
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:38,563
He could rig the elections,
uses power at will and that's big 

99
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:43,340
oligarchs use the government to get 
rich.

100
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:44,174
But this,
this was too much off to 10 years of 

101
00:05:46,581 --> 00:05:47,540
presidents,
segs,

102
00:05:47,541 --> 00:05:48,374
terrible managements.
This was beyond the joke and the 

103
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:52,850
Armenians,
they did not accept it.

104
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:05,510
The 13th Nicole,
passion young,

105
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,353
a journalist and opposition deputy and 
the Armenian parliaments could lead a 

106
00:06:09,041 --> 00:06:10,420
protest mobilization.
Yeah,

107
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:13,340
Si.

108
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:15,770
But at the beginning,
very few people join this protest,

109
00:06:15,771 --> 00:06:18,060
but in a matter of days,
things changed.

110
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:18,923
A great deal.
On April the 16th for large groups of 

111
00:06:21,031 --> 00:06:24,240
students join the protest and four days 
later on Friday,

112
00:06:24,241 --> 00:06:27,540
April the 20th the movement had already 
concentrated and Yara van,

113
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:31,200
the country's capital with tens of 
thousands of people appearing.

114
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,683
Yeah.

115
00:06:34,150 --> 00:06:34,983
The government's,
which up until then had seen the 

116
00:06:36,281 --> 00:06:40,090
demonstrations is a small nuisance,
began to get rather nervous.

117
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,040
What do you think they did at this 
point?

118
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,120
Well,
they did what?

119
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:43,990
Tyron,
Steve,

120
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:47,470
they're rested the main leaders of these
completely peaceful demonstrations,

121
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:49,990
including their leader,
Nicholas Passion Yan,

122
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,913
they also announced that the police 
would disperse the protests rallies by 

123
00:06:53,141 --> 00:06:55,060
force and without any consideration.
Yeah.

124
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,840
At this point,
you might think that,

125
00:07:04,850 --> 00:07:06,290
well,
that was the end of the movement,

126
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,280
right?
Well,

127
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,091
in fact,
no,

128
00:07:08,091 --> 00:07:08,924
just the opposite happens.
It was the point of no return from that 

129
00:07:11,451 --> 00:07:14,120
moment.
More than 200,000 people in a country.

130
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:14,954
A few of them,
3 million inhabitants took to the 

131
00:07:16,401 --> 00:07:17,810
capitol streets,
the country.

132
00:07:17,811 --> 00:07:20,780
It was paralyzed work centers,
schools and universities.

133
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:21,673
They all closed.
The police faced with such a massive 

134
00:07:35,241 --> 00:07:36,620
concentration of people.
Well,

135
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:37,663
they decided to do absolutely nothing.
So all of this encouraged more and more 

136
00:07:40,581 --> 00:07:44,750
people to join in a completely peaceful 
and really quite happy protest.

137
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:47,600
Finally,
Armenia citizens had stood up and said,

138
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:50,420
enough's enough.
The velvet revolution is underway.

139
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:51,380
And what was the results?

140
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,330
Wow.

141
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:55,163
Pm on Monday,
April the 23rd just 10 days after the 

142
00:07:57,151 --> 00:08:00,090
protests began,
the president announced his resignation.

143
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:01,360
A few weeks later,
our passion,

144
00:08:01,361 --> 00:08:03,000
Yann himself,
the protests leader,

145
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,440
a journalist too.
In recent years,

146
00:08:04,441 --> 00:08:05,274
it's suffered an attempted attack and 
had been in prisons for confronting the 

147
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:10,050
governments had now been appointed prime
minister.

148
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:10,943
Yes.
It was a pretty crazy few weeks from 

149
00:08:12,690 --> 00:08:15,360
opponents of prisoner and from prison up
to the governments.

150
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,253
All in just a few days.
Thing is why does society stabs up to 

151
00:08:24,661 --> 00:08:26,010
demand freedom,
democracy,

152
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:28,110
and justice?
It's kind of hard to stop them.

153
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,053
I mean he now has a chance to change its
course and to face the oligarchs and 

154
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:35,310
ends the widespread corruption that's 
been consuming the country.

155
00:08:36,510 --> 00:08:36,720
We have

156
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:41,100
a new Armenia now where each investment 
will be protected and no investment will

157
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:43,590
be threatened any longer and he called 
Pacinian.

158
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:47,130
Tara for group is one of the largest 
companies in the sugar trade,

159
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:50,430
but this company is forbidden to import 
sugar to Armenia.

160
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:51,343
We can to allow them to do this as well 
as allow other companies and we will 

161
00:08:54,481 --> 00:08:56,160
definitely it.
There should be no

162
00:08:56,190 --> 00:08:58,800
monopolies in Armenia.
Nicole Pacinian,

163
00:08:58,830 --> 00:08:59,663
Armenian prime minister,
let's hold on for just a moment because 

164
00:09:02,191 --> 00:09:03,024
it's certainly not going to be easy for 
one because the Republican Party is 

165
00:09:05,971 --> 00:09:06,804
still controls congress and it's 
representative of several ready status 

166
00:09:09,301 --> 00:09:12,570
that they won't resign or make it easy 
for the new prime minister and that's an

167
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:15,870
old old as if that wasn't enough apart 
from their own internal problems.

168
00:09:15,871 --> 00:09:16,704
Armenia as two other important 
challenges and to one of them is 

169
00:09:19,951 --> 00:09:21,570
Vladimir Putin's,
Russia,

170
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:33,070
Russia and usury threats.
Moscow has such a huge amount of control

171
00:09:34,661 --> 00:09:37,120
over Armenia is economy,
defense and foreign policy.

172
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,223
Many analysts speak openly about the 
kind of defacto occupation without 

173
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:44,380
giving any further and the Armenian city
of [inaudible],

174
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,243
the Russian army has right next to the 
Turkish border and important military 

175
00:09:48,491 --> 00:09:49,324
base with more than 5,000 soldiers,
Mig 29 aircrafts as 300 anti aircraft 

176
00:09:54,011 --> 00:09:54,844
missile system.
Yeah,

177
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,010
but it isn't just a military issue to a 
large extent.

178
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,883
The country also depends on the 
remittances sentence cut by more than 2 

179
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,650
million Armenians who are currently 
living in Russia.

180
00:10:06,710 --> 00:10:09,560
I in addition,
the Russian giant is its main commercial

181
00:10:09,561 --> 00:10:12,350
partner and completely controls their 
energy supply.

182
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:13,490
I mean,
check this out.

183
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:16,730
What does crude in Armenia is something 
unnatural?

184
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:19,400
It is next to Iran,
a major exporter of gas,

185
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:20,323
but it imports it's gas from Siberia as 
a result of agreements that do little 

186
00:10:23,871 --> 00:10:26,540
more than legalize Armenia's occupation.
Indeed,

187
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,463
under the terms of those accords,
you're Yvonne can't make a deal with 

188
00:10:30,201 --> 00:10:32,250
Tehran and less Moscow.
Oh,

189
00:10:32,251 --> 00:10:34,280
agrees.
Ruben [inaudible],

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:38,930
the editor of the Russian service of the
one in.am Internet portal.

191
00:10:39,050 --> 00:10:39,883
The fact is that so far Vladimir Putin 
has had very good relations with the 

192
00:10:42,921 --> 00:10:46,040
government and do you all know that 
these kinds of revolutions,

193
00:10:46,041 --> 00:10:50,270
they don't exactly thrilled Pearson,
so there's a warning on the table here.

194
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:54,580
Do not pay too much attention to the 
seductive calls of the European Union of

195
00:10:54,581 --> 00:10:55,414
the United States.
Certainly the 5,000 Russian soldiers 

196
00:10:58,011 --> 00:11:02,990
stationed in Armenia certainly help put 
this message from Moscow across buts.

197
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:06,650
That is not all.
There is also another huge threat here.

198
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,593
Remember the republic of outs like that.
I mentioned her right at the beginning 

199
00:11:09,231 --> 00:11:10,064
of the video.
Well sorts of a protectorate of Armenia 

200
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:13,283
in such way this Azerbaijan and 
considers it to be an occupied 

201
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:18,560
territory.
Indeed,

202
00:11:18,561 --> 00:11:19,394
they've had no qualms about expressing 
their intention to reconquer it and 

203
00:11:22,411 --> 00:11:23,061
tear.
It must be said,

204
00:11:23,061 --> 00:11:23,894
the confrontations ons unusual.
Amazon even relatively recently in 2016 

205
00:11:27,921 --> 00:11:28,754
hard confrontations took place that four
days until Vladimir Putin demanded a 

206
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:33,373
ceasefire,

207
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,560
it will be asleep.
The risk exists,

208
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:41,170
especially because Azerbaijan has oil 
and gas that you,

209
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,203
that means money.
To give you an idea as a bit as John's 

210
00:11:44,041 --> 00:11:48,570
military budget is as big as the 
Armenian governments in higher budgets.

211
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:51,060
So if one day Russia decides to wash its
hands,

212
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,340
Armenia could certainly get into a lot 
of trouble.

213
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,233
Anyway.
That is how things stand in the country 

214
00:11:56,621 --> 00:11:57,940
today.
But now it's your turn.

215
00:11:57,941 --> 00:12:00,040
Have you even heard of the Republic of 
art sac?
