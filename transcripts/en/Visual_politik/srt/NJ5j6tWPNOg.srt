1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,100
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:11,390
it's hard to put a sign.
Two thoughts when thinking about Africa.

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,230
The first is the thing that Africa is a 
continent forever sentence do poverty,

4
00:00:15,231 --> 00:00:16,064
illness,
starvation and tragedy and the loss of 

5
00:00:18,141 --> 00:00:18,974
tragedy.
So the Africa is often thought of as a 

6
00:00:20,191 --> 00:00:24,490
somewhat compact territory web.
Everything is connected to westernize.

7
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:25,333
Africa can look more like a country than
a consonance with many feedings or 

8
00:00:28,241 --> 00:00:31,640
realize the colossal size on this 
continent.

9
00:00:31,700 --> 00:00:34,010
Africa is as big as Europe,
the US,

10
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:37,310
India,
China and Argentina combined.

11
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,710
So now you can imagine the deluge 
felicity,

12
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:44,690
that this huge territory must contain in
2010 if the economist referred to Africa

13
00:00:44,750 --> 00:00:48,470
as the consonants without hope buses as 
can often happen,

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:52,820
things rapidly changed in Africa since 
the start of the 21st century.

15
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,760
Africa that has experienced a 
significant boost,

16
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,623
especially in the poorest countries on 
the continent with the exception of 

17
00:00:59,481 --> 00:01:00,314
South Africa.
The countries of sub Saharan Africa 

18
00:01:02,091 --> 00:01:02,924
achieved annual growth rates of 6.2%
while comparison that is twice the 

19
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,024
growth rates of countries in Latin 
America during the same time period in 

20
00:01:11,361 --> 00:01:15,320
2015 five of the 10 economies that grew 
the most in the world.

21
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:18,140
Where in Africa,
these are the Ivory Coast,

22
00:01:18,590 --> 00:01:20,420
Ethiopia,
Tanzania,

23
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:23,840
Rwanda,
and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

24
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,440
The growth rate of these countries 
exceeded 7%

25
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:28,343
Democratic Republic of Congo is been 
ranked among the top 10 countries for 

26
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:33,300
reforms in the world.
For example,

27
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,420
in 2014 there are already nearly 7,000
enterprises that have been created.

28
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,280
Although the growth figures were a bit 
smaller,

29
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:41,114
the situation remains similar in the 
year 2016 all of this growth has led to 

30
00:01:44,781 --> 00:01:47,000
some really significant social 
consequences.

31
00:01:47,001 --> 00:01:47,834
So let's have a look at some of these.
Foreign life expectancy has increased 

32
00:01:50,841 --> 00:01:51,674
significantly over the last eight years 
and child mortality figures and those 

33
00:01:54,291 --> 00:01:57,440
dying from starvation has been cut in 
half.

34
00:01:57,470 --> 00:01:58,303
To sum up extreme poverty,
you still affect 58% of the population 

35
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:02,384
in 1990 900 now it is decreased to just 
35% it is still true that more than 420 

36
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:11,660
million people are still suffering from 
extreme poverty in Africa,

37
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:12,523
which is tragic.
There's fortunately the future is 

38
00:02:14,661 --> 00:02:15,860
looking brighter than ever.
Right?

39
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:16,723
Another thing is also certain Africa is 
going to have a major global role over 

40
00:02:20,751 --> 00:02:25,751
the coming decades and it's middleclass 
or consumer class is the fastest growing

41
00:02:25,941 --> 00:02:26,774
in the world.
The fact is Africa is no longer an 

42
00:02:29,751 --> 00:02:32,330
emerging.
It is here now.

43
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,283
Africa is being urbanized quickly which 
allows for both the provision of public 

44
00:02:36,201 --> 00:02:39,590
services and also economies of scale.
In the near future.

45
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,580
We are going to find as many of the 
world's biggest cities are on this call.

46
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,663
Smith

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:48,593
who knows Lagos,
Nairobi or accurate money to become the 

48
00:02:50,511 --> 00:02:52,880
new Shanghai in just a few short 
decades.

49
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:53,743
For example,
the tallest skyscraper in Africa for 

50
00:02:55,551 --> 00:02:58,430
Haas Tower is currently being built in 
Nairobi in Acra,

51
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,264
the capitalist of Ghana.
Six malls have been built in only six 

52
00:03:02,051 --> 00:03:02,884
years and while that might not seem like
a lot when you consider that there was 

53
00:03:05,621 --> 00:03:09,520
only one mall in the entire city before 
those six new ones were built,

54
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,354
it seems like a little bit more foreign 
investments has also grown strongly in 

55
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:16,420
the last few years and it's half of 
these investments operating areas they'd

56
00:03:16,421 --> 00:03:19,060
have nothing to do with Africa's natural
resources.

57
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:19,923
This is important because many of the 
countries in Africa are trying to 

58
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:24,310
develop industries outside of raw 
materials,

59
00:03:24,311 --> 00:03:27,100
so they are depending less on these 
natural resources.

60
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:30,370
These economies are known as the African
lions,

61
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:37,960
the African lions.
These African lions include Kenya,

62
00:03:37,961 --> 00:03:39,330
Uganda,
Tanzania,

63
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:41,020
Mozambique and Zambia.

64
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,140
These other countries in Africa that are
developing the fastest.

65
00:03:44,170 --> 00:03:47,230
Now we're going to discuss each of them 
in detail in upcoming videos,

66
00:03:47,231 --> 00:03:49,990
but today we're just going to focus on 
three of them.

67
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:51,013
Russel Rwanda,
this is a small country with a 

68
00:03:54,431 --> 00:03:57,970
population of only 12 million people and
it doesn't have any coastline.

69
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:58,833
It is still a poor country but it is 
registered and almost 9% annual growth 

70
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:03,033
since the year 2001 and importantly this
country has no oil or other important 

71
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,150
natural resources.
So the big question is,

72
00:04:10,151 --> 00:04:13,120
well how did they do it?
This has actually been mostly down.

73
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,020
So you supporting business creation.
This is why Rwanda is the second easiest

74
00:04:17,021 --> 00:04:17,854
country to do business in in sub Saharan
Africa according to the world's bank 

75
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:21,693
doing business report.
So the question you might be asking is 

76
00:04:23,651 --> 00:04:25,960
this is a coincidence and we have visual
politic,

77
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,250
we really don't think so.

78
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,600
We are know what example looking at 
under the 50th their 50th if we got word

79
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:32,443
organized,
if we other way with it and you put 

80
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:36,100
everything that's needed and to the 
world are connected.

81
00:04:36,430 --> 00:04:39,310
The portable growth.
Now thanks to all of this,

82
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,173
nearly all children have primary 
education and as a 98% of its people 

83
00:04:43,391 --> 00:04:45,880
already have access to health care.
As a consequence,

84
00:04:45,881 --> 00:04:46,714
child mortality has been reduced by 60% 
had to aids and malaria have also seen 

85
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,590
significant reductions.
Further Rwanda,

86
00:04:53,591 --> 00:04:54,424
President Paul Kagame,
he claims to be a disciple of Lee Kuan 

87
00:04:57,310 --> 00:04:58,990
Yew,
the legendary leader of Singapore.

88
00:04:58,991 --> 00:05:01,060
Here we're going to be discussing in an 
upcoming episode,

89
00:05:01,061 --> 00:05:02,920
so don't forget to subscribe if you 
haven't already,

90
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:03,754
so you will get notified of our bats.
And also Wayne miss out on any of our 

91
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:08,810
other videos,
if you up yet

92
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:12,123
is a much larger country with a 
population of nearly 100 million people 

93
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,383
in Ethiopia.
Around 20 million people still have 

94
00:05:18,731 --> 00:05:21,190
nutritional problems and that is not the
only problem they have.

95
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,710
The government's also become more 
authoritarian recently.

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:25,510
However,
things aren't changing fast.

97
00:05:25,511 --> 00:05:26,344
And today,
Ethiopia's Capitol Adis Abba is always 

98
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,970
pursuing significant construction 
projects.

99
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,580
In fact,
about a year ago at us,

100
00:05:32,581 --> 00:05:33,414
out of the bar opens the first modern 
tram system in all of sub Saharan 

101
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,031
Africa.
And to be honest,

102
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,864
they deserve it.
Ethiopia is a country which has grown 

103
00:05:39,671 --> 00:05:40,504
significantly in the last 10 years.
It's economy as multiplied by a factor 

104
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:48,040
of five in this period and it's GDP has 
grown by over 10% every year.

105
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:48,923
Yeah.

106
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,640
Now you might be asking,
well,

107
00:05:55,670 --> 00:05:56,930
how did they do it?
Well,

108
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:57,793
they were simply trying to be more 
attractive to investors and then 

109
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,700
neighboring countries.
In doing so,

110
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:04,550
the country has established at two main 
priorities.

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,230
One achieved stable macro economics and 
to establish attractive taxation,

112
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:11,450
for example,
and in boards of technological equipment

113
00:06:11,451 --> 00:06:12,284
such as machinery,
does not have any important charge that 

114
00:06:14,681 --> 00:06:17,450
other companies don't have to pay any 
tax in their first five years,

115
00:06:17,451 --> 00:06:18,930
which is pretty cool.
Nice.

116
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:26,750
We couldn't do this video without 
mentioning Botswana,

117
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:27,613
the country which recently celebrated in
2016 at the 50th anniversary of its 

118
00:06:31,311 --> 00:06:32,144
independence.
What's one APP has been the greatest 

119
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:36,890
economic success story in all of Africa?
In fact,

120
00:06:36,891 --> 00:06:37,724
it is even one of the most successful 
worldwide at the time of Botswana's 

121
00:06:40,671 --> 00:06:41,504
independence in the year 1966 it was one
of the poorest countries on the planet 

122
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:46,513
on top of that,
and so the country has suffered severe 

123
00:06:47,571 --> 00:06:48,404
droughts and does suffered from the 
second largest aids epidemic in the 

124
00:06:51,081 --> 00:06:53,510
world.
In spite of all these obstacles,

125
00:06:53,511 --> 00:06:55,320
the country,
it has experienced developments,

126
00:06:55,321 --> 00:06:56,154
so significance,
but it's GDP in purchasing power parity 

127
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:01,280
is equivalent to two countries such as 
Columbia,

128
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,840
Brazil,
or Thailand's.

129
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,703
This is obviously considering the 
different levels of prices among these 

130
00:07:05,841 --> 00:07:06,560
countries.

131
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,393
Si.

132
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:12,723
Yeah,
the key to success and can be found in 

133
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:15,094
the strength of its national 
institutions that healthy public 

134
00:07:17,621 --> 00:07:21,010
finances and above all the country's 
legal certainty.

135
00:07:21,070 --> 00:07:21,903
In fact,
in the last CPI corruption perception 

136
00:07:23,501 --> 00:07:26,290
index,
Botswana was ranked in 31st position.

137
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,660
This is a better position than countries
like Spain,

138
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,040
Israel,
or Taiwan,

139
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:30,903
rule of law,

140
00:07:31,950 --> 00:07:34,800
regulatory reform,
good governance,

141
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:38,580
all those things matter even more 
because people should be able to start a

142
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:39,414
business and ship their goods without 
having to pay a bribe or hire somebody 

143
00:07:41,951 --> 00:07:42,770
whose cousin.

144
00:07:42,770 --> 00:07:43,603
But now,
how about some more surprising facts 

145
00:07:45,111 --> 00:07:45,944
about Africa?
You should know that this continent is 

146
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:48,524
already home.
It's a 400 companies with a turnover of 

147
00:07:51,111 --> 00:07:51,944
more than a billion dollars a year.
So it really does seem that the ends of 

148
00:07:54,891 --> 00:07:58,410
Africa being a totally poor consonant is
coming to an end.

149
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,333
Furthermore in Africa we can also find 
Nollywood is the second largest film 

150
00:08:02,121 --> 00:08:04,610
industry in terms of films produced in 
the world.

151
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:07,220
Only 2,500
films less than Bollywood.

152
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,083
Further in Nigeria alone,
the film industry employees around a 

153
00:08:10,791 --> 00:08:15,791
million workers.
Now for just one final surprise,

154
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:23,000
Africa is the wells leader in online 
banking and mobile phone payments.

155
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:24,710
Yes,
you probably weren't expecting that,

156
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:25,603
but it is absolutely true today many 
farmers share information through SMS 

157
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:32,510
and in the string silvery ones it is 
popular to use safe motos,

158
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:36,170
which is like a Rwandan version of Uber,
except there's a small difference.

159
00:08:36,170 --> 00:08:37,003
Instead of using cars,
they use motorcycles because there are 

160
00:08:38,971 --> 00:08:39,804
very few cars available.
So the thing about Africa is that it is 

161
00:08:42,051 --> 00:08:42,884
changing incredibly fast,
but the truth is that there are still 

162
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:49,280
many challenges and difficulties that 
the continent is going to face.

163
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:50,330
A hat,
for example,

164
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:51,193
consolidating the rule of law,
reducing poverty and improving their 

165
00:08:53,571 --> 00:08:56,130
infrastructure.
And of course they supports in ends once

166
00:08:56,131 --> 00:09:00,000
and for all to all those terrible 
dictatorships in countries like Angola,

167
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,490
Eritrea or Equatorial Guinea.
However,

168
00:09:02,491 --> 00:09:06,840
everything does seem to indicate that 
the future of Africa is brighter than it

169
00:09:06,841 --> 00:09:07,674
has ever been.
So I hope you found that video

Do you think that Africa is going to 

172
00:09:12,481 --> 00:09:14,490
become a major player in the coming 
decades?
