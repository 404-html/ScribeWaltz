1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:00,863
One thing is very clear,
Vladimir Putin is one of the most 

2
00:00:03,001 --> 00:00:03,834
controversial politicians in the world.
He is vitalized by some and hated by 

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:09,144
others,
but what is for sure is that Putin's 

4
00:00:10,411 --> 00:00:13,920
period in office is making its mark on 
international politics.

5
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,280
The truth is that the government has 
achieved little in terms of economic and

6
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,114
social matters under his leadership.
His popularity among Russians remains 

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,660
really high today.
In this video,

8
00:00:24,661 --> 00:00:28,890
we're going to analyze why Putin is 
quite popular in Russia,

9
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,213
so this,
this Spanish saying that says after the 

10
00:00:38,961 --> 00:00:40,940
storm that comes the calm.
Well,

11
00:00:40,941 --> 00:00:44,300
when it comes to Russia,
this is exactly what happens after going

12
00:00:44,301 --> 00:00:45,134
through a tough crisis in the last few 
years due to the fall in oil prices as 

13
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:48,644
well as the sanctions received from the 
international community for occupying 

14
00:00:50,901 --> 00:00:53,990
Crimea.
The government has been pretty blunt,

15
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:55,820
but difficult times have passed.
Ams.

16
00:00:55,821 --> 00:00:59,690
The Russian economy is back,
but is it really,

17
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:02,000
I mean,
where's the evidence to really back this

18
00:01:02,001 --> 00:01:02,834
up and tell me,
what do you think Russian grief is 

19
00:01:04,431 --> 00:01:08,120
expected to be in 2017?
Twelve percent maybe nine,

20
00:01:08,150 --> 00:01:09,130
five,
three,

21
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:10,400
two?
Nope.

22
00:01:10,430 --> 00:01:11,263
Well,
it's actually predicted to be one 

23
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,150
percent

24
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:16,000
month after month.
The Russian economy keeps growing.

25
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:16,893
For 2017,
we're expecting a growth of one percent 

26
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:21,040
or even more Igor Shuvalov

27
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:21,963
that sure doesn't look like a lot and 
that's bearing in mind that Russia is 

28
00:01:25,271 --> 00:01:27,550
not exactly a rich country to begin 
with,

29
00:01:27,551 --> 00:01:28,384
and to be honest,
that one percent is only if we believe 

30
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:32,290
the statistics of the Russian 
government's,

31
00:01:32,291 --> 00:01:33,124
which well,
more and more analysts considered to be 

32
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:37,750
rather fictitious.
The truth is that even though everything

33
00:01:37,751 --> 00:01:38,584
seems to indicate that the Russian 
economy is more stable for last few 

34
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:42,303
years,
have not exactly been easy for the 

35
00:01:43,601 --> 00:01:46,210
Russians.
According to the Russian social security

36
00:01:46,211 --> 00:01:47,044
institutes in the year 2016 alone,
Russian citizens suffered from the 

37
00:01:50,261 --> 00:01:51,094
biggest loss in purchasing power.
That means real income since the 19 

38
00:01:54,341 --> 00:01:56,100
nineties.
Not a good

39
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,043
thing.
The crisis and the depreciation of the 

40
00:01:58,851 --> 00:01:59,684
ruble,
the Russian currency has led to this 

41
00:02:01,761 --> 00:02:02,594
country with $145 million inhabitants,
tabet GDP that's similar to that of 

42
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:07,244
Australia,
which only has a population of $23 

43
00:02:09,481 --> 00:02:09,960
million.

44
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:13,770
And what's even worse is that for now it
doesn't look like the situation is going

45
00:02:13,771 --> 00:02:14,604
to improve.
So here we come to the great Russian 

46
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:17,733
anomaly evidence,
which shows that this country is very 

47
00:02:20,311 --> 00:02:21,144
different from any other,
neither the crisis and all these 

48
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:24,083
terrible economic conditions have 
damaged the national popularity of 

49
00:02:26,731 --> 00:02:28,060
Vladimir Putin.
In fact,

50
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:31,860
Putin's popularity is today higher than 
it's pretty much ever been.

51
00:02:32,010 --> 00:02:33,780
According to polls from the Levada 
Center,

52
00:02:33,781 --> 00:02:37,920
Putin's approval rating among the 
Russian population is almost 80 percent.

53
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:39,160
I'll have a look at it.

54
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:39,993
This

55
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,803
now.
You might be wondering how is this even 

56
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:49,770
possible?
Why is this man immune to such a crisis?

57
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:50,663
Well,
let's have a look at just what is 

58
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:52,374
happening.

59
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,040
The protective father,
when the Russian

60
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,210
economy is pretty much mandatory to talk
about oil and raw materials,

61
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:05,133
and here are two pieces of information 
so you can get some idea of just how 

62
00:03:07,781 --> 00:03:10,720
dependent on Russia is on these 
resources

63
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,230
before the fall.
And the prices of crude oil,

64
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:16,530
oil and natural gas meant a lot to the 
Russian economy.

65
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:17,693
Seventy percent of the country's exports
and more than 50 percent of all income 

66
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:24,060
of the Russian government came from 
these two commodities.

67
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:29,380
And take a look at the evolution of the 
price of oil during the years.

68
00:03:29,381 --> 00:03:32,860
Peter has been in office.
So anyway.

69
00:03:32,861 --> 00:03:33,694
Well Putin,
he was incredibly lucky right after he 

70
00:03:35,831 --> 00:03:36,664
reached out the price of oil,
which should remained stable around $20 

71
00:03:39,101 --> 00:03:39,934
a barrel for the last 10 years,
started to increase quickly and of 

72
00:03:42,731 --> 00:03:43,564
course this is an amazing flow of money 
coming into the country just so you can 

73
00:03:46,631 --> 00:03:47,464
get an idea of how significant this was.
The share the government contributed to 

74
00:03:50,201 --> 00:03:54,520
the economy rose from 35 percent to 70 
percent.

75
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:57,610
All of a sudden prosperity came to the 
entire nation.

76
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:00,850
There were cranes everywhere.
Skyscrapers started to appear as if they

77
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,684
were mushrooms after the rain and the 
standard of living for Russians went up 

78
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,790
and up and up.
Yeah.

79
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:07,713
So it is true that Putin's 
authoritarianism could be felt right 

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,740
from the very beginning,
but I mean say what you ucas.

81
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:16,510
The money was flowing.
Okay,

82
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:17,403
so we could say that there was this sort
of agreements between Russian society 

83
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:25,210
leader in exchange for not asking you 
about civil liberties or corruption.

84
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,930
The government gave prosperity and 
stability to the citizens.

85
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,560
In a way Putin became some sort of 
protective father to the nation.

86
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,710
A tough,
capable father who was able to take care

87
00:04:35,711 --> 00:04:39,280
of his children has always.
The problem is that these situations are

88
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,114
fragile.
Know government's not even Putin's as 

89
00:04:42,101 --> 00:04:45,290
the capacity of achieving this 
prosperity all on its higher.

90
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,010
Yeah.

91
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:50,803
With such high oil prices,
Putin didn't conduct any reforms in 

92
00:04:53,421 --> 00:04:54,254
Russia.
I mean,

93
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,450
what would really be the point ends up 
because of that.

94
00:04:56,451 --> 00:05:00,030
When the price of oil starts to go down 
in the summer of 2014,

95
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:00,973
the economy of Russia followed the same 
pattern and it is here that we come to 

96
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:05,953
the most interesting part of this story.
None of these things affected Putin's 

97
00:05:09,291 --> 00:05:11,220
popularity.
The Russian president knew,

98
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:15,260
for want of a better word,
how to recycle his earliest strategy.

99
00:05:15,261 --> 00:05:17,690
If at the beginning he was the guardian 
of prosperity,

100
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:18,553
now he would become the leader who would
recover the previous great influenced 

101
00:05:21,191 --> 00:05:23,360
that mother Russia use to have

102
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,640
nationalist

103
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:28,563
fervor.
Sorry if Russia's economy wasn't having 

104
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:33,010
the best moments.
Well,

105
00:05:33,011 --> 00:05:36,420
he had to look for another source of 
popularity and Putin,

106
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:38,170
well,
he knew where to find it.

107
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,053
For 500 years.
Russia's foreign policy was all about 

108
00:05:41,740 --> 00:05:42,573
expanding its influenced since the times
of only when the terrible around the 

109
00:05:45,101 --> 00:05:48,400
14th century,
Russia expanded its territory on average

110
00:05:48,430 --> 00:05:49,263
80 square kilometers a day until it 
became by far the largest country on 

111
00:05:52,751 --> 00:05:55,060
earth dance well as the most powerful.
However,

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:55,953
after the fall of the Soviet Union,
the influence of Russia on the world 

113
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:03,760
collapse.
Puson made a new promise and it could be

114
00:06:07,851 --> 00:06:12,851
summarized like this,
be a prosperous country and the economic

115
00:06:22,271 --> 00:06:23,104
situation may be bad,
but I bladimir poutine will recover 

116
00:06:26,351 --> 00:06:30,070
Russia's influence in the world.
You may not be your wealthy people.

117
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:30,963
Bless you.
Our nation will be strong in order to 

118
00:06:37,151 --> 00:06:40,120
make this strategy work.
Some things on unnecessary.

119
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,120
The first of them is to praise 
nationalist sentiments,

120
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:44,950
and this means well.
Russia,

121
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:45,760
Russia,
and more.

122
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:46,420
Russia

123
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,420
bladimir unveiled a statue of medieval 
namesake who united Russian land.

124
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:54,540
Well,
either way following these same ideals,

125
00:06:54,541 --> 00:06:57,810
all the recurring adverts of new 
invincible weapons,

126
00:06:57,840 --> 00:06:58,673
incredibly powerful ones which will 
guarantee you Russia gains great status 

127
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:04,020
and global supremacy.
First of all,

128
00:07:04,021 --> 00:07:04,854
though,
an important question is going to be 

129
00:07:06,061 --> 00:07:09,540
whether the Russian governments can 
actually afford these weapons.

130
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:13,950
The second necessary thing is rather 
more sinister and that's going to be for

131
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,813
Russia to find an enemy.
This enemy is something that can push 

132
00:07:17,611 --> 00:07:21,570
Russians towards a common goal.
Let me explain that a little further.

133
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,330
Russia,
they need a threats.

134
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:24,183
They need an aggressive.
They need something for the Russians to 

135
00:07:26,281 --> 00:07:27,114
unite against,
and in order to achieve that content 

136
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:32,050
requires an aggressive foreign policy.

137
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:32,903
I see

138
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,633
the Ukrainian crisis,
the accusations against NATO and the 

139
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:38,604
occupation of Crimea.
All examples that have made Putin's 

140
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:44,010
popularity rise again in the alleys.
If the Russians,

141
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:46,960
Putin is taking Russia back to its 
previous grants.

142
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,523
Yes,

143
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:52,813
second strategy,
you can explain the busy schedule of 

144
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:56,860
rough and diplomacy.
In the last few years,

145
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:00,040
they may not have much money that Moscow
is everywhere,

146
00:08:00,041 --> 00:08:02,050
Ukraine,
Syria and North Africa,

147
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:03,430
and hey,
to be honest,

148
00:08:03,431 --> 00:08:04,264
the sanctions the international 
community have imposed on Russia had 

149
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:09,370
kind of the opposite effect that was 
intended.

150
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,263
They have been seen by the Russians as 
humiliating and if they've had any 

151
00:08:13,031 --> 00:08:13,864
effects,
he was to consolidate popular support 

152
00:08:15,311 --> 00:08:17,740
for Vladimir Putin.
Seventy five,

153
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:18,593
four percent of Russians consider the 
sanctions to be an intention to weaken 

154
00:08:22,351 --> 00:08:24,930
and humiliate Russia.
Only five percent.

155
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,500
Think of them as an instrument to stop 
the conflict in Ukraine,

156
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,423
Levada center

157
00:08:29,590 --> 00:08:33,200
and last of all for Putin.
It is unnecessary for him to consolidate

158
00:08:33,201 --> 00:08:35,680
to the image of a strong determined 
leader,

159
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:39,430
almost a national hero something of a 
savior,

160
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:40,353
if you will.
There is no Russia today if there is no 

161
00:08:42,881 --> 00:08:43,960
Putin,
sorry.

162
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:44,823
These are the keys and understanding why
Vladimir Putin has been able to keep an 

163
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,693
even increases popularity.
He is no longer the guardian of 

164
00:08:51,251 --> 00:08:54,670
prosperity,
but the leader who will regain the power

165
00:08:54,671 --> 00:08:59,671
that Russia ones had crony capitalism.

166
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:03,023
Another decisiveness at Sydney 
considered is that Putin's governments 

167
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,113
also survivors because he has been able 
to create a network of powerful 

168
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:09,983
oligarchs around him who have gotten 
rich thanks to the resources of the 

169
00:09:12,451 --> 00:09:13,284
Russian state governments aids launch 
state contracts and things in its 

170
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:18,670
commitments to replace imports have all 
benefited.

171
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:19,523
These oligarchs,
former judo partner awarded contract to 

172
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:28,041
build Russian bridge to Crimea.
It'll cost more than $3,000,000,000

173
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:32,100
besides speak to it as a backup plan.
In case things go awry,

174
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,630
he can privatized or more accurately 
just give states companies away to these

175
00:09:36,631 --> 00:09:40,890
oligarchs who will use that power and 
money to further Putin's interests.

176
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,753
The Russian president has made it clear 
that nobody strategic investors will be 

177
00:09:45,151 --> 00:09:47,460
allowed to participate in 
privatizations,

178
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:48,343
and that means only investors who have 
been selected by the Russian 

179
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:55,930
government's iron fist.
Oh,

180
00:09:56,310 --> 00:09:58,950
Ron's.
Lest we forget the repression,

181
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,380
political repression and the repression 
of minorities.

182
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,010
That seems to be kind of a fetish for 
dictators and potential dictators.

183
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,990
I mean,
just take a look at the last report from

184
00:10:06,991 --> 00:10:09,690
Amnesty International on human rights in
Russia.

185
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:10,943
It's pretty sad.
Restrictions on right to freedom of 

186
00:10:14,401 --> 00:10:15,234
expression,
association and Peaceful Assembly 

187
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,160
increased in 2016.
Well,

188
00:10:20,161 --> 00:10:23,790
now we all know the ingredients that 
explains Putin's popularity,

189
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,520
nationalism,
oligarchs,

190
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:28,080
censorship,
and political repression.

191
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:28,973
Putin has promised the people that they 
will become powerful again in exchange 

192
00:10:32,221 --> 00:10:34,530
for that unconditional loyalty.
However,

193
00:10:34,531 --> 00:10:35,364
despite all of this posturing,
it does seem kind of unlikely that 

194
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:38,724
Russia is going to be able to seriously 
competes with either China or the US in 

195
00:10:42,271 --> 00:10:44,780
the media and in the long run,
but that's our opinion here,

196
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:46,290
visual politic,
and as always,

197
00:10:46,291 --> 00:10:49,410
we'd love to know what you think.
Do you think Putin will be successful in

198
00:10:49,411 --> 00:10:52,450
giving Russia rids old power back?
What would you prefer?

199
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,570
National Power Bowl,
maybe wellbeing,

200
00:10:54,571 --> 00:10:55,740
prosperity,
and freedom.

201
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:56,663
We definitely know what weird ones,
but we'd like to know what you would 

202
00:10:58,831 --> 00:11:00,840
like.
