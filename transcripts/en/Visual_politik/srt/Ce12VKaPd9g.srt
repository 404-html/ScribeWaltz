1
00:00:09,190 --> 00:00:10,600
In teenagers,
either historical,

2
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:13,570
median cartel data,
Pablo Escobar has an idea,

3
00:00:13,600 --> 00:00:15,820
basically he had a vision,
suddenly have a dream,

4
00:00:15,821 --> 00:00:18,470
and that was to turn Columbia into a 
narco state,

5
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:19,343
the country where the governments and 
all public institutions would be 

6
00:00:22,061 --> 00:00:25,270
directly controlled by drug trafficking.
Such was his commitment.

7
00:00:25,271 --> 00:00:28,270
That's in 1982 as I think you probably 
know,

8
00:00:28,271 --> 00:00:29,104
Pablo Escobar himself,
one of the most important mobsters in 

9
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:32,793
all of history,
gained a seat at the Columbian Chamber 

10
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,810
of Representatives and it's important to
bear in mind that it's one thing for the

11
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:41,644
mafia to buy or bribe a politician and 
quite another for them to hold all the 

12
00:00:45,461 --> 00:00:46,294
power directly.
Can you imagine a country where the 

13
00:00:48,251 --> 00:00:49,270
police,
the army,

14
00:00:49,271 --> 00:00:52,750
all administrative officials,
and even the courts themselves as well,

15
00:00:52,751 --> 00:00:55,900
timidly under the direct orders of drug 
dealers.

16
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,793
Of course,
if Pablo Escobar's vision had panned 

17
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:58,894
out,
Columbia wouldn't certainly have much 

18
00:00:59,921 --> 00:01:01,990
higher levels of drug production and 
exports,

19
00:01:01,991 --> 00:01:05,110
but the median cartel itself would 
become untouchable.

20
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,003
Invincible.
He would've gained complete impunity to 

21
00:01:08,081 --> 00:01:10,990
do and undo whatever he wanted at.
Well,

22
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:13,900
fortunately Pablo Escobar never managed 
to carry out his dream.

23
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:14,890
However,
today,

24
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:15,723
three decades later,
it looks like his dream is now being 

25
00:01:18,041 --> 00:01:18,874
realized,
but this time we're not talking about 

26
00:01:20,471 --> 00:01:22,930
Columbia.
We're talking about Venezuela,

27
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:28,220
Columbia dictum,
wounded,

28
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:35,800
seeing grapples,
Columbiana,

29
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:38,900
Archean minutes with dealer.
Yeah,

30
00:01:39,110 --> 00:01:42,940
Cmo that apparently the four characters 
you're looking at right now,

31
00:01:42,941 --> 00:01:43,774
don't only control the country,
they are also the leaders of an 

32
00:01:45,881 --> 00:01:48,910
international crime and drug trafficking
network.

33
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:50,890
Of course,
we're talking about Nicolas Maduro,

34
00:01:50,891 --> 00:01:53,440
the president of Venezuela,
dios data Qbo,

35
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:57,850
the powerful presidents of the National 
Constituent Assembly who already rank as

36
00:01:57,851 --> 00:02:00,190
the strongest man in the regime,
and Tarek,

37
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,113
El Assami format,
vice presidents and current Minister of 

38
00:02:03,311 --> 00:02:04,144
Industry and national production whose 
personal fortune according to dea 

39
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,600
calculations,
surpasses the $3,000,000,000 mark.

40
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,750
And the fourth is Nestor Rivera,
Minister of internal affairs,

41
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:15,640
justice and peace.
Who could top it all off.

42
00:02:15,641 --> 00:02:18,730
Was the previous national accounts,
an architect's office director.

43
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,623
Well,
everything indicates that these four 

44
00:02:20,681 --> 00:02:24,610
people are leading the transformation of
Venezuela into a narco state.

45
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:29,670
Listen Up.
Mafia takes control.

46
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:37,530
Venezuela is in shreds.
Hunger is increasing,

47
00:02:37,531 --> 00:02:38,364
inflation is out of control,
and hundreds of thousands of people are 

48
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:43,740
fleeing the country.
Even hospitals don't have basic supplies

49
00:02:43,741 --> 00:02:45,480
like medicine,
analytical equipment,

50
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,463
or pastors.
There's such a huge mess that the vsa 

51
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:49,433
itself,
the Venezuelan state owned oil company 

52
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:53,310
with the most reserves in the world is 
bankrupt.

53
00:02:56,750 --> 00:02:57,070
Consider

54
00:02:57,070 --> 00:03:00,460
this to this day,
Pdvsa has many embargoed waters.

55
00:03:00,461 --> 00:03:03,670
There's in order to sell the 
increasingly dwindling Venezuelan oil,

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:04,533
it's beginning to resort to do tricks 
and techniques used by Hollywood movie 

57
00:03:07,331 --> 00:03:10,360
style smugglers.
For example,

58
00:03:10,361 --> 00:03:11,194
since Venezuelan oil companies are at 
risk of being confiscated to settle all 

59
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:15,274
outstanding debts on the oil,
they transport pdvsa has begun to 

60
00:03:18,161 --> 00:03:18,994
transfer oil from its ships,
do other ships with the Cuban flag out 

61
00:03:22,091 --> 00:03:22,924
at sea.
These ships are then responsible for 

62
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:29,071
taking the crude oil to its destination,
thus avoiding being seized because folks

63
00:03:29,891 --> 00:03:30,724
in Venezuela,
practically everything that has value 

64
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,693
has been or is being looted.
Corruption has reached almost every 

65
00:03:37,330 --> 00:03:38,163
corner of the country,
so the Bolivarian Revolution promised 

66
00:03:40,391 --> 00:03:41,224
prosperity.
What they forgot to clarify is that all 

67
00:03:43,061 --> 00:03:46,420
that prosperity would only be for a few 
for the friends of the revolution.

68
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:47,890
Of course.
Don't believe me?

69
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:49,780
Well,
take a look at this.

70
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,233
Many regime members promote and lead 
operations for gas contraband to 

71
00:03:55,150 --> 00:03:55,983
southern Brazil and Colombia.
They are also mostly responsible for 

72
00:03:58,510 --> 00:03:59,343
food and medicine contrabands,
which the state buys and then sells on 

73
00:04:01,571 --> 00:04:02,404
the black market.
They have looted public accounts and 

74
00:04:04,121 --> 00:04:07,450
tens of billions of dollars have 
disappeared from the government and from

75
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:12,451
the PDVSA in Venezuela.
Even the central banks,

76
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:14,520
US dollars have been looted.
Yeah,

77
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:15,880
you really did hear that,
right?

78
00:04:15,980 --> 00:04:16,813
That allow me to explain this.
One of the first things that the Chavez 

79
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,850
regime did was implement a rigid 
exchange control.

80
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:23,020
They fixed,
for example,

81
00:04:23,021 --> 00:04:23,854
the official exchange between the 
boulevard and the US dollar to a rate 

82
00:04:26,651 --> 00:04:29,230
that had nothing to do with the numbers 
on the street.

83
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:33,400
That way the government's friends could 
access US dollars with just a handful of

84
00:04:33,401 --> 00:04:34,234
Bolivares bolivares.
That gives it the country's current 

85
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:38,980
hyper inflation knob.
Now with practically nothing,

86
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,273
the minivan was so well perfected that 
it is estimated that 20 percent of all 

87
00:04:44,291 --> 00:04:45,124
imports declared in recent years have 
been completely false operations that 

88
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:48,904
were done for the sole purpose of 
obtaining dollars at the official 

89
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,670
exchange rate and then to save them in 
foreign accounts.

90
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:56,980
And this is important because according 
to estimates,

91
00:04:56,981 --> 00:04:57,814
we could be talking about a theft of 
more than a hundred billion dollars and 

92
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:06,700
of course be Dvsa,
hasn't escaped this plunder.

93
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,790
A group of companies lent seven point 2 
billion boulevard to PD vsa,

94
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,770
which when exchange at the black market 
rate would be about $42,

95
00:05:16,771 --> 00:05:17,604
million dollars,
but when exchange at the official rate 

96
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,373
would become approximately $600,
million dollars which were deposited in 

97
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:27,340
an account in Malta,
CSR but t's Venezuelan journalists,

98
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:28,203
but of course sins,
no more can be squeezed out of the 

99
00:05:29,651 --> 00:05:30,484
country.
The regime Johnson sought a new 

100
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,220
alternative source of income.

101
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:35,250
Put up your faith,
put up your faith.

102
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:41,820
I said,
no,

103
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,690
no,
no,

104
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:52,520
no,
no.

105
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:00,543
Well,
they look

106
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,383
it for you.

107
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:12,600
So no,

108
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:20,000
turning into a narco state

109
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:25,490
of drug dealers in Venezuela isn't new 
med.

110
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:28,520
Has however evolved and I want to 
explain for years,

111
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:29,354
Colombian cartels trying to use routes 
through Venezuela to distribute that 

112
00:06:32,631 --> 00:06:34,430
product.
Then of course to do so,

113
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:36,050
they began bing,
policemen,

114
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:38,120
national guard members,
high officials,

115
00:06:38,121 --> 00:06:38,954
et Cetera.
These people would then turn a blind 

116
00:06:40,791 --> 00:06:43,930
eye.
This was the first stage as it works.

117
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:47,840
Dealer's got to know the land batter and
figured out who they could trust and who

118
00:06:47,841 --> 00:06:48,674
they couldn't,
so they moved into the second stage of 

119
00:06:50,661 --> 00:06:51,770
things,
which was something like,

120
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,270
all right,
now that we have a deal,

121
00:06:53,271 --> 00:06:56,330
I'll give you some more money,
but you don't only look away.

122
00:06:56,331 --> 00:06:59,930
You've also got to protect me and 
transport my merchandise.

123
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:03,710
And this second stage was implemented 
later.

124
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,573
Many Colombian mobsters realized that 
given the enormous pressure that they 

125
00:07:07,071 --> 00:07:09,290
had from the Colombian government and 
the dea,

126
00:07:09,350 --> 00:07:12,980
that'd be safer in Venezuela.
So at the beginning of the 21st century,

127
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:13,843
that's precisely what happens.
Any of these sinister merchants moved 

128
00:07:16,481 --> 00:07:17,314
their operation centers from Columbia to
Venezuela and that's when they started 

129
00:07:21,151 --> 00:07:24,160
to closely collaborate with the 
authorities there.

130
00:07:24,190 --> 00:07:25,550
And I mean really

131
00:07:25,890 --> 00:07:26,723
sleep

132
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:28,933
say,
what do you think the Venezuelan 

133
00:07:29,331 --> 00:07:30,710
government did them?
Well,

134
00:07:30,711 --> 00:07:31,544
and then 2005,
they decided to expel the dea from 

135
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:35,174
Venezuela and territory and suspends 
their agreements to monitor knockout 

136
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,920
flights.
Therefore,

137
00:07:39,921 --> 00:07:40,754
Venezuelan and territory became a kind 
of refuge for drug trafficking in the 

138
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,800
United States.
Could no longer keep track of them.

139
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:47,450
They're pretty fantastic for them,
isn't it?

140
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,433
Of course,
in exchange for getting rid of the 

141
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:52,250
United States,
they have to pay a modest commission.

142
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,710
The regime johns,
they needed to live off something.

143
00:07:54,740 --> 00:07:55,550
Right?
Well,

144
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,320
that was the third stage.
Hold on.

145
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,154
One moment,
hit because that's how we got to the 

146
00:07:59,151 --> 00:08:01,940
fourth and last stage,
which is where we're at,

147
00:08:01,970 --> 00:08:05,960
right?
This was going well so well.

148
00:08:05,961 --> 00:08:06,794
In fact.
So there's plenty of the Bolivarian 

149
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:08,360
Revolution.
Really.

150
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:10,970
Leaders asked themselves a question.
We have the government,

151
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,140
the police,
the army,

152
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,033
and did a lot of resources.
Why on earth should we share anything 

153
00:08:15,381 --> 00:08:17,510
with the Colombians sold?
Whoever else?

154
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:21,710
Let's those couples that are

155
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:24,500
Columbiana.
Archean minutes.

156
00:08:24,501 --> 00:08:25,334
Wait,
sorry.

157
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,320
Do you know what happened then?
Well,

158
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:29,700
the Venezuelan authorities began 
arresting all of the drug traffickers,

159
00:08:29,701 --> 00:08:30,534
so you didn't want to cooperate with 
them by giving that route says well as 

160
00:08:33,291 --> 00:08:34,124
their distribution business to them.
That's how people such as Maximiliano 

161
00:08:38,210 --> 00:08:38,631
Bonnier,
AK,

162
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:42,020
if an NCR know the chief of the office,
Heck Taught Harnaman,

163
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:47,080
we Terago Aka Martin Yan Os Diego Perez,
Aka Diego restaurant,

164
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:50,450
and Daniel baret rubber re run naked.
All Loco fell.

165
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:53,810
All of them were found in the list of 
most significant traffic,

166
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,040
so everything

167
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:56,873
indicates that right now in Venezuela,
even though there are tons of criminal 

168
00:08:59,431 --> 00:09:00,264
groups operating in the area,
the government giants hold the ultimate 

169
00:09:03,331 --> 00:09:06,150
control and control to characters like 
del Dotto,

170
00:09:06,151 --> 00:09:09,720
Kobe allegedly the most important leader
of the cartel,

171
00:09:09,721 --> 00:09:12,810
the cartel formed by the leaders of the 
Bolivarian government's.

172
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:14,523
The Venezuelan people suffer under 
corrupt politicians who tighten their 

173
00:09:17,451 --> 00:09:20,180
grip overpower while lining their own 
pockets.

174
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,980
We are imposing costs on figures like 
Dios,

175
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:23,823
Datto Cabello,
who exploited their official positions 

176
00:09:26,001 --> 00:09:29,240
to engage in narcotics trafficking,
money laundering,

177
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,720
and Basil Mint of state funds and other 
corrupt activities.

178
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,090
US Treasury Secretary Steven mentioned

179
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:37,750
in fact one of his own personal 
assistance,

180
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:38,584
at least me Salazar,
fled Venezuela in 2014 with the help of 

181
00:09:41,551 --> 00:09:42,384
the dea and his statement couldn't be 
more forceful in addition to providing 

182
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,430
evidence on the organization's 
operation.

183
00:09:47,460 --> 00:09:48,293
He stated the mystic Dubay presidents of
the National Constituent Assembly gives 

184
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,344
direct orders on the rips and the 
departure of boats loaded with 

185
00:09:55,621 --> 00:09:58,320
prohibited substances,
and he's not the only one.

186
00:09:58,350 --> 00:10:01,530
Testimonies are accumulating in the 
officers of the DEA,

187
00:10:01,590 --> 00:10:03,840
for example.
Those will lead Mac lead statements from

188
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,260
when he was arrested in Columbia in 
2011.

189
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:11,580
Mccullough was one of the most powerful 
drug traffickers in Venezuela,

190
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:13,740
for example,
you controlled Puerto Cabezas,

191
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,633
which according to the dea was the exit 
point for most of the narcotics 

192
00:10:17,161 --> 00:10:19,560
distributed from the country.
Well,

193
00:10:19,561 --> 00:10:20,394
after his arrest,
he had declared with great detail that 

194
00:10:22,171 --> 00:10:25,110
he had done business with several dozens
of Venezuelan generals,

195
00:10:25,170 --> 00:10:28,070
high level government officials such as 
Henry Rangel Silva,

196
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:31,320
who was later named minister of Defense,
or Hugo Carvajal,

197
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:35,190
former army intelligence director who 
supposedly paid him $50,000 a week,

198
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:39,240
which is certainly a nice salary.
He also claims to a financed one of Hugo

199
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,410
Chavez campaigns in exchange for 
concessions in Puerto Conveyor.

200
00:10:44,790 --> 00:10:45,623
With all these relationships,
it's easy to understand how in November 

201
00:10:47,701 --> 00:10:48,534
2016,
a friend and tune your Campo Flores and 

202
00:10:50,641 --> 00:10:54,030
Francisco Flores to freight us to have 
the Venezuelan first ladies,

203
00:10:54,031 --> 00:10:54,864
nephews were convicted in a New York 
court conspiring to traffic hundreds of 

204
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,530
kilos of narcotics and folks,
according to current estimates,

205
00:11:01,531 --> 00:11:05,700
the business in Venezuela at wingstop 
growing between 15 and 20 percent of all

206
00:11:05,701 --> 00:11:09,240
the cocaine that moves in the world 
every year passes through this country.

207
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:11,730
And not only that,
as apparently the number of laboratories

208
00:11:11,731 --> 00:11:15,210
is also raising a great deal.
Of course,

209
00:11:15,211 --> 00:11:16,044
the giants of the Bolivarian Revolution.
The money to keep the structures of 

210
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,180
repression loyal,
the army,

211
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:24,210
the police,
the national guard or so in exchange for

212
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,073
working in Venezuela,
the different criminal groups based 

213
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:27,414
there from the mafia to the 
paramilitaries and the Colombian 

214
00:11:29,671 --> 00:11:33,720
gorillas support the regime and since 
there's good business,

215
00:11:33,721 --> 00:11:36,390
Maduro and company are still filling 
that pockets.

216
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:37,283
Unfortunately,
the consequences of all of this are 

217
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:43,881
terrible for one looting.
All public resources has led the country

218
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:47,790
to ruin ends.
On top of that,

219
00:11:47,791 --> 00:11:49,920
it's fueling an enormous amount of 
violence.

220
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:50,823
See,
according to data from the Venezuelan 

221
00:11:51,961 --> 00:11:54,220
violence observatory,
2017,

222
00:11:54,221 --> 00:11:55,054
there were 89 homicides per 100,000 
inhabitants in the country that is more 

223
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:02,250
than 26,000 people who lost their lives 
violently.

224
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:09,350
The

225
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:12,750
twitter has become the most dangerous 
country in all of Latin America.

226
00:12:12,751 --> 00:12:16,020
And the situation in some areas like 
Caracas is even worse.

227
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:16,883
The country's homicide rate skyrocketed 
in 2017 to 130 people 100,000 

228
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:22,950
inhabitants.
Meanwhile,

229
00:12:22,951 --> 00:12:23,784
members of the government,
I'll taking advantage of the situation 

230
00:12:25,650 --> 00:12:26,483
and developing fortunes which they're 
using to buy properties all over the 

231
00:12:29,191 --> 00:12:31,800
world from the Dominican Republic to 
Madrid.

232
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:32,723
Indeed Madrid is a city to which not 
only thousands of Venezuelans fleeing 

233
00:12:35,761 --> 00:12:36,594
the disaster are arriving,
but also many of the relatives of the 

234
00:12:38,801 --> 00:12:39,590
Solos,
cartel,

235
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:42,440
bosses and other high position members,
loyal to the revolution.

236
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:43,293
Going to now sometimes find myself 
sitting in restaurants in Madrid right 

237
00:12:47,461 --> 00:12:49,800
next to people who might.
I wouldn't feel comfortable,

238
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:54,630
ever seen CADAC Leopoldo Lopez Gill,
father of Leopoldo Lopez,

239
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:55,553
a leading opposition politician who has 
been kept under house arrest in Cadac 

240
00:12:59,401 --> 00:13:00,630
us.
Unfortunately,

241
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:04,860
the bolivarian regime has founded it's 
best ally in drug dealing though to fill

242
00:13:04,861 --> 00:13:07,390
their pockets and to keep that power in 
shorter viewer.

243
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,510
For now,
this is just how things are,

244
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,220
so I really hope you found this video
