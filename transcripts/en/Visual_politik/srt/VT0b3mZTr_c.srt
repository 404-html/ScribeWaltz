1
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:10,710
It is known as the Rainbow Nation for 
its cultural,

2
00:00:10,711 --> 00:00:11,544
linguistic and religious diversity.
Its Constitution alone acknowledges 11 

3
00:00:15,691 --> 00:00:16,680
different languages.

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,150
Yes,

5
00:00:19,150 --> 00:00:19,983
this is South Africa or a country 
situated in the extreme south of 

6
00:00:23,141 --> 00:00:23,580
average.

7
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,413
Gotcha.

8
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:26,663
It's not a small country.
It's surface area is laundry than 

9
00:00:28,561 --> 00:00:29,400
Germany,
France,

10
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:30,300
Italy,
Belgium,

11
00:00:30,301 --> 00:00:31,134
and the Netherlands combined.
It is by far the most developed economy 

12
00:00:34,351 --> 00:00:37,500
of all the countries situated south of 
the Sahara desert.

13
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,393
In the year 2010 it was the first 
African country to holds a soccer world 

14
00:00:42,091 --> 00:00:42,924
championship.
This was the summer of [inaudible] Waka 

15
00:00:45,090 --> 00:00:46,480
Waka,
anyone cast around then?

16
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:46,580
Yeah.

17
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:47,413
The box

18
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:55,340
pours in month in South Africa's history
was April,

19
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,680
1994 between the 26th and 29th of that 
month,

20
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:01,140
South Africa celebrated the first free 
universal ends,

21
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:04,160
democratic elections.
They were all seeing the longest because

22
00:01:04,161 --> 00:01:06,530
the election's lasted for four long 
days.

23
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,393
During that time,
South Africans left the house as 

24
00:01:08,901 --> 00:01:09,734
massively devote.
Having to wait in queues at kilometers 

25
00:01:11,991 --> 00:01:12,824
long

26
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:16,463
ahead

27
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:17,663
was justified for these elections.
Men to the ends of 300 years of 

28
00:01:20,791 --> 00:01:21,624
colonialism and white supremacy.
The elections mark to the end of 

29
00:01:24,481 --> 00:01:25,314
apartheid.

30
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,073
Apartheid

31
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,080
was this system based on racial 
segregation,

32
00:01:34,081 --> 00:01:34,914
which remains in effect for 50 years.
It mainly consisted of separating the 

33
00:01:38,281 --> 00:01:40,620
whites population from the black 
population.

34
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:42,960
This applies in any situation,
living,

35
00:01:42,961 --> 00:01:45,300
studying,
even the spending of leisure time.

36
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,800
Obviously,
as you might imagine,

37
00:01:46,801 --> 00:01:47,634
all of the best areas and services were 
built for bands used by the white 

38
00:01:50,491 --> 00:01:51,324
population.
A good example of this was the 

39
00:01:52,261 --> 00:01:53,094
ambulances.
Even though the black population where 

40
00:01:54,601 --> 00:01:58,650
80% of the population they barely had 
any ambulances to use.

41
00:01:58,651 --> 00:01:59,484
However,
the ambulances for the white population 

42
00:02:00,751 --> 00:02:01,584
were numerous and refused to carry any 
black passengers because they couldn't 

43
00:02:04,411 --> 00:02:05,430
see according to the law.

44
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:12,240
Okay.
Okay.

45
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:15,973
[inaudible] gave the white population 
all the political power and also 

46
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:19,334
established many limitations precisely 
in order to consolidate that white 

47
00:02:22,551 --> 00:02:23,720
power.
As an example,

48
00:02:23,721 --> 00:02:26,830
mixed race relationships and marriage 
work and for business.

49
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,703
Quite simply,
it left the black population in an 

50
00:02:29,031 --> 00:02:29,864
inhumane

51
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:33,603
be

52
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,760
said that there were two different South
Africa's one black and terribly poor and

53
00:02:39,761 --> 00:02:40,594
the other white,
and it's very wealthy and of course 

54
00:02:42,071 --> 00:02:45,130
those who rebels itself at a terrible 
punishments and repression.

55
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:48,970
On the 16th of June,
1976 thousands of black students went on

56
00:02:48,971 --> 00:02:52,900
the demonstration to demand social and 
educative improvements.

57
00:02:52,930 --> 00:02:54,370
Hundreds of them were massacred.

58
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:57,100
I got into Denmark.
I have this guy in my bag.

59
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,353
I was running over the,
they dumped that just writing away from 

60
00:03:02,351 --> 00:03:07,351
the,
from the police dream,

61
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:13,800
but all that changed in 1994 thanks for 
Nelson Mandela,

62
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:14,693
also known as Madiba.
He was considered the father of the 

63
00:03:17,101 --> 00:03:17,934
country.
Mandela led the political fight against 

64
00:03:21,001 --> 00:03:22,700
apartheid and racism.
God's,

65
00:03:22,701 --> 00:03:23,534
he had to pay for it.
In 1961 he was sentenced to life 

66
00:03:25,831 --> 00:03:26,664
imprisonment for the trail.
Mandela spent 27 years in jail until 

67
00:03:30,331 --> 00:03:31,164
1992 nevertheless,
two years after it was released in 1994 

68
00:03:34,291 --> 00:03:36,210
during the country's first free 
elections,

69
00:03:36,211 --> 00:03:38,520
he was elected as the president of South
Africa,

70
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:41,160
the first black president in the 
country's history.

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:45,203
Often this happens.
Many were surprised to see Mandela 

72
00:03:46,741 --> 00:03:47,574
aiming for reconciliation rather than 
revenge and Della Dreamt of a free your 

73
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:52,980
90 days and it's prosperous South 
Africa.

74
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,990
He made it clear in his inaugural 
speech,

75
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:59,860
we have time and I thought the implant 
hoping the on the Miller of Rp,

76
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,083
we have dry into our covenant that wish 
I healed the society in which all South 

77
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:08,500
Africa can I can.
Why wouldn't be able to walk,

78
00:04:08,501 --> 00:04:11,710
talk without tenure?
Fear in their hearts.

79
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:13,063
I saw off the hype of human dignity.
Grain partners at peace with itself and 

80
00:04:19,061 --> 00:04:19,620
the wealth.

81
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:20,453
Mandela caps is worse.
He works towards the United South 

82
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:24,210
Africa.
It's when the time came,

83
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:26,790
he left power following the limits of 
the constitution.

84
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:28,620
This all turns him into a legend

85
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,280
country.
What does Rebecca for Bay?

86
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:36,800
The past is the past.
We look to the future now.

87
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:37,873
Well,
let's now focus on present day South 

88
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,660
Africa.
It is the only country in the world's to

89
00:04:41,661 --> 00:04:43,730
have three capital cities,
Cape Town,

90
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,593
the capital city for legislative power,
Pretoria for executive power and it's 

91
00:04:47,511 --> 00:04:50,890
blue fontane feed judicial capitol city,
and on top of all that,

92
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:51,793
neither is the most populated.
All the one where most businesses 

93
00:04:54,441 --> 00:04:55,274
concentrates.
For that we have to move to a fourth 

94
00:04:56,871 --> 00:04:57,704
city Johannesburg.
It's even not uncommon for different 

95
00:05:01,611 --> 00:05:05,240
textbooks to stay to different cities as
the capital of South Africa.

96
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,133
Now after the fall of apartheid,
South Africa experienced quite an 

97
00:05:08,601 --> 00:05:13,500
economic boost since 1994 the economy 
considering purchasing power has it

98
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:18,830
great.
He

99
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,613
has been strongly reduced.
Ends a hundreds of thousands of black 

100
00:05:22,901 --> 00:05:26,050
families make it into the middle class 
every single year.

101
00:05:26,110 --> 00:05:26,943
I even Lou violence is still high.
It doesn't need to be said that South 

102
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,753
Africa is quite a violent country.
It has also been reduced further in 

103
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,470
general,
the access to drinkable water,

104
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:38,320
electricity and healthcare has also 
improved quite a lot.

105
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:39,203
Do you illustrate the situation?
South Africa is the biggest tourist 

106
00:05:41,681 --> 00:05:44,470
center and its financial power in the 
south of the continent.

107
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:46,930
It stock market is the most important in
Africa.

108
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:50,140
I did is also an important place for the
automotive industry.

109
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:53,440
Companies such as BMW and General Motors
have factories out.

110
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:55,870
So it all sounds pretty good,
right?

111
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,930
Well things today are not looking that 
rosie crises on stagnation,

112
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:03,493
just licensed numerous achievements.
The economy hasn't changed since 2009 

113
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:09,020
the economy isn't growing.
Unemployment rates,

114
00:06:09,021 --> 00:06:11,150
I'll one of the highest in the world and
in general,

115
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,920
very few people are working the country.

116
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:15,500
It has a population of about 55 million 
people,

117
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:16,334
50 million of which are without work and
as many of the jobs that the people do 

118
00:06:19,041 --> 00:06:20,210
have.
Our informal,

119
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,103
and this is not the only problem.
Investment by companies has also kept a 

120
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,720
decreasing in the last nine years.
It's currency.

121
00:06:26,721 --> 00:06:27,554
The rand is also greatly depreciate it 
and it's public debt is about to be 

122
00:06:30,111 --> 00:06:30,944
declared as junk bonds.
This is a pretty major economic 

123
00:06:33,831 --> 00:06:34,790
disaster.
In fact,

124
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:37,790
in the last years people with money have
begun leaving the country.

125
00:06:37,820 --> 00:06:40,700
So the big question is what happens in 
South Africa?

126
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:45,820
What led to this crisis?
This is Jacob Zuma.

127
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:52,610
He's been in office since 2009 and his 
years in office have been,

128
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:54,260
well,
they've been a giant mess.

129
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,113
My man is facing at 783 corruption cases
and he has been described at being a 

130
00:06:59,601 --> 00:07:02,390
professional ads taking things that are 
not his

131
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,313
South Africa's main opposition party is 
accusing President Jacob Zuma or of 

132
00:07:07,651 --> 00:07:11,600
flagrant abuse of public money is a 
multimillion euro.

133
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:12,463
Upgrades to his home.
Additions to zoomers home include a 

134
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,920
swimming pool,
cattle enclosure and an amphitheater.

135
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:20,023
This is not the only issue.
Mr Zoom is political decisions don't 

136
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:23,804
encourage foreign investment.
Further the president's labor 

137
00:07:25,701 --> 00:07:26,534
regulations.
There are an obstacle when it comes to 

138
00:07:27,531 --> 00:07:28,364
job creation and the regulations are 
getting more and more rigid has last 

139
00:07:31,130 --> 00:07:33,380
idea.
It was a huge raise in the minimum wage.

140
00:07:33,381 --> 00:07:36,560
It's something that doesn't make a bunch
of sense in a country where there are so

141
00:07:36,561 --> 00:07:38,240
few working people.
In fact,

142
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:39,083
many financial analysts have criticized 
the measure by saying it's nonsensical 

143
00:07:42,111 --> 00:07:42,944
to establish a minimum wage,
which amounts do twice as much as half 

144
00:07:45,531 --> 00:07:46,730
of work as I'm making.
Now,

145
00:07:46,731 --> 00:07:49,160
to be honest,
we all do once our salaries to raise,

146
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:50,023
but I think it's a better idea to create
some wealth first if job creation was 

147
00:07:53,481 --> 00:07:54,314
already an issue before,
imagine what's going to happen with 

148
00:07:56,451 --> 00:08:00,080
higher salaries and South Africa has 
other problems too and important.

149
00:08:00,081 --> 00:08:01,940
One is it's problematic education

150
00:08:02,010 --> 00:08:02,843
system,

151
00:08:07,780 --> 00:08:08,613
an awful education system.
The education system in South Africa is 

152
00:08:13,571 --> 00:08:16,630
pretty awful.
Picture this one in every three students

153
00:08:16,631 --> 00:08:17,464
who has attended school for six years 
has difficulty when it comes to 

154
00:08:19,721 --> 00:08:20,554
something as essential as reading and 
only one in every 100 black students 

155
00:08:24,251 --> 00:08:26,680
gets an engineering diploma.
So we can probably,

156
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:27,514
no one understands why.
National companies complain about the 

157
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,680
difficulty of finding skilled labor and 
this has got nothing to do with money.

158
00:08:32,710 --> 00:08:33,543
South Africa is one of the countries 
with the highest investments in 

159
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:36,460
education in the world.

160
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:43,760
The question is,
what is happening?

161
00:08:43,790 --> 00:08:45,170
Well,
according to some people,

162
00:08:45,171 --> 00:08:48,140
the ones who are to blame are the 
Democratic Teacher's Union.

163
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:52,100
They control the state education system 
and it has become something of a Mafia.

164
00:08:52,130 --> 00:08:54,530
The union is an ally of President Zuma 
Zuma.

165
00:08:54,531 --> 00:08:56,850
Besides putting it into education 
supervision,

166
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,030
there's also pulls many strings to get 
more teachers into the system.

167
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,923
This is because the education level of 
teachers themselves to become a very 

168
00:09:03,391 --> 00:09:03,931
low.
Now,

169
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,420
a few years ago,
maths teachers in the country were given

170
00:09:06,421 --> 00:09:07,254
a task.
These teachers were teaching math to 11 

171
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:10,620
and 12 year olds.
What was the result?

172
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:11,483
Well,
eight hours of these teachers got lower 

173
00:09:12,841 --> 00:09:13,674
results and we're expected of their 
students and to be honest in maths is 

174
00:09:17,371 --> 00:09:20,430
not exactly one of president zoom as 
strong suits.

175
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:25,580
This is President Zuma attempting to say
769,817

176
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:31,720
769 800 ten seven hundred one property,
810 20

177
00:09:38,120 --> 00:09:38,953
no

178
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:40,950
via sneak the results for white 
students.

179
00:09:40,951 --> 00:09:43,070
So you go to private schools are far 
better.

180
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,460
This shows that maybe some of the 
apartheid heritage is still very much in

181
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:47,294
a fact

182
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:50,750
race.

183
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:54,260
So conflict if these problems weren't 
bad enough.

184
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:58,070
Racial conflict in South Africa has also
been growing in the last few years.

185
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:01,370
The economic freedom fighters is a 
radical political party that was founded

186
00:10:01,371 --> 00:10:05,990
in 2015 this party is an lv third 
largest force in the country.

187
00:10:06,020 --> 00:10:10,180
Some of its members are suggesting to 
almost inverted apartheid and plants and

188
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:12,530
the white population.
It is still a minority party,

189
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:15,200
but is an element of subversion.
It is working quite well.

190
00:10:15,201 --> 00:10:17,600
So anyway,
it now it looks as if Mandela's dream,

191
00:10:17,750 --> 00:10:18,583
it's now in danger.
So this is what we think here of Israel 

192
00:10:20,271 --> 00:10:21,470
politic.
But what do you think,

193
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,333
do you think the South Africa will 
continue to pursue Nelson Mandela's 

194
00:10:24,501 --> 00:10:25,334
dream?
Do you think it will become the most 

195
00:10:26,091 --> 00:10:28,040
prosperous nation in Africa?
Once again,

196
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:29,000
what'd you think?
Hatred,

197
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:30,530
distrust,
and bad politics.

198
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:31,364
We'll try and do.
