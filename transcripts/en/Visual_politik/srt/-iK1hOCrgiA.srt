1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,330
History has shown us that sometimes the 
impossible happens.

2
00:00:03,331 --> 00:00:06,900
Mikhail Gorbachev went from leading of a
Soviet Union,

3
00:00:15,310 --> 00:00:18,310
the face as a North American 
multinational company.

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:25,490
Sometimes nothing brings people 
together.

5
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,083
Pizza,

6
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:37,250
so will we ever see something like this 
in North Korea?

7
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:38,540
Well,
listen up.

8
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:50,120
North Korea is a very,
very poor country.

9
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:50,983
The available estimates state that their
per capita production value is 50 times 

10
00:00:53,811 --> 00:00:58,010
smaller than that of South Korea.
Less than 1000 kilometers of their roads

11
00:00:58,011 --> 00:00:58,844
are paved.
The average life expectancy is the 

12
00:01:00,411 --> 00:01:04,310
lowest in the entire region,
and despite having received humanitarian

13
00:01:04,311 --> 00:01:08,810
aid for more than 22 years,
there's still poverty all over.

14
00:01:08,811 --> 00:01:09,644
The country

15
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:19,740
is not even the west of it.
The worst is a total lack of respect for

16
00:01:19,741 --> 00:01:20,574
human rights.
The North Koreans live under an iron 

17
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:23,670
pans,
dictatorship,

18
00:01:23,671 --> 00:01:24,504
and the police state where political 
prisoners amounts to tens and tens of 

19
00:01:27,901 --> 00:01:29,040
thousands.
In fact,

20
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:29,933
according to the United Nations,
there could be between 80 and a hundred 

21
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:38,030
and 20,000 political prisoners in 
reeducation camps in North Korea.

22
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:39,353
The state controls everything,
but hold on just a moment because in 

23
00:01:43,111 --> 00:01:47,640
recent years and important change seems 
to have occurred in the country a change

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,520
that has a lot to do with money,
with commerce into,

25
00:01:50,521 --> 00:01:53,400
with the market.
You see theoretically North Korea as the

26
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:54,234
last large country,
the last launch state with a communist 

27
00:01:56,821 --> 00:01:59,880
ideology here practically everything is 
directed,

28
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,440
organized,
manufactured,

29
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:04,350
and provided for by the state,
including housing,

30
00:02:04,351 --> 00:02:05,280
health,
education,

31
00:02:05,281 --> 00:02:06,420
food,
employments,

32
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:06,910
access.

33
00:02:06,910 --> 00:02:07,743
True.

34
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,320
This is all in theory and the truth.
The truth is very different.

35
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,213
You see,
the states has a great deal of 

36
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,980
limitations.
Basically,

37
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:20,830
it's becoming less and less able to do 
stuff.

38
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:22,540
Allow me to explain.
Many of the states,

39
00:02:22,541 --> 00:02:23,374
factories and farms productivity levels 
are absolutely on the floor and 

40
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,360
additionally in many cases,
as a result of very old machinery,

41
00:02:32,361 --> 00:02:35,000
backwoods production methods,
international sanctions,

42
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:38,450
and even electrical supply problems for 
a great part of their time.

43
00:02:38,451 --> 00:02:40,210
Production centers,
they aren't even open.

44
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:43,250
Did all

45
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,083
of this.
A new private economy has gained 

46
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:46,603
strength in recent years from which more
and more North Koreans now depends in 

47
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:52,700
order to survive and improve their 
living standards.

48
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:53,990
Now,
hold on just a second,

49
00:02:53,991 --> 00:02:58,010
because a private sector in North Korea 
with markets and with capitalism,

50
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:58,903
it sounds pretty,
but you absolutely have to write and 

51
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,200
listen to this

52
00:03:08,690 --> 00:03:09,850
new North Korean market.

53
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,723
Yeah,

54
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,353
dvr.
When Kim Jon was officially declared 

55
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:15,933
supreme leader,
that is the absolute dictator of North 

56
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:20,680
Korea on December the 28th,
2011,

57
00:03:20,681 --> 00:03:23,890
many analysts thought that things could 
change in the country.

58
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:26,323
At the end of the day.
This was a generational change that was 

59
00:03:28,821 --> 00:03:32,930
bringing a 28 year olds in the power 
that 28 year olds who had studied abroad

60
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,110
in Switzerland.
However,

61
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:37,280
it became clear that some things weren't
going to change.

62
00:03:37,281 --> 00:03:41,040
North Korea's new leader,
Kim Jong UN has turned out to be just as

63
00:03:41,041 --> 00:03:43,270
terrible as his father was.
The purges,

64
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,220
the inhuman punishments,
the rampant persecution,

65
00:03:46,221 --> 00:03:48,200
the leader centered Coulson's.
In short,

66
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:49,053
you complete control of citizens' lives 
have continued to being this regimes 

67
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:54,290
main characteristics,

68
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:58,730
religion from birth.
You've learned about the Kim family,

69
00:03:58,790 --> 00:03:59,623
learned that they are gods,
that you must be absolutely obedient to 

70
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:04,064
the Kim family.
The elites are treated nicely and 

71
00:04:05,631 --> 00:04:09,440
because of that they make sure that the 
system stays stable,

72
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:11,630
but for everyone else it's a reign of 
terror.

73
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,950
A doctor who worked at a hospital in 
North Korea and now works as a doctor at

74
00:04:15,951 --> 00:04:17,300
a hospital in South Korea,

75
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:19,940
however they have you a sentence can.
Johnathan came to power.

76
00:04:19,941 --> 00:04:20,774
Something surprising has happened,
dozens of markets when North Koreans 

77
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:26,210
trade privately have opened throughout 
the country,

78
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:30,290
a new class of merchants and 
entrepreneurs is growing in North Korea.

79
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:34,413
In fact,
according to the Career Institute for 

80
00:04:35,530 --> 00:04:40,150
National Unification around 1 million 
people working directly in these markets

81
00:04:40,151 --> 00:04:43,180
which have already become one of the 
main sources of wealth in the country.

82
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,190
Now,
you want me to run during right now,

83
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,880
but Simon,
hold on a second.

84
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,070
How did those markets kind of out?
Well,

85
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:52,904
let me tell you first that they don't 
have the most glamorous or happiest of 

86
00:04:56,751 --> 00:05:01,460
beginnings.
You see,

87
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:06,140
it all started in the 19 nineties when 
famine caused by government mistakes,

88
00:05:06,141 --> 00:05:07,880
lack of resources,
weather conditions,

89
00:05:07,881 --> 00:05:11,420
and the collapse of the Soviet Union 
reeks absolute havoc.

90
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:13,483
Tree

91
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:18,970
midstate,
the between one to 2 million people died

92
00:05:18,971 --> 00:05:19,804
of starvation right at the time when 
North Koreans were struggling to 

93
00:05:22,421 --> 00:05:24,040
survive.
The first markets arose,

94
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,033
places where people could exchange 
anything they could to get resources 

95
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,980
with which they could buy food,

96
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:33,120
realize that if we did nothing,
we would die of hunger.

97
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,340
So we started to trade Ju Yung

98
00:05:35,490 --> 00:05:36,323
suddenly dozens and dozens of markets 
appeared throughout the country saving 

99
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:40,463
thousands and thousands of lives.
That's precisely why the regime didn't 

100
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,390
persecute to this type of private 
activity,

101
00:05:45,420 --> 00:05:49,160
as you might expect.
Kim Jong,

102
00:05:49,161 --> 00:05:50,430
Il,
the current leaders.

103
00:05:50,431 --> 00:05:51,264
Father,
let's just say that sometimes he 

104
00:05:52,441 --> 00:05:55,830
tolerated these markets and sometimes he
decided to repress them.

105
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:59,710
But since Kim Jong Uhm,
came to power,

106
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:00,573
the number of private markets is 
multiplied and satellite images show 

107
00:06:03,501 --> 00:06:04,334
that they don't stop growing.
Now the government government's 

108
00:06:06,021 --> 00:06:06,854
authorized as many of these markets and 
exchange for renting out spaces to the 

109
00:06:09,681 --> 00:06:10,514
nutshell.

110
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:13,570
Yep,

111
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,403
that's right.
The Pyongyang government is taking 

112
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:19,010
advantage of this new private economy,
but well,

113
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:20,050
how much?
Well,

114
00:06:20,051 --> 00:06:23,200
according to the Career Institute for 
National Unification is calculations.

115
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:27,310
They get more than 220,000 American 
dollars per day,

116
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:28,173
so precisely for this reason recently 
the government isn't only promoting 

117
00:06:31,211 --> 00:06:32,044
these markets,
but it's also granting visas to many 

118
00:06:33,731 --> 00:06:34,564
Chinese entrepreneurs and traders to 
further stimulate this economic 

119
00:06:37,841 --> 00:06:38,674
activity,
but to you it does not end that because 

120
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,003
while listening to this,
it's only the activity of regulated 

121
00:06:56,731 --> 00:06:59,970
markets that's growing.
It's also of the unofficial markets.

122
00:06:59,971 --> 00:07:03,300
That is those that don't have the 
authorities official approval,

123
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,163
the black market.
Seeing this all works in the following 

124
00:07:07,531 --> 00:07:08,364
way,
in an economic parallel to the public 

125
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:11,310
sector.
People can make everything.

126
00:07:11,311 --> 00:07:14,730
They can choose sweets,
clothes and naturally they tried to sell

127
00:07:14,731 --> 00:07:17,820
these products in the market and to get 
money and the currencies,

128
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:21,420
they're hoping for probably 10 or even 
American dollars,

129
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,943
but even so,
it's estimated that 80 percent of the 

130
00:07:25,301 --> 00:07:28,330
product sold in North Korean markets 
come from China.

131
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,650
In other words,
illegal trade,

132
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:32,680
which happens behind the government's 
back also crosses the border.

133
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:36,610
It's crossing the border in huge and 
ever growing volume.

134
00:07:41,990 --> 00:07:42,823
Many of these unofficial markets are 
becoming a window to the outside world 

135
00:07:45,841 --> 00:07:49,020
for many North Koreans because Dvo in 
these places,

136
00:07:49,021 --> 00:07:49,854
you can even buy a usb stick full of a 
foreign movies and shows including 

137
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,550
Hollywood productions.
We saw four and programming.

138
00:07:56,551 --> 00:07:57,384
We had to close all the doors and 
curtains and pretend that there was 

139
00:07:59,731 --> 00:08:02,850
nobody home.
Dan became so you might be wondering,

140
00:08:02,851 --> 00:08:04,740
well,
contraband crossing borders,

141
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:08,010
why aren't gods in the security services
doing something about this?

142
00:08:08,011 --> 00:08:10,620
Why are they tolerating this illegal 
trade?

143
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,640
Well,
basically for two reasons,

144
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:14,213
the

145
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,583
is that in Pyongyang there doesn't seem 
to be much pressure to combat these 

146
00:08:19,531 --> 00:08:23,160
markets and we're going to see wine and 
moments and seconds because the soldiers

147
00:08:23,161 --> 00:08:23,994
and border guards are also a part of the
business and sometimes even lends a 

148
00:08:27,501 --> 00:08:32,501
hand.
That's right.

149
00:08:32,660 --> 00:08:36,020
A common method of payments according to
many of the traders who now live outside

150
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:36,854
of North Korea,
is to deliver packs of cigarettes 

151
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,430
stuffed with money to the police and 
soldiers.

152
00:08:42,350 --> 00:08:43,183
While the fact is that these 
international merchants byproducts in 

153
00:08:45,561 --> 00:08:46,394
the North Korean authorized markets or 
the black market and then transfer them 

154
00:08:49,161 --> 00:08:49,994
to try and sell them and with that money
they buy Chinese products and take them 

155
00:08:52,881 --> 00:08:56,010
back to North Korea to sell.
It's the process as oldest

156
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,193
self

157
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,500
and here within this world of 
international trade is where a new class

158
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,363
is emerging.
Individuals who usually have power or 

159
00:09:07,351 --> 00:09:08,184
influence or dealings with high 
officials who were making serious money 

160
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:11,933
and by the way that driving a lot of 
activities that have nothing to do with 

161
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:18,510
the old socialist model within Pyongyang
itself.

162
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:23,100
The salary for doctors,
it was about 3,501 a month.

163
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,040
That was less than a cost by one 
kilogram of rice.

164
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,830
So of course being a doctor was not my 
main job.

165
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:29,873
My main job was smuggling.
At night I would send herbal medicine 

166
00:09:32,761 --> 00:09:33,594
from North Korea into China with the 
money I would import home appliances 

167
00:09:36,571 --> 00:09:38,640
back into North Korea.
Rice cookers,

168
00:09:38,730 --> 00:09:40,830
no tells,
LCD monitors,

169
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,773
that kind of thing.
A doctor who worked at a hospital in 

170
00:09:43,411 --> 00:09:46,470
high San North Korea is an anecdote 
today,

171
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:47,333
for example,
you can buy coca cola in the streets of 

172
00:09:48,991 --> 00:09:52,080
Pyongyang and according to the South 
Korean intelligence service,

173
00:09:52,081 --> 00:09:52,914
at least 40 percent of all North Koreans
participate in private activities and 

174
00:09:56,671 --> 00:09:58,110
businesses in some way.

175
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:00,810
That might be surprising to you,
but there's still more here.

176
00:10:00,870 --> 00:10:03,210
But before we get into all of that is an
important note.

177
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:07,080
We're talking about a very incipient 
process in North Korea.

178
00:10:07,081 --> 00:10:09,240
The government still controls virtually 
everything.

179
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,103
If these black markets are growing,
it's because they're being allowed to 

180
00:10:12,781 --> 00:10:13,614
grow.
This is likely because they're more 

181
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:15,690
efficient.
They work,

182
00:10:15,691 --> 00:10:16,524
that's a.
They give the government money and they 

183
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:21,180
allow North Koreans to find a way to 
improve their living standards.

184
00:10:21,210 --> 00:10:22,043
Something very similar happens in the 
Soviet Union and in Vietnam and of 

185
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:27,870
course in China.
So now let's have a look at what else is

186
00:10:27,871 --> 00:10:32,871
happening.
Reforms made in China,

187
00:10:40,270 --> 00:10:41,103
class of merchants and entrepreneurs 
that is emerging as a name among North 

188
00:10:45,010 --> 00:10:45,930
Koreans,
the Dome Jew,

189
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,740
and as you can imagine,
many of them,

190
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,633
especially those who really make money 
are people who belong to the Communist 

191
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,833
Party,
ends are well connected in the 

192
00:10:53,501 --> 00:10:54,334
government

193
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,580
to say they aren't a part of the elite 
which they take advantage of,

194
00:11:00,581 --> 00:11:03,150
not only need to get special treatment 
from the security forces,

195
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:06,580
but also to reach advantages.
Agreements with public companies.

196
00:11:06,610 --> 00:11:07,443
There are clear suspicions that many 
irregular exports are manufactured by 

197
00:11:10,571 --> 00:11:11,404
public companies,
but the benefits go to these elite 

198
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,850
members.
However,

199
00:11:15,851 --> 00:11:19,360
this new economic approach isn't 
something that bothers the Pyongyang.

200
00:11:19,361 --> 00:11:20,350
Governments,
in fact,

201
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:23,710
everything indicates that the North 
Korean government wants to reproduce the

202
00:11:23,711 --> 00:11:24,544
Chinese model in some way.
That is to seek foreign investment that 

203
00:11:27,161 --> 00:11:31,090
will allow them to grow and develop that
without losing political control.

204
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:35,340
See,

205
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,173
since Kim Jong came to power,
his government has granted more freedom 

206
00:11:38,581 --> 00:11:39,414
to public companies so that they can 
organize as they wish and to find their 

207
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:44,880
own suppliers and customers.
It is also promoted,

208
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:45,773
as we've seen private markets.
They turned a blind eye to the black 

209
00:11:47,911 --> 00:11:51,420
markets and families and collective 
funds now have individual plots assigned

210
00:11:51,421 --> 00:11:53,950
to them who's harvest once they meet the
state.

211
00:11:53,951 --> 00:11:54,784
Criteria can be used as they wish.
They can of course then sell it in the 

212
00:11:57,671 --> 00:11:58,504
private market.
North Korea has even started talking 

213
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,233
about special economic zones,
but I must stress here that this is all 

214
00:12:03,970 --> 00:12:05,650
a very new process.

215
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:09,603
This doesn't mean this.
A radical change is going to happen in 

216
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:12,364
the short term.
That's due to the official systems in 

217
00:12:13,661 --> 00:12:14,494
capacity.
The North Koreans are developing an 

218
00:12:15,971 --> 00:12:16,804
alternative to improve their standard of
living and even though unfortunately 

219
00:12:22,151 --> 00:12:22,984
North Korea is still the totalitarian 
and poor country that it was before Kim 

220
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,273
Jong Un's arrival.
You contemplate that this new kinds of 

221
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:31,750
parallel economy's growth is somewhat 
surprising.

222
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:32,643
That now is your sound.
Do you think that North Korea will try 

223
00:12:34,241 --> 00:12:35,860
to follow the Chinese model?
Well,
