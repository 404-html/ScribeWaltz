1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,853
it's throwing.
You might be a country that you've only 

3
00:00:09,761 --> 00:00:12,190
heard about on the Eurovision song 
contest.

4
00:00:12,191 --> 00:00:13,024
If you watch the Eurovision song contest
where the reality is that Estonia is a 

5
00:00:16,931 --> 00:00:17,764
pioneer in country in many fields,
some might even call it the Silicon 

6
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:23,253
Valley of Europe.
Companies like skype and transfer wise 

7
00:00:24,641 --> 00:00:25,474
were created in Estonia.
This is particularly surprising given 

8
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,200
the just 30 years ago,
Estonia was a part of the Soviet Union.

9
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:33,153
In fact,
the geographically Astonia situation is 

10
00:00:34,991 --> 00:00:35,824
far from being ideal there.
Weather is pretty terrible and in the 

11
00:00:38,981 --> 00:00:42,470
winter they have as little less three 
hours of daylight every day.

12
00:00:45,290 --> 00:00:46,123
They also have an ongoing demographic 
crisis that they are really struggling 

13
00:00:48,581 --> 00:00:50,860
to solve further,
unlike most countries,

14
00:00:50,861 --> 00:00:51,694
the female population of this stonier is
markedly higher than the male 

15
00:00:54,401 --> 00:00:57,250
population.
This means that people find it harder to

16
00:00:57,251 --> 00:01:01,810
find a partner and have children.
This is why every year Estonia maintains

17
00:01:01,811 --> 00:01:05,470
the course of population reduction and 
yet despite all of this,

18
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:09,760
Estonia is the most technologically 
advanced nation in all of Europe.

19
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:10,653
In fact,
it is the only country in Europe where 

20
00:01:11,891 --> 00:01:15,160
access to the Internet is recognized in 
the constitution,

21
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:16,143
but what really makes us stoney or get 
into our countries all of fame is it's 

22
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:24,090
your residence.
This means that a person,

23
00:01:24,681 --> 00:01:25,514
no matter where they are from can simply
fill out a form and is become a virtual 

24
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:29,264
citizen of Estonia.
But the question you might have in your 

25
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:34,670
mind right now is,
but what does that really mean today?

26
00:01:34,671 --> 00:01:37,040
We are going to explain this to you in 
this video,

27
00:01:37,041 --> 00:01:39,800
but first let's have a quick look at the
history of stds.

28
00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:41,413
Yeah.

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,153
It's big themes of Vladimir Poutine in 
1991 is stonier got its independence 

30
00:01:47,421 --> 00:01:49,040
from the Soviet Union.
Yes.

31
00:01:49,041 --> 00:01:51,200
Other countries like Belarus and 
Ukraine,

32
00:01:51,201 --> 00:01:52,034
God,
their independence at around the same 

33
00:01:52,891 --> 00:01:53,100
time

34
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:53,933
time,

35
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:58,550
those countries,
the new political establishment that had

36
00:01:58,551 --> 00:02:03,440
a lot of influence from the old 
communist elite Estonia was different.

37
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:04,513
Their first democratic Prime Minister 
Martin Law Form Day cabinets with an 

38
00:02:07,611 --> 00:02:12,410
average age of just 30 years old.
These were young people with new ideas.

39
00:02:12,411 --> 00:02:17,030
You had no dance to the old Soviet guard
and this is how it's stonier opens their

40
00:02:17,031 --> 00:02:17,864
markets to the international economy.
They adopted a capitalist system and a 

41
00:02:21,301 --> 00:02:22,134
fairly unique political system that 
would become well known for its 

42
00:02:25,401 --> 00:02:26,750
minimalism.
In fact,

43
00:02:26,751 --> 00:02:27,584
it is this word minimalism that really 
describes a stony are better than any 

44
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,394
other,
even if their flag as minimalist and is 

45
00:02:33,081 --> 00:02:35,590
simply a representation of their 
traditional lands.

46
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:39,930
Even their taxation

47
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,600
is minimalist and they have a flat rate 
tax system.

48
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:46,680
This means that everyone in the country 
pays the same percentage of tax,

49
00:02:46,681 --> 00:02:49,980
no matter how much they earn.
In this case in Estonia,

50
00:02:49,981 --> 00:02:53,130
the income tax is just 20% with these 
policies,

51
00:02:53,131 --> 00:02:56,070
it's easy to see why your stone,
you're attracted foreign investments,

52
00:02:56,071 --> 00:02:58,590
particularly from the Scandinavian 
countries.

53
00:02:58,680 --> 00:02:59,513
Nonetheless,
this was still not enough for them to 

54
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,014
grow at the rate they want it at the 
beginning of the 1990 is less than a 

55
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:07,900
half of the population had a phone in 
their home.

56
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:08,973
Further.
The infrastructure which was built 

57
00:03:09,911 --> 00:03:12,310
during the Soviet era was far for an 
acceptable,

58
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:13,263
as you can imagine,
this is not a great setup for a country 

59
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:17,560
if it isn't looking for economic 
development.

60
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,620
Since the country you had no money to 
invest in physical roads,

61
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,860
they instead decided to invest in 
virtual roads,

62
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:26,680
be countries,
telecommunications infrastructure,

63
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,573
and just 15 years later it's stonier was
the first country in the world to have 

64
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:35,440
an electronic voting system.
Hold on for just a second because all of

65
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:38,230
these reforms didn't exactly come for 
free.

66
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:40,660
During these 15 years of forward 
progress,

67
00:03:40,661 --> 00:03:43,180
the Russian minority,
which used to rule the country,

68
00:03:43,181 --> 00:03:45,640
became increasingly politically 
isolated.

69
00:03:45,730 --> 00:03:49,880
This is why in 2007 the Kremlin under 
Vladimir Putin decided,

70
00:03:49,881 --> 00:03:50,714
yeah,

71
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:55,580
and this is how the first cyber attack 
in history,

72
00:03:55,581 --> 00:03:56,414
it was organized and yes,
a cyber attack on a country that relied 

73
00:03:59,211 --> 00:04:02,660
heavily on its digital infrastructure 
was a big problem.

74
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:05,510
During the attack,
Estonia lost its administration,

75
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,290
which was so dramatic that even 
hospitals were not able to function.

76
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,153
This is why since that day,
Nita has had its cybersecurity 

77
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:15,120
headquarters in Tallinn,
the Estonian capital bars.

78
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:20,200
This was not the end of Estonia has 
problems manage.

79
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,700
She'll crisis.
Two years later,

80
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:27,620
in 2009 the financial crisis struck 
Estonia hot the country.

81
00:04:27,621 --> 00:04:30,860
It was particularly exposed because of 
all its foreign investments.

82
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:33,320
All of a sudden,
the country had no money.

83
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:34,213
Plus this was the time when they were 
supposed to adopt the euro as their 

84
00:04:36,921 --> 00:04:37,754
currency.
So even if they wanted to make the 

85
00:04:39,171 --> 00:04:40,004
switch to the euro,
they didn't have the funds to make that 

86
00:04:41,991 --> 00:04:44,450
happen.
So the government had two options.

87
00:04:44,451 --> 00:04:47,210
They could either cut their spending or 
they can raise taxes.

88
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,060
Unlike other countries like Spain,
Estonia took the first option.

89
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:58,073
In a matter of months,
the government fired over 10,000 

90
00:05:00,361 --> 00:05:01,194
workers.
This was about a third of their entire 

91
00:05:03,361 --> 00:05:05,500
staff,
politicians and lowered their salary.

92
00:05:05,501 --> 00:05:06,334
Reason froze all state investments,
which included many construction 

93
00:05:08,821 --> 00:05:09,654
projects.
All of these carts caused the Estonian 

94
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:13,163
GDP to fall by a 14% in that year to 
make a comparison in their worst year 

95
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:18,534
during the financial crisis,
the u s or their GDP fall by 8% 

96
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,433
nonetheless,
after going through a terrible 2009 

97
00:05:24,211 --> 00:05:27,190
Estonia saw its economy began to improve
almost to me.

98
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:28,024
Yeah.

99
00:05:32,180 --> 00:05:33,013
Since they didn't raise their taxes and 
business policies remained very 

100
00:05:35,211 --> 00:05:36,044
flexible.
Many of those who lost their jobs at 

101
00:05:37,730 --> 00:05:41,060
decided to start companies.
So now let's have a look at that.

102
00:05:41,061 --> 00:05:41,894
Unemployment shot between 2008 and 2009 
is through near went from a 4% 

103
00:05:46,191 --> 00:05:47,024
unemployment rate to a 19% unemployment 
rate at the time that this was the 

104
00:05:50,781 --> 00:05:52,850
highest unemployment rate in all of 
Europe,

105
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,360
even higher than Greece and Spain.
However,

106
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:56,750
the interest,
two years,

107
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,643
they cut this in half and now they have 
an admirable 6% unemployment rate and 

108
00:06:02,561 --> 00:06:03,394
it's the same goes for their salaries.
Today a person working in Tallinn is 

109
00:06:06,350 --> 00:06:09,770
lung thing to be making more money than 
most people in southern Europe.

110
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:10,783
In summary,
Estonia is a model for other countries 

111
00:06:12,891 --> 00:06:13,724
to follow and now we're going to have a 
look at the key aspects of this country 

112
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,900
which did make it quite so sick.

113
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:18,883
Assassin

114
00:06:22,260 --> 00:06:27,210
ministration it's Tony a pioneer,
the idea of creating a digital id card.

115
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:28,133
Now many other countries have been 
copying this model but it's not 

116
00:06:30,091 --> 00:06:33,110
something that has ever been as 
successful as it wasn't a stone yet.

117
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,013
The reason that it is so successful in 
Estonia is because this ID card is 

118
00:06:37,021 --> 00:06:39,120
actually useful.
For instance,

119
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:39,983
during the elections,
any Estonian citizen can take this med 

120
00:06:42,481 --> 00:06:43,314
card,
it cause you any computer and vote 

121
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,653
electronically from wherever they are.
There is no need for any sort of 

122
00:06:49,111 --> 00:06:49,944
registration.
This is incredibly useful if you are on 

123
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:54,970
holiday during an election or if you are
someone who did something

124
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:57,893
every,

125
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:01,270
no yours,
the hassle of voting while abroad having

126
00:07:01,271 --> 00:07:04,600
to go to the embassy and cast a ballot,
it's all a big headache.

127
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:06,430
Further,
in addition to all of this hassle,

128
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:10,120
there have been cases where boots from 
abroad have simply been lost further.

129
00:07:10,121 --> 00:07:10,954
In Estonia,
you can use this ID card to do any sort 

130
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:13,864
of government business and that includes
paying your taxes and forget about all 

131
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:19,780
of those long forms that are the tax 
authorities making.

132
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:20,300
Yeah,

133
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,133
lounge.

134
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:24,081
Darn.
Yeah.

135
00:07:24,081 --> 00:07:28,210
You can do everything from your mobile 
phone in a matter of minutes.

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,073
In fact,
the government has access to the banks 

137
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:31,413
so they can simply find your income.
This happens in every other country 

138
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,053
including the u s the only difference is
that in Estonia they think it's stupid 

139
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:39,394
to ask her the same question twice.
So you simply go over your citizen 

140
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:43,504
profile,
confirm that everything's correct and 

141
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:46,960
pay your taxes just like that.

142
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:50,470
Bye.

143
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,650
Hold on for one minutes because the best
is yet to come.

144
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:54,663
Imagine that an unscrupulous government 
employee you wants to spy on your 

145
00:07:57,191 --> 00:08:00,010
personal data.
Well then when that happens you will get

146
00:08:00,011 --> 00:08:02,470
a notification on your government's 
profile.

147
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:05,680
You can even see exactly who that 
governments employee is,

148
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,514
who is looking at your data and then if 
you want so you can ask them why they 

149
00:08:09,491 --> 00:08:10,324
aren't doing it.
This means Estonia in this regard has a 

150
00:08:15,911 --> 00:08:18,700
way more transparency than any other 
democracy,

151
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:20,590
but if you still think this is not 
enough,

152
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:23,410
here's the part that really puts Estonia
over the,

153
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:26,553
yes,

154
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,953
he residency.
We've all heard about these big 

155
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:30,594
companies that place that fiscal 
headquarters in places like Panama or 

156
00:08:33,331 --> 00:08:34,530
Luxembourg.
However,

157
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:38,810
this kind of tax structure is almost 
impossible for a freelancer or an SME.

158
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,580
I live in Luxembourg and if you want to 
start a company in Luxembourg,

159
00:08:41,581 --> 00:08:43,800
you have to go.
You have to start by going to the notary

160
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,023
and to go to the notes or it takes you 
three weeks to get an appointment and 

161
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:48,834
then you have to pay a lot of money on.
There's an awful lot of bureaucracy and 

162
00:08:50,731 --> 00:08:51,540
everything like that.

163
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,373
Well,
in Estonia they realized that they 

164
00:08:53,581 --> 00:08:55,710
needed and you citizens,
as I said,

165
00:08:55,711 --> 00:08:58,220
the country faces a demographic crisis 
and well,

166
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,460
welfare,
weather socks.

167
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:00,323
That is why in 2014 they decided to 
offer their cutting edge infrastructure 

168
00:09:03,721 --> 00:09:06,870
to the whole world no matter where you 
come from and so you might,

169
00:09:06,871 --> 00:09:09,060
no one's out.
Why is this quite so useful?

170
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:16,540
Of course this is not the same as an 
actual citizenship and you can't use the

171
00:09:16,541 --> 00:09:21,040
residency as a passport,
but it is a digital identity issued by a

172
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:21,874
European governments and this certainly 
helps if you want to make international 

173
00:09:24,881 --> 00:09:27,520
transactions or open a bank accounts.
In Estonia,

174
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:31,270
this might be particularly useful if you
are watching this video from places like

175
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:34,810
the Ukraine or weld Venezuela.
The virtual card also makes it very easy

176
00:09:34,811 --> 00:09:35,644
for you to establish a company in 
Estonia and you can do that without 

177
00:09:38,051 --> 00:09:40,160
having to move there or do a lot of 
complicated.

178
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:41,403
Wow.

179
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,193
Okay.
Well now I hear you saying is stony is 

180
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:48,230
got to be a fiscal haven,
right?

181
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,910
Well,
actually no,

182
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:53,840
corporate tax is 20% which is the same 
as Finland's for example.

183
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:57,290
What is thrown at really offers is two 
main things,

184
00:09:57,350 --> 00:09:59,680
simplicity and to rule of law.
No,

185
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:01,550
maybe you think that is too little to 
offer,

186
00:10:01,551 --> 00:10:02,384
but the reality is over 10,000 people 
have already signed up for this virtual 

187
00:10:05,901 --> 00:10:06,734
residency.
One of them is actually the Japanese 

188
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:13,391
Prime Minister Shinzo Abe.
In other words,

189
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:16,960
it's Stonier has invented a brand's new 
concepts.

190
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:19,620
The concept of liquid citizens.

191
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,410
I know it is all big question for you.
Do you think other countries will follow

192
00:10:26,411 --> 00:10:27,244
the Estonian model?
Do you think there is a time when 

193
00:10:29,141 --> 00:10:31,080
everyone were ones who were racist,
stony,

194
00:10:31,081 --> 00:10:33,800
and citizenship?

202

203
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,453

yeah.
