1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,850
It's finally here off several failures 
and a few scandals.

2
00:00:02,851 --> 00:00:03,684
2017 closed with Donald Trump hands,
the republican party's first major 

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:08,064
political victory since the presidential
elections that landed the well known 

4
00:00:10,591 --> 00:00:13,230
casino and property developments magnate
in the Oval Office.

5
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:19,481
Oh,
of course.

6
00:00:19,481 --> 00:00:23,500
Talking about the tax reform that after 
being approved by Congress was signed by

7
00:00:23,501 --> 00:00:26,890
President Trump on December the 22nd 
2017

8
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:31,310
three point $2 trillion in tax cuts for 
American families,

9
00:00:31,311 --> 00:00:32,144
including the doubling of the standard 
deduction and the doubling of the child 

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:37,520
tax credit.

11
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,510
This is,
as I'm sure you've heard,

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:40,373
the largest tax reform in 30 years.
The impacts and the controls have been 

13
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:45,263
massive,
and that's appropriate for the 

14
00:00:46,711 --> 00:00:48,270
importance of this political

15
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:49,223
events.

16
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:56,590
Print supporters.
The tax reform is a real revolution,

17
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:57,433
as many qualifiers as the biggest tax 
reduction in the history of the United 

18
00:01:01,420 --> 00:01:03,880
States.
This is good for American business.

19
00:01:03,881 --> 00:01:04,714
It's good for the American economy,
and it's good for the American people 

20
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,020
for its detractors.
However,

21
00:01:08,021 --> 00:01:11,800
the reform is poorly developed and lies 
far from the promises that the president

22
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:13,430
made during his electoral campaign

23
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,160
tax.
The florists.

24
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,560
People.
Okay.

25
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,650
All right.
Other 35,000 book will be taxed the most

26
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:21,753
under 75,000 will be the second highest 
tech and the billionaires and the 

27
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:27,970
millionaires get a tax guy.
What's wrong with this picture?

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,260
So I think the questions to be asked 
here are very clear.

29
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:32,790
We have to ask what's true in all of 
this,

30
00:01:32,791 --> 00:01:36,720
what's it really all about and is it as 
large as people are saying?

31
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:39,000
And ultimately what can everyone expect 
from this?

32
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,320
Well,
let's have a look.

33
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,080
Okay.

34
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:49,913
In this video where they explored the 
positive and also the not so positive 

35
00:01:52,561 --> 00:01:53,394
aspects of a reform that is its first 
consequence as managed to calm the 

36
00:01:55,951 --> 00:01:56,784
waters in the Republican party in a way,
reconcile Donald Trump with the party 

37
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:05,010
leaders of both chambers of Congress and
given how things were going after a year

38
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:08,940
of taunts attacks and mistrust,
this is really worth acknowledging.

39
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:12,660
Check out what the media says.
Just a few short months ago,

40
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:17,290
president had been a very focused,
of course on a well his twitter account.

41
00:02:17,291 --> 00:02:18,124
He fired off another twitter storm 
yesterday about his frustrations with 

42
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:23,050
party leaders,
Mitch Mcconnell and Paul Ryan.

43
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,420
I with all the invitee?
No,

44
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,263
in the GOP.
Do Democrats have a political advantage 

45
00:02:27,791 --> 00:02:28,120
now?

46
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,990
Well,
before we go on,

47
00:02:29,020 --> 00:02:32,020
what can we expect?
Let's see what this law at tax reduction

48
00:02:32,021 --> 00:02:34,180
within the United States really means.
Well,

49
00:02:34,181 --> 00:02:35,014
the first question we need to answer is 
how much does it really actually reduce 

50
00:02:38,091 --> 00:02:38,924
taxes?
Is this really the biggest tax drop in 

51
00:02:41,441 --> 00:02:42,560
US history?
Now,

52
00:02:42,561 --> 00:02:45,460
Donald Trump certainly has his steak 
today.

53
00:02:45,461 --> 00:02:46,294
It was my great honor to sign the 
largest tax cuts and reform in the 

54
00:02:49,511 --> 00:02:50,344
history of our country.
So according to the president and also 

55
00:02:52,570 --> 00:02:53,403
many Republican Party politicians,
Americans are facing a great fiscal 

56
00:02:56,261 --> 00:02:59,080
revolution.
A revolution that could make even Ronald

57
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:00,420
Reagan's cuts look pretty tiny

58
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,100
is this is the biggest tax cuts and 
reform in the history of our country.

59
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:08,040
This is bigger than actually president 
Reagan's.

60
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:08,850
How

61
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,120
ever dear viewer,
before you launch your celebration,

62
00:03:12,121 --> 00:03:12,954
please do wait a minute because we 
already know that donald isn't 

63
00:03:15,301 --> 00:03:18,270
particularly fond of the truth and well,
you know what?

64
00:03:18,271 --> 00:03:20,400
While this time it's really not any 
different.

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,670
Yes,

66
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:26,503
sadly that is right.
This fiscal reform isn't the largest in 

67
00:03:28,521 --> 00:03:29,990
US history.
Indeed not at all.

68
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:31,650
In fact,
it's not even among the top five.

69
00:03:33,050 --> 00:03:33,883
Allow me to explain,
even though we can say that Americans 

70
00:03:35,771 --> 00:03:38,200
are facing the biggest tax system reform
in 30 years,

71
00:03:38,201 --> 00:03:40,060
because this law does change a lot of 
things.

72
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:42,460
The truth is that when it comes to 
lowering taxes,

73
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:43,473
it's really not that impressive.
The general estimates is that this 

74
00:03:45,161 --> 00:03:45,994
reform,
we'll lower taxes between 0.7 and 0.9% 

75
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,343
of the GDP over the next 10 years.
That is approximately one point $5 

76
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:54,311
trillion.
Well,

77
00:03:54,311 --> 00:03:55,144
the fact is,
according to the committee for a 

78
00:03:56,231 --> 00:03:57,064
responsible federal budget and 
independent think tank and also 

79
00:03:59,051 --> 00:03:59,884
according to the u s treasury,
this is actually the eighth largest tax 

80
00:04:02,321 --> 00:04:06,820
reduction since 1918 indeed it is three 
times smaller than Reagan.

81
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:12,430
Yes,
indeed.

82
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,263
The problem here,
it may actually be the Donald Trump is 

83
00:04:14,771 --> 00:04:16,090
simply allergic to the trees,

84
00:04:18,710 --> 00:04:19,000
but anyway.

85
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:19,833
Nice.
What are the main points of this tax 

86
00:04:21,671 --> 00:04:23,410
reduction and what are its benefits?
Well.

87
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:28,440
Let's dive into those right now the 
reforms highlights,

88
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:38,600
even though there are a lot of changes,
there are really only two main points to

89
00:04:38,601 --> 00:04:40,910
consider here.
One is lowering income tax.

90
00:04:40,911 --> 00:04:43,250
That is to see the tax that affects 
natural persons,

91
00:04:43,251 --> 00:04:44,084
just regular man on the streets and the 
other is the changes to corporate tax 

92
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:51,530
first case,
but natural persons.

93
00:04:51,531 --> 00:04:53,690
This reduction is really,
really small.

94
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,583
C,
80% of taxpayers will see an income tax 

95
00:04:56,601 --> 00:05:00,170
change of less than 2% and most won't 
even really notice it.

96
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,980
And regarding this matter,
trump has blatantly broken his word.

97
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:06,690
So

98
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,261
why is this?
Well,

99
00:05:07,261 --> 00:05:08,094
because Donald Trump promised a new tax 
system a much simpler one with only 

100
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,300
three or four brackets and much lower,
right?

101
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:14,770
Yeah,

102
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:19,480
we're going to cut the individual rate 
from seven brackets

103
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:20,643
to form.

104
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:26,533
In the end,
things have virtually remained the same 

105
00:05:28,190 --> 00:05:31,310
with seven brackets kind of rates 
slightly lower than before.

106
00:05:31,370 --> 00:05:34,310
And that's not all this reduction.
It's also temporary.

107
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:35,173
Yeah,
that's right.

108
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:36,013
This is going to disappear in 2025 
unless Congress changes what it is 

109
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,890
approved.
By the way.

110
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,733
One very interesting thing about this 
law is that it limits deductions for 

111
00:05:46,401 --> 00:05:48,500
state and local taxes.
That is,

112
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:52,460
it punishes states with higher taxes and
encourages them to lower them.

113
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,353
Now on the other hands,
we have the reduction of corporate 

114
00:05:54,621 --> 00:05:56,450
income tax,
which is so to speak,

115
00:05:56,451 --> 00:05:57,950
the jewel,
the reform,

116
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:05,520
yeah.

117
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,353
The tax decreases from 35% to 21% and it
changes its scoped so that it ceases to 

118
00:06:10,771 --> 00:06:13,340
be global and to facts almost 
exclusively.

119
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:14,243
The United States allow me to explain 
myself because this is really important 

120
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:18,444
to up until now,
when American multinationals such as 

121
00:06:20,011 --> 00:06:23,160
apple or Google,
made money abroad as for example they do

122
00:06:23,161 --> 00:06:26,040
in Ireland,
despite having already paid taxes to the

123
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:26,874
Irish governments,
they had to pay again in the u s for 

124
00:06:29,101 --> 00:06:29,934
what they had earned in islands.
If they wanted to bring the money into 

125
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:32,844
the United States.
Essentially they were paying twice for 

126
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,690
any money they were bringing home.
Now,

127
00:06:36,691 --> 00:06:37,524
of course,
these companies weren't really very 

128
00:06:38,371 --> 00:06:39,204
willing to do that,
so you could probably guess what 

129
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,330
happened next.
Well these companies,

130
00:06:42,331 --> 00:06:43,164
they simply didn't repatriate their 
income to the United States as the 

131
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,910
cancer didn't.
Financial centers like Luxembourg,

132
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:51,210
Ireland or Singapore and the figures,
they're pretty dizzying.

133
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:55,140
We're talking about more than two point 
$5 trillion here.

134
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,200
Well,
the fact is that from now on,

135
00:07:00,201 --> 00:07:01,034
thanks to this reform,
US multinationals will only pay the u s 

136
00:07:03,351 --> 00:07:07,340
treasury for income they make within the
country and for the money that's already

137
00:07:07,341 --> 00:07:08,174
outside the new law states that they can
bring it home as a very attractive 

138
00:07:11,241 --> 00:07:12,860
conditions.
As an example,

139
00:07:12,861 --> 00:07:16,850
I have millions of dollars overseas.
I can't bring it back into this gun.

140
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,953
So indeed,
it's highly likely that this year we're 

141
00:07:19,251 --> 00:07:20,084
going to begin to see it.
Large amounts of money moving towards 

142
00:07:22,281 --> 00:07:23,240
the United States

143
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,810
away.
As a side note,

144
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,673
evenly,
the corporate income tax decreased from 

145
00:07:31,731 --> 00:07:35,570
35% 21% that isn't actually that big of 
a drop.

146
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,610
On the one hand,
while the tax rates do decrease,

147
00:07:37,611 --> 00:07:38,444
some deductions eliminated or limited,
and those deductions previously allowed 

148
00:07:42,171 --> 00:07:44,990
companies to pay an average of 20% 
before the reform.

149
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:48,140
On the other hand though,
the old US income tax was the highest in

150
00:07:48,141 --> 00:07:48,974
the OEC.
D If we take into account all the taxes 

151
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:51,614
companies pays not only on income.
The truth is that although the United 

152
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,040
States pays a lot of taxes,
Europe's are usually even higher.

153
00:07:58,070 --> 00:07:59,690
For example,
the ones in Spain,

154
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:01,040
France or even Janet.

155
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,890
I would even say even if it isn't as 
impressive as the republican state,

156
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:12,880
it will have positive consequences for 
the u s economy from now on the country.

157
00:08:12,881 --> 00:08:13,714
It will be more attractive to investors.
It's companies will earn more money and 

158
00:08:16,451 --> 00:08:18,640
a lot of income that was previously 
retained,

159
00:08:18,641 --> 00:08:19,474
a broad,
we'll begin to move to the United 

160
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,113
States,
so do you use all of this and due to 

161
00:08:24,281 --> 00:08:25,114
some other smaller changes,
just this once and certainly without 

162
00:08:28,061 --> 00:08:28,894
setting a precedence here at visual 
politic we can say trump seems to be 

163
00:08:31,541 --> 00:08:33,040
doing well in terms of tactics.

164
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:36,833
Awesome.

165
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,760
If you think that's it,
you are very,

166
00:08:38,761 --> 00:08:39,594
very wrong.
The reform also certainly has its 

167
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,000
negative points.

168
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:52,290
The shadows,
those

169
00:08:52,290 --> 00:08:53,400
who followed this channel?
No,

170
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:56,760
that we usually say that things aren't 
as pretty as they seem.

171
00:08:56,850 --> 00:09:00,090
Well that is precisely the case with 
this tax reform law.

172
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:01,043
On the one hand,
the positive effects of this log will 

173
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:06,030
most likely be much more limited than 
the Republican party claims.

174
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,990
And why is this?
Well,

175
00:09:06,991 --> 00:09:07,824
allow me to

176
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:09,493
you.

177
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:10,813
It's economy is growing at a good pace.
That is almost full employment and 

178
00:09:14,001 --> 00:09:14,834
corporate profits are historically high.
That is to say right now American 

179
00:09:20,121 --> 00:09:22,310
companies which are already very 
competitive,

180
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:23,173
mostly need fewer regulations,
the ability to trade freely and the 

181
00:09:25,671 --> 00:09:26,504
freedom to hire the workers they need,
including the best talents they can get 

182
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:30,523
from abroad.
Yeah.

183
00:09:34,610 --> 00:09:35,443
MMM.

184
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:39,590
As you probably know,
trump doesn't exactly play that way.

185
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:42,200
So yeah,
the reform will have positive effects,

186
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:43,034
but not as many as some people do.
Think while it is not the largest tax 

187
00:09:46,401 --> 00:09:47,234
cut ever,
it is the most poorly timed tax cut in 

188
00:09:48,801 --> 00:09:49,634
history.
The economy is near full employment and 

189
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:54,440
the national debt is it postwar record 
and rising fast.

190

Leonard Eberman Tax Policy Center,
cofounder and institute fellow at the 

191
00:09:59,570 --> 00:10:00,141
Urban Institute.
On the other hand,

192
00:10:00,141 --> 00:10:02,660
this government isn't talking about 
reducing public spending.

193
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,590
Indeed,
on the contrary,

194
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:06,920
they want to increase public spending on
infrastructure and the military,

195
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,690
and of course with fewer taxes.
This means more deficits and more public

196
00:10:11,691 --> 00:10:13,580
debt as well.
If we're honest,

197
00:10:13,640 --> 00:10:15,980
the U S has quite a track record of 
that.

198
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:23,583
And lastly,
develop deep forgotten party in this 

199
00:10:24,971 --> 00:10:26,590
reform is of course,
the middle class.

200
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,453
That's right.
The ones who will benefit the most from 

201
00:10:28,541 --> 00:10:30,850
this reform will be the wealthiest 
classes,

202
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,140
including,
of course,

203
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:33,340
Donald Trump himself

204
00:10:33,430 --> 00:10:37,180
in the center of the stage tonight.
There's this man Donald Trump.

205
00:10:40,390 --> 00:10:41,550
Am I allowed to accept it?

206
00:10:44,810 --> 00:10:47,720
Had Rich Friends of mine come up to me 
and say,

207
00:10:47,721 --> 00:10:49,880
Donald,
you're doing this tax plan.

208
00:10:50,210 --> 00:10:52,290
We don't want anything.
We don't

209
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,170
president.
Consider that he and his companies would

210
00:10:58,171 --> 00:11:00,510
benefit so well from this reform.
Well,

211
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:02,460
I'm going to leave that for you too.

212
00:11:02,650 --> 00:11:04,770
Sit Up.
The Republican Party

213
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:05,603
has betrayed working families.
This tax scam takes billions of dollars 

214
00:11:08,431 --> 00:11:11,760
away from the middleclass,
enhance it over to Republican donors and

215
00:11:11,761 --> 00:11:15,540
wealthy corporations while mortgaging 
away the future of our economy by adding

216
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:18,180
one point $5 trillion in debt.
Tom Perez,

217
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,190
chairman of the Democratic National 
Committee.

218
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:21,053
Maybe this is why Paul stayed,
that most Americans do not really like 

219
00:11:23,761 --> 00:11:24,594
this change.
The general perception that seems to be 

220
00:11:26,251 --> 00:11:29,370
that this reform,
it was made by and forth the richest.

221
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,190
In fact,
unlike what we might expect,

222
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:32,043
many Democratic Party leaders are 
rubbing their hands together and 

223
00:11:34,141 --> 00:11:36,810
thinking that this may favor them in the
mid term elections,

224
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:39,990
which will be held in November.
Only time it's going to tell.

225
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:40,883
But what we think is that this reform 
will make us companies more attractive 

226
00:11:43,591 --> 00:11:45,990
and that's in principle is a very good 
thing.

227
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,250
Of course,
as things are,

228
00:11:47,251 --> 00:11:50,820
the US needs many more measures which 
trump has ruled out.

229
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,683
But on the other hand,
there may be time for the United States 

230
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:57,190
to begin taking their public debts 
terrifying growth much more seriously.

231
00:11:57,210 --> 00:11:59,000
And by the way,
just as a final note yet,

232
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:01,170
with this reform,
we all kind of win in away.

233
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,790
You see,
if the United States reduces its taxes,

234
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:04,653
it's also been shown historically that 
other governments will be unwilling to 

235
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:08,000
raise.

236
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:08,833
That's,

237
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,830
but for now,
it's your turn.

238
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:14,840
Are you in favor of this tax reform?
Well,

Friends at the reconsider media 
podcasts,

245
00:12:29,270 --> 00:12:31,400
they provided the vocals in this 
episode,

246
00:12:31,401 --> 00:12:32,780
but we're not mine.
And as always,

247
00:12:33,530 --> 00:12:34,363
thank you for watching.

As an example,
I have millions of dollars overseas.

249
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,370
I can't bring it back into this skunk.
Am I allowed to accept tips?

250
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:44,580
I've had rich friends of mine come up to
me and say,

251
00:12:44,581 --> 00:12:46,710
Donald,
you're doing this tax plan.

252
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,230
We don't want anything.
We don't.
