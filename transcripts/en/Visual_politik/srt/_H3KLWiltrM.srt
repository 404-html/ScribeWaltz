1
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:15,513
Okay.

2
00:00:20,630 --> 00:00:21,463
April,
2015 a historic meeting took place 

3
00:00:23,601 --> 00:00:26,090
between Raul Castro,
the president of Cuba,

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:27,260
and Barack Obama.

5
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:34,710
It was celebrated in Panama and it was 
the first and bilateral meeting of the U

6
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:37,620
S and Cuban and presidents in 50 years,
four months,

7
00:00:37,621 --> 00:00:38,454
Ellia booth leaders and announced they 
would remake relations between the two 

8
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,360
governments.
Today,

9
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:43,433
the United States of America is changing
its relationship with the people of 

10
00:00:46,141 --> 00:00:47,030
Cuba.
I'm dust.

11
00:00:47,060 --> 00:00:50,130
They said they would do.
So it was done in just a short period of

12
00:00:50,131 --> 00:00:54,060
time that he first changes were made and
relations between both countries started

13
00:00:54,061 --> 00:00:54,894
to returns and normal.
Now he goes same like we see this a lot 

14
00:00:57,541 --> 00:00:58,374
on this channel,
but the arrival of Donald Trump to the 

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:01,590
White House,
well,

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:05,860
they changed everything again,
the new presidents of the United States,

17
00:01:05,861 --> 00:01:06,694
there's ordered that the u s steps back 
from most of the changes that Obama 

18
00:01:09,781 --> 00:01:13,050
initiated with Cuba.
So the question might be,

19
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,943
why is he doing this?
What does he expect and what are the 

20
00:01:16,621 --> 00:01:17,454
consequences of this new policy?
We're going to look at all of these 

21
00:01:19,981 --> 00:01:21,870
questions in this video,
but before we do,

22
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,733
let's have a quick little caps.
The history of the relations between 

23
00:01:24,811 --> 00:01:26,010
these two countries.

24
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,010
Okay.

25
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:30,850
The embargo,

26
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:32,600
often

27
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,470
the so called Cuban revolution took 
place against a Batista's dictatorship.

28
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,333
The new governments in the islands led 
by Fidel Castro soon started to 

29
00:01:40,281 --> 00:01:44,030
nationalize every kind of capital good 
and company Landon's,

30
00:01:44,031 --> 00:01:45,230
hotels,
factories.

31
00:01:45,231 --> 00:01:46,064
Well,
everything was up for grabs by the 

32
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:51,410
governments.
So the Cuban revolution ended on the 1st

33
00:01:51,410 --> 00:01:53,000
of January,
1959 and already buying may,

34
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:57,230
the government had begun a huge 
expropriations all across the country.

35
00:01:57,290 --> 00:01:58,123
Now our eyes,
you might probably be able to imagine 

36
00:01:59,571 --> 00:02:03,350
this is something that the u s did not 
really take very well.

37
00:02:03,470 --> 00:02:04,303
There were thousands of lawsuits filed 
in the u s which had close relations 

38
00:02:07,491 --> 00:02:09,340
with Cuba at the time.
Further,

39
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,213
if this wasn't enough to upset the u s 
the Soviet Union was already getting on 

40
00:02:13,941 --> 00:02:15,670
well with Fidel Castro

41
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,710
at this moment,
when as a penalty,

42
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:20,603
Washington passed the first trade 
embargo against the island and in 

43
00:02:23,410 --> 00:02:24,243
embargo.
That's slowly grew stronger as the 

44
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:29,010
relations between these countries were 
getting worse.

45
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:30,400
Okay.

46
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,380
Backed off to the missile crisis of 1962
at Kennedy,

47
00:02:33,381 --> 00:02:36,110
even limited to us,
traveled to Cuba since then.

48
00:02:36,111 --> 00:02:36,944
Then with the exception of short periods
of battery relations under the 

49
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:39,944
governments of Ford and Carter,
the various governments of the United 

50
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,700
States of cabs of the embargo and the 
policy of isolating Cuba economically,

51
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:50,230
we'll move Reagan.
Reagan

52
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,093
labeled the island as a sponsor of 
terrorism and later Bill Clinton made 

53
00:02:54,341 --> 00:02:57,850
even more severe restrictions and the 
embargo was put into law.

54
00:02:57,910 --> 00:02:58,743
Since then,
traveling to and investing in Cuba or 

55
00:03:00,521 --> 00:03:04,440
doing business with the Cuban government
has been very limited for America.

56
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:07,710
Wow.

57
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,770
That is until Barack Obama came to 
office

58
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:18,010
story 2008 fidel past power to his 
brother Raul Castro.

59
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:19,023
That same year elections took place and 
Obama said it was time to use a 

60
00:03:22,151 --> 00:03:22,984
different approach with Cuba.
It was time to improve diplomatic 

61
00:03:25,691 --> 00:03:27,160
relations between the two countries.

62
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:32,670
Obama didn't want to wait and shortly 
after he arrived in the White House,

63
00:03:32,671 --> 00:03:35,700
he softens some of the restrictions that
were in place on Cuba.

64
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:38,250
For example,
he allowed Cubans in the u s to send the

65
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:42,330
money to the islands and he started to 
allow US citizens do travel to Cuba.

66
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,610
Many more things followed these fast 
gestures.

67
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:45,473
During the years,
Obama was in office many restrictions 

68
00:03:47,281 --> 00:03:48,120
against Cuba.

69
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:49,463
Yes.

70
00:03:53,020 --> 00:03:56,830
December of that year,
Raul Castro and Obama met in Panama.

71
00:03:56,860 --> 00:03:58,840
Significant progress was being made.

72
00:03:58,920 --> 00:03:59,753
Well,
I think what we have both concluded is 

73
00:04:01,771 --> 00:04:04,020
that we can disagree,
uh,

74
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:09,170
with a spirit of respect and civility 
and that over time it is possible for us

75
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:17,610
to turn the page and develop a new 
relationship between our two countries.

76
00:04:18,050 --> 00:04:18,883
Anne's,
that is how to greater moments took 

77
00:04:20,511 --> 00:04:21,344
place in 2015 the embassy's reopens in 
both countries and in March of 2016 Air 

78
00:04:26,421 --> 00:04:28,880
Force One lands then Havana for the 
first time in history,

79
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:38,730
Cuba,

80
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,563
I dunno,
hosted a sitting American presidents 

81
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:42,270
since 1920 [inaudible].

82
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,403
Okay.

83
00:04:44,770 --> 00:04:45,603
See of isolation designed for the Cold 
War made little sense in the 21st 

84
00:04:48,471 --> 00:04:49,304
century.
The embargo was only hurting the Cuban 

85
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,110
people.
Instead of helping them,

86
00:04:52,730 --> 00:04:53,563
it's time to lift the embargo.
It is time now for us to leave the past 

87
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:00,560
behind.
It is time for us to look forward to the

88
00:05:00,561 --> 00:05:02,760
future together.
When for Turo,

89
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:03,923
they Esperanza

90
00:05:04,810 --> 00:05:05,643
policies towards Cuba.
We're taking over and even though the 

91
00:05:08,081 --> 00:05:10,660
embargo laws were technically still 
enforced,

92
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:11,523
the Obama administration managed to find
legal loopholes to allow the relations 

93
00:05:14,771 --> 00:05:17,800
between these two countries to be 
something close to normal.

94
00:05:17,830 --> 00:05:18,663
When Obama left the White House,
Americans could travel freely to Cuban 

95
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:21,813
immigrants,
could send unlimited money back to the 

96
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:24,154
country.
American companies could invest in Cuba 

97
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:26,853
and even planes of American companies 
frequently landed at Jose Marti 

98
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,780
international airports because the new 
relationship,

99
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,250
well,
it was working,

100
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,730
but then Donald Trump became president 
all over the United States.

101
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:40,270
And as we already mentioned,
everything changed

102
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:47,580
grump and Cuba.

103
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:50,703
On the 16th of June,
2017 trump decided to take this new 

104
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,603
policy back and he did so in a 
neighborhood of Miami called Little 

105
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,053
Havana effective.
Immediately I am canceling the last 

106
00:06:01,101 --> 00:06:04,340
administration's completely one sided 
deal with Cuba.

107
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,273
As soon as he finished his speech,
trump signed guidelines for his so 

108
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:08,534
called new policy with Cuba.
But it's after any 50 year embargo with 

109
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:15,050
the country etiquette hardly be 
described as actually being new,

110
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:20,000
won't completely reverse Obama's 
policies.

111
00:06:20,001 --> 00:06:21,890
Many will be maintained,
for example,

112
00:06:21,950 --> 00:06:22,783
the opening of embassies and the 
commercial flights between the two 

113
00:06:25,161 --> 00:06:25,994
countries.

114
00:06:26,810 --> 00:06:29,530
However,
from now on trips of Americans to Cuba,

115
00:06:29,531 --> 00:06:30,460
we'll,
we'll be limited does it,

116
00:06:30,461 --> 00:06:31,294
they won't be able to go individually 
and any relationship with gay Sunday 

117
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,350
holding grahib directed by the 
governments,

118
00:06:36,351 --> 00:06:40,250
which controls more than 50% of the 
Cuban economy will be forbidden.

119
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,113
But don't think that trump has always 
had this hard line attitude towards 

120
00:06:44,241 --> 00:06:45,500
Cuba.
Quite the opposite.

121
00:06:45,501 --> 00:06:48,800
In fact,
in 1998 he tried to build a hotel on the

122
00:06:48,801 --> 00:06:49,634
islands contradicting the embargo and 
did the beginning of 2016 he supported 

123
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:55,550
Obama's new policies towards the 
country.

124
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,443
But here revision policy,
we think that trump's out attitude 

125
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,700
towards Cuba.
Well,

126
00:06:58,701 --> 00:07:02,060
it can be a mistake.
So let's have a look at exactly why

127
00:07:06,890 --> 00:07:07,880
trump's mistake.

128
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:11,650
Let's make one thing really clear right 
now.

129
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:14,830
The embargo against Cuba has been eight 
total failure.

130
00:07:14,970 --> 00:07:15,803
Yeah.

131
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:17,143
US embargo,
which is blocked all trade and 

132
00:07:19,331 --> 00:07:22,780
investment with Cuba for the past 55 
years has not worked.

133
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:23,673
It is failed to isolate.
The Cuban government failed to regain 

134
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:26,523
any nationalized property and succeeded 
in giving an excuse to the Castro 

135
00:07:29,471 --> 00:07:31,900
government for its abuses and economic 
mismanaged

136
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:36,740
more than 50 years.
The embargo has been completely useless.

137
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:37,603
It hasn't accomplished anything,
and on top of that to the Cuban 

138
00:07:39,801 --> 00:07:44,300
government has used it as an excuse to 
justify their poor economic situation.

139
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,750
Wait just a second here because this is 
not the end of it.

140
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:48,703
Not even close.
Reversing Obama's policies is a mistake 

141
00:07:51,381 --> 00:07:53,510
for several reasons.
Importantly,

142
00:07:53,511 --> 00:07:54,344
improved relations with the u s of 
Menton better security for the United 

143
00:07:58,130 --> 00:07:58,963
States.
Obama signed several important 

144
00:07:59,811 --> 00:08:04,400
cooperation agreements and since 2015 
given authorities have given information

145
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,520
on drug and human trafficking to the u s
and it's,

146
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,354
on the other hand,
Russia and China have also set their 

147
00:08:10,071 --> 00:08:10,940
eyes on the island.

148
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:11,813
The game.

149
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,570
Russia says it may reopen Soviet era,
military bases,

150
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:17,523
Cuba

151
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:19,883
probably.
Imagine what a belief in national 

152
00:08:20,731 --> 00:08:23,610
security of the United States this would
be.

153
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,473
This is why making relations more 
difficult means nothing more than 

154
00:08:27,751 --> 00:08:32,310
forcing the Cuban government to seek 
better relations with Moscow or Beijing.

155
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:37,370
Not exactly a brilliant option for the u
s and there is so much more.

156
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:42,510
Trump's new policy will only damage to 
the interests of many American companies

157
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,373
as well as put at risk,
the major changes that are taking place 

158
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:47,130
on the islands.

159
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,020
How is Cuba changing

160
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:53,700
fins?
Raul Castro came to power.

161
00:08:53,701 --> 00:08:54,534
He has admitted that Cuban a change of 
direction and that the Cuban model 

162
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:00,390
simply is not working.
Some people were saying that he wants to

163
00:09:00,391 --> 00:09:01,224
emulate China,
be open to the world that maintain 

164
00:09:03,421 --> 00:09:04,254
control.
The truth is that up until now changes 

165
00:09:06,721 --> 00:09:09,390
have been scarce and slow,
but even so,

166
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:10,253
these changes could be felt and now the 
Venezuela can no longer help the 

167
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:13,974
islands.
These changes have become more and more 

168
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,063
urgent.
So now let's have a look at what's been 

169
00:09:18,301 --> 00:09:21,420
happening since 2011 when reforms took 
place.

170
00:09:21,421 --> 00:09:22,254
Sims freelance entrepreneurship was made
a lot easier since 2011 the number of 

171
00:09:27,601 --> 00:09:30,630
self employed workers in Cuba is four 
times larger.

172
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:31,464
It's Dave.
The number exceeds half a million 

173
00:09:32,551 --> 00:09:33,384
workers.
The government has also allowed private 

174
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:37,830
farming for small farmers and 
restaurants and small tourism businesses

175
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:40,140
growing and spreading across the 
country.

176
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,410
The bottom is openness.
Well,

177
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:46,350
it certainly helps this process.
For example,

178
00:09:46,351 --> 00:09:47,184
almost all private businesses in Cuba 
are working off money coming in from 

179
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:50,964
abroad.
Abby and b already has 22,000 

180
00:09:52,791 --> 00:09:55,680
apartments,
homes or rooms available in Cuba.

181
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:56,543
Further,
we shouldn't forget about less tangible 

182
00:09:58,171 --> 00:10:01,050
things like the exchange of ideas,
mutual knowledge,

183
00:10:01,051 --> 00:10:03,600
and the strengthening of the private 
sector.

184
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:07,590
Every dollar left in the hands of cab 
drivers,

185
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:10,020
hotel workers,
waitresses and valleys.

186
00:10:10,110 --> 00:10:13,290
It's a show of what awaits Cubans if 
they reject socialism,

187
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,060
US Senator Rand Paul,

188
00:10:15,470 --> 00:10:19,460
take a look at China and compare the 
country as it is today to the country.

189
00:10:19,461 --> 00:10:23,330
It was during Mao's time since the 
country opened itself up to the wells.

190
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:26,750
Hundreds of millions of people have left
poverty behinds.

191
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:28,220
Yes,
China like Cuba,

192
00:10:28,221 --> 00:10:29,054
it's still a terrible dictatorship is 
thanks to that open policy the Chinese 

193
00:10:32,661 --> 00:10:36,980
have today more freedom as a better 
standard of living than they've ever had

194
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,873
before.
The short of the matter is that the 

195
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,234
embargo policy,
while it's fails and trump's insistence 

196
00:10:47,181 --> 00:10:48,014
in going back to this,
is North's going to achieve anything 

197
00:10:49,761 --> 00:10:53,870
that the weakening of security in the 
United States lead to further poverty in

198
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:57,080
Cuba and prevent the changes that are 
happening on the islands.

199
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:00,140
In February of 2018 at Castro was going 
to leave power,

200
00:11:00,170 --> 00:11:03,370
and this is not the moment for the u s 
to take a step

201
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:07,150
that's in order to

202
00:11:07,390 --> 00:11:08,223
define his decision.
And trump says he wants to defend human 

203
00:11:09,941 --> 00:11:11,620
rights,
which is nice.

204
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:12,783
Don't you think it's a bit hypocritical 
to defend the Cuba's embargo while at 

205
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,160
the same time he hugs the leaders of 
Saudi Arabia?

206
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:20,110
I mean a human rights not important,

207
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:24,200
less important.

208
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:28,360
10 Republicans have also criticized this
course changed with Cuba

209
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:33,000
policy change that diminishes the 
ability of Americans to travel freely to

210
00:11:33,001 --> 00:11:38,001
Cuba is not in the best interests of the
United States or the Cuban people.

211
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:39,900
US Senator Jeff Flake.

212
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,510
Now we'd really love to know what you 
think.
