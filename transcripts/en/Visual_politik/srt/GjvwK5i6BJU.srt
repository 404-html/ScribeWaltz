1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:05,110
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,353
on July the first 1997 after 155 years 
of British software and see Hong Kong 

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:14,693
returned to China.
It did so as a special administrative 

4
00:00:17,401 --> 00:00:20,550
region under the one country two systems
model.

5
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:21,453
A model whose goal was to ensure that 
Hong Kong would continue being Hong 

6
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,433
Kong,
the freest city on the entire Asian 

7
00:00:27,391 --> 00:00:28,224
continent.
That means that thanks to this 

8
00:00:29,221 --> 00:00:31,860
particular political model,
Hong Kong has its own laws,

9
00:00:31,861 --> 00:00:34,440
its own justice system,
its own police force,

10
00:00:34,441 --> 00:00:35,274
its own currency and even has its own 
customs and immigration policy that is 

11
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:39,623
very different from the rest of China.
So in the day to day operations of Hong 

12
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:44,483
Kong it will,
it's pretty much as an independent 

13
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:47,064
country and well it's going to remain 
that way until at least the year 2047 

14
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:51,923
maybe that's why he's,
since Hong Kong passed into Chinese 

15
00:00:53,611 --> 00:00:58,611
hands that things have gone pretty well 
in the city over the past 20 years.

16
00:00:59,581 --> 00:01:02,460
Hong Kong's economy has grown by an 
average of 3.3%

17
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:02,670
pay.

18
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:03,503
Yeah.
More than 1 million people have moved 

19
00:01:04,711 --> 00:01:05,544
from mainland China to this territory in
search of fortune and the city is still 

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,610
an oasis of freedom.
Yes,

21
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,553
the influence and the interference of 
the Chinese government's in local 

22
00:01:16,231 --> 00:01:19,410
politics has grown a lot in recent 
years.

23
00:01:19,411 --> 00:01:20,244
Now here on visual politic,
we already talked about this for 

24
00:01:22,531 --> 00:01:23,364
example,
then past videos we discussed the 

25
00:01:25,291 --> 00:01:26,124
umbrella revolution and Beijing's 
growing interference in local politics 

26
00:01:29,431 --> 00:01:30,810
swells the viewer.
In the video.

27
00:01:30,811 --> 00:01:34,230
Today we're going to talk about another 
standout feature of this place.

28
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,093
I mean,
did you know that Hong Kong is the city 

29
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:40,860
with some of the most expensive and also
the smallest houses in the world?

30
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,890
Well,
listen up a rising market,

31
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,800
seven and a half million inhabitants and
more than 1,200

32
00:01:55,801 --> 00:01:56,634
skyscrapers,
homes and Hong Kong are terribly 

33
00:01:58,651 --> 00:02:00,980
expensive and it's not just homes,
garages,

34
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:01,823
officers,
and anything else that has to do with 

35
00:02:03,241 --> 00:02:05,940
the real estate sector is incredibly 
expensive.

36
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:09,270
So much so that we can find news like 
this.

37
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:13,680
Hong Kong parking spots sold for record,
600,000

38
00:02:13,681 --> 00:02:15,020
US dollars.
All right,

39
00:02:15,021 --> 00:02:15,854
so let's assume that you have $1 million
and you wanted to buy apartments in one 

40
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:22,500
of the cities in nicer areas.
Well,

41
00:02:22,501 --> 00:02:23,334
in that case,
you'd barely be able to afford a 22 

42
00:02:25,021 --> 00:02:25,854
square meters or 236 square feet,
and that's for $1 million when 

43
00:02:29,671 --> 00:02:30,504
considering cities with the most 
expensive premium homes in the world's 

44
00:02:33,331 --> 00:02:36,380
Pong Kong places.
Second only behind Monaco,

45
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:40,860
Alibaba,
chief biases own Aladdin's cave jack mob

46
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:41,694
purchases.
Hong Kong's most expensive home for 193 

47
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:47,220
million US dollars.
But of course if we take into account,

48
00:02:47,221 --> 00:02:48,054
but all kinds of people live in Hong 
Kong and skip and Monica is very 

49
00:02:50,251 --> 00:02:51,084
particular case.
Hong Kong is by far the city with the 

50
00:02:53,461 --> 00:02:55,710
most expensive homes in the wells.

51
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,010
It's giving you an

52
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,843
idea.
Since 2003 the price of housing in Hong 

53
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:04,143
Kong has risen by 450% and today the 
average price per square meter exceeds 

54
00:03:09,820 --> 00:03:14,350
$16,000
that's the equivalence of $1,486

55
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,470
per square foot.
Yup.

56
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:18,940
That means that if you want to buy a 
normal 90 square meter house,

57
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,803
nothing particularly fancy,
you have to pay at the very least one 

58
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,840
point $5 million,
which is quite the mortgage.

59
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,150
Now,
it's very common to compare which cities

60
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,984
are more or less accessible by counting 
how many years of average wages before 

61
00:03:32,681 --> 00:03:35,680
taxes we need to buy an average home.
Well,

62
00:03:35,681 --> 00:03:40,681
so let's have a look at Hong Kong.
According to the latest data,

63
00:03:41,111 --> 00:03:41,944
in order to buy a house in Hong Kong,
you'd need more than 18 years of full 

64
00:03:45,881 --> 00:03:49,360
wages for comparison in cities like 
Tokyo or Singapore,

65
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:54,280
one needs less than five years of wages.
In other words,

66
00:03:54,310 --> 00:03:58,240
Hong Kong's situation is totally crazy 
and not only that,

67
00:03:58,270 --> 00:04:01,020
since prosperity is so expensive and 
inaccessible,

68
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:01,883
the Hong Kong zone citizens,
they've had to buy smaller and smaller 

69
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:05,050
homes.

70
00:04:05,050 --> 00:04:08,080
And speaking of small homes,
could you guess what the average surface

71
00:04:08,081 --> 00:04:10,930
area for a home in Hong Kong,
it's,

72
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,400
what would you guess a hundred square 
meters,

73
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,000
80 60 well,
all of those figures are sky high.

74
00:04:16,030 --> 00:04:20,920
The reality is that that's 42 square 
meters or 452 square feet.

75
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:23,410
Can you imagine living in a house that 
small?

76
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,580
Well,
in that case,

77
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:25,473
check out the latest trends.
Hong Kong is so expensive that 

78
00:04:28,751 --> 00:04:33,460
architects are building a hundred square
foot tube homes made from concrete water

79
00:04:33,461 --> 00:04:34,330
pipes,
ra,

80
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:36,580
ra.
So some of you might now be thinking,

81
00:04:36,581 --> 00:04:37,301
well wow,
Simon,

82
00:04:37,301 --> 00:04:38,134
that's really small,
but I'm pretty sure that's because 

83
00:04:40,271 --> 00:04:43,930
people live alone in tiny apartments,
which alters the statistics,

84
00:04:43,960 --> 00:04:45,100
right?
Well,

85
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,600
no.
On average,

86
00:04:46,601 --> 00:04:51,601
almost three people live in a 42 square 
meter or 425 square feet apartments,

87
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,350
which is pretty darn insane.
And it's not only the homes.

88
00:04:56,351 --> 00:04:57,880
The same thing happens with officers.

89
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,360
Awesome.

90
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,820
Him skyscrapers sells for record of 5.2
billion US dollars.

91
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:13,080
But of course,
having said that,

92
00:05:13,081 --> 00:05:14,640
you might now be wondering,
well,

93
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:17,850
why the Hell Oh homes so expensive in 
Hong Kong?

94
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,960
Well,
listen up.

95
00:05:27,470 --> 00:05:29,270
The lack of land,
a myth,

96
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:32,213
massive skyscrapers,
tiny end ludicrously expensive 

97
00:05:34,561 --> 00:05:35,394
apartments.
This is how we could pretty much 

98
00:05:37,081 --> 00:05:39,060
describe Hong Kong.
Don't you agree?

99
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:39,781
I mean,
after all,

100
00:05:39,781 --> 00:05:43,980
we're talking about one of the most 
densely populated places in the world.

101
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:49,050
All right,
so many people very,

102
00:05:49,051 --> 00:05:52,710
this'll space pretty much a perfect 
combination for super high prices.

103
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:53,573
Right?
Well,

104
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,160
hold on just a moment because,
well,

105
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:57,563
this is not the whole truth.
The truth is that less than 25% of that 

106
00:06:02,861 --> 00:06:03,694
is a quarter of Hong Kong's territory is
urbanized and only 7% of the entire 

107
00:06:07,661 --> 00:06:11,650
territory is occupied by urban housing 
outside the crowded areas,

108
00:06:11,651 --> 00:06:13,330
we find countryside,
jungle,

109
00:06:13,331 --> 00:06:14,910
old villages,
golf courses,

110
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,560
and many,
many single family homes.

111
00:06:20,890 --> 00:06:21,110
Oh,

112
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:22,740
alrighty.
Then so well,

113
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,160
how is this possible?
Why don't you see it?

114
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:26,003
For years,
Hong Kong was considered to be the 

115
00:06:27,331 --> 00:06:28,164
freest economy in the entire world 
according to the index of economic 

116
00:06:32,071 --> 00:06:32,904
freedom.
We're talking about a place with low 

117
00:06:33,781 --> 00:06:35,010
taxes,
free trade,

118
00:06:35,011 --> 00:06:38,910
legal security as a very small amounts 
of government intervention.

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,060
Yup.
Hong Kong is a highly capitalist city.

120
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,230
That's why it's the third largest 
financial center in the world after only

121
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:48,060
London and New York,
by the way,

122
00:06:48,061 --> 00:06:49,560
fun fact here.
The Basic Law.

123
00:06:49,561 --> 00:06:50,394
Hong Kong's constitution limits the 
government so that it can't spend more 

124
00:06:53,341 --> 00:06:54,174
than it makes.
This means that the government usually 

125
00:06:55,831 --> 00:06:58,410
closes every year with a surplus.
Indeed,

126
00:06:58,411 --> 00:06:59,244
this has led it to save so much surplus 
that it has over $220 billion in 

127
00:07:03,991 --> 00:07:04,830
reserve.
Yeah.

128
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,080
Unlike many,
many other countries around the world,

129
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:09,690
Hong Kong does not have public debt.
All right,

130
00:07:09,691 --> 00:07:12,060
but fun facts assigned,
let us continue.

131
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:12,983
The fact is that despite so much freedom
and so much commitment to capitalism as 

132
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:17,514
a sector in which the government has 
intervenes a lot and I am betting 

133
00:07:21,331 --> 00:07:22,164
because you've been watching this video 
for some time now that you can probably 

134
00:07:24,211 --> 00:07:27,510
guess what that is.
Yes,

135
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:28,373
it is the real estate sector.
You see the government owns practically 

136
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,090
all of the lands in Hong Kong.

137
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,970
Governments.
Authorities control how much land is put

138
00:07:39,971 --> 00:07:40,804
on the market and when it can be built 
upon and of course if the development 

139
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:44,764
bureau decides what Cam and what cannot 
be built now generally lands 

140
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:50,680
concessions.
They're given through auctions.

141
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:54,610
These are generally for private homes,
offices or commercial uses.

142
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,473
All.
They are done directly through 

143
00:07:55,961 --> 00:07:56,794
agreements with developers when public 
housing with lower rental prices is 

144
00:07:59,621 --> 00:08:00,454
going to be built,
which is where a large part of Hong 

145
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:03,903
Kong's population live

146
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:09,103
and it's normal even in auctions for the
property to continue being government 

147
00:08:12,771 --> 00:08:17,570
property as they are granted a right of 
use for an unspecified number of years.

148
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:18,463
So sure homes being so expensive in Hong
Kong has a lot to do with scarcity but 

149
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:25,070
it's not due to eight geographical 
shortage.

150
00:08:25,130 --> 00:08:28,040
It's due to governmental decision 
making.

151
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:34,730
There's plenty of land to develop new 
residential and office areas and there's

152
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,430
always the option of gaining ground at 
sea.

153
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,211
Yes,
in Hong Kong,

154
00:08:38,211 --> 00:08:40,940
reclaiming land from the sea is not a 
strange thing to do.

155
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:41,774
Indeed a quarter of all the built up 
areas of Hong Kong are on land that was 

156
00:08:44,781 --> 00:08:46,970
reclaimed from the seat,
but the government,

157
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:52,060
they decide absolutely everything.
The shortage of land is a myth.

158
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:53,683
There are over 200 hectares of land 
available for building in the urban 

159
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:58,860
areas.
The shortage of housing is real,

160
00:08:58,861 --> 00:08:59,694
but that is because of deliberate 
manipulation of the market by the 

161
00:09:02,371 --> 00:09:03,204
government.
John Right Barrister and chairman of 

162
00:09:05,161 --> 00:09:06,980
Friends of cycle.
Well,

163
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:09,090
in recent decades,
as we mentioned before,

164
00:09:09,091 --> 00:09:09,924
Hong Kong's population has grown a lot 
because many people have come in from 

165
00:09:12,511 --> 00:09:13,620
China.
In addition,

166
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:17,880
family size has decreased and many 
Chinese investors want to invest in this

167
00:09:17,881 --> 00:09:20,130
city,
which is known for its legal security.

168
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,813
Hello,

169
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,500
this has led to a rise in demands.
Burton not supply.

170
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,250
This is simply because the government 
doesn't want to do it.

171
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,570
Palm prices will continue to grow due to
limited supply.

172
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:37,570
Thomas Lamb,
senior director at night to frank.

173
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,690
Well now the question has to be,
well,

174
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,533
why is the government interested in 
restricting supply and increasing 

175
00:09:43,421 --> 00:09:44,620
prices?
Well,

176
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:45,483
there are at least two reasons.
The first is that auctions are a great 

177
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:52,120
business for the public pass.
In 2017 for example,

178
00:09:52,121 --> 00:09:52,954
one out of every $5 from public revenues
came from the sale of lands and we're 

179
00:09:56,501 --> 00:10:01,501
talking here about $15 billion.
The second reason,

180
00:10:02,051 --> 00:10:02,884
which is much more sinister is that 
there are suspicions of not very clean 

181
00:10:06,791 --> 00:10:09,820
relations between the authorities and 
large promoters,

182
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,713
and in some cases,
these suspicions have led to 

183
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:17,310
convictions.
Calm property magnate,

184
00:10:17,311 --> 00:10:20,070
Thomas Kwok back in jail for bribing 
cities.

185
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:20,933
Number two official,
you see the real estate sector in Hong 

186
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:24,083
Kong is held in very few hands,
hands that belonged do 

187
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,920
multibillionaires.
In fact,

188
00:10:28,921 --> 00:10:33,600
17 of the 14 biggest estate magnates in 
Asia are from this city.

189
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,273
Okay.

190
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,453
And well these big businessmen preferred
to keep prices sky high and avoid 

191
00:10:44,271 --> 00:10:45,104
competition.
It's something that happens when the 

192
00:10:46,251 --> 00:10:47,084
government brings various Atlanta market
and see in addition increases any new 

193
00:10:50,511 --> 00:10:52,220
projects,
bureaucracy that way.

194
00:10:52,221 --> 00:10:53,054
Small and medium sized enterprises,
contents of the market and foreign 

195
00:10:55,521 --> 00:10:59,690
companies simply don't dare to because 
that have a clear disadvantage.

196
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:02,090
And of course if you are,
as you might imagine,

197
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:04,790
all of this has pretty severe 
consequences.

198
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:14,393
The consequences,
the crazy price of housing has meant 

199
00:11:18,781 --> 00:11:21,750
that despite having a lot of employments
in high wages,

200
00:11:21,751 --> 00:11:22,584
many people live in difficult conditions
like families having to live in 40 

201
00:11:25,561 --> 00:11:26,394
square meters,
that's 431 square feet homes while 

202
00:11:28,841 --> 00:11:30,380
paying exorbitant Morgan.

203
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:32,380
This is

204
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,213
system has also led many people,
especially the youngest ones do depends 

205
00:11:36,611 --> 00:11:39,610
on the government's public housing.
And as you might imagine,

206
00:11:39,611 --> 00:11:40,444
these are particularly small and do 
remember that in Hong Kong there's no 

207
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:44,404
chance of living on the outskirts or in 
remote areas because that would mean 

208
00:11:47,381 --> 00:11:48,214
crossing over to mainland China and 
losing all of the freedoms that people 

209
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:56,700
have in this city as if that was not 
enough.

210
00:11:56,771 --> 00:11:57,604
The high price of officers and business 
buildings has caused many companies and 

211
00:12:00,311 --> 00:12:01,144
too many investments do you end up in 
other cities if the Powell river delta 

212
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:07,210
such Shenzhen,
which poses problems for the future,

213
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:12,610
but that is a whole of year that we 
could do another time.

214
00:12:12,611 --> 00:12:13,630
But anyway,
it's a viewer.

215
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:14,493
That's how things are in the city.
This until now has been one of the most 

216
00:12:17,471 --> 00:12:19,900
prominent beacons of prosperity and 
freedom in Asia.

217
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:24,250
Only the future is going to tell us 
whether this will continue to be,

218
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:25,210
and you know what?

219
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:27,910
We're going to be keeping a very close 
tie her official politic,

220
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:28,773
but now it's your turn.
Do you think that Hong Kong's 

221
00:12:30,191 --> 00:12:34,060
authorities should encourage growth by 
increasing the supply of real estate?

222
00:12:34,061 --> 00:12:34,894
