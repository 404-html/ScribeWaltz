1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,150
If you to invest your money in another 
country,

2
00:00:10,151 --> 00:00:13,690
I'm sure Venezuela wouldn't even be on 
the list.

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:16,240
Rice wells,
if you a government,

4
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:21,350
it does not agree with it.
China agrees to invest $20,

5
00:00:23,281 --> 00:00:27,300
million dollars in Venezuela to help 
offset effects of oil price slump.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:30,960
But hold on just a second because this 
is not only about China.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:31,883
Have you ever heard of Goldman Sachs?
It's one of those banks that symbolizes 

8
00:00:35,011 --> 00:00:37,770
American capitalism at its purest.
Well,

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:41,120
they too saw a lot of business 
opportunity as in Madeira.

10
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:41,993
Venezuela buys two point $8,000,000,000 
worth of Venezuelan bonds and an uproar 

11
00:00:49,501 --> 00:00:50,580
begins.
Yes,

12
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:51,443
you heard that right.
While Venezuela is having one of the 

13
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:55,860
worst economic catastrophes humanity has
ever witnessed,

14
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,460
they keep making deals with the world's 
biggest investors.

15
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:01,500
This is why,
despite the scarcity,

16
00:01:01,510 --> 00:01:04,200
the extreme poverty and the 
hyperinflation,

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,093
Nicolas Maduro is buying state of the 
art weapons do maintain an army that 

18
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,250
almost nobody could attack.
And Amit,

19
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:11,093
that has over 1000 rockets that were 
manufactured in Russia in October of 

20
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:16,380
this year.
That's 2017.

21
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:19,250
Madeira met Vladimir Putin to buy 
weapons.

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:20,393
Yes.

23
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:25,630
Meanwhile,
at Venezuela is also the biggest partner

24
00:01:25,631 --> 00:01:28,220
that China has in the region they ever 
received,

25
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,290
way more trainees money than any other 
Latin American country.

26
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,030
All right,
so now you might be wondering,

27
00:01:34,090 --> 00:01:35,560
well,
what's the point of all of this?

28
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:36,840
Well,
finance wise,

29
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:41,910
China is pretty blinds to ideology and 
the same goes for those American banks.

30
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:43,263
The only goal is to make money,
but at first sight and in Venezuela it 

31
00:01:46,601 --> 00:01:49,180
doesn't exactly look like a great place 
to do business.

32
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,990
How did Venezuela come to the attention 
of so many investors?

33
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,030
I mean,
where is the deal here?

34
00:01:58,090 --> 00:01:58,923
Well,
today we are going to answer all of 

35
00:02:00,041 --> 00:02:02,050
those questions,
but before we do,

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:07,080
let's take a look back at the history.
Okay,

37
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:08,733
so here's some advice.
If you ever wanted to become a dictator 

38
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:12,660
in your country and repress your 
opinions and torture,

39
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:16,360
you'll many political foes.
That is something you absolutely need,

40
00:02:16,510 --> 00:02:18,550
and yes,
of course that is money.

41
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:20,860
Yeah,
normal citizens can die from starvation,

42
00:02:20,861 --> 00:02:24,310
but your beliefs and your army cannot 
miss a single payday.

43
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,233
This is the biggest problem for an 
authoritarian leader like Nicolas 

44
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,490
Maduro.
The Venezuelan presidents,

45
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,640
his biggest problem is if the army 
decides to striking

46
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,473
against

47
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,160
following visual politic for a long 
time,

48
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,023
you know that Venezuela has almost no 
private company is say there's not much 

49
00:02:45,571 --> 00:02:46,404
money to be collected in taxes for the 
oil exports are no longer profitable 

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:53,550
since the oil prices went down in 2012.
In other words,

51
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:57,630
his only way to pay for this whole 
repressive apparatus is by getting loans

52
00:02:57,631 --> 00:02:58,770
on the international market.

53
00:03:04,190 --> 00:03:07,640
Hold on just a second here because 
things are not as easy as they seem.

54
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:10,640
Venezuela is a country with terrible 
economic problems.

55
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:14,360
This means if you lend them money,
chances are you're never going to get it

56
00:03:14,390 --> 00:03:15,223
back.
This is why we say the Venezuelan bonds 

57
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:20,580
are a very high risk investments as 
well,

58
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:23,240
but to countries do when investors don't
trust them.

59
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:24,103
Well,
they raised the interest rates and this 

60
00:03:25,821 --> 00:03:26,654
is why Venezuelan bonds have a yield of 
over 10 and 12 percent while a German 

61
00:03:30,441 --> 00:03:32,420
bonds,
which is way more reliable.

62
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,790
It doesn't surpass zero point five 
percent.

63
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,640
All right,
so what does all of this means?

64
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:37,543
Let's imagine we invest a thousand US 
dollars in Venezuelan bonds to be paid 

65
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:43,220
in 10 years with an interest of 10 
percent.

66
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,800
Theoretically,
the Venezuelan government is expected to

67
00:03:45,801 --> 00:03:48,260
give us back those thousand dollars that
we lead them,

68
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:52,250
but in the meantime you'll receive $100 
every year as an interest payment.

69
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:53,001
Well,
yes,

70
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,230
I can probably guess what you're 
thinking right now.

71
00:03:54,231 --> 00:03:56,030
That sounds like a pretty great 
business.

72
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:57,140
Well,
do you notice,

73
00:03:57,141 --> 00:04:02,141
get excited just yet.
As we said before,

74
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:06,930
Venezuela has a pretty high chance of 
default.

75
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:07,943
If the governments of Caracas,
the capital of Venezuela declares 

76
00:04:10,561 --> 00:04:11,394
bankruptcy and say two years,
we're going to have lost 80 percent of 

77
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:14,994
our investments.
This is why despite the high interest 

78
00:04:17,221 --> 00:04:18,054
rates,
Nicolas Maduro has founded harder and 

79
00:04:19,501 --> 00:04:22,320
harder to sell his bombs.
Amds well,

80
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,360
this explains news like this.

81
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:28,730
Goldman Sachs,

82
00:04:28,730 --> 00:04:30,950
it's Venezuela,
bond purchase sparks anger.

83
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:36,160
It paid about $865,000,000 for two point
$8,000,000,000 worth of bonds.

84
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:38,810
All right,
so what does this mean?

85
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:41,330
Well,
it means Goldman Sachs bought Venezuelan

86
00:04:41,331 --> 00:04:44,300
bonds for a third of their value.
In other words,

87
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,163
theoretically the government of 
Venezuela is expected to pay back two 

88
00:04:47,931 --> 00:04:48,764
point $8,000,000,000 to Goldman Sachs 
despite the fact that they only paid 

89
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:56,780
$865 million US dollars for them,
and so now you might be wondering,

90
00:04:56,781 --> 00:04:58,940
well,
why does Venezuela accept this deal?

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:04:59,833
Well,
the answer is simply because they need 

92
00:05:00,861 --> 00:05:03,650
cash or they needed as soon as possible.
Second,

93
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,220
they also know they're never going to 
happen

94
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,623
right

95
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,240
now.
You might be wondering,

96
00:05:13,241 --> 00:05:15,100
well,
why did bank is lend them the money?

97
00:05:15,101 --> 00:05:16,990
If they know they're not going to get it
back?

98
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:17,973
Whereas the business appeal here,
so basically this appeal bias and 

99
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:21,990
interest rates,
I mean,

100
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,130
think about it.
If Venezuela against Goldman Sachs,

101
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:26,440
10 percent of those two point 8 billion 
every year,

102
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:28,930
and that means the bank will have 
covered that investments,

103
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:32,770
those $865 million dollars in less than 
three years,

104
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,590
and after that,
everything is profit.

105
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,453
Now of course,
investors know that Venezuela is going 

106
00:05:38,621 --> 00:05:39,454
to default.

107
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:43,640
The

108
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,400
question here is when are they going to 
do it?

109
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:49,250
So investors are making a high risk that
yet it found a swale.

110
00:05:49,260 --> 00:05:52,560
It keeps paying for at least four years.
Banks will win if they don't,

111
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,350
the banks will lose.
And the truth is,

112
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:57,980
Nicolas Maduro is the first one 
interested in not bankruptcy.

113
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,993
On the one hand,
he needs to keep bankers on his side so 

114
00:06:00,831 --> 00:06:02,690
he can pay his repression.
Machinery.

115
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,570
On the other hand,
PDV s,

116
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,230
a Venezuela's state owned oil company 
has several properties abroad,

117
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,080
trees and refineries in countries like 
Haiti and the Dominican Republic.

118
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:19,063
If Caracas defaults,
some of those investors might seize 

119
00:06:21,471 --> 00:06:22,460
them.
This is white.

120
00:06:22,461 --> 00:06:23,294
For several years,
Venezuela has prioritized that debt 

121
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,040
payments over anything else.
Maduro is foreign.

122
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:30,470
Currency reserves went from more than 
$50,

123
00:06:30,471 --> 00:06:31,304
billion dollars to less than 10 billion.
And this explains why a magazine like 

124
00:06:34,911 --> 00:06:38,750
Forbes said this about Venezuelan bonds 
in 2016

125
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:39,703
steam.

126
00:06:42,170 --> 00:06:44,780
Venezuela might be the worst country in 
Latin America,

127
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:48,290
but it's bonds look great.
In the middle of 2017,

128
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:49,124
Donald Trump had to pass a law banning 
American banks and hedge funds from 

129
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:54,350
investing in Venezuela.
Nonetheless,

130
00:06:54,351 --> 00:06:58,880
no matter how badly maduro tried,
his economy was weaker than he thought.

131
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:05,710
Venezuela to restructure foreign debt 
default looms as possibility.

132
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,010
Yes,
you had that right.

133
00:07:07,011 --> 00:07:07,844
Goldman Sachs and the rest of those 
hedge funds who bought a Venezuelan 

134
00:07:10,301 --> 00:07:13,180
bonds at a discount price,
they've lost their best.

135
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,073
Nonetheless.
That is still one investor that is far 

136
00:07:15,791 --> 00:07:19,570
from being worried and yes,
of course we're talking about China.

137
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,590
China's puppet as we said at the 
beginning,

138
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:30,880
Venezuela is the country that received 
the most Chinese money in Latin America.

139
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,590
This,
unlike the private bankers,

140
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,820
China's government does not buy bonds on

141
00:07:34,930 --> 00:07:35,763
markets.

142
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:38,443
Instead she drink thing as a personal 
meeting with Nicolas Maduro and meeting 

143
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,713
where they negotiated a very special 
deal alone that is not to be paid back 

144
00:07:46,611 --> 00:07:49,220
with money,
but with oil this way.

145
00:07:49,221 --> 00:07:51,590
Beijing makes sure they have an oil 
supplier,

146
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:54,020
no matter what happens,
but all of them.

147
00:07:54,021 --> 00:07:55,430
A second tip,
because this formula,

148
00:07:55,510 --> 00:07:57,320
it's got its drawbacks too.
As you know,

149
00:07:57,330 --> 00:08:01,480
PDVSA is a hyper bureaucratic company 
with thousands of workers,

150
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:03,890
hard by Chavez,
out of pure nepotism.

151
00:08:09,460 --> 00:08:11,320
Oil drilling is harder and harder for 
them.

152
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:14,140
In fact,
they need those dinosaur juice shipments

153
00:08:14,141 --> 00:08:18,220
are arriving pretty late to China,
but despite all of that,

154
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,203
China keeps them loyalty to Venezuela.
That was showing solidarity with the 

155
00:08:25,181 --> 00:08:26,014
Venezuelan people because we are 
supporting the principals of the United 

156
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:32,330
Nations.
This is what we have to do that.

157
00:08:32,860 --> 00:08:34,690
So now the question becomes,
well,

158
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:35,613
why?
What does China get from Venezuela now 

159
00:08:37,241 --> 00:08:39,700
that they are facing problems with that 
while payments?

160
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:42,010
Well,
the answer lies in the long run.

161
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:44,820
Just think about it.
Beijing has already lent $50,

162
00:08:44,830 --> 00:08:45,663
billion dollars to crack us.
Now they just need patients and 

163
00:08:48,341 --> 00:08:49,174
stability.

164
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,070
Missouri Madeira

165
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:53,390
needs some years to pay back.
Is that?

166
00:08:53,391 --> 00:08:55,250
Well,
no rush project Mangan waste.

167
00:08:55,390 --> 00:08:56,223
However,
that is something that could risk the 

168
00:08:57,691 --> 00:09:01,620
payback of these debts and that is 
changing governments.

169
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:05,040
What would happen if the opposition to 
Nicolas Maduro took power?

170
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:07,110
Would they be willing to meet their 
obligations?

171
00:09:07,111 --> 00:09:08,820
Do they use you?
It helps the dictator,

172
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,460
the one who sent them to jail and 
probably tortured them.

173
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,430
Sounds like a pretty risky proposition.
Nan's well,

174
00:09:14,460 --> 00:09:15,293
risk is the least favorite word for the 
Chinese Communist Party and it explains 

175
00:09:19,861 --> 00:09:20,760
things like this

176
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:27,540
that is really defends purchase of 
Chinese right control gear.

177
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,120
After more than 70 deaths in street 
protests,

178
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:31,043
China has already sold over $350,
million dollars worth of weapons to 

179
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:37,530
Madeira so that he can stay in power.
Thanks to things movements.

180
00:09:37,531 --> 00:09:40,260
Caracas is China's biggest ally in the 
region.

181
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,213
Basically the Venezuelan government is 
to become the puppets of the Chinese 

182
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:46,460
Communist Party.
So well.

183
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:47,460
What happens?
Well,

184
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,323
maybe China wants to build new 
infrastructure in South America so they 

185
00:09:50,881 --> 00:09:53,570
can complete that Silk Road project.
While no problem,

186
00:09:53,571 --> 00:09:54,404
I'm in Venezuela.
Diplomats will support them with no 

187
00:09:55,921 --> 00:09:56,754
questions asked.
Maybe China wants to have a military 

188
00:09:58,051 --> 00:09:59,220
base in the region.
Well,

189
00:09:59,221 --> 00:10:01,470
welcome to Venezuela,
just like that.

190
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:05,250
They'll get thousands of square miles to
place that Ami as they please.

191
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:06,810
In other words,
well,

192
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,070
there isn't a better ally than the one 
that needs you in order to survive.

193
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:17,480
Venezuela hopes no country hinders 
China's fantastic Silk Road initiative.

194
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:18,373
Nonetheless,
that instilled dapcep having as much 

195
00:10:20,481 --> 00:10:21,314
power as they have.
China might request other kinds of 

196
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,710
reforms.
For instance,

197
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,830
if Venezuela that keeps facing problems 
with that oil payments,

198
00:10:27,950 --> 00:10:32,620
they might force maduro too for people 
at PD vsa and make it more productive.

199
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,380
That could even take over the 
exploitation of the old themselves.

200
00:10:38,390 --> 00:10:39,360
Sorry.

201
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,410
The question here is,
can Venezuela become China's colony?

202
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,860
Do you think China is going to seize 
Venezuelan oil forever?

203
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:47,753
Well,
we'd love to know your answer and you
