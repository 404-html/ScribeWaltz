1
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:10,660
Today we're going to talk about the 
Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

2
00:00:10,661 --> 00:00:13,300
The only country in the wells named 
quite say,

3
00:00:13,301 --> 00:00:16,600
ironically,
you may know it's better as North Korea,

4
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:18,130
it sounds democratic as they come 
through,

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:18,973
ruled by the same family for 70 years,
can be the head of state has been 

6
00:00:22,001 --> 00:00:26,500
inherited through three generations of 
the Kim family and Kim Il Sung,

7
00:00:26,501 --> 00:00:27,334
Kim Jong Il ams.
Now Kim Jong own ends in keeping with 

8
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:31,384
this publicly democratic tradition,
the leader of North Korea is called not 

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,890
president or not king,
but supremely supremely up.

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,620
You know,
just like any normal democracy.

11
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:45,953
So welcome.
We really sat on North Korea that you 

12
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:49,310
haven't had before.
Well,

13
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,144
it is one of the most brutal 
dictatorships in the whole wells when 

14
00:00:52,501 --> 00:00:53,334
mass torture,
execution and extreme poverty are 

15
00:00:55,610 --> 00:00:57,530
common.
And now you might ask,

16
00:00:57,531 --> 00:00:58,364
well,
why did we cast so much about this 

17
00:00:59,241 --> 00:01:00,021
country?
Well,

18
00:01:00,021 --> 00:01:03,560
the answer to that is as simple as 
nuclear bombs.

19
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,513
This is a country that is still 
officially at war with South Korea and 

20
00:01:07,341 --> 00:01:12,080
it makes a pastime of threatening Japan 
and the US with nuclear annihilation.

21
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:13,093
And while that might have sounded 
farfetched at one point in time with 

22
00:01:15,441 --> 00:01:17,870
nuclear tests happening almost every 
other year,

23
00:01:17,900 --> 00:01:20,270
people are starting to take a little old
Kim,

24
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,470
a bit more serious

25
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,730
sleep.

26
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:29,970
You still might wonder if North Korea is
that dangerous?

27
00:01:29,971 --> 00:01:31,950
Well,
why isn't anyone stopping them?

28
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:32,903
Well,
they actually tried basically every 

29
00:01:34,801 --> 00:01:38,520
sanction you could think of hasn't been 
thrown at North Korea bus.

30
00:01:38,550 --> 00:01:39,383
Instead of that financial pressure 
forcing reform North Korea has just had 

31
00:01:42,751 --> 00:01:43,584
it's diplomats selling meth out of their
embassies well worldwide to shortlist 

32
00:01:47,070 --> 00:01:47,940
there.
Yes,

33
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:50,970
indeed.
That on North Korean embassies and two,

34
00:01:50,971 --> 00:01:53,970
yes indeed they were selling drugs out 
of them.

35
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:57,550
But there's one country that still calls
North Korea,

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,260
uh,
friends.

37
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:02,580
And that country is China.
They even have a treaty called the Sino,

38
00:02:02,581 --> 00:02:05,250
North Korea and mutual aid and 
cooperation.

39
00:02:05,251 --> 00:02:06,084
Friendship Treaty,
China and North Korea are as close to 

40
00:02:11,411 --> 00:02:13,600
each other as lips are two teeth,
China.

41
00:02:13,601 --> 00:02:14,434
And to a lesser extent,
Russia have been the only things 

42
00:02:16,601 --> 00:02:17,434
propping up the North Korean regime.
So that must give China a lot of sway 

43
00:02:20,921 --> 00:02:21,754
over the Kim Jong Rights.
While that's what the international 

44
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:24,724
community thought that south China came 
to be seen as the only country in the 

45
00:02:27,521 --> 00:02:32,521
world could turn in order to reign in 
North Korea's nuclear ambitions as well,

46
00:02:32,921 --> 00:02:33,754
not so fast because things are changing 
in China is starting to get a rather 

47
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:39,150
annoyed at that little brothers Tom 
foolery.

48
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:43,193
So the question today is,
what's behind the cooling relationship 

49
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:47,363
between China and North Korea and what 
consequences could this have on the 

50
00:02:50,821 --> 00:02:51,654
future of the country?
Joining us today to answer these 

51
00:02:53,551 --> 00:02:56,520
questions is the biggest China expert on
youtube.

52
00:02:56,521 --> 00:02:58,650
Yes.
We are talking about Chris Chapple,

53
00:02:58,651 --> 00:03:00,610
the host of China or uncensored

54
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:03,880
Hello Simon and hello to all our friends
at visual politic.

55
00:03:03,910 --> 00:03:05,560
So relationship between these two 
communists.

56
00:03:05,561 --> 00:03:06,394
Brothers have deteriorated so much in 
China and North Korea are in the middle 

57
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:10,564
of a war of work.
Basically China said that it would work 

58
00:03:15,551 --> 00:03:16,384
with the evil imperialists.
You know the US do combat North Korea's 

59
00:03:20,351 --> 00:03:21,184
nuclear program.
Then North Korean state run media 

60
00:03:23,381 --> 00:03:24,214
responded that China should really think
about how it's reckless act of chopping 

61
00:03:27,821 --> 00:03:28,654
down the pillar of North Korea.
China relations could have grave 

62
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:32,823
consequences.
And then Johnny state run media 

63
00:03:34,571 --> 00:03:37,870
responded with a not so subtle threat to
end their alliance.

64
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:38,963
So why is that the.
Are they stabbing each other in the 

65
00:03:40,321 --> 00:03:41,154
back?
But we're going to have a look at that 

66
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:42,714
right now.
China North Korea showing that ends up 

67
00:03:48,311 --> 00:03:51,130
North Korea really make the perfect best
friends.

68
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:53,320
They have much in common.
They share a border.

69
00:03:53,321 --> 00:03:55,360
They both had communist uprisings,
ams,

70
00:03:55,361 --> 00:03:58,630
they have installed leaders who have 
radical views of Marxism.

71
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,560
The People's Republic of China,
ends of the Democratic People's Republic

72
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:03,393
of Korea.
Really all like the Quintin Tarantino 

73
00:04:04,661 --> 00:04:07,900
and Robert Rodriguez on international 
politics.

74
00:04:08,210 --> 00:04:09,910
Especially like if you're doing a movie 
or something.

75
00:04:09,911 --> 00:04:10,744
Doing it with Robert is just the idea 
that that's a year I get to hang out 

76
00:04:13,481 --> 00:04:14,400
with Robert.
Now

77
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,380
China does more than just give North 
Korea financial aid.

78
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:18,333
Jen has also made big loans of the North
Korean regime so they can build 

79
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,544
railroads and highways and they're 
pretty forgiving when p young can't pay 

80
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:28,360
back its debt.
And then there's oil.

81
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:29,253
For decades,
China was the main source of dino juice 

82
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:34,120
to North Korea.
There's military

83
00:04:34,450 --> 00:04:35,283
great

84
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:39,523
help train North Korean hackers,
hackers who've now become a threat to 

85
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:45,920
the international community,
including China.

86
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:49,130
What does Beijing get in exchange?
Well,

87
00:04:49,131 --> 00:04:52,400
North Korea is a cheap labor paradise.
In fact,

88
00:04:52,401 --> 00:04:56,030
in many products with the made in China,
labels should actually say,

89
00:04:56,090 --> 00:04:57,170
made in DPR.

90
00:04:57,200 --> 00:04:58,033
Okay,

91
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:03,390
brilliant sportswear brand.
Rip Curl made a public apology this week

92
00:05:03,391 --> 00:05:04,224
afterward emerged that some of it's 
skier had been made in one of North 

93
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:08,163
Korea.
Stayed on factor,

94
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,400
but hold on a minute because things are 
starting to change.

95
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:15,293
The Chinese Communist Party today is a 
little less interested in the global 

96
00:05:18,121 --> 00:05:18,954
spread of communism and then there's one
more interested in becoming a global 

97
00:05:22,021 --> 00:05:24,930
superpower.
North Korea is well,

98
00:05:24,931 --> 00:05:25,764
very rarely cramping China's style.
Imagine how hard it is to be cool with 

99
00:05:28,771 --> 00:05:29,604
America when you're good.
Buddy North Korea keeps threatening to 

100
00:05:31,561 --> 00:05:35,220
blow them up,
but this is the end of the story.

101
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,113
Sixty years ago,
China and North Korea were pretty 

102
00:05:37,861 --> 00:05:40,410
similar,
but today things are quite different.

103
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,353
Terrorists came to see closely is the 
misery experienced by the North Korean 

104
00:05:44,291 --> 00:05:47,420
neighbors.
I'm not old,

105
00:05:47,421 --> 00:05:48,254
but I feel like what I can see over 
there is similar to the very difficult 

106
00:05:50,961 --> 00:05:52,670
time that our nation had in the past,

107
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:53,673
a loss of North Korean citizens would do
whatever it takes in order to cross the 

108
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:58,154
Chinese borden and Beijing is scared of 
what could become a refugee crisis 

109
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:03,350
similar to that of Syria.

110
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,333
If this wasn't enough,
Pyongyang's diplomacy hasn't been all 

111
00:06:06,891 --> 00:06:07,724
that diplomatic with its own allies.
Here's a little snub courtesy of Kim 

112
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:12,740
Jong Un in 2015

113
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,373
in all female North Korean pop band 
formed by leader Kim Jong Un abruptly 

114
00:06:23,001 --> 00:06:26,640
canceled a Beijing concert on Saturday 
and headed back home to Pyongyang,

115
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,313
but unfortunately it February 2017 
became the breaking points for this 

116
00:06:37,251 --> 00:06:37,970
friendship.

117
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:38,803
North Korea launching some ballistic 
missiles or conducting some nuclear 

118
00:06:41,331 --> 00:06:42,164
tests is nothing new,
but what is do is the degree to which 

119
00:06:45,831 --> 00:06:49,520
China is willing to criticize it.
This is happening at a time when Chinese

120
00:06:49,521 --> 00:06:50,354
leader Xi Jingping is trying to improve 
his relationship with the United States 

121
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:55,240
and of course,
according to young.

122
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:00,520
This is a stab in the back,
triggered the war of words between these

123
00:07:04,231 --> 00:07:08,100
two countries with state run media in 
both countries criticizing the other,

124
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,030
but again,
this is not the end of the story.

125
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,570
Remember those Chinese trains?
North Korean hackers,

126
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:15,610
there's allegedly hit several Hollywood 
studios two years ago.

127
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:17,710
Well,
if you lay down with dogs,

128
00:07:17,711 --> 00:07:20,200
don't be surprised if you wake up with 
fleas

129
00:07:24,010 --> 00:07:26,210
called ransomware attacks that began 
Friday.

130
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:29,630
Have struck China hard.
If North Korea is responsible,

131
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:30,523
even unintentionally,
it wouldn't be the first known attempt 

132
00:07:32,631 --> 00:07:36,500
by Pyong Young to digitally Pilfer 
China's coffers at such a scale.

133
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:37,570
In other words,
buying,

134
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:38,413
keeping things the same.
North Korea is about to lose their 

135
00:07:40,821 --> 00:07:41,654
biggest ally,
the only country willing to defend them 

136
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,773
in case of war.
This is a war even if just for 

137
00:07:46,881 --> 00:07:50,360
propaganda reasons.
A lot of people would love to start.

138
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:52,910
Hey,

139
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,903
trump,
come in.

140
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:57,280
I know what you're thinking.
Oh,

141
00:07:57,281 --> 00:07:57,941
Simon,
this.

142
00:07:57,941 --> 00:07:58,774
This is quite a story and need some 
needs to become a true visual politic 

143
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,610
video.
So well,

144
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:06,860
no.

145
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:10,053
Russia has already taken over the supply
of jet fuel to North Korea after China 

146
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:13,834
halted exports two years ago.
According to the industry sources in 

147
00:08:16,211 --> 00:08:16,600
China,

148
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,410
Russia and North Korea also have a lot 
of things in common apart from sharing a

149
00:08:20,411 --> 00:08:22,210
border.
They both have strong,

150
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:27,240
attractive and manly lead.
Both countries.

151
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:32,093
Human rights are considered optional.
Russia and North Korea just started a 

152
00:08:34,711 --> 00:08:35,544
ferry service that connects their two 
countries to Russian companies can be 

153
00:08:38,521 --> 00:08:41,970
regularly stock with a North Korean 
slave workforce.

154
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:44,460
Does that mean Putin and Kim are now 
besties?

155
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:45,420
Well,
so fast

156
00:08:45,470 --> 00:08:49,360
because Kim Jong Un has a rather funny 
concept of truth.

157
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:50,323
No,

158
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:54,650
rhea launches a missile near Russians.

159
00:08:56,740 --> 00:08:57,481
Alright,
listen,

160
00:08:57,481 --> 00:08:58,314
Kim Jong Un dude.
This is really not the way you made 

161
00:09:00,641 --> 00:09:03,210
friends and as you might imagine with 
things like this,

162
00:09:03,211 --> 00:09:06,000
Russia may not be too big to become a 
north.

163
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:09,780
Korea is unconditional allied and so for
the first time in its history,

164
00:09:09,781 --> 00:09:10,614
the most hated country.
It has run out of allies and this is 

165
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:15,330
where donald trump's steps into the vic 
trap.

166
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,283
We have a big problem.
We have somebody that is not doing the 

167
00:09:18,871 --> 00:09:19,704
right thing,
and that's going to be my 

168
00:09:21,151 --> 00:09:22,110
responsibility.

169
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:22,983
This comes at a time when China is 
trying to work on a new trade deal with 

170
00:09:26,261 --> 00:09:27,094
the United States at the same time that 
Donald trump is facing a lot of 

171
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:30,490
pressure.

172
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,323
Hi.

173
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:33,803
So the question is now,
will Donald Trump be taking 

174
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,660
responsibility for North Korea to 
improve his image in the United States?

175
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:42,690
Could this be the end of the North 
Korean dictatorship?

176
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:43,524
