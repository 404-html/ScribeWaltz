1
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:09,403
Just before we get started,
I do want to say I've got a brand new 

2
00:00:10,611 --> 00:00:12,130
channel.
It's called biographics,

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,060
longer form,
20 minutes ish.

4
00:00:14,061 --> 00:00:16,310
Biographies about notable people from 
history,

5
00:00:16,311 --> 00:00:19,250
not just politicians at all sorts of 
different folks.

6
00:00:19,251 --> 00:00:20,084
Please follow the link in the 
description below and check it out if 

7
00:00:21,681 --> 00:00:22,970
you're looking for something else to 
watch.

8
00:00:22,990 --> 00:00:23,823
All right,
so in the tax it is the largest fashion 

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:26,834
distribution on the planet and it's the 
most successful company in the history 

10
00:00:29,481 --> 00:00:30,314
of Spain.
It's got an annual turnover of 

11
00:00:31,551 --> 00:00:32,384
$27,000,000,000 and consequently this 
company has managed to make it into the 

12
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:39,390
top 60 largest companies in the world.
And if you want a buyer,

13
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,750
well then you better have a thick 
wallet.

14
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,120
Get need to spend $125,
billion dollars to make the acquisition.

15
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:52,170
Company name might be unfamiliar to some
of you,

16
00:00:52,171 --> 00:00:55,710
but I am sure you will recognize many of
its fashion labels.

17
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:59,130
Look inside this corporation and you'll 
find such well known brands as Zara.

18
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:02,400
Massimo Dutti,
his Stradivarius show,

19
00:01:02,610 --> 00:01:05,190
Zahra Parkway,
and although smaller,

20
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,800
you can also find lefties,
they are low cost brand,

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:14,390
partly flagship brands of this 
corporation is definitely Zara.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:15,283
I'm sure you know it's.
It's our stores open in almost every 

23
00:01:17,151 --> 00:01:17,984
country around the world and it is here 
in Zuora where the corporation makes 60 

24
00:01:21,741 --> 00:01:22,574
percent of its total sales for the most 
striking thing here is not just the 

25
00:01:25,581 --> 00:01:27,530
figures,
it's the company's evolution.

26
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:28,393
It just a few years into Texas,
turns into the world's largest textile 

27
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:32,024
group with stores on the most expensive 
streets in the world and it all started 

28
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:37,040
as a modest Spanish

29
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
in a.
This

30
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:50,240
kind of thing might be less unusual in a
country like the USA,

31
00:01:50,241 --> 00:01:53,930
but I can assure you it's ratified in 
such a phenomenon in Spain.

32
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,793
That is why we're going to analyze 
interjects today from its humble 

33
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,450
beginnings,
through the keys to its success,

34
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:00,730
and of course,
well,

35
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,150
it's immense.
Profits,

36
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:12,650
origins of a giant.

37
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:15,330
No.
The

38
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:16,163
origins of insects.
We must go back to the seventies when 

39
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:22,410
Spanish businessmen that Amancio Ortega 
opens the first Zara store.

40
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:23,303
Now you might be wondering,
where did Ortega get the inspiration to 

41
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:29,810
start out such a profitable moneymaker?
Well,

42
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:30,713
it's difficult to say,
but we do know this man has been 

43
00:02:32,551 --> 00:02:35,820
involved with the fashion industry from 
a very young age.

44
00:02:35,850 --> 00:02:39,000
When he was only 14,
he was already working as a delivery boy

45
00:02:39,001 --> 00:02:42,780
for a well known shirt shop in a small 
industrial city in the north of Spain.

46
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,820
Yup.
Times have absolutely changed.

47
00:02:44,821 --> 00:02:45,654
Back then,
Spain was very different to how it is 

48
00:02:47,161 --> 00:02:47,994
now.
It was a much poorer country and it 

49
00:02:49,141 --> 00:02:52,200
wasn't unusual to find a 14 year olds in
employment,

50
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,443
but let's focus it on the thing.
Ortega sort was a clear business 

51
00:02:57,151 --> 00:02:57,984
opportunity and he seemed designed it to
make his mark on the international 

52
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:02,350
market in 1988.

53
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,780
He opened his first store outside 
Spanish,

54
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:05,614
borders in Porto in Portugal.
Soon after he crossed the Atlantic and 

55
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,220
set foot in New York and he has been 
unstoppable since then.

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,450
The UK,
Japan,

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:14,313
Kuwait.
Right now you can find an intersect 

58
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:20,881
store in almost every large city in 
capital city in the world into tanks,

59
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:25,090
brand owner of Zara and plans to open 
stores in Vietnam,

60
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:28,150
New Zealand,
Paraguay of Aruba and Nicaragua.

61
00:03:28,151 --> 00:03:28,984
This year,
the voice of Vietnam today into it says 

62
00:03:30,550 --> 00:03:33,520
more than 7,000,
300 stores across the globe.

63
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:34,383
It's made markets were Intersex,
has more shops outside Spain that in 

64
00:03:37,210 --> 00:03:39,170
China and Russia,
as you can imagine,

65
00:03:39,171 --> 00:03:41,050
all of there's international expansion.
Well,

66
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:41,884
it's certainly had a reward or take it 
to that child who saw no other choice 

67
00:03:45,551 --> 00:03:49,270
but to work to survive and do founded 
into tax when he was almost 40.

68
00:03:49,271 --> 00:03:52,090
Is today one of the wealthiest people on
Earth.

69
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,953
According to Forbes.
Ortega's fortune is more than 

70
00:03:54,611 --> 00:03:59,230
$55,000,000,000 and well there is the 
billion dollar question.

71
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:00,610
Well,
how did he do it?

72
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:01,900
Well,
let's take a look at that.

73
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,840
Keys to success.
As you say that innovation is limited to

74
00:04:13,081 --> 00:04:14,790
the realms of the high tech industry.
Well,

75
00:04:14,791 --> 00:04:15,624
you probably don't know about into tax 
and pay attention here because we're 

76
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:18,744
going to look at how this company has 
turned the entire textile industry 

77
00:04:21,691 --> 00:04:25,770
upside down by competing in a very 
different way to rival company

78
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,033
for textile industry thing.
It doesn't exactly sound incredibly 

79
00:04:32,291 --> 00:04:34,990
groundbreaking does it as well.
This company,

80
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:35,883
they've achieved immense growth growth 
which can mainly be attributed to 

81
00:04:39,430 --> 00:04:40,263
innovation like daring to be different.
Now let's analyze in depth some of the 

82
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,330
keys to business success first.
Well,

83
00:04:46,331 --> 00:04:48,430
we need to pay attention to the 
company's brain.

84
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,293
Yes,
interface does have some sort of brain 

85
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,530
and this is the operation room that the 
company established in our t show.

86
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:57,730
A small town in Galicia.
Now you could be forgiven for mistaking.

87
00:04:57,731 --> 00:05:01,360
This is some sort of NASA control room,
but at least for now,

88
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:04,390
no rockets or satellites have managed 
from here in this room.

89
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:08,500
They control and analyze everything that
takes place across all of the companies.

90
00:05:08,501 --> 00:05:10,320
Stores can real time.
You see,

91
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:13,870
even though a large part of the clothing
production takes place in countries like

92
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:14,800
Morocco,
Turkey,

93
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:15,910
Brazil,
or Bangladesh,

94
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:16,773
everything or almost everything goes 
through Spain before it is sent to 

95
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,130
stores.
For instance,

96
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:23,530
let's think about a Zara store in 
Shanghai.

97
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,423
It would be logical for us to think that
since the clothes are made in 

98
00:05:26,291 --> 00:05:27,124
Bangladesh,
that they should be sent directly to 

99
00:05:28,721 --> 00:05:30,130
China from that.
Right?

100
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:31,930
Well,
that's not what happens at all.

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,590
They're actually taken to Spain and then
they sent back to Asia.

102
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,760
This might seem counterintuitive,
but it does have an explanation.

103
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,410
No.

104
00:05:43,760 --> 00:05:46,370
Shops sell the same quantity of each 
type of clothing.

105
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,510
The purpose of this operation is to 
control how much is sold and what's kind

106
00:05:50,511 --> 00:05:52,550
of thesis are sent to each of the 
groups,

107
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:53,570
shops,
the model,

108
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,620
the color,
the size,

109
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:55,140
et.

110
00:05:55,140 --> 00:05:55,973
Yeah.

111
00:05:58,790 --> 00:06:01,670
Considering this data,
the stores receive pieces of clothing as

112
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:04,760
appropriate for that individual needs.
It is only logical,

113
00:06:04,761 --> 00:06:05,594
for example,
that the Zara on Fifth Avenue of does 

114
00:06:07,101 --> 00:06:07,934
not sell the same items that the Zara's 
of Miami beach or I bet key to success 

115
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,633
is logistics,
which is closely related to the first 

116
00:06:16,651 --> 00:06:19,650
one,
intersect supplies its doors two or even

117
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:20,484
three times a week,
and they can deliver to any of their 

118
00:06:22,291 --> 00:06:23,124
stores in just 48 hours.
You can imagine what's in it for this 

119
00:06:26,041 --> 00:06:27,840
requires,
but with this time in the company,

120
00:06:27,841 --> 00:06:28,674
it gets several things in return.
They reduce stock in storage and reduce 

121
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:32,514
the storage space required in the shops.
Less dark means less money and less 

122
00:06:36,331 --> 00:06:38,760
storage.
Space means more space for sale.

123
00:06:42,340 --> 00:06:45,460
In all of this means,
well of course that means more money.

124
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,353
Furthermore,
it also helps to have an updated sales 

125
00:06:48,011 --> 00:06:49,220
line,
and this by the way,

126
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:54,250
is the third key to into Texas success.
No more lasting collections

127
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,953
company.
The clothes aren't often renewed on 

128
00:07:00,391 --> 00:07:03,990
average every fortnight,
so dive Teesha is not selling.

129
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:07,440
It's out just like that in finishes from
the shelves and never to be seen again.

130
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,600
However,
if a piece of clothing is selling well,

131
00:07:09,601 --> 00:07:13,110
the customer knows he won't find many 
people wearing the same products because

132
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:16,440
it's production is limited to a short 
period of time,

133
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:18,570
so when something is popular in itself 
as well,

134
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:20,820
the company doesn't provide more of 
these items.

135
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:23,730
What the designers do is they sort of 
recycle the model.

136
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,623
The essence is kept,
but some modifications are made so they 

137
00:07:27,691 --> 00:07:30,210
follow the trend,
but they don't repeat it.

138
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:33,060
It all explains why every time we walk 
into one of these shops,

139
00:07:33,061 --> 00:07:36,480
most of what we see is different to the 
products we saw the last time.

140
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:39,090
So to sum up with the operation room,
daily analysis,

141
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:40,470
logistics,
new designs,

142
00:07:40,471 --> 00:07:41,304
well,
this company is starting to not sound 

143
00:07:42,721 --> 00:07:44,100
that traditional,
isn't it?

144
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,460
But I'm sure you probably want to know 
more about those huge figures.

145
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:47,941
Say,
well,

146
00:07:47,941 --> 00:07:52,941
let's jump into that now.
The large figures,

147
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,413
if there weren't three words to define 
this enormous player of the fashion 

148
00:08:05,241 --> 00:08:07,400
industry,
these would be well growth,

149
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:08,270
growth,
and yeah,

150
00:08:08,271 --> 00:08:09,104
the third word would also be growth.
Now we've discussed the main keys that 

151
00:08:11,571 --> 00:08:12,404
have helped to build this empire.
So now let's see what's going on within 

152
00:08:15,141 --> 00:08:15,974
the company and to do this,
we need to take a look at the periods 

153
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:18,743
between 2006 and 2016 and only 10 years 
into text has been able to multiply 

154
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:28,970
their sales by three.
They've doubled the number of stores and

155
00:08:28,971 --> 00:08:33,971
they've expanded to 50 new countries.
Not so bad for just 10 years.

156
00:08:35,571 --> 00:08:36,321
Right?
Well,

157
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:38,690
in previous videos like the one we did 
on Amazon,

158
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:42,170
we said we'd like to highlight the real 
money company generates.

159
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:43,063
That is the difference between the money
that comes in and the money that goes 

160
00:08:45,381 --> 00:08:47,300
out the cash flow.
Well,

161
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,163
if we do it again for Inditex,
we can see the cash flow has multiplied 

162
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:54,350
by three in the last 10 years.
If we look at the numbers,

163
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,213
we see how this real profit has gone 
from one point 4 billion euros to 4 

164
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:02,010
billion euros every year.
In other words,

165
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:02,873
Mr Ortega System,
it's certainly works and this does not 

166
00:09:06,001 --> 00:09:06,834
just work great for shareholders because
inditex has been an absolute employment 

167
00:09:10,501 --> 00:09:13,140
machine.
This company now has more than a hundred

168
00:09:13,141 --> 00:09:16,710
and 60,000 workers around the world,
but that's not the end of it,

169
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,573
not even close because if we bear in 
mind all the suppliers that inditex 

170
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:21,383
works with,
that number could be in excess of a 

171
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,893
million workers,

172
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:30,583
million people that in one way or 
another have a drama because of a 

173
00:09:32,711 --> 00:09:33,544
company that was born in the 19 
seventies in a small city in the north 

174
00:09:36,581 --> 00:09:37,414
of Spain,
a company that was founded by a humble 

175
00:09:39,251 --> 00:09:41,080
man,
a worker with ambition.

176
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:41,993
It's all variable.

177
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,593
I.
That is why would Tayga has become an 

178
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,960
idol for many young Spanish school 
students.

179
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:53,300
They aspire to be like him when they 
grow up.

180
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:54,913
Spanish high school students want to be 
like a month ago or take a in the 

181
00:09:58,161 --> 00:09:59,000
future.
Anyway,

182
00:09:59,030 --> 00:09:59,863
now I see all.
Do you often find yourself shopping in 

183
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,590
stores even though maybe it never heard 
of it before?

184
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:05,780
I'm wants your opinion on Ortega.
