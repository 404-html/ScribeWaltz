1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:09,410 --> 00:00:11,150
have you ever heard this phrase?

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:13,543
Yes.

4
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,250
Sounds pretty good,
right?

5
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:17,960
I mean,
it's quite a proclamation,

6
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:18,843
a call to an epic objective and appeal 
to the people's pride towards 

7
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,930
resistance.
But truth is though,

8
00:00:23,931 --> 00:00:24,764
that over the years,
this slogan has become one of the 

9
00:00:26,241 --> 00:00:29,450
chance,
the essential slogans of every protest,

10
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:30,343
especially in Latin America and 
especially in protests and 

11
00:00:33,291 --> 00:00:34,124
demonstrations of Marxist Leninist,
Maoist and socialist movements of all 

12
00:00:37,551 --> 00:00:38,560
kinds.
Going back,

13
00:00:38,561 --> 00:00:43,561
one thing [inaudible] what about the get
that'll regarding battle,

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,090
because there aren't the 20th century,
these types of chance,

15
00:00:47,091 --> 00:00:47,924
proclamations and slogans supported a 
huge number of groups and protest 

16
00:00:51,411 --> 00:00:52,244
movements throughout Latin America.
This happened to such an extent that in 

17
00:00:54,861 --> 00:00:57,470
many cases,
these epicondyle brave slogans,

18
00:00:57,471 --> 00:00:58,304
they had a far more terrible phenomenon 
of phenomenon that it became one of the 

19
00:01:01,761 --> 00:01:04,850
most remarkable characteristics of the 
entire region,

20
00:01:04,880 --> 00:01:05,713
the gorillas,

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,820
[inaudible] [inaudible].

22
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,870
What does the gorilla phenomenon consist
of and why did it emerge?

23
00:01:17,871 --> 00:01:18,704
I mean,
how could gorillas have such an impact 

24
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:22,350
and so much power in,
well,

25
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:24,740
what's their situation like today?
What are we going around?

26
00:01:24,770 --> 00:01:26,990
So all of those questions,
and there's a video,

27
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,580
but first a bit of history

28
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,690
come,
hey,

29
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:42,260
the spark that ignited the flame is the 
1960s the gorilla phenomenon is about to

30
00:01:44,411 --> 00:01:46,980
begin the Cuban revolution.
It's just happens.

31
00:01:46,981 --> 00:01:49,270
And folks,
we really can't talk about guerrillas in

32
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:52,270
Latin America without us taking Cuba's 
roll into account.

33
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:55,400
Yep.

34
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,233
You heard that right?
The Cuban revolution was a great source 

35
00:01:58,341 --> 00:02:00,980
of inspiration for all kinds of anti 
imperialist,

36
00:02:00,981 --> 00:02:04,070
revolutionary and communist movements.
Not only that,

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:04,933
but over the years,
Cuba say became the number one promoter 

38
00:02:07,101 --> 00:02:09,170
of guerrilla groups in the entire 
region.

39
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,970
Yeah.
We could say that Cuba,

40
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,040
it was quite a powerful station,
that center.

41
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,813
The fact is that the myth of the Cuban 
Revolution was the main reason that 

42
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:23,750
thousands of young idealists,
in many cases with good intentions helps

43
00:02:23,751 --> 00:02:24,584
10 last in America into a Hornet's nest.
How could they resist the exploits of 

44
00:02:28,220 --> 00:02:32,390
the Great Command of Fidel Castro,
the leader of that supposedly managed to

45
00:02:32,391 --> 00:02:34,880
get the revolution running with just 82 
people.

46
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,710
If he could do it,
why could ends others?

47
00:02:36,711 --> 00:02:38,180
I mean,
get the rifle boys.

48
00:02:38,181 --> 00:02:39,170
Let's crack on.
Well,

49
00:02:39,171 --> 00:02:42,620
many of these young people,
they clearly felt this quite fervently.

50
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,330
You see,
the truth is that the revolution managed

51
00:02:47,331 --> 00:02:48,164
to triumph to a great extent,
is precisely because of the excessive 

52
00:02:50,931 --> 00:02:53,720
violence and repression of the Cuban 
dictator,

53
00:02:53,721 --> 00:02:55,100
full henslow,
Battista.

54
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,500
These were accesses that got a good part
of the army,

55
00:02:57,501 --> 00:03:00,150
including several officers who align 
with Castro.

56
00:03:00,230 --> 00:03:01,063
Great.

57
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,700
And by the way,
did you know that unlike what's commonly

58
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:05,534
said to this heroic revolution,
it didn't really have a clear 

59
00:03:08,090 --> 00:03:09,350
ideological objective.

60
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:14,350
First,

61
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:15,183
in 1959 Fidel Castro,
he never tired of repeating again and 

62
00:03:17,871 --> 00:03:19,610
again to the Cuban people,
among others.

63
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:22,460
He wasn't a communist.
Fidel himself,

64
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:23,413
he said this,
I know you're worried about whether or 

65
00:03:25,311 --> 00:03:27,890
not were communists.
I want to make this clear.

66
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:30,500
We aren't communists.
I'm not a communist,

67
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,170
and neither is our movement.
You,

68
00:03:32,171 --> 00:03:35,840
they'll Castro communities.
And in a future video,

69
00:03:35,841 --> 00:03:37,970
we probably do need to talk about the 
Cuban revolution.

70
00:03:37,971 --> 00:03:40,460
So we'll do that at some point in the 
future.

71
00:03:40,490 --> 00:03:41,330
But folks,
many,

72
00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:44,540
many members over the revolution,
they were communists.

73
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,433
However,
it wasn't until two years after the 

74
00:03:46,491 --> 00:03:47,324
revolutionary triumph in 1961 that Fidel
declared himself a Marxist Leninist and 

75
00:03:51,530 --> 00:03:53,450
proclaimed the socialist revolution.

76
00:04:00,460 --> 00:04:01,293
Yeah.

77
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:02,983
We can ask ourselves two questions.
What change in these two years and why 

78
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:07,880
is this important?
Well,

79
00:04:07,881 --> 00:04:08,714
listen up

80
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:16,160
operation center

81
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:23,690
speak their Washington politicians never
believed Fidel Castro statements denying

82
00:04:23,691 --> 00:04:24,650
communism.
In fact,

83
00:04:24,651 --> 00:04:27,980
they saw this new regime in Havana is a 
danger during the cold war.

84
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:31,330
That's how the disastrous Bay of Pigs 
invasion attempt merged.

85
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:34,070
At the same time,
this was quite clear to the Soviet Union

86
00:04:34,071 --> 00:04:36,980
leaders.
Cuba meant an incredible opportunity and

87
00:04:36,981 --> 00:04:38,570
mainly for three reasons.

88
00:04:39,990 --> 00:04:40,670
Okay.

89
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,210
First,
by allying with Cuba,

90
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,073
they'd gain a very advantages 
geographical position to the United 

91
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,630
States.
They would have a friendly territory and

92
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,870
a military base just a few kilometers 
from the American maintenance.

93
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:52,763
Second day,
socialist Cuba would mean a new 

94
00:04:54,061 --> 00:04:54,894
satellite stage.
Thus reinforcing that position in 

95
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:58,740
international politics and third,
Cuba.

96
00:04:58,741 --> 00:05:02,760
It could become the operations center to
spread communism in the u s is so called

97
00:05:02,761 --> 00:05:04,410
back yard.
That's Latin American.

98
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,293
Gotcha.

99
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,823
That way folks,
that Soviet Union's chances of winning 

100
00:05:10,481 --> 00:05:11,314
the Cold War,
they absolutely grew stronger and you 

101
00:05:13,321 --> 00:05:14,154
know what has we usually say here at 
visual politic so that we said and say 

102
00:05:16,901 --> 00:05:19,540
it was done.
The regime then led by Nikita Khrushchev

103
00:05:19,541 --> 00:05:23,980
concentrated on consolidating its 
relations with the new Castro I'd Cuba,

104
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:27,150
and it was quite a strong focus from 
that very moment,

105
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,680
Cuba became a center for training,
financing,

106
00:05:29,681 --> 00:05:33,460
and supplying equipment and weapons for 
their revolutionary movements throughout

107
00:05:33,461 --> 00:05:34,294
the continents.
That's how Havana became the biggest 

108
00:05:36,191 --> 00:05:38,530
gorilla uprising promoter in Latin 
America.

109
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:43,540
The duty of every revolutionary is to 
make the revolution.

110
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,050
The second declaration of Havana,
February 4th,

111
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,883
1962 the idea development by El Che was 
that a small group of activists could 

112
00:05:50,981 --> 00:05:51,814
initiate a typical guerrilla war actions
and blew up existing institutions to 

113
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,280
spread the flames of the socialist.
And not just that,

114
00:05:58,281 --> 00:06:02,060
they also promoted a new strategy known 
as cultural Marxism.

115
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,020
This,
by the way,

116
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:03,883
it's still seen in many places.
So what exactly does this strategy 

117
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:07,543
consistent of?
Basically it's using education and 

118
00:06:09,111 --> 00:06:09,944
culture app to help communist and 
revolutionary ideologies infiltrates 

119
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:13,994
society to this ends.
The Cuban regime supported the creation 

120
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,750
of songs,
poems,

121
00:06:17,751 --> 00:06:18,584
university writings into literary works 
of all kinds with a common 

122
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:22,663
characteristic.
All of them were steeped in 

123
00:06:24,081 --> 00:06:26,750
revolutionary ideology and among other 
things,

124
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:30,860
extolled the gorilla figure.
Take Education and culture,

125
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,650
and the rest.
We'll add on Antonio Gramsci.

126
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,573
Now,
if you want to know more about how 

127
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:37,340
Havana supported some of the most famous
gorillas.

128
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:38,630
Well,
listen up

129
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,503
ties

130
00:06:48,050 --> 00:06:50,690
the first operation,
it happens in Nicaragua.

131
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:51,583
Thanks to Moscow and Savannah's 
technical and military and economic 

132
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:54,554
support.
The Revolutionary Leader Carlos Fon 

133
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:56,863
sacker amador,
promoted the creation and organization 

134
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,150
of the Sandinista at National Liberation
Front in 1961 if you've heard of it,

135
00:07:04,161 --> 00:07:06,620
that's probably because it's Daniel 
Ortega's movements.

136
00:07:06,621 --> 00:07:07,454
Who's the current tyrons presidents of 
Nicaragua about which we've already 

137
00:07:10,191 --> 00:07:12,320
spoken in several videos here are visual
politic.

138
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:14,350
Yup.
Let's go back to it.

139
00:07:15,890 --> 00:07:16,240
Yeah.

140
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,100
In 1969 at Carlos Fonseca moved to 
Havana where he spent the next six years

141
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:23,440
from that he organized the Sandinista 
Front.

142
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:24,333
In 1975 he returns to Nicaragua to solve
some leadership problems and unify the 

143
00:07:28,541 --> 00:07:30,340
gorilla group.
And although a year later,

144
00:07:30,341 --> 00:07:31,174
this revolutionary leader was 
assassinated in 1979 the Sandinista 

145
00:07:34,211 --> 00:07:36,070
friends,
they finally seized power.

146
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:38,810
Okay.

147
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:43,430
The gorilla trained and financed and 
supported by Havana at triumphed,

148
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:44,323
the model it worked.
So why stop in 1980 a year after the 

149
00:07:47,121 --> 00:07:49,520
Sandinista fronts triumph,
the F M N,

150
00:07:49,550 --> 00:07:50,211
l,
V,

151
00:07:50,211 --> 00:07:50,881
Pharaoh,
Buddha,

152
00:07:50,881 --> 00:07:51,714
Marty France,
fuck national liberation was founded in 

153
00:07:53,871 --> 00:07:57,260
El Salvador with Fidel Castro himself as
an intermediary.

154
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,463
What's more of this group?
It was founded in [inaudible] honor 

155
00:08:00,591 --> 00:08:01,424
itself.

156
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:05,480
Wow.

157
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:06,313
With the support of the Cuban regime,
along with that of the new Nicaraguan 

158
00:08:09,021 --> 00:08:10,490
government and Moscow,
of course,

159
00:08:10,491 --> 00:08:11,324
the f m n l started it's armed fight 
their training centers where the 

160
00:08:14,921 --> 00:08:17,480
occasion in Cuba and Nicaragua,
of course,

161
00:08:17,481 --> 00:08:20,630
it was those same countries,
which provided them with weapons,

162
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,980
supplies,
equipment,

163
00:08:22,040 --> 00:08:23,180
and anything else.
They need it.

164
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:26,020
No,

165
00:08:26,020 --> 00:08:28,070
hold on for a moment.
As you can imagine,

166
00:08:28,071 --> 00:08:28,904
the United States didn't just stand that
they weren't willing to give Havana 

167
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:33,583
another victory,
so they decided to support the 

168
00:08:35,311 --> 00:08:37,310
Salvadoran government.
Their results.

169
00:08:37,370 --> 00:08:42,020
12 years of fighting that cost more than
75,000 deaths,

170
00:08:42,170 --> 00:08:44,960
thousands more missing,
and an economic.

171
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:52,653
Now we can begin to understand the 
magnitude of the violence that has 

172
00:08:55,501 --> 00:08:59,220
destroyed so much of this region.
The fact is that on this occasion,

173
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,113
the gorillas,
they didn't achieve a revolution and 

174
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,370
after the peace agreement of 1990 they 
formed a political party.

175
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:08,160
Does any of this party governs El 
Salvador runs?

176
00:09:08,161 --> 00:09:08,994
Of course,
it hasn't hesitated to support Daniel 

177
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:11,953
Ortega's Nicaraguan regime,
but don't think for a second that this 

178
00:09:14,461 --> 00:09:17,190
situation has happened solely in Central
America,

179
00:09:17,250 --> 00:09:18,083
not at all the southern countries.
They also had that Shat South America 

180
00:09:21,091 --> 00:09:21,924
also underwent a wave of revolutionary 
movements in facts throughout Latin 

181
00:09:24,721 --> 00:09:25,554
America.
More than a hundred hundred gorilla 

182
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:28,194
groups caused enormous damage.
Almost all of them were encouraged and 

183
00:09:31,591 --> 00:09:32,424
supported by Cuba in one way or another.
That's certainly true for the most 

184
00:09:36,031 --> 00:09:37,710
famous gorilla groups.
FARC,

185
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:42,300
the April 19th movement in Colombia,
and it's the shining path in Peru,

186
00:09:43,610 --> 00:09:46,310
Shining Path.
Activists have been trained in Cuba,

187
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:49,130
Czechoslovakia and the German Democratic
Republic.

188
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,993
Manuel who law,
former prime minster of Peru and 

189
00:09:52,131 --> 00:09:55,040
statements to the bias newspaper in 1983

190
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:55,983
all you surprise now that the peace 
agreements between Fark and Juan Manuel 

191
00:09:58,870 --> 00:10:00,990
Santos is Colombian government will be 
negotiated in.

192
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,100
Yeah.

193
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:01,933
Vonda.

194
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,253
Of course these huge groups,
true army is also had another 

195
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,660
fundamental support points and that's 
drug money.

196
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:10,613
Yup.
These groups ended up becoming drug 

197
00:10:11,581 --> 00:10:12,414
traffickers business from which they 
obtained the enormous resources they 

198
00:10:15,121 --> 00:10:19,340
needed to continue the fight.
Awesome.

199
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:23,000
Don't forget that Cuba also went into 
this business we told you about that.

200
00:10:23,001 --> 00:10:23,834
Here are visual politic in a recent 
video about Nahko politics in this 

201
00:10:26,301 --> 00:10:27,860
region of the wells.
Yes.

202
00:10:27,861 --> 00:10:28,694
The Cuban government even associated 
with Pablo Escobar himself and that's 

203
00:10:32,001 --> 00:10:34,190
when it all,
the last example of Cuban infiltration,

204
00:10:34,250 --> 00:10:38,750
we all know was in Venezuela and we've 
already seen how things are giving that.

205
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,193
Okay

206
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:44,043
folks,
Cuba's influence on Latin American 

207
00:10:45,731 --> 00:10:48,400
politics in the last 60 years has been 
terrible.

208
00:10:48,460 --> 00:10:49,293
Havana has played a major role in back 
and guerrilla groups and regimes that 

209
00:10:52,061 --> 00:10:55,450
have done absolutely no good for Latin 
America.

210
00:10:55,510 --> 00:10:56,343
Yeah,
and I know nowadays some people still 

211
00:10:57,611 --> 00:11:00,250
view these groups with a certain 
romanticism,

212
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:03,760
but that really isn't mistake beyond the
feets and the myths,

213
00:11:03,761 --> 00:11:06,010
the real story,
unfortunately,

214
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,143
it's terrible,
but fortunately the gorillas are now at 

215
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:13,120
the lowest point in decades and that at 
least is good news.

216
00:11:13,150 --> 00:11:14,560
By the way.
Many of the guerrilla groups,

217
00:11:14,561 --> 00:11:17,020
they weren't just Havana's faults.
In many cases,

218
00:11:17,021 --> 00:11:17,854
they were the fault if a terribly 
extractive oligarchy that control to 

219
00:11:20,951 --> 00:11:21,784
their country with an interest in 
nothing but maintaining that own 

220
00:11:24,671 --> 00:11:25,504
privileges.
This has also been one of the great 

221
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:29,950
evils of the region.
So with this video,

222
00:11:29,951 --> 00:11:30,784
we can own fleet now better understand 
how so many guerrilla groups suddenly 

223
00:11:33,611 --> 00:11:34,444
emerged in Latin America and why 
relations between Washington and Havana 

224
00:11:37,870 --> 00:11:40,300
have traditionally been so bad.
The story,

225
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:44,110
it goes far beyond the missile crisis.
So I really hope you enjoyed that video.
