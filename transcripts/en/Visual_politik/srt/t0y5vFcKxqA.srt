1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,913
Here are the real politic.
We love talking about Asia and do you 

2
00:00:03,481 --> 00:00:04,314
probably know that by now and we like it
because there were certain things that 

3
00:00:06,571 --> 00:00:09,870
this region has the can contribute a 
loss to the improvements of all.

4
00:00:09,871 --> 00:00:10,020
Yeah.

5
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:10,853
Wow.

6
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:14,173
How was it?
Not Everything is as good as it sounds 

7
00:00:16,140 --> 00:00:16,973
it Asia.
While we can certainly see plenty of 

8
00:00:18,561 --> 00:00:19,394
lights,
there are also lots of shadows and the 

9
00:00:21,501 --> 00:00:22,334
largest shadow is that without any doubt
the area has become a huge powder keg 

10
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,170
ready to blow.
On the one hand,

11
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:31,460
the area is spending more and more in 
weapons.

12
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,353
In fact,
it is expected that by 2020 the region 

13
00:00:34,041 --> 00:00:37,850
will accounts for more than 30% of all 
of the welds military spending.

14
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:44,010
On top of that,
it's also becoming a chess board for geo

15
00:00:44,011 --> 00:00:44,844
politics.
China and India are big emerging powers 

16
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:48,524
and with time they are demanding a 
larger and larger international 

17
00:00:51,261 --> 00:00:52,094
influence.
Putin's Russia has started to feel 

18
00:00:53,571 --> 00:00:55,610
concerned by the Pacific hands.
Well,

19
00:00:55,670 --> 00:00:56,780
so as the United States,

20
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:02,850
this area is extremely important.
Now on the other hands,

21
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:03,703
there are many disagreements between the
different countries in this region and 

22
00:01:06,591 --> 00:01:11,300
it seems that lately they have been 
looking for any reason to start a fight.

23
00:01:11,330 --> 00:01:13,820
We can find all kinds of conflicts here 
back in.

24
00:01:13,821 --> 00:01:16,180
I'll make territorial historical,
I mean China,

25
00:01:16,190 --> 00:01:19,300
China's conflict with Vietnam here with 
Japan over there,

26
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,233
and then there is India.
The situation with Taiwan and the 

27
00:01:22,131 --> 00:01:22,964
problems between Japan and Russia,
that's not even considering the 

28
00:01:25,431 --> 00:01:26,264
situation in Korea.
I mean the list just grows longer and 

29
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:31,160
longer.
We own stalk about many of these,

30
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:35,690
but today we're going to focus on the 
sleeping giants and that's Japan.

31
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:38,930
Okay.

32
00:01:38,930 --> 00:01:41,270
Two nightmares of Japan.

33
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:45,730
It is the world's third largest economy,
but despite that,

34
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:46,564
this country has a modest role in 
international politics and it's been 

35
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:51,310
that way for the last few decades.
However,

36
00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:55,300
the situation is changing particularly 
for two reasons.

37
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:57,760
China and North Korea.
First,

38
00:01:57,761 --> 00:02:00,190
there is the emergence of China as a 
superpower,

39
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:03,340
but why does Japan care about that?
Well,

40
00:02:03,370 --> 00:02:04,203
basically because the emergence of China
has led to sets Max in Japan's regional 

41
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:08,824
influence.
Both countries maintain a bit of 

42
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,403
conflict.
Over a small archipelago known as the 

43
00:02:13,061 --> 00:02:14,620
Senkaku islands.

44
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:15,723
Senkaku islands are abandoned,
but they're still a key area in the 

45
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:22,160
fishing industry,
be called large deposits,

46
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,203
petrol and gas,
and there are also strategic in sea 

47
00:02:25,911 --> 00:02:26,744
trade.

48
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:27,973
Just take a look at this chart to see 
how the military budget of both 

49
00:02:30,501 --> 00:02:32,630
countries has evolved in the last few 
years.

50
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:33,493
He'll give you a better understanding of
Japan is concerned about China's 

51
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:41,291
emergent.
Second Zahn more recently there is North

52
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,493
Korea.
How's it been obsessed for the last 20 

53
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:49,900
years about developing unconventional 
walk capacities.

54
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:53,140
These are mainly being its nuclear 
capability for now.

55
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,770
North Korea has managed to create it.
Atomic bomb 30 Keela tons,

56
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,760
which is comparable,
do twice the bomb that was on her Russia

57
00:02:59,761 --> 00:03:00,594
map.
They've also succeeded in making 

58
00:03:01,451 --> 00:03:04,480
ballistic missiles which can reach not 
only South Korea.

59
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:05,940
There's also Japan.

60
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:08,443
March,
2017 North Korea launched for ballistic 

61
00:03:11,151 --> 00:03:16,151
missiles and Japan's direction it was 
successful and three out of four of them

62
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:17,323
reached Japanese territorial waters,
less than 200 miles from the Japanese 

63
00:03:21,261 --> 00:03:21,900
code

64
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:22,733
Si.

65
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,680
All of this is producing a real 
psychosis in Japan.

66
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:27,603
The Japanese government itself has 
started to conduct evacuation drills in 

67
00:03:30,311 --> 00:03:34,480
the event of a hypothetical attack and 
does either distributed a detailed guide

68
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:35,314
to explain how Japanese citizens should 
respond to to a North Korean nuclear 

69
00:03:38,801 --> 00:03:41,170
attack.
Tokyo says that people should have about

70
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:44,700
10 minutes to react to that might be an 
overestimation.

71
00:03:44,701 --> 00:03:45,534
Yeah,

72
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:47,770
Ms.
May

73
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:51,100
not be detected as soon as it leaves 
launchpad pending on the case.

74
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:51,993
The warnings and alarms might only sound
four or five minutes before a missile 

75
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,313
arrives.

76
00:03:58,050 --> 00:03:58,883
With all of this going on,
we shouldn't be surprised to find out 

77
00:04:00,481 --> 00:04:01,314
that Japan is acquiring many nuclear 
shelters as well as equipment for 

78
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,750
purifying the air,
which all designed to fight radiation as

79
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:08,280
well as poisonous gas

80
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,100
lobby the Japanese prime minister has 
confirmed.

81
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:16,450
North Korea also has the ability to 
launch serin gas missiles,

82
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:19,550
so ignoring whether the North Korean 
threat is real on us.

83
00:04:19,551 --> 00:04:24,350
The reality is that China and North 
Korea are perceived as being significant

84
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:25,184
threats by Tokyo before explaining how 
the country is planning to fight these 

85
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:29,714
threats.
Let's have a look at what has been the 

86
00:04:31,251 --> 00:04:34,490
foundation of their defense policy in 
the last few decades.

87
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:41,360
Pat a passivist country,

88
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,010
Japan was one of the countries that lost
World War II.

89
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:46,933
As a consequence of this defeats the 
country had to establish a constitution 

90
00:04:49,971 --> 00:04:54,971
in 1940 700 that constitution is still 
enforced today in this constitution.

91
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,143
It states that war and the use of force 
is not to be used unless in self 

92
00:04:59,751 --> 00:05:00,584
defense.

93
00:05:01,010 --> 00:05:06,010
Firing sincerely to an international 
piece based on justice and order.

94
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,213
The Japanese people forever renounced 
war as a sovereign right of the nation 

95
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,910
in order to accomplish the aim of the 
preceding paragraph,

96
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,200
land,
sea,

97
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:20,260
and air forces as well as other war 
potential will never be maintained.

98
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:23,120
Article Nine of the Japanese 
Constitution.

99
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,310
This means that at first the idea was 
that Japan couldn't even have an army.

100
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,090
The country protection was the 
responsibility of the u s however,

101
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:35,290
the Korean War and the tensions suffered
during the years of the Cold War changed

102
00:05:35,291 --> 00:05:36,580
everything.
All of a sudden,

103
00:05:36,581 --> 00:05:37,414
both Tokyo as well as Washington 
understood it was essential to form a 

104
00:05:40,241 --> 00:05:41,074
support force for the American army.
In case Japan and needed defense and 

105
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,410
that is how the Japanese self defense 
forces were born.

106
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,280
This is an army whose only possible 
purpose is defense,

107
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,173
but one thing is tree.
Formerly the U s still takes cat of 

108
00:05:55,301 --> 00:05:58,250
Japan's protection and keeps more than 
40,000

109
00:05:58,251 --> 00:05:59,084
soldiers deployed in the country and 
also maintains some of its largest 

110
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:04,580
military bases in Japan.
This is a forced,

111
00:06:04,581 --> 00:06:07,010
by the way,
that is co financed by the government of

112
00:06:07,011 --> 00:06:07,844
Japan itself.
We could even say the Japan is the 

113
00:06:09,651 --> 00:06:12,740
largest spearhead of the U S in Asia.
However,

114
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,640
the new threats Japan perceives in the 
region from China runs North Korea,

115
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:17,503
of course,
Japan's and no longer be satisfied with 

116
00:06:19,071 --> 00:06:19,904
this protection.
So the big question is how is Japan 

117
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,780
responding to these threats?

118
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:29,080
Are these new diplomacy?

119
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:31,063
It's the beginning with the Japanese 
Prime Minister Shinzo all they has 

120
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:33,983
started an unusual diplomatic race who 
work against the growing influence of 

121
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:38,010
China.
For now,

122
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:38,893
he has managed to improve the country's 
relations with South Korea and to 

123
00:06:41,221 --> 00:06:42,054
strengthen its bonds with the u s and 
even bridge the gap existing with 

124
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:45,840
Putin's Russia.

125
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:46,803
Japan maintains an intense dispute over 
the sovereignty of a small archipelago 

126
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:52,203
known as the Kuril islands,
which Russia claims is now under their 

127
00:06:55,091 --> 00:06:55,840
sovereignty.

128
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:57,290
In fact,
the diplomacy are,

129
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,124
they has started is so intense that the 
country is now competing with China in 

130
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:02,313
Africa,

131
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:05,430
Japan and China Compete for African 
market.

132
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:06,793
I'm just a curious fact.
Shinzo all bay was also the first 

133
00:07:08,631 --> 00:07:09,464
international leader to meet with trump 
and the famous residents the American 

134
00:07:12,201 --> 00:07:13,034
President owns in Florida.
It seems like after this encounter all 

135
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:17,704
bay manage,
do you win over the president's and 

136
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,544
Macon?
Forget all the attacks made against 

137
00:07:20,871 --> 00:07:25,490
Japan when he was still a candidate for 
the presidency because one thing is true

138
00:07:25,550 --> 00:07:28,570
from complained quite a lot about Japan,
but you know,

139
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,690
things can change.

140
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:35,210
Made it to the security of Japan and all
areas under its administrative control.

141
00:07:35,270 --> 00:07:38,420
The friendship between our two peoples 
runs a very,

142
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:39,530
very deep,

143
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,530
of course diplomacy is not always enough

144
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,740
and we are.

145
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:52,350
And so finally we reached the key 
points.

146
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:53,213
The Japanese Self Defense Forces often 
thought of as some sort of small bands 

147
00:07:56,401 --> 00:07:57,234
of men,
but really nothing is further from the 

148
00:07:58,981 --> 00:07:59,814
truth.
The Japanese army is larger than the 

149
00:08:01,261 --> 00:08:04,170
army of France and the UK combined.

150
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:07,830
No,
it is true that given their name,

151
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:09,690
you may not think that they are 
important,

152
00:08:09,691 --> 00:08:12,450
but the abilities and capacity of this 
stream,

153
00:08:12,451 --> 00:08:15,300
Jami is impressive.
Many analysts,

154
00:08:15,301 --> 00:08:17,460
they are still the best army in all of 
Asia,

155
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:20,750
although China certainly competes for 
that top spot antidote.

156
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:25,080
Japan's investment in defense is quite 
low with less than 1% of its GDP,

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,260
but that is still a lot of money.
Take a look at this.

158
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,090
In 2016 Japan was the country with the 
seventh highest spending on defense.

159
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:34,013
In 2017 the governments will give,
the force is the largest budget in its 

160
00:08:37,591 --> 00:08:40,110
history,
more than 5 trillion yen,

161
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,880
which is around $45 billion and of 
course such a quantity in such a small,

162
00:08:44,881 --> 00:08:45,714
and by the way,
very well trained army is enough for 

163
00:08:47,281 --> 00:08:50,490
them to acquire some of the most modern 
systems available.

164
00:08:50,550 --> 00:08:51,383
For example,
there's the f 35 the best American 

165
00:08:53,011 --> 00:08:54,870
drones,
the Zulu Pass aircraft,

166
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,200
or even the new fifth generation fighter
jets,

167
00:08:58,230 --> 00:08:59,750
which Mitsibushi is developing.

168
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,140
Japan reveals the prototype of it's 
splashed furtive fighters.

169
00:09:04,290 --> 00:09:05,123
The thing is that since all they became 
prime minister in 2012 he has had to 

170
00:09:08,001 --> 00:09:08,834
declare idea of leaving behind the 
pacifist character sent by the Japanese 

171
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:14,573
Constitution Ams.
This has happened in 2014 the Chinese 

172
00:09:16,231 --> 00:09:17,064
government decided to stop all 
restrictions on the export of warfare 

173
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:20,663
material with the goal of starting a new
Japanese military industry a bit later 

174
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,224
in 2015 are they all say ladder reform.
So for the self defense forces could 

175
00:09:28,951 --> 00:09:33,951
operate abroad and today they even have 
a military base in Djibouti brands.

176
00:09:35,531 --> 00:09:37,620
Of course the military budget has 
increased again,

177
00:09:37,621 --> 00:09:40,260
often many years of budget cuts,
but not only this,

178
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:43,590
they aren't even thinking about changing
the constitution.

179
00:09:44,730 --> 00:09:49,730
The radical military shift of Japan 
echoes the ghost of World War Two so now

180
00:09:51,541 --> 00:09:53,940
it comes to the point in the video where
we ask what you think.

181
00:09:53,941 --> 00:09:56,370
Do you think Japan should leave?
It's pacifism aside,

182
00:09:56,490 --> 00:09:59,090
should Japan given to Beijing?
Which country?

183
00:09:59,091 --> 00:10:02,220
He seems like a better ally for you.
Japan or China?

184
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:03,203
