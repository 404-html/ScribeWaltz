1
00:00:14,100 --> 00:00:14,933
It seems to be in the Korean Peninsula,
the drums of war are constantly 

2
00:00:18,691 --> 00:00:19,524
rumbling,
certainly true that this area is not 

3
00:00:27,471 --> 00:00:28,304
known for its peacefulness,
but the kind of tension that the area 

4
00:00:30,441 --> 00:00:33,530
has been recently feeling has not 
existed for some time.

5
00:00:33,560 --> 00:00:34,393
The United States,
the country which already had 30,000 

6
00:00:36,231 --> 00:00:37,064
soldiers deployed in the area,
has also deployed several aircraft 

7
00:00:39,681 --> 00:00:40,970
carriers,
heavy bombers,

8
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,880
and even advanced anti missile system in
South Korea.

9
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:44,743
It is so advanced that China has even 
considered it a threat to their own 

10
00:00:48,081 --> 00:00:48,914
security,

11
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,600
trying to tells us to remove antimissile
key h,

12
00:00:52,601 --> 00:00:56,030
a d system from South Korea amid spying 
fears.

13
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,143
North Korea on the other hand,
keeps carrying out a new tests with 

14
00:00:59,521 --> 00:01:02,880
ballistic missiles and is progressing 
with its nuclear program.

15
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,743
It seems that North Korea doesn't really
care about all the international 

16
00:01:06,361 --> 00:01:09,930
legislation about nonproliferation and 
nuclear testing.

17
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:13,590
Japan and South Korea are feeling 
understandably temps.

18
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,453
They want to know what to do,
what decisions to make step by step in 

19
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:20,130
order to stop the growing threat.
That is Kim Jong.

20
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:22,230
UHM,
North Korea.

21
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,720
His most recent missile launch is 
absolutely intolerable.

22
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:27,693
You'll need to take a stand.
We already told you in a previous video 

23
00:01:29,941 --> 00:01:30,774
here at visual politic about how Japan 
is seriously considering putting an end 

24
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:35,034
to the pacifists nature of their 
constitution and it seems that right 

25
00:01:37,651 --> 00:01:40,020
now,
even Beijing has had enough of Pyongyang

26
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:42,053
quarterly,
sent a 150,000 troops to North Korea's 

27
00:01:43,951 --> 00:01:44,784
border.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,713
If this story were a movie,
I'd probably leave the center and 

29
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:51,180
thinking that the writer had taken too 
much creative liberty

30
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:52,133
dynamic.

31
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:03,640
What is really happening in this region?
What can we actually expect?

32
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:05,830
Well,
that's what we're going to talk about in

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,700
this visual politic video,
but before we get into all of that,

34
00:02:09,730 --> 00:02:10,563
let's get some perspective.
Where are we and how did we get to the 

35
00:02:18,651 --> 00:02:23,380
situation in North Korea is some sort of
nightmare from the past.

36
00:02:23,381 --> 00:02:24,214
It's a country still living in the cold 
water country with one of the most 

37
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:31,120
totalitarian governments in the world,
and along with all of that,

38
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:34,840
it's also one of the poorest countries 
on the planet.

39
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:39,370
According to the United Nations.
Two out of five North Korean suffer from

40
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,590
undernourishment buckskin.
Joe [inaudible],

41
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:44,410
the guy who controls the country with an
iron fist,

42
00:02:44,411 --> 00:02:48,200
doesn't seem to give a damn about any of
that site.

43
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,233
It is estimated the Pyongyang started to
develop its nuclear program around the 

44
00:02:52,451 --> 00:02:53,284
19 eighties and since then there have 
been a few key situations which have 

45
00:02:56,831 --> 00:02:59,020
sped up this progress.
The first was the fall,

46
00:02:59,110 --> 00:02:59,943
the Soviet Union in 1991.
Then game George W dot Bush's 

47
00:03:03,070 --> 00:03:07,820
incorporation of North Korea into these 
so called axis of evil in 2002.

48
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:12,280
Then the was the coming to power of Kim 
Jong EU in 2011.

49
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:15,280
We could say that every time the regime 
felt threatened,

50
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:18,240
they decided to accelerate the process.
Bob,

51
00:03:18,250 --> 00:03:20,340
so we're going to discuss that later in 
the video.

52
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:22,633
The issue is today,
it is estimated that North Korea holds 

53
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:29,270
from 10 to 20 nuclear weapons and 
according to the Rand Corporation,

54
00:03:29,330 --> 00:03:30,163
if it doesn't stop producing them,
the North Korean program could 

55
00:03:32,031 --> 00:03:34,790
accumulate around 100 nuclear bombs by 
the year 20,

56
00:03:34,791 --> 00:03:35,624
20.

57
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:39,800
But do you wait for just a second 
because this isn't the end of the story,

58
00:03:39,830 --> 00:03:42,740
but now the technology used in this 
country as well?

59
00:03:42,770 --> 00:03:43,603
It's pretty basic.
It's based on old designs from the 

60
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,503
Soviet Union,
so the bombs they have developed up 

61
00:03:48,171 --> 00:03:50,060
until now,
they don't work.

62
00:03:50,061 --> 00:03:50,790
Brilliant.

63
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:51,623
Yeah.

64
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:58,150
That is why Pyongyang is now obsessed 
with two things.

65
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,013
On the one hand,
attempting to miniaturize the bombs so 

66
00:04:01,151 --> 00:04:01,984
they can be placed in missiles.
On the other hand is developing 

67
00:04:06,101 --> 00:04:06,934
ballistic missiles capable of attacking 
targets that all thousands of miles 

68
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:11,134
away.
The last tests they've conducted 

69
00:04:12,701 --> 00:04:16,120
indicate that they are probably making 
some important advances.

70
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:18,813
Many analysts,
including the intelligence services of 

71
00:04:20,591 --> 00:04:21,424
South Korea and the United States have 
considered the North Korea is already 

72
00:04:24,551 --> 00:04:25,384
capable of weaponizing short and mid 
range missiles with nuclear warheads 

73
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:31,420
which could allow them to reach South 
Korea and Japan.

74
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,113
That's not all.
It seems clear that if the program 

75
00:04:35,621 --> 00:04:39,610
doesn't stop in a few years,
North Korea will be capable of attacking

76
00:04:39,611 --> 00:04:42,520
the United States of America with 
ballistic missiles.

77
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:47,550
This would be a significant strategic 
leap for North Korea and that difference

78
00:04:47,591 --> 00:04:51,070
is a red line.
Which is causing the Pentagon many,

79
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
many headaches.
So now you might be wondering,

80
00:04:59,721 --> 00:05:01,910
well,
hasn't the US done anything to stop this

81
00:05:01,911 --> 00:05:05,780
country as well?
The truth is that they have tried almost

82
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:06,703
every

83
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:11,183
us strategy.

84
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,540
Yes,

85
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,373
the United States and South Korea have 
trying to persuade Pyongyang to abandon 

86
00:05:17,591 --> 00:05:20,470
that plan of developing nuclear weapons 
and well,

87
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:24,280
they didn't have any problem taking out 
a checkbook in order to do this

88
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,930
in the early nineties,
1994 to be specific,

89
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,070
Bill Clinton signed the agreement 
framework by which North Korea committed

90
00:05:32,071 --> 00:05:32,904
to cancel it's military plans in 
exchange for generous fueled help from 

91
00:05:36,091 --> 00:05:36,924
the United States,
as well as assistance to build two 

92
00:05:38,911 --> 00:05:42,350
nuclear reactors for civilian use.
With this disagreements,

93
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:46,420
North Korea obtains the energy they 
needed to develop that economy.

94
00:05:46,510 --> 00:05:47,343
As for South Korea,
besides giving a huge amount of 

95
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:52,690
humanitarian aid,
they also committed to boost and finance

96
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:55,360
North Korea's economic development 
programs.

97
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:58,070
It all seem to be going well for a 
while.

98
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,350
However,
it all fills pieces in 2002.

99
00:06:00,351 --> 00:06:01,184
When George W dot Bush founds out that 
Pyongyang had been fooling them in 

100
00:06:04,401 --> 00:06:05,234
secret North Korea at kept developing 
its nuclear programs for military 

101
00:06:08,810 --> 00:06:10,760
purposes.
After more negotiations,

102
00:06:10,761 --> 00:06:11,594
they reached a new agreements and Bush's
administration restarted their age 

103
00:06:14,871 --> 00:06:17,990
program and lifted sanctions spots.
A year later,

104
00:06:17,991 --> 00:06:21,380
Pyongyang reneged on the deal.
Despite all of this,

105
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:26,381
Barack Obama decided to try yet again in
February 2012,

106
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:30,200
they reach a new agreement.
North Korea canceled the nuclear program

107
00:06:30,230 --> 00:06:33,200
and the United States restarted once 
again the economic game.

108
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:36,440
This time Pyongyang broke the agreement 
only six weeks later.

109
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:38,603
All right,
so now you're beginning to get the 

110
00:06:39,981 --> 00:06:41,720
picture.
So now you might be wondering,

111
00:06:41,721 --> 00:06:43,310
well,
why a North Korea?

112
00:06:43,311 --> 00:06:46,070
So insistence on having nuclear weapons 
at all,

113
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:53,773
what are each looking for?
The regime of Kim Jong UN is pretty set 

114
00:06:58,260 --> 00:06:59,093
on developing more advanced nuclear 
weapons and the international community 

115
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,024
is going to have to get used to the idea
that this is not something they are 

116
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:06,984
going to abandon,
but that still leaves us with the 

117
00:07:08,971 --> 00:07:10,500
question of why.
Well,

118
00:07:10,501 --> 00:07:11,334
first of all,
because they think that nuclear weapons 

119
00:07:12,541 --> 00:07:13,374
are essential for the survival.
Young young knows that with nuclear 

120
00:07:16,021 --> 00:07:19,350
weapons around no foreign power,
especially the United States,

121
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,390
would dat intervene in the country

122
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,770
when the United States invaded Iraq,
North Korean leaders,

123
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:27,663
they were paying attention,
but then the first mistake Saddam 

124
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:33,790
Hussein made was not having nuclear 
weapons and other wmds.

125
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,310
They thought the same thing.
When Gaddafi's regime fell,

126
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,173
there'd be a voluntarily canceled it's 
program for the development of wmds a 

127
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,143
few years earlier,

128
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:47,250
so the North Korean leadership thinks,
and so honestly that probably right,

129
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:51,090
that nuclear weapons are the best 
guarantee to staying in power.

130
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,953
Further,
the sales of nuclear weapons technology 

131
00:07:53,551 --> 00:07:54,384
is one of the main sources of foreign 
currency coming into the country 

132
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,380
currency that's needed so the elite can 
maintain their standards of living since

133
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:02,214
the fall of the Soviet Union.
North Korea has become one of the main 

134
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,700
exporters of missile equipment 
technology and components.

135
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,600
USC says North Korean ship taking 
missiles to Yemen.

136
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,033
Also,
indications are that North Korea has 

137
00:08:15,211 --> 00:08:16,044
sold nuclear technology to Iran and 
advised Syria in the construction of a 

138
00:08:19,591 --> 00:08:20,424
nuclear reactor that Israel bombarded in
2007 is really strike targeted Syrian 

139
00:08:25,741 --> 00:08:27,540
nuclear reactor.
The Telegraph,

140
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,000
it is precisely this risk of 
proliferation,

141
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:33,990
which is why the United States is trying
so hard to stop North Korea.

142
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,430
The other reason is,
of course,

143
00:08:35,431 --> 00:08:36,264
do you try to prevent this country from 
being capable of threatening the United 

144
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,193
States with a nuclear attack so well now
we come to China and what China thinks 

145
00:08:44,191 --> 00:08:45,030
of all of this

146
00:08:48,470 --> 00:08:50,100
China.
One

147
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,933
thing is if it weren't for trying to 
support North Korea would have never 

148
00:08:54,061 --> 00:08:54,894
developed its nuclear and it isn't just 
the technological part that we're 

149
00:08:57,871 --> 00:09:01,440
talking about here or the support to 
avoid international penalties.

150
00:09:01,470 --> 00:09:02,303
It's also the money trying to accounts 
for more than 90 percent of North 

151
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,000
Korea's total trade daily and k.
In other words,

152
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,110
without the support of Beijing,
this country,

153
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:13,830
it would have collapsed a long time ago.
However,

154
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:15,750
there are some signs which tell us 
China,

155
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:16,613
well,
they're a bit tied up so much 

156
00:09:17,281 --> 00:09:20,850
provocation because they're not happy 
about this nuclear missiles either.

157
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,713
It could be said for Beijing killing 
Yang is now a burden that China has to 

158
00:09:24,991 --> 00:09:25,824
deal with as it attempts to gain 
influence and leadership in 

159
00:09:27,841 --> 00:09:32,100
international politics.
Trying to take the driver's seat on free

160
00:09:32,101 --> 00:09:32,934
trade.
Some analysts have even suggested the 

161
00:09:34,871 --> 00:09:37,950
Beijing might be losing control over the
government of Pyongyang,

162
00:09:38,010 --> 00:09:41,580
which is now self absorbed by then new 
nuclear capability.

163
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:44,700
Importantly,
for the first time in November of 2006,

164
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,534
China agreed to completely stick with 
the international sanctions being 

165
00:09:48,361 --> 00:09:51,090
leveled against North Korea.
Besides in the last few months.

166
00:09:51,091 --> 00:09:55,410
China is forbid a North Korean coal 
imports and gas exports and weld.

167
00:09:55,411 --> 00:09:57,840
The international community is holding 
its breath.

168
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,630
That is a significant punishments that 
Kim Jong,

169
00:10:00,690 --> 00:10:01,523
Uhm,
regime ams wealth is more international 

170
00:10:03,541 --> 00:10:07,080
relations between these two countries is
not at its best points.

171
00:10:07,090 --> 00:10:09,210
In fact,
since Kim Jong Un women came to power,

172
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,300
no top level bilateral meetings have 
taken place.

173
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:15,750
And now less and less official visits 
between the countries.

174
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,613
So the question is,
is Beijing really changing its 

175
00:10:18,811 --> 00:10:20,610
relationship with Pyong Yang?

176
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,500
Yeah,

177
00:10:24,610 --> 00:10:25,750
a road to solution.

178
00:10:28,490 --> 00:10:31,790
It is still to seemed tonight,
but don't be fooled for the time being.

179
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:34,670
China is not going to let North Korea 
fall,

180
00:10:34,760 --> 00:10:37,190
which is still an ally for them in the 
region,

181
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,250
at least not until they have serious 
reasons to do so.

182
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,593
That is a key point to understand.
If we want to find a solution to this 

183
00:10:44,391 --> 00:10:45,224
crisis,
China needs to be persuaded to try and 

184
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:47,834
make Pyongyang put an end to this,
cancel their nuclear program and carry 

185
00:10:51,111 --> 00:10:51,944
out real reforms,
but that winds happen under the current 

186
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,113
setup.
That is why many experts think it is 

187
00:10:56,451 --> 00:10:57,284
time for the United States to withdraw 
from Korea and consider dismantling the 

188
00:11:00,801 --> 00:11:05,120
anti missile system and perhaps consider
some economic compensation as well.

189
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,013
It is also important that China 
understands that the current situation 

190
00:11:08,751 --> 00:11:09,584
might need South Korea and Japan to 
pursue an arms race as well as the 

191
00:11:12,381 --> 00:11:15,320
option of developing that own nuclear 
weapons.

192
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,183
So now we've told you our opinion here

So what do you think trump's 
administration should do?

196
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:28,370
Do you think North Korea should put an 
end to its nuclear plans?

197
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:30,770
Should they even possibly be threatened 
with war?
