1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,050
[inaudible]

2
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:08,853
on the 1st of July,
visio Canada celebrated it's 150th 

3
00:00:12,101 --> 00:00:12,934
birthday.
Now we told you all about this in a 

4
00:00:14,111 --> 00:00:18,130
previous video where we also showed you 
some of the keys as Dwight Canada is one

5
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,060
of the most admired countries in the 
entire wells,

6
00:00:21,110 --> 00:00:21,943
kinda instability to into 10 provinces 
and three territories just have so many 

7
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:26,434
unique regulations that in 2017 they 
actually had to sign a free trade 

8
00:00:29,891 --> 00:00:31,330
agreement among them.
However,

9
00:00:31,420 --> 00:00:34,570
even though this country is turns 150 in
perfect shape,

10
00:00:34,571 --> 00:00:37,030
Canada is also facing problems.
Faye,

11
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:37,923
social,
political and economic threats that 

12
00:00:39,491 --> 00:00:41,020
could be considered.
Well,

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:44,650
pretty serious indeed because as you 
probably already know,

14
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:47,290
well,
unfortunately nothing is perfect.

15
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:48,153
So in a previous video who's link I'll 
leave at the end of this video as well 

16
00:00:50,771 --> 00:00:51,604
as in the description below.
We looked on the bright side of things 

17
00:00:54,461 --> 00:00:57,400
and Canada ended up looking pretty darn 
wonderful.

18
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,383
But in this video we're going to discuss
the main problems and threats that are 

19
00:01:01,451 --> 00:01:03,850
affecting Canada and well the first of 
them,

20
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:08,880
it's got a lot to do with this 150th 
anniversary birthday.

21
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:18,611
Somehow artificial Canadians not even 
close,

22
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,053
celebrated this 150th birthday.
We can find several different reasons 

23
00:01:24,301 --> 00:01:26,040
why,
but in order to explain them,

24
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,600
we should first tell you about what 
happens 150 years ago,

25
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:31,493
so that's jumped back in time all the 
way to 1867 on the 1st of July of that 

26
00:01:36,571 --> 00:01:37,404
year.
The territory was still a part of the 

27
00:01:38,671 --> 00:01:39,504
British empire,
but it was on this day for the first 

28
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:44,160
British North America Act was signed.

29
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:50,830
The British North America Act of 1867 
was a law that united the three colonial

30
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:53,920
provinces of New Brunswick,
new Scotland and Canada,

31
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:56,470
which is divided up into Ontario and 
Quebec.

32
00:01:56,471 --> 00:01:57,304
That very same day into the 
Confederation of Canada of these four 

33
00:02:02,571 --> 00:02:03,404
provinces,
which still counts quite a loss of 

34
00:02:04,431 --> 00:02:07,010
autonomy.
A federal government was organized to to

35
00:02:07,011 --> 00:02:10,220
give them some cohesion above this 
government's,

36
00:02:10,221 --> 00:02:15,221
there was still the British authorities.
Thanks to this day,

37
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:18,660
Canada is still a monarchy and Queen 
Elizabeth.

38
00:02:18,661 --> 00:02:21,600
The second is still the head of state.
Also Bams,

39
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:22,434
although it might sound surprising,
Canada didn't have to till independence 

40
00:02:24,781 --> 00:02:28,440
from the UK until very recently.
1982 in fact,

41
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,333
that's right.
Something's on 1982 any constitutional 

42
00:02:31,081 --> 00:02:34,440
modification required to the approval of
the British parliament.

43
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,873
So as you can probably see from this,
that law in 1867 it didn't result in a 

44
00:02:40,091 --> 00:02:43,130
completely independent country bus Dev 
you is.

45
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:44,283
That's not the ends of it.
There are more reasons why Canadians 

46
00:02:47,441 --> 00:02:51,160
dislike this day.
The most important of these is that when

47
00:02:51,161 --> 00:02:52,780
the settlers arrived,
Canada,

48
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,300
well,
it wasn't an empty lands

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,320
first nations,
the inuits and the,

50
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,243
yeah,

51
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,120
it's 1.5 million inhabitants said 
nothing to celebrate last July and those

52
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,820
inhabitants my own v within natives of 
Canada,

53
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,100
it's a celebration of the worst 150 
years up indigenous peoples lives.

54
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,760
Don't think of this as only a historical
problem.

55
00:03:22,761 --> 00:03:24,920
The recognition and integration of these
people's,

56
00:03:24,921 --> 00:03:28,250
it continues to this day to be a 
national problem.

57
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:30,230
In fact,
the government of Justin Trudeau,

58
00:03:30,231 --> 00:03:31,064
it hasn't made it a priority.
Consider all the prime minister had to 

59
00:03:33,021 --> 00:03:33,854
say on the 21st of June of this year.
No relationship is more important to 

60
00:03:37,911 --> 00:03:38,744
Canada.
Then the relationship with the 

61
00:03:39,531 --> 00:03:41,660
indigenous peoples,
Justin Trudeau.

62
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,340
Oh,
you might be wondering,

63
00:03:43,390 --> 00:03:45,100
Hey,
all these groups sounds,

64
00:03:45,110 --> 00:03:48,200
what has happened to them over the last 
150 years?

65
00:03:49,790 --> 00:03:50,623
Yeah.

66
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:56,190
According to the Canadian constitution,
there were three large groups.

67
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:59,490
The first nations made of more than 600 
native communities.

68
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:01,343
The inuits,
the people of the Arctic and the 

69
00:04:03,211 --> 00:04:04,044
methods,
the result of mixing natives with the 

70
00:04:05,611 --> 00:04:06,444
new settlers.

71
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:10,900
Canada was not an empty land.
When the settlers arrived,

72
00:04:10,901 --> 00:04:11,734
it's actually estimated that there were 
around 500,000 people from these needs 

73
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:15,454
of communities who signed the agreements
with the British and the French 

74
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:18,874
authorities.
They even participated in the battles 

75
00:04:20,741 --> 00:04:22,840
that protected the independence of 
Canada.

76
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:24,273
Canada would be American today,
if not for the Indian allies who fought 

77
00:04:27,221 --> 00:04:28,600
for the crown.
Peter Russell.

78
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,523
Oh yes.
The U s really did try to invade Canada 

79
00:04:31,541 --> 00:04:32,860
more than once.
While.

80
00:04:32,861 --> 00:04:33,694
The problem is that despite his being 
the first people in this land and 

81
00:04:35,351 --> 00:04:36,184
despite the fact that they participated 
and contributed to the independence of 

82
00:04:39,281 --> 00:04:40,114
the country,
the natives suffered a clear cultural 

83
00:04:42,251 --> 00:04:42,890
pass,
a key.

84
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,723
Oh Shit.

85
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,450
Yup.
As a result of that obsession,

86
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,303
somehow to create a homogenous and 
national identities kind of just went 

87
00:04:53,711 --> 00:04:56,560
through a period of persecuting the 
natives.

88
00:04:56,561 --> 00:04:57,394
For years,
these people suffered the occupation of 

89
00:04:58,901 --> 00:05:01,240
their territories and were sent away to 
reservations,

90
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,103
which sometimes didn't even have the 
basic conditions that would allow for 

91
00:05:04,871 --> 00:05:06,220
their survival.
Furthermore,

92
00:05:06,221 --> 00:05:07,054
both their language and their cultural 
and religious rituals where sometimes 

93
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,714
forbidden this persecution,
it reached such a point that the 

94
00:05:12,761 --> 00:05:17,380
authority set up a system of residences 
and boarding schools for the children of

95
00:05:17,381 --> 00:05:18,214
native families.
The government took the children from 

96
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:20,884
the families and sending them to schools
where they would receive an education 

97
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:24,423
which was fully western so that they 
could lose all aspects of that cultural 

98
00:05:27,671 --> 00:05:30,250
identity.
Tens of thousands of children,

99
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:31,270
they were educated in

100
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,163
this way

101
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,233
and these schools,
they continued until the 1970s and the 

102
00:05:40,791 --> 00:05:43,490
consequences,
they still have to be dealt with today.

103
00:05:43,491 --> 00:05:45,200
Poverty rates are much higher than 
average.

104
00:05:45,201 --> 00:05:47,600
There are many broken families.
Depression is rampant.

105
00:05:47,870 --> 00:05:50,660
Alcoholism and suicide rates are higher 
than average.

106
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:57,553
Yeah.

107
00:05:58,210 --> 00:05:59,043
All the consequences,
all of this sorts of persecution along 

108
00:06:01,031 --> 00:06:04,420
with these at racism and exclusion,
we're also very normal.

109
00:06:07,150 --> 00:06:07,983
Sorry.

110
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:10,640
In 2008 the prime minister at the time,
Stephen Harper,

111
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:14,850
apologized to these people's for the 
atrocities and established the truth and

112
00:06:14,851 --> 00:06:16,730
Reconciliation Commission.
Sure.

113
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:17,633
Speaker,
I stand before you today to offer an 

114
00:06:19,471 --> 00:06:23,640
apology to former students of Indian 
residential schools.

115
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:25,133
The treatment of children in Indian 
residential schools is a sad chapter in 

116
00:06:29,671 --> 00:06:30,504
our history.
They've also paid hundreds of millions 

117
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:36,280
of dollars in reparations.
That money can't fix all these problems.

118
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,710
Even today,
Canada is still looking for the best way

119
00:06:38,711 --> 00:06:41,290
to move forward from this dark period of
its history,

120
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,860
but now let's step back forward to the 
present day and look at the relationship

121
00:06:44,861 --> 00:06:47,650
between Canada and the u s oh well more.
Absolutely.

122
00:06:47,651 --> 00:06:49,030
Canada and president

123
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:52,170
from [inaudible].

124
00:06:54,230 --> 00:06:55,370
The breakup threat

125
00:06:58,190 --> 00:07:01,340
is very dependent on its relationship 
with the United States.

126
00:07:01,341 --> 00:07:02,174
They are so dependent that we could 
almost say that the Canadians would be 

127
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:07,010
unable to live without best southern 
neighbor.

128
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,903
Indeed,
almost 70% of Canadian trade is bound 

129
00:07:10,671 --> 00:07:11,504
for the United States,
but at the industrial sector of both 

130
00:07:13,971 --> 00:07:16,190
countries,
it's strongly interconnected.

131
00:07:16,250 --> 00:07:17,083
So this is a special relationship and 
this is something Justin Trudeau knows 

132
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:23,240
indeed.
He said so in his campaign,

133
00:07:23,241 --> 00:07:24,074
and as soon as he reached power,
the concentrated is international 

134
00:07:26,411 --> 00:07:30,530
affairs and to improving Canada's 
relationship with the United States.

135
00:07:30,590 --> 00:07:33,320
And so truth be told is the relationship
that he built with Obama.

136
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:43,360
Thank you again for your leadership and 
your friendship.

137
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:48,790
I know that our two countries can 
achieve great things by working together

138
00:07:48,791 --> 00:07:53,110
as allies and as friends as we have done
so many times

139
00:07:53,170 --> 00:07:54,003
before.

140
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,090
There's some things we will probably 
never agree on who's beer is better,

141
00:08:06,010 --> 00:08:07,000
who's better at hockey?

142
00:08:12,150 --> 00:08:16,740
Trump's in office and is pursuing a 
policy of protectionism Canada.

143
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:20,610
What they've done to our dairy farm 
workers is a disgrace.

144
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:22,013
It's a disgrace.
And so what did the Canadian government 

145
00:08:24,241 --> 00:08:24,900
do?
Well,

146
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:25,733
they set up something of a war room.
This was an office dedicated to 

147
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:31,680
following all the movements of the new 
administration in Washington.

148
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:32,543
At first,
the strategy of Trudeau and his people 

149
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:34,554
was buttering up the American 
government's and is it kind of looked 

150
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:38,940
like it was working.
The Canadian Prime Minister even started

151
00:08:38,941 --> 00:08:42,510
a friendship with Ivanka trump.
Trump's daughter Justin Trudeau,

152
00:08:42,511 --> 00:08:45,870
brings Ivanka trump to Broadway show on 
welcoming outsiders.

153
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,913
As you can imagine,
this opened the door to all sorts of 

154
00:08:49,231 --> 00:08:50,064
wild rumors and speculation.
The thing is they got on well and both 

155
00:08:53,311 --> 00:08:54,144
have led a seminar on women in business.
Donald Trump himself mentioned in a 

156
00:08:57,101 --> 00:09:01,290
speech to Congress with the help of 
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

157
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:04,530
We have formed a council with our 
neighbors and Canada to help ensure that

158
00:09:04,531 --> 00:09:06,960
women entrepreneurs have access to the 
networks,

159
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:07,853
markets and capital they need to start a
business and live out their financial 

160
00:09:10,861 --> 00:09:13,020
dreams.
Donald Trump.

161
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,340
All right.
I say this was all great.

162
00:09:14,341 --> 00:09:19,130
It seemed to be working really well.
Bob's then all of a sudden trump attacks

163
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,973
and accused Canada rather.
I've done expectedly of unfair 

164
00:09:22,441 --> 00:09:25,540
competition.
Something that he also did with Mexico,

165
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:26,374
right?

166
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:29,403
It would be really dangerous,
but Canada to suffer a restriction on 

167
00:09:31,451 --> 00:09:32,284
trade relations with the u s government 
in Ottawa decided to start these so 

168
00:09:35,711 --> 00:09:36,544
called a doughnut strategy consisting of
influencing all institutions around the 

169
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:41,583
White House,
which would be considered as being in 

170
00:09:42,491 --> 00:09:47,380
the center of that hole of the day.
The question it now becomes,

171
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,260
will they achieve that goal?
No.

172
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,113
Lead time will say,
the first challenge is to renegotiate 

173
00:09:51,881 --> 00:09:54,100
Nafta as trump has demand it.
Now,

174
00:09:54,101 --> 00:09:54,934
next step,
we need to consider another essential 

175
00:09:55,961 --> 00:09:58,740
crisis that could threaten Canadian 
prosperity.

176
00:10:01,550 --> 00:10:02,150
Okay.

177
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:03,260
Real estate bubble.

178
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:04,733
Hmm.

179
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:09,030
Prices and Canada's housing market,
they have absolutely skyrocketed.

180
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:13,320
They've increased 76% and so have the 
loans that banks are providing.

181
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,333
Indeed it.
Family debt in Canada is now among the 

182
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,200
highest in the world.
Have a look at this chart.

183
00:10:19,201 --> 00:10:21,370
Do you see the increase in Canadian real
estate prices?

184
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,360
And then we'll

185
00:10:25,750 --> 00:10:26,810
what's considered family.

186
00:10:30,570 --> 00:10:32,360
But as you

187
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,400
measuring this is set off all sorts of 
economic alarms.

188
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:36,263
Many analysts foresee at the popping of 
the Canadian real estate bubble along 

189
00:10:39,661 --> 00:10:42,780
with all the consequences that that 
would have on its economy.

190
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,733
And look,
almost 7% of the country's employments 

191
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:45,984
belongs to the construction sector and 
thanks to this mortgage boom at three 

192
00:10:48,811 --> 00:10:52,380
Canadian banks are now in the top 20 
banks worldwide.

193
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,273
In fact,
the market value of the Royal Bank of 

194
00:10:54,241 --> 00:10:57,420
Canada is higher than that of any bank 
in the eurozone.

195
00:10:59,250 --> 00:10:59,910
Okay.

196
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,743
As everyone knows,
the consequences of the real estate 

197
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:05,580
bubble bursting would be pretty dire to 
doing something about.

198
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:08,610
This has to come another priority of the
Canadian government,

199
00:11:08,730 --> 00:11:09,563
the government's,
it's trying to stimulate other sectors 

200
00:11:10,981 --> 00:11:13,530
as well.
Cooling down the real estate market,

201
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:14,423
maybe the intention,
so you increase the arrival of 

202
00:11:15,481 --> 00:11:18,690
immigrants by 50% every year.
It has a lot to do with this.

203
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,420
More immigrants means more demand for 
real estate,

204
00:11:21,450 --> 00:11:23,580
but other experts,
they disagree with this and state.

205
00:11:23,581 --> 00:11:24,414
The Canadian banks were not affected by 
the 2008 crisis and that they are quite 

206
00:11:28,681 --> 00:11:32,430
a bit more solid than other 
international banks and also the economy

207
00:11:32,431 --> 00:11:33,264
in Canada.
It's doing quite well and is gaining 

208
00:11:34,711 --> 00:11:36,650
strength after some pretty mediocre.
Yeah.

209
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,533
Yes.

210
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:42,790
Anyway,
time will tell,

211
00:11:42,791 --> 00:11:45,540
but this is a risk that the government 
is going to have to look out for.

212
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:46,463
All right,
so now let's move on to the matter of 

213
00:11:47,801 --> 00:11:48,940
public services.

214
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:52,683
Okay.

215
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,063
The waiting lists.
Health is a public service which is 

216
00:11:58,931 --> 00:12:02,320
managed and financed by the governments 
with the citizens and its taxes.

217
00:12:02,321 --> 00:12:03,154
Of course,
this system is considered to be one of 

218
00:12:04,361 --> 00:12:05,740
the best in the world.
However,

219
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:10,330
they have recently had to deal with some
very serious problems and most important

220
00:12:10,331 --> 00:12:13,360
of all of these problems is the issue of
waiting lists.

221
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,313
According to the Fraser Institute,
the average time to see a specialist is 

222
00:12:16,810 --> 00:12:19,900
18 weeks.
That's more than four months,

223
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:20,793
and the demographic of the aging 
population and the increase of life 

224
00:12:22,901 --> 00:12:25,240
expectancy has made it difficult for the
system

225
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,253
cut

226
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,513
resulted in tens of thousands of 
Canadians and moving to the u s to 

227
00:12:31,361 --> 00:12:32,194
receive medical attention lately that 
has even popular to take our medical 

228
00:12:35,081 --> 00:12:37,000
insurance in the United States.

229
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,163
Anyway,
these are the main challenges and 

230
00:12:41,551 --> 00:12:43,500
threats to the government of Justin 
Trudeau.

231
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:45,600
Like we said earlier,
not everything,

232
00:12:45,601 --> 00:12:48,060
and be sunshine and lollipops and 
rainbows,

233
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,133
but you know what we think are the 
overall results of the Canadian 

234
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:52,440
cocktail.
Well,

235
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,200
we think it looks pretty good.
So now it's your turn.

236
00:12:55,230 --> 00:12:57,480
What do you think of Canada and their 
systems?
