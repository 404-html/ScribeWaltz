1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,140
Right,
lights,

2
00:00:08,140 --> 00:00:09,190
slot machines,
poker,

3
00:00:09,191 --> 00:00:10,600
blackjack,
all of all mine,

4
00:00:10,601 --> 00:00:12,550
so probably interests traveled to 
London,

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,473
Vegas,

6
00:00:17,250 --> 00:00:18,083
sin.
It's the place that everyone thinks of 

7
00:00:19,281 --> 00:00:20,114
when they think of gambling as well.
That's because it's the world's capital 

8
00:00:23,001 --> 00:00:24,110
of gambling,
right?

9
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:25,003
Well,
actually it is not because the world's 

10
00:00:27,231 --> 00:00:30,530
leading capital of gambling is by no 
means Las Vegas.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:31,423
It's Macau.
Macau is an autonomous city located in 

12
00:00:33,921 --> 00:00:36,860
the south of China,
very close to Hong Kong.

13
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,700
In fact,
it's so close to Hong Kong,

14
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:42,800
but the fastest way to get to Macau from
Hong Kong is by a fast ferry.

15
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:47,890
It takes about an hour.
Macau is a very curious city.

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:51,173
On the one hand,
it's a small slice of Portugal inside 

17
00:00:53,401 --> 00:00:56,670
the very chaotic Asian southwest.
On the other hand,

18
00:00:56,671 --> 00:01:00,990
it's place where skyscrapers and bowls,
modern architecture of very easy to do

19
00:01:01,030 --> 00:01:01,863
fine

20
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:04,373
landscape is dominated by an enormous 
skyscraper skyscraper with colorful 

21
00:01:08,361 --> 00:01:13,140
crystals in the sheep of Lotus flowers.
This building is the Grand Lisboa.

22
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:17,000
Above all,
the Macau is something of a messy city.

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,000
It's all rather ramshackle and full of 
tiny little street

24
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:25,343
was the last colonial European city in 
Asia and it remained a colonial city 

25
00:01:29,391 --> 00:01:33,830
until very recent times for centuries.
It was a part of Portugal that was until

26
00:01:33,831 --> 00:01:37,400
the end of 1999 when it was finally 
integrated with China.

27
00:01:37,490 --> 00:01:41,150
At this point it was set up in China as 
a special administrative region.

28
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,370
This essentially allows for the one 
country,

29
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:47,030
but two systems set up these two cities,
Macau and Hong Kong,

30
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:47,864
even though they are a part of China,
keep their own legislation with certain 

31
00:01:51,141 --> 00:01:51,974
limitations and they also have their own
customs caught currency and political 

32
00:01:55,491 --> 00:01:57,110
institutions.
In practical terms,

33
00:01:57,111 --> 00:01:59,810
they really work as if they are a 
different country from China.

34
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,080
Interestingly in Macau,
Portuguese is still an official language

35
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:08,090
which normally an issue.
Ilene with Zoe and we will give the MCO.

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,303
Well really mcconnell could be more 
considered a gambling theme part rather 

37
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,364
than a city.
Every year Macau receives over 30 

38
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,313
million tourists.
This makes this tiny piece of land is 

39
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:24,840
one of the most visited places in the 
world.

40
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:26,820
So why is this?
You might be asking.

41
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:27,683
Well,
that's because it's the only place in 

42
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,000
the whole of China where gambling is 
permitted.

43
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:37,843
Thanks this,

44
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,180
since there's integration with China or 
up until 2014,

45
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:42,043
the region has enjoyed one of the 
fastest periods of economic growth in 

46
00:02:45,290 --> 00:02:47,270
history.
In a little over 10 years,

47
00:02:47,330 --> 00:02:51,170
GDP has multiplied by 10 going from 
$5,000,000,000

48
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:54,290
to 55 billion.
Now.

49
00:02:54,291 --> 00:02:55,124
There was a very key moments in this 
growth phase and that was when mccowen 

50
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:58,994
gave the gambling free reign.
It was at this very moment so that huge 

51
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:03,634
multinational gambling companies moved 
in to establish themselves in Macau and 

52
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,343
this changed the identity forever.
There's something about the Asian 

53
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:11,974
culture where gaming is acceptable as a 
form of entertainment and so that is a 

54
00:03:15,370 --> 00:03:16,203
major driver of the success I think that
you've seen here and clearly in 

55
00:03:19,571 --> 00:03:20,404
Singapore today.
The city is known as Chinese last Vegas 

56
00:03:22,391 --> 00:03:23,224
for its high concentration of casinos at
dear view is about is something of a 

57
00:03:27,161 --> 00:03:30,700
ridiculous name because gambling in 
Macau is a way,

58
00:03:30,701 --> 00:03:33,550
way bigger deal than in Las Vegas.
In the cows.

59
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:37,600
Forty plus casinos in 2015.
Over $29,000,000,000

60
00:03:37,601 --> 00:03:40,840
was invoiced,
which for some perspective is five times

61
00:03:40,841 --> 00:03:41,420
that of last year,

62
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,253
Vegas

63
00:03:43,810 --> 00:03:44,643
in 2013,
it reached the astonishing amount of 

64
00:03:47,050 --> 00:03:47,883
$45,000,000,000,
which for a comparison is almost the 

65
00:03:50,411 --> 00:03:51,244
same as the entire amounts of money that
franz receives from its entire tourism 

66
00:03:55,511 --> 00:03:56,344
industry.
It really is pretty amazing gambling 

67
00:03:58,780 --> 00:04:00,190
lights.
Luxury shops,

68
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:02,980
sends well still more lights.
That is Macau's,

69
00:04:02,981 --> 00:04:03,820
new identity.

70
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:07,910
My cows casinos

71
00:04:09,390 --> 00:04:10,223
now on every time you think of gambling,
do not think of a Monte Carlo or Las 

72
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,393
Vegas,
but do think of Macau and there is 

73
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:19,340
absolutely no slowing down.
Three new mega casinos.

74
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,620
The result of multimillion dollar 
investments that have opened in the last

75
00:04:22,621 --> 00:04:27,621
12 months.
For example,

76
00:04:28,041 --> 00:04:31,790
at the end of 2015,
these studio city development opens.

77
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,990
This is a huge hotel casino complex with
a Hollywood atmosphere.

78
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,853
Interestingly,
it's opening saw the production of a 

79
00:04:38,571 --> 00:04:39,404
short 15 minute film which had a 
production budget of $70 million 

80
00:04:42,771 --> 00:04:44,510
dollars,
which is a record by the way.

81
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,373
The film was directed by Martin Scorsese
and had lead roles played by Robert De 

82
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:50,840
Niro,
Leonardo Dicaprio,

83
00:04:50,841 --> 00:04:51,674
and Brad Pitt,
which leaves us wondering what possible 

84
00:04:53,361 --> 00:04:54,730
hotel opening good editorial.

85
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,313
This part,

86
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,370
Lee,
in August 2016,

87
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:12,230
the wind palace opened its doors.
This is a luxurious hotel with 1,700

88
00:05:12,231 --> 00:05:13,064
Greens,
which cost about four point 2 billion 

89
00:05:14,721 --> 00:05:19,721
USD.
You just hotel to open.

90
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:24,150
At the time of writing was the 
Parisians.

91
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:27,480
This is a masterpiece created bind for 
last Vegas Sands Company,

92
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:29,960
which is owned by wealthy invest.
If Sheldon Adelson.

93
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:32,490
This

94
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,970
hotel is essentially a city in itself 
with free thousand rooms,

95
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,940
a waterpark and even its own half scare 
life for

96
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:40,063
tower.

97
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,320
Oh yes.
The openings do continue.

98
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,273
The next opening is going to be the 13,
which is billed as the most expensive 

99
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:51,773
hotel in the world.
Some of the rooms in this hotel are 

100
00:05:53,521 --> 00:05:54,354
going to cost between 50 and a hundred 
thousand dollars night and know that is 

101
00:05:58,701 --> 00:06:00,620
not a mistake.
On the plus side,

102
00:06:00,621 --> 00:06:01,454
guests are going to have the use of 30 
rolls royces burst at the cost of 50 to 

103
00:06:04,621 --> 00:06:05,720
$100,000
a night.

104
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:09,410
They should probably be be giving you a 
Rolls Royce along with these new hotels.

105
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:10,263
Casinos,
some of the most legendary in Macau 

106
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,080
currently are the Galaxy Grand Lisboa,
the city of dreams,

107
00:06:15,081 --> 00:06:16,550
the Venetian,
the mgm,

108
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:19,970
as well as many more.
If Mcconnell keeps this up,

109
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,200
the Strip in Las Vegas is soon going to 
look like the work of an amateur

110
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:29,530
profit sharing in the cow more than 
yeah,

111
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,020
80 percent of governmental income comes 
from these casinos ends.

112
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:37,410
The money is so abundant that every year
Macau has a significant budget.

113
00:06:37,411 --> 00:06:40,890
Surplus Mcconnell is completely 
unfamiliar with the idea of a deficit,

114
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,720
and as you can probably imagine from 
this,

115
00:06:42,721 --> 00:06:43,554
taxes are rather low.
So now you might be wondering what 

116
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:49,230
exactly does the government do with such
a huge surplus every year?

117
00:06:49,290 --> 00:06:50,123
Well,
a part of it is invested in 

118
00:06:51,091 --> 00:06:54,960
infrastructure,
but an entire third of it is wait for it

119
00:06:55,130 --> 00:06:58,320
paid to Macau Macau's citizens as a 
dividend.

120
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,251
Yes.
Again,

121
00:06:59,251 --> 00:07:02,070
we are not making a mistake here since 
2008,

122
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:02,963
all of the city's inhabitants have 
received a portion of the income from 

123
00:07:06,391 --> 00:07:07,890
the casinos.
For example,

124
00:07:07,891 --> 00:07:08,724
in 2016,
the dividend was a thousand dollars per 

125
00:07:11,401 --> 00:07:13,740
citizen.
This means that for a family of four,

126
00:07:13,741 --> 00:07:16,830
they are getting a check for $4,000
every single year,

127
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:17,723
which isn't exactly bad and this is not 
the only benefit that the citizens get 

128
00:07:21,541 --> 00:07:22,374
from the casinos.
Every one in four jobs in Macau is in 

129
00:07:24,391 --> 00:07:26,490
the casino industry,
so low taxes,

130
00:07:26,491 --> 00:07:29,760
high employment rates,
and dividends paid out from the casinos.

131
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:32,870
It all seems like a pretty sweet deal.
However,

132
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:35,220
not everything is sunshine and rainbows 
and yeah,

133
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:39,020
lollipops,
crises in Macau,

134
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,123
most tourists,

135
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:41,993
Macau,
around two thirds coming from 

136
00:07:42,901 --> 00:07:43,734
continental China.
This means that the economy over the 

137
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:49,290
region is highly dependent on China's,
and if that wasn't enough,

138
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:50,124
she shipping the president of China,
started a war against public work at 

139
00:07:53,221 --> 00:07:56,010
corruption in 2015.
After that time,

140
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:58,560
the economy of Macau collapsed.

141
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:02,330
Chinese President Xi Jinping has been 
cleaning house on the mainland,

142
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,193
including cracking down on those.
Trying to take money out of the country 

143
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,570
illegally and that's making some high 
rollers.

144
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,570
Very wary about spending big in Macau

145
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,513
in a single year.
The gambling income over the city fell 

146
00:08:14,711 --> 00:08:15,544
by 40 percent.
This led to the economy of Macau losing 

147
00:08:17,831 --> 00:08:21,580
more than 20 percent of its GDP.
The corrupts public workers in China had

148
00:08:21,581 --> 00:08:23,890
gotten use to the idea of going to 
Macau.

149
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:26,650
They could easily spend their money,
do some gambling,

150
00:08:26,651 --> 00:08:29,550
attended red carpet like events and 
while they're there,

151
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:30,850
probably do some laundry.

152
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:31,743
Have the money for it generally,
and I decided there will be no 

153
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:35,920
investigation.
Now if you'll excuse me,

154
00:08:35,921 --> 00:08:36,540
I'll go away

155
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:37,373
now.
It's not as if the whole industry 

156
00:08:38,491 --> 00:08:41,970
depends on them,
but as in the Chinese economic slow down

157
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,873
and to the new controls established by 
the Chinese government as many of these 

158
00:08:45,481 --> 00:08:48,750
vip so you used to go to Macau,
have simply stopped doing so.

159
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,240
Now this is going to continue for a 
little while at least,

160
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:52,074
and it's causing problems from the cow 
because half of their economy relies on 

161
00:08:56,010 --> 00:08:59,070
thanks to numerous investments,
a good state of public finance,

162
00:08:59,071 --> 00:09:01,950
and is the advantage of being such an 
important tourist cluster.

163
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,800
These social and economic effects have 
been limited,

164
00:09:04,801 --> 00:09:06,900
so the government's keeps a comfortable 
surplus.

165
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:07,783
The unemployment rate is one point eight
percent and his family incomes have not 

166
00:09:10,561 --> 00:09:13,290
suffered violence.
One thing is absolutely true.

167
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,810
As Xi Jinping said on his last visit to 
the city,

168
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:19,830
it is time for diversification and the 
governments has already presented a plan

169
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:20,240
to tackle

170
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:21,073
Columbus

171
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:26,920
based on family tourism,
health,

172
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,080
tourism,
finance,

173
00:09:28,081 --> 00:09:30,630
and the technological industry.
In the next few years,

174
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:33,540
the economy has already started to 
bounce back.

175
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:35,850
If the government's plans do become a 
reality,

176
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:40,170
Macau might become some sort of 21st 
century Monaco in the next few years.

177
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:45,000
The city's mistake was to put all of its
eggs in one basket and not diversifying.

178
00:09:45,030 --> 00:09:48,300
They didn't make it easy for companies 
to form and they didn't make it easy for

179
00:09:48,301 --> 00:09:49,134
outside investors to come in.
This is something that also happened in 

180
00:09:51,511 --> 00:09:52,344
Atlantic city with serious consequences,
but that's something we're going to be 

181
00:09:54,841 --> 00:09:57,960
looking at in a future video.
So what do you think about Macau?

But the cookbook or watching the 
floorman shift forces are watching.

187
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,470
The casino manager was watching the 
shift bosses.

188
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:22,560
I'm watching the casino manager and the 
eye in the sky.

189
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:23,783
Watching yourself.
