1
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:08,610
Yeah,
the travel to Spain.

2
00:00:08,750 --> 00:00:10,780
Have you ever visited Barcelona in the 
or?

3
00:00:10,970 --> 00:00:12,450
Maybe the Canary Islands?
Well,

4
00:00:12,460 --> 00:00:15,040
if you have ensure there is something 
isn't much.

5
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:18,080
Have surprised you decide the facts.
That scene isn't a crisis.

6
00:00:18,081 --> 00:00:18,914
And as the second highest unemployment 
rates in all of Europe and a wealthy 

7
00:00:21,411 --> 00:00:22,360
country facilities,
uh,

8
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,213
clean the roads of brand new pavements,
there are international airports and 

9
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:26,954
every other city and this state of the 
art high speed train network throughout 

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:31,010
most of the time.

11
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:31,843
Sure.

12
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:35,763
At least on the surface.
Madrid has no reasons to be jealous of 

13
00:00:38,790 --> 00:00:40,600
Zurich London.
Then again,

14
00:00:40,601 --> 00:00:44,440
we also came out as a country that was 
at the edge of bankruptcy,

15
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:45,423
not such a long time and go and now has 
gone through one of the biggest 

16
00:00:48,641 --> 00:00:51,040
political crisis in their recent 
history.

17
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:57,360
Premier will have to leave the 
government.

18
00:00:57,780 --> 00:00:59,610
Congress has passed and impeachment bill

19
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,613
impeachment means that the congress,
that is the legislative power loops to 

20
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:04,484
kick the executive out.
Unlike other countries like America in 

21
00:01:07,311 --> 00:01:08,144
Spain,
you need to propose an alternative 

22
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:11,840
governments that will substitute for the
format.

23
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:15,800
This makes impeachments attempts almost 
impossible to pull off in this country,

24
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:16,683
but these all strange days and Spanish 
political life's the brand new Spanish 

25
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:20,534
presidents and the Social Democrats,
Padre Sanchez has managed to convince 

26
00:01:23,961 --> 00:01:24,794
the radical left the nationalist right,
and so the independent Catalunian 

27
00:01:28,160 --> 00:01:28,993
parties to vote against the conservative
government of Marianna at a height they 

28
00:01:32,571 --> 00:01:35,210
will have one thing in common.
They didn't want more of this,

29
00:01:39,450 --> 00:01:42,830
and now you might be wondering,
why did Roy have so many haters?

30
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:45,030
Well,
while you might think it's corruption,

31
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:47,040
and of course this is the official 
reason,

32
00:01:47,041 --> 00:01:50,040
but beyond the surface,
that's way more of that.

33
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:50,993
As we said before,
Spain is one of the most damaged 

34
00:01:52,441 --> 00:01:55,020
countries from the big financial crisis 
of 2008,

35
00:01:55,170 --> 00:01:56,003
and the forming government likes to brag
about that economic achievements with 

36
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:00,450
statements like this one

37
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,760
been an honor to leave this country in 
better shape than I found it.

38
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,260
Marianna over to Hawaii.

39
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,110
This is why in today's video we have a 
lot of questions to cover.

40
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:15,690
First has gotten over the crisis 
already.

41
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,270
Science and economic growth and 
unemployment reduction.

42
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,104
This country still has more than 16 
percent unemployment rates and other 

43
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:26,340
countries like Ireland driving faster 
than stain,

44
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:31,050
so can we really save that they've left 
the financial crisis behinds and if so,

45
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,590
what credit because we give to the 
conservative

46
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:34,463
governments also.
Is it a good moment to invest in Spain 

47
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,913
today?
We're going to answer with these 

48
00:02:38,491 --> 00:02:40,110
questions,
but before we do,

49
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,320
let's take a look back at the history

50
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:45,580
black.

51
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,460
In the year 2002,
the eurozone was created.

52
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,050
All of the sudden Spain,
Germany,

53
00:02:50,051 --> 00:02:50,884
France,
and many other countries started to use 

54
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:54,310
the same currency,
the euro,

55
00:02:54,430 --> 00:02:55,263
and the same interest rates.
The ones that the European central bank 

56
00:02:57,701 --> 00:03:00,400
fixes.
This seems to be a great idea.

57
00:03:00,401 --> 00:03:01,234
Having the same currency,
a German bank and lends money to a 

58
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:06,130
Spanish company on the same conditions 
as they wish a German company,

59
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:09,760
but these advantages come with a risk.
If Spain goes bankrupt,

60
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,540
this German bank with Spanish debt might
get bankrupts too.

61
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,640
In other words,
if a country does poorly,

62
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:18,400
they might spread to the problems to 
other countries.

63
00:03:22,850 --> 00:03:24,290
Swipe.
When you join the euro,

64
00:03:24,291 --> 00:03:25,124
you must follow some rules.
One of them is that no country can have 

65
00:03:27,681 --> 00:03:29,480
a deficit.
They got them three percent.

66
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,380
This means they cannot spend more than 
what they collect in taxes.

67
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:34,273
They said,
let's fast forward to listening in 

68
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:36,314
history to the year 2008,
the year of the international financial 

69
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,650
crisis.
Many European countries suffer this pain

70
00:03:42,651 --> 00:03:43,484
among them.
Suddenly the unemployment rate goes sky 

71
00:03:45,321 --> 00:03:46,154
high until it's the pasta 20 percent.
This means that all of a sudden the 

72
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:50,920
government collects little money in 
taxes during that,

73
00:03:50,921 --> 00:03:52,970
those international apolis and high 
speed trains.

74
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,010
I told you about,
well,

75
00:03:54,210 --> 00:03:58,190
assassinating not cheap,
and this is why the inevitable happened.

76
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,500
Spain,
Greece,

77
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,430
and Ireland had the highest budget 
deficits in the EU in 2012.

78
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:07,103
Maximum deficits at urec country could 
have was three percent saying 10 

79
00:04:10,741 --> 00:04:11,574
percent.
This meant nobody wanted to lend money 

80
00:04:13,201 --> 00:04:14,880
to their governments.
At the end of the day,

81
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:15,953
are you going to pay it back when you 
spend 10 percent more than what you 

82
00:04:18,061 --> 00:04:20,790
collect?
If you've followed visual politics for a

83
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,624
long time,
you already know what happens when 

84
00:04:22,561 --> 00:04:25,260
investors don't trust your credit 
reliability,

85
00:04:25,261 --> 00:04:26,280
rice,
and see

86
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:27,640
what did they do well?
Yep,

87
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,370
exactly.
They asked for higher interest rates.

88
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:32,110
Now listen,
up in the euro zone,

89
00:04:32,140 --> 00:04:36,190
we have an index to measure the chances 
of a country to forcing.

90
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,900
It's the so called risk.

91
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:40,123
Yeah.

92
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:46,430
Basically what they do is take the most 
trustworthy debts,

93
00:04:46,431 --> 00:04:49,570
phones that exists in Europe.
This is the German bonds.

94
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:53,750
Then they can pay the interest rate of 
the German bonds with the interest rates

95
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,733
of the other ones.
The number that against with this 

96
00:04:55,911 --> 00:05:00,200
comparison is called the risk premium,
so in the year 2010,

97
00:05:00,201 --> 00:05:03,590
the Spanish debt at a risk premium of 50
points,

98
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:07,610
and this was okay,
but one year later it had 250,

99
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:08,700
which is five times more

100
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:14,660
Spanish bonds at brisk as contained 
gathers force,

101
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:17,590
and this is where the men in black came 
into the eviction.

102
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,483
Yes.
The men in black wasn't an given by the 

103
00:05:19,991 --> 00:05:22,690
journalist to the European Central Bank 
workers.

104
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:25,900
These ECV people.
When's the most problematic countries in

105
00:05:25,901 --> 00:05:28,990
the euro zone and requested that they 
follow the rules.

106
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:29,883
Basically what they said was,
it says right here that you concept the 

107
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,590
deficit bigger than three percent,
but your giving crazy stop wasting money

108
00:05:35,710 --> 00:05:36,543
or will punish you.

109
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:40,793
In countries like Ireland,
these men in black where especially 

110
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:43,673
strict and some even forced the 
parliaments of choose another prime 

111
00:05:47,011 --> 00:05:49,470
minister who was more fiscally 
responsible,

112
00:05:49,590 --> 00:05:52,430
but one of them is insane.
What did these men in black do

113
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,660
in the country of Sangria and Pieta?
November the 20th,

114
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:12,203
2011.
This is the day when these Spanish 

115
00:06:14,641 --> 00:06:17,610
people's party kicks us in the 
elections.

116
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,473
The Conservative leader,
Mariana or Ohio becomes one of the most 

117
00:06:20,670 --> 00:06:23,540
supportive leaders in Europe and he 
supposed to buy it.

118
00:06:23,541 --> 00:06:26,320
Viktor Orban in Hungary,
the Spanish people's Party.

119
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,154
Your as it's fascinating,
pep got 53 percent of the seats in 

120
00:06:30,451 --> 00:06:31,284
Congress ends.
They ruled in most of the regional 

121
00:06:33,031 --> 00:06:33,864
government.

122
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:36,813
Basically Mr Roy was so popular that he 
could have probably gotten away with 

123
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,800
changing the name of Spain to recoil 
lands.

124
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,680
So what was this political program 
during the elections?

125
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:45,573
Well,
basically Roy sent to the European 

126
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:47,850
Central Bank

127
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,860
guys,
don't worry unconservative,

128
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:50,694
so I know my economics first going to 
reduce taxes and then I'm going to make 

129
00:06:54,061 --> 00:06:54,894
loads of business friendly reforms that 
would make this country like silicon 

130
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,560
valley than those companies helped 
people make billions hoppy

131
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,190
and same deficit problem solves.
All right guys.

132
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,670
Basically the whole campaign was based 
on the idea of like taxes.

133
00:07:14,671 --> 00:07:18,150
The mantra for any problem was to reduce
taxes and everything

134
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:23,260
by most important.

135
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,543
Did you know the.
What they say during the electoral 

136
00:07:33,711 --> 00:07:34,544
campaign is one thing and what they do 
one day after taking office is another 

137
00:07:39,171 --> 00:07:40,004
thing entirely.

138
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:45,760
Government must raise some taxes for 
some time in Florida.

139
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,293
During the months of Roy,
the government raised the taxes 

140
00:07:52,361 --> 00:07:53,194
including VAT,
income tax and all the special taxes on 

141
00:07:54,881 --> 00:07:56,270
tobacco in gasoline.
Yup.

142
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:01,090
A Conservative government made the 
biggest tax increase in Spanish history.

143
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:01,983
I want about all of these wonderful 
business regulations that would turn 

144
00:08:04,031 --> 00:08:06,850
Spain into the new silicon valley.
Well,

145
00:08:06,910 --> 00:08:09,340
you can imagine what happens with that 
one.

146
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,603
So what happens when you promise a 
business friendly agenda and it's come 

147
00:08:12,851 --> 00:08:14,560
up with the opposite ones here in 
office?

148
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,710
Well,
devices,

149
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,593
they get angry,
but there's nothing they can really do 

150
00:08:17,441 --> 00:08:20,890
until the next election.
But the international investors,

151
00:08:20,891 --> 00:08:25,000
they can give you their backs the very 
moment you break that trust,

152
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:27,640
and this is exactly what happened in 
Spain.

153
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:33,250
Spanish academy in huge crisis after 
credit downgrade.

154
00:08:33,470 --> 00:08:37,310
Basically the Spanish debt bombs fell 
into the category of trash.

155
00:08:37,430 --> 00:08:40,010
You remember about that risk premium 
that I told you about earlier.

156
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:43,760
So at some points it went to the Satanic
Sega of six,

157
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:44,570
six,
six,

158
00:08:44,570 --> 00:08:45,403
many Spanish banks were to the edge of 
bankruptcy and no one wanted to buy any 

159
00:08:49,551 --> 00:08:51,170
Spanish debt.
Spain,

160
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,820
it was about to collapse and that would 
mean no money to pay doctors,

161
00:08:54,830 --> 00:08:57,360
school teachers,
and tax collectors.

162
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,630
Only one team though anyone could solve 
this problem.

163
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,163
Black

164
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,920
to accept rescue from Europe for an 
ailing banks.

165
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:11,430
So what was this all about?
Basically,

166
00:09:11,431 --> 00:09:13,550
Europe would lend money at a lower 
interest rate,

167
00:09:13,551 --> 00:09:16,380
so Spanish banks could not go bankrupt.
In exchange,

168
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:19,080
they requested the government to cut 
spending.

169
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:24,150
And here is where did his big bad ass 
movement,

170
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,350
or as we like to call it,
roughly and nomics basically,

171
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,820
once the European Central Bank had 
already nailed down,

172
00:09:29,821 --> 00:09:33,000
the banks were highly to those men in 
black and set essentially.

173
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,460
What's up dudes,
you think you could tell me what to do.

174
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,810
Look at these bad boys.

175
00:09:42,090 --> 00:09:42,923
Siri was the stainless too big to fail.
So despite having the worst credit 

176
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:46,404
rating,
you can imagine the European Central 

177
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,683
Bank would eventually buy all the debt 
bonds without asking to any interest 

178
00:09:51,121 --> 00:09:51,954
rates.
How well printing money with this money 

179
00:09:54,631 --> 00:09:55,464
Stan could keep being as it was,
without making any costly reforms that 

180
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:00,390
well.
Now the question is,

181
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:01,224
why would the ECB acceptable of this?
That's actually easy because stain has 

182
00:10:04,291 --> 00:10:07,770
the fourth biggest economy in Europe and
nobody's going to let it fail.

183
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,320
Sorry.
The months while they kept passing,

184
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:14,490
unemployment's kept growing and so did 
that risk premium.

185
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:15,593
The conservative governments of the 
People's party far from making business 

186
00:10:18,181 --> 00:10:23,181
friendly reforms.
They did about an example prior to them.

187
00:10:26,221 --> 00:10:27,054
The professional services like taxi 
drivers were going to the liberalized 

188
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:33,960
insane taxi driver.
Associations are well connected with the

189
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:34,794
conservative,
so the right wing pasta bill to protect 

190
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,153
taxi drivers from competition.
This is why many sharing economy 

191
00:10:41,161 --> 00:10:44,160
companies like either an Addie and dee 
now have many,

192
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:47,140
many restrictions in the Spanish market.
The question is

193
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:51,550
the real challenge the European Central 
Bank works and the answer is,

194
00:10:51,970 --> 00:10:52,803
Oh yeah,
these say B is ready to do whatever it 

195
00:10:56,921 --> 00:11:01,921
takes to preserve the euro and believe 
me,

196
00:11:02,350 --> 00:11:07,350
it wouldn't be enough for Mario comes to
the rescue

197
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,090
four months,
the ECB president's,

198
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,750
Mario Draghi said he would not 
compromise with stain.

199
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:16,703
Basically rewired wanted him to print 
more money so he could buy a Spanish 

200
00:11:19,940 --> 00:11:20,773
desks and otherwise Roy wanted the 
wealthier countries like Germany and 

201
00:11:24,181 --> 00:11:28,610
sendlane's do give money to stain at no 
political cost just because,

202
00:11:28,630 --> 00:11:31,350
well apparently reasons it doesn't sound
very fair,

203
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:32,311
does it?
Well,

204
00:11:32,311 --> 00:11:35,610
sometimes three rounds he has.
Life's not fair and Roy,

205
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,260
he was right.
Spain,

206
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:38,403
Mr.

207
00:11:39,930 --> 00:11:40,763
thanks

208
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:45,170
b could be ready to buy week Italian 
Spanish bonds.

209
00:11:45,510 --> 00:11:49,200
Since then,
25 percent of the Spanish debt is in ECB

210
00:11:49,201 --> 00:11:50,034
hands and those words from Mario Draghi 
saying he would do whatever it takes to 

211
00:11:53,291 --> 00:11:54,124
save the euro like magic.
One day at a time the risk premium of 

212
00:11:57,911 --> 00:11:58,744
Spain started falling.
Investors don't in buying debt phones 

213
00:12:01,301 --> 00:12:03,520
because they knew they had the backing 
of the ECB,

214
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:08,270
and this is stain could keep piling on 
more and more debt.

215
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:09,333
This country now has a depth that 
represents more than a hundred percent 

216
00:12:12,340 --> 00:12:14,650
of that entire GDP.
Meanwhile,

217
00:12:14,651 --> 00:12:17,050
the rest of the European countries have 
started growing.

218
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:22,513
Two Thousand and 12 Gemini has become 
the biggest export powerhouse in the 

219
00:12:25,521 --> 00:12:26,354
entire wells.
China has gone from being the world 

220
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:29,283
sanctuary to developing brands,
new consumer market where everybody can 

221
00:12:32,301 --> 00:12:34,070
sell their products.
In other words,

222
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:37,700
every European country is growing now 
and that of course does include Spain.

223
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,370
Nonetheless,
this was good news is every government's

224
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,900
like good news.

225
00:12:45,270 --> 00:12:48,420
Spain has got over the crisis in record 
time.

226
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:51,010
This is already 2015 in this.
Yes.

227
00:12:51,011 --> 00:12:51,844
Staying at elections again and the 
government decides to celebrate at the 

228
00:12:55,510 --> 00:12:58,600
end of the crisis with a tax cut in the 
middle of the electoral campaign.

229
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,070
Pretty Brilliant News,
right?

230
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:01,053
You raise taxes at the beginning of one 
election and then one year before the 

231
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:06,130
next election you put them where they 
used to be.

232
00:13:06,190 --> 00:13:08,710
I think that's what happened right after
he won the elections again.

233
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:09,870
Yeah.
Guess

234
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:10,833
right?

235
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,233
Is his taxes again in 2017,
the government will have to cut $15 

236
00:13:18,771 --> 00:13:19,910
million in its deficit.

237
00:13:20,040 --> 00:13:20,873
Is it going?
Imagine raising and reducing taxes 

238
00:13:22,201 --> 00:13:25,200
depending on when you have elections is 
not the best policy.

239
00:13:25,201 --> 00:13:28,230
If you want to attract foreign investors
and red tape,

240
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,960
that's almost the same if not more 
prevalent than before,

241
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:33,000
and if you consider all the territorial 
problems,

242
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:37,170
you'll understand why the unemployment 
rate in stain is still a 16 percent.

243
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,410
Other countries

244
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:45,130
he's in the eurozone like Estonia and 
islands,

245
00:13:45,131 --> 00:13:48,820
which had really bad recessions are now 
way better than 10 years ago.

246
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,390
While Spain remains though.

247
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:54,693
Now it's your son.
Do you think that the brand new Spanish 

248
00:13:55,811 --> 00:13:58,360
government can do any worse than the 
previous one?

249
00:13:58,420 --> 00:13:59,253
Do you think Spain has sold its crisis?
Do you think there's lots of work still 

250
00:14:02,201 --> 00:14:03,130
to do that?
