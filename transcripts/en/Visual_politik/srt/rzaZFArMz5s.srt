1
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:09,093
In September of 2017,
Puerto Rico suffered it's most 

2
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:14,920
significant natural disaster in the last
100 years.

3
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:19,443
The impacts of Hurricane Maria,
a huge category for cycling a category 

4
00:00:22,301 --> 00:00:23,134
five at its strongest with wind gusts of
over 155 miles per hour and torrential 

5
00:00:26,711 --> 00:00:29,710
rain wreaks havoc on this islands.
The destruction,

6
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:30,783
it was enormous.
Thousands of houses were destroyed in 

7
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,550
the entire Puerto Rican electricity 
network collapsed.

8
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:38,740
The islands was quite literally engulfed
in darkness.

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,380
As you can imagine,
the economic damage was enormous.

10
00:00:41,381 --> 00:00:42,214
To give you an idea today,
the reconstruction costs have risen to 

11
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:49,501
around $100,000,000,000 and that's not 
at all.

12
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:53,293
Seven months later,
thousands of businesses remain closed 

13
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:57,440
and blackouts,
I'll still quite frequent.

14
00:00:57,470 --> 00:00:58,303
However,
if you are just wasting because 

15
00:00:59,271 --> 00:01:00,500
Hurricane Maria,
myself,

16
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:01,393
the whole story,

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:12,860
he says that the island's problems began
a really long time ago.

18
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:15,200
Pressing Rico,
they've been suffering a severe economic

19
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:16,034
crisis and the population exodus for 
more than 10 years and exit is so great 

20
00:01:19,701 --> 00:01:22,010
that it threatens the island's very 
survival.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,390
See officer declaring bankruptcy in May 
of 2017.

22
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:27,253
The situation has become so critical 
that the islands government is 

23
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:30,644
considering moving thousands of 
prisoners do private prisons in the 

24
00:01:34,340 --> 00:01:35,270
United States,
so why is this?

25
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:36,133
Well,
the islands government is even having 

26
00:01:37,131 --> 00:01:41,570
problems with financing it's own 
penitentiary system and renting spots in

27
00:01:41,571 --> 00:01:44,810
places like Texas or Florida is actually
proving to be.

28
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:45,923
Yeah.

29
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,680
Now,
hold on just a moment here.

30
00:01:49,681 --> 00:01:52,410
I mean prisoners to the United States.
It sounds kind of weird,

31
00:01:52,411 --> 00:01:53,244
but you absolutely heard it right.
Do not forget the Puerto Rico is a part 

32
00:01:56,371 --> 00:01:58,320
of the United States.
It's not a state,

33
00:01:58,321 --> 00:02:00,720
but it's kind of a free associated 
state.

34
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:09,330
When we left,
when we also love Puerto Rico,

35
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,780
it has to back and

36
00:02:20,110 --> 00:02:22,210
of course by being a part of the United 
States,

37
00:02:22,211 --> 00:02:24,190
having a tropical climate,
a rich history,

38
00:02:24,191 --> 00:02:26,800
and it's beautiful white sand beaches on
which by the way,

39
00:02:26,801 --> 00:02:29,620
Captain Jack Sparrow had some of his 
most famous exploits.

40
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,483
We might think that Puerto Rico has 
everything required to be one of the 

41
00:02:32,471 --> 00:02:35,230
most prosperous places in the world.
Well,

42
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:39,670
the reality is not so much.
The truth is rarely rather difference.

43
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:47,973
Here's a question for you.
Where do you think most Puerto Rican 

44
00:02:50,351 --> 00:02:51,184
slip?
I mean it sounds like a bit of a silly 

45
00:02:52,751 --> 00:02:55,300
question,
but it isn't because the answer,

46
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,360
it's not Puerto Rico.
The escape.

47
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,913
Yes,
but first Puerto Rico may look like a 

48
00:03:09,101 --> 00:03:10,210
paradise.
Good weather,

49
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,250
beautiful beaches,
wonderful music.

50
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:15,100
However,
the island has a huge problem.

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:15,963
Every year.
Thousands and thousands of Puerto Rican 

52
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:18,933
leave the islands.
See Puerto Rican been US citizens since 

53
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:22,264
1917.
They are Americans and they can move 

54
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:27,100
freely around that country.
Well,

55
00:03:27,101 --> 00:03:29,140
according to data from the Pew Research 
Center,

56
00:03:29,141 --> 00:03:29,974
during the last decades,
more than 500,000 Puerto Ricans have 

57
00:03:32,260 --> 00:03:34,480
left Puerto Rico to move to the 
consonants,

58
00:03:34,481 --> 00:03:37,540
to places like Texas,
Florida and New York and Pennsylvania.

59
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:40,513
Half a million people isn't absolutely 
huge number for an island that has just 

60
00:03:44,031 --> 00:03:46,640
over 3 million inhabitants seen in 
another way.

61
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:47,503
Not only in the last 10 years,
one of every seven inhabitants has left 

62
00:03:51,261 --> 00:03:54,290
Puerto Rico.
Rather.

63
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:55,303
The question I just asked,
why do you think most pressure eakins 

64
00:03:56,781 --> 00:03:59,360
lived?
While the answer is that since 2006,

65
00:03:59,361 --> 00:04:02,900
there are more Puerto Ricans living in 
the continental United States than there

66
00:04:02,901 --> 00:04:07,670
are on the island specifically more than
5 million compared to just over three.

67
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:08,983
We were watching a real live demographic
and population collapse on a monumental 

68
00:04:12,981 --> 00:04:13,814
scale.
Limestone and independent migration 

69
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:20,000
researcher and economist at the US 
Agriculture Department and things,

70
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:21,260
well,
they could get much,

71
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,710
much worse,
but the islands are in government expect

72
00:04:23,750 --> 00:04:28,430
just in 2018 for another 200,000 people 
to leave the islands.

73
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,500
This means that Puerto Rico will lose 
about six percent of its population in a

74
00:04:33,500 --> 00:04:34,333
single year.

75
00:04:38,500 --> 00:04:39,333
Sorry

76
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:43,580
if you thought this process,
this accident was already severe.

77
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:45,350
Well,
the consequences of Hurricane Maria,

78
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:47,360
they found the accelerated as different 
estimates,

79
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,194
both from the governments and from 
private consultants expect another half 

80
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:51,853
million Puerto Rican to pack their bags 
and move to the consonants in the next 

81
00:04:54,171 --> 00:04:55,004
five years.
I'm very attached to my island and my 

82
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:58,724
preference is to stay here,
but I have to think about what's best 

83
00:05:01,221 --> 00:05:03,200
for my son,
Victor Domingo's,

84
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:06,380
a 39 year old mortgage banker to the 
Washington Post.

85
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:08,000
As you may imagine,
Centra flights.

86
00:05:08,001 --> 00:05:10,610
We'll have very serious consequences for
the island,

87
00:05:10,611 --> 00:05:13,500
especially because most of those who are
leaving a young infants,

88
00:05:13,550 --> 00:05:15,290
it is estimated that half of all 
immigrants,

89
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:18,620
of all people who leave the islands are 
under 24 years of age,

90
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:21,720
so what's the result of all of this?
Well,

91
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:22,573
in the next decade,
Puerto Rico is population will decrease 

92
00:05:24,381 --> 00:05:27,290
to two point 5 million people.
That is to say in the next decade,

93
00:05:27,291 --> 00:05:30,530
Puerto Rico will lose 800,000 
inhabitants,

94
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:35,590
25 percent of its population,
and if another natural disaster,

95
00:05:39,711 --> 00:05:40,970
another hurricane,
for example,

96
00:05:40,971 --> 00:05:41,804
the cars or if the island fails to 
recover from the severe crisis that's 

97
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:46,520
going through the reality,
it could be even worse.

98
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,413
I mean,
can you imagine what this will mean for 

99
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:50,360
the island's economy?
Who's going to pay?

100
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,300
It's huge debt.
Who's going to pay for its pension?

101
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,013
Well,
I think at this point in the video we 

102
00:06:02,801 --> 00:06:06,340
need to ask a question,
why does so many Puerto Ricans leave the

103
00:06:06,341 --> 00:06:07,174
islands?
These statistics seem to be similar to 

104
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:10,720
that of a country going through a war.
So what's going on?

105
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,780
Well,
listen to this very long crisis.

106
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:27,420
If we take a look at the data,
the explanation seems very clear.

107
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:28,313
Almost half of Puerto Rican is living on
the islands are considered poor by US 

108
00:06:31,681 --> 00:06:34,830
standards.
The average family income is $20,000,

109
00:06:34,831 --> 00:06:37,740
which is slightly less than half of the 
average income of Mississippi.

110
00:06:37,741 --> 00:06:40,470
The poorest state in the continental 
United States.

111
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:42,120
Yes.

112
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,143
Well that's not all the islands.
Government is bankrupt and it is a huge 

113
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:54,160
public desk.
Seventy dollars,

114
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,500
billion dollars and another 
$50,000,000,000 in payment commitments.

115
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,353
Like for example,
it's pensions or we're talking about an 

116
00:06:59,771 --> 00:07:02,650
islands of just over 3 million 
inhabitants.

117
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:04,960
So that's really an insane amounts of 
money.

118
00:07:09,990 --> 00:07:13,620
It means that an average family would 
have to devote six years of their salary

119
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:14,543
to pay off the public debt.
So now you might be able to understand 

120
00:07:16,681 --> 00:07:19,860
why Puerto Rico is known as the grease 
of the Caribbean,

121
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,720
and if you think this is the worst of 
it,

122
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:22,613
when you're absolutely right,
is that there's hardly any work in 

123
00:07:26,591 --> 00:07:27,670
Puerto Rico.
In fact,

124
00:07:27,671 --> 00:07:30,670
the island has the lowest activity rates
in the United States.

125
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:33,940
Only four out of every 10 adults 
actively looking for work.

126
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:36,700
And if we don't come with the people who
don't have a job in the public sector,

127
00:07:36,730 --> 00:07:38,340
who salaries come out.
So if the taxes,

128
00:07:38,380 --> 00:07:40,780
the people who work in the private 
sector provide the results,

129
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:41,673
it's pretty alarming.
Less than a quarter of the island's 

130
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,400
inhabitants work in the private sector.

131
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:48,173
Bye.

132
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,053
Wait,
one of Puerto Rico's great problems is 

133
00:07:50,491 --> 00:07:51,324
precisely this.
Public employees and officials see 

134
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:57,630
almost one out of every four jobs on the
island corresponds to the governments.

135
00:07:57,631 --> 00:07:58,464
And that's not the worst part.
Did you know that many of these public 

136
00:08:01,171 --> 00:08:03,990
employees have the right to retire at 
the age of 50,

137
00:08:03,991 --> 00:08:07,260
which is 15 years earlier than in the 
rest of the United States.

138
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,690
And if you want things to get even more 
terrifying,

139
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,553
you can also keep in mind is that given 
the high percentage of young people 

140
00:08:18,931 --> 00:08:21,630
leaving,
the island's population is aging very,

141
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,980
very quickly.
In other words,

142
00:08:22,981 --> 00:08:25,830
if things don't change,
Puerto Rico will enter a very,

143
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:28,050
very difficult situation.
But okay.

144
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,580
I'm sure at this point in the video 
you're wondering,

145
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:30,414
well,
how on earth can the island get out of 

146
00:08:31,561 --> 00:08:32,394
this mess?
Is that really a way out for Puerto 

147
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,250
Rico?
Well,

148
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:36,083
that's how it look

149
00:08:41,230 --> 00:08:45,460
how to get out of this.
It's often

150
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,820
said that those who don't learn from 
history are condemned to repeat it,

151
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:49,713
and indeed this might happen in Puerto 
Rico when we talk about how local 

152
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:54,910
politicians see the future,
we find some good things,

153
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:58,530
but also some not so good things.
Puerto Rico has gone bankrupt.

154
00:08:58,531 --> 00:09:00,570
That's the facts.
And if they continue like this,

155
00:09:00,571 --> 00:09:03,000
the government could push the islands 
into the abyss.

156
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:05,520
So for one public spending has to be 
cost.

157
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:06,354
They have to stop the drainage.
That has caused such a huge amount of 

158
00:09:08,941 --> 00:09:09,350
public

159
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:10,183
debt.

160
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:13,050
Principal,
the new government,

161
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:15,450
Ricardo Rosales is working on this.
In fact,

162
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:18,660
he's committed to decreasing the 
government's size by a lot.

163
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,710
The volume is how he wants to do it,
isn't exactly clear indeed is not really

164
00:09:22,711 --> 00:09:25,500
clear if there's a real political will 
to correct the islands.

165
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:30,501
Massive problem.
The Puerto Rico has to turn its economic

166
00:09:31,191 --> 00:09:32,024
policy around and set some serious plans
in motion in order to attract 

167
00:09:34,851 --> 00:09:35,684
investments.
This is because Puerto Rico needs 

168
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:38,114
decisive measures.
It needs real reforms and not just 

169
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:41,343
cosmetically changes.
A few things have been done in recent 

170
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:43,911
years.
For example,

171
00:09:43,911 --> 00:09:46,840
they are trying to defend Puerto Rico 
into what kinds of financial center,

172
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:51,850
the guarantees anonymity to 
international investors work,

173
00:09:56,821 --> 00:09:58,710
but there's still a really long way to 
go.

174
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:00,330
Now,
before we end today's video,

175
00:10:00,331 --> 00:10:03,180
we still have to ask a very important 
question.

176
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,120
How on Earth did Puerto Rico get to this
point?

177
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:07,883
Well,
one reason was that local government 

178
00:10:08,861 --> 00:10:09,694
spent huge amounts of money to hire us.
We saw many public workers and to fund 

179
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,080
expensive projects that didn't give the 
island anything other than more

180
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,093
debt.

181
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:21,890
Reason has a lot to do with influence 
from the United States,

182
00:10:21,891 --> 00:10:24,770
but that's something we're going to tell
you about in an upcoming video.

183
00:10:24,771 --> 00:10:25,604
For now,
it's your turn because I want to ask a 

184
00:10:26,901 --> 00:10:27,734
question of you.
Do you think the pressure Rico should 

185
00:10:29,631 --> 00:10:30,464
continue to belong to the United States?
So do you think they should seek to 

186
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:34,790
become an independent country?
Well,

187
00:10:34,791 --> 00:10:37,530
you can leave your answer in the 
comments below as well as in this day,

188
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:39,050
