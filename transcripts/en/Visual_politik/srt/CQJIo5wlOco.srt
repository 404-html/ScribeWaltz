1
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,120
This is a great place to work.
This is what Donald Trump said,

2
00:00:12,121 --> 00:00:12,954
well,
referring to the White House in early 

3
00:00:14,131 --> 00:00:17,580
March of 2018 hours before his chief 
economic advisor,

4
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,020
Gary Cohn's resignation became public.
This is Gary Cohen's last meeting.

5
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:24,920
He's going to go out and make another 
couple of hundred dollars,

6
00:00:24,921 --> 00:00:25,754
million and

7
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,413
back

8
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:34,930
all the time.
This phrase,

9
00:00:34,931 --> 00:00:37,570
would it have been specially,
wouldn't have called anybody's attention

10
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:38,463
after all the White House,
and I don't think this will surprise 

11
00:00:40,811 --> 00:00:43,180
anyone.
It's one of the most sought after places

12
00:00:43,181 --> 00:00:44,014
to work in the world.
Having a job in the president's team 

13
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,730
means power,
influence and recognition.

14
00:00:48,790 --> 00:00:49,623
However way,
just the moments because we are 

15
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:51,874
forgetting a very important detail and 
that detail would be who the president 

16
00:00:55,601 --> 00:00:56,434
is and how he is.
Now you know this well in the trump 

17
00:00:58,661 --> 00:01:01,150
dictionary,
the term usually has no place.

18
00:01:01,151 --> 00:01:03,580
It simply does not exist.
Don't believe me.

19
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:08,640
Well,
listen up in the west wing

20
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:19,150
in January of 2017,
the 23 most important people in the west

21
00:01:19,151 --> 00:01:22,540
wing of the White House were sworn in.
That is the people who would make up the

22
00:01:22,541 --> 00:01:25,060
team that would lie or closest to the 
president,

23
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:26,740
the chief of staff,
press secretary,

24
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,530
National Security Advisor,
director of communications,

25
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:31,300
etc. Etc.
Etc.

26
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,193
That is all of those people that we 
normally see next to the president's on 

27
00:01:34,601 --> 00:01:36,640
tv shows and movies.
Of coursE,

28
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:38,770
dev you have president trump isn't 
president.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,633
Bartlet and surviving and his 
administration is becoming more 

30
00:01:41,441 --> 00:01:44,310
difficult than setting up a business in 
nicolas maduro.

31
00:01:44,470 --> 00:01:45,580
Venezuela.
Now,

32
00:01:45,581 --> 00:01:46,414
waiT a minute,
maybe you don't know who president 

33
00:01:47,321 --> 00:01:48,820
josiah bartlet is.
Well,

34
00:01:48,821 --> 00:01:50,320
maybe I haven't seen the west wing.
Well,

35
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:52,000
if that's the case and you like 
politics,

36
00:01:52,001 --> 00:01:53,710
which you probably do,
you're watching this channel.

37
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:56,560
Don't waste another minute and go check 
out that show,

38
00:01:56,561 --> 00:01:57,394
but let's stay on track here.
Let's get back to donald trump's white 

39
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:01,264
house.

40
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:10,953
Can you guess how many of those 23 
people who formed the president's 

41
00:02:13,271 --> 00:02:16,720
praetorian guard when his term began are
still in office to date?

42
00:02:16,721 --> 00:02:18,850
Well,
out of those 23,

43
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,010
only nine are still in their post.
Sam's.

44
00:02:21,011 --> 00:02:23,560
Many of those nine are on the chopping 
block.

45
00:02:23,620 --> 00:02:25,090
Okay,
so you might be thinking,

46
00:02:25,091 --> 00:02:27,130
well,
maybe he didn't choose the right.

47
00:02:27,131 --> 00:02:29,380
I mean anyone can make a mistake.
Well,

48
00:02:29,410 --> 00:02:32,290
the problem is that that is not the 
case.

49
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:35,710
A tall Katherine Dunn 10 per se,
researcher at the brookings institute,

50
00:02:35,711 --> 00:02:39,910
one of the most important think tanks in
Washington is following the changes that

51
00:02:39,911 --> 00:02:40,744
are taking place almost every week in 
the president's executive office and 

52
00:02:43,811 --> 00:02:44,644
listen to it.
If we take all the appointed positions 

53
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:49,330
into accounts and those you've been 
replaced,

54
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,193
dismissed or resigned as well as the 
people who worked for them in total 

55
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:53,733
until now,
65 people have been passed of the 

56
00:02:55,571 --> 00:03:00,571
president's office.
That is a eight percenT turnoVer rate.

57
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,983
That means that in just over a year,
half of the people who were part of the 

58
00:03:04,781 --> 00:03:06,520
team and no longer in office,

59
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,383
yes,

60
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,460
an unprecedented rotation race,
the scandals,

61
00:03:13,461 --> 00:03:16,370
disagreements with the president or 
simply the oval office tenants,

62
00:03:16,371 --> 00:03:17,204
mood swings have led to working in the 
west wing becoming a high risk 

63
00:03:19,701 --> 00:03:20,534
profession.

64
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,020
TO give you an idea,
layoffs,

65
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:31,854
resignations,
and changes are happening at a speed 

66
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,373
three times greater than in the obama 
administration and two times greater 

67
00:03:37,291 --> 00:03:38,124
than in reagan's suit.
You still hold the record and we're 

68
00:03:39,751 --> 00:03:42,690
really not inflating this by just 
talking about small posts.

69
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,553
In the last year,
trump has replaceD two press 

70
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:47,160
secretaries,
two chiefs of staff to national security

71
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:47,994
advisors,
and five different people have been 

72
00:03:49,801 --> 00:03:52,500
appointed as director of communications 
in this time,

73
00:03:52,501 --> 00:03:53,334
Donald Trump has even fired as lawyers 
and what's worse based on the available 

74
00:03:56,791 --> 00:03:57,624
information,
things seem to be heading in an even 

75
00:03:59,131 --> 00:04:00,630
worse direction.
For example,

76
00:04:00,631 --> 00:04:01,464
the national security advisor,
general mcmaster hasn't just been fired 

77
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,980
since everything points to the fact that
the general John Kelly has current chief

78
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:11,190
of staff will follow in his footsteps.
In a very short time,

79
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,390
trump has decided to remove his national
security advisor.

80
00:04:15,450 --> 00:04:16,283
Donald trump chooses them,
and then he seems to change his mind 

81
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:20,430
really quickly.
So with this scenario in mind,

82
00:04:20,431 --> 00:04:22,650
so we can understand why many of us team
members,

83
00:04:22,651 --> 00:04:23,484
based on what they confessed,
spends a great deal of time trying not 

84
00:04:26,161 --> 00:04:28,230
to provoke a presidents who gets angry 
very,

85
00:04:28,231 --> 00:04:29,070
very easily.
Now,

86
00:04:29,071 --> 00:04:29,904
many people would probably imagine trump
walking the halls of the white house 

87
00:04:31,681 --> 00:04:32,514
saying to people that you have five,
but maybe this isn't actually that far 

88
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:35,580
from the truth.
Yes,

89
00:04:35,581 --> 00:04:38,610
it does seem as if trump took his 
position on the apprentice to hot,

90
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:41,040
where he basically fired people every 
week.

91
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:43,760
You're fired,
you're fired,

92
00:04:44,140 --> 00:04:45,290
bradford,
you're fired.

93
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:48,500
Can I say it as a joke sometimes that 
derek,

94
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:50,930
you're fired.
You're fired.

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,040
Eight matter yet,
he Better otherwise.

96
00:04:54,050 --> 00:04:54,883
I'll say,
tom,

97
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,830
you're fired.
You're fired.

98
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,730
Devastating.
No business can handle this much less.

99
00:05:01,731 --> 00:05:02,564
The government,
it's supposed to be about stability and 

100
00:05:04,341 --> 00:05:06,920
continuity.
That's just not in his lexicon.

101
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,010
William m daily,
former president barack obama's chief of

102
00:05:10,011 --> 00:05:11,150
staff,
but all right,

103
00:05:11,151 --> 00:05:12,470
so you might be wondering,
well,

104
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:15,950
what's really going on here?
Why are there so many changes?

105
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,360
Well,
there are many reasons.

106
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:23,273
So on the fence and leave due to 
scandals such as the national security 

107
00:05:25,651 --> 00:05:28,170
advisor,
Michael Flynn or staff secretary,

108
00:05:28,171 --> 00:05:29,004
rob porter,
who resigned after domestic abuse 

109
00:05:30,601 --> 00:05:31,434
allegations

110
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,870
today,
former national security advisor,

111
00:05:34,871 --> 00:05:35,704
Michael Flynn,
appeared in federal court and pleaded 

112
00:05:37,091 --> 00:05:37,924
guilty to lying to the fbi about his 
conversations with russia's ambassador 

113
00:05:40,991 --> 00:05:42,670
during the transition last december.

114
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,623
Staff secretary rob porter,
who announced his resignation yesterday 

115
00:05:46,661 --> 00:05:50,320
and then domestic abuse allegations is 
now officially out.

116
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:54,590
This

117
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,650
was also bannon's case until August,
2017.

118
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,620
He was donald trump's right hand man in 
his political career,

119
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,280
but not even that saved him known for is
highly nationalist position.

120
00:06:04,281 --> 00:06:07,880
Steve bannon was named senior counselor 
to the president and chief strategist of

121
00:06:07,881 --> 00:06:10,610
the white house swell.
After a little over six months,

122
00:06:10,611 --> 00:06:12,420
trump sided to kick him out.
In the end,

123
00:06:12,540 --> 00:06:15,620
bannon stepped forward and submitted a 
forced resignation.

124
00:06:16,910 --> 00:06:17,743
Others such as the economic advisor runs
former goldman sachs executive gary 

125
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:23,300
cohn,
or press secretary sean spicer,

126
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:24,160
left.
Because of that,

127
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,270
disagreements with the president's many 
others.

128
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:27,920
Well,
they were directly fired.

129
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:28,813
Ten days on the job that makes anthony 
scaramucci the shortest tenured 

130
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:34,910
communications director in the history 
of the white house.

131
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:37,340
Trump's personal assistant,
john mcentee,

132
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:40,070
fired over security issue.
Then there are other cases,

133
00:06:40,071 --> 00:06:43,400
for example,
emma amanda goals here until December,

134
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,233
2017 was assistant to the president and 
director of communications for the 

135
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:48,260
office of public liaison.
See,

136
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:51,200
omarosa was basically known for 
participating in television.

137
00:06:51,201 --> 00:06:52,034
Reality shows,
one of which was the apprentice where 

138
00:06:53,601 --> 00:06:55,310
she met Donald Trump,
and thanks to that,

139
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,520
she became part of the president's team 
when he arrived at the white house.

140
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:03,570
I think I've won every reality tv a war.
It's like reality star,

141
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,780
the year reality villain.
Best catfight,

142
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:11,140
most dramatic momeNt.
Most google moment.

143
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,453
I mean,
I was in a field that was driven by 

144
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,600
ratings and you know what drives 
ratings?

145
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,793
conflict.

146
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:20,430
Well,
in december of 2017,

147
00:07:20,431 --> 00:07:21,264
she suddenly resigned stating that had 
seen very strange things that had Made 

148
00:07:24,421 --> 00:07:27,360
her feel very uncomfortable and had 
effected her emotionally.

149
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,233
Omarosa was fired three times on the 
apprentice and this was the fourth time 

150
00:07:31,981 --> 00:07:32,814
we let her go.
And do you know what she did after 

151
00:07:34,051 --> 00:07:35,010
resigning?
Well,

152
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:35,873
nothing less than joining the celebrity.
Big brother show where she has been 

153
00:07:38,731 --> 00:07:41,310
entering all that she saw as a white 
house employee,

154
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:42,603
haunted my tweet.
And eVery single day like what is he 

155
00:07:44,561 --> 00:07:45,394
going to tweak?
You would be worried about pens and 

156
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,350
dream.
I'm christian,

157
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,273
I love jesus.
But he thinks jesus tells him to say 

158
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,930
things like jesus.
I say that.

159
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,770
So apparently Donald Trump has an 
amazing eye for recreating great job.

160
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:05,970
Really?
But okay.

161
00:08:05,971 --> 00:08:07,800
Okay.
Now some of you might be thinking,

162
00:08:07,801 --> 00:08:09,090
well,
yes simon.

163
00:08:09,091 --> 00:08:12,340
The thing with is west wing team has 
gotten a bit out of hand,

164
00:08:12,341 --> 00:08:15,090
sparse at the governmental level,
things must be different,

165
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:15,983
right?
Well,

166
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:17,670
it doesn't actually seem.
So.

167
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:40,260
The cabiNet,
the cabinet,

168
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:42,990
the body that is made up of the main 
positions of the us.

169
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:45,930
Government's hasn't been saved from the 
trump earthquake either.

170
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,270
See,
in june of 2017,

171
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:50,460
the first meeting was held with the 
entire cabinet.

172
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:51,323
At that time,
trump publicly stated that he had 

173
00:08:52,561 --> 00:08:55,890
assembled an extraordinary group of 
talents to his government.

174
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,240
Well,
to say the least.

175
00:08:57,270 --> 00:08:58,103
Things have changed since then.
There've been six cabinet rotations 

176
00:09:02,911 --> 00:09:03,744
that's more than George Bush had in his 
two terms in office and it's more than 

177
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,193
half the diploma had in a single year of
these exchanges incidentally for were 

178
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:13,290
redundant dismissals or resignations 
that have rains,

179
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:14,370
priebus,
tom price,

180
00:09:14,371 --> 00:09:15,790
david shulkin,
the last time,

181
00:09:15,791 --> 00:09:17,530
the most surreal of that being rex 
tillerson,

182
00:09:17,531 --> 00:09:18,364
the secretary of state,
and previously powerful ceo of exxon 

183
00:09:20,851 --> 00:09:21,684
mobile,
the largest oil company in the United 

184
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:24,151
States,
rex tillerson,

185
00:09:24,151 --> 00:09:26,150
dvo you might remember,
was fired through twitter.

186
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:30,400
Trump didn't even tell them in person.
In fact,

187
00:09:30,401 --> 00:09:32,350
it's ruined that skipping the 
president's orders,

188
00:09:32,351 --> 00:09:34,660
John Kelly,
trump's chief of staff called tillison,

189
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:35,523
who was touring africa to tell him that 
the president was going to kick him out 

190
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,660
and that he needed to return to 
Washington and consider resigning.

191
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:42,460
It isn't clear whether telus and didn't 
want to,

192
00:09:42,461 --> 00:09:44,350
didn't believe him or didn't have the 
time,

193
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:46,510
but the fact is the trump fired him on 
twitter.

194
00:09:48,830 --> 00:09:49,663
Now,
rumors about who trump is going to find 

195
00:09:50,811 --> 00:09:53,740
next are growing like crazy.
then carson,

196
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:55,340
secretary of housing,
ron zinke,

197
00:09:55,341 --> 00:09:56,174
secretary of the interior,
Scott Pruitt to director of the 

198
00:09:57,801 --> 00:10:00,800
environmental protection agency and the 
powerful Jeff sessions,

199
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:04,070
the attorney general of the big 
favorites for the next firing.

200
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,933
By the way,
the last of the attorney general jeff 

201
00:10:06,381 --> 00:10:07,214
sessions is being blamed by trump pinata
having halted the investigations on the 

202
00:10:10,701 --> 00:10:11,534
russian interference issue in the 
presidential elections that led him to 

203
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:15,800
the white house.
Trump is fed up.

204
00:10:15,801 --> 00:10:18,500
He knoWs who the president is.
He knows he's the boss.

205
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,580
I mean,
what are they thinking?

206
00:10:19,581 --> 00:10:22,910
How can the fbi or the justice 
department to try to investigate him?

207
00:10:22,911 --> 00:10:23,744
I mean,
how dare they independence will have 

208
00:10:25,401 --> 00:10:26,234
none of that.
Thank you very much and pay attention 

209
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:27,891
here,
dear viewer,

210
00:10:27,891 --> 00:10:29,790
because trump is a really forward 
thinking guy.

211
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:30,890
That is why he is fired.

212
00:10:30,890 --> 00:10:33,920
James comey or andrew macabe format fbI 
directors,

213
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:36,200
and for that same reason he stated the 
Robert Mueller,

214
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,034
the special counsel who's investigating 
russia's interference in the elections 

215
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:40,573
is next to be fired.
This is something that even made a 

216
00:10:43,071 --> 00:10:43,904
republican senator jeff flake from 
Arizona publicly warned the presidents 

217
00:10:46,710 --> 00:10:48,350
without his possible dismissal.
Yep.

218
00:10:48,410 --> 00:10:49,243
You heard that right?
You are begging the president not to 

219
00:10:52,311 --> 00:10:55,340
fire the special counsel.
Don't create a constitutional crisis.

220
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,233
Congress cannot preempt to such a firing
or only constitutional remedy is after 

221
00:10:59,571 --> 00:11:02,180
the fact through impeachment.
No one Wants that outcome.

222
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:04,190
Mr. President,
please don't go there.

223
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:06,190
Senator jeff flake wells,
if you have.

224
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,033
these are the reasons why working in the
trump administration is becoming less 

225
00:11:10,611 --> 00:11:13,190
and less attractive even for 
republicans.

226
00:11:13,640 --> 00:11:14,473
There isn't a huge appetite for many 
republicans on the outside to explore 

227
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,490
job opportunities in this 
administration.

228
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,310
Ryan williams,
former spokesmen for mitt romney,

229
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,233
and by the way,
have you noticed the main consequences 

230
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:25,820
of all of this?

231
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:26,653
I mean,
who's going to want to work in this 

232
00:11:27,591 --> 00:11:28,910
administration now?
I mean,

233
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:30,170
think about it.
If you had a good job,

234
00:11:30,171 --> 00:11:31,004
if you had a good position,
would you risk everything's going to 

235
00:11:32,770 --> 00:11:33,603
work in the white house.
I mean you could be fired tomorrow and 

236
00:11:35,601 --> 00:11:36,434
that would be the ends of your 
reputation and your career and maybe 

237
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:42,110
you'd get fired by a tweet.
And the reality is that for many people,

238
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:45,050
they would just say no to working in the
white house.

239
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:45,943
And yes,
the obvious consequence of this is that 

240
00:11:47,091 --> 00:11:49,970
the trump administration might be 
lacking in talent anyways.

241
00:11:49,971 --> 00:11:51,890
If you are,
this is how things are in Washington.

242
00:11:51,891 --> 00:11:55,540
And now consider that trump only been in
the white house for a single year.

243
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:56,403
But now it's your turn.
Who do you think's next up to be fired 

244
00:11:57,851 --> 00:11:58,684
in the white house swelled.

you're fired.
You're fired.
