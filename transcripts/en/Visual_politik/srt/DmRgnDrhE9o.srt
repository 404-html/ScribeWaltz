1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:00,883
More than 250 million people live in a 
country other than the one they were 

2
00:00:04,831 --> 00:00:06,240
born in.
In other words,

3
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:08,970
they're immigrants and if you at this 
number,

4
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:14,030
it doesn't stop growing in the last 50 
years.

5
00:00:17,661 --> 00:00:18,494
It just multiplied by three and only 
since the year 2000 is the number of 

6
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:21,944
immigrants has increased by 80 million.
That's 18 million more people who've 

7
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,060
left their country in search of a better
life.

8
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:34,360
We are the dreamers of USA and as you 
can imagine,

9
00:00:36,251 --> 00:00:37,084
most of the world's immigrants,
more than 65% of settles in the richest 

10
00:00:40,661 --> 00:00:43,210
countries such as the United States,
Germany,

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,680
Australia,
and Canada.

12
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:51,410
I do

13
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:52,243
this precisely at this fact that is 
feeding all over the world 

14
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:56,750
controversial,
furious,

15
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:57,653
and bitter debates on immigration and 
the discourse of many populist movement 

16
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,253
in recent years in Europe for example,
we've seen a lot of populist and Zena 

17
00:01:08,341 --> 00:01:09,174
phobic parties and merging,
which have targeted immigration 

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:16,380
directly.
You've certainly heard it all.

19
00:01:17,661 --> 00:01:20,150
What if they steal our jobs,
put us in danger,

20
00:01:20,151 --> 00:01:22,880
destroy on national identity,
et Cetera,

21
00:01:22,910 --> 00:01:23,990
et Cetera,
et cetera.

22
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:28,820
That's perhaps the most outstanding case
of all of this is Donald Trump.

23
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:31,700
He's made it very clear,
but he is a president who really doesn't

24
00:01:31,701 --> 00:01:36,380
like immigration except you know,
under really certain circumstances,

25
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,473
trump balked at an immigration deal that
would include protections for people 

26
00:01:41,331 --> 00:01:42,164
from Haiti and some nations in Africa.
Demand to know why he should accept 

27
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,610
immigrants from quote whole countries 
rather than from places like

28
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:51,513
Norway.
Why on earth would trump think that 

29
00:01:52,871 --> 00:01:53,704
Norwegians once it emigrate on master 
the United States when they are already 

30
00:01:57,490 --> 00:01:59,590
rich Americans?
In fact,

31
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:03,730
more people are moving from the u s to 
Norway and the other way around.

32
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,593
But let us not straight too far from 
today's topic because what we're really 

33
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:10,780
looking at today is whether immigration 
is actually a danger.

34
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:11,643
Is it a burden on society?
We want to look at whether the United 

35
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:16,083
States is losing economic and momentum 
because of all the immigrants that are 

36
00:02:18,941 --> 00:02:21,820
coming into the country.
We want to look at whether the US should

37
00:02:21,821 --> 00:02:25,340
stop the arrival of more foreigners.
So that's,

38
00:02:25,380 --> 00:02:26,213
that's in,

39
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:30,893
okay.

40
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:36,003
Now,
if there is one thing that we can all 

41
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:38,554
agree on,
it's that we live in an increasingly 

42
00:02:40,031 --> 00:02:43,420
interconnected world that is a world 
where it's becoming easier,

43
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:46,940
faster and cheaper to go from one place 
to another.

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,630
And there's also

45
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:54,590
a world where it's easier to connect 
with our loved ones where they are.

46
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:57,860
And as you can imagine,
all of these things make the decision to

47
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:00,340
pack up and move to another country 
much,

48
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,233
much easier.
That's why if there were 90 million 

49
00:03:03,131 --> 00:03:05,680
immigrants around the world in the 
sixties today,

50
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:10,800
there are more than 250 million.
And you know what?

51
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:18,370
We can only expect this number to grow 
strongly in the upcoming years first.

52
00:03:18,371 --> 00:03:19,204
It's because it's becoming easier to 
move into seconds because of the huge 

53
00:03:21,881 --> 00:03:25,510
demographic growth that many poor 
countries are experiencing.

54
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,381
So Devi,
you are,

55
00:03:26,381 --> 00:03:28,870
the real question that we want to get 
back to is,

56
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:31,060
is there a reason to worry?
Well,

57
00:03:31,061 --> 00:03:31,894
listen up.

58
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,343
Yeah,

59
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,563
a lucky break.

60
00:03:47,780 --> 00:03:48,210
Whenever

61
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,043
rich countries talk about immigration,
it sounds like that debating whether or 

62
00:03:51,811 --> 00:03:55,980
not to engage in some sort of charity 
and then you know what's,

63
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:58,320
nothing could actually be further from 
the truth.

64
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:01,260
Hair,
immigration favors economic growth among

65
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:06,290
other things because most immigrants are
adults of working age four.

66
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:07,823
It's been calculated that since the year
2000 immigrants who have been 

67
00:04:09,931 --> 00:04:14,370
responsible for 40 to 80% of their main 
recipients,

68
00:04:14,371 --> 00:04:17,610
country's workforce growth.
So let's be honest,

69
00:04:17,611 --> 00:04:19,230
without them,
these countries,

70
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:21,000
that'd be far less wealthy.

71
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,730
Bye.

72
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:26,390
Yes,
I know this is all very abstract.

73
00:04:26,420 --> 00:04:27,253
If you want to see exactly how this 
happens in one of the countries where 

74
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,490
immigration has caused a lot of 
controversy.

75
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,353
Well,
let's have a look at the United Kingdom 

76
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:37,223
recent years,
while some political groups warns about 

77
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:39,554
the enormous threats that immigration 
and including immigrants coming from 

78
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:44,720
other European countries posed for 
British jobs,

79
00:04:44,721 --> 00:04:48,350
identity and his way of life.
The truth is that the economy has placed

80
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,740
very,
very different numbers on the team.

81
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:55,493
Never before in history of so many 
people being employed in the United 

82
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:03,150
Kingdom as there are today,
neither in absolute or relative terms

83
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:11,960
I did,
and it

84
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,810
doesn't even matter if we exclude 
immigrants.

85
00:05:14,811 --> 00:05:15,644
Yeah.
Never before as the British population 

86
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:20,180
had as many job opportunities as they do
right now,

87
00:05:22,220 --> 00:05:23,053
and not only that,
it's according to studies from several 

88
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:28,010
British universities,
all these immigrants pay more taxes than

89
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,980
they get in benefits from the state.
And if that weren't enough,

90
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,843
the UK is managing to attract more 
university immigrants than any other 

91
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,130
European country.
In other words,

92
00:05:40,131 --> 00:05:44,090
the effect of this immigration is very,
very positive for the British,

93
00:05:44,091 --> 00:05:48,500
and it's also helping turn the United 
Kingdom into a technological powerhouse.

94
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:49,820
Not Bad.
Right.

95
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,510
Well,
you know what,

96
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:53,690
despite trump's fiery speeches,
but the truth is there's,

97
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:56,810
on the other side of the ponds,
things aren't really any,

98
00:05:57,380 --> 00:05:58,190
listen to this.

99
00:05:58,190 --> 00:05:59,023
I remember

100
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:08,410
the North American dream

101
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:11,240
okay.

102
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,073
With just over 44 million people,
which is more or less the population of 

103
00:06:14,901 --> 00:06:18,020
Spain.
The United States is in absolute terms.

104
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,050
The country with the most immigrants in 
the world.

105
00:06:27,090 --> 00:06:27,923
However,
wait just a moment because in relative 

106
00:06:29,281 --> 00:06:31,140
terms,
things are rather difference.

107
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:36,200
These 44 million people represents just 
under 14% of the entire population.

108
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:37,453
To give you a better idea here,
in countries like Australia or New 

109
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,440
Zealand for example,
the percentage is almost twice as high.

110
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,160
Now here is a big question for you and 
please don't cheat in Google.

111
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,013
That's what impact do you think 
immigration has had on the United 

112
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:58,840
States?
Well,

113
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,673
dear viewer listener,
despite representing just under 14% of 

114
00:07:03,821 --> 00:07:04,654
the population,
immigrants are responsible for almost 

115
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,970
25% of all businesses that have you been
in the United States.

116
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,833
They're also responsible for more than 
30% of the companies in which venture 

117
00:07:13,571 --> 00:07:14,404
capital funds invest as almost half of 
all silicon valley high tech startups 

118
00:07:18,910 --> 00:07:22,810
are started by immigrants and that's 
normal here.

119
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:25,550
According to a study from the Center for
American entrepreneurship,

120
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,433
43% of the 500 largest companies in the 
United States were founded either by 

121
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:33,130
immigrants or the children of 
immigrants.

122
00:07:36,110 --> 00:07:40,640
Three weeks ago we bought another toward
the new low price custom line.

123
00:07:40,641 --> 00:07:41,474
Victoria,

124
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,920
that's 216 companies whose revenues 
surpass it.

125
00:07:49,950 --> 00:07:50,783
$5 trillion every year and employee 
almost 13 million people all around the 

126
00:07:55,201 --> 00:07:56,034
world.

127
00:07:58,490 --> 00:07:58,890
Okay.

128
00:07:58,890 --> 00:08:03,890
We're talking about nearly half of the 
great us economic powerhouse from Henry,

129
00:08:04,141 --> 00:08:07,860
forced to Elon Musk and many of the 
great figures and iconic characters over

130
00:08:07,861 --> 00:08:11,220
the United States.
They weren't even born in that country.

131
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,493
No.

132
00:08:18,290 --> 00:08:18,810
Well,
just a,

133
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:21,000
because I bet something you are probably
thinking right now.

134
00:08:21,001 --> 00:08:21,990
Well,
okay Simon,

135
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:26,100
but those are only a few immigrants,
the most educated ones.

136
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:28,170
What about all of the rest,
Simon?

137
00:08:29,390 --> 00:08:29,730
Okay,

138
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,940
well the truth is the numbers,
they don't very much here either.

139
00:08:32,970 --> 00:08:35,160
That entrepreneurship and employment 
rates,

140
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:36,023
they're also really high and by the way,
they also provide several other 

141
00:08:38,641 --> 00:08:39,750
benefits.
For example,

142
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:42,480
in a country that at the moment has 
pretty much full employment.

143
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,540
New immigrants reinforce the U S is 
competitiveness,

144
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,920
encourage the rest of the American 
population to do more as an alpha.

145
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:52,170
Many businesses that would have 
otherwise not existed to be creative.

146
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,263
In summary,
integralist reduce the populations 

147
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:01,530
average age.
They have more children or more educated

148
00:09:01,531 --> 00:09:04,530
and is more enterprising.
They far more patterns as well.

149
00:09:04,590 --> 00:09:06,960
The list goes on,
and if you think about it for a second,

150
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,260
it does make a lot of sense on the one 
am's.

151
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:12,060
These people arrived,
you achieve a better future.

152
00:09:12,061 --> 00:09:15,000
So they're willing to take risks and 
work really hard.

153
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:16,190
No.
On the other hands,

154
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:17,063
they've had different experiences and 
it's education and they can take 

155
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,800
advantage of this in order to progress 
thing.

156
00:09:22,801 --> 00:09:23,634
For example,
if Italian pizzas aren't Mexican tacos 

157
00:09:25,501 --> 00:09:28,560
that flood for us today as well as the 
rest of the wells.

158
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,423
Well,
despite these arguments and the facts 

159
00:09:31,051 --> 00:09:31,884
that never before have so many Americans
had jobs as politicians like Donald 

160
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:38,580
Trump still don't like immigration.
But you know what?

161
00:09:38,581 --> 00:09:39,414
This isn't the first time that the u s 
political leaders have spoken out 

162
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:42,864
against immigration.
It has become the issue and the 

163
00:09:44,551 --> 00:09:46,260
governor's right.
Pete Wilson,

164
00:09:46,261 --> 00:09:50,130
a one 87 supporter,
is pinning his reelection hopes on Eddie

165
00:09:50,131 --> 00:09:50,964
immigrants.

166
00:09:56,950 --> 00:09:57,820
The precedents.

167
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:03,890
This is by no means that the United 
States,

168
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:04,724
the country of immigrants,
has had political campaigns against 

169
00:10:07,311 --> 00:10:08,144
them.
You see in the middle of the 19th 

170
00:10:08,931 --> 00:10:10,250
century,
the political movement,

171
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,143
no and nothing opposed immigration,
particularly from the Irish and soon 

172
00:10:14,691 --> 00:10:16,850
after if they focused on the Chinese.
Yep.

173
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,710
You heard that,
right?

174
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,520
They,
we're focusing on the Chinese.

175
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,300
During the second half of the 19th 
century,

176
00:10:23,301 --> 00:10:24,134
many of Chinese came to the United 
States and that triggered a rather 

177
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:28,220
hostile,
popular reaction.

178
00:10:29,250 --> 00:10:33,690
Seattle to Los Angeles from Wyoming to 
the small towns of California.

179
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:36,630
Immigrants from China were forced out of
business,

180
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:38,310
run out of town,
beaten,

181
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,690
tortured,
lynched,

182
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:43,050
and massacred usually with little hope 
of help from the law.

183
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,080
Immigration work from the library of 
Congress,

184
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:47,083
all this because at that time Americans 
saw the Chinese as the competition ends 

185
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,843
in 1982 the federal congress itself a 
preview to the law of exclusion of the 

186
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:57,314
Chinese,
which not only suspended the arrival of 

187
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,044
new Chinese immigrants,
but also it made the lives of those who 

188
00:11:02,241 --> 00:11:07,241
were already in the u s Rafa complicated
and bottles and home.

189
00:11:07,430 --> 00:11:08,263
In 1924 after around 30 million people 
who have crossed the Atlantic Ocean to 

190
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,520
reach the u s Washington established a 
quote,

191
00:11:13,521 --> 00:11:17,270
a policy that greatly reduced the number
of immigrants that could arrive and they

192
00:11:17,271 --> 00:11:18,104
also vetoed immigrants from southern 
Europe such as Spain and Italy as well 

193
00:11:20,571 --> 00:11:21,680
as Eastern Europe,
Asia,

194
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:24,470
and Africa.
So basically the few who it ends or they

195
00:11:24,471 --> 00:11:26,120
have to be Anglo saxons.

196
00:11:30,710 --> 00:11:31,110
Hello,
more

197
00:11:31,110 --> 00:11:34,020
recently in 1994 the then governor of 
California,

198
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:34,854
Pete Wilson,
blamed Hispanic immigrants for the 

199
00:11:36,251 --> 00:11:39,750
state's poor economic situation.
And do you want to know what he did?

200
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,613
Well,
he launched a huge political campaign 

201
00:11:42,331 --> 00:11:43,164
against immigration and pushed the so 
called a proposition one eight seven a 

202
00:11:46,381 --> 00:11:51,000
law that prevented access to social,
educational and even health services for

203
00:11:51,001 --> 00:11:53,440
all illegal immigrants.
And yes,

204
00:11:53,441 --> 00:11:54,274
this included children.
It was so aggressive that just a year 

205
00:11:57,370 --> 00:12:00,040
later the supreme court declared it 
unconstitutional.

206
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,053
We are going to think back California 
working tax paying families of this 

207
00:12:06,981 --> 00:12:07,814
state.

208
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,743
Well.
The fact is that despite all these 

209
00:12:11,951 --> 00:12:12,784
campaigns against immigration,
existing research shows that states and 

210
00:12:15,791 --> 00:12:20,050
counties that historically had more 
immigration now have a higher income,

211
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:23,290
less poverty,
less unemployment and better educational

212
00:12:23,291 --> 00:12:25,210
results does that with all this data in 
mind,

213
00:12:25,211 --> 00:12:27,450
it might be good for both the White 
House and the capitol.

214
00:12:27,451 --> 00:12:29,590
It's a focus less on how to deport 
people,

215
00:12:29,591 --> 00:12:30,424
funds more on how to use strength and 
access and Tracy to prove once and for 

216
00:12:33,341 --> 00:12:33,920
all,
hey,

217
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:38,080
migrator reform that facilitates the 
orderly arrival of more people,

218
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:41,050
more workers,
more entrepreneurs and more researches.

219
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,020
All of this would great and the age,
the North American economy,

220
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,220
by the way,
in a future video,

221
00:12:45,221 --> 00:12:49,090
which we'll try to make available very 
soon for our patrion page and later here

222
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:49,983
on this channel,
we're going to discuss the great myths 

223
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,800
that exist about immigration,
but now,

224
00:12:53,830 --> 00:12:54,663
well it's your turn.
Do you think your country should reduce 

225
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:59,470
the entry of immigrants or should they 
increase it?

226
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,333
Well,

234
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:20,473
he dwells in a one 87 supporters is 
pending his reelection hopes on anti

immigrant sentiment.
