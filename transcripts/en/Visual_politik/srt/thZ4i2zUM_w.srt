1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,430
Today.
Let's just jump into the first question.

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:06,540
Do you know how many tourists there were
in 2017 all around the world?

3
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:07,031
Well,
listen,

4
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:07,864
now,
because this number may make more than 

5
00:00:08,671 --> 00:00:13,080
one of you jumped out of your chair.
According to data from the World Tourism

6
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:15,780
Organization,
no less than 1.3 billion people traveled

7
00:00:15,781 --> 00:00:17,330
from 2017 yeah,

8
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:25,980
that's more than 1.3 billion 
international tourists.

9
00:00:26,010 --> 00:00:26,843
As you can imagine,
this gigantic industry generated more 

10
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,350
than one point $2 trillion.
I want to,

11
00:00:32,351 --> 00:00:35,160
we fines when there's so much business.
Well,

12
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,053
of course we find companies,
well in this video we're going to focus 

13
00:00:38,221 --> 00:00:39,054
on one company,
one that was founded in 2008 have two 

14
00:00:41,581 --> 00:00:46,260
young guys who couldn't even pay their 
rents and switch in just 10 years became

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,130
one of the five largest tourist 
corporations in the world.

16
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,023
I'm sure you all know it and I'm sure 
many of you have actually used us 

17
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:56,070
because of course we're talking about 
Airbnb,

18
00:00:56,071 --> 00:01:01,071
the largest accommodation company on the
planet did by Simon's loved by others.

19
00:01:04,411 --> 00:01:05,244
So what's the Eir?
It's true dimensions whilst purpose is 

20
00:01:07,591 --> 00:01:10,620
it trying to achieve and what 
implications does this have?

21
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:12,180
Well,
let's dive in,

22
00:01:12,181 --> 00:01:13,014
shall we?

23
00:01:21,050 --> 00:01:21,883
Yeah.

24
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,900
Everything that has to do with Airbnb is
pretty impressive and no,

25
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,280
I'm really not exaggerating.

26
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:29,173
Yeah.

27
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:32,863
Only being 10 years old,
Abbey and the has managed to become the 

28
00:01:35,461 --> 00:01:38,580
largest Chrism accommodation company in 
the world.

29
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,443
In fact,
it sells more rooms than the next four 

30
00:01:40,861 --> 00:01:45,861
companies in the ranking combined,
Marriott,

31
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,073
Hilton and intercontinental and wisdom,
these are the four largest hotel chains 

32
00:01:50,381 --> 00:01:53,620
in the wells combined.
They have 3.3 million rooms.

33
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,470
Airbnb alone,
there's more than 4 million.

34
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,053
We're actually talking about almost 5 
million rooms spread over more than 190 

35
00:02:03,851 --> 00:02:05,440
countries.
Through this platform.

36
00:02:05,441 --> 00:02:09,450
We can book a room in more than 81,000 
different cities.

37
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,113
These data,
you can imagine the huge panic that 

38
00:02:15,981 --> 00:02:16,814
heavy and B has caused in the boards of 
directors of the largest hotel 

39
00:02:19,691 --> 00:02:20,524
companies.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,430
Sure.

41
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,670
BNB is a mortal threat to the US hotel 
industry.

42
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:25,593
Ian Schrager,
American entrepreneur hotelier and real 

43
00:02:28,121 --> 00:02:29,950
estate developer,
and you know,

44
00:02:29,951 --> 00:02:34,951
the reality is while we have every 
reason to panic since it was launched,

45
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,080
Airbnb as managed 300 million 
reservations,

46
00:02:42,081 --> 00:02:43,890
but if that sounds like a lot,
well,

47
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,724
keep listening because the numbers are 
growing so fast is that the company 

48
00:02:46,981 --> 00:02:51,770
expects to surpass 1 billion 
reservations as of 2028 a year.

49
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:58,183
Wow.

50
00:02:58,350 --> 00:03:00,040
Before we continue,
there is

51
00:03:00,070 --> 00:03:01,720
one note here.
As you may know,

52
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,554
most technology companies lose money,
sometimes a lot of money in the first 

53
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:08,140
years.
This is because they have to spend a lot

54
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,450
to start up the company,
acquire technology,

55
00:03:10,451 --> 00:03:12,070
build a brand,
get customers,

56
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:12,933
et cetera.
That's of course someone has to make 

57
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:16,540
that investment because while at the end
of the day,

58
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:20,470
given minds that many times the founders
of these companies are students,

59
00:03:20,471 --> 00:03:21,910
engineers,
designers,

60
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:25,540
etc. Generally young people who are not 
exactly billion as,

61
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:26,433
that's why in silicon valley it's 
practically throughout the entire 

62
00:03:28,691 --> 00:03:29,524
technological worlds.
There's an instrument that has become 

63
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:34,060
something like the holy grail of the 
industry.

64
00:03:34,090 --> 00:03:38,350
That's the financing round.
Hello.

65
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,183
Let me to explain how this works.
A startup when it's not listed on the 

66
00:03:41,681 --> 00:03:42,514
stock market,
meets with a bunch of venture capital 

67
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:44,824
investors and presents their projects 
and then the investor or investors who 

68
00:03:48,071 --> 00:03:48,904
put money on the table or services such 
as contacts and legal or technological 

69
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,450
support,
they are given a part of the company and

70
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,313
when the startup needs more resources,
they have more financing rounds just 

71
00:04:00,071 --> 00:04:00,904
like this.

72
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:02,393
Yes.

73
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,493
And its latest financing round.
AIRBNB got $1 billion for about 3% of 

74
00:04:11,721 --> 00:04:12,554
its shares.
That means the investors valued the 

75
00:04:14,271 --> 00:04:15,104
entire company at $31 billion.
Not Bad for something that's 10 years 

76
00:04:18,621 --> 00:04:19,070
old.

77
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:19,903
Right.

78
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:24,853
You said that you might now be wondering
how enough did a company founded by two 

79
00:04:28,071 --> 00:04:32,000
young graduates managed to become such a
huge empire in such little time?

80
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,923
Well,
we're going to take a look at this and 

81
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:34,603
where and how it all began.
And I'll tell you now that if the 

82
00:04:36,861 --> 00:04:40,400
current numbers are impressive,
that origins are not far behind.

83
00:04:40,550 --> 00:04:41,383
So listen up

84
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:49,803
the roots.

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:56,670
I imagine it's the year 2007 and your 26
years old,

86
00:04:56,671 --> 00:05:00,570
you've just finished your studies and 
you've moved to seek your fortune in the

87
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,880
Capitol of technological 
entrepreneurship,

88
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:03,753
San Francisco.
But of course you've got to pay a lot's 

89
00:05:05,481 --> 00:05:06,314
to live in such a fashionable city,
so you get an apartment for $1,200 a 

90
00:05:09,991 --> 00:05:12,210
month,
which you can still barely a force.

91
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,320
The question is,
well,

92
00:05:13,350 --> 00:05:14,310
what would you do now?

93
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:18,323
Yeah,

94
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:22,320
well that's precisely the question that 
Brian Chesky and Joe Gibeah to have.

95
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:26,860
Airbnb is three parents to answer.
When an opportunity presented itself,

96
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,560
there was a conference in the city,
a designer's congress,

97
00:05:29,561 --> 00:05:32,470
and the hotels were full.
So if these two guys had an idea,

98
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:33,363
they said,
why don't we buy a couple of their 

99
00:05:34,201 --> 00:05:36,820
mattresses but them in the living room 
and rent them out?

100
00:05:36,890 --> 00:05:38,110
Well,
ask precisely what they did.

101
00:05:38,111 --> 00:05:41,740
They offered a mattress to sleep on and 
breakfast in the morning in exchange for

102
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:42,603
some money,
which they would use to pay their rent 

103
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:44,883
to find customers.
They set up a website app at and 

104
00:05:46,721 --> 00:05:50,380
breakfast dotcom where customers could 
book a mattress in their living room.

105
00:05:50,410 --> 00:05:54,010
They got three customers and made $80 on
the first night of the conference.

106
00:05:54,820 --> 00:05:55,653
Funny.
But we didn't think air bed and 

107
00:05:56,681 --> 00:05:58,220
breakfast would be a big idea.

108
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:59,113
You thought it might be able to pay the 
rent until we could think of the big 

109
00:06:00,921 --> 00:06:01,754
idea.
One thing I learned is big ideas sound 

110
00:06:03,711 --> 00:06:05,880
stupid in the beginning,
Brian Chesky,

111
00:06:05,881 --> 00:06:08,270
the founder and CEO of Airbnb,

112
00:06:08,390 --> 00:06:10,820
well little by little they notice that 
the idea,

113
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:11,683
it wasn't say far fetched in February of
2008 Nathan Bashas can architect by 

114
00:06:15,471 --> 00:06:19,910
profession and joins the project as the 
third co founder and do with that Airbnb

115
00:06:19,911 --> 00:06:20,860
was well on its way.

116
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,110
Oh cool.

117
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,543
It was not going to be easy.
The concept was nearly an embryo and 

118
00:06:29,851 --> 00:06:32,760
idea that many investors thought who is 
completely crazy.

119
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:35,490
Think about it.
I mean it's a service to rent out a bed,

120
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:38,850
an air mattress or even a sofa in a 
stranger's house.

121
00:06:38,851 --> 00:06:41,250
I mean it's a pretty bizarre idea.
So we were,

122
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:44,720
all they had was their credit cards and 
their own ingenuity.

123
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,713
Even said the other day that you would 
not meet a potentially with the prime 

124
00:06:49,071 --> 00:06:49,904
minister of Spain,
I'm not going to shut the White House 

125
00:06:51,801 --> 00:06:54,530
visitors scheduled before.
I'm pressure the United States.

126
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:58,310
I don't even have a seal yet.
You hear one thing and speeches and then

127
00:06:58,311 --> 00:07:02,090
you see a campaign that has the worst 
kind of tactics.

128
00:07:02,150 --> 00:07:04,160
Shame on you,
Barack Obama.

129
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:07,970
You can actually see Russia from land 
here in Alaska.

130
00:07:11,110 --> 00:07:13,770
This first,
a bit of luck came in the summer of 2008

131
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,633
it was the election year and the 
Democratic Party and Republican Party 

132
00:07:16,711 --> 00:07:19,020
primaries coming to an end.
As you know,

133
00:07:19,021 --> 00:07:22,380
they ended with a great convention where
each party appoints the candidates.

134
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:23,303
In this case,
the nominees when Barack Obama and John 

135
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:26,123
Mccain,

136
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:27,440
wow,

137
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,273
do you advertise and raise funds?
They released a breakfast cereal with 

138
00:07:31,071 --> 00:07:33,290
the pictures of the candidates in the 
market.

139
00:07:33,350 --> 00:07:36,710
The best part is they caught the 
attention of venture capital company.

140
00:07:36,740 --> 00:07:39,080
There's only a few months later,
gave them $20,000

141
00:07:41,140 --> 00:07:43,720
from that [inaudible].
That growth was unstoppable,

142
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,100
and today,
a decade later,

143
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:50,050
these two guys who couldn't afford their
rents have more than $3 billion each and

144
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,900
a pen and the ranking of the world's 
richest people.

145
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:53,793
Indeed.
It's a pretty amazing example of the 

146
00:07:55,271 --> 00:07:56,104
American dream coming true.
The fact is that throughout this 

147
00:07:58,241 --> 00:08:00,430
process,
technology played a big role,

148
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:03,400
but so did the philosophy of the project
itself.

149
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:05,080
See,
as I'm sure you all know,

150
00:08:05,081 --> 00:08:06,970
airbnb,
it doesn't own apartments.

151
00:08:06,971 --> 00:08:07,804
It doesn't own hotels.
It's simply an intermediary in a very 

152
00:08:10,361 --> 00:08:11,194
synthetic way.
The idea of the company is something 

153
00:08:13,780 --> 00:08:14,613
like this.

154
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:15,750
Yeah.

155
00:08:15,750 --> 00:08:16,583
In the wells that are many unused 
resources such as empty rooms and empty 

156
00:08:20,101 --> 00:08:20,934
apartments.
So if instead of investing in new 

157
00:08:22,651 --> 00:08:23,484
resources,
we give the owners of those unused 

158
00:08:25,081 --> 00:08:27,960
resources the opportunity to make or 
improve their income,

159
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:30,100
we can invest the money that we have in 
tech

160
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:31,183
Jay,

161
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:34,443
and now airbnb is going a step further.
It wants to do the same with people's 

162
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:38,923
ingenuity.
They've decided to launch an experience 

163
00:08:41,201 --> 00:08:42,034
service.
Allow me to explain how about some 

164
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:45,190
performance and activity.
You like bike riding,

165
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:47,110
visiting monuments,
wine tasting,

166
00:08:47,111 --> 00:08:50,680
whatever has airbnb offers this 
experience to its customers.

167
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:54,070
What are their best known experiences is
the one you're seeing here?

168
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:57,600
It's an adventure in which you can get 
to know the world of wolves.

169
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,470
It's creator has already raised more 
than $300,000.

170
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:12,460
The truth

171
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:16,100
is that if you think about it,
connecting and exploiting under utilized

172
00:09:16,101 --> 00:09:20,270
assets and people services and 
creativity isn't only a great idea.

173
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:21,133
It also implies taking advantage of 
resources in a very efficient way while 

174
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:27,770
generating lots of benefits for society 
that,

175
00:09:27,771 --> 00:09:29,810
hold on a second because you're probably
thinking right now,

176
00:09:29,811 --> 00:09:32,360
benefits society,
airbnb rarely Simon,

177
00:09:32,450 --> 00:09:33,380
I mean the shore,
our road.

178
00:09:33,381 --> 00:09:34,214
Lots of politicians out there who are 
saying that we need to pass the cute or 

179
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:39,230
at least limit these types of companies,
but the reality is yes,

180
00:09:39,231 --> 00:09:41,060
there are benefits and I'm going to tell
you about them.

181
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:48,453
The benefits,

182
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:55,530
why the bad publicity that has been 
having lately and D has brought a lot of

183
00:09:55,531 --> 00:09:57,690
benefits to society as a whole.
The one,

184
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,240
it's making travel more affordable for 
everyone.

185
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:01,973
For example,
in the u s the average rooms offered by 

186
00:10:03,991 --> 00:10:04,824
this platform are between 35% and 47% 
cheaper than the average rooms offered 

187
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,300
by hotels in the same city.
They have a much wider offer.

188
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:18,700
You can find almost anything that suits 
your preferences on Airbnb,

189
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:19,673
even if,
I don't know if you wanted perhaps a 

190
00:10:21,121 --> 00:10:21,954
tree house.

191
00:10:23,630 --> 00:10:24,060
Okay,

192
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,170
sneak.
This is a pretty inexhaustible source of

193
00:10:26,171 --> 00:10:27,220
wealth,
more tourism,

194
00:10:27,221 --> 00:10:28,900
more services,
more jobs.

195
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:29,763
In fact,
this platform is user spends on average 

196
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,700
twice as much as other tourists.

197
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:35,800
Okay.

198
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,633
Perhaps and Andy's greatest overall 
benefit has been that it's allowed 

199
00:10:39,371 --> 00:10:40,204
hundreds of thousands of people,
usually middle class people to become 

200
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,340
real entrepreneurs in the tourism 
sector,

201
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,693
thanks to Airbnb.
Many families that had free rooms or an 

202
00:10:51,801 --> 00:10:52,634
apartment or bought an old one to 
restore it and exploited now have a new 

203
00:10:55,971 --> 00:10:58,520
source of income since it was launched 
to the posts.

204
00:10:58,521 --> 00:10:59,354
The owners who runs their rooms and 
their houses cover received more than 

205
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,990
$41 billion.
And the data,

206
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:04,843
it's very clear about this.
Most of the beneficiaries and middle 

207
00:11:06,871 --> 00:11:11,871
class families and yes,
don't worry.

208
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:21,000
I know that not everything is quite so 
rosy.

209
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,910
AIRBNB has also generated some problems.
For example,

210
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:24,744
in the busiest cities,
average rent has increased and some 

211
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:30,480
neighborhoods have become very busy to 
the displeasure of the kneaders.

212
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,993
Okay.

213
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:38,490
I mean,
aren't city's supposed to be dynamic?

214
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:42,390
Is it bad for city to come alive and 
create jobs and create wealth?

215
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:43,253
Isn't the real problem in how expensive 
houses often driven by politics as we 

216
00:11:46,741 --> 00:11:48,210
saw in this video?
Well,

217
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,073
we're going to talk about that in a 
future video as well because this is 

218
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:54,100
certainly a lot to say about it,
but for now it's your turn.

219
00:11:54,101 --> 00:11:56,110
What do you think should be done with 
airbnb?

220
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,973
Well,
