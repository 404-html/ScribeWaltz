1
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,443
In recent decades,
it has been normal to consider the 

2
00:00:10,741 --> 00:00:11,574
tenants of the White House,
the president of the United States has 

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:18,981
the most powerful person in the world 
give you a things they might be changing

4
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,270
or maybe they've actually already 
changed.

5
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,890
Have you heard about the Chinese 
presidents?

6
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,733
Well,
of course you have because I'm sure 

7
00:00:35,511 --> 00:00:38,300
you're a very avid visual politic view 
app now.

8
00:00:38,301 --> 00:00:39,134
You see Donald Trump himself in 
statements collected by the Washington 

9
00:00:41,690 --> 00:00:42,523
Post describes the Chinese president,
Xi Jinping as the most powerful leader 

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:46,753
that China has had in the last century,
which is as good as saying that Xi 

11
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:52,610
Jinping is the most powerful Chinese 
leader of all time.

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:57,763
More and more analysts wondering if he 
isn't in fact the most powerful 

13
00:01:00,841 --> 00:01:03,000
political leader in the world.
Yes,

14
00:01:03,060 --> 00:01:07,240
it's true now while trying is economy 
and its army are still on a second level

15
00:01:07,241 --> 00:01:08,074
of to the United States.
Trump seems to consistently be losing 

16
00:01:10,951 --> 00:01:13,980
his influence over the world and indeed 
his own country,

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:17,130
and so when you go over to China,
you can see that the situation is pretty

18
00:01:17,131 --> 00:01:18,930
much the opposite.
We'll wait,

19
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:19,321
wait,
wait,

20
00:01:19,321 --> 00:01:19,620
wait,
wait.

21
00:01:19,620 --> 00:01:21,750
Trump is losing his influence in the US.
I mean,

22
00:01:21,751 --> 00:01:24,030
how could this possibly be the case?
He wants to be.

23
00:01:24,031 --> 00:01:24,864
Everyone's friends.
Have one scene is rather sweet tweets 

24
00:01:26,901 --> 00:01:27,734
lately.

25
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:31,763
Why would Kim Jong UN insult me by 
calling me old when I would never call 

26
00:01:35,491 --> 00:01:36,810
him short and fat?
Oh,

27
00:01:36,811 --> 00:01:39,480
well,
I try so hard to be his friend and maybe

28
00:01:39,481 --> 00:01:41,040
someday that will happen.
Yes.

29
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:41,903
It's definitely no surprise that the 
United States is losing its influence 

30
00:01:44,611 --> 00:01:45,444
over the world in just a few months.
Trump has gone from nuclear war to 

31
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,220
school,
the odd fights.

32
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,000
All right.
Anyway,

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,700
back to the serious stuff.
The fact is that although Tszujing thing

34
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,920
isn't the president of the world's 
leading power,

35
00:01:55,921 --> 00:01:58,500
he does control China's leadership 
tightly,

36
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,440
a country which is one of the most 
important economic engines on the

37
00:02:02,950 --> 00:02:03,783
onyx.

38
00:02:08,870 --> 00:02:09,703
Of course for Beijing.
Trump has been something like the 

39
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,853
lottery Jackpot.
Nationalism and Donald Trump's mistakes 

40
00:02:18,481 --> 00:02:19,314
have allowed Xi Jinping,
the president of the world's largest 

41
00:02:21,631 --> 00:02:22,464
dictatorship to present his candidacy,
has this sort of global political 

42
00:02:25,621 --> 00:02:26,700
leader.
In January,

43
00:02:26,701 --> 00:02:27,534
2017 of the Davis Forum,
Xi Jinping promised that China would 

44
00:02:30,601 --> 00:02:33,600
become nothing less than the champion of
globalization,

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:36,930
of free trade and even the fight against
climate change,

46
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:37,823
thus Beijing aspirants,
but its grasp on the terrain that has 

47
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:45,111
been lost by watching it to mention,
well,

48
00:02:46,231 --> 00:02:47,064
you know,
freedom and so all those other sorts of 

49
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:50,790
apparently unimportant things,

50
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:56,470
Adi,
by,

51
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:58,810
by the sun,
Shins are,

52
00:02:58,820 --> 00:02:59,870
you'll push out and

53
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:00,843
comes off.
Now what happened in the last Chinese 

54
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:07,473
Communist Party Congress,
how much power does Xi Jinping have and 

55
00:03:09,491 --> 00:03:10,630
what does he wants?
Well,

56
00:03:10,631 --> 00:03:13,270
we're going to discuss all of this,
but first,

57
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:15,640
let's take a look at China today,

58
00:03:22,300 --> 00:03:24,150
but new China.

59
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,923
You think that China is still a country 
where people live in deplorable 

60
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:30,834
conditions,
breaking them backs been miserable 

61
00:03:32,461 --> 00:03:33,390
wages.
Well,

62
00:03:33,391 --> 00:03:34,224
I'm sorry,
but the reality is you're actually 

63
00:03:34,921 --> 00:03:35,754
pretty wrong.
If you think that 2018 will be the 40th 

64
00:03:38,131 --> 00:03:41,610
anniversary of China's reform and open 
policy in this country.

65
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:46,410
It's changed a lot in that time.
China is no longer a low income country,

66
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,130
but indeed a middle income country

67
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:49,083
tree

68
00:03:55,580 --> 00:03:59,930
taking price differences into account is
it that purchasing power parity of about

69
00:03:59,931 --> 00:04:00,764
$16,000,
which is bigger than both Columbia and 

70
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,680
Brazil,
comedy has changed and nowadays services

71
00:04:10,751 --> 00:04:15,751
are the most important activity example 
in electronic commerce,

72
00:04:17,901 --> 00:04:18,734
the sector in which the country is 
beating Europe and even the United 

73
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:25,070
States.
China represents no less than 40 percent

74
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:25,993
of all global transactions.
The same can be said of a mobile 

75
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:29,594
payments which is so popular in this 
country that it's market reached five 

76
00:04:31,881 --> 00:04:32,714
point $5,000,000,000,000 in 2016,
which is 50 times more than the United 

77
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:42,910
States could be described as.
Not Bad.

78
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,830
I mean that growth has been so large,
but just in the last six years,

79
00:04:53,831 --> 00:04:54,664
China's private consumption is growing 
by two point $5,000,000,000,000 and 

80
00:04:57,171 --> 00:05:00,640
announced that equals India's entire 
GDP.

81
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,533
Therefore,
when you visit one of those giant 

82
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:03,663
Chinese cities,
it's not at all uncommon to find a city 

83
00:05:05,651 --> 00:05:07,900
full of skyscrapers,
billionaires,

84
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,823
and high speed trains.
Hold on just a second because China's 

85
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:12,753
poverty continues and in general,
there is a really large difference 

86
00:05:15,761 --> 00:05:17,650
between the countries,
cities and the countries,

87
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,980
rural areas which remained poor,
very poor.

88
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:26,160
In fact,
they're so poor that 43 million people,

89
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,770
almost the entire population of Spain,
by the way,

90
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:33,390
still live in extreme poverty,
earning less than $1 a day,

91
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:34,313
and not only that,
almost 40 percent of Chinese people 

92
00:05:36,361 --> 00:05:37,194
still live at fairly low economic level.
Although the situation is much better 

93
00:05:40,741 --> 00:05:41,940
than a few decades ago.

94
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,690
This is all true,
but as I said before,

95
00:05:46,691 --> 00:05:47,524
things are changing very quickly and we 
can no longer think of China as we did 

96
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,030
2010,
even just five years ago.

97
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:00,110
Way

98
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,250
You talking about poverty is an 
interesting fact.

99
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:06,220
Do you know how the Chinese government 
fights against poverty?

100
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:07,143
Well,
one of its main strategies is actually 

101
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:11,980
creating new businesses and cooperatives
in the poorest of communities.

102
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:12,843
To this ends.
The government has granted almost 

103
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:14,674
$400,000,000,000 in small loans to help 
launch several companies and they not 

104
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:21,060
only focus on money,
but also unculture.

105
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,323
The evening news is filled with tales of
rejuvenated communities and villagers 

106
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:26,284
turned entrepreneurs heaping praise on 
Mr c dot and the government for 

107
00:06:28,841 --> 00:06:32,290
providing loans and new apartments.
Javier Hernandez,

108
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,420
China correspondent for the New York 
Times.

109
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:38,081
Yes,
yes.

110
00:06:38,081 --> 00:06:38,914
I know Xi Jinping in practically every 
country leader talk a lot about Chinese 

111
00:06:42,521 --> 00:06:43,354
style socialism.
The truth is that this is just a 

112
00:06:45,461 --> 00:06:49,030
reference to a kind of capitalist model 
locked up within a dictatorship.

113
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,790
China isn't an ideological dictatorship,
Norris,

114
00:06:51,791 --> 00:06:55,330
socialist or communist one.
It's just simply a dictatorship.

115
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:56,223
Having said that,
now let's talk a little bit about aging 

116
00:06:58,031 --> 00:06:58,864
thing.
The person leading this new China with 

117
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:05,970
almost total power CGMP,
the leader

118
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,890
born in 1953.
We could say that Xi Jinping is a pretty

119
00:07:16,891 --> 00:07:18,570
interesting dude.
On the one hand,

120
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,840
he's probably the Chinese leader who's 
had the most contact with the West.

121
00:07:21,870 --> 00:07:24,750
His daughter studied at Harvard.
His sister even lives in Canada,

122
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:27,720
and he has visited the United States 
several times.

123
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,613
In fact,
in 2012 when he visited the United 

124
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:34,140
States as vice president of China,
he made a somewhat peculiar stop.

125
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:35,730
He went to Iowa.
Well,

126
00:07:35,731 --> 00:07:37,050
at this point you're probably wondering,
well,

127
00:07:37,051 --> 00:07:38,550
why did he go to Iowa?
Well,

128
00:07:38,551 --> 00:07:41,670
the fact is that in 1985 when she drink 
thing was a young party,

129
00:07:41,671 --> 00:07:42,504
county secretary in China,
he traveled to Iowa to investigate 

130
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:45,743
agriculture related issues,
so in 2010 we went to see the family 

131
00:07:48,751 --> 00:07:51,690
that had stayed with at the time and he 
brought them presence.

132
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:52,620
Pretty cool,
right?

133
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,790
In addition,
the president,

134
00:07:53,791 --> 00:07:56,040
she's Yankee side.
It doesn't end there.

135
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:58,530
He's also known to love Hollywood 
movies.

136
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,920
There is also another side to this since
he became China's highest authority five

137
00:08:04,921 --> 00:08:05,754
years ago because government has been 
characterized for having the most 

138
00:08:07,831 --> 00:08:10,860
censorship and repression for a very 
long time.

139
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,980
We only need to take a look at the 
latest cybersecurity law,

140
00:08:13,981 --> 00:08:14,814
which seeks to control even more of the 
Internet in China by restricting 

141
00:08:17,911 --> 00:08:22,140
anonymity in doing this is to such an 
extent that also social network accounts

142
00:08:22,141 --> 00:08:25,260
have to be backed by ANA identifying 
citizen further.

143
00:08:25,261 --> 00:08:28,050
It's been decades since China saw such a
strong leader.

144
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,680
We could say that all this propaganda as
well,

145
00:08:29,681 --> 00:08:30,514
it greatly,
but that's not really surprising now is 

146
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,084
that

147
00:08:38,730 --> 00:08:39,030
the fact

148
00:08:39,030 --> 00:08:39,863
is that in these five years,
Xi Jinping has made several changes in 

149
00:08:42,331 --> 00:08:46,590
China starting with the army reform and 
they're very active foreign policy.

150
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:47,483
We saw it here at visual politic,
how Xi Jingping has done invested 

151
00:08:49,921 --> 00:08:52,110
national resources towards foreign 
policy.

152
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,003
A good example is this new silk road 
macro project which aims to invest 

153
00:08:55,801 --> 00:08:58,620
hundreds of billions of dollars in 
several countries,

154
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,483
but generally that greatest commitments 
has definitely been the fight against 

155
00:09:02,881 --> 00:09:05,150
corruption and this is seriously,
yeah,

156
00:09:06,650 --> 00:09:07,483
sure.

157
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:08,393
Aging thing came to power.
If a one and a half million members of 

158
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,184
the Communist Party have been sanctioned
and nearly 300,000 different 

159
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:15,493
prosecutors,
including 43 members of the central 

160
00:09:17,611 --> 00:09:18,444
committee,
there's more within the framework of 

161
00:09:19,921 --> 00:09:22,620
this fight against corruption.
$13,000.

162
00:09:22,630 --> 00:09:23,463
The officers have been dismissed and 
it's more than 50 generals have been in 

163
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,720
prisons.
Of course,

164
00:09:27,721 --> 00:09:28,554
as you might expect.
Not everyone sees this battle as clean 

165
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:31,404
and honest.
It's a selective anticorruption 

166
00:09:34,201 --> 00:09:35,034
campaign.
It's nature is the selective protection 

167
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,480
of corruption.
When you purge some corrupt officials,

168
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,433
you're protecting the others,
you protect the corrupt system and you 

169
00:09:42,691 --> 00:09:46,440
protect correct people who support you 
about tall Chinese activist.

170
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:47,513
Yes.
Xi Jinping has mostly relieved his 

171
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:51,660
political rivals.
Coincidence,

172
00:09:51,750 --> 00:09:52,583
of course.
It's very clear that teaching thing has 

173
00:09:53,491 --> 00:09:55,560
gained a lot of power in these five 
years.

174
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:59,280
This was certainly observed in the last 
Chinese Communist Party Congress,

175
00:09:59,281 --> 00:10:01,410
the most important political event in 
the country,

176
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,000
which is held every five years.

177
00:10:03,030 --> 00:10:03,863
Yes,

178
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,290
19th congress.

179
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:14,483
The Chinese Communist Party,
Congress held between October the 18th 

180
00:10:17,061 --> 00:10:17,894
and 24th 2017 was quite peculiar,
especially because it may have been the 

181
00:10:21,801 --> 00:10:25,880
most austere congress that the Chinese 
Communist Party is celebrated in many,

182
00:10:25,970 --> 00:10:27,680
many years.
On this occasion,

183
00:10:27,681 --> 00:10:29,670
some amenities,
they were removed out.

184
00:10:29,690 --> 00:10:30,620
Some examples.
Well,

185
00:10:30,621 --> 00:10:33,490
among other things,
there was no lavish buffets.

186
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:36,680
There was no hairdressing facials and 
tailoring services.

187
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,990
I mean,
all of these used to be offered for free

188
00:10:38,991 --> 00:10:41,390
to participants and it's almost become a
tradition,

189
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:42,253
but if this was the congress at which Xi
Jinping's adoration reached its highest 

190
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:47,390
point,
something that,

191
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,313
as you can imagine in China,
means being put on an almost now like 

192
00:10:51,471 --> 00:10:54,380
level years ago.

193
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:57,500
I said he would be China's most powerful
leader since dms helping.

194
00:10:57,680 --> 00:10:58,513
I was wrong.
He is now China's most powerful leader 

195
00:11:00,331 --> 00:11:04,460
since Kevin Rudd,
Australia's former prime minister.

196
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,353
See,
this congress led to the decision that 

197
00:11:06,651 --> 00:11:07,484
these so called Xi Jinping thought 
should be included in the communist 

198
00:11:10,551 --> 00:11:14,030
party constitution.
This may seem a bit strange,

199
00:11:14,031 --> 00:11:17,390
but it actually means that Xi Jinping is
no longer just another leader.

200
00:11:17,391 --> 00:11:18,224
He is in fact the leader,
the leader whose words formed the 

201
00:11:21,081 --> 00:11:25,700
parties own ideology.
It means see is essentially unassailable

202
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:26,780
if you challenge.
See,

203
00:11:26,830 --> 00:11:27,663
you are challenging the party and you 
would never want to be against the 

204
00:11:29,391 --> 00:11:30,440
party.

So far,

206
00:11:33,081 --> 00:11:36,110
only males and Dong has received such an
honor in life,

207
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:36,973
but that's not all.
Apparently a president's mandate is 

208
00:11:38,661 --> 00:11:39,494
limited to 10 years,
which means that this would be Xi 

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,740
Jinping's last time,
but during the military,

210
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:46,700
because no successor was considered 
during the congress,

211
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:47,563
which leads us to believe that Xi 
Jinping may be at least aspiring to a 

212
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:51,944
third term Chinese universities 
scrambled to open centers to study 

213
00:11:59,401 --> 00:12:01,800
president and Ping thought,
but anyway,

214
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,693
but he owns the Chinese border.
This congress helps define three major 

215
00:12:05,461 --> 00:12:07,980
priorities for the Chinese government in
upcoming years.

216
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:09,180
First,
there's the economy,

217
00:12:09,181 --> 00:12:12,100
which means fighting poverty and opening
up more to the world.

218
00:12:12,150 --> 00:12:12,983
Seconds,
there's the idea of launching even 

219
00:12:14,311 --> 00:12:16,440
stronger foreign policies.
And third,

220
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:19,270
start worrying about the environments 
and you know,

221
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,123
even though I said there were three 
priorities that is kind of a fourth and 

222
00:12:22,621 --> 00:12:23,454
it's actually a pretty clear one.
And that's consolidate the communist 

223
00:12:26,041 --> 00:12:26,930
party's power.

224
00:12:29,430 --> 00:12:33,930
And this is because we know two things 
for sure on the one hand that Xi Jinping

225
00:12:33,931 --> 00:12:36,990
and the Chinese Communist Party will 
stay for a long time.

226
00:12:37,050 --> 00:12:37,883
And on the other hand,
China will reclaim its role as a 

227
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:42,120
superpower.
So the reality is we're going to have to

228
00:12:42,121 --> 00:12:45,390
get used to taking Beijing into accounts
and now it's your turn.

229
00:12:45,391 --> 00:12:47,790
We've got an important question.
Who Do you think will leave power first?

230
00:12:47,791 --> 00:12:50,370
Will it be Xi Jinping or Vladimir Putin?
Well,

231
