1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,923
When thinking about taxes you might 
think of country music Westons George 

2
00:00:04,231 --> 00:00:07,540
Bush and a certain ranger will be 
aimless.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,940
However Texas is far more than these 
overused cliches.

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,233
Frank.

5
00:00:15,770 --> 00:00:16,603
In the last few years Texas has become 
one of the most important drivers of 

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,460
higher U.S.
economy.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:26,030
And Texas is what we're going to be 
telling you about in this video.

8
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:34,463
With over 270000 square miles.
Texas is 3 times the size of the entire 

9
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:41,033
United Kingdom.
In addition to that Texas is one of the 

10
00:00:43,741 --> 00:00:44,574
largest states in the U.S.
In fact it is the second largest behind 

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:48,433
only Alaska.
Texas is located in the southern region 

12
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:54,060
of the United States known as the Sun 
Belt.

13
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,920
It has a coastline along the Gulf of 
Mexico and also borders Mexico itself.

14
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,990
This border with Mexico stretches for 
over 1200 and 50 miles.

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:05,363
The Lone Star State may strike some as a
hostile wasteland but there is far more 

16
00:01:08,581 --> 00:01:11,340
to it than that there are in fact four 
seasons.

17
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:12,623
The drought the flood the blizzard and 
the tornado season this harsh climate 

18
00:01:17,971 --> 00:01:18,804
has not prevented Texas from becoming 
the 12th largest economy in the entire 

19
00:01:23,731 --> 00:01:24,564
world.
It is also the fastest growing state in 

20
00:01:27,181 --> 00:01:29,400
the United States by population numbers.

21
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,353
It creates the most jobs in the United 
States and is responsible for the most 

22
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:34,523
exports.
Since 2000 the population of Texas has 

23
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:42,410
increased by six million people which is
more than any other states.

24
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:43,393
An additional one point five million 
Americans have moved to Texas in search 

25
00:01:47,391 --> 00:01:48,224
of a better future for many.
Texas has become a place where you go 

26
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,830
when you're looking for a fresh start.

27
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,350
It's a popular place for people to go if
they've lost their job in their states.

28
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,333
According to data published by the U.S.
Census five out of eight of the cities 

29
00:02:08,671 --> 00:02:13,671
that grew the most in the United States 
in 2015 were in Texas.

30
00:02:23,320 --> 00:02:24,153
Additionally 40 percent of the 27 
million people who live in Texas are of 

31
00:02:27,821 --> 00:02:31,600
Latino heritage.
Furthermore it is estimated that by 2020

32
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,300
Hispanics will be the majority in the 
state.

33
00:02:34,390 --> 00:02:38,620
This will make Texas the world's second 
largest economic Hispanic power.

34
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,513
This is only behind California which 
already has a majority Hispanic 

35
00:02:42,431 --> 00:02:43,264
population.

36
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:44,343
Also the Republican candidate for 
governor Greg Abbott has released his 

37
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,460
first television ad and it's in Spanish 
and the 21st century.

38
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:52,413
Texas has led job creation in the United
States in the last 16 years employment 

39
00:02:57,191 --> 00:03:00,910
in Texas has tripled the national 
average in the same period.

40
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:01,803
Texas has created a million more jobs 
than California a state which has 12 

41
00:03:05,381 --> 00:03:06,214
million more people.
Since the beginning of the financial 

42
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:13,060
crisis in December 2007 Texas which 
represents about 8 percent of the U.S.

43
00:03:13,061 --> 00:03:13,894
population has been responsible for one 
out of every four jobs created in the 

44
00:03:18,611 --> 00:03:21,970
country.
So it's no surprise that unemployment is

45
00:03:21,971 --> 00:03:22,804
lower than the U.S.
average and has been that way for the 

46
00:03:24,641 --> 00:03:25,474
last ten years.
Also in the same period Texas's GDP has 

47
00:03:28,331 --> 00:03:29,164
enjoyed a 60 percent growth while the 
rest of the country has had to settle 

48
00:03:31,931 --> 00:03:32,764
for 35 percent.
Also as I was saying earlier it is the 

49
00:03:35,141 --> 00:03:35,974
states that exports the most and 52 of 
the Fortune 500 largest companies are 

50
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:41,283
based in Texas.
Having said all of this is no surprise 

51
00:03:48,081 --> 00:03:52,710
that people consider Texas to be the 
true economic driver of the U.S..

52
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:57,943
Now it is true that Texas has suffered 
because of the fall in oil prices but 

53
00:04:00,801 --> 00:04:05,030
many people believe that due to its 
increasingly diversified economy it will

54
00:04:05,031 --> 00:04:05,864
still lead the way in the United States.
So you might be asking now what exactly 

55
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:15,460
is so special about Texas.
Town planning regulations.

56
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,303
For middle and low income workers the 
best part of Texas is the price of 

57
00:04:22,401 --> 00:04:23,234
housing.
These workers have access to big and 

58
00:04:25,670 --> 00:04:26,503
affordable homes.
This happens because regulation in the 

59
00:04:28,941 --> 00:04:29,774
state is very flexible and it means that
homes can be built but not much more 

60
00:04:32,661 --> 00:04:35,440
than the cost of the labor and net 
component parts.

61
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,463
Between 2001 and 2008 Harris County 
which includes Houston authorized the 

62
00:04:40,671 --> 00:04:41,504
building of 200000 homes.
This is compared to just 16000 in Santa 

63
00:04:45,951 --> 00:04:49,490
Clarita in California which by the way 
includes Silicon Valley.

64
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,560
A new houses being built every five 
acres in Texas.

65
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:03,580
This is compared to one being build 
every 50 in California.

66
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:04,773
This means that even if you make less 
money in Texas you'll probably be able 

67
00:05:07,601 --> 00:05:10,450
to afford a better home.
If you live in that state.

68
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:13,443
University.

69
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:19,570
Texas has been able to develop one of 
the best university systems in the world

70
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:20,613
even though it only has a population of 
27 million people four of the world's 

71
00:05:24,671 --> 00:05:28,420
top 100 universities all located in the 
state.

72
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:29,463
For some perspective on Nasik country 
like Spain which has a far larger 

73
00:05:32,141 --> 00:05:35,320
population it has no universities in the
top 100.

74
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:36,423
The education system in Texas not only 
creates high quality professionals but 

75
00:05:39,941 --> 00:05:43,000
also attracts investments from a lot of 
companies.

76
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,260
Texas.
Regulations.

77
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:48,313
On them all leaving.
Texas is a state where salaries provide 

78
00:05:52,691 --> 00:05:56,980
generally high in value because the cost
of many things in Texas is lower than in

79
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:57,814
other states.
People also have more money in their 

80
00:05:59,411 --> 00:06:03,760
parties because of the lower housing 
prices and the lower taxes in the state.

81
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,380
The taxes are lower because Texas is one
of only seven states that have new state

82
00:06:08,470 --> 00:06:09,303
level income tax as a reference point.
The average family living in Texas 

83
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:14,013
compared to New York will save three 
thousand five hundred dollars per year 

84
00:06:17,651 --> 00:06:20,710
in taxes.
All Things Considered Texas is the fifth

85
00:06:20,711 --> 00:06:23,110
best state for getting the most from 
your salary.

86
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,100
Besides this Texas is considered one of 
the states with the most freedom.

87
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:29,890
It is ranked sic recording to the Fraser
Institute.

88
00:06:30,010 --> 00:06:30,843
This means that it is significantly 
easier to do business in Texas than 

89
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,740
compared to some other states.

90
00:06:40,430 --> 00:06:41,263
Further there are fewer regulations 
around jobs for example in Nevada 

91
00:06:44,810 --> 00:06:45,643
Louisiana or Florida.
The requirement to qualify as an 

92
00:06:47,901 --> 00:06:48,734
interior designer is 2190 hours of work 
and you also have to take a course in 

93
00:06:53,871 --> 00:06:54,704
taxes.
There is no such requirement and anyone 

94
00:06:56,271 --> 00:06:58,580
can go out and become an interior 
designer.

95
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:02,210
As a result of this many millennials 
have been choosing Houston as a place to

96
00:07:02,211 --> 00:07:03,044
set up a business rather than more 
traditional choices like New York City 

97
00:07:06,021 --> 00:07:06,854
or Boston.
Many Americans are starting to think 

98
00:07:08,451 --> 00:07:11,990
that other states could start to emulate
Texas in some ways.

99
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,130
Not only are there the tangible benefits
of running a state in the way Texas does

100
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:18,950
but there are also several cultural 
benefits.

101
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,933
Texas's economic boom has attracted a 
great deal of cultural and ethnic 

102
00:07:23,601 --> 00:07:24,434
diversity contributing to cities like 
Austin becoming a great place for 

103
00:07:27,351 --> 00:07:28,184
musicians and other types of artist.
Texas can teach us that it is possible 

104
00:07:31,281 --> 00:07:32,114
to fight the negative effects of 
globalization as well as the automation 

105
00:07:35,271 --> 00:07:36,104
of jobs by machines and they haven't 
done this by protecting their companies 

106
00:07:39,231 --> 00:07:40,064
from foreign competition.
They've done it by reducing the 

107
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:46,280
obstacles that companies and individuals
face in the state.

108
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,263
Every week businesses lead Californians 
to escape high taxes and strangling 

109
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:56,090
regulations.
They come to Texas because we keep taxes

110
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:56,840
low.

111
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:57,673
So this is just our opinion on taxes 
here a visual politic and we would love 

112
00:08:00,621 --> 00:08:01,454
to know what you think.
Do you use the comments below to let us

know your opinion.

114
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,413
Do you think that more states will stop 
following the example of Texas and what 

115
00:08:08,851 --> 00:08:09,684
do you think do you think the Trump 
presidency could turn this historically 

116
00:08:11,751 --> 00:08:14,750
Republican state into a democratic one 
by 2020.

117
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,710
Do you think Texas is ever a place you 
could see yourself living as I say.
