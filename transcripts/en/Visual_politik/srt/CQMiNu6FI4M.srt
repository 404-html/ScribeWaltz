1
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:06,690
If you've been following visual politics
for a long time,

2
00:00:06,691 --> 00:00:07,524
you already know that Argentina is in 
dire straits and they need to ask for 

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,620
loans from international investors.
In these cases,

4
00:00:13,621 --> 00:00:17,450
the usual procedure is to print what we 
call a debt bonds.

5
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,340
This is a piece of paper that says,
if you give me this amount of money,

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:25,400
I'll give it back to you in say 10 years
with some interest far so good,

7
00:00:30,340 --> 00:00:34,210
but that's mentioned this situation.
Let's say that you lend three thousands,

8
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:37,750
Argentinian pesos to the Argentinian 
governments at the time.

9
00:00:37,751 --> 00:00:40,090
We're making this video,
the summer of 2018,

10
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,780
those 3000 pesos equal a hundred 
American dollars,

11
00:00:43,781 --> 00:00:45,970
but what would happen in the year 20,
28?

12
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,520
Well,
the thing is we just don't know,

13
00:00:48,521 --> 00:00:49,354
but the chances are the Argentinian 
currency will have been devalued more 

14
00:00:52,031 --> 00:00:55,840
and more by then.
Maybe 3000 pesos wouldn't even buy you a

15
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:56,810
bag of Doritos.

16
00:00:57,040 --> 00:00:57,930
Yes.

17
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,150
This is why international investors 
smart as they are,

18
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:06,760
say to Argentina,
wait a minute,

19
00:01:06,761 --> 00:01:07,660
dude.
I mean,

20
00:01:07,661 --> 00:01:08,494
I will lend you the money,
but you got to denominate that debt in 

21
00:01:10,841 --> 00:01:11,500
dollars,
man.

22
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:14,200
American dollar is not your funky 
dollars this way.

23
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,060
I give you $300 and you give me back 
$300 plus interest.

24
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:20,600
Got It.
My dear viewer,

25
00:01:20,601 --> 00:01:24,610
this is how an investor protects himself
from would be devaluations,

26
00:01:24,611 --> 00:01:28,840
but hold on a second here because we're 
not just talking about Argentina.

27
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:29,733
In fact,
most the world's countries choose the 

28
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,800
greenback as the currency in which they 
issue that notes,

29
00:01:35,801 --> 00:01:40,801
and this is why you can read headlines 
like this in every financial newspaper,

30
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,103
Mexican government will issue bonds 
denominated in US dollars to be repaid 

31
00:01:49,171 --> 00:01:50,910
in 10 years.
As you can imagine,

32
00:01:50,911 --> 00:01:53,180
we're not just talking about government 
set.

33
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:54,930
For example,
anytime Aramco,

34
00:01:54,931 --> 00:01:59,370
the Saudi Arabian Oil Company wants to 
sell their dinosaur juice to say India.

35
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,960
They'll say something like,
Whoa,

36
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,080
hold on.
What are these?

37
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:05,240
I don't even know how much these coins 
are worth.

38
00:02:05,241 --> 00:02:07,940
Do you got to pay in dollars?
My Man American dollars?

39
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,660
Because that is the currency I can 
trust.

40
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:11,553
This explains why 60 percent of all 
foreign currency reserves around the 

41
00:02:15,851 --> 00:02:20,851
world are held in dollars for one point 
six,

42
00:02:23,891 --> 00:02:26,950
$7,000,000,000,000 in circulation around
the world.

43
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,470
More than half of them are outside the 
United States.

44
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,333
There is no international law that says 
that the dollar must be used as the 

45
00:02:33,521 --> 00:02:34,354
global reference,
but most people trust the dollar as the 

46
00:02:36,791 --> 00:02:41,350
currency for international trade.
And here comes the big question.

47
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,480
What is this use for?
I mean,

48
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,463
how does America benefit from having 
their currency circulating all over the 

49
00:02:47,981 --> 00:02:48,880
place?
Well,

50
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:49,803
it kind of depends.
If you're a company or a regular 

51
00:02:51,431 --> 00:02:54,010
citizen,
this is completely irrelevant for you.

52
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:58,850
We could say it's actually worse,
but if you are the American government's

53
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,830
well having a good time.
So why having a good time?

54
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,793
I'll let me explain full of dollars.
We told you a thousand times aerovision 

55
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,143
politic.
The worst thing that can happen to a 

56
00:03:13,991 --> 00:03:14,824
currency as hyperinflation.
This means that all of a sudden prices 

57
00:03:18,011 --> 00:03:23,011
go absolutely sky high,
but how is hyperinflation created in the

58
00:03:23,861 --> 00:03:24,694
first place?
Right?

59
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:29,910
No,
the answer to this,

60
00:03:29,911 --> 00:03:30,744
in most cases,
this is a 100 percent monetary 

61
00:03:34,091 --> 00:03:36,040
phenomenon.
If central banks printing money,

62
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,790
like there's no tomorrow,
the currency devalues,

63
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,633
but why is this?
What's the connection between printing 

64
00:03:41,261 --> 00:03:44,290
money and losing the value of that 
money?

65
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:46,000
You see,
when we talk about currency,

66
00:03:46,001 --> 00:03:48,640
we have to consider it just like any 
other products.

67
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:49,241
Yep.
Yeah.

68
00:03:49,241 --> 00:03:50,074
That right.
Currencies work under the same 

69
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:54,550
principles as oil or oranges or mobile 
phones,

70
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:56,960
and that of course there's supply and 
demand.

71
00:03:56,961 --> 00:03:57,794
So for example,
a Venezuelan bolivar has very little 

72
00:04:00,191 --> 00:04:01,024
demand they need Venezuelans uses.
So when the Central Bank of Venezuela 

73
00:04:03,911 --> 00:04:04,744
print see ton of boulevard,
this expands the supply of the currency 

74
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,393
and the price falls.
This means that the currency devalues 

75
00:04:12,670 --> 00:04:14,260
nonetheless,
the demands for the American dollar.

76
00:04:14,261 --> 00:04:15,094
It doesn't stop growing.
Everybody around the globe uses it for 

77
00:04:17,981 --> 00:04:18,814
international trade.
This means that the Federal Reserve has 

78
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:25,210
a huge margin to print money before 
risking any sort of evaluation.

79
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,650
And you might be wondering,
well,

80
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:28,800
why would the Federal Reserve wants to 
print more

81
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,733
money?

82
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:37,860
All right,
so let's have a look at an example.

83
00:04:37,861 --> 00:04:38,694
Imagine you've lent $100 to the American
government and now you want them to pay 

84
00:04:42,001 --> 00:04:44,340
you back.
So you go to the American government and

85
00:04:44,341 --> 00:04:45,870
they're essentially tell you,
sure man,

86
00:04:45,871 --> 00:04:46,920
I ain't got your money.
How much is it?

87
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:48,090
$100.
No problem.

88
00:04:48,091 --> 00:04:48,924
Do you just go to that building?
The one next door is a big federal 

89
00:04:51,211 --> 00:04:52,044
reserve on the outside.
Go in there and tell them to print you 

90
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,630
100 bucks and now whip it out in just a 
second.

91
00:04:57,750 --> 00:04:58,583
No worries.
This process is called monetizing debt 

92
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,720
and when you tell things like this to 
your smart ass friend,

93
00:05:03,721 --> 00:05:05,760
the one who thinks he's an expert in Geo
politics,

94
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:08,070
he will have no idea what you're talking
about,

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,240
but the truth is that this hegemonic 
currency is what allows America to issue

96
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,050
more and more debt and do it more easily
than any other country.

97
00:05:16,051 --> 00:05:19,500
And this is why it is so normal to find 
headlines.

98
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:28,720
Gas,
the crisis is coming.

99
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:32,860
Interest payments will hit a trillion 
dollars a year.

100
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:37,660
Having such a big debt is not really 
great news for American taxpayers.

101
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,780
In this previous video we told you 
exactly why,

102
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,793
but hold on a second because I can 
probably guess what you're thinking 

103
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,560
right now.
You're probably thinking,

104
00:05:44,561 --> 00:05:45,394
well,
isn't America as irresponsible with its 

105
00:05:46,841 --> 00:05:49,960
monetary policy is Argentina or 
Venezuela?

106
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,060
And the answer to that is,
well,

107
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:52,983
the absolutely not.
You see all the central banks print new 

108
00:05:55,211 --> 00:05:58,460
bills year after year.
Not only do they print it,

109
00:05:58,461 --> 00:06:00,950
but they generate more money 
electronically as well.

110
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:04,550
The difference is just on the 
proportions on this chart,

111
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,020
you can see the increase of the monetary
supply,

112
00:06:07,070 --> 00:06:11,000
what we call the end to indicator of the
American Federal Reserve.

113
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,953
As you can see,
the number of dollars grows year after 

114
00:06:14,001 --> 00:06:14,834
year.
But what happens if we compare it with 

115
00:06:16,431 --> 00:06:19,370
say the Argentinian peso?
Well,

116
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,323
she could see the difference and what 
happens when we compare it with the 

117
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:24,350
Venezuelan boulevard.
Well,

118
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,500
I need to comment here,
and just nine years,

119
00:06:27,501 --> 00:06:31,040
Venezuela is multiplied them monetary 
supply by 100,

120
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,990
but America,
they've not even doubled.

121
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:38,130
Now for a bonus facts while making this 
chart,

122
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:38,964
we decided not to include the year 2018 
because otherwise the yellow part would 

123
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,313
just cover everything.
This year the Central Bank of Venezuela 

124
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,500
is multiplied than monetary supply by 
for thousands,

125
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,550
and this is why the American dollar is 
the most used currency on the planet and

126
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:54,384
that's because it's stable.
While other central banks print money 

127
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:57,654
like crazy,
the Federal Reserve is actually pretty 

128
00:06:59,791 --> 00:07:01,380
responsible and they might be wondering,
well,

129
00:07:01,381 --> 00:07:04,080
what about other agencies like the Swiss
franc or the British pounds?

130
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,973
I mean,
if there's one stable currency in the 

131
00:07:06,031 --> 00:07:06,511
world,
right?

132
00:07:06,511 --> 00:07:08,250
It's got to be the Swiss franc.
Yeah.

133
00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,323
Well your rights in fact,
pay attention to this part of the video 

134
00:07:11,191 --> 00:07:14,780
because this is going to surprise you 
despite the importance.

135
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:18,920
It is not the only reserve currency on 
the planet far from us.

136
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:20,130
In fact.
So check this out.

137
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:25,683
Multicurrency world.
We said it at the beginning of this 

138
00:07:27,461 --> 00:07:28,294
video.
Sixty percent of the foreign currency 

139
00:07:29,741 --> 00:07:32,740
reserves a hells in greenbacks,
but well,

140
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:33,583
what about the other 40 percent?
The second most used currency in the 

141
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:37,414
world as a reserve currency is the euro 
which represents about 20 percent of 

142
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:42,333
global foreign currency reserves for 
that follows the Japanese yen and the 

143
00:07:49,831 --> 00:07:50,664
sterling pound.
But these are not the only currencies 

144
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,813
used as reserve currencies.
Many central banks also hold Australian 

145
00:07:56,881 --> 00:07:59,550
dollars brief and Swiss francs as 
reserves.

146
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,413
But the question here is,
if what you need for a currency to have 

147
00:08:02,581 --> 00:08:06,510
a high demand is to be stable,
why don't we use Swiss francs as much as

148
00:08:06,511 --> 00:08:07,344
we use?

149
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,020
And the

150
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:14,980
answer simply is because there are way 
less Swiss francs.

151
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,843
Think about it.
Switzerland has eight point 5 million 

152
00:08:17,381 --> 00:08:18,790
inhabitants.
The United States,

153
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:19,803
they got 300 million.
This means that the Swiss National Bank 

154
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:22,963
doesn't need to issue as many bills.
The how I said that the world has one 

155
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:28,060
point six,
$7,000,000,000,000 in it,

156
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:30,790
while the Swiss franc doesn't even have 
a single tridion.

157
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,850
This means that it's harder to find 
frank's than it is to find dollars to do

158
00:08:33,851 --> 00:08:37,240
a transaction on the other hands.
America is the world's biggest market.

159
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,103
This means that thousands of companies 
from all over the world sell their 

160
00:08:40,391 --> 00:08:41,224
product set.
So imagine you're an Australian company 

161
00:08:42,821 --> 00:08:45,280
and you're selling mobile phones in New 
York.

162
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,660
How do they pay you?
Well,

163
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:49,030
of course they'd be paying you with 
American dollars.

164
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:51,460
So what do you then do with those green 
bags?

165
00:08:51,461 --> 00:08:52,294
Well,
you've changed them to your local 

166
00:08:53,081 --> 00:08:56,310
currency.
So now he will have the American cash.

167
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,173
Well,
of course that would be the Australian 

168
00:08:58,860 --> 00:09:01,050
Bank where you made the exchange.
In other words,

169
00:09:01,051 --> 00:09:01,884
the more America trades with the worlds 
of the more dollars will circulate 

170
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:09,530
around the globe.
This is a currency that is stable,

171
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:17,474
abundant,
and supported by the biggest economy 

172
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,310
decades ago.
No other currency can be a match for the

173
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,080
green back.
But as you know,

174
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:24,943
the wells is certainly changing.
And at this point you can probably see 

175
00:09:27,830 --> 00:09:28,663
where I'm going with this video.
At the beginning of this video I asked 

176
00:09:30,981 --> 00:09:33,170
you,
is it possible that the dollar will lose

177
00:09:33,171 --> 00:09:36,890
their hedge money or at least be less 
important than it is today?

178
00:09:36,891 --> 00:09:39,350
And the answer to that,
absolutely

179
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,780
us trumpets,
America first.

180
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:47,120
The rest of the world is moving on.

181
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:50,840
We've been telling you week after week 
here on visual politic that Donald trump

182
00:09:50,841 --> 00:09:53,420
wants to protect America from 
international trade.

183
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,720
His first move was to cancel the free 
trade agreements with the EU and Asia.

184
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:58,760
After this,
he introduced terrorists to steal,

185
00:09:58,761 --> 00:10:00,500
so companies like Harley Davidson,
uh,

186
00:10:00,650 --> 00:10:01,483
leaving the country,
trump has also announced that he wants 

187
00:10:03,531 --> 00:10:04,364
to end Nafta,
which is the trade agreements between 

188
00:10:06,321 --> 00:10:07,370
the US,
Canada,

189
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,960
and Mexico.
In other words,

190
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:12,470
trump's America wants to isolate itself 
from the international markets.

191
00:10:12,650 --> 00:10:14,630
So what does all this mean?
Well,

192
00:10:14,631 --> 00:10:15,464
it means that these other countries will
have less dollars and you've got to add 

193
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:19,640
other news like this ends of the met.

194
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,000
Central banks are starting to replace 
dollar reserves with the you are,

195
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:29,003
or maybe there's other

196
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:34,610
plans,
one bond sale with sanctions threat near

197
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,100
him.
It is true that the Chinese yuan used to

198
00:10:37,101 --> 00:10:40,330
be almost an unknown currency in the 
international markets.

199
00:10:40,370 --> 00:10:43,010
It was only used inside of China.
Nonetheless,

200
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:43,844
in recent years,
some central banks are starting to buy 

201
00:10:45,681 --> 00:10:46,514
it,
but of course this doesn't mean that 

202
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:52,310
banks will start changing all of their 
dollars to this currency overnight.

203
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:54,710
In fact,
there are any things we don't know about

204
00:10:54,711 --> 00:10:55,544
the Chinese currency,
things that your friends that smart ass 

205
00:10:57,741 --> 00:11:01,190
probably won't know about either,
but don't worry because in the following

206
00:11:01,191 --> 00:11:04,010
weeks we're going to be doing a

Sneak wall here.
We have some questions for you.

210
00:11:15,291 --> 00:11:18,650
Do you think the dollar can maintain its
hedge money and the following decades,

211
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,360
and if north,
what are the currency do you think?

212
00:11:20,361 --> 00:11:22,970
Should substitute as maybe the yuan,
maybe the euro,

213
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,410
perhaps bitcoin.
Well,

214
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,333
neither in the comment section below,
