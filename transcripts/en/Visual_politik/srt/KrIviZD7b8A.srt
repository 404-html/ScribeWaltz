1
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:09,413
Well,
November the 26th 2017 a hundred euros 

2
00:00:11,061 --> 00:00:14,010
held elections,
some very peculiar elections,

3
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,560
even though millions of people were 
called upon to vote that day.

4
00:00:16,620 --> 00:00:18,510
Only one vote really counts and in the 
end,

5
00:00:18,540 --> 00:00:19,373
and that was the vote of the president's
one whole Ando Hernandez who decided to 

6
00:00:22,111 --> 00:00:25,390
stay for another four years.
No nuts or what the polls said.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,700
Joe,
look at Dana.

8
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:43,060
Yeah,
this president's Hernandez very probably

9
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,410
just told himself,
well,

10
00:00:44,411 --> 00:00:46,060
hey,
I like being president a lot.

11
00:00:46,061 --> 00:00:46,930
So why leave?

12
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:49,000
Wow.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,833
Since then,
protests due to what has obviously been 

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:52,503
a rigged election and assault on 
democracy have occurred quite 

15
00:00:54,910 --> 00:00:55,743
frequently.
Honduras is a country that already 

16
00:00:56,981 --> 00:00:57,814
suffers from the tragic consequences of 
a social and political model full of 

17
00:01:00,941 --> 00:01:02,590
corruption and violence.
How model,

18
00:01:02,620 --> 00:01:03,453
dear viewer,
that is so disastrous and dysfunctional 

19
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:06,733
that it let Honduras to be the poorest 
country in Latin America and the third 

20
00:01:09,581 --> 00:01:12,370
most dangerous country in the world's,
which isn't presently at war.

21
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,103
Cool.

22
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,313
See,
Honduras is a small tropical country 

23
00:01:21,821 --> 00:01:25,810
with just over 9 million inhabitants.
The cases on a narrow strip of land that

24
00:01:25,811 --> 00:01:28,240
separates the Caribbean sea from the 
Pacific Ocean.

25
00:01:28,241 --> 00:01:29,074
Yeah.

26
00:01:29,590 --> 00:01:30,423
Okay.

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:33,230
Indeed.
Honduras is one of those places where we

28
00:01:33,231 --> 00:01:36,050
can find some of the most incredible 
beaches in the world.

29
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,640
Wow.

30
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:38,473
Sandy,
crystal clear waters and lots and lots 

31
00:01:40,371 --> 00:01:41,300
of coconut trees.

32
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:43,270
Okay.

33
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:45,500
Sounds rather nice.
It doesn't it as I,

34
00:01:45,501 --> 00:01:46,334
fortunately,
drug trafficking gangs and a political 

35
00:01:48,391 --> 00:01:49,224
and economic elites have prioritized 
above all plundering of a nation's 

36
00:01:52,231 --> 00:01:54,960
resources.
They have muddied and stains the reality

37
00:01:54,961 --> 00:01:55,794
of a country that could otherwise be 
safe and possibly even be considered a 

38
00:01:59,131 --> 00:02:00,960
true paradise here on earth.

39
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,913
Some people don't want to come here to 
claim bodies because they don't want to 

40
00:02:04,951 --> 00:02:05,784
be associated with their family member 
who ends up dead because here this gang 

41
00:02:10,501 --> 00:02:11,334
members come here to the medical 
examiners office and they case out 

42
00:02:14,311 --> 00:02:15,144
families to figure out who is next in 
that family unit that they would be 

43
00:02:18,961 --> 00:02:19,794
attacked.

44
00:02:24,620 --> 00:02:25,453
Let's,

45
00:02:25,590 --> 00:02:27,690
you might be thinking right now,
I mean a small remote,

46
00:02:27,691 --> 00:02:28,524
poor country,
just another drop in the ocean of 

47
00:02:31,201 --> 00:02:32,430
problems.
I said,

48
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:33,360
well,
wait a minute,

49
00:02:33,361 --> 00:02:36,240
because there's a lot more at work.
Yeah.

50
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:40,893
What would you think if I told you that 
we might be facing the first coup de ta 

51
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:46,840
supported by the trump administration?
Well,

52
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,920
just check this out.

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,833
Okay.

54
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,133
Fraud.

55
00:02:57,450 --> 00:02:58,850
Awesome.
On Sunday,

56
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:01,000
November the 26th 2017

57
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,833
general elections were held in Honduras 
and there were two major contenders for 

58
00:03:05,291 --> 00:03:06,124
the presidency,
which is the most important political 

59
00:03:07,721 --> 00:03:09,520
position in the country.
On the one hands,

60
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:11,590
we've got president one Alando 
Hernandez,

61
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,424
who was widely supported by the 
country's economic leadership and the 

62
00:03:15,161 --> 00:03:15,994
international community,
and he was aspiring to be reelected or 

63
00:03:19,460 --> 00:03:20,410
reelection.
By the way,

64
00:03:20,411 --> 00:03:22,450
that was very controversial because in 
principle,

65
00:03:22,451 --> 00:03:23,284
the country's constitution prevents it 
under article 239 and article that was 

66
00:03:26,711 --> 00:03:27,544
declared in applicable in 2015 by a 
surprising and very controversial 

67
00:03:30,851 --> 00:03:33,010
decision from the Supreme Court.
Now,

68
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,873
do bear in mind here that the supreme 
court is in actuality controlled by the 

69
00:03:37,421 --> 00:03:38,254
presidents,
so maybe that might have had something 

70
00:03:39,791 --> 00:03:40,624
to do with it.
It's just maybe is gay and Lasalla 

71
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,370
constitutional to show me

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:50,773
this is what article 239 set.
If a citizen has held the ownership of 

73
00:03:55,821 --> 00:03:56,654
the executive power,
he or she cannot be the president or 

74
00:03:59,031 --> 00:03:59,864
designee.
Article two 39 of the Honduran 

75
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,021
Constitution.
Now,

76
00:04:03,021 --> 00:04:04,840
on the other hand,
Salvador Nasralla,

77
00:04:04,841 --> 00:04:05,674
right?
Popular television presents that ran as 

78
00:04:07,131 --> 00:04:09,830
a candidate for the center left parties 
coalition,

79
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,630
the opposition alliance

80
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,960
slavery.
I think that is,

81
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,870
or or we didn't say yes that moment 
though,

82
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,260
Latina Scitech,
whatever.

83
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:26,320
So even you must go amigo.

84
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:32,383
Well,
the fact is that in the initial vote 

85
00:04:33,201 --> 00:04:35,180
counts,
everything pointed to Salvador.

86
00:04:35,181 --> 00:04:36,014
Nasralla is

87
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:36,883
sorry.

88
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,403
With almost 60% of the votes counted,
he had a five point lead over the 

89
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:43,304
president's.
The advantage was so overwhelming that 

90
00:04:44,541 --> 00:04:45,374
the magistrates who formed the Honduras 
Supreme Electoral Tribunal qualified 

91
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:51,980
this lead as irreversible and 
insurmountable.

92
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:54,200
However,
suddenly the counting stopped,

93
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:57,050
there was no additional information.
Can we use a system?

94
00:04:57,051 --> 00:04:59,900
Simply collapsed.
New balance appeared and in the end,

95
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,823
several days later,
the electorial tribunal awarded a 

96
00:05:03,021 --> 00:05:06,680
surprising victory to precedent one 
Orlando Hernandez,

97
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,750
one lieutenant [inaudible].

98
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:18,130
Then when it's so many irregularities 
that the organization of American States

99
00:05:18,131 --> 00:05:21,090
of self rejected the recounts and calls 
for new elections.

100
00:05:21,150 --> 00:05:21,983
It's a good video.
[inaudible] Ella oil proponent 

101
00:05:27,860 --> 00:05:31,470
[inaudible] he gets it,
but he's,

102
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,310
and the impulsivity that [inaudible]

103
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,810
but that's not all.
One day before the elections,

104
00:05:37,811 --> 00:05:38,644
the economist published on its website 
that he'd had a recording that proved 

105
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:44,890
the government was preparing to distort 
the results of this

106
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,150
[inaudible].
So the big

107
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:55,753
question now is,
well,

108
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:59,270
was the election actually,
now that is hard to say for sure,

109
00:05:59,271 --> 00:06:01,550
but let's just say that the chances are 
really,

110
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,443
really high.
All of this is without mentioning the 

111
00:06:04,191 --> 00:06:06,560
governments authoritarian behavior.
Of course,

112
00:06:06,561 --> 00:06:09,530
once the possibility of electoral fraud 
was on the table,

113
00:06:09,531 --> 00:06:12,830
the opposition mobilized and organized 
protest rallies.

114
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,693
They were peaceful at first,
but the police didn't really seem to 

115
00:06:15,351 --> 00:06:16,184
cap.
They still used as much force on the 

116
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:23,111
protesters as they want it.
For example,

117
00:06:23,331 --> 00:06:24,164
on the evening of Wednesday,
the 29th state forces fired tear gas at 

118
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:30,290
a rally of about a thousand people who 
were peacefully awaiting the results.

119
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,153
Indeed.
In this group there was even the 

120
00:06:31,881 --> 00:06:33,800
opposition leader,
Salvador Nasralla,

121
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:34,663
the police,
they didn't care that it was a peaceful 

122
00:06:35,511 --> 00:06:38,300
demonstration or that they were children
and elderly people

123
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:39,173
present.

124
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,093
No

125
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:56,443
g

126
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:02,773
even decreed a curfew,
and since then rallies have been put 

127
00:07:04,851 --> 00:07:09,830
down with 30 people being killed and is 
more than 800 people being detained.

128
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,693
In other words,
the evidence really does point to a 

129
00:07:11,841 --> 00:07:12,674
rigged election followed by forceful 
repression or simply to reinforce the 

130
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:16,973
victory.

131
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:24,840
Okay,
Nadia.

132
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:29,173
Now having said that,
we have several questions that need an 

133
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:34,100
answer and it's clearly one of them is 
who exactly is the president?

134
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,260
Who is Juan Orlando Hernandez,

135
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,053
the president,

136
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:49,520
two versions and they're really 
different interpretations.

137
00:07:49,580 --> 00:07:51,860
The first is that of a leader with a 
strong hands,

138
00:07:51,861 --> 00:07:54,950
but who can clearly rescue his country 
from becoming a failed state.

139
00:07:54,980 --> 00:07:58,970
The second is that of an authoritarian 
leader involved in corruption and crime,

140
00:07:59,010 --> 00:07:59,843
a leader who was taking control of the 
country's institutions and to managers 

141
00:08:02,511 --> 00:08:03,344
them based on his own interests.
This is something we saw in the case of 

142
00:08:05,901 --> 00:08:07,970
the Supreme Court and reelection.

143
00:08:09,770 --> 00:08:10,603
Bang.

144
00:08:22,230 --> 00:08:23,063
The president,
as we will see in more detail in a 

145
00:08:23,961 --> 00:08:24,794
moment,
has the support of the United States of 

146
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,410
America,
among others,

147
00:08:27,470 --> 00:08:28,303
and it'd be fair,
we must say that his mandate has had 

148
00:08:30,711 --> 00:08:32,990
many dark times,
but it's also had some good ones.

149
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:34,550
Let's start with these good ones.

150
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:42,390
See,

151
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:43,223
when Kwan Orlando Hernandez came to 
power in 2013 on has had the highest 

152
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:49,200
homicide rates of a country that was not
at war.

153
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:54,030
Every 13 hours a woman is murdered in 
this country,

154
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,973
the number of violent of women in 
Honduras has risen 260% it is true that 

155
00:08:59,701 --> 00:09:02,220
nowadays the country,
it's still has a serious problem.

156
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,173
It is still ranked the third west 
country when it comes to homicides in 

157
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:07,500
relation to its population.
And further,

158
00:09:07,501 --> 00:09:08,334
there's the problem,
but 90% of these crimes remain 

159
00:09:10,620 --> 00:09:13,290
unpunished,
but things while they have improved,

160
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:15,630
in fact,
this is the president's main pride,

161
00:09:15,640 --> 00:09:15,880
them

162
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:16,713
joy

163
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,693
in the United States,
the governments often jurists has 

164
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,840
created a new special police force,
which is financed,

165
00:09:22,841 --> 00:09:23,674
equipped,
and trained by the dea and FBI among 

166
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:26,734
others.
At the same time it is expelled and 

167
00:09:27,941 --> 00:09:28,774
replaced thousands of corrupt agents.
It has dismantled several drug cartels 

168
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:32,553
and extradited dozens of drug 
traffickers to the United States and 

169
00:09:35,591 --> 00:09:39,070
even created parks around the country 
which are guarded by the military police

170
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:42,460
so that children and families can enjoy 
their leisure time safely.

171
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:47,890
I look Joe Folio platform aspect.
We went by Ethan medicine.

172
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,150
So far so good,
right?

173
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,043
But unfortunately their view of the 
story does not end there with rainbows 

174
00:09:59,411 --> 00:10:00,490
and butterflies

175
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,933
is

176
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:08,520
is player evidence of the presidents 
corruption.

177
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,413
In fact,
the 2013 election campaign that brought 

178
00:10:11,341 --> 00:10:12,174
him to power was financed by money 
stolen from the Honduran Institute of 

179
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,093
Social Security and there are even well 
founded suspicions that presidents or 

180
00:10:19,011 --> 00:10:21,570
Lando cause connections with drug 
trafficking group,

181
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:23,953
illegal drug trade in Honduras,
not only infected much of its civil 

182
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:27,584
society,
including the highest levels of 

183
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:29,774
government and its financial sector,
but also brought frightening levels of 

184
00:10:32,331 --> 00:10:34,730
violence to its people.
June h Kim,

185
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:37,190
the acting United States attorney in 
Manhattan.

186
00:10:37,430 --> 00:10:38,263
In any case,
whether these accusations are true or 

187
00:10:39,801 --> 00:10:40,790
not,
repression,

188
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,230
deception,
and it's controlling,

189
00:10:42,231 --> 00:10:45,920
institutions can neither be justified.
Snore contribution to Honduras,

190
00:10:45,921 --> 00:10:49,370
being able to overcome the problems that
impede its development.

191
00:10:49,430 --> 00:10:52,700
The president has clear support from the
international community.

192
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,553
He has received money,
police aid and its military and 

193
00:10:55,770 --> 00:10:58,250
political support,
and the truth is the people,

194
00:10:58,251 --> 00:11:00,230
they expected something different.
Bus,

195
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,180
of course,
Divya,

196
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,010
all of this isn't that strange in this 
country.

197
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,620
Okay.
A cocktail

198
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,453
of corruption and violence.
Honduras is facing a difficult problem 

199
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:16,463
that is a triangle of interrelated 
powers that make being an optimist in 

200
00:11:19,741 --> 00:11:20,910
Honduras,
very,

201
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:21,773
very difficult political power.
The economic oligarchy and drug 

202
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:29,600
traffickers grabs the most 
representative case of all this.

203
00:11:30,181 --> 00:11:33,570
Is that a fabby Yo Lobo,
he's the son of Porphyria Lobo,

204
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:34,404
the former president of the republic who
was just been sentenced in the United 

205
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:38,393
States to 24 years in prison for his 
involvement and activities as a drug 

206
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:44,400
trafficker.
He actually did this when his father was

207
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,730
president of the republic and no,
we're not talking about a rebellious son

208
00:11:47,731 --> 00:11:49,440
or anything like that.
It's drug trafficking,

209
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:50,303
by the way.
It's currently the country's main 

210
00:11:52,110 --> 00:11:56,120
economic activity.
[inaudible]

211
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:59,380
we'll fed thick on it.
I hold them.

212
00:11:59,381 --> 00:12:00,214
We changed it to [inaudible] Sierras.
Another example is the New York Times 

213
00:12:03,911 --> 00:12:04,744
reported is parliaments.
It's an underequipped building from the 

214
00:12:07,091 --> 00:12:10,240
1950s that lacks the minimum necessary 
conditions,

215
00:12:10,270 --> 00:12:11,103
which contrast with the deputies parking
lost a parking lots that is full of off 

216
00:12:13,901 --> 00:12:14,734
road vehicles.
All the latest and most expensive 

217
00:12:16,901 --> 00:12:19,630
models,
and this affects practically everyone,

218
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:21,490
but if the governments and as the 
opposition,

219
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:27,100
the police and security forces entre 
moved from this,

220
00:12:27,101 --> 00:12:27,934
either extortion and bribery is common 
and it's widely known that police 

221
00:12:30,731 --> 00:12:33,250
members have ties with gangs and drug 
traffickers.

222
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:39,250
Mara Salvatrucha gangsters in Rivera 
Hernandez say they receive warnings from

223
00:12:39,251 --> 00:12:40,084
the police of impending sweeps and are 
handed captured rivals to execute for 

224
00:12:43,331 --> 00:12:47,690
anything from $440 to $2,200
ahead.

225
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:50,710
Sonia Nazario,
Pulitzer Prize winning journalist,

226
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,420
politicians,
security forces,

227
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,950
gangs,
drug traffickers,

228
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:56,440
and lastly the economic oligarchy.

229
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,790
[inaudible]

230
00:13:00,940 --> 00:13:01,773
10 families controlled practically every
economic resource and have no problems 

231
00:13:05,441 --> 00:13:06,274
paying bribes and displacing trustworthy
people in the powerful positions do 

232
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:11,250
generate something that is not a market 
model,

233
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:14,380
but a model that is entirely controlled 
by the institution.

234
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:19,170
This nice to have a highly extractive 
results network,

235
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,033
and it's ultimately responsible for 
Honduras and knots being that paradise 

236
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:24,450
that we discussed at the beginning of 
the video.

237
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,550
But we also mentioned the u s 
government,

238
00:13:26,551 --> 00:13:27,384
specifically the trump administration as
possibly being responsible for what 

239
00:13:29,941 --> 00:13:33,300
happens with Honduras is elections.
So let's get into it.

240
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:41,660
Washington's important,

241
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:44,650
yeah,

242
00:13:44,650 --> 00:13:45,483
be forgiven for thinking initially that 
Honduras is not that important to 

243
00:13:47,891 --> 00:13:48,724
Washington DC rice,
but not exactly the truth is that 

244
00:13:50,791 --> 00:13:55,180
Honduras has a certain importance to the
United States for three main reasons.

245
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,953
Firstly,
because a lot of the flights suspected 

246
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:04,030
of transporting drugs from South America
have to first stop in this country.

247
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:05,710
Exactly.
They think is two years ago,

248
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:07,390
faced with countries,
enormous crisis,

249
00:14:07,420 --> 00:14:10,150
18,000
a year in children traveled alone to the

250
00:14:10,151 --> 00:14:13,180
United States border,
and nobody in Washington really wants to

251
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:15,850
see that happen again.
And thirdly,

252
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:18,640
because Honduras has traditionally been 
an allied country,

253
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,503
in fact,
the United States has had a military 

254
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,840
base there for decades.
Due to all of this,

255
00:14:22,841 --> 00:14:23,674
the u s has spent billions of dollars in
Honduras in recent years to try and 

256
00:14:26,741 --> 00:14:29,560
reverse the country's problems.
While the trump administration,

257
00:14:29,561 --> 00:14:32,920
it knows this,
and this is why it supports Juan Orlando

258
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:33,221
Hernandez.
Indeed,

259
00:14:33,221 --> 00:14:36,070
this is what a prominent Republican 
advisor said about the matter.

260
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:37,380
Washington

261
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:38,213
has invested significant money in 
Central America to help turn the 

262
00:14:40,951 --> 00:14:44,760
security and economic situation around.
If Hernandez loses the election,

263
00:14:44,950 --> 00:14:47,430
the United States will have no effective
partners in the region.

264
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:48,323
The effectiveness of our billions would 
be at risk and more people might be to 

265
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:52,040
come to

266
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:52,873
the United States.
Danielle ruined day or Republican 

267
00:14:54,921 --> 00:14:58,640
foreign policy adviser and former 
official of the George W.

268
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,840
Bush administration.
Yes,

269
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:02,330
Washington support is clear.
In fact,

270
00:15:02,390 --> 00:15:03,223
the police,
which were trains and financed by the 

271
00:15:04,641 --> 00:15:05,474
United States,
participated in the post electoral 

272
00:15:07,311 --> 00:15:10,190
events without any complaints from the u
s embassy.

273
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:14,043
And this is because the u s government 
fears the tires that Salvador Nasralla 

274
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:17,564
his candidacy you could have with the 
Cuban regime and even the regime of 

275
00:15:20,001 --> 00:15:21,770
Maduro in Venezuela.
This is something,

276
00:15:21,771 --> 00:15:23,720
by the way,
that the candidate deniers,

277
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:27,860
they're wrong because my model is based 
in Uruguay or Chili's,

278
00:15:27,861 --> 00:15:30,320
moderate left or Costa Rica's moderate,
right?

279
00:15:30,470 --> 00:15:33,290
One thing is the friendship that my 
ideological partner,

280
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,303
Manuel's Aaliyah has with Maduro Miralis
and something very different is what I 

281
00:15:38,181 --> 00:15:41,510
think me who would be the President 
Salvador Nasralla.

282
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:42,433
Anyway,
for everyone watching this video from 

283
00:15:43,731 --> 00:15:44,564
Honduras,
we should state that things can change 

284
00:15:46,850 --> 00:15:48,170
and do tend to change.

285
00:15:48,200 --> 00:15:50,570
There's the case of Columbia as an 
example.

286
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:51,290
One,
I was the alternate.

287
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,350
Do you think that we could possibly be 
facing the first cue to tar backs by the

288
00:15:54,351 --> 00:15:55,430
trump administration?
Well,
