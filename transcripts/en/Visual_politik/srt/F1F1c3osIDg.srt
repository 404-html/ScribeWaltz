1
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:11,953
Question,
can a poor country reasonably aspire to 

2
00:00:14,641 --> 00:00:18,060
become a high income one within a few 
years?

3
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:20,940
Second question,
how much time would they really need?

4
00:00:21,030 --> 00:00:22,890
And third question,
how would they do it?

5
00:00:23,540 --> 00:00:24,373
These are some of the most common 
questions that you send us pill on this 

6
00:00:28,231 --> 00:00:30,570
channel.
We've seen in various videos how several

7
00:00:30,571 --> 00:00:32,620
countries have managed to change that 
luck.

8
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,570
It's become locomotive swells of you.
In this video I want to tell you about a

9
00:00:36,571 --> 00:00:37,404
very particular case.
I want to tell you about Poland's 

10
00:00:39,211 --> 00:00:41,760
because Poland's becoming something of a
new Germany.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,780
Well,
listen up.

12
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,800
Here's a question for you,
Andy.

13
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,900
As always,
please do not google.

14
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,920
Which do you think is the city with the 
most Polish inhabitants,

15
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:00,960
Warsaw and Krakow?
Well,

16
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:03,510
wrong.
Actually it would be Chicago.

17
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:07,020
2 million Polish people live in Chicago.
Yes.

18
00:01:07,021 --> 00:01:09,150
We own really not getting here.

19
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,200
Give you a.
it's not been easy for polls.

20
00:01:15,230 --> 00:01:18,320
During the Second World War,
Poland was the country that suffered the

21
00:01:18,321 --> 00:01:20,180
most.
No less than one.

22
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:24,110
Out of every five poles,
that's almost 6 million people,

23
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:26,330
which is the conservative estimate by 
the way,

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:28,340
lost their lives.
Then after that disaster,

25
00:01:28,341 --> 00:01:29,174
they endured 44 years of a communist 
governments who in addition to exerting 

26
00:01:32,991 --> 00:01:33,824
an enormous amount of political 
repression also left them as a poor 

27
00:01:36,531 --> 00:01:41,120
country in 1989 when the system came to 
an end,

28
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:41,973
Poland's per capita income was between 
three and five times smaller than that 

29
00:01:45,861 --> 00:01:48,020
of developed countries such as Italy,
France,

30
00:01:48,050 --> 00:01:51,110
or the United Kingdom,
but just hold on a second because things

31
00:01:51,170 --> 00:01:52,003
they've really changed.
Portland's a country located halfway 

32
00:01:58,451 --> 00:01:59,284
between Paris and Moscow and has $40 
million inhabitants completely changed 

33
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:03,663
its model and since they've done this,
a very economy has grown by over four 

34
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:08,080
percent every year.

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:08,923
Yeah.

36
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:16,650
All right,
so now you might be thinking,

37
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,513
did I just put too much emphasis on four
percent a year because it doesn't sound 

38
00:02:19,831 --> 00:02:21,290
that impressive.
This is.

39
00:02:21,310 --> 00:02:22,143
Especially if you compare it to the 
pretty crazy growth rates that you can 

40
00:02:24,661 --> 00:02:27,830
see in the Asian tigers for present kind
of sounds like a drake,

41
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,740
right?
Well folks,

42
00:02:28,741 --> 00:02:32,170
if you are thinking that you are missing
a couple of important things,

43
00:02:32,880 --> 00:02:34,410
details

44
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,423
is that we're talking about almost 25 
years of uninterrupted economic growth 

45
00:02:43,491 --> 00:02:44,324
here.
Not even the great crisis of 2008 and 

46
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:48,700
2009 really affected this country at 
all.

47
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,480
We can say the ponens moving kind of 
like a giant cargo ship.

48
00:02:52,481 --> 00:02:54,940
It's not the fastest ship on the water 
for sure,

49
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:55,774
but it has moved and incredible distance
another way young Polish people have 

50
00:03:03,091 --> 00:03:06,180
pretty much no idea what an economic 
crisis is like.

51
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,240
The second detail is also very important
to it because I'm like,

52
00:03:16,241 --> 00:03:17,074
what happens with the Asian Tigers?
Poland's has had this huge growth while 

53
00:03:20,591 --> 00:03:21,424
being a consolidated democracy and by 
the way that really kind of dispels and 

54
00:03:25,451 --> 00:03:26,284
important myth here and that's that 
countries need a strong hands in order 

55
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:32,710
to grow.
Well anyway,

56
00:03:32,711 --> 00:03:36,340
thanks to this grief,
Poland has had an amazing 25 years.

57
00:03:36,341 --> 00:03:37,174
This country has gone from having 
average salaries are between 10 to 

58
00:03:39,161 --> 00:03:43,600
15,000 American dollars per month to 
having a panic capita income taking into

59
00:03:43,601 --> 00:03:45,340
accounts each country's price 
difference.

60
00:03:45,350 --> 00:03:48,340
This in 2018 will be higher than that of
Greece,

61
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:51,340
Portugal and every Latin American 
country,

62
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,930
and the reality is it's not really that 
far behind Spain or Italy either.

63
00:03:58,350 --> 00:03:59,183
Then goes into this point,
I think there's a question that we 

64
00:04:00,241 --> 00:04:02,760
really need to answer.
How did they achieve this?

65
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:03,653
Well,
listen up because that's what we're 

66
00:04:04,771 --> 00:04:09,771
going to talk about in today's video.
The end of an era,

67
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:18,983
34 years from 1945 to 1989,
the socialist state of the People's 

68
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:24,803
Republic of Ireland,
the satellite country at the Soviet 

69
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:26,603
Union was in power by the way,
to give you an idea of how great 

70
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:31,170
Moscow's control was,
it said that when in 1950,

71
00:04:31,171 --> 00:04:32,004
the Polish leader Bolus Law Barrett show
Joseph Stalin himself a draft of the 

72
00:04:35,371 --> 00:04:38,670
future Polish constitution,
that the leader of the Soviet Union made

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,533
dozens of corrections by hands,
which of course were taken into account 

74
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,033
anyway.
The Polish regime was one of the least 

75
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:48,060
harsh in the entire Soviet orbit.

76
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:51,860
For example,
most of the lands wasn't collectivize.

77
00:04:51,861 --> 00:04:55,070
The Catholic Church was allowed to 
function with relative freedom cans.

78
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,350
Even though political repression was 
high,

79
00:04:57,410 --> 00:04:59,510
it wasn't quite as intense as it was 
another country.

80
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:05,510
Even though of course,
as in any good socialist country,

81
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:09,620
the state controlled almost everything,
and in 1989,

82
00:05:09,740 --> 00:05:12,920
it's economy completely shattered.
Now,

83
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:16,280
thanks to all these small freedoms or 
real political opposition emerge,

84
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,020
lead among others by lack of Valenzuela,
the leader of the Independent Solidarity

85
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:21,853
Union,
the thirst for union of all eastern 

86
00:05:23,451 --> 00:05:27,420
European country.
Thanks to this.

87
00:05:27,421 --> 00:05:29,670
When the Soviet Union's power began to 
crumble,

88
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,504
Poland's became the first country in 
eastern Europe to set its political 

89
00:05:33,271 --> 00:05:36,990
transition in motion to completely 
abandon communism and so on.

90
00:05:36,991 --> 00:05:37,741
June the fourth,
19,

91
00:05:37,741 --> 00:05:39,960
89,
the first relatively free elections were

92
00:05:39,961 --> 00:05:42,000
held,
and with that it was no turning back

93
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,810
shock therapy.
Just a few months

94
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:57,460
after the first elections in September 
of 19 nine,

95
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:58,313
the minister of Finance,
less egg bow Sarah of it sets a plan on 

96
00:06:00,771 --> 00:06:01,604
the table to shred the entire communist 
fabric and to replace it with a 

97
00:06:04,821 --> 00:06:06,710
capitalist model.
Three months later,

98
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:09,680
this shock therapy as it's been known as
launched,

99
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,150
exerted a liberal program called shock 
therapy.

100
00:06:13,210 --> 00:06:17,140
The idea was either the patient improves
or dies from one day to the next.

101
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:18,003
Everything was liberalized in a very 
rigid and centralized economy in which 

102
00:06:21,401 --> 00:06:24,730
prices and needs had nothing to do with 
reality.

103
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:28,610
He called it the lunar economy.
Everything was fiction or pvh.

104
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:30,850
Nia Oshinsky,
Polish diplomat.

105
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,410
Suddenly everything changed.

106
00:06:32,470 --> 00:06:33,310
Sure.

107
00:06:36,830 --> 00:06:39,170
Prices were liberalized.
Controls were lifted,

108
00:06:39,171 --> 00:06:41,480
people were able to set up private 
businesses.

109
00:06:41,540 --> 00:06:42,373
They stopped printing money.
The economy began to open up to the 

110
00:06:44,031 --> 00:06:44,864
world and the plan was launched to 
privatized public enterprises within a 

111
00:06:52,141 --> 00:06:52,974
short time,
not even the polls could recognize 

112
00:06:54,811 --> 00:06:55,760
Poland's.
Also,

113
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:58,830
the government's had a very clear idea 
about the future.

114
00:06:58,890 --> 00:06:59,723
Ponant needed to get as far away from 
Russia as possible and strengthen its 

115
00:07:02,821 --> 00:07:05,460
ties with the rest of Europe and the 
United States.

116
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:06,930
So what was the result of all of this?
Well,

117
00:07:06,931 --> 00:07:10,380
a few years later,
they joined the European Union and NATO.

118
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,273
Now,
what model do you think the country has 

119
00:07:12,451 --> 00:07:13,284
followed since

120
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:24,810
change?
Of course,

121
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:29,970
I've already told you plenty of times 
the world is getting better.

122
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:32,990
Poverty is decreasing and countries are 
getting rich yet,

123
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:33,853
but despite this belonging to the club 
of rich countries is still a difficult 

124
00:07:37,551 --> 00:07:38,630
mission.
Even so,

125
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:43,070
everything points to Poland achieving 
this within a very short amount of time.

126
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:44,043
Dev,
this country is becoming eastern 

127
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:50,720
Europe's Germany.
See,

128
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:58,820
Poland has become an industrial power 
house,

129
00:07:58,821 --> 00:08:01,310
flooded with multinationals and like in 
Germany,

130
00:08:01,311 --> 00:08:02,144
it's smaller.
Medium sized companies have begun to 

131
00:08:03,561 --> 00:08:06,050
cross the border.
The results I'll since 1999,

132
00:08:06,051 --> 00:08:06,884
it's foreign trade has multiplied by 
more than 25 Polish exports amount to 

133
00:08:10,971 --> 00:08:15,971
almost $200,000,000,000 per year,
which represents more than 40 percent of

134
00:08:16,191 --> 00:08:18,960
the country's GDP,
which is a seriously high.

135
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:35,840
Simply explains why Polish roads off 
full of trucks.

136
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:36,950
Now you must be wondering,
well,

137
00:08:36,951 --> 00:08:37,784
how are they achieving all of this?
What on earth is the key to their 

138
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,030
success?
Well,

139
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:41,903
Dave,
you are taking notes at the Polish 

140
00:08:42,951 --> 00:08:43,784
recipe has four main ingredient to the 
establishment of institutions that 

141
00:08:51,241 --> 00:08:53,590
attract a lot of foreign investments,
legal,

142
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:55,080
security,
property rights,

143
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,420
ease of setting up companies and 
competition.

144
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,283
For example,
14 special economic zones have been 

145
00:08:59,911 --> 00:09:03,630
created where any interested company can
gain many advantages.

146
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:08,490
Second,
strict controls of public accounts.

147
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,830
Homelands.
Government is one of the most healthy in

148
00:09:10,831 --> 00:09:12,360
the European Union.
Public debt,

149
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:13,223
for example,
is barely 50 percent of the GDP and 

150
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:16,323
almost as importantly since 1989,
they have been set on fighting 

151
00:09:19,051 --> 00:09:19,884
inflation,
so no printing bills to finance the 

152
00:09:21,511 --> 00:09:24,150
government.
Basically the opposite of countries like

153
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,013
Argentina,

154
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,630
first quality education,
Yep.

155
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:30,493
You heard that rise.
Poland has managed to make their 

156
00:09:31,861 --> 00:09:32,694
educational system work and they've done
this without wasting huge amounts of 

157
00:09:36,561 --> 00:09:37,394
money.
It's rate of university students is 

158
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,760
higher than the average of the European 
Union.

159
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:44,540
Nine out of 10 young people complete 
secondary education,

160
00:09:44,570 --> 00:09:45,403
and according to international studies,
the Polish education system is one of 

161
00:09:48,111 --> 00:09:50,210
the 10 best,
not just in Europe,

162
00:09:50,211 --> 00:09:55,211
but in the whole world and forth.
There's moderate taxes.

163
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,233
For example,
companies are taxed 19 percent while 

164
00:09:59,011 --> 00:09:59,844
smaller companies are taxed 15 and 
income tax breaks down into two 

165
00:10:02,971 --> 00:10:03,804
brackets,
18 percent for the first 24,032 percent 

166
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:11,780
for the rest.
And in addition,

167
00:10:15,061 --> 00:10:17,460
because Poland is a fairly conservative 
country,

168
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:21,900
families have even more advantages.
So if we take into account both personal

169
00:10:21,901 --> 00:10:24,850
taxes and pension payments,
Poland is the fourth one,

170
00:10:24,851 --> 00:10:28,650
cd country where families pay less 
direct taxes,

171
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:34,983
right?

172
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,033
So it's with these four ingredients that
Poland has managed to become eastern 

173
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:40,363
Europe's Gemini and exports and 
industrial power with a healthy 

174
00:10:42,941 --> 00:10:45,880
governments can take quality of life 
that just keeps on growing.

175
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,773
The best proof of this is perhaps that 
within a few years the great power of 

176
00:10:49,511 --> 00:10:50,344
the east has gone from being a country 
of immigrants to the country of 

177
00:10:53,321 --> 00:10:58,321
immigrants from a country of immigrants 
to a country of immigrants.

178
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:07,353
In recent years,
if something has characterized the 

179
00:11:08,771 --> 00:11:11,680
Polish economy,
it's the simple availability of work.

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,910
Unemployment is approaching six percent 
and many companies are beginning to have

181
00:11:15,911 --> 00:11:18,760
a problem finding workers.
Initially,

182
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:19,743
foreign companies would only look for 
highly experienced employees with 

183
00:11:23,111 --> 00:11:23,944
titles.
Now they take everyone and give them a 

184
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:26,673
month training if necessary.
Roman and Lake entrepreneur and of 

185
00:11:29,501 --> 00:11:32,560
course if companies need a lot of 
workers and can't find them,

186
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,483
I'll wages go up.
The average gross salary in the first 

187
00:11:35,981 --> 00:11:40,210
quarter of 2018 was seven point one 
percent higher than in the same period.

188
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,073
In 2017.
Average gross salary exceeds $1,400 per 

189
00:11:44,261 --> 00:11:46,450
month with central statistics,
office of Poland.

190
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,370
And you know what this situation has led
to,

191
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:49,031
well,
first,

192
00:11:49,031 --> 00:11:49,864
many young poles who until recently left
on master Richie European Union 

193
00:11:52,691 --> 00:11:54,880
countries deciding to stay.

194
00:11:57,620 --> 00:11:59,140
I'm second.
In recent years,

195
00:11:59,141 --> 00:12:02,020
more than 2 million Ukrainians have 
settled in Poland,

196
00:12:02,050 --> 00:12:02,883
especially young people looking for 
better opportunities than the ones they 

197
00:12:05,231 --> 00:12:06,064
could find in their country of origin.
This means the Poland now has more 

198
00:12:09,281 --> 00:12:11,170
people arriving than leaving.

199
00:12:15,930 --> 00:12:17,370
Now,
as we always say,

200
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:20,190
visual politic.
Not Everything is so great.

201
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:22,740
Portland is facing quite a serious aging
problem.

202
00:12:22,741 --> 00:12:26,760
Ends the Lore Justice Party,
a very nationalist and very conservative

203
00:12:26,761 --> 00:12:27,594
party,
won every recent election and now 

204
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:31,290
controls the country some of their 
decisions.

205
00:12:31,291 --> 00:12:32,124
Of course,
the European Union threatened Poland's 

206
00:12:33,750 --> 00:12:36,740
with sanctions and even suspends their 
rights as a member,

207
00:12:36,770 --> 00:12:39,960
but that's something we're going to 
address in a future video now.

208
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:40,794
It's your time.
Do you think ponens would be a good 

209
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:46,680
example for Cuba or with the Chinese 
model actually be better?
