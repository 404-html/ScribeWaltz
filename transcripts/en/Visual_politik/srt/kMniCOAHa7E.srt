1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,410
Argentina is an interesting case.
Busy at the end of the 19th century.

2
00:00:04,411 --> 00:00:07,230
It was the richest country on the planet
that is,

3
00:00:07,231 --> 00:00:09,450
it was Richard than the United States,
Australia,

4
00:00:09,451 --> 00:00:11,550
Canada,
and the United Kingdom.

5
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:13,890
Even when it was at the peak of the 
British empire,

6
00:00:23,290 --> 00:00:24,123
[inaudible]

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:25,713
middle of the 20th century,
the country had already gone down a few 

8
00:00:27,851 --> 00:00:28,684
positions,
but it still remains one of the 10 

9
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:33,790
richest and most prosperous countries in
the world today.

10
00:00:33,791 --> 00:00:36,400
However,
it's not even in the top 60 so how can a

11
00:00:36,401 --> 00:00:41,401
country suffer such a dramatic decline?
Well,

12
00:00:42,751 --> 00:00:45,300
it might have something to do with the 
fact that since roughly speaking,

13
00:00:45,301 --> 00:00:49,560
the 1940s Argentina has known only to 
political movements,

14
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:51,010
military and Peronas.
Yeah,

15
00:01:00,470 --> 00:01:00,800
yeah.

16
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:02,630
Previous video here on the visual 
politic,

17
00:01:02,631 --> 00:01:03,464
we talked about the origins of Coronas,
and we saw how Juan Domingo Peron came 

18
00:01:06,981 --> 00:01:07,814
to power wash.
His political approach wasn't how in 

19
00:01:09,651 --> 00:01:13,080
1955 he was overthrown by a new coo to 
tops.

20
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:14,030
So the question is,
well,

21
00:01:14,031 --> 00:01:14,864
what happens after this key?
What happened to Argentina and how did 

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:20,990
[inaudible] involve?
And perhaps most importantly,

23
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:23,930
what does it mean?
What is Peruna Islam Today?

24
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:24,920
Well,
listen,

25
00:01:24,921 --> 00:01:29,921
up in 1955 there were two cute atars 
against Quando Quango Peron's government

26
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:40,530
in the fast,
which proved unsuccessful.

27
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:44,170
The Argentine navy bombarded the Plaza 
de Mayo in an attempt to,

28
00:01:44,171 --> 00:01:45,720
to end the president's life.

29
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:49,453
Yup.

30
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,023
That

31
00:01:57,430 --> 00:02:01,120
it's just a few months later in 
September of 1955 it did not fail.

32
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:02,850
Yeah.

33
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:03,683
Got It.
You'd be [inaudible] [inaudible] 

34
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:10,000
[inaudible] [inaudible]

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:17,940
hello

36
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:21,000
to go into exile first in Venezuela,
then in Panama,

37
00:02:21,001 --> 00:02:23,040
and then it's finally and Francisco 
Franco,

38
00:02:23,041 --> 00:02:23,874
Spain.
When the new government's arrived 

39
00:02:24,961 --> 00:02:25,794
proclaiming the liberating revolution,
brandism was literally outlawed 

40
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:30,570
everything.
Absolutely.

41
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:32,910
Everything that had to do with the 
[inaudible] image,

42
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:34,800
the marches,
the symbols that Hims,

43
00:02:34,801 --> 00:02:35,634
the names,
everything was prohibited by the 

44
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,214
military government.

45
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:43,390
No.
I then feed off and even said,

46
00:02:43,391 --> 00:02:48,080
Addis [inaudible] America.
[inaudible] is your list.

47
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,453
Okay.

48
00:02:50,530 --> 00:02:51,363
In just two years,
this liberating revolution dismantled 

49
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,500
every prunus structure.
Before having new elections,

50
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,630
they even changed the constitution 
again,

51
00:02:58,631 --> 00:02:59,464
so reestablish the one from 1853 
although they did introduce 14 articles 

52
00:03:02,891 --> 00:03:06,700
which introduced almost all the social 
and interventionists measures that Peron

53
00:03:06,701 --> 00:03:07,534
had established.

54
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:10,603
Okay.

55
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:13,270
The truth is that history is hard to 
forget.

56
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,104
It's by forbidding everything that had 
to do with Peronas and in a way the 

57
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,880
military governments turns him into a 
kind of,

58
00:03:18,881 --> 00:03:19,714
yeah.
The fact is that in the following 

59
00:03:24,151 --> 00:03:26,860
democratic elections in 1958 presidents 
are,

60
00:03:26,861 --> 00:03:27,694
Toro from DC was elected a politician 
who tried to turn Argentina her rounds 

61
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,490
and reopening it to the wells,
which is precisely what made the country

62
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:37,650
one of the richest in the world.

63
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,980
Hold on a moment because despite the 
good economic results,

64
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:47,740
he had to face the peroneus unions and 
the military.

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,980
I had of course already gotten used to 
playing with Argentina,

66
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:52,660
however they wished because,
well,

67
00:03:52,661 --> 00:03:53,494
once the military boots is used,
it's very hard to suppress the 

68
00:03:56,021 --> 00:03:59,770
temptation to use it again and again.
The fact is that a few years later,

69
00:03:59,771 --> 00:04:00,604
the military demanded the resignation of
the democratic presidents from DC as 

70
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,650
well.
Why did they do this?

71
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:07,480
Well,
simply because they felt like us.

72
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:09,070
I mean,
it's pretty much reason enough.

73
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,930
Ans when the president didn't accept 
this,

74
00:04:10,931 --> 00:04:13,030
well,
what do you think the Argentine military

75
00:04:13,031 --> 00:04:13,864
did?
Well,

76
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:15,460
yes.
You probably guessed right.

77
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:18,380
They used weapons to depose and then 
imprison him.

78
00:04:18,381 --> 00:04:23,381
Yeah.
The fact is the little by little,

79
00:04:26,251 --> 00:04:30,690
the atmosphere became increasingly tense
and Peroneus themselves while mobilizing

80
00:04:30,691 --> 00:04:31,524
more and more demanding Peron's return.
There were elections and they are very 

81
00:04:34,621 --> 00:04:35,580
fragile.
Our governments.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,473
What was the result of this?
The military made another cute to Ravi 

83
00:04:38,791 --> 00:04:41,490
this time.
They gave it a rather poetic name.

84
00:04:41,491 --> 00:04:42,324
In this case they called us the origins 
Hein Revolution led by the guy your 

85
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:46,523
seeing here.
That's a general Juan Carlos 

86
00:04:48,390 --> 00:04:49,223
[inaudible].

87
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:51,683
Why?

88
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,463
And this was the beginning of very tense
period because in addition to the 

89
00:05:06,931 --> 00:05:09,090
dictatorship,
the cold war was going on.

90
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:09,983
Man's in Latin America.
That generally meant struggles between 

91
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,310
leftist guerrillas and military 
governments,

92
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:16,410
Argentina,
they were no exception.

93
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:20,810
I think we and we can

94
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:23,450
save it in the 1960s seventies and 
eighties work terrible,

95
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,150
terrible years,
are pretty much all of Latin America and

96
00:05:26,151 --> 00:05:26,984
the following year is gorilla and 
terrorist groups began to emerge 

97
00:05:28,971 --> 00:05:31,370
throughout Argentina,
such as the Monta narrows,

98
00:05:31,371 --> 00:05:34,550
he revolutionary people's army,
the people's armed forces,

99
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,473
and check this out because Peron himself
had taken his strategic turns to the 

100
00:05:38,361 --> 00:05:42,830
left and was now encouraging these types
of movements or from his home in Madrid,

101
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,010
which of course was located in Puerta to
Herro,

102
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,750
one of the most expensive areas of the 
Spanish capital.

103
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:56,270
The fact is that between the bad 
economic situation and the attacks,

104
00:05:56,271 --> 00:05:57,104
that was such huge amount of discontent 
for the military regime was forced to 

105
00:06:00,531 --> 00:06:01,364
call for elections in March of 1973 
although they of course left per on out 

106
00:06:05,151 --> 00:06:10,151
under the excuse that he didn't live in 
Argentina bugs.

107
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:17,050
That's ultimately did it matter.
And September of 1973 new elections were

108
00:06:22,481 --> 00:06:25,990
held cannes.
This time Juan Domingo Peron was elected

109
00:06:25,991 --> 00:06:26,824
presidents with check this out,
his wife Isabel Martinez dip around as 

110
00:06:30,611 --> 00:06:31,330
vice president.

111
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:32,163
Yes.

112
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,760
It was simply easier that way.
Everything stayed in the family,

113
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,740
the president and vice president,
the tandem one,

114
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,170
them an overwhelming victory with 
approximately 60% of the vote.

115
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:54,490
But hold on a moment because it wouldn't
be that easy.

116
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,353
Listen up the return.
One thing needs to be clear if that is 

117
00:07:08,561 --> 00:07:10,330
an unwritten law.
In politics,

118
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:11,164
opposition is one thing and governments 
are very different one and that law 

119
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,930
certainly applied to quantum domingo

120
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:17,883
or on

121
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:24,630
see as we mentioned before,
during his time in exile,

122
00:07:24,660 --> 00:07:28,380
he became a point of reference for every
opponent of the dictatorship.

123
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,273
But if on the left and on the rise,
but of course this friendship between 

124
00:07:31,741 --> 00:07:35,840
the extremes once the dictatorship fell 
was doomed to fall not long after,

125
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:38,340
and that the viewer is precisely what 
happens.

126
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:43,400
And in a very violent,
the situation got out of hands.

127
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:46,380
The leftist guerrilla groups continue to
attack.

128
00:07:46,381 --> 00:07:47,640
Civilians,
politicians,

129
00:07:47,641 --> 00:07:48,474
businessmen,
as well as the military per on was no 

130
00:07:50,431 --> 00:07:52,950
longer enough.
They once it's a popular revolution,

131
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,050
well at least that's what they called 
it.

132
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,080
And if we're in this government 
responded by promoting the creation.

133
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:04,973
Listen to this,
have a para military group known as the 

134
00:08:07,561 --> 00:08:11,070
triple aim anticommunist Argentinian 
association.

135
00:08:11,190 --> 00:08:13,620
The results of all of this mixed was 
tension there,

136
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,010
confrontations and disappearances,
and if that wasn't enough,

137
00:08:17,011 --> 00:08:20,250
the economy also ends from bat much 
worse.

138
00:08:23,890 --> 00:08:26,910
So problems were done.
It was becoming a bit of a nes,

139
00:08:26,911 --> 00:08:29,050
and it didn't last very long because on 
July,

140
00:08:29,051 --> 00:08:32,050
the first 1974 funds and being gay per 
on his days,

141
00:08:32,170 --> 00:08:36,010
they came to an end and he left behind a
terrible legacy.

142
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:39,860
In 1975 the war between Peronas,
it's under a proneness to government,

143
00:08:39,910 --> 00:08:40,743
was at its peak,
and it's the economic crisis led to a 

144
00:08:42,761 --> 00:08:46,090
brutal devaluation that left the peso in
tatters.

145
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,563
With this panorama,
you can probably imagine followed a new 

146
00:08:53,250 --> 00:08:56,100
queue to tar,
and it was not just by anyone.

147
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:56,993
The darkest periods in Argentine history
began on March the 24th 1976 the 

148
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:01,883
military junta government rose to power 
leds by Jorge Rafaelle of the dealer 

149
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:05,953
who's period leading Argentina was 
characterized by the permanent 

150
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:10,170
violations of individual rights.

151
00:09:13,070 --> 00:09:16,560
Cool.
We've got got,

152
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:17,533
he'd pick up when,
I mean that I've had that board about 

153
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:20,483
patio there.

154
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:24,520
The military left behind terrible 
numbers.

155
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:25,383
More than 10,000
disappeared and thousands and thousands 

156
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:28,534
more became political prisoners.
But did you have just a moment here 

157
00:09:30,371 --> 00:09:32,890
because if you think ism was dead at 
this time,

158
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:34,570
well you're very,
very wrong.

159
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:41,780
A new ride.

160
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:42,873
Yes.

161
00:09:44,150 --> 00:09:48,560
After the dark and terrible periods of 
the military junta democracy returned to

162
00:09:48,561 --> 00:09:50,390
Argentina in 1983

163
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:57,913
five

164
00:10:01,720 --> 00:10:02,553
at that time the brain is sweat 
dismantled and a new president was 

165
00:10:05,171 --> 00:10:06,004
elected,
Raul Alfonsin who the elgin dines most 

166
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,720
remember for the hyperinflation that 
occurred under his rule.

167
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:16,020
Oh trust me,
don't thank God.

168
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,560
And I said,
what do you got?

169
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,753
Inflation soared to over 80% per month,
which is pretty much what happens when 

170
00:10:35,491 --> 00:10:37,950
you just run the money printing 
machines.

171
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,100
And on top of that,
both the military again and the Peroneus

172
00:10:41,101 --> 00:10:44,040
do unions decided to make this 
government inoperable?

173
00:10:44,070 --> 00:10:48,660
The strikes were absolutely endless.
So once they were reorganized,

174
00:10:48,690 --> 00:10:49,523
you know,
what's the Peroneus returns this time 

175
00:10:51,301 --> 00:10:55,380
under the leadership of Carlos Soul men 
m and surprise,

176
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,500
the new president's off to two terrible 
first years,

177
00:11:10,501 --> 00:11:11,334
took a 180 degree turn and to knowledge 
to policies that were completely 

178
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,720
unexpected for a peroneus governments.
He brought a wave of privatizations,

179
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:19,554
liberalized the economy and trade and 
even achieved a monetary stability by 

180
00:11:23,011 --> 00:11:26,610
introducing the ones a one peso US 
dollar exchange rate.

181
00:11:32,390 --> 00:11:35,030
Martin investments began to arrive,
trade grew,

182
00:11:35,031 --> 00:11:35,864
and as the Arjun tines where again 
prospering and feeling like they could 

183
00:11:39,171 --> 00:11:42,020
rise up in the world again,
bars and my friend's president,

184
00:11:42,021 --> 00:11:42,854
Menem did not do one thing and it's 
president macri take note here because 

185
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:48,650
he did not reduce public spending on the
country.

186
00:11:48,680 --> 00:11:49,513
Public spending absolutely skyrocketed 
and so did corruption and waste of all 

187
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:59,310
varieties.
I'm awesome.

188
00:12:00,230 --> 00:12:03,020
More since things were going smoothly,
the reforms,

189
00:12:03,050 --> 00:12:03,883
they won't complete it.
Even Argentina with an overvalued 

190
00:12:06,411 --> 00:12:08,900
currency,
a huge public expenditure,

191
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:11,660
many imports and a ton of debt

192
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:20,370
and you can probably guess what happened
is in 1999 the opposition took over.

193
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:21,833
It was too late.
The crisis peaked in 2001 Argentina 

194
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,890
defaulted and the origin Argentines 
suffered.

195
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:27,773
The famous Cora Alito under this 
situation in 2003 you gas disc corona 

196
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:33,323
returned to power.
The brutus disability to wriggle out of 

197
00:12:35,581 --> 00:12:37,290
the line of falls into blame.
Others.

198
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,153
It's actually pretty admirable.
They've almost always been in 

199
00:12:40,231 --> 00:12:41,064
government,
but apparently they've never been to 

200
00:12:42,451 --> 00:12:45,360
blame for anything.
Do you know who came to power here?

201
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,253
Yes.
It would be the Coachnas proneness who 

202
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:51,240
has the same policies as always.
Only this time,

203
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,760
very much more inclined to the left.

204
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:55,473
Remember,

205
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:05,710
during the years and the Casa Rosada,
the Argentine Whitehouse,

206
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:08,570
could they restricted imports,
multiplied public spending,

207
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,490
inflation taxes and debt boss?
Give you just a moment because before we

208
00:13:13,491 --> 00:13:16,250
finish the video today,
we have one last question.

209
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,780
It's a really important,

210
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,073
what

211
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:29,860
spout on Islam,
what is Peronas it?

212
00:13:29,890 --> 00:13:30,723
How is it managed to be almost hegemonic
in Argentina despite the fact that it 

213
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:38,440
sounded terrible results?
These are the truly important questions.

214
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,221
Well,
the viewer,

215
00:13:39,221 --> 00:13:40,960
I think that taking history into 
accounts,

216
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:41,794
we can say the personas in more than a 
political party is a movements with two 

217
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:46,293
essential pillars,
excessive interventionism and public 

218
00:13:48,941 --> 00:13:49,774
spending.

219
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:51,523
Amen.

220
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:01,850
The secrets of their political success 
has to do with this.

221
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:02,743
Every time Argentina has a problem,
the Peroneus promised more and more 

222
00:14:06,111 --> 00:14:06,944
public spending all of course financed 
with the populist politicians favorite 

223
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,233
instrument,
the bill printing machine under the 

224
00:14:13,581 --> 00:14:16,310
excuse of political sovereignty,
economic independence,

225
00:14:16,311 --> 00:14:17,144
and social justice.
The three faces established by Juan 

226
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:24,080
Domingo Peron Peronas have ended up in 
making Argentina a country that is close

227
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:24,914
to the wells that has longterm monstrous
inflation and practically lives in 

228
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,330
permanent crisis.
So the question really becomes,

229
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:34,430
isn't it?
Perhaps time to find another way.

230
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:35,323
So now it's your turn from one to five.
What is your degree of confidence in 

231
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,053
Argentina is future?
You can leave your answer in the
