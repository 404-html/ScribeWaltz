1
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:09,983
We may not talk much about Indonesia,
but the truth is that this country 

2
00:00:12,571 --> 00:00:17,571
matters much more than you probably 
think $250 million,

3
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,580
half of them under the age of 30 make up
Indonesia,

4
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,370
the most populous Muslim country on the 
planet,

5
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,750
but Indonesia is also one of the most 
complicated countries in the wells.

6
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,130
It's like,
allow me to explain.

7
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:43,930
Indonesia is a huge archipelago.
The consists of more than 17,000

8
00:00:43,931 --> 00:00:46,720
islands covering more than 5,000
kilometers.

9
00:00:46,750 --> 00:00:47,583
That's 3000 miles from end to end.
This is approximately the distance from 

10
00:00:51,160 --> 00:00:56,160
London to Afghanistan.
Based on this alone,

11
00:00:57,521 --> 00:01:00,640
you can already imagine the enormous 
variety of ethnicities,

12
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:01,503
cultures,
and languages that have founded this 

13
00:01:02,771 --> 00:01:06,010
country.
Also the huge social differences.

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:06,873
For instance,
while these citizens of Jakarta are 

15
00:01:08,441 --> 00:01:09,274
almost addicted to twitter,
a fifth of the population doesn't even 

16
00:01:12,071 --> 00:01:13,570
have access to electricity.

17
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,513
It didn't issues.
Diversity is not just geographic and 

18
00:01:21,141 --> 00:01:21,974
cultural.
Different groups are essentially living 

19
00:01:23,301 --> 00:01:26,090
at different points in human history all
at the same time.

20
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,983
Traveling from Jakarta to the Maluku 
islands can seem like going back in 

21
00:01:29,811 --> 00:01:31,340
time.
Elizabeth [inaudible],

22
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,330
writer,
journalist,

23
00:01:32,331 --> 00:01:35,090
and scientists,
and you can imagine how difficult it can

24
00:01:35,091 --> 00:01:38,140
be to manage a country like this 
country,

25
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,073
which by the way,
Barack Obama spent a good part of his 

26
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,870
childhood in that right bomb.
His mother married an Indonesian citizen

27
00:01:44,871 --> 00:01:48,410
in 1965 and two years later they moved 
to Jakarta.

28
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:52,280
I feel great affection for the people 
here and obviously I have a sister who's

29
00:01:52,281 --> 00:01:53,114
half Indonesian.
My mother lived and worked here for a 

30
00:01:54,621 --> 00:01:55,454
long time and so the sights and the 
sounds and the memories and all fueled 

31
00:01:58,181 --> 00:01:59,720
very familiar.
Barack Obama.

32
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:00,591
Alright,
okay.

33
00:02:00,591 --> 00:02:02,240
Now some of you might be thinking,
but Simon,

34
00:02:02,241 --> 00:02:04,060
I mean,
why should I care about Indonesia?

35
00:02:04,061 --> 00:02:06,050
I mean,
what's so special about this country?

36
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,370
Well,
Miss Eight,

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,243
despite all of its difficulties,
the Indonesian economy has grown a lot 

38
00:02:14,691 --> 00:02:16,610
in recent decades,
and the viewer,

39
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,473
even though it may surprise us,
Indonesia will soon become the largest 

40
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,710
Muslim power on the planet and that has 
lots and lots of social,

41
00:02:24,711 --> 00:02:26,780
political and economic implications.

42
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,550
You can even notice how people have 
changed their way of dressing.

43
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,160
The average age is around 29 to 30 
years.

44
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:36,640
Those young people who have gone out 
into the market who are better trained,

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,700
create an urban middle class with a huge
dynamism,

46
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:41,980
and this dynamism is what will change 
this country.

47
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:45,430
Carlos gastone BBV,
a representative in Indonesia.

48
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:47,630
Well,
you can probably already imagined why we

49
00:02:47,631 --> 00:02:50,240
should care more about Indonesia than we
do,

50
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:52,760
but before taking a closer look at 
what's happening,

51
00:02:52,840 --> 00:02:57,840
he has a bit of history.
Independence.

52
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:10,850
Stevens in Asia has had two main 
protagonists and Suharto.

53
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:13,920
You see Indonesia is actually a fairly 
new country.

54
00:03:13,921 --> 00:03:17,670
It wasn't until 1999 that it gained its 
independence from the Netherlands.

55
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:18,583
Yes.

56
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,650
Yes.
You had that right.

57
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,200
Indonesia wasn't a British or French 
colony.

58
00:03:24,230 --> 00:03:25,063
It was a Dutch colony,
and don't think that gaining their 

59
00:03:27,081 --> 00:03:29,180
independence was easy.
Not at all.

60
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,133
Allow me to explain.
Sukarno was an important leader of the 

61
00:03:32,181 --> 00:03:35,240
resistance against colonial rule.
In 1927,

62
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,930
he founded the Indonesian Nationalist 
Party under this slogan,

63
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:40,490
one nation,
Indonesia,

64
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,850
one people.
The Indonesian one language Bahasa,

65
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:46,350
Indonesia.
Mike.

66
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,443
Yeah.

67
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:54,060
Of course.
As you can imagine,

68
00:03:54,061 --> 00:03:57,300
the Dutch authorities didn't like these 
ideas at all,

69
00:03:57,301 --> 00:03:59,790
so Sukarno was persecuted,
detained,

70
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,120
and finally forced into a kind of exile 
in Sumatra.

71
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:04,870
Hey,

72
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:05,980
imprisonment,
dear viewer,

73
00:04:05,981 --> 00:04:09,070
which saw him released in weld water.
You Buy Japanese troops.

74
00:04:09,071 --> 00:04:09,904
When they occupied Indonesia,
the Japanese themselves joins the 

75
00:04:12,311 --> 00:04:15,010
Indonesian nationalists to control the 
country

76
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,313
easily.

77
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:24,240
The fact is that two days off to Japan 
surrendered in August of 1945,

78
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,103
it's economy declined.
Indonesia's independence a declaration 

79
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:31,640
that wasn't recognized by the Dutch 
authorities indeed far from that,

80
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,483
so they tried to regain power by force 
began the Socorro's national revolution 

81
00:04:38,401 --> 00:04:39,710
that lasted for years.
Um,

82
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,553
which was very,
very bloody after the birth of the 

83
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,383
Republican Indonesia,
we experienced a painful separation 

84
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,310
process marked by terrible violence.
These are dark pages of art history,

85
00:04:50,370 --> 00:04:51,510
burt calendars,
Dutch,

86
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:54,300
former minister of foreign affairs.
To give you an idea,

87
00:04:54,301 --> 00:04:57,840
it is estimated that in just four years,
more than 100,000

88
00:04:57,841 --> 00:05:01,530
Indonesians and 5,000
soldiers lost their lives.

89
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:02,423
And that is how finally in 1949,
after much much suffering reduction 

90
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:09,380
authorities excepted underrecognized,
Indonesia's independent.

91
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:14,390
Yeah.
Dictators,

92
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,253
Indonesia,
achieving independent certainly didn't 

93
00:05:22,851 --> 00:05:24,980
mean that the country was free over the 
following.

94
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:28,190
Eighteen years.
Economy led Indonesia in an increasingly

95
00:05:28,191 --> 00:05:32,900
authoritarian way under a model that 
became known as directed democracy,

96
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:33,793
and I swear every time you put an 
adjective next to the term democracy 

97
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:40,220
usually beads that something is anything
but democratic.

98
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,920
During this time,
all kinds of problems occurred,

99
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:43,850
the country,
it was really,

100
00:05:43,851 --> 00:05:44,684
really poor.
The economy didn't work and there were 

101
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:50,180
all kinds of rebellions and conflicts as
ethnic conflict,

102
00:05:50,181 --> 00:05:51,014
self-determination,
a conflict with Malaysia and especially 

103
00:05:53,211 --> 00:05:54,044
with the Indonesian Communist Party,
first Communist Party and Asia by the 

104
00:05:56,841 --> 00:05:57,674
way,
which with China and the Soviet Union 

105
00:05:59,001 --> 00:06:02,050
supports became increasingly important 
in the car.

106
00:06:02,150 --> 00:06:02,983
True.

107
00:06:05,220 --> 00:06:06,053
See,
Staccato wasn't considered a communist 

108
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,800
leader,
but he was a rather socialist.

109
00:06:09,801 --> 00:06:10,634
Nita who didn't mind getting close to 
Mao's China and even received support 

110
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,253
from the Soviet Union.
This was something that didn't prevent 

111
00:06:17,031 --> 00:06:21,050
the Indonesian communist party from 
wanting to seize power at all costs.

112
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,323
Right

113
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,660
between all of this pushing and shoving 
in 19,

114
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,210
65 and important happens,
call me.

115
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,040
C'Mon disconnected to the Communist 
Party.

116
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,590
Prepared a who were interested in why.

117
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,150
Okay,

118
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,693
this events unleashed a brutal 
repression against the communist party 

119
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,833
that cost the lives of hundreds of 
thousands of people and which the army 

120
00:06:46,231 --> 00:06:47,064
general Suharto greatly took advantage 
of to seize power with support from the 

121
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,720
United States.
During the following three decades.

122
00:06:56,911 --> 00:06:59,730
The hotter ruled the country with an 
iron fist.

123
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,593
With Washington support,
he launched some economic expansion 

124
00:07:02,851 --> 00:07:07,050
measures that were quite successful and 
made their growth skyrockets.

125
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:09,173
However,
it was still a harsh dictatorship and 

126
00:07:11,251 --> 00:07:14,430
the state's violence,
political repression and corruption were

127
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:17,490
tremendously widespread.
So when at the end of the nineties,

128
00:07:17,491 --> 00:07:20,160
the Asian crisis occurred,
the Indonesian economy will,

129
00:07:20,161 --> 00:07:20,994
it collapsed.
The repeat lost 80 percent of its value 

130
00:07:22,861 --> 00:07:25,530
against the dollar and poverty 
multiplied by four.

131
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:31,370
Faced with this disaster general 
Suharto,

132
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:32,443
he was forced to leave after almost 50 
years of independence and dictatorship 

133
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:40,940
democracy in Indonesia,
I finally had a chance and finally,

134
00:07:40,941 --> 00:07:44,160
after a lot of conflicts because in this
country conflicts that constants,

135
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:47,180
the first free elections were held in 
2004.

136
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,011
Now,
it must be said,

137
00:07:49,011 --> 00:07:49,844
of course,
that since the hottest Indonesia has 

138
00:07:51,411 --> 00:07:54,200
experienced a period of change,
political openness,

139
00:07:54,201 --> 00:07:58,160
de-centralization as an economic policy 
that is more open to the wells,

140
00:07:58,190 --> 00:07:59,023
but even with all of this,
it is still very highly restricted band 

141
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:04,943
in 2014,
Indonesia's current President Joko 

142
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,263
Widodo popularly known as [inaudible] 
and usually qualified as the Indonesian 

143
00:08:11,181 --> 00:08:16,181
Barack Obama won the elections.
Can we promise to liberalize the country

144
00:08:19,940 --> 00:08:24,290
boost growth over seven percent per year
and lay the foundations for Indonesia to

145
00:08:24,291 --> 00:08:25,124
become an economic and political power?
Indeed the largest Muslim power in the 

146
00:08:28,881 --> 00:08:33,790
world.
That moments,

147
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:34,624
my friends expectations west 
skyrocketing the international media 

148
00:08:37,901 --> 00:08:40,870
spoke of Indonesia,
has the country of the few chat bots.

149
00:08:40,871 --> 00:08:45,871
Wait just a minute because since then 
some things changed so

150
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:47,433
enough.

151
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:52,853
Go Widodo President.
Between two worlds we know there's a 

152
00:08:58,341 --> 00:09:01,520
rival was a great revolution.
A great breath of fresh air,

153
00:09:01,521 --> 00:09:02,540
if you will,
draw a week,

154
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:03,374
was the first non military or political 
elites does in the country to take 

155
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:09,050
power.
Social networks such as facebook,

156
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:09,913
twitter,
and youtube played an absolutely key 

157
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:12,374
role and the truth is that the new 
president started off his to make 

158
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,880
Indonesia become a much more competitive
country on the right foot.

159
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,000
See arrived in power among other 
measures.

160
00:09:24,001 --> 00:09:25,410
Joker,
we greatly decrease.

161
00:09:25,411 --> 00:09:26,244
Stands,
eliminated several subsidies and 

162
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,540
allocated that money about $40,
billion dollars by the way,

163
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:33,660
to try and solve one of the country's 
greatest problems.

164
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:35,130
Then lack of infrastructure.

165
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,013
Sure,

166
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:40,233
something that makes transporting goods 
between the countries islands even more 

167
00:09:43,221 --> 00:09:47,360
expensive than importing a container 
from Europe and not only that,

168
00:09:47,361 --> 00:09:48,194
the president has also launched several 
programs to decrease bureaucracy and 

169
00:09:51,651 --> 00:09:52,484
regulations,
which is another pretty big problem in 

170
00:09:54,831 --> 00:09:59,831
Indonesia.
Let me give you an example.

171
00:10:00,561 --> 00:10:01,370
I mean,
check this out.

172
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:04,560
Indonesia's regulations and 
bureaucracies are so strong that the.

173
00:10:04,561 --> 00:10:06,270
For example,
if companies like Intertek,

174
00:10:06,290 --> 00:10:09,740
Zara or h and m wants to open a new 
store in Jakarta,

175
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,370
they can't do it directly.
They need a local franchise.

176
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,550
Yes,

177
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:18,203
it's more.
Many sectors are simply closed to 

178
00:10:19,671 --> 00:10:23,490
foreign investments and the government 
has to assume a large part of the weight

179
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,403
it.
Construction companies are a nautical 

180
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:26,353
industries,
shipyards and many communication 

181
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:31,470
companies are still all state owned 
company.

182
00:10:31,640 --> 00:10:32,473
Yes,

183
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,733
it is.
The joker is also promoting opening 

184
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:38,643
special economic tourism and industrial 
areas and just launched a medical 

185
00:10:41,831 --> 00:10:45,340
insurance model that has covered more 
than half of the population,

186
00:10:52,340 --> 00:10:55,290
so right now I imagine it's all sounding
pretty darn good too.

187
00:10:55,291 --> 00:10:59,670
You Weld if you just hold on a moment,
because despite everything,

188
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:00,533
these changes are slower than the 
president promised and slower than they 

189
00:11:03,571 --> 00:11:06,180
need to be.
Therefore,

190
00:11:06,181 --> 00:11:07,730
even though foreign investment has 
grown,

191
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,400
the growth rate is much lower than 
expected.

192
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:15,030
Of course,
this is not the biggest problem,

193
00:11:15,031 --> 00:11:17,310
nor what will probably cost this 
president,

194
00:11:17,311 --> 00:11:18,640
his reelection.
Oh No.

195
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:19,643
The big problem is that in recent years 
there have been outbreaks of religious 

196
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:28,190
fundamentalism,
moderate Islamic power.

197
00:11:35,510 --> 00:11:35,990
He is.

198
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:40,180
Indonesia has been presented as a kind 
of model like mostly Muslim country that

199
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,023
recognize this religious freedom,
a country that is becoming increasingly 

200
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:47,930
open to the world as where women 
participate actively in political life.

201
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:50,960
Indonesia tradition of moderate Islam 
frankly,

202
00:11:50,961 --> 00:11:55,190
is an inspiration to the world and we 
you and your people in your nation.

203
00:11:55,191 --> 00:11:57,220
As in mind,
religion unifies it,

204
00:11:57,221 --> 00:11:59,440
does not divide Mike Pence,
US,

205
00:11:59,441 --> 00:12:00,700
vice president.
In fact,

206
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,534
this is how the Indonesian government 
presents itself to the rest of the 

207
00:12:03,731 --> 00:12:04,564
world.
Indonesia is the world's third largest 

208
00:12:06,491 --> 00:12:07,324
democracy,
and we also have the world's largest 

209
00:12:08,801 --> 00:12:09,634
Muslim population is demonstrates that 
democracy and Islam are not 

210
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,110
incompatible.
Joko Widodo,

211
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,150
president of Indonesia.
However,

212
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,013
in recent years there has been a 
significant increase in religious 

213
00:12:19,901 --> 00:12:20,734
radicalism.
This is something that organizations 

214
00:12:22,541 --> 00:12:26,050
like Amnesty International and Human 
Rights Watch are denouncing,

215
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:29,460
and the truth is that they have every 
reason to do so.

216
00:12:31,670 --> 00:12:32,810
For example,
last year,

217
00:12:32,811 --> 00:12:33,644
the Indonesian Leymah Council,
the largest religious authority in the 

218
00:12:36,171 --> 00:12:37,004
country,
decided to defend the belief that 

219
00:12:38,421 --> 00:12:39,254
Christians and other nonbelievers 
shouldn't be able to hold political 

220
00:12:41,751 --> 00:12:44,480
positions in areas that were majority 
Muslim,

221
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,720
which does pertain to the vast majority 
of the country.

222
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:50,653
Only other hands.
The governor of Jakarta and close ally 

223
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:56,270
of President Jokowi,
a Christian of Chinese ancestry,

224
00:12:56,271 --> 00:12:57,104
known as a hawk has been condemned for 
blast from eight by insinuating that 

225
00:13:00,171 --> 00:13:02,190
politics and religion should be 
separate.

226
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:03,143
Great.

227
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:05,063
Recent years,
the Islamist parties discourse has 

228
00:13:06,741 --> 00:13:09,110
become a lot harsher.
For example,

229
00:13:09,111 --> 00:13:12,170
in 2018,
they are proposing a change to the penal

230
00:13:12,171 --> 00:13:13,004
code to prosecute relations outside of 
marriage and between same sex couples 

231
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:21,500
more harshly and even make cohabitation 
of single couples illegal.

232
00:13:24,760 --> 00:13:28,580
See Right now,
Indonesia is still a relatively moderate

233
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:29,414
country and most of its population 
supports and open democracy and even 

234
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:36,050
religious freedom,
but everything points to the probability

235
00:13:36,051 --> 00:13:36,884
that in the 2019 election,
the Islamists will have a larger chance 

236
00:13:40,431 --> 00:13:41,264
of winning and it's clear that we'll 
talking about a future power that can 

237
00:13:43,311 --> 00:13:47,390
give us many joys for many headaches.
See if the current reforms continue.

238
00:13:47,391 --> 00:13:50,210
Indonesia will be a huge market.
For example,

239
00:13:50,211 --> 00:13:53,690
it's estimated that by 2030,
the Indonesian middle class will consume

240
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:55,790
much more than Germany's middle class,

241
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:01,303
and if religious moderation winds its 
influence in the Muslim world will be 

242
00:14:04,490 --> 00:14:05,780
much,
much stronger.

243
00:14:05,810 --> 00:14:09,380
So we can only hope that Indonesia goes 
down the right path,

244
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,273
but now it's your turn.
Do you think we should support 

245
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,660
Indonesia's favoring?
Have a more moderate status?

246
