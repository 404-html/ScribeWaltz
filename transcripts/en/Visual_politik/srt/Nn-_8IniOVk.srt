1
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:09,223
In the last few decades,
Israel has become one of the most 

2
00:00:11,211 --> 00:00:14,780
important technological powers in the 
world and they're using it with a little

3
00:00:14,781 --> 00:00:19,190
more than 8 million inhabitants.
This country has more than 4,000

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:20,540
tech companies,
Cisco,

5
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:21,351
paypal,
Google,

6
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:22,184
facebook,
apple and Intel are only some of the 

7
00:00:23,871 --> 00:00:26,390
many companies that develop new products
in Israel.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,513
How did such a small island study island
country become one of the world's 

9
00:00:29,931 --> 00:00:31,790
innovation leaders?
Well,

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:33,600
we're going to answer that question.
In today's

11
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:35,070
video

12
00:00:39,540 --> 00:00:42,690
is one of the most controversial 
countries in the world ends in truth.

13
00:00:42,691 --> 00:00:43,524
It's pretty difficult to talk about it 
without having to revert a was religion 

14
00:00:46,381 --> 00:00:48,460
and various political conflicts.
However,

15
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:49,463
in this video we're going to try it and 
we're going to try and shed some lights 

16
00:00:51,201 --> 00:00:53,250
on a very different side of this country
because they.

17
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:54,840
You are.
In the last few decades,

18
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:58,200
Israel has become one of the world's 
greatest technological powers,

19
00:00:58,201 --> 00:01:01,230
and this is something pretty surprising.
As we mentioned,

20
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,093
Israel has over 4,000
tech based companies and ace of the 

21
00:01:04,891 --> 00:01:05,724
largest 500 companies in the wells have 
subsidiaries here oriented towards 

22
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,250
research and innovation.
In fact,

23
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,113
Tel Aviv right off to silicon valley is 
the most important technological center 

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:18,750
in the world may seem impossible given 
its size.

25
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:19,643
Israel is the country in the world with 
the third most companies listed on the 

26
00:01:22,411 --> 00:01:25,050
Nasdaq.
This is only behind is the United States

27
00:01:25,051 --> 00:01:25,884
and China.

28
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:31,240
Israel.

29
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,520
More companies are listed on this market
than Spain,

30
00:01:33,521 --> 00:01:34,270
Italy,
France,

31
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,910
Germany,
and the Netherlands all put together.

32
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:40,090
So how about some specific examples?
Well,

33
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:40,840
here,
they all,

34
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:41,673
at the time of this video going out,
most of the next iphone is hardware is 

35
00:01:44,141 --> 00:01:45,730
being developed in Israel.
Further,

36
00:01:45,731 --> 00:01:48,010
many of Google's innovations are made in
Israel.

37
00:01:48,011 --> 00:01:48,844
Bands Intel,
the world's leader in microchips who's 

38
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,920
most of its success to the innovations 
of it's Israeli subsidiary,

39
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:54,813
which by the way has 11,000
workers and is one of the largest 

40
00:01:57,701 --> 00:01:58,534
companies in the entire country and 
leaving Microsoft has been considered a 

41
00:02:02,471 --> 00:02:03,380
semi Israeli radiation.

42
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:06,660
Funny.
It is a hub of innovation with top notch

43
00:02:06,661 --> 00:02:07,494
computer science,
academic institutes and revolutionary 

44
00:02:09,841 --> 00:02:10,740
technologies.

45
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,521
Hey Belt,
IBM,

46
00:02:12,521 --> 00:02:13,354
Cisco,
Amazon,

47
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,193
facebook.
These are the companies that we use 

48
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,560
everyday who's technology relies a lot 
on r and d that is done in Israel.

49
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,453
This actually makes up more than 12 
percent of its national GDP and half of 

50
00:02:25,451 --> 00:02:26,670
its exports.
Alright,

51
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:30,700
so now you might be wondering how did 
they achieved such success?

52
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:31,623
Now,
cultural factors are usually considered 

53
00:02:32,951 --> 00:02:33,784
here,
but today we want to focus on three 

54
00:02:35,081 --> 00:02:38,350
political keys that were essential in 
this process.

55
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:41,833
Use My,

56
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,170
the 19 eighties in Israel are remembered
as a terrible decade,

57
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:48,030
especially from the economic 
perspective.

58
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,760
Back then the country was going through 
a tough crisis.

59
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:55,790
Inflation between 1980 and 1985 exceeded
100 percent every year.

60
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,783
Deficits and public debts were an almost
unbearable financial burden on the 

61
00:02:59,801 --> 00:03:00,634
economy in general.
People felt handcuffed due to excessive 

62
00:03:02,981 --> 00:03:04,750
state intervention.
To a large extent,

63
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:08,200
Israel was very dependent on the help 
coming from different parts of the wells

64
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:12,280
and even though the situation started to
stabilize by the end of the eighties,

65
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:13,173
right at that time,
there was a massive arrival of Jewish 

66
00:03:15,221 --> 00:03:18,550
people from different parts of the 
Soviet Union in very little time.

67
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:19,443
800,000
new people arrived in the country that 

68
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,473
now don't forget to put some perspective
on this number in relative terms that 

69
00:03:25,061 --> 00:03:25,894
would be like 70 million immigrants 
arriving in the United States and now 

70
00:03:29,531 --> 00:03:31,660
the question for Israel was fairly 
clear,

71
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,800
how could they generate jobs for so many
people in such a depressed economy?

72
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:38,560
Israel's only option was to reinvent 
itself.

73
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:44,363
The government tried to encourage the 
new canvas to create companies with 

74
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:48,690
subsidies that would promote the work of
on trapping nurse,

75
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:49,553
but they seen realize that this method 
didn't results in very prosperous 

76
00:03:52,591 --> 00:03:53,424
companies.
Immigrants who had no experience in 

77
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:55,734
management and they lacked commercial 
knowledge and they rarely got any 

78
00:03:58,171 --> 00:03:59,220
financing.
I mean,

79
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,080
after all,
he would want to invest their money in a

80
00:04:01,090 --> 00:04:04,260
turbulent country like Israel.
And this is when the government realized

81
00:04:04,261 --> 00:04:07,930
that the key was to pass on attracting 
international venture capital that isn't

82
00:04:07,931 --> 00:04:10,620
money used for new ideas and new 
companies.

83
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,470
In order to do so,
they came up with the Osmo program,

84
00:04:13,471 --> 00:04:14,304
thanks to yours map.
The government created 10 funds of 

85
00:04:16,041 --> 00:04:16,874
venture capital and allocated $100,
million dollars to be used under these 

86
00:04:20,341 --> 00:04:21,174
conditions.
Each Fund's capable of levying 12 

87
00:04:23,430 --> 00:04:27,330
million private investors would receive 
8 million in public investments.

88
00:04:27,390 --> 00:04:30,120
In exchange the government would keep 40
percent of the property,

89
00:04:30,121 --> 00:04:32,250
but in case the investment was 
successful,

90
00:04:32,251 --> 00:04:33,084
the inventus could get these shares from
the government just by giving the 

91
00:04:35,251 --> 00:04:37,740
government's money back with the small 
interest rate,

92
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,633
so in 10 years,
all the funds that came to Israel at 

93
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:41,664
that time,
lazy about 15 million billion dollar 

94
00:04:45,330 --> 00:04:47,700
which will invested into local 
companies.

95
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:48,593
So if things worked well,
the profits would be mainly for the 

96
00:04:50,941 --> 00:04:53,320
investors and if things didn't work so 
well,

97
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:54,840
the government,
which Sharon the losses.

98
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:56,520
Now,
this might seem unfair,

99
00:04:56,521 --> 00:04:59,700
but the truth is that the public 
investment was relatively small lands.

100
00:04:59,701 --> 00:05:03,270
Also the government expected to get the 
losses back from the new taxes generated

101
00:05:03,271 --> 00:05:06,180
by these new companies and all of the 
jobs that they would create.

102
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,920
The idea was to fire things up and then 
continue to reap the ongoing benefits.

103
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:11,783
Since then,
most public programs in Israel have 

104
00:05:13,681 --> 00:05:17,070
followed this same system and the truth 
is the results.

105
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:20,370
They couldn't have been any better.
International money started to arrive.

106
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,270
There was funding for almost any idea,
and in the first eight years alone,

107
00:05:24,271 --> 00:05:29,271
the number of funds rose from 20 to 513.
As a result,

108
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:30,203
Israel today has one of the best 
ecosystems fall entrepreneurial capital 

109
00:05:32,821 --> 00:05:34,640
in the world and according to the last 
one,

110
00:05:34,641 --> 00:05:35,474
cd data and the investment available for
new companies exceeds $150 per person 

111
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:42,720
per year.
To make a comparison of that figure.

112
00:05:42,721 --> 00:05:45,350
In Spain,
it's only about three point $5,

113
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,223
which is a solid 40 times less.
The key in this process is that venture 

114
00:05:49,801 --> 00:05:50,634
capital doesn't just bring money with 
this money also comes expertise and 

115
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,133
contacts

116
00:05:58,310 --> 00:05:59,143
immigration

117
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,970
that Israel is the country which has bet
on immigration.

118
00:06:03,971 --> 00:06:07,300
The next one out of every three citizens
has been born abroad.

119
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:08,163
Hands nine out of 10 are either 
immigrants or the children or the 

120
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:11,134
grandchildren of immigrants.
This is an impressive migratory number 

121
00:06:13,481 --> 00:06:16,420
that explains the growth of its 
population from 800,000

122
00:06:16,421 --> 00:06:19,900
inhabitants in 1948,
more than 8 million today.

123
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:21,033
In this latest round of immigration,
nearly 50 French Jews arrived at Tel 

124
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:28,660
Aviv's Ben Gurion airport,
so in little more than 60 years,

125
00:06:28,661 --> 00:06:29,494
the population has multiplied by 10.
Israel is in fact say political and 

126
00:06:33,131 --> 00:06:35,770
historical exception because their 
founding documents,

127
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:36,604
so to speak,
it's constitution expresses the need to 

128
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:42,040
have an open integration policy.
Let's examine the law of return,

129
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:44,950
which is still enforced today and was 
created in 1950.

130
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:49,780
Three Jew has the right to come to this 
country as an older law of return.

131
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:51,940
Article One,
and I don't get this wrong,

132
00:06:51,941 --> 00:06:52,774
this is not a minor issue.
Immigration has contributed to the 

133
00:06:55,061 --> 00:06:58,470
economic miracle as much as any other 
facts that no,

134
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:02,440
no matter what populous politicians say,
whose aim is often just to get votes.

135
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:03,343
The wealthiest nations on usually the 
ones with more immigrants among other 

136
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:07,474
reasons,
it's usually because immigrants have 

137
00:07:08,321 --> 00:07:09,154
higher rates of entrepreneurship and 
also because immigrants helped boost 

138
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:12,663
international trade,
especially with their countries of 

139
00:07:14,501 --> 00:07:15,430
origin.
By the way,

140
00:07:15,431 --> 00:07:17,140
if you are interested about the 
immigration,

141
00:07:17,141 --> 00:07:17,974
I'm going to link over to some videos 
about that that we've put together at 

142
00:07:20,291 --> 00:07:21,340
the end of this video.

143
00:07:24,630 --> 00:07:29,120
Education quality

144
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:32,900
of Israeli education is almost a 
national hallmark in 1918,

145
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,420
30 years before the founding of the 
state of Israel,

146
00:07:35,421 --> 00:07:38,840
Jewish specialist founded the Hebrew 
University of Jerusalem,

147
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,733
Israel today as one of the highest rates
of people with college degrees and the 

148
00:07:42,621 --> 00:07:43,454
country.
It has a lot of success with fusion 

149
00:07:45,231 --> 00:07:46,064
companies slash universities.
Finance for Israeli universities relies 

150
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:51,320
mainly on projects financed by private 
companies,

151
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:54,910
so there are reasons for universities to
collaborate with them further,

152
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,870
they have achieved the best rate of 
business creation.

153
00:07:56,871 --> 00:08:00,080
In the Oec d,
knowledge transfer is a central.

154
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:04,040
This is taking the university and 
professional world closer together.

155
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:05,990
God,
everything went well,

156
00:08:05,991 --> 00:08:08,450
so so far we've seen the main keys to 
success,

157
00:08:08,451 --> 00:08:11,360
but that all other influential factors,
for example,

158
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:14,840
there is the Jewish Chutzpah,
a tendency to question everything.

159
00:08:14,860 --> 00:08:15,693
Something that is key in Jewish culture.
The military service is also a 

160
00:08:18,411 --> 00:08:21,410
surprising and important thing is it 
helps social mobilization.

161
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:24,410
Forcing young people from different 
social classes to interact,

162
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,101
hey,
well,

163
00:08:25,101 --> 00:08:28,070
compulsory military service isn't 
exactly great.

164
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:31,070
It does have some positive effects in 
this case.

165
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:32,510
Now we could also discuss,
for example,

166
00:08:32,511 --> 00:08:34,550
and that's y'all yahoo's reforms of 
2003,

167
00:08:34,551 --> 00:08:36,380
which were essential to Israel's 
success,

168
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:38,620
but I think it's better to leave that 
for a future video,

169
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:39,483
but the thing is,
thanks to all of what we've discussed 

170
00:08:40,731 --> 00:08:43,940
today since the 19 eighties,
Israel has doubled its population.

171
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:44,803
Multiply the number of jobs by four and 
grown by an annual average rate of four 

172
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,281
percent.
Today.

173
00:08:49,281 --> 00:08:52,850
It's GDP per capita is higher than other
countries like Spain or Italy.

174
00:08:52,910 --> 00:08:53,743
So what do you think will Israel 
consolidate itself as the leading 

175
00:08:55,831 --> 00:08:56,664
technological power in the world?
Could its model will be repeated for 

176
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,463
other countries?
