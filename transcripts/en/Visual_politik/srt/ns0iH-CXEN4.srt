1
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:07,973
I'm going to start today off with a 
question because I want to know when is 

2
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:14,370
the last time you bought a music cd like
this one.

3
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,570
In fact,
this.

4
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:16,463
This is naturally a music cd.
This is a CD that my Internet provider 

5
00:00:19,631 --> 00:00:24,631
sent me to set up my router seriously 
for the millennials watching this video,

6
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:27,780
compact disc was a thing that had songs 
on it.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,190
Yup.
Before the Internet era,

8
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:32,670
if you wanted to listen to music,
you actually have to buy it.

9
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:33,540
There was this thing,
good,

10
00:00:33,541 --> 00:00:34,374
a record shop and there was a cd or a 
cassette tape and these things can cost 

11
00:00:37,651 --> 00:00:42,651
up to $30.
I know,

12
00:00:44,891 --> 00:00:45,724
I know.
It all seems pretty bizarre these days 

13
00:00:47,021 --> 00:00:51,040
going to a physical store to purchase 
music in less than 20 years,

14
00:00:51,041 --> 00:00:53,830
record sales have almost disappeared in 
the year.

15
00:00:53,831 --> 00:00:54,664
2,000.
More than 900 million cds were sold in 

16
00:00:57,581 --> 00:01:00,040
America alone.
Eighteen years later,

17
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:00,874
this number has dropped to 90 million.
That's less than a 10th of what it used 

18
00:01:04,661 --> 00:01:05,494
to be.
The reason of course is internet 

19
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,160
downloads.
Platforms like napster,

20
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,100
email and torrance have completely 
changed the industry,

21
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:14,410
and of course you might think in this 
situation,

22
00:01:14,411 --> 00:01:16,930
record labels must be going totally 
bankrupt,

23
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:18,160
right?
Well,

24
00:01:18,220 --> 00:01:20,200
I mean actually the opposite is true.

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:25,023
University

26
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:26,423
music group turned over an average of 17
point $5,000,000 per day in 2017 as the 

27
00:01:32,661 --> 00:01:36,980
company's annual sales hit record highs 
topping $6,000,000,000,

28
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,160
and this is just one example.
Other music companies like Sony,

29
00:01:40,161 --> 00:01:42,590
music or Warner are in a similar 
situation,

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:46,370
absolutely record profits sands in case 
you were wondering,

31
00:01:46,371 --> 00:01:49,850
the answer is no.
Streaming platforms like Pandora,

32
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,713
Deezer,
and of course spotify are not enough to 

33
00:01:52,731 --> 00:01:54,410
explain this phenomenon.
For example,

34
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,430
Taylor swift is one of the world's most 
famous artists.

35
00:01:57,431 --> 00:02:01,640
Injury now hardly even makes $400,000 a 
year from spotify listens.

36
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:03,200
Now,
this might seem like a lot,

37
00:02:03,201 --> 00:02:06,770
but believe me,
it is absolute pennies compared with the

38
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:10,010
mega money that Michael Jackson made 
from the sales of thriller.

39
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,070
So why are record labels making so much 
money?

40
00:02:13,130 --> 00:02:13,963
How could they even survive all the 
illegal internet downloads and file 

41
00:02:16,761 --> 00:02:19,190
sharing platforms like napster and 
email?

42
00:02:19,250 --> 00:02:20,083
Well,
today we're going to answer these 

43
00:02:20,721 --> 00:02:21,950
questions,
but before we do,

44
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:27,430
let's take a look back at the history,
creative destruction in the.

45
00:02:28,871 --> 00:02:29,704
In 1935,
the Union of American musicians 

46
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:36,671
published this statement are multiplied 
and duplicated by the thousands and then

47
00:02:38,641 --> 00:02:42,480
sold to and used in places where 
otherwise musicians would be employed.

48
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,433
According to this union,
more than 8,000 professional musicians 

49
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,020
that lost their jobs because of the 
so-called jukeboxes.

50
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:51,850
A box for those who don't know is a big 
record plant,

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,460
sits in a bar or restaurant so you can 
insert a coin and choose a song that you

52
00:02:56,461 --> 00:02:57,294
want

53
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:01,520
by the end.
Nineteen 35,

54
00:03:01,521 --> 00:03:06,500
more than 135,000 machines like this one
was sold throughout the United States,

55
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,363
but at the same time that those 8,000 
traditional musicians were taken out of 

56
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:10,874
business,
Benny Goodman was signing a million 

57
00:03:12,830 --> 00:03:15,490
dollar contract with a label called RCA 
victor.

58
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:24,050
The business model of the music industry
had already changed forever.

59
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,913
Prior to this,
musicians lived off the money they made 

60
00:03:26,271 --> 00:03:27,440
from concerts.
In fact,

61
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:31,430
the first music records swept used as 
advertising for the life performances,

62
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:35,420
but now 90 percent of their income was 
coming from record sales.

63
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:39,120
This is a process which we call creative
destruction,

64
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,963
but this was more of an economic shift.
The way we listened to music changed 

65
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,400
forever as well.
All of a sudden,

66
00:03:51,401 --> 00:03:54,400
some local music genre started being 
enjoyed nationwide,

67
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:57,670
for example,
of jazz music was a typical genre in New

68
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,503
Orleans,
but it ended up expanding all over 

69
00:03:59,501 --> 00:04:00,334
America and not only that,
this also changed the way that we 

70
00:04:03,071 --> 00:04:03,904
understood music.
Think about it before we could record 

71
00:04:05,531 --> 00:04:06,364
music,
musicians could only do live 

72
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:08,373
performances.
That maximum audience was just a few 

73
00:04:10,691 --> 00:04:14,110
hundred people.
Suddenly radios and records allowed them

74
00:04:14,111 --> 00:04:14,944
to reach millions and this way it made a
whole lot more money is how a new genre 

75
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:27,970
was created,
a musical style made for radio,

76
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,870
and that's of course rock and roll.
This is a style of music that originated

77
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:32,704
in America and ended up expanding to all
parts of the West from Los Angeles to 

78
00:04:37,061 --> 00:04:42,061
Berlin rock stars.
We're no longer just simple artists.

79
00:04:44,371 --> 00:04:47,190
They were engines inside of a complex 
machine,

80
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:49,800
the record label,
paying for marketing campaigns,

81
00:04:49,801 --> 00:04:50,634
organized massive concerts,
and even negotiated advertising deals 

82
00:04:53,131 --> 00:04:56,990
for them and meanwhile the Rockstar gave
the whole industry a young,

83
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:57,863
fresh face

84
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,440
is why wild about is like Elvis and the 
Beatles became millionaires.

85
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:10,360
The big companies.
It just got bigger and bigger.

86
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:11,253
Since then,
music was not just listened to all 

87
00:05:12,641 --> 00:05:16,030
across the developed world.
A record like Michael Jackson's thriller

88
00:05:16,031 --> 00:05:16,864
could sell more than 66 million copies 
in a brand new market that stretched 

89
00:05:20,501 --> 00:05:24,310
from La to Tokyo.
By the in 1999 in the music industry had

90
00:05:24,311 --> 00:05:25,480
reached its ceiling.
Well,

91
00:05:25,481 --> 00:05:28,660
there's $1,200 million records had been 
sold.

92
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,190
The business was bigger than the GDP of 
a country like the Dominican Republic.

93
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:36,190
And what happens when an industry 
generates so much money?

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:37,233
Well,
the big guys start eating the smaller 

95
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:44,830
for a better understanding.
In that moment,

96
00:05:44,831 --> 00:05:45,664
78 percent of the industry was 
concentrated in just five big 

97
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,460
multinationals.
And then when the music industry was the

98
00:05:51,461 --> 00:05:55,320
ultimate moneymaking machine,
something rather surprising habits.

99
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,060
Remember that thing I said about 
creative destruction?

100
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:05,043
Well,
if there's one good example of positive 

101
00:06:06,251 --> 00:06:07,990
distraction,
it's napster.

102
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:09,003
Napster was the first software that 
allowed users to download songs in MP 

103
00:06:12,281 --> 00:06:13,114
three format in a fast free and of 
course illegal way from one day to the 

104
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:18,064
next.
Those records that could cost $30 could 

105
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:24,220
be found for free online,
and as you can see on this chart,

106
00:06:24,550 --> 00:06:26,500
this was the beginning of the end.

107
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,350
Even though napster lost a case in the 
courts,

108
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,203
it was already too late.
The music business had already changed 

109
00:06:36,421 --> 00:06:37,740
forever.
At the end of the day,

110
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:40,360
why would you buy something if you can 
get it for

111
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,273
great,

112
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,560
but just hold on a minute here because I
haven't looked at the chart again,

113
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,453
if you pay attention,
you'll see that despite a dramatic 

114
00:06:50,801 --> 00:06:53,920
decline in record sales,
the profit for company is like universal

115
00:06:53,921 --> 00:06:56,440
music group hasn't actually changed that
much.

116
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:57,610
Why?
Well,

117
00:06:57,611 --> 00:07:02,611
let's explain that right now.
Size matters drillers.

118
00:07:05,441 --> 00:07:07,990
8,000 musicians that lost their jobs in 
1935.

119
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,430
Well,
in the year 2000,

120
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,620
something similar happened.
Universal music,

121
00:07:11,621 --> 00:07:14,800
fod,
4,000 people practically overnight.

122
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:18,370
This was 34 percent of their staff at 
this point,

123
00:07:18,371 --> 00:07:22,210
record sales were almost 90 percent of 
their income and those sales,

124
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,900
they were falling by 20 percent.
Yeah,

125
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,213
often.
Yeah,

126
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,220
and this moment is when the executives 
of the big record labels started singing

127
00:07:33,221 --> 00:07:34,054
the same old tune that we've been 
talking about over and over again in 

128
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:37,174
this video,
and of course creative destruction if 

129
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:48,880
they wanted to survive that to make a 
180 degree shift to the company,

130
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,870
they had to stop being a record label 
and start becoming a music label.

131
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:53,621
Oh,
okay.

132
00:07:53,621 --> 00:07:55,540
But you know,
what does that actually mean?

133
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:56,433
Well,
let's have a look at the example of 

134
00:07:57,701 --> 00:07:58,534
universal music reading.
The first step for creative destruction 

135
00:08:00,911 --> 00:08:02,650
is of course destruction.

136
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,470
In the past decade of the 21st century,
universal got rid of everything that was

137
00:08:10,471 --> 00:08:12,450
not making it any money.
What was that?

138
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:14,310
Well,
that would be the record.

139
00:08:14,311 --> 00:08:15,144
Manufacturing factories,
they sold as many of those things as 

140
00:08:17,731 --> 00:08:18,564
possible.
And what's next up in creative 

141
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:20,910
destruction?
Well,

142
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,833
of course,
that's creativity with all the money 

143
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,113
they got from selling the factories.
Universal bought all the music labels 

144
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:30,400
they possibly could.
The main goal was to expand them,

145
00:08:30,401 --> 00:08:34,950
use a catalog as much as possible,
which explains news like this,

146
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:39,393
universal music group purchases,
Emi music label group will acquire 

147
00:08:42,911 --> 00:08:44,950
catalogs of the Beatles.
Pink Floyd,

148
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:49,120
radiohead and more so what happens after
some creative destruction like this?

149
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:51,550
Well tastes to musical genres.
They changed.

150
00:08:51,580 --> 00:08:54,610
For example,
we have k pop with songs like gangnam

151
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,443
style

152
00:08:59,290 --> 00:09:02,680
genre in South Korea.
That's ended up expanding to the rest of

153
00:09:02,681 --> 00:09:03,670
the wells.
Yep.

154
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:04,673
Of Us in the 19 thirties,
the music industry was limited to the 

155
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:10,810
United States then in the eighties and 
it expanded throughout the West.

156
00:09:10,811 --> 00:09:11,644
Now in the two thousands,
music is a 100 percent global industry 

157
00:09:15,490 --> 00:09:19,960
and companies like universal have bought
labels in every market.

158
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:21,083
You could have

159
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:23,720
university.

160
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:24,690
Oh,
music science.

161
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:29,710
Ten cent deal for China expands music 
group to relaunch emi records in.

162
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:34,013
Yeah.

163
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,163
Bursal buys majority stake in Kenyan 
label ai records and now you might 

164
00:09:41,611 --> 00:09:42,480
wonder,
okay,

165
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,700
but no matter how many labels you have 
by,

166
00:09:44,701 --> 00:09:45,534
if people don't buy music anymore,
you're income's going to fold 

167
00:09:47,671 --> 00:09:48,960
inevitably.
Alright.

168
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:50,060
Well,
yeah.

169
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:51,060
Yeah.
You are right.

170
00:09:51,061 --> 00:09:51,894
In fact,
the music industry today is nothing but 

171
00:09:53,310 --> 00:09:57,870
a shadow of what it used to be so well.
What's the difference?

172
00:09:57,990 --> 00:09:58,771
Well,
now,

173
00:09:58,771 --> 00:10:01,130
despite the cake being smaller,
oh,

174
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:06,140
way less people using,
as you can see on the chart,

175
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:11,450
72 percent of the industry is covered by
three big multinationals,

176
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,860
universal,
Sony,

177
00:10:12,861 --> 00:10:13,694
music and Warner,
and yes now is when we start talking 

178
00:10:17,810 --> 00:10:19,880
about spotify,
as we said before,

179
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,580
spotify gives various or money to the 
artists.

180
00:10:22,581 --> 00:10:25,610
1 million listens only means about 
$7,000,

181
00:10:25,730 --> 00:10:26,563
but when you have the rights of 25 
percent of the music produced in the 

182
00:10:29,151 --> 00:10:31,250
world,
even if you make one point zero,

183
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:35,360
$0 per listen,
you're still become a million app today.

184
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:36,194
Record sales,
they've gone from being 90 percent of 

185
00:10:38,481 --> 00:10:41,090
the industry's profits to just $25

186
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,713
and streaming music represents six out 
of every $10 entering the music 

187
00:10:51,141 --> 00:10:52,160
industry.
Of course,

188
00:10:52,161 --> 00:10:52,994
this is great news for multinational 
corporations which make more and more 

189
00:10:55,911 --> 00:10:56,744
money that as you can imagine,
this is not so good news for the 

190
00:10:59,211 --> 00:11:00,044
musicians.
It's harder and harder to make money 

191
00:11:01,821 --> 00:11:02,654
with music and this is why you need to 
be extremely popular to make any money 

192
00:11:05,841 --> 00:11:07,100
out of this.
On the other hand,

193
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:07,934
those three big labels aren't willing to
risk what they have by experimenting 

194
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,133
with new formulas,
but always a minute because this is not 

195
00:11:14,661 --> 00:11:15,494
so bad.
If you've been following the news and 

196
00:11:16,511 --> 00:11:17,344
the music industry lately,
you'll probably see that there's a bit 

197
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,660
more room for some creative destruction.

198
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:33,070
Now let's artists bypass labels and 
upload their own music.

199
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
Yes,
do you is if you have a bands,

200
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:35,634
you can now upload your songs directly 
to spotify and get your royalties 

201
00:11:38,770 --> 00:11:41,260
without a middleman way,
and by the way,

202
00:11:41,261 --> 00:11:44,290
if you do make good music and you want 
some free advertising,

203
00:11:44,291 --> 00:11:45,124
do send us.
He had demos to info@visualpolitic.net 

204
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:50,320
and we can play it in the background of 
some of our videos.

205
00:11:50,321 --> 00:11:51,154
Of course.
Do you remember to add a link to your 

206
00:11:52,301 --> 00:11:53,830
youtube channel?
Meanwhile,

207
00:11:53,831 --> 00:11:54,664
the big question now is will we 
witnessed the advent of a new creative 

208
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,890
destruction process in the music 
industry?

209
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:03,010
