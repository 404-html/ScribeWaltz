1
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,770
Transylvania,
it's like Castlevania with vampires.

2
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:11,693
Yes.
You heard that writes the lands where 

3
00:00:12,901 --> 00:00:13,734
Dracula was born is also the place of 
one of the most significant separatists 

4
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:19,500
conflicts in all of Europe.
In other words,

5
00:00:19,501 --> 00:00:20,520
Transylvania.
Well,

6
00:00:20,521 --> 00:00:25,521
it is the perfect place to make a visual
politic Halloween's special and yes,

7
00:00:29,651 --> 00:00:30,011
yes,
yes.

8
00:00:30,011 --> 00:00:30,844
We do read your comments.
We do know that you want to add about 

9
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:34,870
Castlevania and I tell you what,
we are working on it.

10
00:00:34,871 --> 00:00:35,704
It's going to be big.
It's going to be complicated and it's 

11
00:00:37,750 --> 00:00:39,670
also going to be worth the waste,
I promise.

12
00:00:39,671 --> 00:00:41,950
Just sit tight for Catalonia,
but for now,

13
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:42,843
let us get back to Transylvania,
which is a historical region located in 

14
00:00:46,031 --> 00:00:49,080
the center of Romania.
Dislike being in Romania.

15
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,300
Twenty percent of its population doesn't
even speak Romanian.

16
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,193
Instead,
their mother language needs to be 

17
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:55,113
Hungarian.

18
00:00:58,310 --> 00:00:59,143
In some areas.
The number of Hungarian speaking people 

19
00:01:01,031 --> 00:01:04,730
rises to 80 percent.
This area where the Hungarians are,

20
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,540
the majority is cooled.
The CICA landscape almost every year you

21
00:01:07,541 --> 00:01:08,374
can see the massive protests of Zika,
least demanding more autonomy for the 

22
00:01:11,141 --> 00:01:11,974
territory.
These demonstrations are celebrated in 

23
00:01:13,331 --> 00:01:16,210
the main cities.
Transylvania as well as Bucharest,

24
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,240
the Romanian capital and Budapest,
the Hungarian capital,

25
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:22,510
but let's hold on for just a minute 
because things are more complicated than

26
00:01:22,511 --> 00:01:25,690
they seem in facsimiles.
Don't want to have their own country.

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:26,673
Instead,
they wanted to become a special region 

28
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:31,870
instinct of Romania with a very specific
fiscal system.

29
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,960
So the question here is,
well,

30
00:01:34,030 --> 00:01:36,820
why does this cause so many problems for
a while?

31
00:01:36,910 --> 00:01:37,743
All these demands creating such a 
significant diplomatic conflicts as 

32
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:42,280
well.
More importantly,

33
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:44,710
the question is,
what does the Hungarian governments have

34
00:01:44,711 --> 00:01:45,850
to do with this?
Well,

35
00:01:45,890 --> 00:01:47,230
don't worry because today,
well,

36
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,270
of course they're going to answer all of
these questions,

37
00:01:49,271 --> 00:01:51,220
but as usual,
before we do all of that,

38
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,190
let's go back and take a look at the 
history.

39
00:01:57,590 --> 00:02:00,430
Hairy tongue.
It's like for centuries,

40
00:02:00,431 --> 00:02:03,400
Transylvania,
it was part of the Kingdom of Hungary.

41
00:02:03,550 --> 00:02:04,383
Back then it wasn't even a country.
The upper classes and aristocracy spoke 

42
00:02:07,901 --> 00:02:08,734
Hungarian and Romanian.
It was the language spoken by the 

43
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:11,983
present.

44
00:02:12,410 --> 00:02:13,243
Yes,

45
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,580
points in history.
Romanian speakers.

46
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,880
What you've been prosecuted by the 
authorities.

47
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:22,020
We call this process the mega ization.
Basically these Hungarian rule,

48
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,580
they wanted to impose their culture at 
any cost to is rs two grants.

49
00:02:26,581 --> 00:02:28,920
Romanians were sort of hillbillies,
so you had a special love,

50
00:02:28,921 --> 00:02:32,010
the stealing things and a bad sense of 
personal hygiene.

51
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:32,873
In fact,
there was even a term to refer to these 

52
00:02:33,811 --> 00:02:34,644
Romanians.
They were called at Zurich and yell 

53
00:02:35,991 --> 00:02:39,040
view.
This literally means with a hairy

54
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:40,320
hum.

55
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:45,003
So during the 19th century,
the government closed radian speaking 

56
00:02:47,081 --> 00:02:47,914
newspapers and they even forced a lot of
citizens do change their Romanian name 

57
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,860
to re Hungarian one just like this.
Well,

58
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,753
after World War One things,
they really changed the Austrian 

59
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:00,070
Hungarian empire and lost the war.
And one the things that happens when you

60
00:03:00,071 --> 00:03:03,070
lose a war is you usually lose a part of
your territory.

61
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:05,320
One of those parts,
well that was Transylvania,

62
00:03:05,321 --> 00:03:06,154
which was incorporated into Romanian.
Suddenly these peasants that were 

63
00:03:09,431 --> 00:03:13,740
oppressed by the Hungarian ability that 
they have power and that power,

64
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,613
well they wanted revenge and this is how
the first attempts to destroy the 

65
00:03:18,221 --> 00:03:19,630
Hungarian culture.
Well,

66
00:03:19,631 --> 00:03:24,631
that's how they started.
Well,

67
00:03:26,671 --> 00:03:27,504
it certainly wasn't an easy job.
Do not forget that despite being a part 

68
00:03:31,111 --> 00:03:31,944
of Romania,
Transylvania was the home of over 1 

69
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:37,380
million Hungarian speaking people.
These people,

70
00:03:37,381 --> 00:03:38,214
they were called the weeklies and for 
generations they had been speaking the 

71
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,364
language of Istvan Orkney,
but things they got a whole lot uglier 

72
00:03:44,911 --> 00:03:49,860
during world war two,
Hungary,

73
00:03:49,861 --> 00:03:50,694
well,
they once again chose the wrong side to 

74
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:53,003
ally with with Hitler Elb.
They took it back to their former 

75
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,680
territories and struck back against 
though you see wanted to erase Hungarian

76
00:03:58,681 --> 00:04:01,140
culture in the country.
As you might imagine.

77
00:04:01,141 --> 00:04:03,660
This helps to make the Romanians even 
more angry.

78
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,000
Then in 1945,
well the Germans,

79
00:04:06,001 --> 00:04:07,620
they lost the war.
That meant,

80
00:04:07,621 --> 00:04:08,454
of course,
that the allies also lost and that 

81
00:04:09,451 --> 00:04:10,284
included the Hungarians.
So Romania with a brand new communist 

82
00:04:13,321 --> 00:04:14,100
governments.
Well,

83
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:16,980
they took Transylvania back this time 
though.

84
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,350
They had an even bigger taste for 
payback.

85
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,713
So maybe you remember this other video 
where I told you about the dictatorship 

86
00:04:27,271 --> 00:04:28,104
of Nicolae Ceausescu if you've seen it,
you already know that the communist 

87
00:04:31,441 --> 00:04:32,161
Romania.
Well,

88
00:04:32,161 --> 00:04:35,190
it was the closest thing to a European 
North Korea that existed.

89
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,233
One in every 30 Romanians was a part of 
the political police and so they 

90
00:04:39,211 --> 00:04:41,670
prosecuted not only those who oppose the
government,

91
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:46,410
but even those you dare to speak 
Hungarian from one day to the other,

92
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:50,760
Ceausescu close newspapers and forced 
those chilies to speak Romanian,

93
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:51,460
even in their own

94
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:52,293
heights,

95
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:57,453
major realization,
bad as it was forced a few Romanians to 

96
00:05:00,071 --> 00:05:03,400
change their names.
Romanization was the same sort of thing,

97
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:07,810
just on a way bigger scale,
but hold on for just a moment because it

98
00:05:07,811 --> 00:05:08,644
still doesn't stop here on their path to
destroy even the last resemblance of 

99
00:05:12,251 --> 00:05:13,084
Hungarian culture.
The Romanian Communist Party forced 

100
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:16,233
thousands of citizens do you set up in 
the Hungarian speaking territories this 

101
00:05:19,961 --> 00:05:20,794
way?
Hungarian speaking became a small 

102
00:05:21,611 --> 00:05:24,460
minority in cities like or daycare or 
Saturday morning,

103
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,060
basically the whole area,
the borders with Hungary came a Romanian

104
00:05:28,061 --> 00:05:31,780
majority region this via all of this.
That is a region that did manage to keep

105
00:05:31,781 --> 00:05:33,960
their language and traditions in taxes 
alone.

106
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:36,360
We mentioned earlier,
if the so called secret lab

107
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:41,330
mania

108
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:44,060
steals from us,
so in 1991,

109
00:05:44,061 --> 00:05:44,894
Romania,
it past this brand new democratic 

110
00:05:46,461 --> 00:05:47,294
constitution.
The constitution recognized the invite 

111
00:05:49,011 --> 00:05:51,290
to speak Hungarian,
but as you can imagine,

112
00:05:51,291 --> 00:05:54,540
after decades of hate against Budapest,
those seekers will.

113
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:59,550
They were far from happy.
I mean fiscally Romania.

114
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,223
It's a very centralized country.
Almost all the taxes are collected by 

115
00:06:07,641 --> 00:06:08,474
the central government and then they 
share that money among the regions with 

116
00:06:11,481 --> 00:06:12,314
a focus on the poorest.
Once this boots Transylvanian in a 

117
00:06:14,811 --> 00:06:17,270
pretty bad position,
that's because,

118
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,340
well,
they are one of the wealthiest regions

119
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,633
and so.
Well this is how a new political party 

120
00:06:28,801 --> 00:06:31,690
was born and that would be the 
Democratic Alliance if I'm Gary,

121
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,940
eons of Romania also known as Udm.
All on surprisingly they want.

122
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,260
All the elections in the regions were 
Hungarians are the majority so well.

123
00:06:40,320 --> 00:06:42,090
What are their foundations?
Well,

124
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:45,690
basically they claim that Romania is 
essentially sucking their lifeblood.

125
00:06:45,810 --> 00:06:46,680
That money.
Yeah.

126
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:50,010
It's pretty much the same situation as 
in Catalonia and their solutions.

127
00:06:50,011 --> 00:06:50,844
You end this Romanian losing is 
imitating the fiscal model or they'd 

128
00:06:53,881 --> 00:06:56,610
another Spanish region and that would be
the Basque country.

129
00:06:56,670 --> 00:06:57,503
Unlike other regions,
the bast citizens don't pay their taxes 

130
00:06:59,581 --> 00:07:01,560
to Madrid,
but to their local government

131
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:06,563
collected,
the local government has to give some 

132
00:07:08,131 --> 00:07:08,964
share to the central government,
but the rest is to be managed the way 

133
00:07:11,221 --> 00:07:14,250
the local government wants.
So this was the system that was proposed

134
00:07:14,251 --> 00:07:17,820
by the seekers in 2014.
Guess what?

135
00:07:17,821 --> 00:07:19,650
The Romanian government replies,
well,

136
00:07:19,651 --> 00:07:21,240
they said it was against the 
constitution.

137
00:07:21,270 --> 00:07:24,420
There are any constitution starts off by
saying that it is a sovereign,

138
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:27,750
unitary and Indian visible country.
Now,

139
00:07:27,751 --> 00:07:28,584
of course this is something that created
a whole lot of protests and a whole lot 

140
00:07:31,381 --> 00:07:34,230
of different cities.
There were a referendum attempts and all

141
00:07:34,231 --> 00:07:35,064
sorts of other symbolic objections,
and these are all things that really 

142
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:38,973
just the Romanian ruling class,
manias ruling party threatens autonomy 

143
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:49,590
seeking Transylvanian Hungarians with 
printers and punishment.

144
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:50,573
Attempts that threatened the 
constitutional order of Romania should 

145
00:07:52,681 --> 00:07:55,260
be punished with prison.
If you've been following the case of the

146
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,260
Catalonian separatists,
well this might sound pretty familiar to

147
00:07:58,261 --> 00:08:00,720
you,
but hold on just a second because one of

148
00:08:00,721 --> 00:08:02,340
the best.
It's yet to come.

149
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:08,180
Autonomy or annexation,
if any of you have ever been hungry,

150
00:08:08,210 --> 00:08:11,870
I'm sure you might've seen someone 
wearing this tee shirt with this map.

151
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,040
It represents the shape of hungry before
losing a part of that territory's before

152
00:08:16,041 --> 00:08:17,390
World War One.
Yeah.

153
00:08:17,391 --> 00:08:19,740
Even today in the 21st century,
a lot of fun,

154
00:08:19,741 --> 00:08:20,574
Gary,
and keep dreaming about taking that old 

155
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,730
empire back and among them you'll find 
the presidents of Viktor Orban,

156
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:26,930
the Vladimir Putin.

157
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,380
You just

158
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:31,243
like the Russian president.
Orban is famous for prosecuting 

159
00:08:33,371 --> 00:08:34,204
journalists who dare to criticize him.
He has passed anti gay laws and he wins 

160
00:08:37,540 --> 00:08:41,820
elections with 60 percent of the votes 
and of course like every year to Putin.

161
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:44,500
Orbin likes to rule not only his own 
country,

162
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:49,070
but others too or bonds supports the 
autonomy of the CSI.

163
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:50,170
Kelly's.
Alright.

164
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,650
Alright.
Alright.

165
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,483
I know what you're thinking.
Why does a president from another 

166
00:08:52,781 --> 00:08:55,590
country missed with the internal 
politics of another?

167
00:08:55,591 --> 00:08:56,424
I mean at the end of the day what the 
seekers wanted just to have more 

168
00:08:58,861 --> 00:09:01,620
autonomy but without leaving Romania.
Right?

169
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,020
Well,
in fact they're senior citizens are also

170
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:04,883
his citizens

171
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:10,340
grants citizenship rights to ethnic 
Hungarians abroad.

172
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:11,181
Yeah,
you heard that,

173
00:09:11,181 --> 00:09:12,014
right?
All of those Transylvanian born 

174
00:09:13,041 --> 00:09:15,080
Hungarians,
they have two passports.

175
00:09:15,081 --> 00:09:15,914
They have the right to study in Hungary,
and of course they get to vote in 

176
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:20,090
Hungarian elections.
This last thing,

177
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:21,620
oh,
it's pretty good for urban.

178
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,410
I mean he's popular in suite of 
Hungarian borders,

179
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,590
but outside he absolutely steals the 
show.

180
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,700
Ninety five percent of Hungarians from 
abroad voted for his party at the latest

181
00:09:31,701 --> 00:09:33,560
legislative elections.
Meanwhile,

182
00:09:33,561 --> 00:09:34,394
Romania considers these rights for the 
seekers as a complete violation of that 

183
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:42,130
sovereignty.
In their opinion.

184
00:09:42,591 --> 00:09:43,424
If you voted to different countries,
you can't be loyal to the one where you 

185
00:09:46,251 --> 00:09:49,190
live.
All this means that diplomatic relations

186
00:09:49,191 --> 00:09:52,850
between Hungary and Romania,
pretty darn complicated,

187
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:53,773
thanks to this open can use Romania as 
an antagonist to his nationalist 

188
00:09:57,141 --> 00:10:00,650
propaganda and then Romania where it 
gets a great chance to give some shit to

189
00:10:00,651 --> 00:10:02,870
Hungary when it comes to European 
politics.

190
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:07,950
So now this probably leads you onto the 
question of,

191
00:10:07,951 --> 00:10:09,420
well,
what's the European Union?

192
00:10:09,421 --> 00:10:11,220
Think about all of this.
The truth is,

193
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,770
despite the Council of Europe writing 
memorandums,

194
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:15,720
would they defend the rights of ethnic 
minorities?

195
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:18,300
Brussels would never let Hungary when at
the end of the day,

196
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:19,193
Viktor Orban is like the Dracula 
Frankenstein and Freddy Kruger of 

197
00:10:22,261 --> 00:10:25,080
European politics,
so as long as things don't turn ugly,

198
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:29,070
don't expect any position from any EU 
institution or politician

199
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,033
is what we think our official politic 
and now we'd love to know what you 

200
00:10:35,871 --> 00:10:36,704
think.
Do you think Transylvania should have 

201
00:10:37,491 --> 00:10:39,570
its own autonomy or perhaps this is 
nothing.

202
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:43,160
This attempts by hungry to get some sway
back on that form it territories.

203
00:10:43,280 --> 00:10:44,113
Well,
leave your answers in the comments

We would love to hear from you.

Meanwhile,
if you want to know more about the old 

206
00:10:48,890 --> 00:10:51,980
Romanian communist system and the 
current Terrainian and corrupt system,
