1
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:08,503
The conflicts between Israel and 
Palestine is one of them is complicated 

2
00:00:10,551 --> 00:00:12,830
in international politics and as you all
probably know,

3
00:00:12,831 --> 00:00:13,664
it's one of the most controversial 
political situations in the entire 

4
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,694
world.
In order to make it easier in this 

5
00:00:18,051 --> 00:00:18,884
video,
we're going to tackle the very delicate 

6
00:00:20,151 --> 00:00:22,580
issue of the Israeli settlements in the 
West Bank,

7
00:00:22,610 --> 00:00:23,443
and this is a pretty major issue because
almost all countries find these 

8
00:00:25,851 --> 00:00:30,290
settlements to be a serious violation of
international law in the last 40 years.

9
00:00:30,291 --> 00:00:31,124
All of the administrations in the United
States have taken a position against 

10
00:00:33,681 --> 00:00:34,910
them,
and when I say them,

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:35,833
I do mean all of them and yes,
this matter has compromised the special 

12
00:00:38,601 --> 00:00:41,120
relationship that exists between the US 
and Israel.

13
00:00:41,180 --> 00:00:43,970
And I'm not talking about governments 
like Jimmy Carter's yet,

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:44,990
not at all.
Indeed,

15
00:00:44,991 --> 00:00:45,824
Ronald Reagan himself demanded the 
immediate freeze of any new settlements 

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,050
as he claims they were an evident 
obstacles piece.

17
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:51,913
George Hw Bush threatens to take 
disciplinary measures of an economic 

18
00:00:54,591 --> 00:00:55,424
nature,
and then Bill Clinton proposed a law to 

19
00:00:57,081 --> 00:00:59,750
punish Israel by reducing American 
assistance.

20
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,613
Even today at trump's administration has
asked Israel to stop being such a pain 

21
00:01:03,651 --> 00:01:06,620
in the ass about it.
Since taking office in January,

22
00:01:06,621 --> 00:01:10,310
trump has publicly asked Netanyahu to 
constrain suddenly construction,

23
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:13,160
but has not condemned.
The State Department has said that it is

24
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:13,994
not helpful to the peace process.
So what do you think Israel has done in 

25
00:01:16,731 --> 00:01:18,530
the face of all this criticism?
Well,

26
00:01:18,531 --> 00:01:22,070
they have basically ignored it and have 
kept expanding their settlements,

27
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,780
but okay,
now we are here.

28
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:24,643
You might be wondering what are these 
settlements and what do they really 

29
00:01:27,201 --> 00:01:28,011
mean?
Well,

30
00:01:28,011 --> 00:01:33,011
let's have a look at that.
Settlers and settlement.

31
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:37,923
Last thing we need to know is that 
according to agreements that have been 

32
00:01:39,671 --> 00:01:40,900
reached,
the territory,

33
00:01:40,910 --> 00:01:44,980
your state of Palestine is formed by 
what is today known as the West Bank and

34
00:01:44,981 --> 00:01:45,814
the Gaza Strip.
These territories corresponds to the 

35
00:01:47,591 --> 00:01:48,424
political map prior to the six day war,
after which Israel occupied these 

36
00:01:51,581 --> 00:01:53,770
territories which used to belong to 
Jordan.

37
00:01:53,830 --> 00:01:56,440
So the settlements,
they are essentially communities,

38
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,333
villages,
towns and cities that Israel has been 

39
00:01:59,081 --> 00:02:01,910
building since 1970.
In the West Bank territory.

40
00:02:01,911 --> 00:02:02,744
You have the future Palestinian state 
and it is not just a few houses we're 

41
00:02:05,561 --> 00:02:06,394
talking about here.
The West Bank is a small territory at 

42
00:02:08,111 --> 00:02:10,300
belly 5,600
square kilometers,

43
00:02:10,301 --> 00:02:12,070
which is about the size of the state of 
Delaware,

44
00:02:12,100 --> 00:02:14,950
but even so,
and this is not considering east theresa

45
00:02:14,951 --> 00:02:15,784
limp plant,
a 131 settlements and furthermore there 

46
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:21,790
are an additional 97 out posts.
These are posts,

47
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:24,130
they are settlements as well if it in 
these cases,

48
00:02:24,131 --> 00:02:27,040
these settlements are illegal even under
Israeli law.

49
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,400
These are posts they were built without 
the consent of the Israeli government.

50
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:31,273
That means that there are more than 228 
Israeli settlements around the West 

51
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:35,913
Bank.
Many are in places of relevant value 

52
00:02:37,241 --> 00:02:38,074
like aquifers and that makes it more 
complicated because roads and 

53
00:02:40,721 --> 00:02:43,330
infrastructure need to be set up in 
order to connect to them.

54
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,193
Besides Israel needs to protect these 
settlements and that involves police 

55
00:02:46,871 --> 00:02:47,704
patrolling around the West Bank,
which affects the mobility of 

56
00:02:49,631 --> 00:02:52,840
Palestinians and makes economic 
development even more difficult,

57
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:56,640
and the

58
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,360
problem isn't just the existence of 
these is that they don't stop growing in

59
00:03:01,361 --> 00:03:02,194
the last year,
more than 2000 new buildings have 

60
00:03:03,821 --> 00:03:06,990
started to be constructed and there are 
plans to build $3,000

61
00:03:06,991 --> 00:03:09,760
more in the next year alone.
Obviously in addition to this,

62
00:03:09,761 --> 00:03:11,590
there are also medical centers,
schools,

63
00:03:11,591 --> 00:03:12,880
synagogues,
etc.

64
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:13,743
So once the result of all of this,
well take a look at this chart to see 

65
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,370
how the population has evolved.

66
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,350
So now you might be asking,
well,

67
00:03:25,410 --> 00:03:26,243
what's the problem here?
Those who are pro settlements claim 

68
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:31,110
these population centers are growing 
where they used to be nothing.

69
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:31,973
Consider what the mayor of marley,
I remember sounds about one of the main 

70
00:03:34,351 --> 00:03:37,080
settlements.
We didn't steal the land from anybody.

71
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:37,973
It was built on empty hills.
You can see there the desert rocks and 

72
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:42,450
sand.
Now you have a living city.

73
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:45,360
Then in cash rail mayor of ma'ale,
adumim,

74
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,490
ma'ale.
Adam is a city of 40,000

75
00:03:47,491 --> 00:03:49,380
inhabitants with schools,
kindergartens,

76
00:03:49,381 --> 00:03:50,360
a theater,
a library,

77
00:03:50,361 --> 00:03:54,000
and industrial center according to the 
residents that it's a complete city.

78
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:54,750
All right.
Again,

79
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,583
so what exactly is the problem?
the problem is that in order to solve 

80
00:03:57,781 --> 00:03:58,614
the Israel palestine conflict,
all parties agree the two states and 

81
00:04:02,021 --> 00:04:04,680
necessary one being Israel and to being 
palestine,

82
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,740
but with all the sediments,
palestinian sovereignty in the west bank

83
00:04:07,741 --> 00:04:11,460
will be in serious danger because Israel
has already said they will never give up

84
00:04:11,461 --> 00:04:14,400
sovereignty over these places,
and that includes the roads,

85
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,290
the infrastructure,
the security controls.

86
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,183
Let's be clear,
palestine will be unable to become an 

87
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:22,080
effective and autonomous state with such
limitations,

88
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:23,910
especially considering these 
settlements.

89
00:04:23,911 --> 00:04:24,744
Waves stopped growing.
Settlements are illegal under 

90
00:04:26,551 --> 00:04:27,960
international law.
At present,

91
00:04:27,961 --> 00:04:28,794
one of the main impediments to peace 
nicola and letting of united nations 

92
00:04:31,981 --> 00:04:32,814
envoy on middle east peace.
So now you can probably understand why 

93
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,720
this topic makes everyone so 10 years

94
00:04:41,060 --> 00:04:42,140
more and more

95
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:43,223
sure.

96
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,880
Ins and yahoo's settlement policy.
It hasn't stopped growing since 2015.

97
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:51,520
The situation has reached a point and 
it's on the 23rd of December,

98
00:04:51,521 --> 00:04:52,354
2016.
The un security council passed a 

99
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,690
resolution 2134 that strongly condemns 
the israeli settlement policy.

100
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:00,213
Security council reaffirms that the 
establishment by Israel of settlements 

101
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,430
in the palestinian territory occupied 
since 1967,

102
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:07,323
including east jerusalem,
has no legal validity and constitutes a 

103
00:05:09,761 --> 00:05:10,594
flagrant violation under international 
law and a major obstacle to the 

104
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,164
achievement of a two state solution and 
just lasting and comprehensive peace 

105
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,320
resolution to three,
three slash four of the security council

106
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:21,543
resolution could be passed because for 
the first time the us didn't use their 

107
00:05:24,131 --> 00:05:24,964
rights to veto the resolution as well.
This is something that made netanyahu's 

108
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:28,283
governments really furious.
The prime miniSter didn't hesitate in 

109
00:05:30,641 --> 00:05:31,474
describing the situation is absurd.
Even accused barack obama's 

110
00:05:33,881 --> 00:05:34,714
administration in public.
I've tried to carry out a shameful anti 

111
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:39,130
israeli maneuver,
so yeah,

112
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,370
he was pretty angry,
but this resolution shouldn't have taken

113
00:05:42,790 --> 00:05:43,623
you by surprise given some of the 
decisions he announced in 2016 and 

114
00:05:46,601 --> 00:05:48,580
confirmed in 2017

115
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:54,750
ready governments has started a new 
settlements in the west bank,

116
00:05:54,751 --> 00:05:55,584
which is the first for two decades,
so Israel not only has decided to 

117
00:05:58,371 --> 00:05:59,204
encourage the existing settlements,
but they've even started a new one on 

118
00:06:02,271 --> 00:06:03,104
the other hands,
maybe a powered by the alleged good 

119
00:06:04,881 --> 00:06:05,714
relations with trump.
The parliaments in Israel after lots of 

120
00:06:07,941 --> 00:06:08,774
controversy.
It finally passed a new law in the 

121
00:06:10,101 --> 00:06:13,760
beginning of 2017.
This lot legalized is around 4,000

122
00:06:13,761 --> 00:06:18,350
houses built on palestinian private 
property houses that the israeli supreme

123
00:06:18,351 --> 00:06:19,184
court had even ordered to be dismantled.
Rules of the game have changed with 

124
00:06:22,941 --> 00:06:23,774
donald trump's arrival as president.
We no longer have our hands tied as we 

125
00:06:25,851 --> 00:06:26,684
did in the time of barack obama.
Now we could finally build and take 

126
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:29,840
that.
As we said before,

127
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:30,674
the fact that trump might look closer to
Israel doesn't mean that his 

128
00:06:32,811 --> 00:06:35,960
administration isn't also tired.
Of this settlement issue,

129
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,853
that is why I'm in order to regain 
trump's favorite jerusalem is committed 

130
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,153
to starting a new policy that seems to 
slow down the growth of existing 

131
00:06:43,131 --> 00:06:45,740
settlements and forbid outposts.
It's completely,

132
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,633
but the new policy,
it's so cryptic and complicated that it 

133
00:06:48,561 --> 00:06:50,320
seems very likely.
These settlements,

134
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,183
they'll just keep growing and now you 
probably have another question which is 

135
00:06:52,970 --> 00:06:55,340
why do these settlements are they grow 
so much?

136
00:06:55,370 --> 00:06:57,110
Well,
pay close attention here,

137
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:01,803
inexplicably policy thinking about it.
Why do so many israelis want to live in 

138
00:07:07,181 --> 00:07:08,014
these conflict zones?
Is it because maybe there are some 

139
00:07:09,551 --> 00:07:12,280
valuable natural resources to be 
exploited as well?

140
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:15,700
NoT really the explanation.
It's much less creative.

141
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:19,630
The government of Israel is subsidizing 
the establishment of these settlements.

142
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:21,640
That's right.
The government in Israel,

143
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,710
[inaudible] finances,
the construction of houses,

144
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:28,150
creating discounts of almost 70 percent 
for the price of land and offers a great

145
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:31,030
deal of financial aid and you know the 
results as well.

146
00:07:31,031 --> 00:07:35,310
Houses are 40 percent cheaper than in 
the formal territory of Israel and say,

147
00:07:35,350 --> 00:07:36,183
well,
that's not all the governments of 

148
00:07:36,761 --> 00:07:37,594
Israel.
Also interested is to get our take and 

149
00:07:38,650 --> 00:07:42,100
provides all kinds of public services,
so as you can imagine,

150
00:07:42,101 --> 00:07:42,934
the youth ends.
Many families see these as places where 

151
00:07:45,011 --> 00:07:48,550
they can have a better life than they 
could in israel's formal territory.

152
00:07:48,640 --> 00:07:49,990
So now the question becomes,
well,

153
00:07:49,991 --> 00:07:52,180
how does Israel itself benefit from 
this?

154
00:07:52,210 --> 00:07:54,140
Well,
the truth is they really don't.

155
00:07:54,141 --> 00:07:54,974
So an exchange,
they get just a bunch of political and 

156
00:07:56,741 --> 00:07:57,574
economic problems.
These settlements aren't just an 

157
00:07:59,141 --> 00:07:59,974
obstacle for the peace process and 
foreign policy because they are also a 

158
00:08:02,411 --> 00:08:05,050
big waste of public money.
So look with the subsidies,

159
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:05,884
the security,
the expensive public services for these 

160
00:08:07,391 --> 00:08:10,180
now foundation and the advert center.
Both israeli by the way,

161
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,510
estimate that the cost of these is more 
than a billion dollars a year.

162
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,373
In other words,
this is nothing that's an expensive 

163
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:20,320
policy both for the citizens of 
palestine as well as those of Israel.

164
00:08:26,570 --> 00:08:27,560
To get fooled,

165
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,993
let me be absolutely clear.
Israel is a country full of positive 

166
00:08:33,721 --> 00:08:35,490
things like that.
Neighboring countries.

167
00:08:35,491 --> 00:08:36,324
Israel is a consolidated democracy with 
strong civil liberties and a prosperous 

168
00:08:40,021 --> 00:08:42,990
and innovative economy.
Many of the products and services we use

169
00:08:42,991 --> 00:08:43,824
everyday wouldn't exist if it weren't 
for the technology developed in Israel 

170
00:08:46,290 --> 00:08:47,123
and don't be false.
Putting an end to these settlements 

171
00:08:48,541 --> 00:08:52,830
wouldn't mean and ends of the conflicts 
because there is a precedence in 2005.

172
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,664
Israel left the gaza strip,
completely stopping all the settlements 

173
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:56,934
and removing all civilians and soldiers 
and the result was neither piece nor 

174
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,074
prosperity.
The strip is now Controlled by hamas 

175
00:09:02,641 --> 00:09:03,474
radicals and it is even in conflict with
the government to palestine itself and 

176
00:09:06,391 --> 00:09:09,270
the situation isn't good from a 
humanitarian perspective,

177
00:09:09,271 --> 00:09:10,104
but it definitely doesn't justify the 
settlement policy of Israel and their 

178
00:09:12,991 --> 00:09:15,000
lack of commitment towards the peace 
agreements.

179
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:18,600
And so now the question is,
is there really any possible solution to

180
00:09:18,601 --> 00:09:19,340
this conflict?

181
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:21,300
Well,
more and more experts claim the solution

182
00:09:21,301 --> 00:09:22,134
needs to be a bottom up strategy.
That is to say encourage economic 

183
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,184
development in the west bank.
Establish a dialogue and understanding 

184
00:09:28,501 --> 00:09:29,334
where trade relations between israelis 
and palestinians and normal answer lets 

185
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,730
the national authorities in palestine 
have more jurisdiction.

186
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:37,500
These,
they will require time,

187
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:40,230
but more than that they require 
commitments.

188
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:40,621
I said,
no,

189
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,630
it's your turn.
What do you think should happen with the

190
00:09:42,631 --> 00:09:43,351
settlements?
