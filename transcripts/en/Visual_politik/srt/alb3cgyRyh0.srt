1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,060
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:08,003
let me start with question.
Where do you think there is more 

3
00:00:10,021 --> 00:00:10,854
inequality?
Is it in silicon valley or isn't in 

4
00:00:13,321 --> 00:00:14,520
Burundi?
Exactly.

5
00:00:14,521 --> 00:00:16,530
The answer of course is silicon valley.

6
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,850
This is not actually necessarily bad 
news.

7
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:24,713
For example,
imagine that you work as a systems 

8
00:00:25,981 --> 00:00:28,950
engineer at the Cisco officers in San 
Jose.

9
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,910
You can make around $7,500 a month.
Not Bad.

10
00:00:32,911 --> 00:00:33,780
Right?
Well,

11
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:34,673
if you could go that with your friends 
who works as a software engineer at 

12
00:00:36,781 --> 00:00:39,840
Google,
you're going to feel like a beg APP.

13
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:44,460
Somebody in that position can easily 
make more than $11,000 a month.

14
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:45,533
And of course all of that is pretty much
pennies if you compare it to the 

15
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:49,044
earnings of your neighbors,
Elon Musk and mark Zuckerberg or any of 

16
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:54,900
the other tycoons sniffing in the area.
In other words,

17
00:00:54,901 --> 00:00:55,734
anybody would feel poor living amongst 
the people with the world's largest 

18
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:01,350
fortunes and yes,
I can guess we were thinking,

19
00:01:01,351 --> 00:01:02,184
I mean it surely it's not so bad to live
in a city where people are making 

20
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,840
$150,000 a year on average.

21
00:01:12,030 --> 00:01:12,863
All right,
so I can probably guess where you're 

22
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:14,740
thinking right now.
You're probably thinking,

23
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,574
well,
living in the city web poor people make 

24
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:21,040
$150,000 a year is going to be a pretty 
good place to live,

25
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:22,090
right?
Well,

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,640
yes,
but as we say,

27
00:01:24,641 --> 00:01:25,474
things aren't always as good as they see
in an area with so much concentrated 

28
00:01:29,411 --> 00:01:30,244
wealth.
Well,

29
00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:31,880
what do you think happens?
Yup.

30
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:36,010
Prices go absolutely.
Sky High.

31
00:01:36,220 --> 00:01:37,053
For example,
how much do you think you'd have to pay 

32
00:01:38,201 --> 00:01:41,140
to rent a two bedroom apartment in 
mountain view?

33
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,280
Mountain view,
by the way,

34
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:45,040
is where Google has his headquarters and
do note here.

35
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:48,940
We're not talking about a big metropolis
like New York City or London.

36
00:01:48,970 --> 00:01:49,803
This town's population would fit 
comfortably in the middle of somewhere 

37
00:01:52,571 --> 00:01:53,404
like,
oh yeah.

38
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,890
All right,

39
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,753
so that being said,
how much do you think you should pay 

40
00:01:59,811 --> 00:02:01,610
$500 a month,
$1,000 a month,

41
00:02:01,611 --> 00:02:04,860
$2,000 a month?
Well after several google searches,

42
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,880
the cheapest rent we could find was 
$3,400 the cheapest in general houses in

43
00:02:11,331 --> 00:02:15,110
Silicon Valley are 60% more expensive 
than elsewhere in America.

44
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:16,063
And I know,
I know with a salary of $11,000 a month 

45
00:02:18,511 --> 00:02:22,280
for your more than happy to pay $3,500 a
month in rent.

46
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:23,900
Right?
Well,

47
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:26,390
absolutely.
But let's just think for a moment.

48
00:02:26,391 --> 00:02:27,410
We've got to think about,
well,

49
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,550
what Silicon Valley really famous for,
and it's famous for entrepreneurs.

50
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:34,880
The main appeal of Silicon Valley is not
working for facebook.

51
00:02:34,881 --> 00:02:38,720
It's for starting your own facebook.
So now think about it.

52
00:02:38,721 --> 00:02:41,720
What do you really want to start a 
company in such an expensive place?

53
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:44,810
Maybe knots,
which explains this.

54
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:47,920
The tech

55
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,720
elite are abandoning silicon valley in 
droves because of group think and out of

56
00:02:52,721 --> 00:02:54,040
control.
Living costs.

57
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:55,540
Yeah,
you have that right.

58
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:56,493
In the year 2017 silicon valley had 
negative net for the first time in 

59
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,893
decades.
This means there were more people 

60
00:03:03,551 --> 00:03:04,384
leaving than coming in,
and this is surprising if we take into 

61
00:03:06,761 --> 00:03:07,594
account that this area of the world was 
growing like crazy since the year 1950 

62
00:03:12,310 --> 00:03:13,600
take mountain view.
For example,

63
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:17,050
in 1950 this town was no bigger than 
6,000 inhabitants.

64
00:03:17,051 --> 00:03:22,051
Now it has more than 81,000 and the same
map and with the rest of the area.

65
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:24,280
Nonetheless,
according to a survey,

66
00:03:24,281 --> 00:03:25,114
half of the residents are seriously 
considering leaving because of the high 

67
00:03:28,571 --> 00:03:31,270
cost of living.
Some of them have already left and among

68
00:03:31,271 --> 00:03:33,220
them is the man you see here.

69
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,573
Teal leaves Silicon Valley for Los 
Angeles and guys you've never heard of 

70
00:03:41,311 --> 00:03:42,144
him.
He gtl is something like Silicon 

71
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:45,870
Valley's Santa Claus along with Elon 
Musk.

72
00:03:45,871 --> 00:03:48,480
He's one of the founders of paypal.
After that,

73
00:03:48,481 --> 00:03:49,314
he became a venture capitalist and we'd 
say he's basically facebook's godfather 

74
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:54,173
please.
Steve was the one who put serious money 

75
00:03:54,931 --> 00:03:57,480
into this company when it was taking its
first baby steps,

76
00:03:57,570 --> 00:04:02,550
but the question now is why are there so
many people leaving Silicon Valley?

77
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:06,720
Is the cost of living really the only 
reason or are there others?

78
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:07,643
And most importantly,
is this the end of Silicon Valley as we 

79
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:11,184
know it?
Well today we're going to answer all of 

80
00:04:12,451 --> 00:04:14,250
those questions,
but before we do,

81
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:19,860
let's take a look back at the history 
country for entrepreneurs.

82
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:28,060
Now in another visual politic video,
we told you how a silicon valley startup

83
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,073
gets financed.
We talked about the so called startup 

84
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:35,080
financing cycle.
And of course silicon valley is the best

85
00:04:35,081 --> 00:04:39,400
place on earth to find people ready to 
bat on your idea as another bonus.

86
00:04:39,401 --> 00:04:43,060
This place is the Disneyland of skilled 
workforces.

87
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:46,270
If you want to start a company that 
manufactures self driving cars,

88
00:04:46,271 --> 00:04:49,210
you need people who've mastered the 
latest technology

89
00:04:49,370 --> 00:04:50,203
drinks.

90
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:56,850
And the reality is you ain't gonna find 
them in the middle of Wyoming.

91
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:01,560
The most talented people they gather in 
Silicon Valley and they're ready to hire

92
00:05:01,980 --> 00:05:03,870
or get hired.
So well,

93
00:05:03,900 --> 00:05:04,860
what's the problem?
Well,

94
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,723
these tons of people you would like to 
hire for your brand new startup and now 

95
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:11,190
do busy earning $150,000 a year at 
Google.

96
00:05:11,340 --> 00:05:12,480
And yeah,
your idea,

97
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:15,000
it might be disruptive and it might be 
innovative,

98
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,834
but yet can't compete with the salaries 
and especially the stability that a 

99
00:05:19,741 --> 00:05:21,890
giant like a Google can provide,

100
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:24,750
right?
Snap

101
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:28,990
a startup in a garage with the garage 
costs millions of dollars.

102
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,530
Odd.
Jay Ryan from Mithril capital talking to

103
00:05:32,531 --> 00:05:34,990
the economist,
but this isn't the end of the story.

104
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,853
Remember,
California has the highest taxes in the 

105
00:05:37,571 --> 00:05:41,590
entire United States and things.
They don't just stop that.

106
00:05:41,650 --> 00:05:42,483
You see in America,
states have plenty of autonomy to raise 

107
00:05:44,681 --> 00:05:48,670
or lower taxes and can even decide how 
they want to collect those taxes.

108
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:50,060
For example,
the state of taxes,

109
00:05:50,061 --> 00:05:50,894
it doesn't have an income tax.
Most of the taxes they collect the 

110
00:05:52,841 --> 00:05:53,674
through in direct taxation,
there's all the taxes that you pay on 

111
00:05:56,831 --> 00:05:59,090
top of the things you buy.
California,

112
00:05:59,150 --> 00:05:59,983
they're the opposite.
They're very little value added tax and 

113
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:06,110
most of the collection comes from 
workers' salaries and especially capital

114
00:06:06,111 --> 00:06:06,944
gains.

115
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:10,853
In other words,
if you're an investor and you're making 

116
00:06:11,911 --> 00:06:12,744
a loss of money this year,
you had better get your wallet ready 

117
00:06:14,751 --> 00:06:18,920
because California is going to charge 
you more than anywhere else and this,

118
00:06:18,921 --> 00:06:19,754
this is not exactly great news when you 
consider that silicon valley is what it 

119
00:06:22,401 --> 00:06:25,130
is because of venture capitalists.
Nonetheless,

120
00:06:25,131 --> 00:06:27,800
this is not the only reason why people 
are leaving the valley.

121
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:28,753
For example,
Peter Teal hasn't left because of state 

122
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,034
taxes,
otherwise he wouldn't have gone to Los 

123
00:06:32,660 --> 00:06:33,800
Angeles,
which is in California.

124
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:37,640
The truth is that a lot of people like 
believe that Silicon Valley has lost all

125
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:39,940
of the diversity that it used to be 
famous.

126
00:06:40,130 --> 00:06:40,963
Hello,

127
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:44,843
Peter Teal.
Silicon Valley has become a one party 

128
00:06:46,861 --> 00:06:47,640
state.

129
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:50,310
Basically,
Peter Teal supported Donald Trump during

130
00:06:50,311 --> 00:06:51,144
the campaign and apparently this kind of
thing is not very well regarded in the 

131
00:06:53,941 --> 00:06:56,880
valley where liberal thinking as King 
Allen's well,

132
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,773
truth be told,
there are many reasons why silicon 

133
00:06:59,941 --> 00:07:03,690
valley people are not big fans of Donald
Trump and well,

134
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,010
that's explore those reasons.

135
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:05,933
Speed

136
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:09,460
One b

137
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:11,170
June.
When I told you that the greatest amount

138
00:07:11,171 --> 00:07:13,990
of talent on the planet is located in 
Silicon Valley.

139
00:07:13,991 --> 00:07:15,370
Well,
I didn't misspeak.

140
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:16,263
I did mean planet and not just America.
This means that 57% of the people 

141
00:07:19,931 --> 00:07:23,740
working for the tech companies in the 
valley come from other countries.

142
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:26,350
Yes,
this is an industry with more immigrants

143
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,283
on the locals and well,
how do these immigrants get into 

144
00:07:29,651 --> 00:07:30,484
America?
Well,

145
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,700
that's easy.
They use the famous h one b visa.

146
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:34,893
Basically,
this is a visa that allows you to stay 

147
00:07:36,911 --> 00:07:39,550
on US territory for between three and 
six.

148
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:41,483
Cheers,

149
00:07:43,790 --> 00:07:44,623
get it.
You must be hired by a company that can 

150
00:07:46,911 --> 00:07:47,744
prove that your skills are both 
necessary to its operations and that 

151
00:07:50,871 --> 00:07:53,450
those skills cannot be provided by 
domestic work

152
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:54,463
groups

153
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:58,640
fired.
You have one month to find another job.

154
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:01,880
You can't find another job.
You must leave America.

155
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,123
Of course,
this visa is requested by the employer 

156
00:08:05,261 --> 00:08:07,090
and the government can deny it if they 
want to.

157
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:10,330
And most importantly,
these visas are limited.

158
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:14,170
They can issue a maximum of 65,000 in 
the entire country.

159
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,850
As you can imagine.
A good share of them.

160
00:08:15,851 --> 00:08:16,684
Go to those workers.
Emigrating to silicon valley for a 

161
00:08:18,731 --> 00:08:20,120
better understanding.
Justin,

162
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:20,973
the year 2016 google and apple hides 
more than 5,000 people through this 

163
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:28,210
process and of course you can probably 
work out what I'm going to say next.

164
00:08:28,270 --> 00:08:31,090
Donald Trump ain't exactly a fan of the 
h one b

165
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:39,460
trump's hire American order.
It makes it harder to get h one b visas.

166
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:40,500
No,
I don't know about you,

167
00:08:40,501 --> 00:08:42,060
but backwards.
Donald Trump took office.

168
00:08:42,061 --> 00:08:45,990
We made a video where we explained all 
of the powers that the president has,

169
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:46,943
these other things that he can do 
without having to get a vote in 

170
00:08:48,901 --> 00:08:51,540
Congress.
Border control is one of them and if you

171
00:08:51,541 --> 00:08:52,374
saw that video,
which is actually one of the first we 

172
00:08:53,281 --> 00:08:54,114
ever made on this channel,
you will remember Obama was just as 

173
00:08:56,551 --> 00:09:01,551
restrictive on immigration as Donald 
Trump us.

174
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:08,780
The devil here is very much in the 
details and one of the details is this h

175
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:09,614
one b visa.
It's in fact a very small detail that 

176
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:13,790
makes a big problem in silicon.

177
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:18,240
Holly Silicon Valley's

178
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:20,720
stalls.
Hiring a foreign tech workers,

179
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:25,930
employer requests to interview 
candidates fall 37% on trump immigration

180
00:09:26,301 --> 00:09:27,134
fears

181
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,973
according to some media.
Many of these tech companies might open 

182
00:09:29,961 --> 00:09:33,620
new offices in countries like Canada 
where it's easier to hire immigrants,

183
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:37,160
but so far we don't have any data as to 
whether this is actually happening or if

184
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:38,990
it's ever really going to happen on the 
last,

185
00:09:38,991 --> 00:09:42,770
the question we can already start 
answering is this were good.

186
00:09:42,771 --> 00:09:45,920
The next tech capital of the welds be,
well,

187
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:51,250
we're going to tell you right now from 
Palo Alto to shenzen,

188
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,563
if you google it,
you'll discover that almost every city 

189
00:09:55,521 --> 00:09:56,354
wants to become the new silicon valley.
You just need to find a journalist who 

190
00:09:58,641 --> 00:09:59,474
finds a couple of computer programmers 
working together and you've already got 

191
00:10:02,391 --> 00:10:04,760
an article titled the Silicon Valley of

192
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,300
Insert name of your city or region.
Yeah.

193
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,333
For example,
there are lots of wishful articles that 

194
00:10:10,381 --> 00:10:11,214
quoted Berlin as a startup creation hub.
Even the German government is open to 

195
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:18,600
offices in silicon valley so that German
entrepreneurs can find investors.

196
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,613
But the truth is that almost no company 
has managed to seduce those big venture 

197
00:10:22,591 --> 00:10:25,170
capital funds in California at least.

198
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,113
So the big question now is how do we 
know if a city is really becoming a 

199
00:10:32,241 --> 00:10:33,950
technological capital?
Well,

200
00:10:33,951 --> 00:10:34,784
one way of measuring this would be the 
number of Unicorns that have been born 

201
00:10:37,701 --> 00:10:39,380
yet and say now might be asking,
well,

202
00:10:39,381 --> 00:10:41,030
what's a unicorn beside,
of course,

203
00:10:41,031 --> 00:10:42,500
the mythical beast.
Well,

204
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:47,450
a Unicorn is a startup that ends up with
a valuation of over $1 billion.

205
00:10:47,570 --> 00:10:52,490
In 2017 57 startups became unicorns and 
from those 57 startups,

206
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:54,890
18 we're not American.
In fact,

207
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:57,470
China was their country of origin.
Yes,

208
00:10:57,550 --> 00:10:59,900
he was.
We're talking about companies like Dji,

209
00:10:59,901 --> 00:11:02,150
which manufacturers,
drones and Alibaba,

210
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,940
which we talked about here on visual 
politic previously,

211
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,390
and it explains headlines like this one

212
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,460
in this latest growth market.

213
00:11:14,490 --> 00:11:15,750
Yes.
Venture capital,

214
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:17,370
for example,
sequoia capital.

215
00:11:17,371 --> 00:11:19,640
There's a vc fund to born in Silicon 
Valley.

216
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:20,573
They have already opened several offices
in China and I know what you're 

217
00:11:22,951 --> 00:11:23,784
thinking.
Does this really mean that China is 

218
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,450
going to mouth shine America?
Well,

219
00:11:27,510 --> 00:11:28,343
the answer is no.
Other cities like Mumbai in India and 

220
00:11:31,111 --> 00:11:34,950
Tel Aviv in Israel have also attracted a
lot of money from VC funds.

221
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:39,850
You might've heard of a company called a
wix.

222
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:42,970
This is a company that allows you to 
create websites very easily.

223
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,650
Well,
they're from Israel,

224
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:47,760
knew the

225
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,350
country,
has no Unicorns,

226
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:50,393
is real,
does have more than 2% of all of the 

227
00:11:52,261 --> 00:11:55,900
worlds of capital.
That might not seem like a lot of money,

228
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:56,763
but it is if we take into account the 
fact that Israel has a smaller 

229
00:11:59,981 --> 00:12:01,090
population than New York

230
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:01,973
Si.

231
00:12:03,210 --> 00:12:05,880
In summary,
there is no clear alternative to silicon

232
00:12:05,881 --> 00:12:06,714
valley.
Even now with the accidents we talked 

233
00:12:08,011 --> 00:12:10,500
about,
silicon valley still gets more than half

234
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,363
of the money that's invested into 
startups and chances are they're going 

235
00:12:14,161 --> 00:12:17,910
to continue to hold that sway over this 
industry for a long time.

236
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,530
So what's the difference then?
Well,

237
00:12:19,560 --> 00:12:22,530
now there aren't many other places where
good ideas can prospect.

238
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:24,000
In other words,
30 years ago,

239
00:12:24,150 --> 00:12:26,130
if you had a good idea and you wanted to
see it grow,

240
00:12:26,131 --> 00:12:29,880
there was virtually one place to go.
Now you've got many more in,

241
00:12:29,881 --> 00:12:31,760
well this is always good news.

242
00:12:34,730 --> 00:12:35,563
So now the question is,
do you think silicon valley has reached 

243
00:12:37,971 --> 00:12:38,804
its peak in terms of growth or do you 
believe this accidents will stop soon 

244
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:43,940
and that the valley will start growing 
again?

245
00:12:44,090 --> 00:12:44,923
Well,
please leave your arms in the comments

consider it as a podcast that challenges

257
00:13:13,511 --> 00:13:16,540
you to reconsider your views by 
providing context.

258
00:13:16,570 --> 00:13:18,160
But we don't do the thinking.
