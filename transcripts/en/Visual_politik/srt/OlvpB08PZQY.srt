1
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:12,340
Humans keep developing more and more 
powerful weapons and weapons,

2
00:00:12,520 --> 00:00:15,100
the ones they drones,
and then our itinerary came along.

3
00:00:15,101 --> 00:00:18,430
Alan's quite literally blew everything 
else out of the water.

4
00:00:18,490 --> 00:00:20,350
And now today with airplanes,
satellites,

5
00:00:20,351 --> 00:00:21,184
submarines and missiles,
we have a gain that be changed the way 

6
00:00:24,101 --> 00:00:24,934
we make this in facts,
military innovation has produced many 

7
00:00:33,211 --> 00:00:36,930
important technological advances,
but it all does have a limit.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:37,853
The destructive effects of weapons of 
mass destruction or wmds has forced 

9
00:00:41,131 --> 00:00:45,370
rules to limit their use of their 
production and their storage as well.

10
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:46,223
This is completely necessary if we don't
want the planet to be well completely 

11
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:54,480
destroyed,
fight against nuclear proliferation.

12
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:03,270
Wmds can be biological,
chemical,

13
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,220
radiological,
and nuclear,

14
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,000
but the biggest problem we face are 
these nuclear weapons.

15
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,863
This is due to their sheer destructive 
power and because thousands and 

16
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:17,130
thousands of them were accumulated 
during the arms race in the Cold War,

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,180
we will develop a larger and more 
accurate c based ballistic missile.

18
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:22,973
We will also deploy nuclear cruise 
missiles in some existing submarines in 

19
00:01:26,611 --> 00:01:27,444
the 1960s seventies and eighties art and
music and the civil movements took 

20
00:01:30,181 --> 00:01:31,014
action against nuclear weapons.
Maybe you remember flower power or at 

21
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:35,210
least you've probably heard of it.

22
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,913
Okay.

23
00:01:38,140 --> 00:01:38,973
Songs which best represents the story of
these years and they do recommend that 

24
00:01:41,471 --> 00:01:43,370
you've got to listen to them.
If you haven't already know,

25
00:01:43,371 --> 00:01:45,790
La Gay by orchestral maneuvers in the 
dark ends,

26
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,653
99 red balloons.
Real challenge today is keeping North 

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,373
Korea or Iran from continuing that 
programs to develop wmds and further to 

28
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,190
keep such weapons out of the hands of 
terrorist organizations.

29
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:04,853
A nuclear crisis in Korea would be a 
tragedy and it would certainly affect 

30
00:02:07,531 --> 00:02:10,380
globalization,
trade and all very lifestyles.

31
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:11,243
Now the problem here is quite condensed 
and we should really analyze it from a 

32
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:15,090
global perspective.
As we said,

33
00:02:15,091 --> 00:02:15,924
there are international rules which 
limits to the acquisition of nuclear 

34
00:02:18,061 --> 00:02:18,894
weapons.
These rules are classified into two 

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:23,430
different categories,
horizontal nonproliferation.

36
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,293
This is meant to prevents countries 
which don't have these weapons from 

37
00:02:26,431 --> 00:02:27,264
obtaining them and then there is 
vertical nonproliferation and this is 

38
00:02:30,361 --> 00:02:33,090
meant to stop states already in 
possession of nuclear weapons,

39
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,720
especially the US and Russia from 
increasing the number of nuclear weapons

40
00:02:36,721 --> 00:02:40,140
they have and even encouraging,
reducing the stock piles,

41
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:48,260
horizontal non-proliferation.
The NP

42
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:50,560
horizontal

43
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,393
nonproliferation tries to prevent a new 
countries from joining the nuclear club 

44
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,180
as obviously it's specifically aims to 
prevent countries like Iran,

45
00:02:58,270 --> 00:02:59,103
North Korea,
well as terrorist organizations from 

46
00:03:01,030 --> 00:03:03,310
getting these weapons.
Yes.

47
00:03:03,311 --> 00:03:04,144
You might remember now that we did 
another video on this where we talked 

48
00:03:05,891 --> 00:03:06,724
about how the rules aren't really 
working so well in the case of North 

49
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:10,150
Korea.
Well,

50
00:03:10,150 --> 00:03:10,983
this is what the NPT has achieved since 
1968 in the early sixties it was 

51
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:19,441
estimated that by the year 2000 around 
20 countries would hold nuclear weapons.

52
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:21,260
Many countries like Algeria,
Roger,

53
00:03:21,290 --> 00:03:22,031
Dina,
Brazil,

54
00:03:22,031 --> 00:03:22,864
Spain,
and Sweden had the ability to develop 

55
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:25,870
these weapons.
However,

56
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:28,330
thanks to the NPT and international 
leverage,

57
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:31,120
very few states are in possession of 
these weapons today.

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,053
Yeah,

59
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:34,203
clear non proliferation treaty 
established at the five permanent 

60
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,510
members of the Security Council,
which at first where the United States,

61
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,400
the Soviet Union,
China,

62
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,530
France,
and United Kingdom.

63
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:45,453
We're the only nuclear powers and it 
forbade other states from acquiring 

64
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,170
nuclear weapons.

65
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:52,930
It looks great.

66
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:53,763
The members of the nuclear club,
the five nuclear powers would commit to 

67
00:03:56,331 --> 00:03:59,950
help the rest of the countries develop 
nuclear energy for civil public.

68
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,700
However,
with time and despite all of this,

69
00:04:05,701 --> 00:04:08,970
some countries have succeeded in 
becoming nuclear powers today.

70
00:04:08,971 --> 00:04:11,130
Besides the five powers previously 
mentioned,

71
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,760
four more countries have developed 
nuclear weapons.

72
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,060
That's Israel,
India,

73
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:16,920
Pakistan,
and to North Korea.

74
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:19,560
And then there's Iran,
which also try it.

75
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:22,200
You'll probably know that during the 
Ahmadinejad administration,

76
00:04:22,201 --> 00:04:24,270
Iran tried to develop one of these 
bombs,

77
00:04:24,271 --> 00:04:25,104
and this would have meant there would be
a significant threat to both Israel as 

78
00:04:27,931 --> 00:04:30,090
well as the Middle Eastern Region.
But fortunately,

79
00:04:30,091 --> 00:04:30,924
the international community took action 
to flank that possibility and the 

80
00:04:33,211 --> 00:04:35,550
sanctions leveled by the Security 
Council,

81
00:04:35,551 --> 00:04:36,384
damaged Iran's oil and gas exports and 
badly and all of that international 

82
00:04:39,721 --> 00:04:40,554
pressure.
It has an impact because in the next 

83
00:04:41,641 --> 00:04:42,474
elections,
Rohani became the president of the 

84
00:04:43,651 --> 00:04:44,484
country.
He was a more moderate candidates to 

85
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,244
very harsh negotiations.
In 2015 they reached an agreement in 

86
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:52,770
which Iran stopped its nuclear agenda 
and in exchange,

87
00:04:52,771 --> 00:04:55,500
the rest of the countries would lift 
sanctions on exports,

88
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:59,550
which was good news in a country like 
Iran or wary lack of exports was causing

89
00:04:59,551 --> 00:05:01,740
significant damage to its economy.
Well,

90
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:02,603
now we come to North Korea ans maybe we 
should let it to leader speak for 

91
00:05:05,911 --> 00:05:06,750
himself.

92
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:09,000
Median Kim doing it.
Don't get caught.

93
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,250
Some God that he does.

94
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,273
We don't exactly know what weapons North
Korea possesses or there's some 

95
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,840
estimates say as we mentioned in a 
previous video,

96
00:05:17,841 --> 00:05:18,674
could it's from 10 to 20 bombs.
These are unsophisticated but still 

97
00:05:21,831 --> 00:05:24,860
powerful enough to trigger a significant
crisis.

98
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:25,723
For this reason,
the United Nations Security Council has 

99
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,034
strengthened the penalty system for 
North Korea after the last underground 

100
00:05:30,681 --> 00:05:35,681
detonation in September of 2016 the 
presses even dead to speculates that the

101
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,623
might be preventative and military 
action against North Korea by the trump 

102
00:05:40,281 --> 00:05:41,480
administration.
However,

103
00:05:41,481 --> 00:05:45,140
American experts are wanting this 
military action could trigger a military

104
00:05:45,141 --> 00:05:45,974
response with wmds as well as 
conventional weaponry or war in the 

105
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:49,814
Korean peninsula would mean a human 
catastrophe and it would negatively 

106
00:05:52,551 --> 00:05:56,150
affect the world's economy.
It would most of all affected neighbors,

107
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,140
China,
south,

108
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,080
and Japan,
and the mere existence of this threat of

109
00:06:00,081 --> 00:06:00,914
war could lead to a terrifying arms race
in the region and it could even make 

110
00:06:03,531 --> 00:06:04,364
Japan take exceptional measures.
This is something we've talked about in 

111
00:06:06,741 --> 00:06:07,574
a previous video that you can see here.
That is why it's important for China to 

112
00:06:10,881 --> 00:06:13,250
end it's friendly relationship with 
North Korea.

113
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,960
It's not going to end well for China.
More overwhelmed,

114
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:21,070
general vertical non-proliferation.
Wow,

115
00:06:22,890 --> 00:06:24,510
awesome.
A vertical nonproliferation.

116
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,353
During the Cold War,
the u s and the Soviet Union developed 

117
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:32,080
more and more powerful nuclear weapons 
in greater and greater numbers.

118
00:06:32,170 --> 00:06:35,440
Each country needed to have more into 
better weapons than the other two.

119
00:06:35,441 --> 00:06:38,530
These stored thousands and thousands of 
nuclear warheads.

120
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,230
They also increased their means of 
delivering aircraft,

121
00:06:41,231 --> 00:06:45,760
missile submarines all to an extent that
had previously not even been imagined

122
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,723
during the cold war arms race.
The global nuclear stockpile peaked in 

123
00:06:53,471 --> 00:06:54,304
1986 at about 70,000
nuclear warheads according to the 

124
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:00,243
Federation of American scientists,
enough to destroy the earth several 

125
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:03,183
times.

126
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,153
Okay.

127
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:06,153
In Louisiana is the woman he tests with 
nuclear weapons conducted in the 

128
00:07:08,231 --> 00:07:09,610
atmosphere,
in the sea,

129
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:10,473
in space,
and sometimes whether intentionally or 

130
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,474
not,
they used people as Guinea pigs do 

131
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,350
analyze the effects of radioactivity in 
humans.

132
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,243
It was all a pretty terrible time.
The Japanese artist Hashimoto has 

133
00:07:21,491 --> 00:07:25,630
prepared a video where you can see the 
different nuclear tests since 1945

134
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:32,250
it looks like a video game,
but it's not.

135
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,750
Fortunately with the end of the Cold 
War,

136
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:34,584
the United States and Russia agreed to 
reduce the nuclear arsenals as well as 

137
00:07:37,771 --> 00:07:41,250
their means of delivery.
Under President Obama written April,

138
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,440
2010 the staunch treaty was signed in 
Prague.

139
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:45,810
This treaty agency limit strategic 
weapons,

140
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,703
so each country would only hold 1,500
nuclear bombs like the year 2018 but 

141
00:07:51,241 --> 00:07:52,074
still that is way too many bombers.
There are also other rules to limit 

142
00:07:55,291 --> 00:07:57,510
missiles and means of delivery and of 
course,

143
00:07:57,511 --> 00:07:58,344
no more nuclear testing is permitted.
So ctbt is a treaty which completely 

144
00:08:01,111 --> 00:08:01,944
forbids any nuclear tests and no more 
tests have been carried out since 1998 

145
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:08,100
with the exception of course being North
Korea.

146
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:08,993
Anyway,
the conclusion of all of this is that 

147
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,364
yes,
we must definitely stop the 

148
00:08:12,361 --> 00:08:16,500
proliferation of nuclear weapons in Iran
or North Korea and we sat and we have to

149
00:08:16,501 --> 00:08:20,100
prevent terrorist groups from laying 
their hands on these WMDs,

150
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:20,963
but the nuclear arsenals that still 
exist in the u s and Russia should also 

151
00:08:24,181 --> 00:08:26,250
keep reducing because among other 
things,

152
00:08:26,251 --> 00:08:27,084
the risk of misuse and lack of control 
of these weapons is waste presence in 

153
00:08:30,751 --> 00:08:34,080
the world we inhabit today and to 
dependence and globalized wars.

154
00:08:34,110 --> 00:08:36,000
They don't make any steps.
Bernard Brodie,

155
00:08:36,001 --> 00:08:39,270
the North American strategist already 
said this after World War II

156
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:41,963
thus far.
The chief purpose of our military 

157
00:08:43,081 --> 00:08:48,081
establishment has been to when Moore's 
from now on its chief purpose must be to

158
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:48,954
avert them

159
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:50,893
in the u s president John F.
Kennedy was a pioneer in the search of 

160
00:08:53,421 --> 00:08:54,980
peace and nuclear disarmament.

161
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,973
Okay.

162
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:03,660
Too many of us think it is impossible to
many think it is unreal,

163
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:07,590
but that is a dangerous your fetus 
believe.

164
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,420
It leads to the conclusion that war is 
inevitable,

165
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,943
that mankind is doomed,
that we are gripped by forces we cannot 

166
00:09:18,661 --> 00:09:19,494
control.
We need not accept that view our 

167
00:09:23,141 --> 00:09:24,570
problems,
a manmade,

168
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,570
therefore they can be solved by man

169
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,233
in a world dominated by nuclear weapons.
Kennedy's he refused to conduct any 

170
00:09:37,731 --> 00:09:38,564
nuclear tests in the atmosphere and he 
was criticized for that in his own 

171
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:41,960
country.
However,

172
00:09:41,961 --> 00:09:42,794
we could have avoided so much suffering 
and saved a huge amount of money if the 

173
00:09:45,861 --> 00:09:49,550
wells had just listened to Kennedy's 
ideas on nuclear weapons.

174
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,560
