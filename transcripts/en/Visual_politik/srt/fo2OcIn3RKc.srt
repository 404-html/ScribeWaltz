1
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:13,220
In June of 2014,
a single barrel of oil cost $114.

2
00:00:13,411 --> 00:00:14,244
Today the price is just $50.
This drop is far beyond the usual 

3
00:00:17,461 --> 00:00:21,120
fluctuations of price of this raw 
material and it's beyond the predictions

4
00:00:21,121 --> 00:00:23,730
of pessimistic defenders of the peak oil
theory,

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:24,593
the theory that we are about to have a 
severe shortage because petroleum is 

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,630
always running out more when the truth 
is that there are many different factors

7
00:00:35,161 --> 00:00:35,994
that suggest that the price of petroleum
is going to remain low for quite some 

8
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:42,090
time.
This is mainly due to two reasons.

9
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:45,540
The first is the constant improvements 
of energy efficiency,

10
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,360
meaning that we have a lesser need for 
energy.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,720
This is logical when you think that the 
group of OACD countries,

12
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:52,583
that's the world's wealthiest countries 
are using the same amounts of primary 

13
00:00:55,471 --> 00:01:00,471
energy as they used in the year 2000,
but they are producing 30 percent more.

14
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,550
For us is the biggest market with 40,000
plugin cars purchased there in the first

15
00:01:05,551 --> 00:01:06,384
six months of this year.
The second reason is innovation and 

16
00:01:08,431 --> 00:01:12,390
technological development,
a field of expertise that is inherent to

17
00:01:12,391 --> 00:01:13,224
human evolution.
This is a development that has occurred 

18
00:01:15,031 --> 00:01:15,864
on two fronts,
both fossil fuels as well as renewable 

19
00:01:18,610 --> 00:01:19,443
energies.
The best example of this might be 

20
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,433
fracking.
This is a technology that has provided 

21
00:01:24,241 --> 00:01:27,510
the wells with a large amount of oil as 
well as natural gas.

22
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,240
In fact,
this technology alone has led to the u s

23
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:33,860
doubling its oil production and it's 
currently that country is producing more

24
00:01:33,861 --> 00:01:36,660
oil than it has since the 19 seventies.
Now,

25
00:01:36,661 --> 00:01:37,494
on the other hand,
the ecological impacts of fracking is a 

26
00:01:39,541 --> 00:01:40,374
highly controversial topic that that's 
something we're going to address in a 

27
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:43,560
later video.
Now,

28
00:01:43,561 --> 00:01:44,394
the reduced price of oil has been an 
incredible sense back for Persian Gulf 

29
00:01:47,131 --> 00:01:52,131
countries where 85 percent of their 
revenue relies on this until now.

30
00:01:55,270 --> 00:01:58,510
This has allowed for the payments of all
kinds of bills.

31
00:01:58,570 --> 00:01:59,403
Citizens of got use to high levels of 
subsidies and allowances while also 

32
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:06,520
getting used to not having to pay any 
taxes to subsidize everything.

33
00:02:06,521 --> 00:02:07,840
Water,
electricity,

34
00:02:07,841 --> 00:02:09,670
fuel,
low interest loans,

35
00:02:09,700 --> 00:02:10,533
and citizens have also got used to the 
idea that they have a right to a well 

36
00:02:13,721 --> 00:02:14,820
paid civil service

37
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:15,773
job.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,873
More countries in the Persian Gulf of 
gotten used to spending an enormous 

39
00:02:23,521 --> 00:02:25,890
amounts of money on guns.
In fact,

40
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:30,210
they've spent so much money on weaponry 
that Saudi Arabia now spends more on its

41
00:02:30,211 --> 00:02:34,380
military than Russia.
This makes it the country with the third

42
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:36,700
largest military budget globally.

43
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,460
We all

44
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:47,120
know that oil money has paid for pro 
Islamic campaigns all around the world.

45
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:48,013
However,
these preexisting policies have become 

46
00:02:49,911 --> 00:02:53,180
completely unsustainable due to the drop
in the price of oil.

47
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,133
In fact,
in 2015 alone oil producing countries 

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,790
last $360,000,000,000
in oil revenues.

49
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:01,683
Yeah,

50
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:07,770
and this is all because of the harder 
drop in the price of oil.

51
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:10,980
Now I'm going get me wrong.
They do still get an enormous amounts of

52
00:03:10,981 --> 00:03:12,990
money from oil.
Saudi Arabia,

53
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,870
for example,
against around $5,500

54
00:03:15,871 --> 00:03:19,340
per capita from it's black gold mounted 
display link,

55
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:21,060
this still significant amounts of 
income.

56
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,973
They are able to maintain all of the 
subsidies that they have established 

57
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:25,883
because of this changing scenario,
all countries in the Persian Gulf are 

58
00:03:28,381 --> 00:03:32,070
announcing ambitious plans to diversify 
their economies.

59
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,933
This will allow them to get some 
distance from the economy's completely 

60
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:38,810
relying on oil they aren't looking to 
follow do by his example,

61
00:03:38,830 --> 00:03:42,690
which has been one of the only countries
do successfully transitioned away from a

62
00:03:42,691 --> 00:03:45,270
totally oil based economy in the last 40
years.

63
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:53,970
Because of this

64
00:03:53,970 --> 00:03:54,803
diversification away from the emirates 
is becoming a world leader in terms of 

65
00:03:58,321 --> 00:04:00,340
poor ism trade and the stick.

66
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,213
Tens of billions of dollars are being 
invested into Qatar with the hope that 

67
00:04:10,611 --> 00:04:11,444
it will become an economy of knowledge.
They proudly show off their education 

68
00:04:15,051 --> 00:04:18,260
city development,
a huge educational complex where some of

69
00:04:18,261 --> 00:04:21,260
the most prestigious schools in the 
wells can be found.

70
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:22,153
There are also notable researchers 
working there with budgets that seem 

71
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,690
almost infinite.
However,

72
00:04:26,710 --> 00:04:29,870
the most archetypical case is the one we
find in Saudi Arabia,

73
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:33,350
one of the world's most suffocating and 
terrifying countries.

74
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:37,340
Human Rights in Saudi Arabia are nothing
more than an illusion.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,090
Women are forced to marry under rage and
they can't even drive further.

76
00:04:41,091 --> 00:04:41,924
Dozens of executions occur every year,
and torture is quite routine lasts for 

77
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,250
me.
Homosexual acts,

78
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:48,590
trees,
treason and murder,

79
00:04:48,591 --> 00:04:53,450
a punishable by death through beheading 
and Saudi Arabia and the Islamic state.

80
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,120
Further,
the country has even banned theaters and

81
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:56,983
nightclubs in Saudi Arabia.
Religion and fundamentalism are more 

82
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,180
important than anything else.

83
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:11,650
Last economic crisis cannot be escaped 
and today they are facing a very complex

84
00:05:12,260 --> 00:05:14,180
situation.
In 2015,

85
00:05:14,181 --> 00:05:19,181
the deficit was at 15 percent of the GDP
and this continued into 2016.

86
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:20,083
This is threatening to swallow up all of
the money that they saved during the 

87
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,770
black gold of years.
Further,

88
00:05:24,771 --> 00:05:25,604
unemployment is becoming a major concern
and this is no more true than among 

89
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:29,803
young people.
The unemployment rate is currently 

90
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:34,190
sitting for young people at around 40 
percent.

91
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:37,460
This is why in April 2016,
Prince Mohammed,

92
00:05:37,461 --> 00:05:39,980
Bill Sahlman,
the strongest man in the kingdom,

93
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:44,060
announced an ambitious reform plan known
as Saudi Vision Twenty,

94
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:44,933
30.
The goal of this reform plan is nothing 

95
00:05:46,791 --> 00:05:49,400
less than do transform the country's 
economy.

96
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,571
They say,
look,

97
00:05:50,571 --> 00:05:51,404
this is a good plan.
We need to diversify our way because of 

98
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,490
necessity.
Otherwise the country will have far more

99
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:00,200
difficulties in the years to come.

100
00:06:00,250 --> 00:06:04,700
The plan aims to achieve total 
independence from oil by 20 slash 20 and

101
00:06:04,750 --> 00:06:07,840
become one of the most globally 
competitive economy is by 20,

102
00:06:07,841 --> 00:06:08,674
30.
The first step of this stance by 

103
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,223
privatizing Aramco.
This is one of the world's largest 

104
00:06:13,811 --> 00:06:17,560
companies which controls 10 percent of 
global oil production.

105
00:06:17,650 --> 00:06:18,483
The company's estimated value is five 
times that of apple with all the money 

106
00:06:22,181 --> 00:06:23,620
from them.
Privatization,

107
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,550
addition of foreign reserves of the 
privatization of public companies,

108
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:28,443
and it's real estate.
Saudi Arabia wants to generate a 

109
00:06:30,431 --> 00:06:33,100
sovereign wealth funds,
have $2,000,000,000,000

110
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,813
tell them to get a more predictable and 
stable income than they are currently 

111
00:06:42,431 --> 00:06:44,950
getting from oil.
They will see once you eliminate many of

112
00:06:44,951 --> 00:06:45,784
the subsidies that are currently 
threatening their economy and to invest 

113
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,320
in new sectors like mining,
finance,

114
00:06:50,321 --> 00:06:52,450
and importantly the military industry.

115
00:06:53,660 --> 00:06:54,493
Uber is getting a three and a half a 
billion dollar investment from Saudi 

116
00:06:58,280 --> 00:06:59,510
Arabia's public investment fund.

117
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,533
New taxes are also going to be 
introduced as another method of earning 

118
00:07:03,001 --> 00:07:03,834
for the governance.
The prince still wants to change the 

119
00:07:05,161 --> 00:07:05,994
higher educational system,
which is currently closer to the Koran 

120
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:11,250
and develop.
It's to meet modern market requirements,

121
00:07:11,310 --> 00:07:16,310
but the big question has to be,
is Saudi Arabia going to succeed?

122
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,993
It is no easy task for a country to 
quickly become an industrial power and 

123
00:07:21,481 --> 00:07:22,314
it is unlikely that tourists are going 
to be drawn to a country which sees 

124
00:07:24,961 --> 00:07:28,710
people regularly,
stones for homosexuality or adultery.

125
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:29,940
However,
all of that said,

126
00:07:29,941 --> 00:07:30,774
Saudi Arabia success will benefit the 
wells no matter how repulsive we 

127
00:07:33,751 --> 00:07:34,584
personally find that policies.
Seventy percent of the Saudi population 

128
00:07:37,591 --> 00:07:38,424
is under 30 years old and over the next 
10 years they're going to require 2 

129
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:43,583
million jobs.
We all know that when frustration 

130
00:07:45,301 --> 00:07:48,150
unemployment's ends,
religious fundamentalism add up.

131
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,240
The consequences can be truly dangerous 
to the Bonnie has proved that moderation

132
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:57,360
and capitalism can lead to changes in 
fundamentalist regimes.

133
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:01,710
We can only hope that Saudi Arabia can 
successfully follow the example that has

134
00:08:01,711 --> 00:08:02,544
been set by Dubai,
but that is our opinion here at visual 

135
00:08:04,741 --> 00:08:06,540
politic.
We want to know what you think.

136
00:08:06,541 --> 00:08:10,530
Do you think Saudi Arabia will succeed?
Do you think it will successfully follow

137
00:08:10,531 --> 00:08:11,364
the example that has been set by Dubai?
Do you think that capitalism can 

138
00:08:14,671 --> 00:08:17,640
encourage moderation in countries like 
Saudi Arabia?

139
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,160
Do you let us know your opinion in the 
comments below?

140
