1
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:10,343
The US president.
Donald Trump has an idea that he won't 

2
00:00:12,001 --> 00:00:16,380
get off on how you determined link 
continues to unleash his own world.

3
00:00:16,381 --> 00:00:17,214
War in this case,
say commercial war against the rest of 

4
00:00:19,831 --> 00:00:20,664
the world

5
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:22,730
with a bank that everybody's stealing 
from.

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:23,633
Well,
I respect China and I respect President 

7
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:28,240
Xi,
but they've been killing us,

8
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,273
convinced that the United States is 
being harmed and even Robert in its 

9
00:00:32,551 --> 00:00:34,290
trade relations.
In recent months,

10
00:00:34,291 --> 00:00:35,124
Donald Trump has launched a tough 
protectionist policy and as multiplied 

11
00:00:38,061 --> 00:00:42,960
tariffs from now on,
billions of dollars in imported products

12
00:00:42,961 --> 00:00:43,794
by the United States will have to face 
the heavy tariffs that this 

13
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,963
administration has approved is 
essentially the economic he revolutions 

14
00:00:52,321 --> 00:00:56,130
of by these American products or else 
you're not a true patriot.

15
00:00:56,131 --> 00:01:01,131
Welcome to the 1930s apparently.
The fact is that during July,

16
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:03,053
2018 new tariffs are going to come into 
effect of no less than 25% on products 

17
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:10,140
that the United States imports each year
from China,

18
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,350
which is worth about $50 billion.
By the way.

19
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:15,000
Additionally,
just a few months ago,

20
00:01:15,001 --> 00:01:18,660
the White House place tariffs on Steel 
Alemanian minium solar panels,

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,580
even washing machine imports sort.
Of course,

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,870
that is not all her at all.
Trump has already sat plans on the table

23
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,540
to implement many more tariffs really 
soon.

24
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,240
The following will be set at the end of 
August,

25
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,560
so check this out.

26
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:40,250
US unveils additional tariffs on $200 
billion more in Chinese imports.

27
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,100
It's not going to question,
have you ever played monopoly or risk?

28
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:44,963
Well,
we could see that in the eyes of the 

29
00:01:46,291 --> 00:01:47,124
American president and this whole thing 
is kind of like a board game and as he 

30
00:01:51,301 --> 00:01:52,134
is Donald Trump,
he's really not willing to lose hair 

31
00:01:54,890 --> 00:01:57,850
game.
Is Trump the game that game where you,

32
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,530
everything you ever wanted to own,
win or lose weight?

33
00:02:04,130 --> 00:02:05,580
Yeah,
I think you'll like it.

34
00:02:05,610 --> 00:02:08,160
Now we move onto the question.
Is it really going to be that simple?

35
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:08,994
Will the US presidents plans be 
fulfilled and we'll via economy be 

36
00:02:11,881 --> 00:02:12,714
strengthened by this type of policy?
These aren't really the important 

37
00:02:16,201 --> 00:02:17,034
questions here for now.
We know the Donald Trump's speech is 

38
00:02:19,081 --> 00:02:22,740
beginning to make many American 
multinationals very nervous.

39
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:24,443
I don't think this is going to get 
resolved easily and I think these 

40
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:28,770
terrorists are going to hurt the u s 
economy.

41
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:29,663
Rufus York,
Sa President of the National Foreign 

42
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:33,263
Trade Council,
which represents multinationals such as 

43
00:02:34,321 --> 00:02:35,154
Coca Cola,
Ford and Microsoft because fall from 

44
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,574
what was promised,
the first victims are the American 

45
00:02:40,771 --> 00:02:42,490
people themselves.
This an op.

46
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:49,770
Okay,

47
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:50,603
broken dreams.
The Whitehouse repeatedly insists that 

48
00:02:55,011 --> 00:02:58,250
this new policy aims to boost US 
companies.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,113
However,
before trump supporters begin to 

50
00:03:00,251 --> 00:03:01,084
celebrate.
Just hold on a second because there are 

51
00:03:02,741 --> 00:03:05,650
some things that the president is not 
taking into account.

52
00:03:09,940 --> 00:03:10,773
The first is that the vast majority of 
tariffs are being applied on 

53
00:03:13,421 --> 00:03:14,254
intermediate and capital goods.
That is goods that company important to 

54
00:03:17,411 --> 00:03:20,470
manufacture their products in the United
States.

55
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:23,680
Therefore,
one of two things is happening.

56
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:27,820
Either you pay the tariff or you start 
buying in other markets,

57
00:03:27,850 --> 00:03:31,240
even assuming that it's possible in the 
United States itself.

58
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:32,133
In any case,
this implies a higher cost of 

59
00:03:33,611 --> 00:03:34,444
production,
which evidently reduces US companies 

60
00:03:36,281 --> 00:03:37,114
competitive.
Now,

61
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:40,410
this is,
for example,

62
00:03:40,411 --> 00:03:41,244
the case of midcontinent nail that a 
Missouri company that is the largest 

63
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:45,804
producer of nails in the United States.
After trump approved tariffs on foreign 

64
00:03:49,561 --> 00:03:50,394
steel,
they had to lay off 60 of their 500 

65
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:55,160
employees and everything points to it 
being forced.

66
00:03:55,161 --> 00:03:58,740
You close or transfer its entire 
production to Mexico.

67
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,763
This is a company that works,
is a company that created employment 

68
00:04:03,811 --> 00:04:07,100
that was the competitive in the free 
market and that now do you have to,

69
00:04:07,101 --> 00:04:09,510
Washington's interference is falling 
apart.

70
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:12,030
Then the second issue,
which I'm sure won't surprise any of you

71
00:04:12,031 --> 00:04:12,864
peers that other countries,
I'm not just going to simply accepts 

72
00:04:15,451 --> 00:04:16,850
these tariffs and be like,
ah,

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:21,030
it's cool.
In order to defend the core interests of

74
00:04:21,031 --> 00:04:22,890
the country and the interests of the 
people,

75
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:26,910
we are forced to retaliate statement of 
the Chinese Ministry of Commerce,

76
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:28,733
the European Union,
Canada and Mexico said that they will 

77
00:04:31,291 --> 00:04:32,124
respond to new US tariffs on steel.
Linda aluminum with punitive measures 

78
00:04:36,091 --> 00:04:39,330
targeting American products worth 
billions of dollars.

79
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,253
These other countries,
they going to react and they're 

80
00:04:42,271 --> 00:04:43,860
basically going to say,
guys,

81
00:04:43,861 --> 00:04:45,380
if you're going to set tariffs,
uh,

82
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,413
we're going to get on that too.
And this is something that just goes on 

83
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:50,100
and on and it really shouldn't be like 
that,

84
00:04:50,101 --> 00:04:52,800
but it's simply is.
And really the consequences.

85
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,510
They don't take a long time to arrive.

86
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:01,863
Holly Davidson,
the popular motorcycle manufacturer and 

87
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,160
one of the great icons in the U S and 
check it out,

88
00:05:06,161 --> 00:05:06,994
trump himself is actually a fan,
has now announced that it will transfer 

89
00:05:09,911 --> 00:05:10,744
parts of its production from its US 
factories to new factories located in 

90
00:05:14,591 --> 00:05:15,424
Europe.

91
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:17,860
Okay.

92
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:18,693
You see,
when trump punish the European Union 

93
00:05:20,561 --> 00:05:21,394
with tariffs on steel and Alan Minium,
they responded with more tariffs of 

94
00:05:24,701 --> 00:05:25,720
their own.
For example,

95
00:05:25,810 --> 00:05:28,930
they increased the tariff on imports of 
motorcycles,

96
00:05:28,931 --> 00:05:33,931
manufacturers in the United States from 
6% to 31% so,

97
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,070
well,
what does this all mean?

98
00:05:36,130 --> 00:05:36,911
Well,
on average,

99
00:05:36,911 --> 00:05:40,740
that means about $2,200
extra for every motorcycle.

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,713
Some of it suggesting we should protect 
American companies from foreign 

101
00:05:44,241 --> 00:05:45,074
competition.
I don't believe the American people are 

102
00:05:46,731 --> 00:05:49,880
afraid of competition.
That was made clear to me when I visited

103
00:05:49,881 --> 00:05:50,714
a Harley Davidson plant recently.
When you hear talk about a tough trade 

104
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:54,194
bill,
remember that being tough on trade and 

105
00:05:55,851 --> 00:05:58,070
commerce,
the of the economy,

106
00:05:58,130 --> 00:06:01,880
one of the worst possible consequences 
for the consumer and the American worker

107
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:04,250
as I told them at the Harley Davidson 
plant,

108
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:07,580
it's time to gum.
The engine's not put on the brakes.

109
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:08,573
This is a cost which evidently European 
motorcycle manufacturers such as BMW do 

110
00:06:12,511 --> 00:06:13,344
not have to face and thanks to a 
commercial agreements between the 

111
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,950
European Union and Japan.
Neither will a Yamaha Kawasaki or Honda,

112
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,010
which are by the way,
Harley Davidson's main competitors.

113
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:31,830
This is further proof of the harm from 
unilateral tariffs.

114
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,590
The best way to help American workers,
consumers,

115
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:37,380
and manufacturers is to open new markets
for them,

116
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:38,333
not to raise barriers to our own market.
Ashley Strong a spokeswoman for House 

117
00:06:42,181 --> 00:06:43,350
Speaker Paul Ryan,

118
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:47,390
and as you might imagine taking donald 
trump's character ncu accounts.

119
00:06:47,430 --> 00:06:52,430
This news made him angry and the even 
threatens the company itself by twitter.

120
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:53,973
Of course,

121
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,763
leave Davidson.
It should never be built in another 

122
00:06:57,421 --> 00:06:58,380
country.
Never.

123
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:01,140
Their employees and customers are 
already very angry at them.

124
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,610
If they move,
watch,

125
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:05,010
it will be the beginning of the end.
They surrendered,

126
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:05,903
they quit.
The aura will be gone and they will be 

127
00:07:07,501 --> 00:07:09,300
taxed like never before.

128
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:10,273
President of the threatening and 
damaging the image of a large American 

129
00:07:12,381 --> 00:07:13,214
companies simply for making business 
decisions that could save them from 

130
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:20,300
massive losses is completely bizarre,
but I suppose welcome to trump's America

131
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,193
now.
I suppose the question we could ask is 

132
00:07:22,461 --> 00:07:26,510
does that motorcycle company really 
needs to transfer part of its production

133
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:27,403
over to Europe?

134
00:07:35,570 --> 00:07:38,150
Harley Davidson need to look to the 
world.

135
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,320
Yeah.

136
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,153
American companies have enough 
challenges and problems to overcome as 

137
00:07:42,411 --> 00:07:46,970
it is without us having to deal with 
interference and nonsense from the White

138
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:47,390
House.
You see,

139
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:48,223
trump's trade war has had a strong 
impacts on companies like Harley 

140
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,303
Davidson.
Their costs have increased due to steal 

141
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,073
and Alan minium tariffs since,
but this means that the motorcycle 

142
00:07:55,971 --> 00:07:59,000
company is spending 20 million more 
dollars every year,

143
00:07:59,030 --> 00:07:59,863
and if that wasn't enough,
American multinationals are starting to 

144
00:08:02,241 --> 00:08:04,560
see the risk of them.
Market's closing.

145
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:05,960
Okay.

146
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,530
Creasing international production to 
alleviate the EU tariffs burden.

147
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:10,433
He's not the company's preference,
but represents the only sustainable 

148
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:17,270
option to make.
It's motorcycles accessible to customers

149
00:08:17,271 --> 00:08:20,270
in the EU and maintain a viable business
in Europe.

150
00:08:20,330 --> 00:08:24,320
Europe is a critical market for Harley 
Davidson statement by Harley Davidson

151
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:28,120
because of this crisis has hard to the 
motorcycle company at a time when it was

152
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:29,640
already pretty weak.
Checkout,

153
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,690
for example,
I'm its stock price has evolved over the

154
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:36,691
last four years.
Why did this happen?

155
00:08:45,090 --> 00:08:50,090
Why did they see a huge 40% drop in 
years when the US stock market has risen

156
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:51,173
like a rocket?
While the main explanation there via is 

157
00:08:53,941 --> 00:08:57,060
that times are changing was a time when 
these big bikes,

158
00:08:57,061 --> 00:08:58,530
these huge,
powerful,

159
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,430
noisy beast sweat something of a dream 
for many Americans.

160
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,700
However,
due to the price,

161
00:09:05,730 --> 00:09:07,980
they are very expensive and changing 
tastes.

162
00:09:07,981 --> 00:09:11,400
Today's generations aren't as attracted 
to this type of motorcycle.

163
00:09:11,430 --> 00:09:12,263
In fact,
the average age of holly earners in the 

164
00:09:13,801 --> 00:09:18,801
United States today is over 50 and 
Zillow vis,

165
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,153
as you can imagine,
translates into the number of sales at 

166
00:09:22,411 --> 00:09:23,244
the company I'm making.
And therefore their profits in the last 

167
00:09:25,351 --> 00:09:26,184
three years alone,
the company's sales have decreased by 

168
00:09:27,571 --> 00:09:28,404
10% of profits of full length,
almost 40% and in 2018 things are even 

169
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,253
worse.

170
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,963
Just a viewer is why this company,
they need to look abroad both to Europe 

171
00:09:40,301 --> 00:09:41,134
and Asia.
Because if there is no commercial 

172
00:09:42,521 --> 00:09:44,440
freedom and there are tariffs 
production,

173
00:09:44,590 --> 00:09:45,423
it just has to go to other places 
because no Harley Davidson's decisions 

174
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:55,990
got nothing to do with politics.
And of course it's not a betrayal.

175
00:09:56,020 --> 00:09:56,853
It's simply an economic and 
understandably logical decision made by 

176
00:10:00,131 --> 00:10:03,850
a company that simply has to compete.
Something by the way,

177
00:10:03,851 --> 00:10:04,684
isn't easy now that they have to face 
the consequences of the commercial war 

178
00:10:07,211 --> 00:10:09,490
that Washington has unleashed.
You know what?

179
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:12,160
This is not an isolated case.
Listen to this

180
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,970
multinationals,
drums,

181
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:23,620
lessees,
hom,

182
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:27,090
American companies,
and by extension the American economy.

183
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,010
And of course the further of the war 
goes,

184
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:30,780
the greater the consequences will be.

185
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:31,773
Okay.

186
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:33,933
The moments American multinationals,
some of whipped supported trump park 

187
00:10:36,451 --> 00:10:39,120
getting very,
very nervous about this whole thing.

188
00:10:39,150 --> 00:10:39,983
General Motors itself has said that if 
the president finally approves tariffs 

189
00:10:42,601 --> 00:10:43,434
on vehicle importations,
it's something that the White House 

190
00:10:45,031 --> 00:10:45,864
raised recently.
The consequences would be less 

191
00:10:47,761 --> 00:10:48,594
investment,
that fewer jobs and fewer wages for 

192
00:10:50,071 --> 00:10:52,470
General Motors workers in the United 
States.

193
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:55,170
Take for example,
the case of another us icon,

194
00:10:55,171 --> 00:10:56,004
the Ford Mustang,
which of course is assembled in the 

195
00:10:57,661 --> 00:11:00,450
United States and exported from there to
the rest of it.

196
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:01,284
Yeah.
Well about 48% of the mustangs 

197
00:11:09,241 --> 00:11:11,790
components come from outside of the 
United States,

198
00:11:11,791 --> 00:11:14,400
so if those import south punished with 
tariffs,

199
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:19,170
the result is a more expensive car,
both for American consumers as well as,

200
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,660
so we only have two

201
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:26,753
American Aniko Ford mustangs and Harley 
Davidson's being negatively affected by 

202
00:11:30,391 --> 00:11:32,370
trump's policies.
It's not a good thing,

203
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:37,490
right?
America first America first,

204
00:11:38,050 --> 00:11:41,140
and companies from other countries that 
have factories in the United States such

205
00:11:41,141 --> 00:11:43,690
as Toyota for your Chrysler,
Daimler and BMW.

206
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:48,670
A warning of the dangers of this war.
Mercedes Benz parent company.

207
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:53,380
Daimler warned that dueling tariffs 
between the United States and China will

208
00:11:53,381 --> 00:11:57,880
hit its earnings.
Specifically for SUV is made in Alabama,

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,700
but this isn't only effecting the 
automotive industry,

210
00:12:00,701 --> 00:12:01,534
it's virtually all sectors because yes,
it's true that the United States is the 

211
00:12:05,591 --> 00:12:09,650
largest economy on the planet has,
but do not forget that 85% of its GDP in

212
00:12:09,651 --> 00:12:12,400
most of its growth happens outside its 
borders.

213
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,650
Closing up,
it's simply bad for business.

214
00:12:19,420 --> 00:12:20,253
Knitting barriers goes precisely against
the interests of a country that has 

215
00:12:23,081 --> 00:12:23,914
currently got a lot of employment,
is hitting record numbers in terms of 

216
00:12:26,471 --> 00:12:30,400
workers and has the largest industrial 
production and its history.

217
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,263
Yeah,
I know Donald Trump talks a lot about 

218
00:12:32,711 --> 00:12:35,710
the trade deficits and yes,
there really is one,

219
00:12:35,711 --> 00:12:38,470
but that's not for the reason that the 
president's states,

220
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,333
you see the United States,
it doesn't have a trade deficit because 

221
00:12:41,830 --> 00:12:43,510
it's being robust,
not at all.

222
00:12:43,511 --> 00:12:44,344
In fact,
it's simply got it because this is an 

223
00:12:45,251 --> 00:12:47,890
economy that consumes more than it 
produces.

224
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:50,080
If Donald Trump wants to reduce the 
deficits,

225
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,190
he can't.
For example,

226
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:54,910
stop the immense public spending that is
causing so many problems.

227
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:55,773
As we saw in this previous video,
you can also promote savings and 

228
00:12:58,570 --> 00:12:59,403
investments,
so the companies are more productive 

229
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:02,800
among many,
many other things.

230
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,693
And the overall reality is,
is that this trade war is kind of bad 

231
00:13:06,341 --> 00:13:08,590
for everyone,
but now it's your turn.

232
00:13:08,710 --> 00:13:11,290
What do you think about the trade war?
Do you support it d and not?
