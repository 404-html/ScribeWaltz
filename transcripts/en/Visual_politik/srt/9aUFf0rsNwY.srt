1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,420
Does the United States need to launch a 
commercial wharf?

2
00:00:03,450 --> 00:00:04,283
Is the US economy in danger due to the 
high trade deficit that they carry with 

3
00:00:07,741 --> 00:00:11,970
them each and every year?
It's China competing in an unfair way,

4
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:15,450
and how can Donald Trump defend the 
United States?

5
00:00:24,260 --> 00:00:26,540
Hey,
I'm not saying they're stupid.

6
00:00:26,870 --> 00:00:29,510
I like China.
I sell apartments for 10.

7
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:30,383
I just sold an apartment for $15,000,000
to somebody from China am I supposed to 

8
00:00:34,791 --> 00:00:35,624
dislike,
but we can continuously have other 

9
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:41,870
nations taking advantage of the United 
States like never before.

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:44,840
The biggest bank in the world is from 
China.

11
00:00:45,080 --> 00:00:45,913
For many years,
no president wanted to go against China 

12
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,350
economically and we're going to do it 
because we can't continue to allow China

13
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,140
to rape our country and that's what 
they're doing.

14
00:01:00,260 --> 00:01:03,770
In particular with China,
we're going to be doing a section three.

15
00:01:03,771 --> 00:01:04,920
Oh,
one trade action.

16
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:06,013
It could be about $60,000,000,000,
but that's really just a fraction of 

17
00:01:10,011 --> 00:01:11,030
what we're talking about.

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,560
Dear viewer intentions are certainly one
thing and results.

19
00:01:14,561 --> 00:01:16,240
Well,
that's entirely another.

20
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:20,680
That's precisely what almost always 
happens with protectionist policies.

21
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,573
That ranger to doing one thing,
but they end up doing something totally 

22
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,204
different.
Donald trump was very clear about this 

23
00:01:27,340 --> 00:01:28,173
during the election campaign that led 
him to the White House and he has 

24
00:01:30,791 --> 00:01:34,390
continued to be justice clear since he's
arrived in the Oval Office.

25
00:01:34,391 --> 00:01:38,050
Protectionist policies are a fantastic 
idea.

26
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:38,933
I want

27
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:42,640
those companies and they're starting.
I want them back here.

28
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:43,923
I want them back here.
They're going to come back here to 

29
00:01:46,900 --> 00:01:47,230
trump.

30
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:50,860
Signed new tariffs on steel and aluminum
into law.

31
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:52,593
Trump moves to crack down on China trade
with $60 million in tariffs on imported 

32
00:01:56,741 --> 00:01:59,480
products.
Trump proposes $100,

33
00:01:59,481 --> 00:02:02,230
billion dollars in additional tariffs on
Chinese products.

34
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:03,093
So far,
only the first terrorist have been 

35
00:02:04,481 --> 00:02:07,290
approved such as those on steel and as 
an alum,

36
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:11,040
and it excludes many us allied countries

37
00:02:11,070 --> 00:02:16,070
so that steel and aluminum,
your country is not the same.

38
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:18,180
That's according to the news.
Trump is very,

39
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,014
very clear about one thing and that one 
of his main priorities is fighting the 

40
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:23,244
external deficits.
That is reducing the difference between 

41
00:02:25,981 --> 00:02:26,814
imports and exports.
This is a difference of over 

42
00:02:28,951 --> 00:02:32,310
$500,000,000,000
every.

43
00:02:32,630 --> 00:02:33,463
Yeah,

44
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:40,760
and that is where terrorists boys come 
into play.

45
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:43,160
It goes something like this,
so my people,

46
00:02:43,210 --> 00:02:45,440
they want to buy foreign products.
Fine.

47
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,370
Terrorists will teach them about that.
All right.

48
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,141
All right,
hold on.

49
00:02:48,141 --> 00:02:49,340
Let's.
Let's be fair.

50
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,013
Many argue that trump doesn't really 
want to get involved in a full blown 

51
00:02:58,231 --> 00:02:59,180
commercial.
Warren,

52
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:00,053
theU ,
s presidents threats especially against 

53
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:02,403
China.
Nothing more than a gamble to force Xi 

54
00:03:04,670 --> 00:03:09,670
Jinping's governments into sitting and 
negotiate and yeah,

55
00:03:11,971 --> 00:03:12,804
that might be saved,
but since one never really knows with 

56
00:03:15,061 --> 00:03:17,220
trump just in case and to clear things 
up,

57
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:21,300
I think we need to ask ourselves a few 
important questions.

58
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:25,720
Does it help the United States open fire
and trigger a trade war tariffs?

59
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:29,850
Really the best way to help the US 
economy is China breaking the rules.

60
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,480
Are they competing in an unfair way and 
do we need to punish,

61
00:03:33,481 --> 00:03:34,950
but using.
Well,

62
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:35,940
let's see.
Wall Street

63
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:36,903
took a hit today.
The new news of the terrorists from 

64
00:03:39,061 --> 00:03:43,080
China took it pretty hard.
China's Ministry of Commerce as it is,

65
00:03:43,081 --> 00:03:46,530
imposing tariffs on 128 American 
products sold in China.

66
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:49,260
China announced a 15 percent tariff on 
us,

67
00:03:49,261 --> 00:03:51,120
fruit wines,
steel pipes,

68
00:03:51,121 --> 00:03:51,954
and other products.
This is in response to trump 

69
00:03:53,131 --> 00:03:53,964
administration tariffs on aluminum and 
steel imports from China and other 

70
00:03:56,641 --> 00:03:57,474
countries.

71
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Bad Plan for nonexistent.
Here is a question,

72
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:08,043
what does a politician want when he puts
protectionist policies on the table and 

73
00:04:11,211 --> 00:04:11,381
no,
no,

74
00:04:11,381 --> 00:04:12,214
no,
I know what you're thinking and I'm not 

75
00:04:13,121 --> 00:04:15,370
going to accept a winning votes as a 
valid answer.

76
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:15,851
Yeah,
so look,

77
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:19,210
I know winning votes is every 
politician's number one priority,

78
00:04:19,211 --> 00:04:21,640
but for that very reason that's not 
sheet.

79
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,930
Let's focus on the specifics of 
protectionist policies.

80
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,880
Well,
I think we could say that the objectives

81
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,670
are usually this defending industrial 
jobs,

82
00:04:30,730 --> 00:04:35,050
punishing alleged unfair competition,
usually by poorer countries and boosting

83
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,250
the local economy.

84
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:38,293
Right?

85
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:47,720
Are those are the intentions,
but what are the results?

86
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:50,480
If the United States starts a trade war 
with China,

87
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:53,000
is it going to achieve those objectives?
Well,

88
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:55,820
let's have a look at this step by step.
First of all,

89
00:04:55,850 --> 00:04:58,340
this is what Donald Trump has to say on 
the matter.

90
00:04:58,910 --> 00:04:59,743
Under my administration,
the theft of American prosperity will 

91
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:04,420
end.
We're going to defend our industry,

92
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,920
create a level playing field for the 
American worker,

93
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:08,630
Donald J dot trump.
Wow.

94
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:12,480
Thank goodness that politicians are here
to defend the American,

95
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:13,430
be both.
By the way,

96
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:17,870
this is absolutely the same excuse he 
uses to prosecute immigration,

97
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:18,733
defending that American worker,
but there is only one problem and to be 

98
00:05:22,581 --> 00:05:23,414
fair is very big problem and that is 
that the statistics show a completely 

99
00:05:26,511 --> 00:05:27,344
different situation.
You see the US labor market is 

100
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:37,030
undergoing one of the best moments in 
almost two decades.

101
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:37,864
The unemployment rate is at about four 
percent and the number of unfilled 

102
00:05:40,511 --> 00:05:45,511
vacancies is growing enormously.
Indeed,

103
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:46,993
the American economic machine is 
actually beginning to suffer shortages 

104
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:52,070
of one of its most important inputs and 
that's of course

105
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:55,090
if migration

106
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:58,010
policies do not change in the economy 
doesn't collapse.

107
00:05:58,011 --> 00:05:58,844
Of course,
it is estimated that in the next 10 

108
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:05,021
years the United States will have more 
than 8 million jobs to be filled,

109
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:18,870
and this is actually happening quite 
intensely in the Midwest.

110
00:06:18,871 --> 00:06:22,020
Instincts like Wisconsin where there's a
lot of employment,

111
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:22,913
but very few workers.
It's great to have more people working 

112
00:06:25,801 --> 00:06:28,410
in Wisconsin than ever before,
but it creates a challenge.

113
00:06:28,470 --> 00:06:31,830
We just essentially need more people.
Trisha Brown,

114
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:32,783
chief operating officer for the 
Wisconsin Economic Development 

115
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:38,240
Corporation right now.
Unemployment rates in those states,

116
00:06:38,241 --> 00:06:42,150
it below three percent and the new jobs 
are constantly emerging.

117
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,170
For example,
the Taiwanese technology group,

118
00:06:46,171 --> 00:06:48,690
Foxconn,
is investing more than $10,000,000,000

119
00:06:48,691 --> 00:06:50,670
in a gigantic campus.
Do developments,

120
00:06:50,671 --> 00:06:52,290
produced new smartphones,
tablets,

121
00:06:52,291 --> 00:06:55,770
and television screens.
It's going to employ more than 13,000

122
00:06:55,771 --> 00:06:56,604
people.
The situation is so peculiar that state 

123
00:07:00,541 --> 00:07:03,360
authorities have been forced to launch 
an advertising campaign,

124
00:07:03,361 --> 00:07:04,194
for example,
on trains in Chicago and indeed here on 

125
00:07:06,151 --> 00:07:09,330
Youtube in order to attract workers to 
the state,

126
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,193
but not only that you seek.
The truth is that the manufacturing 

127
00:07:12,961 --> 00:07:16,890
industry now employs a lot fewer people 
than it did two decades ago,

128
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:20,190
but do you think this is actually due to
Chinese competition?

129
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,043
Yeah.

130
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:22,983
Well,
the reality is the numbers tell quite a 

131
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,444
different story.
Not only his employment at its highest 

132
00:07:27,431 --> 00:07:28,264
levels in US economic history,
industrial production has also reached 

133
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:34,120
its highest levels.
Yes,

134
00:07:34,150 --> 00:07:34,983
the industry has fewer people,
but that doesn't mean it produces any 

135
00:07:37,901 --> 00:07:40,300
less.
What's happening is the factories thanks

136
00:07:40,301 --> 00:07:43,960
to robots and technology are becoming 
increasingly productive.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:48,733
So,
uh,

138
00:07:48,740 --> 00:07:51,830
how about an example of this?
Let's take a look at the steel industry,

139
00:07:51,831 --> 00:07:55,010
which trump said is being threatened by 
Chinese competition.

140
00:07:55,070 --> 00:07:55,903
Indeed,
his stated that this poses a danger to 

141
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,820
national security.
Well,

142
00:07:58,850 --> 00:07:59,683
the truth is that the US produces 70 
percent of the steel it consumes for 

143
00:08:02,931 --> 00:08:06,830
which only three percent is actually 
intended for military use.

144
00:08:06,831 --> 00:08:09,980
So him saying national security leads me
to the reply,

145
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:12,620
rarely ends on top of that.
China,

146
00:08:12,650 --> 00:08:17,650
it's not even in the top 10 suppliers.
Yeah.

147
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:18,583
Employment in the steel industry has 
decreased to almost half in the last 10 

148
00:08:21,891 --> 00:08:22,641
years.
But folks,

149
00:08:22,641 --> 00:08:26,720
the vast majority of jobs aren't lost 
due to China or international trade,

150
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:30,410
but simply due to technology and look a 
commercial war.

151
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:33,650
It's not gonna change that spots,
as you can probably see,

152
00:08:33,651 --> 00:08:37,310
this isn't precisely bad nowadays in the
United States,

153
00:08:37,311 --> 00:08:40,010
there are more jobs than ever.
And the trade deficits,

154
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:42,380
well,
despite what trump might say,

155
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:46,550
isn't really that high.
Being less than three percent of the GDP

156
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:49,700
and in fact it has decreased 
considerably in recent years.

157
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:50,583
Yes.

158
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,970
We're all saying ready for getting some 
other important details.

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,740
Like for example the investments.
You heard that right?

160
00:09:04,741 --> 00:09:08,400
The United States has a positive net 
investment balance.

161
00:09:08,401 --> 00:09:12,750
That is foreigners invest more in the 
United States than Americans do abroad,

162
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:16,980
which is obviously very good for the US 
economy's future in 2017.

163
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,300
This positive balance surpassed 
$250,000,000,000.

164
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,540
Anything that's all.
Well you are very,

165
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,673
very wrong.
Now we've don't know if a commercial 

166
00:09:30,991 --> 00:09:33,510
wall would decrease the external 
deficits,

167
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,260
but it would have other not exactly 
desirable consequences,

168
00:09:37,261 --> 00:09:38,910
so well,
listen up to this

169
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:46,950
consequences.

170
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,440
Let me say it loud and let me say a 
clear.

171
00:09:52,441 --> 00:09:53,274
The ones who'd be most effected by a 
trade war against Chinese imports would 

172
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,190
be u s companies.
Yes.

173
00:09:59,191 --> 00:10:01,020
You had that rise.
I did not screw it up.

174
00:10:01,021 --> 00:10:01,854
Buying cheaper materials abroad 
decreases production costs for local 

175
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:07,760
industries,
and if in addition,

176
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:10,710
a foreign country in this case trying to
sell it below cost,

177
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:15,150
it'd been like Beijing was subsidizing 
American Industries at this point.

178
00:10:15,151 --> 00:10:15,811
You might be thinking,
well,

179
00:10:15,811 --> 00:10:18,630
this sounds really good about,
is it actually right?

180
00:10:18,690 --> 00:10:20,370
Well,
take a look at this

181
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:21,870
now.

182
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,703
We need to bear in mind that the United 
States not only important products to 

183
00:10:26,101 --> 00:10:26,934
consume from China,
they also important many intermediate 

184
00:10:29,521 --> 00:10:31,650
goods and capital goods such as 
machinery.

185
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,100
In fact,
more than half of all imports from China

186
00:10:35,101 --> 00:10:37,380
corresponds to this type of product.

187
00:10:39,790 --> 00:10:40,380
Sorry,

188
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:41,213
now comes an essential question.
What with the terrorists actually 

189
00:10:45,690 --> 00:10:46,830
achieve?
Well,

190
00:10:46,890 --> 00:10:47,723
it's precisely that it would damage 
American companies competitive now it 

191
00:10:53,961 --> 00:10:54,794
would increase the cost of producing 
much more advanced goods and aspects in 

192
00:10:57,831 --> 00:11:00,380
which the North American industry is 
currently a leader.

193
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,243
This would mean decreasing their exports
to the rest of the world as well as the 

194
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:07,910
consumption capacity of Americans 
themselves and the results of this well,

195
00:11:07,911 --> 00:11:10,640
that's millions of jobs being destroyed,

196
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:11,493
right?

197
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:14,243
Example of the new tariff on steel and 
aluminium will make production in the 

198
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,433
United States of things.
They use steel and minium like cars and 

199
00:11:21,241 --> 00:11:24,930
airplanes more expensive and therefore 
less competitive.

200
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:28,903
Will new tariffs have to be set on cars 
in order to offset this hire local 

201
00:11:32,391 --> 00:11:33,224
production costs.
And this explains why when in 2000 and 

202
00:11:37,811 --> 00:11:38,644
to President George W Bush impose 
tariffs on imported steel to the toll 

203
00:11:41,890 --> 00:11:45,730
was the destruction of 200,000
jobs.

204
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,790
This was a clear backfire if the 
intended.

205
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:51,450
I see.
Yup.

206
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,880
That is another really detail.
Yeah.

207
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:54,783
When you sat terrorists,
the usual reaction is for the other 

208
00:11:56,471 --> 00:11:57,304
posse to defend itself.
I'm not saying it's the right thing to 

209
00:11:59,351 --> 00:12:01,120
do,
but it does happen.

210
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:05,440
The United States announces an 
additional $100,000,000,000

211
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,363
list of tariffs.
China has already fully prepared and 

212
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:12,130
will not hesitate to immediately make a 
fierce counter straight golfing.

213
00:12:12,190 --> 00:12:14,490
China's commerce ministry spokesman.
Alright,

214
00:12:14,530 --> 00:12:15,363
so let us use the example of Boeing.
China is the largest market today for 

215
00:12:20,321 --> 00:12:21,154
this company and in the next few years 
it's going to deliver hundreds of new 

216
00:12:23,621 --> 00:12:25,120
aircrafts to China.
Well,

217
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:26,003
it commercial wart would absolutely 
damaged their longterm competitive 

218
00:12:29,171 --> 00:12:34,171
position,
for example,

219
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:35,653
other companies such as Abas and 
accelerate the development of a local 

220
00:12:38,331 --> 00:12:39,350
industry.
Yes,

221
00:12:39,351 --> 00:12:42,050
it does seem difficult today,
but in the longterm,

222
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:47,080
the consequences could be absolutely 
gigantic and that's not even to say that

223
00:12:51,151 --> 00:12:53,850
China could results the other less 
orthodox means.

224
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:54,713
For example,
let us not forget that China is the 

225
00:12:56,131 --> 00:12:58,920
largest foreign desk for the United 
States.

226
00:12:58,950 --> 00:12:59,783
Would it be good for Washington if China
stopped buying data or if they began 

227
00:13:02,911 --> 00:13:05,630
decreasing securities in order to incite
pressure?

228
00:13:05,670 --> 00:13:07,080
Well,
these are pretty obvious questions.

229
00:13:07,081 --> 00:13:07,914
The answer is definitely no.
This is especially due to the huge 

230
00:13:11,221 --> 00:13:14,490
public deficit that the current 
administration is fueling,

231
00:13:14,520 --> 00:13:19,520
but wait just a moment because there is 
something that trump is absolutely right

232
00:13:19,621 --> 00:13:20,454
about,

233
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:30,610
is trying to breaking the rules.
Trump has one thing,

234
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:35,640
right?
China isn't precisely a free market or a

235
00:13:35,641 --> 00:13:36,474
country that plays well with others and 
it isn't just about the fact that they 

236
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:42,330
have high tariffs or that they favor 
local companies.

237
00:13:42,331 --> 00:13:45,270
They're all of them is for example,
a lack mailing.

238
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,330
Large multinational.
For example,

239
00:13:49,331 --> 00:13:51,490
if foreign companies want to sell freely
in China,

240
00:13:51,491 --> 00:13:52,324
they have to ally with local partners,
partners who can access that technology 

241
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,890
and Oh yes,
this technology transfer is a problem in

242
00:13:59,891 --> 00:14:01,990
some ways because these Chinese 
companies,

243
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,350
than use this technology to grow and 
compete.

244
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:08,393
However technological companies know 
what they're getting themselves into 

245
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:11,923
when they access the Chinese market,
it has to be them who decided where to 

246
00:14:15,291 --> 00:14:16,460
produce,
how to compete,

247
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:18,310
and to what businesses to get involved 
in.

248
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,800
Of course,
this doesn't mean that the US government

249
00:14:22,801 --> 00:14:25,230
should have pressure or negotiate with 
China,

250
00:14:25,290 --> 00:14:29,490
but unleashing a commercial,
what would be a terribly bad solution,

251
00:14:29,520 --> 00:14:31,350
so listen,
as long as it's just threats,

252
00:14:31,351 --> 00:14:32,970
the US,
they're going to be all right,

253
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,850
but they have to be careful not to cross
the light.

254
00:14:35,851 --> 00:14:39,330
This is how a big crisis would start.
Fortunately,

255
00:14:39,331 --> 00:14:40,164
unless trump insists,
it really looks like this isn't gonna 

256
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,283
happen.
China initiate WTO dispute complaint 

257
00:14:46,381 --> 00:14:49,110
against us tariffs on steel and aluminum
products.

258
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:53,030
President Xi Jinping announces plans to 
open up China's economy,

259
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:53,983
including lowering tariffs for autos and
enforcing the legal intellectual 

260
00:14:56,991 --> 00:14:58,820
property of foreign firms.
Now,

261
00:14:58,821 --> 00:14:59,654
having said all of this,
let's just wait a moment because there 

262
00:15:01,731 --> 00:15:02,564
is still a question on the table and 
that's how can the United States reduce 

263
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,940
its trade deficits?
Well,

264
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:11,060
the best way to achieve this is with 
bets with structural policies,

265
00:15:11,061 --> 00:15:14,140
doing what great exporting powers like 
Germany and Switzerland,

266
00:15:14,141 --> 00:15:18,230
it favorite saving and therefore 
longterm productive investment decreases

267
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,740
the public deficit which boosts import 
consumption bike overheating.

268
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:25,700
The economy improves the competitiveness
of local businesses

269
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:32,680
since reducing bureaucracy,
favoring talents attraction,

270
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:33,573
yes,
immigration and lowering taxes as the 

271
00:15:36,580 --> 00:15:37,720
last fiscal reform of the Republican 
Party did,

272
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:40,180
which we talked about in a previous 
video.

273
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,390
Those are the paths that should be taken
while they commercial war.

274
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:44,980
That's going to be just bad for 
everyone,

275
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:48,070
as in any case,
external deficit doesn't have to be bad.

276
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,440
It all depends on how much the economy 
grows,

277
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:53,890
what it is used for,
or what happens with the investments.

278
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,060
Well,
now over to you,

279
00:15:55,090 --> 00:15:58,060
do you favor setting tariffs on China?
Well,

280
00:15:58,061 --> 00:15:58,894
let us know your answer in the comments

but we're not mine and as always,
thank you for watching.

287
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:16,783
Wall Street took a hit today.
The new news that the terrorists from 

288
00:16:19,491 --> 00:16:23,480
China took it pretty hard.
China's Ministry of Commerce as it is,

289
00:16:23,481 --> 00:16:26,900
imposing tariffs on 128 American 
products sold in China.
