1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,120
[inaudible]

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,410
Spain is known as who?
Your Iglesias,

3
00:00:09,411 --> 00:00:10,244
this country,
the land of the Flamenco and high 

4
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:12,884
unemployment rates.
Even now when all of Europe is emerging 

5
00:00:15,261 --> 00:00:16,094
from the crisis,
this country maintains a higher 

6
00:00:17,961 --> 00:00:22,010
unemployment rate than Iraq or Albania.
In other words,

7
00:00:22,011 --> 00:00:27,011
Spain isn't exactly a role model as far 
as economics is consent.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:30,710
However,
there's a region that doesn't fit at all

9
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,740
in this category.
Yes,

10
00:00:35,801 --> 00:00:38,310
Divya,
we all talking about the basket country,

11
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,010
also known as a use Katie along with 
Nevada.

12
00:00:41,011 --> 00:00:45,000
These are two of the richest stands,
most prosperous regions in the entire of

13
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:45,834
Spain,
both of the Basque country and the Vara 

14
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,670
usually at the top of every indicator,
far above,

15
00:00:50,671 --> 00:00:52,050
by the way,
Catalonia.

16
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:53,003
In other words,
we could say that these two regions are 

17
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:56,543
something like a small Germany within 
Spain with an entirely different 

18
00:01:00,091 --> 00:01:02,670
political systems to the rest of the 
country as a business sector,

19
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,810
more typical of northern Europe than 
southern Europe.

20
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:13,230
Moreover,
this area has it's own language.

21
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:14,093
This is called a will scatter.
Unlike castle on a hill scatter sounds 

22
00:01:17,041 --> 00:01:21,150
nothing like casper and,
but that is not all like a catalonia.

23
00:01:21,151 --> 00:01:21,984
The Basque country.
Also has an important separatist 

24
00:01:24,211 --> 00:01:25,170
movement.
In fact,

25
00:01:25,171 --> 00:01:29,100
10 years before castle and politicians 
began to demand independence,

26
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:32,280
the basket governments had also tried to
become a sovereign state.

27
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:34,260
This was known as the [inaudible] j 
plan.

28
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,153
See the then president of the basket 
country borders is officially called to 

29
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:38,533
the basket of [inaudible] Juan Jose 
about [inaudible] tried to divorce from 

30
00:01:42,241 --> 00:01:43,074
Spain and they went pretty badly.
Most of that is something we are going 

31
00:01:46,501 --> 00:01:47,850
to address in a whole of the video.

32
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,400
Sorry,

33
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,233
let's get onto today's question and 
that's why is the best country and 

34
00:01:55,151 --> 00:01:59,380
Novari richer than the rest of Spain?
Why do we say that they have a different

35
00:01:59,381 --> 00:02:01,090
political systems the rest of the 
country?

36
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:01,983
Well,
we are going to answer all of those 

37
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:04,330
questions today,
but before we do,

38
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:09,420
let's dive into the history.
We'll heritage both regions.

39
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:10,754
The Basque Country End Avara have a 
special status called the Basque 

40
00:02:13,910 --> 00:02:14,743
economic agreements.
Any people think that this special 

41
00:02:16,911 --> 00:02:17,744
status came from the Middle Ages,
but the truth is that it did see in the 

42
00:02:23,591 --> 00:02:24,424
year 1200 the ancient kingdom of Novari 
what are now known as the are larva is 

43
00:02:28,331 --> 00:02:33,331
Kaia and geepers Korea provinces and 
Nevara itself joins the castiel crown as

44
00:02:33,671 --> 00:02:34,504
a condition for this union.
The castilian king had to recognize 

45
00:02:36,821 --> 00:02:39,460
these circles and never reason Queiroz 
or laws.

46
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:42,763
That is to say that this kingdom would 
maintain an independent government with 

47
00:02:45,621 --> 00:02:47,660
its own laws,
its own courts,

48
00:02:47,780 --> 00:02:49,790
and did sent taxes.
For example,

49
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:53,390
no Novaris citizen could be forced to do
military service.

50
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:57,710
These novaris laws remained practically 
unchanged for centuries,

51
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:58,573
but don't think that this is an anomaly.
Every feudal law absolutest political 

52
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,730
system,
be it in Spain,

53
00:03:03,731 --> 00:03:04,564
France or the United Kingdom was full of
regions with special rights and special 

54
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,580
laws.
However,

55
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:12,760
things changed in the 19th century.
At that time,

56
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:13,623
Spain was consolidated as a modern state
and then decided to innovate the model 

57
00:03:17,951 --> 00:03:20,650
of Napoleon's France.
That is a centrist

58
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:21,573
model.

59
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,023
Well.
That means that almost every law would 

60
00:03:25,811 --> 00:03:29,860
be dictated from the capsule and would 
apply equally throughout the territory.

61
00:03:29,980 --> 00:03:32,920
As you can imagine,
this did not please the Novari's and the

62
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,030
Basque citizens.
Suddenly that's paying more taxes and do

63
00:03:37,031 --> 00:03:40,030
compulsory military service.
Not a great combination.

64
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,430
There's explains why during the 19th 
century,

65
00:03:42,431 --> 00:03:44,230
Spain had not one,
not two,

66
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:45,123
but three civil wars.
These were the so called car list was 

67
00:03:49,121 --> 00:03:49,954
where the old regime supporters mainly 
basques and Novaris fought against the 

68
00:03:53,651 --> 00:03:54,484
Spanish army.
Then in 1876 when these novaris basket 

69
00:03:57,061 --> 00:04:00,100
trips where if he did the laws 
abolished,

70
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,510
suddenly these four provinces have to 
follow the laws that came from the dread

71
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:08,193
and in addition,
they have to pay a percentage of their 

72
00:04:09,421 --> 00:04:10,254
taxes to the central states and Roseanne
Madrid's allowed them to retain a 

73
00:04:13,261 --> 00:04:14,094
special fiscal status.
And this concession is what we call the 

74
00:04:17,341 --> 00:04:19,950
Basque agreement,
which as you can see,

75
00:04:20,020 --> 00:04:20,853
wasn't born in the middle ages,
but it was approved in exchange for 

76
00:04:23,701 --> 00:04:25,980
abolishing of the laws.
But it doesn't end there.

77
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:29,303
Decades later in 1939 Franco's 
dictatorship eliminated this economic 

78
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,374
agreement,
but only in the two provinces that 

79
00:04:35,881 --> 00:04:39,180
didn't support him.
We boost Koa and Vizcaya.

80
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,273
No,
as you can already see from all of this 

81
00:04:40,901 --> 00:04:44,910
is around the torture of story with wars
and demands from both sides,

82
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:45,773
both provinces,
which lost their special fiscal 

83
00:04:47,071 --> 00:04:47,904
conditions where especially hers,
and this can be seen today where a huge 

84
00:04:50,911 --> 00:04:51,744
percentage of Bisco lions and Quepos 
Koans wants independence from Spain and 

85
00:04:55,411 --> 00:04:56,244
all.
This explains why in the 1970s the new 

86
00:04:57,511 --> 00:04:58,344
democratic Spanish constitutions writers
it to compensate bask and Navarro the 

87
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:06,570
Basque agreements resends but this time 
in a modernized version,

88
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:14,410
the Basque quota,
this is one of the most confusing issues

89
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,900
in Spanish politics.
See,

90
00:05:15,901 --> 00:05:17,870
if a citizen lives in Malaga Raw,
valid,

91
00:05:17,871 --> 00:05:18,704
the lid,
he or she pays most of their taxes 

92
00:05:20,261 --> 00:05:22,570
directly to the central governments.
Of course,

93
00:05:22,571 --> 00:05:23,404
there are some special taxes that 
depends on the city or the autonomous 

94
00:05:26,501 --> 00:05:27,334
community.
That's the vast majority goes to the 

95
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,293
National Treasury afterwards,
the state distributes this money among 

96
00:05:33,790 --> 00:05:36,780
the different autonomous governments as 
they see fit.

97
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:37,753
Yes,

98
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:44,200
these are the so called autonomic 
transfers.

99
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,123
And of course some regions tend to 
benefits from these transverse and 

100
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:50,860
others are harmed.
In theory,

101
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:51,694
and this is quite debatable,
the richer regions help the poorer 

102
00:05:54,701 --> 00:05:55,960
regions.
However,

103
00:05:55,990 --> 00:05:59,780
both Navarro ans the Basque country have
a different system.

104
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:00,883
In this case,
the provincial governments collect 

105
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:07,340
almost all of the taxes.
And notice it that I said provincial.

106
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:09,710
This means that if a citizen lives,
for example,

107
00:06:09,711 --> 00:06:10,544
in Bilbao,
they do not pay taxes to the Basque 

108
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:16,130
government,
but to the Vizcaya provincial council,

109
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:20,510
and this provincial governments has the 
autonomy to do things like this.

110
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:28,980
This KAIA will change taxes on company 
profits to increase competitiveness.

111
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:33,310
So maybe you remember in another video 
we told you why Switzerland is so rich.

112
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:34,173
Now,
one of the reasons for this is that in 

113
00:06:34,871 --> 00:06:35,704
Switzerland,
each cans on it can compete with each 

114
00:06:36,941 --> 00:06:39,550
other by offering better fiscal 
conditions.

115
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:40,533
Well,
something similar is happening in the 

116
00:06:41,291 --> 00:06:42,124
basket and the Var provinces.
And that explains why it taxation in 

117
00:06:44,741 --> 00:06:47,950
these regions is a little lower than it 
is in the rest of Spain.

118
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:49,420
Nope.
You may be wondering,

119
00:06:49,570 --> 00:06:53,080
do these provincial councils pay nothing
to the Spanish state?

120
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:53,771
Well,
no,

121
00:06:53,771 --> 00:06:54,604
there's none of that.
So that's where the so called basket 

122
00:06:55,931 --> 00:07:00,070
quarter comes into play.
The Basque quota is the percentage these

123
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:00,904
regions pay to the central government in
exchange for the common services they 

124
00:07:04,211 --> 00:07:05,170
enjoy for belonging.

125
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:06,473
Thanks.

126
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,270
Sample the army,
embassies and roads.

127
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:16,440
All these are paid by Madrid,
but the basques can also enjoy them.

128
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,260
They therefore I have to pay part of the
cost.

129
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,030
And not only that,
if for example,

130
00:07:21,031 --> 00:07:23,190
Spain decided to increase the defense 
budget,

131
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:26,400
the basket quarter would also grow 
proportionally.

132
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:28,730
As you can imagine,
all of this is the irascible.

133
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:32,550
The truth isn't the basket quota is the 
result of political negotiations.

134
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:34,770
That's a different story for a different
day.

135
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:35,663
The truth is those,
unlike all the other autonomous 

136
00:07:37,531 --> 00:07:38,364
communities,
the Basque country and Nevara know 

137
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,820
exactly how much money they pay for the 
common cause and how much remains,

138
00:07:44,821 --> 00:07:47,430
and in most cases,
this is a fantastic advantage.

139
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:50,790
But just wait a moment because this 
doesn't end.

140
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,280
Yeah.
In principal,

141
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:58,820
it might seem that the economic 
agreements is a fair system.

142
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:01,520
Everything in the negotiation is black 
and white,

143
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:04,850
but the truth is that the system is far 
from perfect.

144
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:07,500
Do you remember when I said that the 
central state distributes the money that

145
00:08:07,501 --> 00:08:09,980
it collects among the different 
autonomous communities?

146
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:10,843
While the truth is that both Nevara ans 
the Basque country belong to this 

147
00:08:14,691 --> 00:08:17,240
distribution and it's being such rich 
regions,

148
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,200
it would be logical to think that they 
would contribute more than they receive.

149
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,540
Well,
that is totally not happening.

150
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:26,780
Basque

151
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:30,890
country receives twice as many resources
per capita as Madrid,

152
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,320
Catalonia,
or Andalusia and say,

153
00:08:33,321 --> 00:08:35,420
now you maybe asking yourself this and 
that as well.

154
00:08:35,690 --> 00:08:38,720
How is this possible?
The reason why it's purely political,

155
00:08:38,840 --> 00:08:39,673
as I was saying,
basket nationalism is as important as 

156
00:08:42,621 --> 00:08:43,880
Kassala national,
isn't it?

157
00:08:44,090 --> 00:08:44,923
That means there's these autonomous 
communities have their own political 

158
00:08:47,901 --> 00:08:48,734
parties,
parties such as the Basque Nationalist 

159
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,520
Party,
which holds its communities,

160
00:08:52,521 --> 00:08:53,354
governments and has a strong 
representation and the national 

161
00:08:56,011 --> 00:08:57,030
parliaments,
well,

162
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:57,923
every year the central government has to
approve national budgets in parliaments 

163
00:09:01,560 --> 00:09:02,393
for that,
they need an absolute majority and 

164
00:09:04,101 --> 00:09:08,340
majority that's in most cases requires 
support from these parties.

165
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:09,353
However,
this isn't the only reason for the 

166
00:09:10,471 --> 00:09:12,750
Basque country's prosperity.
Not at all.

167
00:09:12,751 --> 00:09:13,584
In fact,
there's much more at play here and look 

168
00:09:16,471 --> 00:09:17,304
into it right now.

169
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,483
Germany and Spain,
have you heard of a company called 

170
00:09:23,210 --> 00:09:23,921
Audley?
Well,

171
00:09:23,921 --> 00:09:27,310
if you have a gas stove,
you might own some of their products.

172
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:31,780
It's the world leader in manufacturing 
systems for preventing accidents and gas

173
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:32,614
leaks and their headquarters are in 
order Zia a town in the gift this Koa 

174
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:35,974
province.
The same goes for j m a if you have an 

175
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:38,914
armored door in your house,
it's highly likely that both the lock 

176
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,960
and the keys have been manufactured by 
this company,

177
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,010
which is located in drag on.
This is a small Basque town.

178
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:53,310
These are the so called hidden leaders.
They are small,

179
00:09:55,041 --> 00:09:55,874
hyper specialized companies that have 
become benchmarks in their niche and 

180
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:01,220
which have devastated the international 
markets.

181
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,143
In a previous video we told you,
you have Germany o's part of its wealth 

182
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:06,050
to Middle Astons.
Well,

183
00:10:06,051 --> 00:10:08,150
the Basque economic model is very 
similar.

184
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:10,520
Moreover,
if you have the opportunity to travel by

185
00:10:10,521 --> 00:10:11,354
road through IES Katie,
you'll see factories disbursed 

186
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,650
throughout its landscape.
In fact,

187
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:19,880
it's population is much more scattered 
than anywhere else in Spain.

188
00:10:19,940 --> 00:10:22,010
Of course,
there are large cities,

189
00:10:22,070 --> 00:10:25,480
but most people live in urban centers 
have less than 40,000 inhabitants.

190
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:30,643
These municipalities,
business hubs then employ locals in the 

191
00:10:33,711 --> 00:10:34,544
Basque country.
Economic activity isn't only 

192
00:10:36,711 --> 00:10:38,670
concentrated in large cities,
and I,

193
00:10:38,671 --> 00:10:39,740
you may ask yourself,
well,

194
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:43,700
why does [inaudible] have such a 
homogenous business network for this?

195
00:10:43,701 --> 00:10:46,260
We resent to the same principle at 
knots,

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,113
decentralization by having four 
different treasuries with autonomy to 

197
00:10:49,851 --> 00:10:54,380
collects taxes and make investments.
There's a higher tax competition than in

198
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:55,243
any other parts of Spain.
This means that public investments arms 

199
00:10:58,100 --> 00:11:01,910
concentrated in a specific place,
but are distributed evenly.

200
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:09,760
Investing in startups will have a 30% 
deduction in GIB boosie core.

201
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,260
In other words,
it's true,

202
00:11:11,290 --> 00:11:12,123
both the basques ans the Novari is have 
a huge advantage because they receive 

203
00:11:16,061 --> 00:11:16,894
money from the central states,
but that money has been invested much 

204
00:11:19,781 --> 00:11:22,150
more efficiently than in any other 
region.

205
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:23,103
In fact,
isn't it a coincidence that these two 

206
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:27,730
communities are the least indebted in 
all of Spain?

207
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,673
And that's in addition,
they have hardly any of the corruption 

208
00:11:30,941 --> 00:11:33,180
cases that have poisoned the rest of the
car

209
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:34,113
tree.

210
00:11:37,310 --> 00:11:40,610
So now the question is,
do you think some elements of the basket

211
00:11:40,611 --> 00:11:44,450
Novari's models could be rescued and 
replicated in other countries?

212
00:11:44,451 --> 00:11:45,284
Do you think it would be possible to 
apply the Basque agreements to other 

213
00:11:47,721 --> 00:11:48,531
regions?
Well,

214
00:11:48,531 --> 00:11:51,470
