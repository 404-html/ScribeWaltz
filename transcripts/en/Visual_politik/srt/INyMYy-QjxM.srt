1
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,183
Just before we get started,
I'd like to give a quick plug for a new 

2
00:00:09,811 --> 00:00:13,860
channel that I've started at school 
biographics where we look at biographies

3
00:00:13,861 --> 00:00:16,720
of famous people from history as well as
the present day.

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,200
It's not all politics or that we have 
done some politics.

5
00:00:19,201 --> 00:00:22,120
We've looked at Vladimir Putin as well 
as almost swartz and I got.

6
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,710
I know he definitely covers both fields,
but please do check it out.

7
00:00:25,711 --> 00:00:27,560
There is a link in the description below
our,

8
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:28,413
I'd say you probably know pieces of 
field build companies and I support 

9
00:00:30,781 --> 00:00:33,990
people who are building new things.
He was one of the founders of paypal,

10
00:00:33,991 --> 00:00:34,824
the first investor in facebook,
and he's one of the most important 

11
00:00:37,081 --> 00:00:40,080
technology and venture capital Gurus in 
the world.

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,220
He's obviously a multibillionaire.
That is also a bit of a peculiar guy.

13
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:45,083
For instance,
he financed projects like the Sea 

14
00:00:47,610 --> 00:00:48,443
Standing Institute in organization aimed
at being a politically autonomous 

15
00:00:50,251 --> 00:00:51,084
floating city and is also funded anti 
aging research by using the blood of 

16
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:55,290
young people.

17
00:00:55,310 --> 00:00:56,143
These are the thiel is also known for 
being the biggest supporter of Donald 

18
00:00:58,980 --> 00:00:59,813
Trump in silicon valley.
Although in some conversations with 

19
00:01:01,891 --> 00:01:06,060
journalists recently,
he's already shown some concerns.

20
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:07,553
I mean,
what the hell all of us have the right 

21
00:01:08,371 --> 00:01:10,610
to be wrong sometimes.
The thing is this,

22
00:01:10,630 --> 00:01:11,463
in 2011 Peter Thiel was granted New 
Zealand citizenship and told his 

23
00:01:14,371 --> 00:01:16,170
application.
He said this,

24
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:17,723
I'm happy to say categorically that I've
found no other country that aligns more 

25
00:01:21,031 --> 00:01:22,950
with my view of the future,
the New Zealand.

26
00:01:23,070 --> 00:01:25,080
The truth is that this is probably no 
surprise to you,

27
00:01:25,081 --> 00:01:26,490
regular viewers,
a visual politic.

28
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,324
We've already said into other videos how
much we love this country and not just 

29
00:01:29,911 --> 00:01:30,744
for its beauty.
Although New Zealand is one of the most 

30
00:01:32,011 --> 00:01:35,190
beautiful countries in the world.
There are also an example to be followed

31
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:36,043
to take a look at these statements.
All former prime minister billing about 

32
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,264
his predecessor.

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:42,713
Occasionally John would come home and 
complain that he was the only one who 

34
00:01:44,971 --> 00:01:45,804
didn't have a jet and how his colleagues
were horrified to find that he as a 

35
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:51,570
world leader had to travel on commercial
aircraft,

36
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:52,463
but I assured him that it was character 
building and kept them in touch with 

37
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:56,010
normal people.
Bill English,

38
00:01:56,550 --> 00:01:59,490
no New Zealand doesn't have an air force
one of their own,

39
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:00,353
but it is one of the easiest countries 
to do business in and as we've already 

40
00:02:03,271 --> 00:02:04,760
seen,
it's one of the most prosperous,

41
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,360
least corrupt and safest countries on 
the

42
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:08,263
planets.

43
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,140
Unless onto that,
they're first rate public services.

44
00:02:19,141 --> 00:02:19,974
Their ranking is one of the countries 
with the highest standards of living as 

45
00:02:22,711 --> 00:02:24,990
well as having one of the lowest 
employment rates.

46
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,050
Just take a look at this chart.
They weren't always like this.

47
00:02:41,320 --> 00:02:42,153
The Sun didn't always ride.
There's no doubt that New Zealand is a 

48
00:02:46,741 --> 00:02:49,560
top rate country,
but things weren't always like that.

49
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:51,480
I'm definitely not.
Not at all.

50
00:02:51,481 --> 00:02:52,314
In fact,
what we are going to see now is a real 

51
00:02:53,941 --> 00:02:54,774
story.
The story of the country that was 

52
00:02:55,861 --> 00:02:59,920
determined to learn from its mistakes,
to transform everything didn't work,

53
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,760
and by doing so become an international 
role.

54
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,350
Well,
this is definitely not the norm.

55
00:03:09,351 --> 00:03:13,580
Placing people first before any kind of 
ideology and the electorial interests.

56
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:16,430
It's not so common,
at least not in most countries,

57
00:03:16,431 --> 00:03:18,080
but let's see what happens.

58
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:22,403
Well,
the first thing we have to say is that 

59
00:03:23,191 --> 00:03:26,070
New Zealand was always a relatively 
wealthy country.

60
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:27,660
In fact,
by the late 19 fifties,

61
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:30,810
this country had the third highest per 
capita income in the world,

62
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,750
which is certainly not bad,
right?

63
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,093
Just wait a moment because that's the 
moment when things started to get a bit 

64
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:40,050
worse,
bad enough.

65
00:03:40,051 --> 00:03:41,400
In fact,
the by 1984,

66
00:03:41,401 --> 00:03:45,000
the per capita income was similar to 
that of Portugal or Turkey.

67
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:46,230
So.
Well now you're probably wondering,

68
00:03:46,231 --> 00:03:49,770
well what happens,
but New Zealand's to drop so far.

69
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:51,360
Well,
it could be said that the government,

70
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,220
they went a bit too far.
By that time,

71
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:54,083
the government of New Zealand had 
meddled with the economy to such an 

72
00:03:56,161 --> 00:03:58,770
extent that it's hard to even imagine 
what it was like.

73
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,140
There were many,
many taxes.

74
00:04:07,141 --> 00:04:10,290
Most of them incredibly complex and most
of them really,

75
00:04:10,291 --> 00:04:12,540
really high.
Just so you can get an idea of that.

76
00:04:12,541 --> 00:04:13,374
The highest income tax rate was almost 
70 percent and the lowest was still 40 

77
00:04:17,701 --> 00:04:19,170
percent and companies,
well,

78
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,980
they didn't get any better treatments.
The profit tax was 48 percent,

79
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:25,860
which is twice as much as the world's 
average nowadays,

80
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:29,100
and on top of all of that,
there were tons of regulations.

81
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,200
There were price controls for almost any
product,

82
00:04:31,201 --> 00:04:32,034
currency controls,
and that's just scratching the surface 

83
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,973
as an example.
Any import require the approval of the 

84
00:04:36,961 --> 00:04:40,740
administration and it was really hard 
for New Zealanders to invest their money

85
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:44,070
outside of the country.
We have foreign exchange controls.

86
00:04:44,071 --> 00:04:44,904
That meant I couldn't buy a subscription
to the Economist magazine without the 

87
00:04:47,821 --> 00:04:50,580
permission of the Minister of Finance,
Maurice,

88
00:04:50,581 --> 00:04:53,460
p mcteague,
former minister of the government of New

89
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:55,140
Zealand.
Look the controls and regulations.

90
00:04:55,141 --> 00:04:57,360
They didn't just establish a minimum 
wages.

91
00:04:57,390 --> 00:04:59,970
They also set caps for the maximum.
Yep.

92
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:01,490
You heard that?
Absolutely right.

93
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,830
But let's say that a business owner 
wanted to pay a bonus to his workers.

94
00:05:04,831 --> 00:05:06,750
Well,
that wasn't an easy task

95
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:07,613
ask

96
00:05:13,130 --> 00:05:13,963
and as you can imagine,
the state owned and controlled almost 

97
00:05:15,651 --> 00:05:17,720
every large national company,
media,

98
00:05:17,721 --> 00:05:19,070
airlines,
insurance companies,

99
00:05:19,071 --> 00:05:20,630
banks,
even hotels.

100
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:23,540
Yet the government was really managing 
hotels.

101
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,190
Not Joking here.
So in other words,

102
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:26,024
the early 19 eighties,
New Zealand was the very example of 

103
00:05:28,281 --> 00:05:29,114
extreme statism in one way or another.
Almost everything was controlled by 

104
00:05:32,361 --> 00:05:36,560
bureaucrats and politicians and so well,
what were the consequences of all this?

105
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:38,690
They weren't exactly positive,

106
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,053
right.

107
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,863
After 23 years of deficits and the 
government's balance public debt has 

108
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,613
absolutely skyrocketed.
It was to figure unemployment's private 

109
00:05:51,621 --> 00:05:54,140
investors were pulling out of the 
country and the Kiwi youth,

110
00:05:54,170 --> 00:05:55,003
while they were fleeing in huge numbers 
by that time doing business in New 

111
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,293
Zealand,
it was an enormously complicated 

112
00:06:00,021 --> 00:06:01,340
process.
And to be honest,

113
00:06:01,341 --> 00:06:02,174
it was only attempted by the bravest.
Everything started to change in 1984 

114
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:11,260
when elections took place.
Plan to move forward

115
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,340
in 1984 in the midst of a tough crisis,
elections were celebrated.

116
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,930
The winner was David longer you have the
center left party.

117
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,050
This nation is at risk is how basic it 
is.

118
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,493
The new government,
they had a purpose to overcome the 

119
00:06:36,391 --> 00:06:38,820
crisis and still change the national 
model.

120
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,330
They are to replace everything that 
didn't work and to make sure they did it

121
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,193
without leaving anybody behind.
While at the same time granting the 

122
00:06:46,441 --> 00:06:48,720
opportunities for others to move 
forward.

123
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,000
So even though David [inaudible] was the
prime minister,

124
00:06:51,001 --> 00:06:51,834
the leader of this whole process was the
minister of Finance and that was sent 

125
00:06:54,931 --> 00:06:56,490
Roger Douglas.
In fact,

126
00:06:56,491 --> 00:06:59,970
the process is named after him.
It's known as Roger Nomix.

127
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,360
We went probably from being the most 
regulated,

128
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:03,203
uh,
in the developed world to the least 

129
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:08,790
Reagan a regulator.
We actually discussed this in a previous

130
00:07:08,791 --> 00:07:09,624
video where we talked about the 
agricultural reforms that have been so 

131
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,473
successful in New Zealand is Roger 
Douglas started and ambitious reform 

132
00:07:15,511 --> 00:07:16,344
program known as Rajan Nanex in this 
program that many areas of the economy 

133
00:07:19,831 --> 00:07:20,664
were liberalized and this included the 
primary sector and these changes took 

134
00:07:23,851 --> 00:07:24,684
place almost overnight.
Price controls were eliminated and most 

135
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:31,830
farming subsidies were removed.
But Roger Nomix,

136
00:07:31,831 --> 00:07:36,120
it wasn't just about agriculture.
The plan affected almost every aspect of

137
00:07:36,121 --> 00:07:38,460
the state and created a new political 
culture.

138
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:39,323
In fact,
by the time the rights international 

139
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:43,230
party won the elections in 1990 and took
power again,

140
00:07:43,260 --> 00:07:44,093
everything had changed.
And the new government followed the 

141
00:07:45,961 --> 00:07:47,730
labor process.
Roger Nomix.

142
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,593
It was a political philosophy that 
radically changed the country between 

143
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:54,600
the year 1984 and the beginnings of the 
21st century.

144
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:07,900
The first thing that the government did 
was declared a war on bureaucracy.

145
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,450
They did it in three ways.
First,

146
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:13,810
they did a thorough analysis of every 
governmental departments.

147
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,673
If what they did was not essential or 
could be better done by the market as 

148
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,790
well.
That was the end of it.

149
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:19,653
Following the same pattern.
They started an ambitious plan of 

150
00:08:21,701 --> 00:08:23,020
privatization.
I mean,

151
00:08:23,021 --> 00:08:24,850
think about it.
What was the state doing?

152
00:08:24,851 --> 00:08:28,630
Wasting time managing hotels,
airlines or telecommunications,

153
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,523
thanks to competition.
The market could do a much better job 

154
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,120
hands with less cost and more 
innovation.

155
00:08:34,170 --> 00:08:37,210
Pie Come at it from an angle of what's 
good for the consumer.

156
00:08:37,570 --> 00:08:38,860
Uh,
the provider.

157
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:40,023
I don't care a fundamentally who the 
provider might be a might be a public 

158
00:08:43,661 --> 00:08:45,610
institution,
a private institution,

159
00:08:45,611 --> 00:08:49,510
so long as it serves the consumer or the
taxpayer.

160
00:08:49,511 --> 00:08:50,344
That's where I come from.
Seconds of the 35 remaining public 

161
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:54,364
agencies,
the government made management work 

162
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,060
under market conditions.

163
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,640
This was the case for air traffic 
controllers for instance.

164
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:02,100
And the results,
they were totally terrific.

165
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:02,963
Not so neat.
Did the services of these public 

166
00:09:04,201 --> 00:09:05,034
agencies improve?
They went from costing the government a 

167
00:09:07,710 --> 00:09:08,543
billion dollars every year to generating
with taxes and profits more than a 

168
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,653
billion dollars.
This is money that could then be put 

169
00:09:13,831 --> 00:09:16,710
into things like education,
health care and culture.

170
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:20,430
But that wasn't the end of it.
Since regulations and laws were numerous

171
00:09:20,431 --> 00:09:21,264
and complex,
the government decided to work towards 

172
00:09:22,951 --> 00:09:23,784
an important goal and that was the 
simplification and elimination of any 

173
00:09:27,151 --> 00:09:27,984
laws that they deemed unnecessary.
And so what was the result of all of 

174
00:09:30,901 --> 00:09:31,734
these changes when you started this 
process with the Department of 

175
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:36,120
Transportation?
It had 5,600

176
00:09:36,121 --> 00:09:38,280
employees.
When we finished it had 53.

177
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,980
When we started with the forest service,
it had 17,000

178
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:43,410
employees.
When we finished it had 17.

179
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:47,160
Maurice p mcteague ends unemployment's.
It didn't increase.

180
00:09:47,310 --> 00:09:48,143
It was reduced.
So there's this very illustrative story 

181
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,710
and it actually involves deer as in the 
animals.

182
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,360
So when the British arrived in New 
Zealand,

183
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:56,220
the country doesn't have any large 
animals.

184
00:09:56,221 --> 00:09:59,520
So the wealthy families,
they imported deer for hunting as well.

185
00:09:59,550 --> 00:10:02,790
Can you guess what happens these days?
They spread rapidly,

186
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:03,624
forming the massive herds that ghost 
critical ecological damage by 

187
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:07,433
overgrazing thought 120 years.
The state had spent a lot of money 

188
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:14,250
trying to think this plague in order to 
preserve the local ecosystem.

189
00:10:19,150 --> 00:10:20,690
Well,

190
00:10:23,380 --> 00:10:24,213
one day they came up with a new idea.
Why couldn't they let farmers hunt and 

191
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:28,780
raised the deer fence?
Well,

192
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,850
that's exactly what they did.
Not saying that you did this,

193
00:10:30,851 --> 00:10:34,510
put an end to the plague.
New Zealand today is the world's largest

194
00:10:34,511 --> 00:10:35,344
supplier of deer meat and all of this.
It really does make sense and it's also 

195
00:10:38,351 --> 00:10:41,740
interesting to see what happened to 
taxes which were simplified in Regina.

196
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,953
Many were surprised by the results.
Tax Collection actually increased by 20 

197
00:10:51,621 --> 00:10:52,454
percent.

198
00:11:02,420 --> 00:11:03,253
The subsidization.
It was cost not only in agriculture but 

199
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:06,554
also in industry sectors,
but there was much more than just 

200
00:11:08,871 --> 00:11:09,704
economic reform here,
the reforms that reached the public 

201
00:11:11,481 --> 00:11:14,210
services and take a look at what happens
with education.

202
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:16,420
For instance,
the education budget of New Zealand.

203
00:11:16,421 --> 00:11:18,830
It hadn't stopped growing for years,
but the results,

204
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:21,500
they were just getting worse and worse.
So the question was,

205
00:11:21,501 --> 00:11:22,334
well,
a we students getting more stupid and 

206
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:27,290
that didn't really seem likely so when 
the government analyze the causes,

207
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,900
they realize this,
an important share of the budget was not

208
00:11:29,901 --> 00:11:33,320
actually being spent on education,
but on administration.

209
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:36,350
These were quality evaluation agencies,
rating firms,

210
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:40,040
dossie agencies and so on.
So what did the government decide to do?

211
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:42,500
Well,
they simply removed it all and they gave

212
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:46,130
the schools control with a management 
board chosen by the parents.

213
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:50,993
Also,
they allow parents to choose schools 

214
00:11:51,871 --> 00:11:53,190
freely,
private or public,

215
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:55,300
and the government would pay for it.
And well,

216
00:11:55,301 --> 00:11:59,380
what we can tell you now is that 
education results improved significantly

217
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:00,700
as well.
The same thing,

218
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,410
it happens with everything else.

219
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:06,583
New Zealand today,
it's a prosperous country with a very 

220
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:10,760
high standard of living and to use 
public services,

221
00:12:10,761 --> 00:12:13,790
education,
health and culture are among the best in

222
00:12:13,791 --> 00:12:15,900
the world.
So that leaves us thinking that museum,

223
00:12:15,901 --> 00:12:16,734
that it's an amazing example for 
countries in Latin America or some 

224
00:12:19,101 --> 00:12:21,140
European countries like Spain,
Italy,

225
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,340
Greece,
and Portugal.

226
00:12:22,370 --> 00:12:23,840
Well,
if anything is for certain,

227
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:26,660
is that the lands of Kiwis is a great 
country.

228
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,553
And now it's your turn.
Do you think that New Zealand makes a 

229
00:12:29,031 --> 00:12:30,530
good model to be followed?
Well,
