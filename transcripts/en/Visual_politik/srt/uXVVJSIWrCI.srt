1
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,333
This is the only country along with 
Greece that is cora now than before 

2
00:00:11,541 --> 00:00:12,374
having the euro as their official 
currency to figures leave no space for 

3
00:00:15,861 --> 00:00:16,694
doubt.
Italians now have less purchasing power 

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:19,513
than before they joined the euro,
which makes them one of the few 

5
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:24,460
countries that became worse off after 
joining the European.

6
00:00:24,461 --> 00:00:25,294
Yeah.

7
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,560
We also looking about the second biggest
industrial power in all of Europe,

8
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,750
which is only surpassed by Germany.
In fact,

9
00:00:36,751 --> 00:00:37,584
during the nineties,
the Italians were wealthier than the 

10
00:00:38,761 --> 00:00:39,930
British and the French.
Now,

11
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,730
if you're my age or older,
you might remember Ross Zazi,

12
00:00:42,810 --> 00:00:46,740
Luciano Pavarotti,
or these so called Spaghetti Westerns.

13
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:47,800
Yes.
To view isn't.

14
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:48,663
He was one of the biggest powerhouses on
the planet and all the spine to their 

15
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:56,430
governments and their ruling class.
The political history of Italy is our.

16
00:00:56,431 --> 00:00:57,264
Should we say it well,
let's just say it makes game of thrones 

17
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:04,431
looked like the gilmore girls.
Remember,

18
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:06,940
it's Allianz Se Sicilian,
Cosa Nostra,

19
00:01:06,941 --> 00:01:10,480
the Kalibrasi Drain Gretta,
the Napoleon Komora,

20
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,480
and many,
many other gangs and yes,

21
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:18,400
all of them have important connections 
with the highest levels of politicians,

22
00:01:18,490 --> 00:01:21,220
but there's more than just a Nafisa 
here.

23
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:22,143
During the Cold War,
some government officials held extreme 

24
00:01:24,101 --> 00:01:24,934
right wing terrorists.
Groups that organize the most violence 

25
00:01:26,961 --> 00:01:27,794
is acts that you could imagine,
and that's not even talking about the 

26
00:01:29,771 --> 00:01:32,740
extreme left wing,
which defines exactly stay quiet.

27
00:01:32,741 --> 00:01:36,610
Either the Red Brigades kidnapped and 
murdered an Italian pronunciation.

28
00:01:38,780 --> 00:01:39,613
Look,

29
00:01:40,070 --> 00:01:40,903
if you're into scary stories,
you should google something about the 

30
00:01:42,711 --> 00:01:43,544
propaganda duo more.
You can just watch the movie Il Divo 

31
00:01:46,011 --> 00:01:46,844
from Paolo Sorrentino.
You will discover a fascinating country 

32
00:01:49,251 --> 00:01:52,400
where politics,
anything was boring and now you might be

33
00:01:52,401 --> 00:01:53,090
wondering,
well,

34
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:56,840
what exactly is going on in Italy today?
Do they have as much instability as they

35
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,150
did in the 19 seventies in the 19 
eighties?

36
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:02,780
And he also was absolutely in just 10 
years.

37
00:02:02,810 --> 00:02:05,930
If at six different prime ministers 10 
years.

38
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:06,853
In other words,
keeping up with Italian politics is 

39
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,423
pretty impossible mission and this is 
why in this video we're not actually 

40
00:02:11,961 --> 00:02:12,794
going to talk about the Italian 
elections that have been celebrated 

41
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:15,614
recently,
not even about Berlusconi's and love 

42
00:02:17,911 --> 00:02:19,070
life.
Oh no,

43
00:02:19,220 --> 00:02:20,053
because the real question here is how is
it possible that such a chaotic country 

44
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:27,800
could manage to become quite so wealthy 
and what is happening now?

45
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:31,170
Often two decades of economic 
stagnation.

46
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:34,230
Today we're going to answer both of 
those questions,

47
00:02:34,231 --> 00:02:36,870
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the good,

48
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,840
the bad,
and the ugly of Italian history.

49
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:44,290
Julio

50
00:02:44,290 --> 00:02:47,920
and the reality is the good.
During the 1940 years,

51
00:02:47,921 --> 00:02:48,754
the Italian Communist Party was the 
biggest of its kind all across western 

52
00:02:52,361 --> 00:02:55,960
Europe with more than one point 3 
million members.

53
00:02:55,961 --> 00:02:58,330
They could win an election anytime they 
want it.

54
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,610
As you can imagine,
the middle of the Cold War,

55
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,580
this was something America could not 
happen.

56
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,220
So you remember the Marshall Plan?
Well,

57
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:09,070
if you've been following visual politics
for a long time,

58
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:12,610
you already know that Uncle Sam sent 
lots and lots of money to Europe so they

59
00:03:12,611 --> 00:03:17,611
can rebuild that destroyed city when it 
came to you.

60
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,900
Isn't this money,
was not an immense to help the country,

61
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:22,853
but also to finance the only political 
party you could face that communist 

62
00:03:26,491 --> 00:03:27,324
threat.
This policy was called Christian 

63
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,373
democracy.
Mother's save your children from 

64
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:38,550
Bolshevism vote Christian democracy in 
the next 50 years.

65
00:03:38,590 --> 00:03:41,490
It's an he had 30 different prime 
ministers.

66
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:42,383
This means that the average span of an 
Italian government was a little more 

67
00:03:45,241 --> 00:03:47,850
than a year and a half,
but they all had something in common.

68
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:49,470
Most of them,
they were Christian.

69
00:03:49,471 --> 00:03:50,304
Democrat.
Governor within the Christian Democrats 

70
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,020
is a man that you should know.
His name was Julio,

71
00:04:00,851 --> 00:04:01,684
Andrea [inaudible],
and he became prime minister seven 

72
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:07,690
different times and is the real 
godfather of Christian democracy.

73
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:08,763
For years,
no Italian politician could do anything 

74
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,900
without being.
Last Minute Mrs Andreotti

75
00:04:17,330 --> 00:04:21,460
power wears out those who don't have it,
Julio and royalty.

76
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:23,410
But now the obvious question is,
well,

77
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,930
what did the Christian Democrats stand 
for?

78
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:26,853
Well,
Christine Democracy was basically what 

79
00:04:27,521 --> 00:04:28,354
we call a catch up all party.
Anyone except communists could find his 

80
00:04:31,061 --> 00:04:31,894
or her place inside of this policy,
and this included deals with Napoleon 

81
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:37,390
Kamora,
the Sicilian Cosa Nostra,

82
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:41,560
and allegedly extreme right wing groups 
that terrorize the country during the 19

83
00:04:41,561 --> 00:04:42,394
eighties,
but we're going to talk about all of 

84
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:44,914
that in a future video.
The important thing here is that 

85
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,513
Andreotti and his Christian Democrats 
badly needed popular support and you 

86
00:04:51,701 --> 00:04:53,440
know,
you need to win some elections.

87
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:58,800
Did you do that?
What's better than employing people with

88
00:04:58,801 --> 00:05:00,060
a good salary?
You see,

89
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:00,953
Italy has over three point $5 million 
civil servants and they are among the 

90
00:05:03,421 --> 00:05:04,254
highest paid in the entire world.
This means a crazy public spending and 

91
00:05:06,961 --> 00:05:09,060
lots of bureaucracy and toxins.
Okay?

92
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:13,000
Reality is time until now,
easily is famous for two things.

93
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:17,450
Redstate and ineffective course,
a better understanding.

94
00:05:17,451 --> 00:05:18,284
Let's imagine we have a company that 
produces construction machines and we 

95
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:24,890
have clients who doesn't pay US 
naturally.

96
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,690
We would probably want to take him to 
court

97
00:05:29,320 --> 00:05:33,130
if we all in say France.
This process could take around two and a

98
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:33,964
half months,
but in the you could wait more than 

99
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:39,550
three years before the problem gets 
solved.

100
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,450
As you might imagine,
this is not exactly the best of business

101
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,770
planets,
but nevertheless,

102
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:48,250
I did say this sleep became one of the 
wealthiest countries in all of Europe,

103
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,140
so how is that possible?

104
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:54,090
Well,

105
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:54,923
do you have.
You have the onset lies in the Italian 

106
00:05:56,461 --> 00:05:57,500
lira?
Yes.

107
00:05:57,501 --> 00:05:59,570
You heard that right?
When they had their own currency,

108
00:05:59,571 --> 00:06:00,404
the Italian central bank could evaluate 
their currency anytime they needed to 

109
00:06:03,621 --> 00:06:08,621
put their economy on steroids.
When now you might be wondering,

110
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:10,851
well,
but Simon,

111
00:06:10,851 --> 00:06:13,040
isn't that the worst thing that you 
could do?

112
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,410
For instance,
in another video I told you that Germany

113
00:06:15,411 --> 00:06:18,860
became rich partly because they have a 
very stable currency,

114
00:06:18,861 --> 00:06:22,370
the deutschmark and now it seems that 
I'm telling you the exact opposite.

115
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,233
I mean,
how is it possible to digitally could 

116
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,390
grapes so much having so much 
corruption,

117
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,350
so much red tape,
and it's just constant evaluations.

118
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,590
Well,
let's dive in.

119
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,390
Freddy is the ugly,

120
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:40,900
having exited more than 1700 movies.
Rocco said Freddy.

121
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:43,720
Okay.
The Italian stallion dominated the adult

122
00:06:43,721 --> 00:06:46,840
section of rental stores worldwide 
during the 19 eighties,

123
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:50,763
and yes,
he is also an interesting symbol of the 

124
00:06:52,571 --> 00:06:53,404
Italian economy at that time,
a growth model that relied heavily on 

125
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:01,170
inflation during the eighties and the 
nineties.

126
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:03,600
It's elite flooded the world with cheap 
products.

127
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:07,740
They were a kind of 20th century China.
As soon as something works in some other

128
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:08,574
country,
some Italian company would show up and 

129
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:12,300
make the same thing,
but do it cheaper.

130
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,510
Let's have a look as an example.
American movies in America,

131
00:07:15,540 --> 00:07:18,090
John Wayne Movies were incredibly 
successful.

132
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,073
Let's go to Debbie,
so it was highly and movie producers 

133
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,900
started doing more of the same,
but at the industrial level,

134
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:29,870
and this is how the Spaghetti Western 
was at the same time,

135
00:07:29,871 --> 00:07:32,420
the exact same thing was happening with 
other industries.

136
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:33,403
Well,
Donna summer was making the entire 

137
00:07:34,251 --> 00:07:35,084
world.
Dan's Italian struck back with Sabrina 

138
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:40,580
who did the same but cheaper and more 
explicitly.

139
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,873
What about animated movies?
Walt Disney was launching a landon in 

140
00:07:44,781 --> 00:07:45,614
movie theaters.
The cheap Italian version was already 

141
00:07:47,571 --> 00:07:50,360
available in all of the countries.
Video stores.

142
00:07:53,690 --> 00:07:54,523
That's innocently.
They were cheaply reproducing more than 

143
00:07:56,271 --> 00:07:57,104
just culture in general.
Italian companies mastered the art of 

144
00:07:59,691 --> 00:08:02,600
making cheap things,
or as economists would say,

145
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:06,350
low added value manufacturing isn't he 
produced clothes,

146
00:08:06,351 --> 00:08:08,540
furniture,
and plenty of plastic items.

147
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,030
If you bought an animated action figure 
in the 19 nineties,

148
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,330
it probably has a made in Italy label 
somewhere bus.

149
00:08:14,331 --> 00:08:15,164
If you bought a stereo sound system,
it would have a made in Germany or made 

150
00:08:18,171 --> 00:08:20,660
in Japan label and now the question 
arises,

151
00:08:20,661 --> 00:08:21,494
well,
why was the Italian economy so strongly 

152
00:08:23,811 --> 00:08:26,030
based on selling cheap things abroad?

153
00:08:26,450 --> 00:08:26,770
Well,

154
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:27,603
look at this chart,
you can see the value of the Italian 

155
00:08:29,321 --> 00:08:31,990
lira against the German mark.
As you can see,

156
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,853
during the eighties and nineties,
Italian currency was losing value all 

157
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,184
the time.
In 1980 you could get 450 liras for one 

158
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:41,854
German mark.
Fifteen years later you get a thousand 

159
00:08:44,350 --> 00:08:46,090
liras for one German mark.
So what does this mean?

160
00:08:46,210 --> 00:08:50,080
It means innovation was way more 
expensive for Italian companies than for

161
00:08:50,081 --> 00:08:50,914
German ones.

162
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,753
For instance,
imagine we have an Italian production 

163
00:08:53,261 --> 00:08:56,970
company during the 19 eighties and we 
want to a really innovative movie.

164
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,850
Something like star wars with state of 
the art,

165
00:08:59,851 --> 00:09:02,890
special effects and cutting edge 
technology if we want to do that,

166
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:03,724
so we need to buy animation software 
that's produced in Japan and special 

167
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:09,750
cameras from America,
but since our Italian currency is losing

168
00:09:09,780 --> 00:09:10,613
value all the time,
those things are more expensive for us 

169
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,360
and to answer this that anytime we need 
to hire someone new,

170
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,700
we're having to cut through never ending
red tape,

171
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,670
so suddenly not salmon is a good,
is it?

172
00:09:19,870 --> 00:09:20,703
Yeah,

173
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,860
but now imagine that instead of making a
stall was like film.

174
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:29,400
We call our friend Rocco's Freddy and we
make an adult movie with him.

175
00:09:29,460 --> 00:09:31,410
We just need a couple of cameras.
Remanned a bet,

176
00:09:31,590 --> 00:09:35,790
and since we have a weak currency,
we can sell on movies abroad for a lower

177
00:09:35,791 --> 00:09:38,820
price than any other film.
So simply following this model,

178
00:09:38,821 --> 00:09:41,370
the Italian economy,
it grew sky high.

179
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:48,323
During these years,
thousands of smaller companies were 

180
00:09:49,981 --> 00:09:51,570
born,
but make no mistake here,

181
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,690
Italian smes have nothing to do with 
German smes.

182
00:09:54,810 --> 00:09:55,643
You see,
German middle stands had between 50 and 

183
00:09:57,781 --> 00:10:02,781
200 workers and they had enough scale to
invest money on research and innovation.

184
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:03,773
Italian companies were way smaller than 
methods were more traditional and their 

185
00:10:06,751 --> 00:10:07,584
industries where well more in Italy 
started taking account of its shadow 

186
00:10:14,071 --> 00:10:17,130
economy,
found that it made up a fifth of Italian

187
00:10:17,131 --> 00:10:18,750
GDP.
As a result,

188
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:21,510
the economy grew by 18 percent 
overnight,

189
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:22,593
so now you might wonder,
why should Italians innovate so much if 

190
00:10:25,331 --> 00:10:28,240
they were doing so well by not doing it 
well.

191
00:10:28,510 --> 00:10:33,510
Now I'm going to tell you why Silvio 
Berlusconi is the ugly.

192
00:10:34,520 --> 00:10:35,360
Now,
finally,

193
00:10:35,361 --> 00:10:37,880
the 21st century,
Christine Democracy,

194
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:41,480
not really that important anymore.
Now the brand new leader of the center,

195
00:10:41,481 --> 00:10:44,120
right wing is the man you see on screen 
now and yes,

196
00:10:44,121 --> 00:10:46,880
you might know that his name is Silvio 
Berlusconi

197
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:53,410
little hair because my brain is so big,
it pushes everything else out.

198
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,603
Suvio Berlusconi thousands.
He was not the best year to the Italian 

199
00:10:58,030 --> 00:10:58,863
prime minister.
You know why?

200
00:10:59,080 --> 00:10:59,913
Well,
because 2002 was the Italy abandons the 

201
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,094
Italian lira and started using the euro.
And what's the main characteristic of 

202
00:11:06,761 --> 00:11:07,690
the euro?
Well,

203
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:08,583
no,
governments can decide by itself when 

204
00:11:10,661 --> 00:11:11,494
they devalue.
That's yours are issued by the European 

205
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,003
Central Bank,
which includes representatives of all 

206
00:11:16,151 --> 00:11:16,984
the member countries.
This was a big problem for a country 

207
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:19,504
like Italy,
which had become so addicted to 

208
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:23,020
devaluation,
but things don't stop there.

209
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:23,943
Maybe you remember another thing that 
happens at the beginning of the two 

210
00:11:26,531 --> 00:11:28,000
thousands.
And if you don't say,

211
00:11:28,030 --> 00:11:28,863
well let me refresh your memory.
Joins the World Trade Organization at 

212
00:11:34,271 --> 00:11:36,010
last.
And so now you might be wondering,

213
00:11:36,011 --> 00:11:36,844
well,
does China have to do with the Italian 

214
00:11:38,321 --> 00:11:39,190
economy?
Well,

215
00:11:39,191 --> 00:11:43,390
as you might guess rather lot,
the fact that China had joined the World

216
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,940
Trade Organization was a symptom of 
something much bigger as men's.

217
00:11:45,941 --> 00:11:46,774
All of Asia was flooding the 
international markets and it was not 

218
00:11:48,821 --> 00:11:49,654
only China.
Other countries like Thailand and 

219
00:11:51,190 --> 00:11:55,180
Bangladesh were already becoming 
manufacturing powerhouses.

220
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:56,073
And surprise surprise.
What did these countries start 

221
00:11:58,091 --> 00:11:59,980
manufacturing first?
Well,

222
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:01,690
very,
very cheap things.

223
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:04,270
Same as the Italians buts even cheaper.

224
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:08,853
Thanks.
Then Germany was already off technology 

225
00:12:11,121 --> 00:12:11,954
wise.
So despite the Asian competition that 

226
00:12:13,660 --> 00:12:15,160
products,
they were still competitive.

227
00:12:15,190 --> 00:12:19,140
Meanwhile isn't he could not go back to 
old school devaluation first,

228
00:12:19,141 --> 00:12:19,974
they were now part of the euro and 
second devaluing wasn't a solution 

229
00:12:23,020 --> 00:12:25,810
against Asia's cheap salaries.
Here's an example.

230
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,450
One of the most symbolic Italian 
companies is Fiat.

231
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,840
In 1998,
they sold over one point $3 million cars

232
00:12:31,841 --> 00:12:34,260
in your.
Now they only sell 700,000

233
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:35,800
and they can't get into new markets.

234
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:46,500
Other brands like BMW still maintain 
their share on their traditional markets

235
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:50,370
and also they're growing and emerging 
countries like China,

236
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:51,060
but just,
Oh,

237
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,430
hold on a minute here because we're not 
done yet.

238
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:56,900
You really know how it's has over 3 
million civil servants.

239
00:12:56,970 --> 00:12:59,700
Well,
they all still there and they still have

240
00:12:59,701 --> 00:13:00,930
to be paid.
In other words,

241
00:13:00,931 --> 00:13:01,764
while the Italian economy is falling and
the government is collecting fewer and 

242
00:13:03,901 --> 00:13:04,734
fewer taxes,
they all still spending the same amount 

243
00:13:07,291 --> 00:13:08,060
of money.
So what?

244
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:08,893
What does that mean?
It means essentially is now the fourth 

245
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,693
most indebted country on the planet.
They're public debt is over 130 percent 

246
00:13:15,871 --> 00:13:19,500
of their GDP,
and this certificate is simply crazy.

247
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:23,920
Is Europe's next big?

248
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:27,663
So now the question is,
should Italy abandon the euro so that 

249
00:13:30,971 --> 00:13:34,990
they can go back to that devaluation 
methods and cheap manufacturing?

250
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:36,513
Maybe they should follow the German 
model and let their companies innovate 

251
00:13:38,951 --> 00:13:39,784
more while I've said my piece.
