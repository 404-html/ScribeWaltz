1
00:00:08,150 --> 00:00:08,983
Yeah,

2
00:00:09,310 --> 00:00:10,143
that was stated by the famous Harvard 
University economics professor Edward 

3
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,360
Glaeser cities czar,
one of humanity's great creations.

4
00:00:16,361 --> 00:00:18,240
Cities.
They make us retro greener,

5
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:19,800
healthier,
happier.

6
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,070
If you are,
over time,

7
00:00:21,071 --> 00:00:24,600
cities have become a synonym for freedom
and prosperity.

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,463
Of course,
they are in precisely a new phenomenon 

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,510
since human beings stopped wandering 
from place to place in search of food.

10
00:00:30,511 --> 00:00:31,740
About 10,000
years ago,

11
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,603
they began to build settlements that 
over time became cities and it was 

12
00:00:35,521 --> 00:00:39,810
finally in the third millennium BC.
The great city states began to emerge in

13
00:00:39,811 --> 00:00:41,850
the Mesopotamian region.
City is like,

14
00:00:42,490 --> 00:00:45,240
oh my gosh,
Umar and it's the most popular one.

15
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:50,400
Babylon today,
5,000

16
00:00:50,451 --> 00:00:52,700
years later,
more than half of the world's population

17
00:00:52,701 --> 00:00:54,320
lives in cities,
and by the way,

18
00:00:54,321 --> 00:00:57,630
more than 500 of those cities have more 
than 1 million inhabitant.

19
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,143
There's no doubt about it.
The Great Take off of urbanism happens 

20
00:01:03,611 --> 00:01:06,400
in the 19th century with the industrial 
revolution.

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:07,263
Since then,
we've lived in a state of constant 

22
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:09,423
urbanization,
a process that has so far in deodorants 

23
00:01:11,660 --> 00:01:13,390
switch.
While it doesn't look like it's going to

24
00:01:13,391 --> 00:01:15,040
stop anytime soon.
See,

25
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:15,933
the United Nations predict that by the 
year 2050 almost 70% of the entire 

26
00:01:20,591 --> 00:01:21,424
world's population will live in cities.
What began in what we now know is 

27
00:01:24,371 --> 00:01:25,204
developed countries and since the mid 
20th century extended to developing 

28
00:01:28,151 --> 00:01:32,240
countries has led to a world dominated 
by huge metropolises.

29
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,281
Well,
one second.

30
00:01:39,281 --> 00:01:40,114
Well,
what exactly is the influence of big 

31
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:43,600
cities?
She wants him revealing facts.

32
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,530
Well,
here they are.

33
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,390
It's estimated that only the 600 most 
dynamic cities in the world where 23% of

34
00:01:49,391 --> 00:01:50,224
the planet's population lives generates 
55% of all economic activity in a few 

35
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:55,833
years.
That figures is going to exceed 60% in 

36
00:02:02,811 --> 00:02:03,644
other words,
our wells and our way of life depends 

37
00:02:05,481 --> 00:02:06,314
more and more on cities.
Cities off of the World Watch Messi 

38
00:02:09,561 --> 00:02:12,200
might be if a boss Ilona,
and this is a new phenomenon,

39
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:15,680
has emerged from this huge evolution,
and that's mega cities.

40
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:19,700
These are metropolises with more than 10
million inhabitants nowadays.

41
00:02:19,701 --> 00:02:23,210
There are no less than 43 of these on 
the planet and so check this out.

42
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:26,270
They all the places that are growing the
most in developing countries,

43
00:02:31,830 --> 00:02:34,260
and this presents a huge challenge.
In fact,

44
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,123
it causes so many problems that it's 
setting off major alarm bells allow me 

45
00:02:38,431 --> 00:02:40,440
to explain.
In the poorest countries in the world,

46
00:02:40,441 --> 00:02:44,760
cities are growing at a frantic and 
completely uncontrolled pace,

47
00:02:44,761 --> 00:02:47,070
which is generating very high levels of 
pollution,

48
00:02:47,071 --> 00:02:50,070
crime as chaotic traffic.
Many of the new mega cities,

49
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,290
they've simply devolved into chaos.
For example,

50
00:02:52,291 --> 00:02:56,340
check out these headlines from air 
pollution closes all schools in Tehran.

51
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,480
New Delhi is once again the most 
polluted city on earth.

52
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:03,640
At this point,
you might have several questions.

53
00:03:03,641 --> 00:03:07,030
Where will the most populated cities in 
the world be in a few decades?

54
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:09,820
What would be their future?
And most importantly,

55
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,940
what challenges do these new mega cities
face?

56
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,010
Well,
let's see.

57
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:23,010
New Giants,

58
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:26,443
I'm sorry.
Then unfortunately I have an assignment 

59
00:03:27,921 --> 00:03:28,754
for you.
You're going to need to learn and 

60
00:03:29,901 --> 00:03:32,570
remember some new city names because 
folks,

61
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:35,720
most of the new mega cities,
they arms even household names.

62
00:03:35,721 --> 00:03:36,554
Yet a recent study by the Ontario 
Institute of Technology as indicators 

63
00:03:39,231 --> 00:03:40,760
for the,
by the end of this century,

64
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:43,850
we can expect the largest cities not to 
be places like Tokyo,

65
00:03:43,851 --> 00:03:45,560
Mexico City,
New York,

66
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,640
but rather legos can Shasta and Dar es 
Salaam.

67
00:03:49,820 --> 00:03:51,200
Yes,
you heard that right?

68
00:03:51,201 --> 00:03:54,260
Future mega cities will be among other 
places in Africa.

69
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,193
Surprise.
While you shouldn't be at least if you 

70
00:03:56,421 --> 00:03:58,530
follow visual politic regularly on this 
channel,

71
00:03:58,531 --> 00:03:59,364
and we've already mentioned several 
times how the African continent is 

72
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:02,443
changing.

73
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,323
Okay.

74
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:08,100
Did that study by the Institute of 
Technology of Ontario,

75
00:04:08,101 --> 00:04:11,490
these three cities located in Nigeria,
the Congo in Tanzania,

76
00:04:11,491 --> 00:04:14,130
which are expected to be the largest 
cities in the world,

77
00:04:14,131 --> 00:04:18,750
could surpass the 75 million inhabitant 
mark by the end of the century.

78
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:22,530
75 million people is a truly enormous 
figure.

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,020
If this happens,
just one of these cities would have more

80
00:04:25,021 --> 00:04:27,270
inhabitants than all of Germany today.

81
00:04:30,140 --> 00:04:30,620
You

82
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:31,453
crazy,
right,

83
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,293
but hold on a second because we really 
don't need to go that far into the 

84
00:04:34,701 --> 00:04:37,250
future.
It's estimated that by the year 2050 and

85
00:04:37,251 --> 00:04:38,084
that's really not that far away.
If the five largest metropolitan areas 

86
00:04:40,431 --> 00:04:42,750
on the planet will be these places,
check it out.

87
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:43,584
Yeah.

88
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:46,243
Three

89
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:47,273
Lindsay,
I wanted Bangladesh ends another in the 

90
00:04:48,421 --> 00:04:49,254
Congo.
The largest of all of them will have 

91
00:04:50,401 --> 00:04:52,680
more than 40 million inhabitants.
Now,

92
00:04:52,681 --> 00:04:55,350
as you can imagine,
this poses a great deal of challenges.

93
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,213
If today,
many of these cities already have huge 

94
00:04:57,481 --> 00:04:58,314
problems,
imagine what it will be like in a few 

95
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:00,863
years.
Let's see exactly what we're dealing 

96
00:05:02,161 --> 00:05:07,161
with here.
The challenges

97
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:13,720
folks,
the case of Legos,

98
00:05:13,721 --> 00:05:16,780
Nigeria as larger city,
it's actually kind of amazing.

99
00:05:16,810 --> 00:05:19,870
In the 1960s this city barely had 
180,000

100
00:05:19,871 --> 00:05:20,704
inhabitants.
It looked like a small western style 

101
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:25,000
coastal town and it was surrounded by 
small villages.

102
00:05:25,150 --> 00:05:25,983
Today it's got more than 20 million 
inhabitants and it's simply when you 

103
00:05:29,471 --> 00:05:31,690
stop growing according to an existing 
estimates,

104
00:05:31,691 --> 00:05:35,260
this city is destined to become the most
populated place on the planet.

105
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:36,183
By the end of the century,
it could have more than 90 million 

106
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:39,573
inhabitants,
but there's an important point when we 

107
00:05:41,081 --> 00:05:41,914
talk about mega cities.
It's normal to think of huge 

108
00:05:43,181 --> 00:05:44,014
skyscrapers,
super imposed transport systems into 

109
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,340
gigantic avenues.
However,

110
00:05:48,341 --> 00:05:50,320
today in most cases,
the reality is very,

111
00:05:50,321 --> 00:05:51,154
very different.

112
00:05:52,340 --> 00:05:53,173
Sorry,

113
00:05:54,790 --> 00:05:59,150
Z with more than 20 million inhabitants.
Sligo since become a collapsed labyrinth

114
00:05:59,151 --> 00:06:02,660
of cars and motorcycles,
a place where power outages or frequence

115
00:06:02,661 --> 00:06:06,680
and public services such as water supply
and waste collection and treatments when

116
00:06:06,681 --> 00:06:07,514
they exist,
fail more often than a silicon valley 

117
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,754
startup.
And of course most of the population 

118
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,730
they live in crowded,
substandard housing and others in misery

119
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:21,440
because of course this excessive city 
growth,

120
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:22,274
it poses two kinds of problems.
One directly related to infrastructure 

121
00:06:25,491 --> 00:06:26,324
ends.
Can the other with the social and 

122
00:06:27,291 --> 00:06:29,210
political consequences that didn't 
involve

123
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:33,570
managing a city in excess of 50 million 
inhabitants,

124
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:34,433
is it daunting task,
especially as many of these cities are 

125
00:06:36,871 --> 00:06:41,400
woefully under serviced today?
65 years is a relatively short timeframe

126
00:06:41,401 --> 00:06:43,500
with regard to urban infrastructure.
Much of it,

127
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:44,453
for example,
London Underground and brome streets as 

128
00:06:46,531 --> 00:06:48,960
long lived and can take decades to 
develop.

129
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:50,910
Daniel Horn wag and Kevin Pope

130
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:53,820
see recently a United Nations study 
about Manila,

131
00:06:53,821 --> 00:06:57,240
the capital city of the Philippines,
and one of the fastest growing cities in

132
00:06:57,241 --> 00:06:58,074
the world.
Documents at a myriad of problems 

133
00:06:59,701 --> 00:07:02,280
related to waste management's according 
to this study,

134
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,153
garbage piles up in the streets and 
drainage problems and generating all 

135
00:07:05,761 --> 00:07:06,594
kinds of infectious outbreaks.
Another study also from the United 

136
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:13,070
Nations warns that in Mumbai,
the second most popular city in India is

137
00:07:13,071 --> 00:07:15,360
one that exceeds the 20 million and the 
habits and barrier,

138
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:16,243
but substandard housing and shacks are 
crowded on top of one another and the 

139
00:07:18,691 --> 00:07:20,670
streets aren't even finished,
and in many cases,

140
00:07:20,671 --> 00:07:23,640
they're not even paved.
Making them flood in the monsoon season,

141
00:07:23,641 --> 00:07:25,830
which doesn't do any calls,
huge amounts of destruction,

142
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:28,890
but the water ends up stagnating and 
spreading diseases.

143
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:29,753
Then there's the pollution.
Many of these cities are among the most 

144
00:07:32,491 --> 00:07:36,360
polluted in the world and we already saw
in a previous video just how much wealth

145
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:39,780
and pollution are related and the 
problems they don't end there.

146
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:42,563
This uncontrolled growth is also forcing
a large part of the population to live 

147
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:49,140
in neighborhoods and areas where they 
don't only lack of basic services,

148
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:52,110
but also important institutions like the
police.

149
00:07:52,140 --> 00:07:52,973
This is something that favors the spread
of Matthews and all kinds of criminal 

150
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:57,173
and radical groups.
That's precisely what mega cities like 

151
00:07:59,251 --> 00:08:00,084
San Pablo,
Rio de Janeiro and Mexico City are 

152
00:08:01,771 --> 00:08:02,604
experiencing folks in sale now.
The great metropolises of always been a 

153
00:08:07,381 --> 00:08:08,214
source of wealth and prosperity that of 
course there's no reason to think that 

154
00:08:11,371 --> 00:08:13,310
it's going to be any different this time
around.

155
00:08:13,311 --> 00:08:14,144
Yeah.

156
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:18,600
No country in the industrial era 
achieved any significant economic growth

157
00:08:18,601 --> 00:08:22,050
without urbanization.
Cities concentrate poverty,

158
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:25,260
but the also represent the main hope for
getting out of it.

159
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:28,500
You end state of the world population 
2007 right report.

160
00:08:28,630 --> 00:08:29,463
Okay.
Cities have always been the center of 

161
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:31,324
knowledge,
technological and artistic advances and 

162
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:35,350
new ideas.
Even at the political level,

163
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:36,184
people who live in cities.
I've traditionally had a more open 

164
00:08:38,261 --> 00:08:41,230
vision and I've been more tolerance and 
receptive to change.

165
00:08:41,260 --> 00:08:42,093
However,
with the emergence of these new mega 

166
00:08:43,031 --> 00:08:43,864
cities in a world of cities,
it looks like we're facing a challenge 

167
00:08:45,851 --> 00:08:46,684
with two possible outcomes.
First that these new urban giants will 

168
00:08:49,691 --> 00:08:53,020
bolster the local economy,
generate new ways of creating wealth,

169
00:08:53,021 --> 00:08:53,854
promote civil liberties,
and in the end be seen as the equals of 

170
00:08:56,401 --> 00:08:58,170
cities like Tokyo,
New York,

171
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,133
London.

172
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,053
The second outcome is that these cities 
will continue to grow in population 

173
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:08,414
without any substantial infrastructure 
improvements and that case the sum of 

174
00:09:11,691 --> 00:09:12,524
misery,
pollution and violence because ended up 

175
00:09:13,911 --> 00:09:14,744
creating new radical politicians or 
driving new refugee waves towards the 

176
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,850
more developed countries.
Well,

177
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:20,743
I'm sure you're not surprised,
but we on this channel like to think 

178
00:09:22,491 --> 00:09:23,324
that it will be the first.
We'd like to think that these new mega 

179
00:09:24,741 --> 00:09:25,574
cities will contribute to a better world
in the near future as well as in the 

180
00:09:28,521 --> 00:09:29,354
long term,
but for that they won't only need 

181
00:09:30,591 --> 00:09:31,424
solidarity and to aid above all,
they're going to need a lot of 

182
00:09:34,281 --> 00:09:35,114
investments anyways,
folks will be looking forward to all of 

183
00:09:37,161 --> 00:09:39,170
these changes and I really hope you 
enjoyed this video.
