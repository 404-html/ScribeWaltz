1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,030
Why is Donald Trump's so interested in 
punishing the Islamic Republic of Iran?

2
00:00:09,910 --> 00:00:12,400
If you've seen the previous two videos 
in this series,

3
00:00:12,401 --> 00:00:15,400
you might believe that he's interested 
in raising all prices,

4
00:00:15,430 --> 00:00:16,263
helping us Saudi friends.
I'll just showing the European Union 

5
00:00:18,971 --> 00:00:23,971
who's boss.
But here's another hypothesis.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:27,083
What if Donald Trump is actually going 
after the end of authoritarian rule in 

7
00:00:30,331 --> 00:00:32,610
Iran?
This is not a stupid theory.

8
00:00:32,620 --> 00:00:36,120
Iran is that the edge of economic 
collapse and to government protests,

9
00:00:36,121 --> 00:00:36,954
uh,
frequented.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,090
Unlike other countries in the regions in
Iran,

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,300
Dunn's have a secular,
liberal and democratic.

12
00:00:42,301 --> 00:00:43,134
Okay?

13
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,610
This means

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:54,620
you don't need to wage real war to bring
democracy to this country choking regime

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:55,463
financially,

16
00:00:55,730 --> 00:00:56,850
you know,

17
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:02,303
it actually works.
Donald trump could even be looking at a 

18
00:01:04,291 --> 00:01:06,330
Nobel peace prize.
Not only that,

19
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,450
it would make Obama look dumb and trump 
would win the 20,

20
00:01:09,451 --> 00:01:10,284
20 election for sure,
but what if it doesn't turn out as well 

21
00:01:12,871 --> 00:01:15,450
as he plans?
What if the ayatollah's regime is not as

22
00:01:15,451 --> 00:01:18,810
weak as he thinks?
Can Trump win the bat?

23
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:20,410
Well,
there's video.

24
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:25,420
It covers all of that.
Iran is the man.

25
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,260
America loves to hate,
of course,

26
00:01:31,261 --> 00:01:32,094
the White House claims that the nuclear 
sanctions are not meant to topple the 

27
00:01:35,071 --> 00:01:37,350
regime,
but is that really true?

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:46,890
House national security advisor,
John Bowlby says,

29
00:01:46,891 --> 00:01:49,980
the United States is not seeking to 
topple Iran's government,

30
00:01:49,981 --> 00:01:50,814
but since Washington does want 
authorities in Tehran to change their 

31
00:01:53,791 --> 00:01:55,980
behavior,
but truth is for decades,

32
00:01:55,981 --> 00:02:00,210
America has been trying to do everything
possible to curb the Iot has power.

33
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,223
For example,
have you ever heard of Radio Free 

34
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,840
Europe?
During the Cold War,

35
00:02:03,841 --> 00:02:07,980
the American Congress created this radio
station to spread anticommunist messages

36
00:02:08,040 --> 00:02:11,010
into the Soviet Union.
Today this radio is still exists.

37
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:15,060
Indeed they have their offices very 
close to where I am recording this video

38
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:16,440
in Prague,
in the Czech Republic,

39
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:17,453
and guess what?
This radio has a whole department just 

40
00:02:20,930 --> 00:02:21,763
defaulted to Iran.
They broadcast and using the Farsi 

41
00:02:23,970 --> 00:02:27,480
language to spread anti ayatollah 
messages in signing the contract.

42
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:32,360
Does

43
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:33,193
this mean this means that Washington is 
most definitely interested in a regime 

44
00:02:37,021 --> 00:02:37,854
change in Tehran,
but once you get really badly is one 

45
00:02:39,721 --> 00:02:40,554
thing,
whether it's actually possible is quite 

46
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,773
another.
So the question that might be in your 

47
00:02:43,891 --> 00:02:44,724
mind right now is,
is Iran really that bad of a 

48
00:02:47,311 --> 00:02:48,270
dictatorship?
I mean,

49
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,310
at the end of the day,
they've got elections,

50
00:02:50,311 --> 00:02:52,620
they've got political parties,
right?

51
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,010
Well,
yes and no.

52
00:02:56,070 --> 00:02:57,000
Yeah,
it is true,

53
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,873
but Iranians can vote for the president,
but the actual person in charge is the 

54
00:03:00,791 --> 00:03:01,624
supreme leader.
Ayatollah Khomeini for better 

55
00:03:06,831 --> 00:03:07,664
understanding how many shoes is most of 
the ministers and has the ultimate word 

56
00:03:11,031 --> 00:03:13,910
on international affairs and many of the
important,

57
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:18,810
oh,
and of course it goes without saying.

58
00:03:18,811 --> 00:03:19,644
The political dissidence I'll absolutely
prosecuted and often killed by the 

59
00:03:22,801 --> 00:03:24,000
government.
In fact,

60
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:25,950
despite having some opposition 
movements,

61
00:03:25,951 --> 00:03:29,490
there are almost no important leaders.
Why?

62
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:30,563
Well,
that's because they're all dead in 

63
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:35,850
prison or exiled.
Know what happens with the pro system,

64
00:03:35,851 --> 00:03:38,580
but physical forces,
well rather than political parties,

65
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:38,870
we should

66
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:43,870
talk about the different factions.
One Hand.

67
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,700
We have the so called hardliners,
hardliners,

68
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:49,543
support the system created by Khomeini 
to the letter religious law and state 

69
00:03:53,501 --> 00:03:58,501
led economy.
We have the reformers want to change the

70
00:04:00,101 --> 00:04:03,130
regime from the inside.
As you can imagine,

71
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:05,520
this faction is losing power nowadays.

72
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:09,150
Finally,

73
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:09,983
we have the pragmatist,
who's most important representative 

74
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,910
would be the current president,
Hassan Rouhani,

75
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:15,923
pragmatist lie,
somewhere in between the hardliners and 

76
00:04:18,271 --> 00:04:21,180
the reformers.
They want some economic reforms,

77
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:22,253
better relations with the West,
but also want to retain religious 

78
00:04:24,571 --> 00:04:26,200
control over the political system.

79
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,333
And here we have the second question.
Is it really possible for this whole 

80
00:04:30,551 --> 00:04:33,520
political system to fall apart?
Well,

81
00:04:33,610 --> 00:04:36,850
there is a chance you see when an 
economy is doing well,

82
00:04:36,851 --> 00:04:38,650
it's easy to keep an authoritarian 
system.

83
00:04:38,651 --> 00:04:39,484
Getting.
Many citizens are pretty much happy to 

84
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:41,270
say,
yeah,

85
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,510
I'll trade a bit of freedom if I get 
some welfare,

86
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:46,930
but Iran has spent too much time without
welfare.

87
00:04:47,170 --> 00:04:48,003
Iranian currency.
There y'all is devaluing every single 

88
00:04:50,351 --> 00:04:53,440
day and this has led to a brutal 
inflation.

89
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,393
Some non official estimates claim that 
Iran will have more than a hundred 

90
00:04:57,940 --> 00:04:58,773
percent inflation rate this year.
That means that some prices change on a 

91
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:02,704
daily basis.
Many foods like chicken are starting to 

92
00:05:04,571 --> 00:05:07,810
become scarce and there are more and 
more people living below the poverty.

93
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:16,910
Even with the government privatizations.
The economy is a mess.

94
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:17,803
We're already told you,
you right here on visual politic at the 

95
00:05:19,041 --> 00:05:19,874
beginning of the year,
2018 started with massive protests 

96
00:05:22,671 --> 00:05:24,200
against the Rouhani,
governments,

97
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:27,310
and many of those protesters were young 
university students.

98
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:28,730
He wanted a shift in the system,
uh,

99
00:05:28,750 --> 00:05:31,550
shifted to a system that's democratic,
secular,

100
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:33,070
and liberal.
But the question that,

101
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:33,913
the real question here is,
is all of this enough to cause regime 

102
00:05:37,311 --> 00:05:38,180
change?
Well,

103
00:05:38,181 --> 00:05:39,440
today we're going to answer that 
question,

104
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:42,140
but before we do,
let's take a look back at the history

105
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:47,640
taurine guard.
In the end.

106
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:50,610
Nineteen 79,
the Islamic revolution started in Iran.

107
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,610
The supreme leader back then was the 
Ayatollah Khomeini,

108
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,473
and he knew that the army might be 
transit anymore decades of saving the 

109
00:06:01,241 --> 00:06:02,074
shower pleasure.
It was hard for them to change their 

110
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:04,114
loyalties overnight.
This is why in order to avoid acute ta 

111
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:08,500
come and he created his own parallel 
army.

112
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,680
This is how the Islamic Revolutionary 
Guard was created.

113
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:12,543
It's a sort of modern day Praetorian God
designed to preserve the Islamic 

114
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,430
republican system.
In the beginning,

115
00:06:18,490 --> 00:06:21,380
all of the members were volunteers,
but things changed in the eight.

116
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:25,170
Hmm.

117
00:06:25,170 --> 00:06:27,960
Back then,
Iran started a war with Iraq and who did

118
00:06:27,961 --> 00:06:29,580
they send to the front?
Of course,

119
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:32,700
they sent these Praetorian,
see why willing to do anything for their

120
00:06:32,701 --> 00:06:37,701
cause and do you know what,
in times of warfare,

121
00:06:40,131 --> 00:06:40,964
there's always money for weapons.
This is how the Islamic revolution 

122
00:06:44,661 --> 00:06:45,494
regard gained a lot more influence and 
certainly anymore weaponry and 

123
00:06:48,291 --> 00:06:50,090
experience.
By the end of the Iran,

124
00:06:50,091 --> 00:06:50,924
Iraq war,
this Praetorian God already had more 

125
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:53,204
than 130,000 soldiers,
plus many other smaller cause that 

126
00:06:56,330 --> 00:06:56,950
dependence

127
00:06:56,950 --> 00:06:58,560
them

128
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,273
today.
This revolution regard hasn't signed 

129
00:07:06,570 --> 00:07:07,403
intelligence service parallel to the 
government's Ministry of Intelligence 

130
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:10,913
and they can imprison people and 
investigate them without us even 

131
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:15,600
reporting to the authorities.
In other words,

132
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:18,480
they are the cornerstone of the Islamic 
revolution,

133
00:07:18,481 --> 00:07:19,314
but then again,
they do have this parallel system and 

134
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,490
well,
why are they important?

135
00:07:30,050 --> 00:07:30,831
Well,
the truth is,

136
00:07:30,831 --> 00:07:31,664
as far as the economy goes,
it's hard to create an alternative to 

137
00:07:33,771 --> 00:07:34,604
the system.
If you have an elite corp spying on any 

138
00:07:37,070 --> 00:07:37,903
would be political activists and yeah,
we really are talking about an elite 

139
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:41,743
core here.
They're perfectly trained for hybrid 

140
00:07:43,341 --> 00:07:44,174
warfare.
They fought in many other wars such as 

141
00:07:45,981 --> 00:07:46,970
in Syria,
Iraq,

142
00:07:46,971 --> 00:07:50,570
and even in Afghanistan,
and all of the experts say that training

143
00:07:50,660 --> 00:07:51,680
as well as class.

144
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,460
You might be wondering.
I mean,

145
00:07:57,461 --> 00:07:58,294
we talked about weapons.
How do they buy weapons if Iran is so 

146
00:08:00,581 --> 00:08:03,880
isolated from the international market?
How on earth is that possible?

147
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,440
Well,
the truth is that for decades,

148
00:08:05,441 --> 00:08:08,140
Ron has had its own weapons 
manufacturing industry.

149
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,490
Yep.
You had that right.

150
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:10,593
They use Chinese and Russian designs,
but the manufacturing is all done in 

151
00:08:12,941 --> 00:08:13,774
Iran.
So now of course the question becomes 

152
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:18,010
will they be affected by these economic 
sanctions?

153
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:19,000
I mean,
at the end of the day,

154
00:08:19,001 --> 00:08:19,834
if Iran has no money,
there's got to be able to buy bullets 

155
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:23,200
and weapons.
Right?

156
00:08:23,410 --> 00:08:24,460
Well,
if you are,

157
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,500
the reality is nothing

158
00:08:35,330 --> 00:08:36,163
external pressure and black.
A foreign competitors will most likely 

159
00:08:38,901 --> 00:08:43,400
help the Irg see further consolidate 
it's grip over Iran's economy.

160
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:47,420
Ali Elforni,
Arab Gulf states institute in Washington

161
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:48,523
for better understanding,
a big portion of Iran's economy is in 

162
00:08:51,141 --> 00:08:51,974
the revolution regards hands.
They own many statement or police 

163
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,200
cleaning oil companies,
refineries and real estate firms.

164
00:08:58,350 --> 00:08:59,183
For example,
51 percent of Iran telecom belongs to 

165
00:09:01,231 --> 00:09:02,100
them.
Add to this,

166
00:09:02,101 --> 00:09:02,934
the fact they pay almost no taxes and do
you have completely self sustainable 

167
00:09:05,881 --> 00:09:09,030
economics with a parallel army that so 
well maintained?

168
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,820
It's hard to have regime change well 
bus,

169
00:09:11,821 --> 00:09:14,160
if you've thought this was the only 
asset that the ayatollah does have,

170
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:17,100
well you'd be wrong,
and now you're going to see why

171
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,430
China comes to the rescue.
We've said this many times in this three

172
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:28,550
video series,
China will keep buying oil from Iran.

173
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,473
They just can't stop doing this.
China needs a lot of oil and for years 

174
00:09:33,411 --> 00:09:35,750
Iran has been there six most important 
supplier.

175
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,590
We're talking about more than 800,000 
barrels that come from Iran every single

176
00:09:39,591 --> 00:09:40,760
day.
With these numbers.

177
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,770
It's really hard to change providers 
and.

178
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,191
Yeah.
Yeah,

179
00:09:43,191 --> 00:09:44,450
I know what you're thinking.
Probably right now.

180
00:09:44,451 --> 00:09:46,640
You've probably seen those previous 
videos and you're thinking,

181
00:09:46,641 --> 00:09:47,474
well,
America has got that secret weapon 

182
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:51,290
that's going to keep countries from 
buying Iranian oil.

183
00:09:55,400 --> 00:09:58,490
As we talked about in the last video,
basically no tanker can dock in a harbor

184
00:09:58,491 --> 00:09:59,324
if it's not covered by an insurance 
company in most of the insurance 

185
00:10:01,221 --> 00:10:03,680
companies.
Well the European or American.

186
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:04,753
So now the question comes is how does 
China buy oil from Iran with this 

187
00:10:08,391 --> 00:10:09,530
problem?
Well,

188
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:10,453
check this out.

189
00:10:15,270 --> 00:10:16,103
Elusive.
China's shifts to Iranian tankers to 

190
00:10:18,301 --> 00:10:21,570
keep oil flowing a mid US sanctions.
Yeah,

191
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,730
you have that right.
Without insurance companies,

192
00:10:23,731 --> 00:10:28,290
Iran will take care of the transport and
bad all of the risk and this.

193
00:10:28,291 --> 00:10:29,124
Well,
this is pretty great for the people 

194
00:10:29,881 --> 00:10:32,670
receiving the oil before that have to 
worry about maintenance,

195
00:10:32,671 --> 00:10:33,504
but now they're on bays.
They'd have to worry about a ship now 

196
00:10:35,681 --> 00:10:37,440
reaching its destination.
Don't worry.

197
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,280
Iran spaying ships things in the.
See something terrible happens again,

198
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:44,640
Iran pays,
but this is still not the whole story.

199
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:45,633
Think about it.
If the rest of the world is going to 

200
00:10:46,681 --> 00:10:49,110
stop investing in Iran,
what do we have left?

201
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,153
Exactly.
We've just freed up space for China's 

202
00:10:51,811 --> 00:10:54,720
money.
Hence news like this

203
00:10:58,890 --> 00:10:59,723
Chinese

204
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:03,720
from to invest $2,000,000,000 an oil 
refinery in Iran.

205
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:05,370
Yeah.
Yeah.

206
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:08,520
You heard that right?
China is taking advantage of the void.

207
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:10,260
Other companies have all act.
In fact,

208
00:11:10,261 --> 00:11:13,710
they are even buying the investments.
Other European companies have nate,

209
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:14,830
for example,
of this type,

210
00:11:14,831 --> 00:11:15,664
all the French oil company in 2016,
they started building what was meant to 

211
00:11:18,571 --> 00:11:22,830
be the biggest gas field on the planet.
Now with trump sanctions,

212
00:11:22,831 --> 00:11:25,410
chances are they're going to have to 
retard this projects.

213
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:27,660
Guests who's ready to buy it.
Well,

214
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:28,950
that would be China

215
00:11:31,730 --> 00:11:32,250
this summer

216
00:11:32,250 --> 00:11:33,083
in 2018,
the trend of development bank announced 

217
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:35,993
that they will provide more than $15,
billion dollars in loans for all kinds 

218
00:11:38,791 --> 00:11:39,624
of things.

219
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,920
Gotcha.
Might

220
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:47,270
wonder in the grand scheme of things,
is this a lot of money or not so much?

221
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:48,523
Well,
it has already helped to start building 

222
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:52,910
five brand new hospitals.
And then what about other companies?

223
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:53,903
Really when I told you that Iran is one 
of the biggest car manufacturers in the 

224
00:11:56,051 --> 00:11:56,830
region.
Well,

225
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:57,663
one of the main brands there is cyber.
They've already signed a joint venture 

226
00:12:00,431 --> 00:12:02,560
with another Chinese company called 
Brilliance,

227
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:04,570
but this,
this is just the beginning.

228
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:07,810
Was the most ambitious projects 
currently going on from China?

229
00:12:07,811 --> 00:12:08,501
Well,
yeah.

230
00:12:08,501 --> 00:12:10,960
That's the one belt.
One road projects.

231
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,420
That's the new Silk Road that shooting 
pain wants to build.

232
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:19,813
I's Iran as important belt and road pub.
So far they've already started to 

233
00:12:23,391 --> 00:12:24,224
renovate several railroads.
The idea is to connect the main Iranian 

234
00:12:27,411 --> 00:12:28,244
cities with high speed train so that 
they can transport goods and now you 

235
00:12:31,131 --> 00:12:32,030
might be wondering,
well,

236
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,360
why is it so important?
Well,

237
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,890
just have a look at this map and Milan.

238
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:43,273
Imagine a train full of mobile phones 
traveling from China going through 

239
00:12:45,531 --> 00:12:47,930
Central Asia and then going from Iran to
Turkey.

240
00:12:48,150 --> 00:12:51,170
It looks like the perfect group for 
trying to just sell mobile phones.

241
00:12:51,171 --> 00:12:52,820
Dr. Right now,
of course,

242
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:54,430
this is just one idea.
So far,

243
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,410
Chinese businesses are already facing 
many issues in central Asia,

244
00:12:57,411 --> 00:13:00,620
but this is definitely a massive friend 
of the video.

245
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,400
The truth is China is starting to invest
heavily in Iran.

246
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:07,730
Does this mean that Xi Jinping will save
arounds economy?

247
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:08,851
Of course.
Nice,

248
00:13:08,851 --> 00:13:12,140
but will this be enough for the regime 
to survive?

249
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,270
Well,
just maybe,

250
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,283
and this explains why in recent years 
the political relations between these 

251
00:13:17,781 --> 00:13:20,510
two countries are becoming more and more
fluid.

252
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:29,330
Ping Holtz talks with President Hassan 
Rouhani of Iran.

253
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:30,253
So now is your time.
Do you really think that trump's 

254
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,040
sanctions will help end the ayatollah's 
regime?

255
